SECURING BUILDINGS VS. CONTROLLING FIREARMS; RAMPANT GUN CRIME DEMANDS 
COMPREHENSIVE CURBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the besieged, law-abiding residents of the Robert Taylor Homes and nearby 
Stateway Gardens project, both in Chicago, President Clinton's call Saturday 
for stepped up security measures at public-housing facilities must come as some 
small comfort. These projects, not unlike too many other poor neighborhoods in 
Los Angeles and across the country, have become virtual free-fire zones. 
Residents there live in terror amid relentless, violent crime. Warfare between 
rival gangs in the two Chicago projects over Easter resulted in 300 shooting 
incidents in just four days. 
</P>
<P>
 THE PLAN: Clinton and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G. 
Cisneros outlined steps that housing officials in Chicago and elsewhere can use 
to regain control of their buildings from gangs and drug dealers. These include 
the use of armed police and metal detectors at building entrances, construction 
of fences, weapons searches in common areas, such as grounds and stairwells, 
and frisking of individuals believed to have been involved in a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy came in response to a ruling by a federal judge in Chicago that 
wisely blocked authorities from conducting sweeps of apartments in search of 
weapons. Such mass searches without probable cause violate the Fourth 
Amendement's ban on unreasonable searches and seizure, the court said.  
</P>
<P>
 The new Clinton policy may face another court test. And even if the 
Administration prevails, project residents, including children, must still 
place themselves in mortal danger off the project grounds just by walking to 
school or the market. They will still risk gun death or injury from a domestic 
squabble or an accidental shooting in their own apartment unit, upstairs from 
the metal detectors, out of sight of the housing police. 
</P>
<P>
 But to our mind, the President's policy, and the largely sympathetic response 
it has generated, is more noteworthy for what it reveals about our 
unwillingness, as a nation, to address directly the wild proliferation of guns 
and gun crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Metal detectors in the lobbies of public-housing projects? Sure. Add them to 
the list of "secured" facilities in our midst: schools, banks, courthouses, 
airports. These measures help to a point. But that point is usually at the 
building's perimeter.  
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, banks increasingly shield tellers behind bulletproof windows; 
guards watch each door. Not surprisingly, criminals now find banks harder 
targets -- bank robberies in Southern California dropped 37% last year over 
1992, according to the FBI. But in some cases criminals are moving, literally, 
across the street to busy supermarkets where cash drawers are temptingly near 
the store's entrance. And gun crime continues wickedly apace in the streets, 
where no metal detectors can be installed to prevent carjackings, drive-by 
shootings and muggings. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CHOICE: The stark choice is between more metal detectors, more 
bullet-proof barriers, more fear and crime in the streets -- or comprehensive 
gun control. Between these options, there is no real choice. Yet, a chimerical 
interpretation of the Second Amendment along with hefty contributions from the 
National Rifle Assn. seem to have clouded the vision of too many lawmakers.  
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Sunday that supporters of a federal 
assault-weapons ban are 15 to 20 votes short of passage in the House. The 
Senate crime bill, passed last fall, contains such a ban but the House version, 
up for more debate this week, does not. It must.  
</P>
<P>
 And in Sacramento, a thoughtful, much-needed bill that would severely restrict 
private possession of handguns faces its first committee test today . Passage 
of AB 3210 should be regarded by all Californians as the first step away from 
the efforts to secure more and more buildings -- but that succeed only in 
channeling more gun crime into the streets.

A SENTENCE FROM THE DARK AGES; FLOGGING IS BARBARIC TORTURE; SINGAPORE'S 
PRESIDENT SHOULD GRANT MICHAEL FAY CLEMENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Our unease over the flogging sentence meted out to an American youth in 
Singapore increases with news reports giving credence to his claim that he was 
coerced into confessing by threats of beating and prolonged interrogation in a 
refrigerated room. A ruling on the 18-year-old's final appeal for clemency to 
President Ong Teng Cheong is due soon. We hope the president considers this 
claim, and the well-documented flaws in Singapore's authoritarian system of 
criminal justice. 
</P>
<P>
 If turned down, Michael Peter Fay faces six strokes of a sodden rattan cane 
across his bare buttocks, delivered by a martial-arts expert. This bloody 
lashing tears away pieces of flesh, is excruciatingly painful and leaves 
permanent scars. It amounts to the kind of torture outlawed by United Nations 
treaties and officially renounced by nearly all civilized countries except 
Singapore, Trinidad and Tobago, Brunei, Malaysia and a few others. President 
Clinton has personally urged clemency. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay, with no prior criminal record, confessed to spray-painting cars and 
possessing stolen property. He was sentenced to four months in jail, a $2,000 
fine and caning. Fay says he confessed after a Malaysian youth arrested with 
him emerged from interrogation bloodied and beaten. He also cited fear of 
prolonged questioning in a refrigerated "air con" room where police grill the 
prisoner clad only in his underwear. 
</P>
<P>
 Such claims might be dismissed as desperate excuses to avoid punishment. But 
they are given credence by the reports of political dissidents who have 
suffered through questioning and beatings in the air-con room. 
</P>
<P>
 The Singaporean ambassador, S. R. Nathan, writes: "Our laws protect the 
majority of law-abiding citizens. Criminals cannot escape justice on the excuse 
of 'victimhood.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Many Americans have voiced admiration for Singapore's no-nonsense approach. 
But Singapore has dispensed with jury trials, abridged the right to legal 
counsel and the right against self-incrimination and allows prolonged detention 
without trial or charges for suspected gangsters and drug traffickers. 
Presumably juries and defense lawyers are just superfluous niceties that get in 
the way of clean streets and law-abiding citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore has made much of the evenhandedness of its justice, that Fay was 
getting only what local criminals can expect. It is comforting to know that 
foreigners and Singaporeans alike have equal access to the air-con room and 
caning bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it not time for Singapore to examine its authoritarian and potentially 
unfair legal system to make it conform to modern standards -- not of leniency, 
but due process? President Ong can take the first step by commuting the 
barbaric sentence of Michael Peter Fay.

POST-QUAKE CALARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "CalArts: A School Goes to School," editorial, April 4: 
</P>
<P>
 I am sure that everyone in the CalArts community is glad to have some 
publicity in The Times in the hopes that the larger arts community will come to 
its aid. Unfortunately, in the meantime, things are not as rosy for the 
students as has been portrayed. 
</P>
<P>
 To suggest that we "have had the rare luck to be enrolled" during all of this 
is absurd. Perhaps if I were studying carpentry or urban planning this 
earthquake would have been a lucky educational experience, but I am studying 
music at CalArts. The experience of not having adequate practice space or 
access to equipment is in no way going to help me in my education. The hours I 
spend driving (and sitting in traffic) to get to the seven separate locations 
(from Hollywood to Rye Canyon) where I have classes would definitely be better 
spent practicing. That I have no regular access to a library, that the content 
of courses is often at best 50% of what it ought to be -- these things are not 
going to help me in the music world. Because the school is so fragmented, I no 
longer have the chance to see other students' work from the art, theater, film, 
animation and dance schools. I don't see about half of my colleagues in the 
music school. Does this somehow enrich my education? 
</P>
<P>
 I do not mean to place blame on anything but the circumstances caused by the 
earthquake for this. But, I do not want to be patronized. In addresses from our 
president, Steven Lavine, other administrators and your editorial, we are led 
to believe that everything is great, perhaps even better since the quake. No 
one knows better than the students that this is simply not true. I understand 
and expect that my education is not what it would have been for this semester. 
The school's administration is doing what it can to get us through this, and 
for the most part is doing a good job. However, to tell me I am better off 
having gone through this is not only angering, but offensive.

<TEXT>
<P>
 * Regarding the article by A.J. Bacevich (Commentary, April 1), I would like 
to ask him a question. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a concern, of course, to all of us in our country that our military in 
Somalia fired on and killed a pregnant woman and 12 other civilians, as stated 
in his article.Bacevich implies that we should not expose our military to 
situations where these unfortunate isolated incidents can happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps he would prefer that we had not gone to Somalia and had let the local 
military continue its wholesale slaughter and let the starvation go on and on. 
This seems to be the conclusion from his article. I believe we took the right 
action, although maybe we pulled out too soon.

INTEREST RATE HIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Remember the "soft landing"? That was Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan 
Greenspan's attempt in 1990 to "cool off" an "overheated" economy, lest America 
be consumed by inflation. The Fed maintained a tight-money policy amid growing 
demand for capital.The economy landed softly, all right -- right into 
quicksand. It began sinking by the summer of 1990, then plunged like an anvil 
once Congress approved George Bush's "read my lips" tax increase. Thanks to 
Greenspan and Bush, the 1990 recession and the, until recently, imperceptible 
"recovery" were under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Greenspan is poised for an encore. After President Clinton's $241 billion 
tax hike, designed to reduce the deficit and lower interest rates, the Fed has 
seen the last two quarters of welcome economic growth and fled for the comfort 
of higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to combat an imaginary inflation problem (the 1994 Consumer Price 
Index is up a whopping 1.9%), the Fed seems prepared to shred today's healthy 
expansion. With taxes and regulation on the rise, higher-priced capital will 
remove the one factor keeping the economy afloat.  
</P>
<P>
 If Greenspan has any empathy for the millions of Americans who are being 
hired, buying new homes and paying their bills on time for a change, he will 
stop running from the make-believe inflationary bogyman and instead allow this 
mantra to guide his economic actions: Let it grow.

WORLD POPULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to Donella Meadows' Column Left, "We Already Number Too Many," 
April 5: 
</P>
<P>
 Meadows presents an argument -- put forth by Professor David Pimentel -- that 
is certainly timely, compelling and profound. The human population of the Earth 
is rising at a worrisome rate and, unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any 
morally acceptable way to deal with this grave problem at this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Regretfully, what is missing from her article is the culpability of the United 
States in this world juggernaut. Clearly it has been a major focus of our 
government over the last 30 or 40 years to teach, train and/or compel other 
(non-Anglo) cultures and societies around the globe to accept "our" way. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, and with altruistic delight, our government and too many 
Americans erroneously believe we're helping these societies "progress" -- 
America's reward for helping these societies' "progress" is, of course, cheap 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of diverting America's resources -- in the form of imports -- to 
these "progressing" societies has been a great increase in their respective 
populations; the caveat being that these "progressing" societies appear to be 
hopelessly attached to the American market, i.e., resources that are feeding 
their families and burgeoning populations. If for whatever reason there is ever 
a disruption in the American market, and their American umbilical cord is 
severed, these "progressing" societies are going to have a serious problem on 
their hands as to how to feed their people. 
</P>
<P>

 * Meadows seems to be impressed by the "number-crunching paper" of Pimentel, 
who says we need to reduce the world population by two-thirds by the year 2100 
or we will all be living in poverty, famine and disease. Here are a few numbers 
she may not have crunched: 
</P>
<P>
 If you take the current population of the world (6 billion) and divide it up 
into families of four (1.5 billion families), then take each of those 1.5 
billion families and give them each one acre to live on, the entire population 
of the world would fit in Australia (2.9 million square miles times 640 
acres/square mile equals nearly 1.9 billion acres). 
</P>
<P>
 If you took those same families and gave them a three-bedroom house on a 
suburban-size lot, the entire population of the world would fit in Texas.  
</P>
<P>
 These numbers are not what you hear from the "doom and gloom" population 
control crowd, but you can see by doing your own number-crunching that they are 
true.

 * Not to worry, human world population will be reduced to a level that can be 
permanently sustained by one of only two possible means. 
</P>

 Painlessly, by the use of our superior intellect to apply self-restraint. Or 
Mother Nature will do it for us. Brutally, the way it does for all living 
creatures.

 * Shame on you, L.A. Times. You missed the story. As you reported in your 
April 2 Times Poll article ("Residents Balk When Asked to Pay for '3 Strikes' 
"), many Californians do not want to pay higher taxes to finance construction 
of more prisons.But, according to your own poll, more Californians would be 
willing to accept a tax increase to fund the new prisons needed under the 
"three strikes" law. Here in the birthplace of the modern tax revolt, I'd say 
that's the story!

 * In your April 9 "Crime Watch" editorial, you once again speak against the 
"three strikes" law, citing "the need for many more trials as felons refuse 
plea bargains." You seem to completely overlook the fact that these additional 
trials will be the last trials for these individuals. We will not be burdened 
with arresting and trying these particular felons ever again, not to mention 
the savings to their potential future victims. If, as you say, it is too 
expensive to imprison these criminals for life, why do you constantly recommend 
life imprisonment instead of the death penalty, where it is warranted?

By EILEEN MEIER PETERSON of Maryland, a law student and a nurse, comments on 
watching a friend die of cancer, unable to try a promising experimental 
treatment. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My friend Cindy died five months ago of metastatic breast cancer. There is a 
new drug that provides hope for a lasting remission for the 1.6 million women 
in this country who, like Cindy, suffer from breast cancer that has not 
responded to other medical treatments.But these women cannot receive the drug 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because the drug is RU-486, the so-called abortion pill, and the pro-life 
movement opposes it. A modified version of RU-486 shows promise for women 
resistant to tamoxifen, widely used for treating advanced breast cancer. But 
even if the FDA approves RU-486 for this use, the manufacturer is unwilling to 
distribute it here because of promises of boycotts and harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 One evening, when Cindy could no longer walk and would cry from uncontrollable 
pain, she said to me, "I'm sorry. This is the best I can do." I hope many more 
women do not have to die before our policymakers find the courage to say, "This 
is not the best we can do; we can do much more."

<P>
 "It's so nice to have a man around the house," cooed a 1950s pop song. In the 
'90s, could that same sentiment lead to a fix for our social problems? 
Suddenly, we are hearing about marriage as the cure-all for poverty, drug 
abuse, crime and declining levels of education. Many welfare reformers propose 
that women be coerced to slip on wedding rings before they pick up their Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children checks. Even Bill Clinton -- for whom welfare 
reform is usually tied to education and day care -- touted marriage for welfare 
moms in his State of the Union speech. 
</P>
<P>
 But do we really want a 15-year-old to marry her gang-member boyfriend, so 
their toddler can be caught in the cross-fire? How about the woman who has just 
given birth to the child of a crack addict? A good family is wonderful, but a 
dysfunctional family is not, nor is it a solution to drug abuse and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was growing up in the '50s, girls married if they got pregnant. Too 
often, that was what family values meant. Let me tell you about some of those 
family values in families I knew. One woman was married to a Navy officer who 
regularly beat her. She put on heavy make-up and tried to pretend it didn't 
happen. Another wed an alcoholic who was abusive to their four children. She 
remembers driving her car along a highway watching the telephone poles go by, 
trying to work up the nerve to smash her car into them to end her misery. (She 
didn't. She went home and threw her husband out, got a job and made something 
of her life.) 
</P>
<P>
 That old song waxes sentimental about "a guy in pipe and slippers who will 
help to zip your zippers," and if every marriage produced a loving home, I'd 
join those calling for pregnant girls to get married. Unfortunately, this is 
not the case. There were nearly as many teen-age pregnancies in the 1950s as 
there are today, the difference then being that the couples got married. One 
result: a soaring divorce rate as those marriages collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton also talked of making young women who have babies stay at 
home with their parents or guardians, to break the cycle in which the welfare 
department takes the place of the father. But often, the home is a place of 
misery for poor girls. I remember being shown the window of an urban housing 
project, and my guide commented that the apartment to which it belonged housed 
three generations of women on crack -- daughter, mother and granddaughter. 
Getting a young mother out of this environment makes more sense than forcing 
her to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Murray, author of "Losing Ground," advocates getting rid of welfare 
altogether. Murray says that relatives will pitch in and help out with kids. 
Who will do the "pitching in" in that housing-project apartment?  
</P>
<P>
 Republican Bill Bennett, the former secretary of education, wants to 
immediately end welfare for unmarried mothers. What does he suggest in its 
place? "We must invest generously in the kind of orphanages and group homes 
that provide order and care." Shades of Charles Dickens! Indeed, small, 
well-run orphanages may help care for children in an overburdened foster-care 
system. But the idea that we should penalize poor, unmarried mothers -- many of 
them good mothers -- by taking their children away boggles the mind. The cost 
of such a program would be enormous and history tells us what a rotten job 
we've done with other large-scale institutions such as psychiatric hospitals 
and reform schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegitimacy wasn't created by welfare. Early in the 1960s, sociologist Oscar 
Lewis found the same social patterns in the slums of Rio, in American cities, 
among poor rural whites and Native Americans: "Few will marry. For men who have 
no steady jobs, no property and no prospect of wealth to pass on to their 
children, who live in the present without expectations of the future, a free 
union makes good sense. The women, for their part, will turn down offers of 
marriage from men who are likely to be immature, punishing and generally 
unreliable." A poverty culture flourished where community and other social 
systems were in decay. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short run, giving women access to contraception, job training and 
decent day care will assure that children have at least one responsible parent. 
Broadening the idea of manhood beyond breadwinning will also help; a father can 
love and care for a child, and the experience will enhance his life even if 
he's not the right partner for a marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Marriage is a wonderful institution, the source of love, joy and nurture. But 
it's not a quick fix for social problems.

COLUMN LEFT/ ALEXANDER COCKBURN: REMEMBER GEORGE BUSH, 'MR. GREEN'?; IN MONTANA 
AND THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST, DEMOCRATS GIVE IN TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL PILLAGERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER COCKBURN, Alexander Cockburn writes for the Nation and other 
publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Back at the start of his term, George Bush boasted, "I'm going to be the 
environmental President."  
</P>
<P>
 Given what came after him, he was right.  
</P>
<P>
 His were the years, after the pillage of the Reagan era, when the chain saws 
in the Pacific Northwest slowed almost to a murmur. A Reagan-appointed judge, 
William Dwyer, ruled in federal court in Seattle in favor of environmentalists 
in the spotted owl suit. This splendid jurist has been tougher than the 
mainstream "greens" ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 In Congress and the courts, in those halcyon years, there was gridlock, 
otherwise known as holding the bad guys at bay, which is about the best we can 
hope for.  
</P>
<P>
 In came the Clinton crowd and promptly began sellouts to industry the 
Republicans hadn't dared dream of. Democrats in Congress who'd said "No" to 
Bush fell into line. The major environmental groups boasted of "access" to the 
White House.  
</P>
<P>
 Take the nation's forests on federally-owned public lands. For them, April has 
been the cruelest of months.  
</P>
<P>
 The Montana wilderness bill, sponsored by Rep. Pat Williams (D-Mont.), has 
cleared the Natural Resources Committee and awaits a vote in the House. The 
bill is the climax of a 16-year fight by the timber industry to open up about 4 
million acres of roadless wilderness in the northern Rockies, the last U.S. 
stronghold of the wolf and grizzly outside Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a deal approved by the major environmental groups -- Sierra Club, 
Audubon, Wilderness Society, National Wildlife Federation -- 1.7 million acres 
of rocks and ice will be preserved as wilderness while the timber companies 
stand to get everything else. To put it another way, with this bill the 
corporate timber industry and log exporters get 96% of the productive public 
forest land in Montana and roughly $60 million a year in timber subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 Resistance to this surrender by the big environmental groups has been led by 
the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and dissident local Sierra Club chapters, 
which have fought gallantly against vast odds.  
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the Clinton gang went before Dwyer in Seattle with its final 
formulation for the Pacific Northwest forest. The Clinton plan permits logging 
of up to 40% of the remaining unprotected native and ancient forest in the 
Pacific Northwest. Have the months of protest brought any mitigation? The 
government gave the environmentalists a small chip in the form of increased 
protection for salmon (though another federal judge has just ruled that the 
Clinton plan for the Columbia Basin salmon is a cosmetic fraud; it was designed 
to benefit the aluminum industry). On the other hand, the timber industry won 
diminished owl protection on private lands and on national forest lands in 
Northern California.  
</P>
<P>
 At the very last minute, the Administration amended the plan to excise any 
compulsory requirement to assess watersheds before logging. This will permit 
timber sales to move up by a matter of about two years. Diminishing even 
further the protection of ancient stands of redwood and Douglas fir, the plan 
now permits "thinning" and "salvage timber" sales (in and of itself an enormous 
loophole) without prior environmental review. Yet these were the old-growth 
stands that the Clinton plan, known as Option 9, pretended to protect. In 
southern Oregon, 225,000 acres originally protected as habitat for a threatened 
bird, the marbled murrelet, has been released for clear-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, the Option 9 story has been one of appeasement and surrender by 
the big environmental organizations. And if these organizations choose not to 
press their suit against the government, then there's nothing Dwyer can do, and 
new timber sales in the last remnant of the native and ancient Northwest Forest 
could begin in June. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for forests. Rangelands fare scarcely better, with utter collapse by 
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt in the face of the ranching lobby and the big 
water users in the West. There's been weakening of Superfund and the Clean 
Water Act, weakening of pesticide standards and of the Endangered Species Act, 
and -- across the board -- the erosion of strict regulation in favor of 
"compromises" (actually abject surrenders to the rape-and-pillage crowd). 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the press has mostly been asleep and the major environmental 
organizations are frolicking happily on the White House lawn, objects of 
derision and contempt to grass-roots environmental organizers across the 
country.  
</P>
<P>
 This is what a Democrat in the White House has brought us. Yes, indeed. Where 
are you, George, now that we need you?

BOOK REVIEW / SHORT STORIES; VISIONARY GLIMPSES OF LOST LOVE AND UNEXPECTED 
CONNECTIONS; LIVING TO BE A HUNDRED: STORIES BY ROBERT BOSWELL; ALFRED A. KNOPF 
$20, 187 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By CHRIS GOODRICH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the short story "The Products of Love," the narrator attempts to decipher 
the curious history of a woman named Paula, with whom he has fallen in love 
despite her marriage to Eugene, also a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 He queries Paula and Eugene, separately and together, and eventually comes up 
with enough material to reconstruct her story. "It came out in pieces," the 
narrator writes, "like a child's elaborate toy. It's taken concentration, and 
some guesswork, to assemble the parts." But he has done the job -- and 
discovered that he was part of Paula's tale, perhaps even its punch line. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Products of Love" is not the best story in this exceptional second 
collection by Robert Boswell, author of the novels "Crooked Hearts" and 
"Mystery Ride," but it's representative of the book's themes -- lost love, 
mysterious pasts, missed and unexpected connections. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the stories are romantic, but in the visionary rather than the amorous 
sense. Few readers would be willing to trade places with Boswell's characters: 
the shopkeeper in "The Earth's Crown," whose wife becomes intermittently 
demented following the death of their infant daughter; the boy in "Glissando," 
who learns about scamming from his father, about sex from his father's 
mistress; the woman in "Grief," who hates her dead daughter's boyfriend, Scott, 
because she needs someone to blame for the girl's untimely death. Boswell's 
characters are people pushed close to, and sometimes beyond, their limits, to 
the point that they comprehend things that otherwise would have eluded them.  
</P>
<P>
 Some stories in "Living to Be a Hundred" make you think of Raymond Carver, the 
bright star in the minimalist writing firmament who now seems headed for 
eclipse. And it's writers like Boswell who will perform the overshadowing, 
because his stories contain a richness that the minimalists, thinking richness 
misleading and untrue to life, deliberately avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal construction workers in this book's title story, for example, 
aren't drunks and ne'er-do-wells: The narrator is fully aware that his dream of 
being an archeologist hasn't been sold out so much as "siphoned off," while his 
partner, Harvis, can articulate the exact moment in his youth that he gave up 
purse-snatching. Lernic is the story's one stereotypical laborer -- a blowhard 
asking for trouble, which he gets from the usually peaceable Harvis in the 
story's climactic scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Boswell is strongly attracted to petty criminals and blue-collar workers, 
lowlifes and laborers, people who haven't gotten many breaks in life. But his 
range is broader than that: "Rain" deals with two women who fall in love in the 
course of searching for a missing child; "The Good Man" with an alcoholic 
reporter's downward spiral; "Salt Commons" with a Jim Thompson-esque kidnaping 
and its unanticipated aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever a story's ostensible subject, though, Boswell approaches it with 
uncommon sympathy, giving his characters the benefit of the doubt they never 
seem to get in life. The would-be killer in "Salt Commons" turns out to be 
quite funny, unlike her victim, the mournful, middle-aged Paul; the teacher in 
"Imagining Spaniards" appears to be going crazy, but Boswell humanizes him with 
a seriocomic scene in which a young nurse confesses, while examining his 
private parts, that he was her favorite instructor in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 No, you wouldn't want to be Scott or Harvis or Paul, but you're glad to know 
more about them, to see the roads not taken and better appreciate the fellow 
travelers on intersecting avenues ahead.

THEATER REVIEWS; 'THE WOOD DEMON': A TALE OF TWO CASTS AT THE TAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A theatrical production is never truly frozen -- it can change with each new 
performance, each new audience. Frank Dwyer's staging of Chekhov's "The Wood 
Demon" at the Mark Taper Forum takes advantage of this fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Each role has been learned by three actors. In some roles, two actors split 
the number of performances evenly, with the third serving as understudy. In 
other cases, one actor plays the role most of the time but another is 
guaranteed as many as eight performances. So the configuration of the cast is 
likely to change from each performance to the next. 
</P>
<P>
 In the initial Times review (April 8), comment on individual actors was 
postponed until another cast had also been seen. On Saturday night, another 
cast was seen. It's time for a few notes: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of men who did the same role in both performances are the 
production's comic spark plugs. Dakin Matthews' crusty Prof. Serebryakov makes 
his second-act snit truly delicious -- as long as you're not related to him -- 
and he has the flashing eyes of a man besieged by inferiors. One of those 
inferiors, Eric Allan Kramer's Fedya, long-haired and exotically costumed (by 
Holly Poe Durbin), is as vital and virile as he is vulgar. His swagger is 
unforgettable. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's soul is the title character, played in both reviewed casts by Mark 
Harelik with the requisite magnetism, yet with the proper dash of 
self-righteousness as well. It's a role that could become unbearable in lesser 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other actors kept the same role at both performances. As the beaming 
father of the aforementioned Fedya, co-translator Nicholas Saunders takes 
irresistible delight in watching the younger generations. Anne Gee Byrd's 
matriarch is temperamentally his opposite, but she has a great, passionate 
moment when she hears the fate of her son. 
</P>
<P>
 The most interesting casting experiment: Nike Doukas played girlish Sonya on 
opening night, then the older, more remote Yelena on Saturday. Too bad it 
didn't work -- Doukas is much better as Sonya. Her voice has a high but husky 
tone that sounds too juvenile for Yelena, who was better played by stately 
Lorraine Toussaint on opening night. Doukas' Yelena also looks too much like 
her successor as Sonya, Rose Portillo, who is equally wonderful in the role. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The two actors who play Zhorzh look quite a bit different. Lawrence Pressman 
is disheveled and desperate from the beginning, while Dan Kern has a natty 
quality that starts to come apart at the seams in the second act. Both 
approaches yield valuable results. 
</P>
<P>
 Big John Apicella and the smaller Jeremy Lawrence look like opposites, yet 
they swap the roles of the talkative Waffles and a silent luncheon guest to 
great comic effect. Finally, while both Raphael Sbarge and John Walcutt are 
funny and frantic as a rich young landowner, Janellen Steininger is better cast 
as his sister than Marsha Dietlein, who's too tall to fit the script's 
specifications. 
</P>

 * "The Wood Demon," Mark Taper Forum, 135 N. Grand Ave. Tuesdays-Saturdays, 8 
p.m.; Saturday-Sunday matinees, 2:30 p.m.; Sundays, 7:30 p.m. Ends May 21.

 'Piano's' Sour Note: Following in the footsteps of Steven Spielberg's 
"Schindler's List," "The Piano" has drawn objections from foreign censors. The 
Philippine Movie and Television Review and Classification Board has banned "The 
Piano" in that country, calling love scenes between stars Holly Hunter and 
Harvey Keitel pornographic and "unfit for public viewing." On Monday, director 
Jane Campion -- the second woman ever to be nominated for a best director Oscar 
-- rejected proposed cuts in the film, saying "the scenes in question are 
handled artistically and tastefully and cannot possibly be deemed to be 
offensive." The film board said it would review the ban again Tuesday, after an 
appeal by the local distributor of the film, which won three Academy Awards 
including best actress for Hunter. The same film board raised a storm last 
month by ordering cuts on Spielberg's "Schindler's List." President Fidel Ramos 
later reversed the ban, however. 
</P>
<P>
 * Viewers' Choice: The Oscars may be long gone, but at least one more awards 
show is yet to come. Nominees were announced Monday for the 1994 MTV Movie 
Awards, which will air on the cable channel June 9. Included were picks for 
such non-Oscar categories as best villain ("The Good Son's" Macaulay Culkin, 
"In the Line of Fire's" John Malkovich, "The Crush's" Alicia Silverstone, 
"Demolition Man's" Wesley Snipes and "Jurassic Park's" T-Rex), and most 
desirable male and female (William Baldwin, Tom Cruise, Val Kilmer, Jean-Claude 
Van Damme and Denzel Washington; Kim Bassinger, Janet Jackson, Demi Moore, 
Alicia Silverstone and Sharon Stone). Viewers of the music video channel also 
voted on best song nominees, and in addition to Oscar- winner Bruce 
Springsteen's "Streets of Philadelphia" from "Philadelphia," chose Bryan Adams, 
Rod Stewart and Sting's "All for Love" from "The 3 Musketeers," UB40's "I Can't 
Help Falling in Love" from "Sliver," The Proclaimers' "I'm Gonna Be (500 
Miles)" from "Benny & Joon," Celine Dion and Clive Griffin's "When I Fall in 
Love" from "Sleepless in Seattle," and Michael Jackson's "Will You Be There" 
from "Free Willy." OPERA

 Bergonzi's American Farewell: Noted Italian opera star Carlo Bergonzi 
performed for two hours before a sell-out crowd at New York's Carnegie Hall 
Sunday night in what was billed as his American farewell concert. The crowd 
rewarded him with 40 minutes of cheering, including standing ovations and 
stamping feet, and prompted five encores from the 70-year-old tenor. Bergonzi 
made his Metropolitan Opera House debut as Radames in "Aida" in 1956 and was on 
the roster there for the last time in the 1988-89 season, singing Edgardo in 
"Lucia di Lammermoor." "Tonight is a very, very emotional night," Bergonzi said 
after the show. Through a translator, Bergonzi also hinted that he might agree 
to sing once again in appropriate benefit concerts.

 * Domingo Tickets Go to Romanian Brass: A concert by famed tenor Placido 
Domingo has set off a controversy in Romania, where local media are accusing 
President Ion Iliescu of hogging the tickets for bureaucratic brass and 
excluding local opera buffs. The artistic management company Artexim, which is 
co-organizing Tuesday's concert at Bucharest's Palace Hall, says the presidency 
has bought up nearly a third of 4,100 seats available, and that the rest are 
shared among the foreign and culture ministries, Romanian television, the state 
radio company and Bucharest's Opera house. Iliescu's cultural adviser admitted 
Monday that the president had booked "a number of tickets," but declined to say 
how many. State-owned Romanian Television, which is organizing the event with 
Artexim, said Monday: "We will pay Domingo's concert fee of $250,000 . . . and 
we will make up for Artexim's failure to put up tickets for sale at the box 
office through a live television broadcast of Domingo's concert." TELEVISION

 KCOP Cuts Back News Programming: After investing millions in new equipment and 
personnel on what it calls "Real News," KCOP Channel 13 has decided to scale 
back its news operation just 15 months after its debut, at least for now. This 
past weekend, the station eliminated its hourlong 10 p.m. Saturday and Sunday 
newscasts, and beginning May 16, will cut the 10 weekday newscasts to just half 
an hour. Station Manager Rick Feldman stressed Monday that KCOP is not cutting 
back its news budget and hopes to expand its news programming in the future. He 
expected no layoffs in the news staff in part because the station plans this 
summer to begin airing a different type of news show at 10:30 p.m. that devotes 
longer segments to current hot topics. Though Feldman said he is pleased with 
the walk-around style of the newscast that originates from all parts of KCOP's 
fancy new newsroom, he added that it was not enough of a distinction to draw 
viewers from the other three hourlong newscasts at 10 p.m. Switching to a 
half-hour will provide a real alternative for viewers at that hour, he said.

 * Talk, Talk, Talk: Ten of America's most opinionated TV talk personalities -- 
including Phil Donahue, Geraldo Rivera, Tom Snyder and Mary Matalin -- will 
swap ideas with viewers during "Talk Back America II," airing tonight at 6 on 
cable's CNBC. The two-hour special will invite viewer dialogue through an 800 
number. SHAUNA SNOW

DANCE REVIEW; OAKLAND TROUPE SHOWS VARIED SKILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Without ever looking distinguished in any one style, Oakland Ballet met a 
number of different challenges skillfully enough that sheer versatility 
sustained its program of Bay Area specialties, Sunday evening at Pepperdine 
University in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 To chamber music by Peter Sculthorpe, "Sightings" featured intriguing 
postmodern spatial/ sculptural gambits -- especially complex layers of action 
and passages in which some of the 13 dancers formed corridors and other 
architectural structures that shaped the movement options of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sightings" choreographers Margaret Jenkins and Ellie Klopp belong to the 
world of modern dance, but the Oakland ensemble seemed equally at home in that 
domain as in the style of whimsical, all-American contemporary ballet 
exemplified by company executive director Ron Thiele's "How'd They Catch Me?" 
Unfortunately, Thiele's suite of one-joke miniatures failed to match the wit 
and invention of its accompaniment: Stravinsky's "Two Suites for Small 
Orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
 For a character-dance showpiece, the company turned to Willam Christensen's 
1950 "Nothin' Doin' Bar" (music by Milhaud), a knockabout farce set in a 
Prohibition-era speak-easy. Dominated by pantomime, the work's chief dance 
opportunity turned out to be a tap solo for the elegant Joral Schmalle -- but 
everyone mustered conviction galore in a style foreign to today's dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 To those audiences who insist on tutus, toe shoes and the Imperial Russian 
tradition, Oakland Ballet offered a reconstruction by dance historian Frank W. 
D. Ries of a lost pas de deux danced by Anna Pavlova and Mikhail Mordkin in 
many versions starting in 1909 (the Ries edition is dated 1910, with 
choreography credited to Marius Petipa and Alexander Gorsky). 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, Abra Rudisill and Mario Alonzo couldn't match the star power of 
long-dead ballet icons, but their confident performance of intricate bravura 
choreography conveyed a greater sense of how Pavlova initially excited her 
public than the hyper-glamorous, off-speed silent films Pavlova made in the 
1920s. LEWIS SEGAL

 A dozen male voices strong and polished to a handsome gleam, the San 
Francisco-based vocal group Chanticleer knows its business. Textural purity and 
pristine execution are the hallmarks of the group, together since 1978, and 
they have helped advance the state of the vocal art. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the ensemble, which appeared Saturday in Irvine with a different 
program, came to the Wadsworth Theater on Sunday, it had less serious matters 
on the collective mind. A program bearing the heading "In the Madrigal 
Tradition" swerved freely from depth to froth, from the 16th Century to the 
late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Variety isn't always a good thing. The change of cultural altitude was a bit 
unsettling as the singers shifted from the deep, timeless glow of Monteverdi to 
Peter Schickele's "Go for Broke: A Comedy for Chorus." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After opening music by Palestrina, comprising randy biblical texts and 
beatific sonorities, Adriano Banchieri's "Festino" of 1608 was the concert's 
first romp, a madrigal comedy replete with animal noises and drunken reveling. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing the first half with this program's memorable highlight, Monteverdi's 
mournful "Lagrime d'amante al sepolcro dell'amata (sestina)," proved a model of 
fragile emotions and exquisite formal design. Unfortunately, the context didn't 
complement the sublimity very well. 
</P>
<P>
 For the contemporary works of the second half, the group's dress code 
lightened up, as the singers traded formal wear for white pants and colored 
coats. William Hawley's "Seven Madrigals," written in 1986, is an appealing 
enough work, in conservative, Renaissance-inflected tonal language. 
</P>
<P>
 They pulled out the stops, broke out the wardrobe and props, and generally put 
on the shtick for Schickele's silly little fable about a certain John Q. 
Public. Mr. Public's fate turns from golden -- winning the lottery -- to 
forlorn. The tax man cometh, then charitable causes, and then money-hungry 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Happy endings, however, haven't gone out of style here. Schickele has pieced 
the tale together with wink-wink cleverness on various levels. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a mixed bag of a show. But Chanticleer is plainly a group with an 
admirable mission and a well-honed ensemble voice, whether it's out to 
entertain or enlighten. JOSEF WOODARD

DANCE REVIEW; FLAMENCO WITH GRACE FROM LA TANIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID GERE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elegance is not a quality one generally looks for in Spanish flamenco. Nor is 
physical beauty a prerequisite of this Gypsy art form.But, in an appearance at 
the Fountain Theatre in Hollywood, Sunday night, the dancer La Tania made grace 
and beauty the defining features of a compelling Soleares. 
</P>
<P>
 In a silver-blue gown of simple cut, La Tania possesses all the regal bearing 
of a young Audrey Hepburn. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she begins to tug at the fabric swirling at her hips. Her twisting steps 
and carved gestures become fitful, almost erratic. A slight sheen of moisture 
dampens her furrowed brow. And she lets loose with a barrage of precision heel 
work: clean, furious, incessant, almost abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 La Tania's combination of restraint and release are capable of unleashing the 
extraordinary, revealing the strength and power of the training she received in 
Spain from a young age. But, at other times, she errs in the direction of 
composed severity. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Siguiriyas proves as straightforward and uncompromising as the razor-sharp 
part in her slicked-back hair. The steps seldom veer from the tried-and-true. 
The same can be said of the flirtatious Guajiras. And at a crucial moment in 
her heel work, she loses track of the off-beat and reverts to a model's pose. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus Montoya's whiskyed tenor serves as a wonderful foil to her physical 
polish. Guitarist Don Fontowitz paints a remarkable coloristic landscape in his 
Bulerias, with Montoya and fellow singer Jose Manuel Blanco providing clapping, 
finger-snapping, wood-slapping accompaniment. And, in a solo spot, guest dancer 
Cristian Almodovar delivers a Solea por Bulerias packed with eccentric steps. 
</P>
<P>
 * La Tania, presented at the Fountain Theatre, 5060 Fountain Ave., Hollywood. 
Remaining performances: Today, (with Roberto Amaral) and Wednesday, at 8 p.m. 
Tickets $17.50 at box office, (213) 663-1524. DAVID GERE

AL MARTINEZ: THE PINE TREES ON BELLA'S HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People in Boyle Heights call it Bella's Hill because Bella Corvera has lived 
on it for 30 years and has a kind of proprietary interest in what goes on 
around it or on top of it. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a small knoll just off Zonal Avenue and across from Hazard Park, maybe an 
acre of land right next to a covered water reservoir that's been there as long 
as anyone can remember. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the hill interesting is not exactly its location but the presence 
of about a hundred Canary Island pine trees that tower 60 to 80 feet over the 
neighborhood, trees so tall and stately you can see them from the San 
Bernardino Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Bella Corvera, who lives in a duplex right across an alley from the little 
plot of trees, has raised five of her kids there. They used to ride their bikes 
on trails that wind through the tiny forest, and camp at night on a soft bed of 
pine needles. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a mountain-like atmosphere to the grove, enhanced by a scent of pine 
that can take you drifting back to places in memory where you haven't been in 
years, family camping trips that were always chaotic and fun. 
</P>
<P>
 The trees were brought to Bella's Hill from their native Canary Islands in the 
late 1920s when they were hardly more than twigs. No one knows who brought 
them, just someone who loved trees. 
</P>
<P>
 They're a part of Bella's past, a small forest in the middle of a city that 
cries out for preservation. But soon, too soon, both Bella and a lot of her 
trees will be gone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They lie in the path of a billion-dollar expansion project of the County-USC 
Hospital, much of which was damaged by last January's earthquake. The reservoir 
and Bella's Hill are owned by the city's Department of Water and Power. They'll 
sell them to the county for the hospital expansion program. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no question that Bella's going to be forced to move. Hers is one of 
160 homes that will be flattened to make way for a 3,000-car parking structure. 
Cars always come first in a city which, if it isn't careful, will someday ride 
to hell atop a spontaneous combustion engine. 
</P>
<P>
 Bella cries when she talks about having to move. It will be the third time 
she's been forced from her home by County Hospital or USC Medical School 
expansion, either for a parking structure or for student dormitories. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time is the worse because she's been there longer and raised her 
family on the hilltop. And there are those trees, too, which will linger in 
memory as long as she lives, pointing timelessly toward heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the trees that got me involved in this. Alex Man, who lives in Santa 
Monica Canyon, called one day to say I ought to look into a proposed 
environmental disaster in East L.A. on a place called Bella's Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 He was aware of columns I'd written to help save Topanga's Summit Valley from 
the builders and pointed out that open space in Boyle Heights was every damned 
bit as important as open space on the tony Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 What intrigued me was that here was a guy who lived on the Westside too and 
was furious about what was happening on the eastg side of town. Turns out he's 
president of the Federation of Organizations for Conserving Urban Space, or 
FOCUS. They've already saved a couple of parks and don't want to see Bella's 
Hill and its trees die under a bulldozer's blade. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The covered reservoir is a goner for sure, but the fate of the trees is less 
clear. Plans now call for about 30 of them to be yanked out, and even though 
they're going to be replaced, that's not good enough for Man and for others who 
want to see the whole grove spared. 
</P>
<P>
 They claim that the work itself is going to be destructive to much more than 
30 of the pines, and the trees that replace them will be sticks compared to 
what's there now. 
</P>
<P>
 But even more important, they just don't trust builders to stay with the 
original plans. They see them as lovers of steel and concrete who would gladly 
rip out anything in their path for the sake of a building, trees be damned. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we want to do," Man says, "is save some open space in an area that has so 
little." 
</P>
<P>
 I understand that and wish sometimes that all the vacant lots of my past were 
still there, but they're not. The best we can hope for here is that the county 
will save most of those towering pines. 
</P>
<P>
 And what can we say of Bella Corvera, who is being forced to move from her 
beloved hill to make room for a temple to cars? Nothing, really, that will ever 
replace the whisper of a breeze rustling through high branches. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least I can offer the words of author James Barrie who said that God 
gave us memory so we would have roses in winter . . . and, perhaps, the sweet, 
lingering scent of pine when its memory is all we have left.

RELATIONSHIPS: SINGLES ORCHESTRATE LESSONS IN ART OF MINGLING; SOPHISTICATES 
ARE DRAWN TO THE NON-THREATENING SOCIAL GROUPS OF ORANGE COUNTY'S CULTURAL 
ORGANIZATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you happen to wander into a party before a Pacific Symphony concert at the 
Westin South Coast Plaza hotel and hear that old conversational chestnut 
"What's your sign?" don't be surprised if the next words you hear are " Da 
capo. " 
</P>
<P>
 Not that everybody in the room will be up on musical nomenclature, but the 
singles that gather periodically at the hotel for preconcert food, drink and 
talk aren't your typical singles bar crawlers. They want a little culture with 
their courting, a bit of Romantic music with their romantic overtures. 
</P>
<P>
 And the numbers of these people appear to be growing as the appeal of singles 
groups that are associated with Orange County arts and cultural organizations 
grows. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't the heavy emphasis on socializing, so you don't feel 
intimidated," said Ellen Dunn, 41, who is a subscriber to the Pacific Symphony 
Classic Encounters' concert series for singles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go to have a good time and to hear a good concert, and not necessarily to 
meet someone," she said. "It seemed more select than some of the other things 
that are out there. I don't like bars, and I don't like loud music; plus some 
of the other activities tend to be heavily involved in drinking. This is not. 
It's much more sophisticated than many of the other things out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the opening of the Orange County Performing Arts Center and the 
attendant growth spurt of many musical, cultural and artistic organizations in 
the county, these groups have found that targeting the large local single 
population can pay dividends that are at once social, artistic and, in some 
cases, monetary. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the single people who have become actively involved with these groups, 
many say that they have found a less intimidating, less structured, more 
intellectual and more artistically rewarding way to spend their time and money 
than the more usual round of singles parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good combination," said Buck Buchhagen, chairman of Classic 
Encounters. "Single people are always looking for new and different avenues to 
meet people, and the majority of our people are truly interested in classical 
music. I don't want to sound elitist, but I think we attract people who have 
both a love of music and who would like to find someone to get into a 
relationship with." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there appears to be far less of the intense sort of male-female 
socializing that can be characteristic of other singles organizations. Members 
of most arts/singles groups say that the idea of romance is fairly low on their 
agenda when they attend an event. They're there for good food, good 
conversation with other arts fans and, in the shank of the evening, a cultural 
experience. Actual pairings and romances occur, but they are few. The nature of 
the groups is more communal than individual. 
</P>
<P>
 Most artistic singles organizations' activities revolve around periodic social 
gatherings, such as preconcert parties, post-opera receptions or seasonal theme 
parties. However, nearly every group, to some extent, serves as a source of 
income for its parent artistic organization, whether through the purchase of 
tickets or through fund-raising activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Performing Arts Center, for instance, has two guild chapters -- the 
Cabaret Chapter and the Bogart and Bacall Chapter -- that are designed for 
singles of different age groups and that devote their efforts primarily to fund 
raising. Still, said Bogart and Bacall's incoming co-chairwoman, the social 
side can't be neglected. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got into the chapter last February, I'd just come to Orange County 
from Riverside, and I hadn't really thought about whether I wanted to get into 
the arts or not," said Debra Henderson, 41, a buyer for a medical company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just knew that I wanted something that wasn't the typical dating scene, 
something that was a place to gather whether you were male or female. And I've 
enjoyed it a great deal. But now we're gearing things more toward a social 
atmosphere," she said. "Before, it was more meetings and fund raising. That's 
the goal of the group, but you have to make it fun in order to get people 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the group has organized swing dance lessons, a car rally and a New 
Year's Eve party as well as fund-raising parties, said outgoing chairwoman 
Patricia Migatulski. 
</P>
<P>
 "People meet other quality people through the group," she said. "And because 
this is a volunteer group, the people are givers, and everyone knows that." 
</P>
<P>
 They also are mostly female, a fact possibly explained by the nature of the 
cultural activities around which the groups revolve. Several women said that 
the opportunity to attend artistic and cultural events was the main reason they 
joined. 
</P>
<P>
 Some men said this, too, but the male-to-female ratio of the Bogart and Bacall 
chapter is two men to every three women (the Cabaret chapter of the Performing 
Arts Center guilds, which is designed for singles 30 to 55, has a similar 
ratio). 
</P>
<P>
 Other artistic/social groups in the county are not specifically designed for 
singles but seem to attract a large singles following nonetheless. The Bohemian 
Guild, a group attached to Opera Pacific, has a high singles membership -- the 
result, said the group's chairman Rudy Lukes, of a specific attempt to attract 
young single professionals.  
</P>
<P>
 However, not unlike other singles/arts groups, the Bohemian Guild has many 
members, according to Lukes, who began their involvement with little knowledge 
of music in general or opera in particular. The social life drew them in, and, 
in many cases, the artistic exposure held their interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The participation was a turning point for some people who you couldn't pay to 
see an opera before," Lukes said. 
</P>
<P>
 One opera convert is Nigel Wager, a graphics system consultant from Laguna 
Beach who says he is "around 30." His involvement with the Bohemian Guild 
began, he said, when he met Lukes in a Laguna Beach bakery and began discussing 
an opera poster that had hung in the bakery window and which the baker had 
given to Wager. Lukes talked him into joining on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fun group," Wager said. "We do dinners, movies and have regular nights 
after the opera at a restaurant when we'll bring in some of the cast and get a 
chance to meet and talk to them. My involvement with opera has become greater 
and greater, and I meet lots of people. There's no question that it's a good 
social outlet. The main thing is that it's a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Wager, like other members of arts/singles groups, said that romance is not 
necessarily a key element of the groups' programs, but friendships and the 
occasional romantic relationship do blossom. The often elegant surroundings at 
group events can nudge things along. 
</P>
<P>
 At events sponsored by Toccata, a 2-year-old social group affiliated with the 
Orange County Philharmonic Society, the socializing goes on at post-concert 
receptions at area restaurants, where fine dinners are provided for members. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not promoted as a singles group, but we tend to attract young people 
who are single, as well as couples," said group chairman Lou Miraula. "We're 
not in the fund-raising business per se. What binds us together is our common 
interest in, primarily, classical music, but also in nice food and wines. We 
also have what we call 'music tastings,' which are events where musicians are 
invited to play and talk about their music. It's kind of like Music 101." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar education is the primary emphasis of Bowers Singles for the Cultural 
Arts, a group of singles primarily in their 40s and 50s who meet monthly at 
Bowers Museum in Santa Ana for lectures or other artistic programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I became single, I was looking for people with interests similar to 
mine," said Julia Blakesley, a retired teacher from Fullerton. "And the group 
had a marvelous variety of topics that cover all the arts. It's a way to 
socialize with people who are talking about art and to have an interchange with 
a knowledgeable speaker." 
</P>
<P>
 The atmosphere is less festive than most of the performing arts singles 
groups, but relationships are formed, Blakesley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people (in the group) who I know of who have become couples or have 
become fairly committed to one another," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the byword for the artistic singles groups may be social rather than 
romantic. Again and again, members of the groups expressed an appreciation for 
the nature of the gatherings ("non-threatening" was used as a description in 
several cases) and for the sense of elegance and culture that was part of most 
evenings. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that things get mired in heavy artistic conversation. A good number of 
people at, for instance, Classic Encounters parties "may not know Beethoven 
from a loaf of bread," said Buchhagen, but they do enjoy a good jaw over drinks 
and appetizers. 
</P>
<P>
 To push that along a bit, said Buchhagen, "icebreaker games" are always 
offered at each event, in which members are issued slips of paper with, say, 
the name of a composer and are charged with finding the person in the room with 
the name of a corresponding musical composition. The search can take them 
through several conversational groups. 
</P>
<P>
 If that seems a bit juvenile, Buchhagen said, people don't seem to care. In 
fact, he said, when the games were omitted at one event, "several people asked 
me what happened to them. They wanted them back." 
</P>
<P>
 "The atmosphere is like a cocktail party," said Gil Mahlmeister, 45, of the 
preconcert gatherings sponsored by Classic Encounters. "You have a lot of 
opportunities just to walk around and meet people, and everybody's there to be 
social. I've met a lot of nice people and made a lot of friends, but so far 
nothing serious or special. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm primarily interested in the music, and my secondary goal is to meet women 
who have the same interests and values as I do," he said. "The way I see it is, 
what type of person is going to like this type of music?"

DODGERS WONDER WHO'S ON SECOND; BASEBALL: INFIELD FOUL-UP IN NINTH HELPS 
PHILLIES GAIN 5-4 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 When the game was over Monday night, Eric Karros was left sprawled on the 
ground near first base, his foot still stretched to the bag. Gary Wayne, who 
just experienced another disaster, stood nearby in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 And later in an already quiet clubhouse, Jose Offerman refused to explain why 
he failed to cover second base on a double-play ball, a gaffe that helped the 
Philadelphia Phillies to a 5-4 victory at Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have anything to say," Offerman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a season in which the Dodgers seem to communicate well only when they score 
19 runs, they experienced yet another breakdown, this one coming in the ninth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 4-4, and Wayne pitching, John Kruk led off with a single 
to center. Wayne conferred with Offerman and second baseman Delino DeShields. 
It was decided that if Dave Hollins, the next batter, hit the ball to Wayne, 
Offerman would cover the bag for the double play. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Wayne turned to face Hollins, Offerman picked up the pitch sign from 
Mike Piazza. Because Piazza had called for an off-speed pitch, Offerman thought 
Hollins might pull the ball, and he shifted toward third base. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne didn't know Offerman had shifted, and when Hollins hit a bouncer back to 
the mound, Wayne turned to make the throw to second. 
</P>
<P>
 "I picked up Offy right away so I (threw the ball) to lead him as he was 
running for the bag," Wayne said.  
</P>
<P>
 DeShields broke toward the middle when the ball was hit, and when he saw that 
Offerman wasn't covering the base, he lunged across the bag to make the catch, 
but the throw, obviously wide, pulled him off the bag and Kruk and Hollins were 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was anybody else there?" asked DeShields, who said he didn't know Offerman 
had shifted. "My momentum took me right there and I took over the situation.  
</P>
<P>
 "When we establish the coverage, it doesn't change." 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Daulton grounded into a double play, which moved Kruk, who represented 
the winning run, to third. Jim Eisenreich followed with a soft liner off the 
side of the mound that Wayne (0-2) lunged for but missed by inches. DeShields 
charged it, and made the throw to Karros. 
</P>
<P>
 Karros stretched as much as he could to make the catch, but Eisenreich barely 
beat the throw. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a lucky hit," Eisenreich said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone can talk about what happened at the end, but it never should have 
come to that in the first place," Karros said. "We had our chances." 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies took a 3-0 lead after the third inning off starter Ramon 
Martinez. Cory Snyder scored in the fourth inning on a single by Offerman.  
</P>
<P>
 Then in the seventh, Offerman walked and Dave Hansen doubled to move Offerman 
to third. 
</P>
<P>
 David West, a left-hander, relieved starter Ben Rivera and got two outs before 
facing Piazza. The count was 2-1 when West came back with a fastball down the 
middle for a called strike. Then West threw a fastball outside, and Piazza hit 
it off the barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 There was so much hang time nobody was sure where it would land. But the ball 
carried down the line about 330 feet and dropped behind the wall into the 
Phillies' bullpen, putting the Dodgers ahead, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I got under it too much and he would be right there," said Piazza, 
who was two for four and is batting .370 (10 for 27) in the past seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lead didn't last long. In the seventh, Jim Gott, who relieved 
Martinez, gave up consecutive singles to Daulton and Eisenreich with two outs. 
Milt Thompson hit a shot down the left-field line that bounced past third base 
and caromed off the wall, scoring Daulton to make it 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "When have you seen a left-handed hitter hit it over the third-base bag?" 
Manager Tom Lasorda asked. "That's the way things are going."

THIS LITTLE MAN IS THINKING BIG; BASKETBALL: NEW MEXICO POINT GUARD GREG BROWN, 
AT 5-7, WANTS A SHOT AT THE NBA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When New Mexico point guard Greg Brown heard he had won the Frances Pomeroy 
Naismith Award, friends and relatives were thrilled. Now he's waiting to see 
what pro coaches and scouts think. 
</P>
<P>
 Lobos coach Dave Bliss said capturing the Naismith, which honors the 
outstanding men's college basketball senior under 6-feet and women's player 
under 5-foot-6, strengthens Brown's hopes for a pro basketball career. 
</P>
<P>
 When a reporter asked Brown, who also was named Western Athletic Conference 
player of the year, what the latest honor might do for his potential pro 
career, Bliss interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Questions like that you answer 'it can't hurt,"' Bliss said. "I'm not sure 
you ever know an answer to something like that. The thing that will be possible 
for Greg is that he's going to get a tryout. That'll be fun. But if he does 
nothing else in basketball, he's had a phenomenal career." 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-7 guard averaged 19.3 points a game in leading the Lobos to their 
first regular-season WAC title in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he celebrated the award in his typical, low-key fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called some friends, called my mom and dad and went to class," he said. "I 
was excited to tell them because I knew they would probably get more emotional 
than I was." 
</P>
<P>
 The award comes five weeks after the close of a season in which Brown scored 
at least 25 points seven times and become only the sixth Lobo to score 40 or 
more in a game -- he scored 42 against Texas-El Paso on Feb. 5. The Lobos went 
23-8, losing 57-54 to Virginia in the NCAA West Region's first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's closest competitor for the award was Doremus Bennerman of Siena, who 
averaged 26 points a game -- but did it playing in the smaller Metro Atlantic 
Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Bliss said Air Force coach Reggie Minton, who is on the award selection 
committee, told him about two weeks ago that the honor was Brown's. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said it was a slam dunk," Bliss said. "I know Bennerman had a fine year, 
but I think the people on the committee, which included people (coaches) who 
had played against Greg, felt strongly that Greg had done it at a major college 
level in a major conference." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown had a sterling high school career at Albuquerque High, leading the 
Bulldogs to the 1990 state championship with a 30-point effort against 
Albuquerque La Cueva. 
</P>
<P>
 But he went unnoticed by Division I recruiters and attended New Mexico Junior 
College in Hobbs for two seasons. There, he caught Bliss' eye by averaging 18.5 
points and almost nine assists per game. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown moved into the Lobos' starting lineup early in the 1992-93 season and 
averaged 30-plus minutes throughout the rest of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a coach, I have never compromised more of my offensive principles than 
while coaching Greg Brown," Bliss said. "Because his best play is to dribble 
down the court and shoot it. Everybody knows that's not a great basketball 
play, but for us it was terrific." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown will receive the award May 7 as part of the Basketball Hall of Fame's 
enshrinement weekend in Springfield, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is the second New Mexico native to win a Naismith award. Clovis High 
School graduate Bubba Jennings won the award in 1985 while with Texas Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 While Brown is the first Lobo to win the award, New Mexico universities have 
now won back-to-back Naismiths. Last year, 5-foot-8 guard Sam Crawford won it 
with New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
 In the recently completed Continental Basketball Association season, Crawford 
averaged 11.4 points and 8.1 assists with two teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Frances Pomeroy Naismith was the daughter-in-law of basketball creator James 
Naismith. Her family put up the money to sponsor the award, which goes to 
players who also demonstrate leadership, character and loyalty off court. 
</P>
<P>
 The first man to win the award was Purdue's William Keller in 1969. Some other 
notable winners have been Tyrone Bogues of Wake Forest and Tim Hardaway of 
Texas-El Paso.

NBA ROUNDUP; BULLS' RESERVES ARE SWEET IN VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When a crucial victory over the Atlanta Hawks was about to slip away, 
Chicago's reserves came through. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the biggest victory of the season," said Steve Kerr, who made two key 
three-point baskets after the Bulls squandered a 22-point lead at Chicago and 
then regrouped for an 87-70 victory on Monday that moved them within a 
half-game of Atlanta in the race for the Eastern Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta, after withstanding a 17-0 run by the Bulls in the first half, put 
together a 24-5 spurt bridging the second and third quarters and gained a 51-51 
tie with 4:39 left in the third on Mookie Blaylock's three-point basket. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bulls, who went nearly nine minutes without a basket, rallied as Kerr 
made a pair of three-point shots and Toni Kukoc a pair of driving baskets in a 
12-2 run that helped Chicago rebuild its lead to 63-55  
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 106, Dallas 97 -- Charles Barkley scored 28 points at Dallas as the 
Suns tied San Antonio for the third-best record in the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns (53-26), who have three games remaining, hold the tiebreaker edge 
over the Spurs because they won the season series, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix held a 90-87 lead before Barkley made a pair of free throws and a 
16-foot turnaround jumper from the left corner with 3:11 to play to make it 
94-87. Kevin Johnson had 21 points and 14 assists for the Suns.

 Quarterback Troy Aikman of the Dallas Cowboys apparently has frozen out Nancy 
Kerrigan after being teased mercilessly for reportedly sending the Olympic 
figure skater a letter in Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 "While appearing at an Atlanta mall," Esquire magazine reported, "Aikman 
insisted he hadn't sent the letter and that Kerrigan wasn't even 'my type.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Just then, Miss Hawaiian Tropic 1993 came over. 'Now, she's my type,' he 
whispered to a friend. Perhaps this explains why Miss Coppertone was recently 
seen wielding a lead pipe."

 Reality bites: On a recent episode of "Beverly Hills, 90210," Steve Sanders 
(Ian Ziering) was upset that car troubles caused him to miss the first three 
innings of the Dodgers' opener. By the time he got there, he complained, the 
Dodgers held a 6-0 lead. 
</P>

 These fictional Dodgers apparently are more potent than their real-life 
counterparts, who scored seven runs in their first four games, twice being shut 
out.

 Good point: From the Sporting News: "For Jim Rome's sake, it's a good thing he 
didn't tell Chris Evert she played like Jimmie Everett. There was never a 
tougher pro athlete than the queen o' the baseline."

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; LATE GOAL LIFTS SHARKS PAST RED WINGS, 5-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was San Jose's first playoff game, while the Detroit Red Wings, one of the 
NHL's original six, were making their 43rd postseason appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 But the night belonged to the Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 A goal by Vlastimil Kroupa at 15:36 of the third period gave the Sharks a 5-4 
victory over the Red Wings at Detroit on Monday night in their first-round 
Western Conference series. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody in our dressing room thought it would be a four-game series," 
Detroit's Dino Ciccarelli said. "We're faced with a little adversity now. But 
we expect it will be a long series." 
</P>
<P>
 Kroupa, on a feed from Todd Elik, wristed a shot from the right circle under 
the glove of Bob Essensa for the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sharks, who had never won on Detroit ice, took a 3-0 first-period lead, 
including Shawn Cronin's first goal in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Rangers 6, New York Islanders 0 -- Mike Richter turned in his second 
consecutive shutout and the Rangers, in virtually a copy of Game 1, scored four 
goals in the second period at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers got started quickly against rookie goalie Jamie McLennan, who held 
them scoreless for 67:22 in two relief appearances this season. McLennan, who 
had stopped 33 consecutive shots in the previous two games against the Rangers, 
gave up a goal to Alexei Kovalev on the first shot he faced. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver 5, Calgary 0 -- Goaltender Kirk McLean stopped 31 shots at Calgary 
as the Canucks took a 1-0 lead in their playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
 Trevor Linden, with his first goal in 10 games, Geoff Courtnall, Cliff 
Ronning, Jeff Brown and Dave Babych scored as Vancouver, heavy underdogs to the 
Pacific Division champion Flames, added to Calgary's playoff nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flames haven't won a playoff series since their 1989 Stanley Cup 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third playoff shutout of McLean's career. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 5, Chicago 1 -- Wendel Clark, Doug Gilmour, Kent Manderville, Jamie 
Macoun and Dave Andreychuk scored in the first 27 minutes against goaltender Ed 
Belfour as the Maple Leafs took a 1-0 lead in the Western Conference playoff 
series by winning at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Chelios scored Chicago's only goal in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 3, Boston 2 -- Paul Dipietro and Kirk Muller scored early in the 
third period and Patrick Roy made 40 saves at Boston as the Canadiens evened 
their playoff series at one game apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Muller gave the Canadiens a 3-2 lead with 4:32 gone in the period with his 
second goal of the game. Then Roy took over. His best save came with 3:09 
remaining when he gloved a 25-foot Ray Bourque slap shot that was headed for 
the corner of the net.

NHL PLAYOFFS; PENGUINS NOT PANICKING AFTER ONE DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pittsburgh Penguins knew exactly what the Washington Capitals would do -- 
pressure them, agitate them, irritate them. What they didn't count on was the 
Capitals beating them. 
</P>
<P>
 Capitals coach Jim Schoenfeld called it "abrasive, aggressive hockey" -- 
taking chances but not taking penalties, perplexing the talented Penguins 
without provoking them. It worked even better than planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Using some of the same tactics employed by the New York Islanders to eliminate 
the Penguins from the Stanley Cup playoffs last May, the Capitals beat 
Pittsburgh 5-3 on Sunday night in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference 
quarterfinals. Game 2 is Tuesday night at the Civic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Capitals' game plan -- Schoenfeld openly revealed it -- was to chase down 
the loose pucks, match aggressive defender Kevin Hatcher against the Penguins' 
top line, limit Pittsburgh's breakout passes from the neutral zone and be 
physically aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Lemieux scored twice, but the Capitals dictated the tempo to beat 
Pittsburgh in a playoff series opener for the third time in four years. The 
Penguins rebounded from Game 1 losses to Washington in 1991 and 1992 to win two 
Stanley Cups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's hope that holds up, right?" Penguins coach Eddie Johnston. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the home-ice loss puts the Penguins on the defensive -- and at a 
disadvantage -- unexpectedly early in the first-round series. And it did 
nothing to dispel their image of a team that needs a significant motivational 
challenge to get excited about the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the Rangers or the Canadiens, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we know the Penguins pretty well, and we know their tendencies," said 
goaltender Don Beaupre, who stopped 27 of 30 shots. "They have a lot of 
individuals who can step up and win games, and we've got to play our system and 
we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Lemieux and Joey Mullen scored in a span of 2:04 to put Pittsburgh up 2-1 in 
the first period, and the Penguins were probably only one more goal from 
forcing the Capitals out of their conservative but not passive style. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's human nature to kind of look at the Penguins in awe a bit, and I think 
our guys may have been in awe in the first period," said Schoenfeld, 20-12-6 
since replacing Terry Murray at midseason. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew it would take a real commitment, and we got that commitment. Kevin 
Hatcher looked like I could have left him on the ice all night," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Bondra and Mike Ridley restored the Capitals' one-goal lead by scoring 
2:22 apart in the second period, and the Penguins were held scoreless until 
Lemieux scored his second of the game with 44 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Juneau had put Washington up 4-2 at 10:34 of the third, beating goaltender 
Tom Barrasso on a breakaway after defensemen Ulf Samuelsson and Larry Murphy 
collided at mid-ice on a shift change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guys were very alert all night because we were making changes on the fly 
to get the matchups we wanted," said Schoenfeld, 20-12-6 since replacing Terry 
Murray at midseason. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, the Penguins found themselves explaining why they looked so 
disinterested against a team they were supposed to beat. 
</P>
<P>
 "They won on the intangibles," winger Rick Tocchet said. "We're professionals 
and we should have been ready to play but ..." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were flat ... we didn't have the intensity we should have had," Lemieux 
said. "This is playoff hockey, and we're going to have to fight through it." 
</P>
<P>
 At times, the Penguins seemed less motivated than their fans. For the first 
time since a 1982 series against the Islanders, the Penguins didn't sell out a 
home playoff game. Of course, the $68 ticket price -- up $21 from the regular 
season -- didn't help, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no time to panic -- yet," Samuelsson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't say when it would be time to panic, but a loss in Game 2 would 
probably would be a good starting point -- after all, the Capitals are 3-0-1 in 
their last four against Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Penguins. however, aren't talking like a team with intentions of going to 
Washington down 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had our wakeup call," Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd better not start celebrating too early," winger Kevin Stevens said. 
"They've still got to win three. ... And we've still got to win four."

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; FEDOROV SHOULD BE AT TOP OF AWARDS LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who should win the NHL's regular-season awards? 
</P>
<P>
 Glad you asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart (most valuable player): Sergei Fedorov. The Russian center carried the 
Detroit Red Wings while Steve Yzerman was injured and finished with a 
career-high 56 goals and 120 points. Runners-up: the New York Rangers' Adam 
Graves, for his 52 goals; Chicago center Jeremy Roenick, for his third 
consecutive 100-point season; goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck, who gave the 
Florida Panthers instant credibility and kept their playoff bid alive until 
their offense disappeared down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Calder (rookie of the year): Playing perhaps the toughest position for a 
rookie, New Jersey goalie Martin Brodeur finished with a 2.40 goals-against 
average and a .915 save mark. Runners-up: Alexei Yashin, who amassed 30 goals 
and 79 points for the dreadful Ottawa Senators; Mikael Renberg of the 
Philadelphia Flyers, who led rookies with 82 points, and 33-goal scorer Jason 
Arnott of Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
 Vezina (best goalie): Dominik Hasek of Buffalo. Runners-up: Mike Richter of 
the Rangers and Ed Belfour of the Blackhawks. Hasek's 1.95 average was the 
NHL's best in 20 years and he led the league with a .930 save percentage. 
Richter plays behind a good defense, but his 2.57 average was no fluke. 
Belfour, a workhorse, had a 2.67 average in 69 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Norris (best defenseman): Let's keep the defense in defenseman and pick the 
New Jersey Devils' Scott Stevens. A leader and a physical presence, he had a 
league-high plus-51 rating and was one of two defensemen to lead his team in 
scoring -- the Rangers' Sergei Zubov was the other. Runners-up: Boston's Ray 
Bourque, still peerless at directing the power play, and Toronto's defensive 
corps. Ordinary individually, they're formidable as a unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams (coach of the year): Mike Keenan's Rangers had a league-best 112 points, 
but Jacques Lemaire had less talent to work with in New Jersey and earned a 
franchise-record 106 points. Runners-up: Keenan; Buffalo's John Muckler, for 
devising a superb defensive system; Kevin Constantine, who led the San Jose 
Sharks to a record 58-point improvement, and the Mighty Ducks' Ron Wilson for 
squeezing the most out of a motley crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Masterton (perseverance and dedication): Bruin right wing Cam Neely. He has 
had almost as many knee injuries as he had goals, 50, this season yet never 
quit. Runners-up: Randy Burridge, who returned from surgery on both knees and 
scored 25 goals for Washington, and Toronto's Wendel Clark, who overcame 
lingering back injuries in scoring a career-high 46 goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Lady Byng (sportsmanship) -- Detroit right wing Ray Sheppard, who had 50 goals 
in 82 games and only 26 penalty minutes. Runner-up: Bob Kudelski of Florida, 
who had 30 goals, 70 points and only 24 penalty minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Selke (defensive forward) -- Fedorov is a reasonable choice. So is Brian 
Skrudlund, whose experience was vital to the expansion Panthers. AWARDS WE'D 
LIKE TO SEE 
</P>
<P>
 General manager of the year -- The Rangers' Neil Smith. He drafted Zubov, 
Sergei Nemchinov and Alexei Kovalev, acquired goalie Glenn Healy for a draft 
pick, saw free-agent signee Graves blossom into a dangerous scorer and added 
depth with a flurry of deadline-beating deals. Runner-up: Glen Sather, whose 
Oilers missed the playoffs but will be heard from soon. He stockpiled young 
talent and fleeced Winnipeg in the Dave Manson trade to get the fourth draft 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Minus -- There's an award for the best plus-minus, so why not one for the 
worst? The prize could be a neck brace. Ottawa's Gord Dineen might need one 
after constantly swiveling his head to watch opponents skate past him. He wound 
up with a minus-52 rating. 
</P>
<P>
 Flop of the year: Alexandre Daigle. Ottawa is paying him $12.5 million over 
five years for 20 goals and a minus-45 defensive rating? 
</P>
<P>
 Look us over award -- For the overlooked. To Dallas' Dave Gagner, a diligent 
two-way center who had 32 goals, and Buffalo's Dale Hawerchuk. Without his 86 
points, the Sabres would be on vacation. A FEW OF OUR FAVORITE THINGS 
</P>
<P>
 What we love about the playoffs: 
</P>
<P>
 The unlikely heroes -- Until Sunday, Darcy Wakaluk's claim to fame was being 
the first American Hockey League goalie to score a goal. Then Dallas Coach Bob 
Gainey chose Wakaluk to start against St. Louis instead of Andy Moog, who won 
three Stanley Cup championships with Edmonton and leads active goalies in 
winning percentage and victories. Wakaluk stopped 33 shots in a victory that 
preserved the Stars' home-ice advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 The secrecy -- Was it an old wrist problem that kept Yzerman out of Detroit's 
opener against San Jose on Monday? Another knee injury? Or the neck problems 
that idled him early this season? 
</P>
<P>
 Yzerman said he wasn't allowed to talk and Coach Scotty Bowman probably 
wouldn't confirm that Yzerman even exists if asked under duress. SOBERING 
THOUGHTS 
</P>
<P>
 In the last month, six Hartford Whaler players were involved in a barroom 
brawl, General Manager Paul Holmgren was arrested for drunken driving and 
entered the Betty Ford Clinic for treatment, and defenseman Bryan Marchment was 
arrested for drunken driving on the way home from a charity event. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Wings suspect that Bob Probert, who has undergone alcohol treatment 
three times, is drinking again. He denies having a problem. Early this season, 
Pittsburgh General Manager Craig Patrick was arrested for driving under the 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
 And still the NHL has no alcohol- or drug-rehabilitation policy. 
</P>
<P>
 A drinking-drug abuse program such as the NBA's has been discussed during 
collective bargaining talks, but because there's no agreement, there's no 
policy. Will it take an alcohol-related driving death to get a program going? 
SLAP SHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 Those close to the Nordiques say that Pierre Page, vilified by Quebec fans for 
missing the playoffs, will return as general manager but might give up 
coaching. Marcel Aubut will probably stay as team president. . . . The 
Pittsburgh Penguins won't increase ticket prices next season and will cut some. 
They had 11 sellouts and averaged 16,714 in the 17,537-seat Civic Arena this 
season. They didn't sell out their playoff opener Sunday, their first 
postseason non-sellout since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's Sunday playoff telecasts averaged a 2.6 rating and an 8 share, "not a 
bad number," a network spokesman said. Each rating point equals 941,000 homes. 
Regular-season games averaged ratings of 1.6, 2.0 and 2.4 and shares of 4, 7 
and 6, respectively. . . . If Tampa Bay General Manager Phil Esposito goes to 
ESPN, he's leaving before the club's owners push him out. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Flyers complained that Coach Terry Simpson ran harsh practices and didn't 
punish stars for mistakes that got others benched. Said the team's biggest 
star, Eric Lindros: "If we went out there and did what Terry told us to do, 
things would have been a lot better for the team. I don't think you can blame 
the coach at all." Owner Ed Snider gave General Manager Russ Farwell a vote of 
confidence, which also covers Simpson.

<P>
 Chan Ho Park will be a great story some day, but the first few chapters 
shouldn't be rushed. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He needs seasoning in the minor leagues. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I still don't understand the baseball schedule maker. Both local ballparks 
will be empty today, the Dodgers and Angels being engaged in the East. . . . 
Firing Manager Jim Lefebvre sure has turned the Chicago Cubs around. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The question is not whether the Atlanta Braves' Greg Maddux will win 20 games 
this season, but whether he will become the first pitcher since Denny McLain in 
1968 to win 30. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Sunday averages showed 11 American League teams with earned-run averages 
of at least 4.55. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Among the surprises Sunday in Pittsburgh was that the Dodgers' 19-2 beating of 
the Pirates lasted only 2 hours 57 minutes. That night, the Baltimore Orioles' 
6-5 victory over the Texas Rangers took 4 hours 4 minutes. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Ballpark in Arlington, Tex., is nice, but I can't figure out if it wants 
to be Royals Stadium, Camden Yards or Tiger Stadium. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 No less an authority than Vin Scully says rookie Raul Mondesi has the best 
throwing arm of any Dodger since Carl Furillo. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Furillo and Roberto Clemente occasionally threw out runners who had lined 
balls into shallow right field. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 University of Pennsylvania freshman catcher Kevin O'Malley is the son of 
Dodger President Peter O'Malley. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 One of the top collegiate prospects is Southern Mississippi infielder Tommy 
Davis, who is no relation to the former Dodger. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers will be saluted by the L.A. Area Chamber of Commerce and L.A. 
Sports Council at a luncheon Thursday at the Westin Bonaventure. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Angels made a sound move when they hired Tom Romenesko, former farm 
director for the San Diego Padres, as special-assignment scout. . . .

<P>
 I can see Juwan Howard being effective in the NBA next season, but not his 
fellow Michigan undergraduate, Jalen Rose. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The New York Giants might take San Diego State wide receiver Darnay Scott in 
the first round of the draft Sunday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Look-alikes: Troy Aikman and a young Mickey Mantle. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Add look-alikes: Former USC Coach Larry Smith and an older Mickey Mantle. . .

</P>
<P>
 L.A.-Anaheim is without a team in the NBA or NHL playoffs, but all five New 
York-New Jersey teams qualified -- the Knicks, Nets, Rangers, Devils and 
Islanders. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 They ought to name a boulevard for Al Unser Jr. in downtown Long Beach. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Lukas visited the Santa Anita stable area Sunday for the first time since 
being run down Dec. 15 by Kentucky Derby contender Tabasco Cat. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Chris Antley, who has 62 victories and 39 second-place finishes during the 
Santa Anita meeting, doesn't lose many photo finishes. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The handicap division might bounce back at Hollywood Park.Breeders' Cup 
Classic surprise Arcangues is due to return for the John Henry Handicap on May 
1 and The Wicked North is penciled in for three stakes, among them the 
Hollywood Gold Cup on July 2. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Jackie McCoy's unbeaten Carlos (Famous) Hernandez has signed a promotional 
contract with the Forum, where he will fight Narciso Valenzuela next Monday on 
the undercard to Julio Cesar Borboa's defense of the International Boxing 
Federation super-flyweight title against Jorge Luis Roman. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the 10th anniversary of the 1984 Olympic Games in L.A. approaches, it is 
remarkable how many participants in the boxing competition became important pro 
fighters. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Among them are Evander Holyfield, Pernell Whitaker, Lennox Lewis, Meldrick 
Taylor, Virgil Hill, Frank Tate, Mark Breland, Jeff Fenech, Paul Gonzales, 
Henry Tillman, Tyrell Biggs, Francesco Damiani and Hector Lopez. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Lewis of Canada and Fenech of Australia didn't even win medals in '84. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield, who will defend his heavyweight title against Michael Moorer on 
Friday at Caesars Palace, was limited to a bronze medal in the 
light-heavyweight division because of a controversial disqualification in the 
semifinal match against Kevin Barry of New Zealand. . . . Lopez, who will fight 
Rod Sequenan on Saturday at the Olympic, attended Glendale Hoover High, but 
represented Mexico and lost the bantamweight gold medal match to Maurizio 
Stecca of Italy. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Somebody should tell Carl Lewis, who is in his 15th season as a world-class 
performer and is aiming for the 1996 Olympic Games, that sprinters aren't 
supposed to have long careers.

BASEBALL ROUNDUP; RAINES POURS ON THE POWER TO LEAD WHITE SOX TO VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Tim Raines trotted to the dugout after his third home run of the game, 
Frank Thomas vowed to hit a homer just to make sure Raines didn't get too 
cocky. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him I've got to hit a homer the last time up or else he would talk all 
day," said Thomas, who backed up his promise two batters later as the Chicago 
White Sox routed the Boston Red Sox, 12-1, Monday at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Raines hit solo homers leading off the first and third innings and a two-run 
drive in the eighth. He also walked, singled and reached on an error in the 
ninth. Raines scored five runs and drove in four. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first three-homer game of Raines' career. All three were hit to 
right field, helped by a 12-m.p.h. wind. 
</P>
<P>
 The power display by the White Sox, who also got a three-run triple from Joey 
Cora, overshadowed Wilson Alvarez taking a no-hit bid into the sixth inning and 
winning his 11th consecutive decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez (3-0) hasn't lost since last Aug. 11. He won his final seven decisions 
last season, defeated Toronto in the playoffs and has given up only five earned 
runs in three starts this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 11, Detroit 1 -- Gary Gaetti singled to highlight a six-run first 
inning and later hit his first homer of the season at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Gordon (1-1) pitched the Royals to their fifth consecutive victory. The 
Tigers have lost four of five. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City combined five singles, one walk and an error in the opening 
inning. Gaetti's two-run single made it 4-0 and chased John Doherty (1-2) with 
one out. Gaetti hit a solo homer to the opposite field in the seventh off Joe 
Boever. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 7, St. Louis 1 -- Ryan Klesko, Fred McGriff and David Justice hit 
consecutive home runs in the first inning at Atlanta as the Braves won their 
sixth game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves hit three consecutive homers in the opening inning for the second 
time in four days. McGriff, Terry Pendleton and Tony Tarasco did it Friday 
during a 19-5 rout in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Avery (1-0) pitched six strong innings. The left-hander gave up two 
hits, one run, walked three and struck out four. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves quickly got to Rick Sutcliffe (1-1). Deion Sanders drew a leadoff 
walk and, after Jeff Blauser struck out, Klesko hit his fifth homer of the 
year, a 417-foot shot to center. 
</P>
<P>
 McGriff followed with his fourth of the season, a 420-foot drive to 
right-center, and then Justice cleared the fence in right with a 411-foot shot. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 2, Montreal 1 -- Barry Bonds tied the game with a home run in 
the ninth inning, then stole two bases and scored the winning run in the 11th 
to give the Giants the home victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds hit his fifth homer of the season, and second in two days, with one out 
in the ninth against reliever Jeff Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 11th, Bonds drew a one-out walk from Tim Scott (0-1) and stole second. 
After Todd Benzinger was walked intentionally, Bonds stole third. Pinch-hitter 
Mark Carreon followed with a single for his first hit in five at-bats this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 6, New York 3 -- Derek Bell homered twice and drove in a career-high 
five runs at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Kent hit his seventh home run in six games for the Mets, a two-run shot 
in the eighth that tied it at 3. He leads the majors with eight homers and 21 
runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell put the Padres ahead with a three-run homer in the bottom of the eighth 
off Jonathan Hurst (0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Bell also hit a two-run homer that capped a three-run sixth. He has four home 
runs this season, and two multi-homer games in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 5, Colorado 3 -- Jeff Conine's two-run double at Denver capped a 
three-run rally in the ninth inning against Colorado closer Darren Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss ended Colorado's four-game winning streak. Holmes (0-2), who relieved 
to start the ninth, has blown three of four save chances.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; DESHIELDS' INJURY AFFECTING HIS PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Delino DeShields, who is batting .125 with three runs batted in through the 
first seven games of this trip, remains troubled by a weakened thigh muscle. He 
has difficulty getting a good jump out of the batter's box, something that was 
evident in the fourth inning Sunday, when he was slow to run out a ground ball. 
DeShields said it is also impairing his ability to field balls hit to his 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Delino suffered a significant strain to his quadricep when he was 10," Dodger 
trainer Charlie Strasser said. "(It) healed and scar tissue was formed. He says 
it feels weak (and) we are trying to strengthen (it) with exercise." 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields said he is not in pain, but he is worried because he is not able to 
get the job done. "I'll be OK," he said. "It's just never bothered me like this 
before." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Chris Gwynn has pinch hit in three games and in two the team has batted 
around, giving him two outs in one inning. On April 14, he led off the eighth 
inning at St. Louis and singled to begin a five-run inning before ending the 
inning with a fly ball. On Sunday, he singled to lead off the Dodgers' nine-run 
seventh inning and grounded out to end the inning. Each time, Gwynn, who was 
considered the Dodgers' third left-handed pinch hitter off the bench, was 
inserted just to give him an at-bat. Dave Hansen, the team's No. 1 left-handed 
pinch hitter, ahead of Jeff Treadway, was saved for the pressure situations in 
which he excelled last season. But the result has been Gwynn getting more work 
than Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday night, Hansen pinch-hit a double in the seventh inning that kept 
a rally going that ended with a three-run homer by Mike Piazza. Gwynn pinch-ran 
for Hansen. It was Hansen's first hit in four at-bats this season. Gwynn is two 
for five as a pinch-hitter and Treadway is one for three. 
</P>

 Cory Snyder, rewarded for his three home runs and seven runs batted in Sunday, 
started in left field Monday and Henry Rodriguez started at first, instead of 
Eric Karros. With the Phillies starting right-hander Ben Rivera, Manager Tom 
Lasorda wanted to get Rodriguez's left-handed bat in the lineup. Karros, who is 
in a slump, pinch-hit in the seventh inning and stayed in the game. MARYANN

BRAVES CARRY OVER FAST FINISH IN '93 TO FAST START IN '94 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Atlanta Braves, who won the NL West with a second-half surge last season, 
have begun at an even faster pace in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves took a 12-1 mark, including a 10-0 road record, into Monday night's 
meeting at home with St. Louis. And in that game, Ryan Klesko, Fred McGriff and 
David Justice hit consecutive home runs in the first inning against Rick 
Sutcliffe. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday in Chicago, McGriff, Terry Pendleton and Tony Tarasco connected 
for three straight homers in a 19-5 rout. 
</P>
<P>
 It's apparently no coincidence that since last July 20, the day McGriff joined 
the Braves, the club is 63-18 (.778) and 39-7 on the road (.848). 
</P>
<P>
 "He's definitely been a part of it," said shortstop Jeff Blauser. "He's taken 
the pressure off some of our other big hitters and given us more of a threat to 
score runs in a big way." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only have the Braves won this season, they've done it dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Mercker, the club's No. 5 starter, pitched a no-hitter against the Los 
Angeles Dodgers on April 8. On Friday the Braves set an Atlanta franchise 
record by scoring 19 runs and getting 46 total bases against the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Through 13 games the Braves were hitting .301 and the pitching staff had a 
2.34 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wish for a start like this," manager Bobby Cox said. "I wish for it every 
season. This is the first time it's ever happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season the Braves didn't win their 12th game until May 1, when they were 
12-14, 4 1/2 games behind San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 With McGriff in the lineup last season, the Braves went 51-17 (.750) and made 
up a 10-game deficit to beat out the Giants for the West title on the last day 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, because of realignment, the Braves are now in the Eastern 
Division. Two weeks into the season, Atlanta already held a four-game lead in a 
division that includes Philadelphia and Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always think you're going to win every night. Every manager does," Cox 
said. "It just doesn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The start is the Braves' best since going 13-0 to start the 1982 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just been good pitching and a lot of hitting from our young guys," Cox 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookies have made a big splash. Klesko, playing left field in place of Ron 
Gant, who broke his leg during the winter and was released, leads the club with 
four home runs. He was hitting .366 with 11 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 First-year catcher Javier Lopez led the club with 12 RBIs and was hitting .286 
with three homers. 
</P>
<P>
 But it hasn't just been the young guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Deion Sanders, given the center field job when free agent Otis Nixon was 
allowed to sign with Boston, was hitting .333 with a couple of home runs and 11 
RBIs and was tied for the league lead in steals with six. 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton, playing third base, was hitting .351 with a pair of homers and 11 
RBIs. McGriff, meanwhile, was steady as usual. The left-handed power hitter, 
who has hit more than 30 homers in six consecutive seasons, was at .319 with 
three home runs and 11 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Maddux, who has won two straight Cy Young Awards, is 3-0 with an ERA of 
0.35; Tom Glavine, who is seeking a fourth consecutive 20-game season, is 2-0 
with a 2.45 ERA; and Mercker is a perfect 2-0 with an 0.56 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pitching is the one thing that's going to be a constant," Blauser said. "We 
sort of expect that. The run production, however, has been surprising." 
</P>
<P>
 For Charlie O'Brien, a catcher who played for the New York Mets last season 
when they lost 103 games, it has been a whole lot more: "It's like going from 
hell to heaven."

SOCCER / JULIE CART; WEGERLE IS FACING AN UPHILL BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's difficult not to feel bad for Roy Wegerle, except that he's not the sort 
who would allow it. Wegerle, one of the U.S. soccer team's most experienced 
players, has been brought to his knees by the ligaments and cartilage in them. 
He had surgery on his right knee last Friday for the third time since January. 
</P>
<P>
 Wegerle has not played for his club, Coventry City in the English Premier 
League, since being hurt in a game Jan. 8 and having surgery on his right knee 
10 days later. Recovery did not go well. After experiencing persistent swelling 
and pain, he had another operation last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The pain came back again and Wegerle stayed in England to rehabilitate his 
knee. But when it became clear that he would not be able to play for Coventry 
again this season, the club gave him permission to rejoin the U.S. team in 
Mission Viejo. Wegerle flew into L.A. last Thursday night and took a taxi 
directly from the airport to the team's doctor, Bert Mandelbaum. 
</P>
<P>
 An MRI test disclosed a tear of the lateral meniscus cartilage and Wegerle had 
more surgery Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Knee problems are never good news for a player or his team, but a third 
operation only eight weeks before the first game of the World Cup tournament is 
a blow. Wegerle plays as a withdrawn forward in Coach Bora Milutinovic's 
single-striker attack. It's a critical position for the U.S. team, one that 
involves both helping to set up goals and scoring them. 
</P>
<P>
 Wegerle's immediate goals, however, are to strengthen his knee and play with 
the team again. He said he expects to be running in about two weeks. He had 
been considered certain to be a starter. Now he has to consider himself in 
competition for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's impossible to forget what's at stake and what I have to do," Wegerle 
said from his hotel room in Mission Viejo. "It's certainly very hard. Having 
said that, I'm not going to go overboard with my rehab. I've got to do what I 
have to do. The staff will give me as much time as I a need. They'll give me 
every opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. coaches don't have much choice but to hope Wegerle heals. Said 
General Manager Bill Nuttall: "If he's a great healer, no problem. If he's not, 
there's a question mark in June." 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, Wegerle is waiting for the team to return to the training center 
later this week so he can get reacquainted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boys have been training together for more than a year," he said. "There 
is no substitute for that. For the six or seven of us based in Europe, we are 
missing out. I want to get back around the team. I want to talk to them and see 
what they feel. I have to get in and among them. This is like a family and we 
need to talk."

 When do normal security precautions generate abnormal responses? When the 
World Cup Organizing Committee's security department sends out security waivers 
to about 5,000 international media representatives and others seeking 
accreditation for this summer's tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The waiver would normally have been included in credential applications, but 
was inadvertently left out. When the memos were sent out recently, howls of 
protest arose from news organizations that called the waivers an invasion of 
privacy. Many are refusing to sign the forms. 
</P>
<P>
 The waiver gives the FBI, state and local law-enforcement agencies 
authorization to release "criminal history and criminal investigative records" 
of applicants to the WCOC. 
</P>
<P>
 Olympic organizing officials routinely run criminal checks on journalists 
applying for credentials. What they don't routinely do is draw attention to the 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at FIFA responded with chagrin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consider it unfortunate because of the way it was handled," a spokesman 
said. "However, for overall security and safety, it seems we have to live with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone recognizes the need for adequate security. But what's accomplished by 
screening journalists, players and coaches? What is the perceived threat? 
</P>
<P>
 Realistically, what are the odds that a terrorist will have a press pass? What 
if a journalist does has a criminal record, does that mean he or she poses a 
threat? Does that mean that a person without a record doesn't? 
</P>

 It seems as if the soccer calender in Germany is shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
 First a game against England was canceled because it was to have been played 
on Adolf Hitler's birthday, April 20, and the English feared neo-Nazi 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 As a consolation, the German Football Assn. awarded Berlin a game against 
Wales next year, one of Germany's qualifying matches for the 1996 European 
Championship. However, that match won't come off because it is scheduled for 
the birthday of another Nazi, Rudolf Hess. 
</P>
<P>
 The mass-circulation publication Bild noted that yet another game, Nov. 15 
against Bulgaria, is to be played on the birthday of Field Marshal Erwin 
Rommel. For future scheduling purposes, Bild published the dates of the 
potentially offending birthdays of Joseph Goebbels, Hermann Goering and 
Heinrich Himmler.

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: ORANGE COUNTY SECTION GAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County officials hoping to form their own section within the California 
Interscholastic Federation won a battle Monday, a rarity in this case, moving 
their dream closer to reality. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIF's Special Relations Committee voted, 6-0, to recommend approval of an 
Orange County Section. The proposal goes to the state federated council as a 
non-action item at its May meeting. The council could vote on the issue as 
early as next October. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Seal, superintendent of the Brea-Olinda Unified School District, said the 
new section could begin operating by the fall of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County superintendents began exploring the possibility of forming their 
own section two years ago, but have routinely met with opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of the school districts in Orange County are in favor of the new 
section, and some parochial and small public schools have said they might not 
join. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the confusion, the CIF is in the midst of strategic planning. The 
state council might be presented with new governing ideas and geographic 
boundaries as early as October. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategic planning committee is trying to reshape the CIF, which has 10 
sections that vary greatly in size. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew all along that our time line would face issues that would overlap or 
crisscross what we're doing," said Elisa Maas of the state strategic planning 
committee. "We have to concentrate on the future, however, and not worry about 
dealing with current matters." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 An estimated 3,000 athletes participated in the 36th Mt. San Antonio College 
Relays last Saturday, making it the biggest meet of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 But bigger does not necessarily mean better. 
</P>
<P>
 Considered one of the season's most prestigious meets, the Mt. SAC meet could 
use a new format. With no preliminaries, heats are run against times and marks. 
Competition lasted nearly 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The long day could be shortened if organizers followed the format used by the 
Arcadia Invitational. At Arcadia, the open session is run during the day and 
the invitational portion at night. This increases fan interest and cuts down on 
the time athletes have to wait between events. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Brownfield, girls' track coach at Pasadena Muir, said he is in favor of a 
format change and plans to talk to meet organizers about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a girl who started the long jump at 8 in the morning, and then had to 
wait until 6 at night for the mile relay," Brownfield said. "That makes for a 
very long day." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Noticeably absent from the Mt. SAC Relays was the Muir boys' team, favored to 
win the State title this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Although scheduled to compete, the Mustangs' top athletes were given the day 
off by Coach Clyde Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had over 10 track meets in the last month and a half, and we've been 
all over the country," Turner said. "I decided after Arcadia that our kids 
needed a day off. It is not so much the wear and tear from competition, but 
mentally they're drained." 
</P>
<P>
 Many in attendance were hoping to see Ken Haslip, who has the nation's fastest 
prep times in the 110-high hurdles and 300 hurdles. Haslip has a bruised right 
ankle and foot that he first injured during football season. 
</P>

<P>
 Are high school athletes so important that they should hold news conferences 
when announcing their college choices? 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 students and a dozen newspaper and television reporters showed up at 
Bellflower St. John Bosco High last Friday when Jelani Gardner made public his 
decision to play basketball at California next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Price of Gardena Serra, another top basketball prospect, also held a 
news conference when he announced he was going to Duke last November. 
</P>
<P>
 When Charles O'Bannon of Lakewood Artesia ended months of speculation by 
choosing UCLA last April, he told of his decision before a live cable 
television audience.  
</P>
<P>
 As coverage of high school sports has increased, top athletes have become 
household names in many instances. But news conferences? That's taking things a 
bit too far. 
</P>
<P>
 Choosing a college is a personal decision that should matter significantly to 
the athlete, his family, and, perhaps, his teammates and coach. Those who wish 
to share their decision with the media need only to pick up the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
 City sprint champion Andre DeSaussure of Woodland Hills Taft might have 
violated an NCAA recruiting rule by running in a relay at the Quincy Watts 
Invitational at USC last month. DeSaussure ran a leg on a 400 relay team that 
included Watts. The unattached relay team competed against several college 
teams, which is against the rules for prospective college athletes. As a 
result, USC has stopped recruiting DeSaussure and declared him ineligible to 
compete there. The school has petitioned the NCAA to restore his eligibility, 
however. . . . Tim Salter, football coach at Montebello Schurr the last six 
years, is leaving to take over the program at Upland. Salter's younger brother, 
Tom, recently became football coach at La Puente Bishop Amat. 
</P>
<P>
 Arraignment of football player Leodes Van Buren of Newbury Park, arrested 
April 8 for allegedly firing a single gunshot into the back door of his 
girlfriend's home, was postponed last Friday. Prosecutors said they needed more 
time to decide whether to press charges. Van Buren, an all-state player headed 
for Colorado, is due back in Ventura County Municipal Court on May 10.

DOW FALLS 41 AFTER FED RATE HIKE; BOND YIELDS HIT 15-MONTH HIGH; MARKETS: 
CENTRAL BANK'S THIRD INCREASE THIS YEAR TRIGGERS WAVE OF SELLLING BUT NO PANIC. 
BOND TRADERS FEAR MORE HIKES ARE IN STORE.

 Blue chip stocks plunged Monday after the Federal Reserve Board announced it 
was raising interest rates for the third time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 41.05 points to close at 3,620.42. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Treasury bond yields soared to their highest level since just 
before President Clinton's inauguration. The yield on the main 30-year bond 
rose to 7.42% from 7.28% on Friday. It was the highest the yield had finished 
since it stood at 7.47% in mid-January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow lost nearly 50 points early in the session, after the inflation-wary 
Fed announced the rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones 1,648 to 
625 in moderate trading of more than 271 million shares on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 News that the short-term rate was rising by 25 basis points to a new goal of 
3.75% triggered a wave of selling and the jump in long-term bond interest rates 
because attention was focused on inflation, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was somewhat surprised," said A.C. Moore, analyst at SBCM/Argus. "I thought 
the Fed had come far enough and fast enough, given the need to combat potential 
inflation." 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street has been hit by a series of 25-basis-point hikes in interest rates 
this year. The most devastating increase for the stock market was the first 
one, on Feb. 4, which sent the Dow down nearly 100 points. That was the first 
rate hike in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed also raised short-term rates on March 22, again driving the blue chip 
index sharply lower. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market is upset because "we still have the specter of more 
increases," said Philip Orlando, equity portfolio manager at First Capital 
Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The long bond's price fell 1 7/16 point, or $14.38 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities rose in Monday's 
auction to their highest levels in more than two years. The Treasury Department 
sold $11.8 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 3.76%, 
up from 3.63% last week. A further $11.8 billion worth was sold in six-month 
bills at an average discount rate of 4.21%, up from 4.03%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's increasing short-term rates mean speculators and others who had 
bought bonds with borrowed money would have to pay more to hold the securities. 
That reality encouraged selling, said William Sullivan, director of 
money-market research at Dean Witter, Discover & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise in long-term interest rates also shows doubt in the market that the 
Fed's action will stave off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an attitude that what the Fed has done so far in 1994 is not enough 
to break the economy's momentum," Sullivan said. "These modest moves are 
perceived as insufficient medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow had been up more than six points before the Fed announced its 
intention to tighten credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market got crushed pretty quickly on the Fed news, and mounted one or two 
attempts at a rally, but never really made it," said George Pirrone, senior 
trader at Dreyfus Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the selling did not reach panic levels. They noted moderate 
volume and the market's stability once it hit the session's lows, around 3,613 
on the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of people have resigned themselves to riding it out," said Guy 
Truicko, equity portfolio manager at Unity Management. The market "really 
hasn't gotten hit as bad as I thought it would." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the trading highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * General Electric dropped 1 7/8 to 94 7/8 after its Kidder, Peabody unit said 
it had fired the head of its government trading desk since the firm uncovered a 
scheme of phantom trades and profits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Merrill Lynch rose 1 to 36 1/4 after reporting earnings exceeding Wall 
Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Digital Equipment dropped 1 7/8 to 21 1/8 after losing 5 7/8 on Friday 
following its report of a third-quarter loss that was far worse that analysts 
had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chase Manhattan ended 5/8 higher, at 34 3/8, on better-than-expected 
first-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Platinum Software shrank 6 7/16 to 3-9/16. Its top management resigned after 
news that third-quarter revenues would be less than expected, and results for 
at least the previous four quarters would be restated. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign trading, Mexican stocks fell to a five-month low following a rise 
in the U.S. federal funds rate, traders said. The key IPC index lost 61.02 
points, or 2.78%, to 2,137.62. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down 30.1 
at 3,138.2. In Frankfurt, the 30-share DAX index closed 1.29% higher, bolstered 
by heavy interest in cyclical, automotive and auto supplier stocks. The DAX 30 
index ended at 2,228.78, up 28.36 points. In Tokyo, the Nikkei average ended up 
112.73 points to 20,277.36. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar fell against major foreign currencies after the Federal Reserve 
surprised the markets by raising short-term rates. In New York, the dollar fell 
to 103.15 yen from 103.45 yen on Friday. The British pound closed at $1.4765, 
up from $1.4715 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the Commodity Exchange in New York, April gold dropped 90 cents to 
$376.80 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 * In energy trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude 
oil for May delivery rose 7 cents to $16.65 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 * Corn futures prices dropped to a 5 1/2-month low Monday on the Chicago Board 
of Trade as warm, dry weather in the Midwest created ideal planting conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Other grain and soybean futures ended mixed, with most wheat futures rising 
with the news that China would bid for U.S. wheat. 
</P>
<P>
 Corn futures fell by 2 3/4 cents to 6 cents, with the contract for May 
delivery down 3 1/4 cents at $2.61 3/4 a bushel.

 Things have gotten sticky as two U.S. companies battle for big shares of 
Britain's chewing gum market.After Warner Lambert complained that sales 
representatives from Wrigley were removing display cases of Dentyne and Clorets 
from stores, the government obtained assurances from Wrigley that the practice 
would stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrigley controls 88% of the British market but has seen Warner Lambert chewing 
up a bigger piece of the action recently. Warner Lambert has the other 12%, 
about double the company's market share of five years ago.

THEATER REVIEW; DATED 'BROADWAY' HAS ITS BRIGHT SPOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You have to know musicals to appreciate "Forbidden Broadway 1994," the revue 
at the Tiffany. Its clever lampoons of Broadway icons might be lost on those 
who don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Among its two-dozen sketches is a "Sunset Boulevard" takeoff mounted by the 
New York-based company for L.A. Without giving away the jokes, let's just say 
that writer-director Gerard Alessandrini not only puts Glenn Close (Susanne 
Blakeslee) and Patti LuPone (Christine Pedi) on the same stage and incorporates 
elements of the "Sunset" plot into their rivalry, but he also throws in Joe 
(Brad Oscar) and, best of all, a wickedly made up Andrew Lloyd Webber (Oscar 
again). Too bad there's no sign of Faye Dunaway or Diana Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 The zingers sting Close more than LuPone, but LuPone already took a few lumps 
in an unrelated "Evita" sketch earlier in the show. Alessandrini generally 
adheres to equal opportunity needling. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Sunset" sketch and a number about the expanding role of Disney on 
Broadway ("Be Depressed," to the tune of "Be Our Guest") rationalize the "1994" 
in the title. Some of the other material, while new to L.A., feels dated. That 
"Evita" sketch, for example -- it's been quite a while since Barbra Streisand 
or Madonna were considered for the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Madonna, obviously a tempting target, also is part of the show's only parody 
of a non-musical, a put-down of her appearance in David Mamet's 
"Speed-the-Plow" in 1988 in New York. While the adaptation of "My Fair Lady" to 
this situation is deftly done, it's a bit remote, especially for a non-New York 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 A sketch that attempts to parody Mary Martin and Ethel Merman surely predates 
the stars' deaths, which now make the number pointless and tasteless. Not that 
we weren't warned -- the opening song promises some below-the-belt humor. 
Pedi's plucky Merman impression is still a kick, but Blakeslee's Martin seems 
inaccurate as well as mean -- portraying the late star as wispy instead of 
perky. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the other sketches, however, appear freshly minted in the wake of 
recent musical offerings in L.A. We've seen so much Tommy Tune and Michael 
Crawford that Craig Wells' acerbic solo takeoffs on the two men sound as if 
they might have been created for L.A. Likewise with his Michael Damian in 
"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat," which was a big hit here before 
it went to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely there are plenty of customers who'll appreciate this company's thorough 
skewering of "Les Miserables." And Alessandrini's Sondheim spoof, "Into the 
Words," is almost as dazzling as a real Sondheim number. 
</P>
<P>
 Kudos also to wig designer Teresa Vuoso, costumers Alvin Colt and Erika Dyson, 
and pianist Brad Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
 The show concludes with an appeal to bring back shows with "heart" -- ironic, 
perhaps, considering this show's lack of it. But then satirists shouldn't worry 
about being nice, and these folks are the sharpest theater satirists in town. 
</P>
<P>

NIXON IN SERIOUS CONDITION AFTER SUFFERING STROKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former President Richard Nixon suffered a stroke Monday and was hospitalized 
in serious condition, his spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, 81, was felled at his Park Ridge, N.J., home and was taken by ambulance 
to New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, spokeswoman Kim Taylor said from 
New Jersey. He was admitted to intensive care for observation and treatment 
with blood-thinner, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Migliore, a spokeswoman for the hospital, confirmed that Nixon was 
there but said she could not provide further details. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid impeachment in the Watergate scandal, Nixon, the nation's 37th chief 
executive, became the only President ever to resign. He served in the White 
House from Jan. 20, 1969, to Aug. 9, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon dropped from the limelight after his forced retirement but surfaced 
frequently through extensive travel, books, articles and speeches. He visited 
Russia last month and caused a stir by meeting with right-wing leader Vladimir 
Zhirinovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his visit, Nixon said he had done something "that no one has 
ever done, something that I have not done in my 10 visits to the Soviet Union. 
I met with every opposition leader. I covered everybody. It is very important 
in a democracy not to just meet the leaders in power." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon was a dedicated anti-communist at the start of his political career. As 
President, he ended two decades of distance and distrust between the United 
States and China -- exchanging toasts with Chairman Mao Tse-tung in Beijing's 
Forbidden City. He established a live-and-let-live policy of detente toward the 
Soviet Union and negotiated arms control agreements with its leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon inherited the Vietnam War and the hatreds it engendered at home. In the 
1968 presidential campaign, Nixon asked voters, he recalled later, "to take on 
faith my ability to end the war." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon came to the presidency after nearly a quarter-century as a Republican 
officeholder -- congressman, senator and vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 A month after he resigned, the country was outraged when Nixon's successor, 
Gerald R. Ford, issued a pardon for all crimes that Nixon "committed or may 
have committed or taken part in" during his presidency. Ford noted that Nixon 
had become liable "to possible indictment and trial." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nixons lived in virtual exile in San Clemente for more than five years 
after his resignation. They moved east in 1980 to be near their grandchildren, 
Jennie, Melanie and Alex Eisenhower and Christopher Cox. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, Nixon nearly died after suffering a recurrence of phlebitis, 
inflammation of the veins, and resulting complications from surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's wife, Pat, died last year of lung cancer.

 As Endeavour's six astronauts packed up for the trip home, the shuttle mission 
operations director gave it an A+ for its 10-day Earth surveying mission, as "a 
perfect platform for doing science." If today's landing opportunities at the 
Kennedy Space Center are missed, the space shuttle, which blasted off April 9, 
has enough supplies to stay aloft for three more days.Forecasts called for 
acceptable weather in the seaside runway, with light winds and a slight chance 
of offshore rain. A $366-million set of radar instruments was to be shut down 
about seven hours before landing. Officials said the radar has captured all of 
the planned views of Earth and will be used to study the environment, the 
forest conditions and the mountain, river and desert geology.

THE LESSONS OF SUMMER; ANGEL PITCHER ANDERSON LEARNED CONTROL EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The gathering dusk obscured her view from the porch, but the pop . . . pop of 
the baseball hitting the old catcher's mitt her husband used was loud and 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Anderson's boy was in the yard between their Geneva, Ohio, home and the 
family's two-bay tire store, working on his control. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad would take me out back and catch me," Brian Anderson said. "Before the 
session was over, he'd pick a certain spot in the strike zone and put his glove 
there. I'd have to hit it 10 times in a row before we could quit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes we'd be out there an awful long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, now a 21-year-old rookie starter with the Angels, was only a Little 
Leaguer then. And the emphasis was on little. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everywhere I played, I was always the smallest player, so I couldn't blow 
people away," he said. "Even in high school, I relied on my control." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Anderson had always loved baseball and was determined that his son would 
throw strikes. So many strikes that the catcher's mitt, a $4 bargain bought at 
a going-out-of-business sale, had to be retired. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it was never work for us, always fun," Jim said. "I used to hate it when 
September came and Brian and (daughter) Kara went back to school. We have a 
pretty good-size yard in back of the store and, when business was slow, we'd 
play all sorts of different games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brian would pitch to me and if he walked a guy, it was a run for me. Then 
I'dpitch and if I walked a guy, it was a run for him. Or sometimes Kara would 
hit, she's the stick in the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Janice would watch and serve as referee. Because if Brian wasn't perfect, 
he'd quit and go into the house until she told him to get back out there." 
</P>
<P>
 A decade later, bone chips start floating around in Mark Langston's elbow and 
Brian Anderson is suddenly a starting pitcher in the big leagues, where all too 
often a walk does mean a run for the other team. So the control he mastered 
pitching to his dad -- and the square painted on the side of the tire store 
where imaginary batters hit ground balls off pitches in the lower half of the 
square -- is paying off. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first big league start this season, Anderson gave up five hits and a 
run in 8 1/3 innings against Milwaukee on April 10, earning his first major 
league victory. Friday night, he gave up four hits and two earned runs in six 
innings against Toronto. His earned-run average is 1.88. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's pretty poised out there," catcher Greg Myers said. "In that first game, 
he had all his stuff working. He's got a lot of confidence and that's great for 
a young guy. And he's got good command of four pitches, and that keeps guys off 
balance." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's fastball is generally in the low 90s, but he has no qualms about 
throwing a curve, slider or changeup at any point in the count. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that I've matured physically to the point where I'm stronger and throwing 
the ball harder than ever, that control has stayed with me," he said. "I think 
it's a big advantage. I think it's why I'm here at this age. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you come up here and all you can do is throw 100 m.p.h., these guys are 
going to catch up to it sooner or later. Having confidence in four pitches has 
really helped me. It's just that many more weapons I can use against these 
hitters, and these hitters are the best in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson walked only six and struck out 98 during his senior season at Wright 
State University in Dayton, but he has discovered that the best hitters in the 
world like strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest thing Brian has had to learn since he's become a pro is how to 
pitch outside the strike zone," Manager Buck Rodgers said. "There's control and 
then there's control within the strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to live on the outside corner, then you're also going to have 
to come inside. If you want the curve and change to work, then you have to keep 
them off the plate." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, Anderson is a quick study. He hit two Blue Jays on Friday night. 
Roberto Alomar, who loves to dive at outside pitches and shoot line drives to 
right, caught one on the shoulder and Anderson showed he is prepared to face 
the consequences of pitching inside. 
</P>
<P>
 As Alomar glared at the mound, Anderson told him to "get to first base." When 
Alomar asked him what he had said, Anderson blew a large bubble with his gum, 
walked halfway to Alomar, popped the bubble and then said it again, loud enough 
to be heard. 
</P>
<P>
 First base umpire Rick Reed stepped between the two and told Anderson to 
return to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a lot of (guts)," the Angels' Chili Davis said. "I'll definitely 
give him credit for that. He's got just enough cockiness about him to warrant 
some success up here. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a young guy who knows how to pitch, but he's no nibbler. He comes at 
you. And he's got the (guts). Up here, that's what really matters." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson was barely 5 feet 10 and weighed 160 pounds when he graduated from 
Geneva High School. There wasn't exactly a line of coaches waiting to buy tires 
to impress mom and dad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was throwing in the low- to mid-80s, tops, and no big school wanted to take 
a chance," Anderson said. "But Wright State came after me pretty hard. The 
coach there, Ron Nischwitz, was a left-handed pitcher in the major leagues for 
four years with Cleveland and Detroit. He thought it would be a good spot for 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I matured there physically and learned a lot from him about mental toughness. 
I had some good summers with the U.S. Olympic travel team, some success up in 
the Cape Cod League and things just kind of took off." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, with the third pick in the 1993 free-agent draft, selected him in 
the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had heard I was going to be top five and this and that, but you're wise not 
to bank on too much because you never know what's going to happen on draft 
day," he said. "But, to be honest, I have high expectations for myself and I 
would have been disappointed if I didn't go high. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, the Angels took me and there are some great opportunities for me 
in the organization. Hopefully, I can take advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson pitched 11 1/3 innings with the Angels during the final weeks of last 
season, but he wasn't exactly a sensation until he shut down the Brewers and 
entertained reporters during a postgame interview laced with one-liners. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel veterans watched in fascination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he started at, like, age 2 and tried to do his whole life in 30 
minutes," Chuck Finley said. "He seems like he's more polished than most guys 
you see right out of college like that, but he's got just enough flakiness in 
him that we might be able to do something with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll be all right. He's got a good work ethic and he wants to improve. Plus, 
he didn't come in here thinking he already knew everything, which is highly 
irregular these days." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Anderson says he never considered that the little southpaw trying to 
strike out his sister was a potential major leaguer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a point in high school where it occurred to me that he might be 
able to get a college scholarship," he said. "But when you consider the odds of 
making it to the big leagues, it's pretty hard to believe. It's a wild dream 
come true." 
</P>
<P>
 The dream probably will be shown live and in prime time in the Anderson 
household Thursday night when Brian pitches against Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brian and I have been Indians' fans all our lives," Jim Anderson said. "We 
always had the radio out on the stump where we were playing, but it's amazing 
how comfortable I feel rooting for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "With so many games televised these days, we have to get a satellite dish. 
I've got a mint-condition 1973 Volkswagen Thing with just 12,000 miles on it 
and I'm going to sell it so we can buy one." 
</P>
<P>
 The Andersons had a date with a satellite-dish salesman Monday night. Unlike 
Brian, he didn't need a great pitch.

IT WAS A FIGHT TO THE FINISH; GOOSSENS BEGIN WITH LITTLE BUT END WITH MUCH 
RESPECT 
</P>

<P>
 For Gabriel Ruelas, it was just another day of selling candy door to door, 
just another San Fernando Valley street on which to ply his trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Little did he dream that when he knocked on the door of the house at the end 
of the North Hollywood cul-de-sac his life would change forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 12-year-old Ruelas knew this was the headquarters of the Ten Goose 
Boxing Club -- his brother, Juan, had trained there once for a month -- the 
house held a special fascination. 
</P>
<P>
 From the outside, the single-story structure looked like the typical 1980s 
Valley home. On the inside, however, there was only one room, dominated by a 
ring. On the sides were punching bags, each of them undergoing a furious 
pounding. On the walls were yellowed posters from famous and not-so-famous 
fights. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time he knocked on that door, a few days later, Ruelas had left his 
candy at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be a fighter," he told trainer Joe Goossen. 
</P>
<P>
 Goossen, trying to get a struggling operation started, had no time for kids 
with wild dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe some other time," he told Ruelas. 
</P>
<P>
 Goossen might be excused for taking Ruelas lightly, but, really, he should 
have understood. After all, Goossen and his family also were chasing wild 
dreams then.  
</P>
<P>
 Ruelas, the No. 1 contender in the World Boxing Council's junior lightweight 
division, eventually became part of the Goossen legacy, one that ended recently 
when financial constraints forced the family to close shop after 12 colorful 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the time, the Ten Goose Boxing Club was that rarest of sports entities, 
a mom-and-pop operation that succeeded. Many of the 10 children of Al and Ann 
Goossen were actively involved in turning the fight game into a family business 
and developing such local talent as Gabriel Ruelas. 
</P>
<P>
 None of them had overwhelming credentials when they began.  
</P>
<P>
 Al, who served as promoter, had spent much of his life in the Los Angeles 
Police Department. Dan, who was to serve as manager of the fighters, had sold 
office supplies. The closest he had been to the ring was when he had served as 
Mr. T's manager. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. 
</P>
<P>
 They built a ring under a tree in the front yard that had once served as the 
family Whiffle-ball field and eventually put four walls around it. 
</P>
<P>
 Brothers Joe and Larry would serve as trainers. Sisters Sandy and Ellorie, 
along with their mother, would work the ticket booth. Brothers Mike and Gordon, 
both lawyers, would represent the family's legal interests. 
</P>
<P>
 And also helping in the corner would be brother Greg, the only family member 
to have had success in professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Ten Goose, Greg's success was in baseball. A catcher in the 
Dodger organization and later with several other teams, Goossen, had once 
played for legendary Manager Casey Stengel with the New York Mets. Stengel once 
introduced him by saying, "This is Goossen. He's 19 years old and he's got a 
good chance to be 29 in 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Rival promoters didn't figure Ten Goose would be in existence in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Goossens, as enthusiastic as they were naive, ignored those who 
scoffed.  
</P>
<P>
 They formed Ten Goose in 1982 and got everything ready to go, except fighters. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Where to look? 
</P>
<P>
 They started in their neighborhood and found a guy at the car wash. He said 
his name was Nacho and he wanted to be a fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We bought him trunks and hand wraps and everything," Dan said. "We brought 
Sonny Shields (an established trainer) over. We got him some sparring 
partners." 
</P>
<P>
 But then Nacho took a punch in the nose and decided he didn't want to be a 
fighter. He took off, with his trunks and all the rest of the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, the Goossens signed a Rolls-Royce salesman. He had seven fights and went 
back to selling luxury cars.  
</P>
<P>
 But eventually, the Goossens found people who wouldn't quit. 
</P>
<P>
 They managed both Gabriel Ruelas and his brother, Rafael, the International 
Boxing Federation lightweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
 They resurrected the career of bantamweight Frankie Duarte, whose boxing 
skills had been ravaged by drugs and alcohol. His comeback went all the way to 
a title shot against World Boxing Assn. champion Bernardo Pinango. Duarte lost 
a close decision, but had regained control of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 The Goossens took Michael Nunn from Olympic alternate to the International 
Boxing Federation middleweight title before he left in a contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 They were promoters for former WBC super-welterweight champion Terry Norris. 
</P>
<P>
 They trained, managed and promoted dozens of other fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 And, for a decade, they staged fights at the Reseda Country Club. Once a 
month, the 1,000-seat Country Club would be packed with film stars and young 
businessmen and women, wildly cheering for their favorite fighters in a 
nightclub atmosphere where the blood and sweat flowed with the beer and wine. 
</P>
<P>
 After the death of Al Goossen in 1985, veteran character actor Victor French 
became a key figure in Ten Goose, lending money and emotional support. 
</P>
<P>
 French and fellow actor Gene Hackman became part of the traveling entourage 
when Ten Goose boxers fought out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in the end, the lack of television money and other financial resources 
hurt Ten Goose. Now, Dan is going to work for Bob Arum's Top Rank boxing 
organization, promoting bimonthly fights at the renovated Olympic Auditorium 
and elsewhere. The regular monthly fights at the Country Club were discontinued 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In its day, though, Ten Goose produced some unforgettable moments.  
</P>
<P>
 There was the fighter who panicked in his corner after getting badly beaten in 
one round. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got something in his gloves," the fighter screamed at Greg, who was 
working the corner that night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," Greg calmly replied. "It's his fists." 
</P>
<P>
 There was the fighter who was recruited on short notice and arrived in 
horrible shape. He put on an embarrassing performance and suffered a 
first-round knockout. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been different if I had trained or something," the fighter 
said. "I could have lasted two rounds." 
</P>
<P>
 There was Duarte in 1989, facing the end of his career, bitter at having to 
leave without the title he had so long sought. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't want to fight anymore," he said. "I'd rather walk out of the 
fight game than go out on my back because I've had one fight too many. Who am I 
kidding? I'm a 34-year-old man. I have a great chin, but there's always that 
night the chin turns to rust." Said Dan: "It was a hell of a run."  
</P>
<P>
 And, in a way, it continues.  
</P>
<P>
 Rafael Ruelas has signed with Top Rank and Gabriel is expected to follow. Nunn 
has talked about returning to the Goossens. Joe will become an independent 
trainer. Larry Goossen runs a gym in Big Bear. Greg has carved out a new career 
with bit acting parts.

NDETI'S DOUBTERS LEFT IN HIS WAKE; BOSTON MARATHON: KENYAN WINS FOR THE SECOND 
TIME IN AS MANY TRIES, BREAKING THE COURSE RECORD. PIPPIG WINS THE WOMEN'S 
TITLE IN RECORD TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago, Cosmas Ndeti was a novice marathon runner and an aspiring 
entrepreneur. Now he's a two-time winner of the Boston Marathon and a landlord. 
</P>
<P>
 Ndeti can buy more apartments in Kenya because he took the lead in the 22nd 
mile Monday, stretched it to 50 yards, then held on to win the 98th running of 
the event in 2 hours 7 minutes 15 seconds, the fastest marathon in six years, 
and fifth fastest ever. It was only 25 seconds off the world best of 2:06:50, 
set by Belayneh Densimo of Ethiopia at Rotterdam in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Running in ideal conditions, with temperatures in the 50s and a tail wind, 
Ndeti earned $25,000 for breaking Rob de Castella's 1986 course record by 36 
seconds and $70,000 when he finished four seconds faster than second-place 
Andres Espinosa of Mexico on a day of record times. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's winner Uta Pippig of Berlin also earned $95,000, running 2:21:45 to 
break Joan Benoit Samuelson's old Boston mark by 62 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The race was so fast that the first U.S. runner, Bob Kempainen, a medical 
student from Minneapolis, broke Alberto Salazar's 12-year-old American record 
by five seconds in 2:08:47, yet finished seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 With appearance money, Ndeti earned more than $100,000, which he can put 
toward his real estate company, begun after winning at Boston last year in only 
his second marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fourth consecutive Boston men's victory by a Kenyan, and fifth in 
seven years. It also refuted those who had said that last year's victory was a 
fluke. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he was learning. This year, he had a three-day seminar in Portland, 
Ore., with '82 Boston winner Salazar, who, along with now annual jogging 
partner President Clinton -- they will run Wednesday morning in Washington -- 
is Ndeti's new pal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alberto told me that if you aren't running with the lead pack, run your own 
race," Ndeti said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no lead pack for much of the race, so instead, he listened to 
his body, which told him to start pressing two miles earlier than he had in 
last year's victory. So much for scientific running. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was more concerned with how I was feeling than with time," said Ndeti, who, 
for the second consecutive year ran the second half of the race -- generally 
considered the tougher because it includes the hills of Newton -- faster than 
the first. "I was concentrating on feeling my body and how the other guys were 
running, not with the clock." 
</P>
<P>
 With each pass in working his way up through the pack, Ndeti looked at his 
opponent, sized him up and decided if he was somebody to worry about later. 
</P>
<P>
 He generally wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 In the closing miles, only Espinosa was a threat, and Ndeti kept looking back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't judge how tired he was getting because he was behind me," Ndeti 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Very tired, as it turned out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I could catch him, but near the end, I realized I would be short," 
said Espinosa, who also earned a $25,000 bonus for breaking the course record. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson Kipngok of Kenya was third, 53 seconds behind the winner, and 
Barcelona Olympic gold medalist Hwang Young-Jo of Korea was fourth, in 2:08.09. 
</P>
<P>
 For Pippig, it was as easy as running 26 miles 385 yards can be. She ran in a 
group, frequently behind South Africa's Colleen De Reuck, for half the race, 
took off in the hills, ran with track specialist and first-time marathoner 
Elana Meyer of South Africa on her shoulder until the 20th mile, then said 
goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end, Pippig cried. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been training hard, with Boston in mind, in Colorado and got to Boston 
five days before the race," she said. "It was raining and I was running and I 
got sick. I was crying because of that, because I trained so hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stayed in bed, called a doctor and was told it was just a cold and it would 
go away. Today, it did." 
</P>
<P>
 She felt so good that a world record was a possibility until reality set in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the last three or four miles about the world record, but I slowed 
the last two miles because I was tired," she said. "I trained to run 2:22, and 
I need one more year to get the world record." 
</P>
<P>
 It's 2:21.06. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentina Yegorova of Russia, the Olympic champion in Barcelona, was second in 
2:23:33. Olga Markova, who was trying to win here for the third consecutive 
year, dropped out at 18 miles.  
</P>
<P>
 The 9,059-runner field was led through most of the first half by Keith 
Brantley of Ormond Beach, Fla., whose edge went to 200 yards at one point. He 
fell back and finished 20th. 
</P>
<P>
 The day belonged to Ndeti, who this year brought his family along, including 
his son, Gideon Boston Ndeti. Gideon celebrated his first birthday Sunday, and 
Cosmas had him in his arms seconds after Monday's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Marathon Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Heinz Frei of Switzerland, in 1:21:22, and Jean Driscoll of Champaign, Ill., 
in 1:34:22, were the wheelchair winners, both setting race records. Frei's time 
was also a world record. . . . Jim Knaub of Long Beach, who has won the 
wheelchair division five times, including the last three, finished 30th.

JIM MURRAY: A BULLISH OUTLOOK FOR DERBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is the considered opinion of the standard American racing fan, indeed of 
the racing Establishment itself, that the Kentucky Derby is best taken on by a 
horse defined as a "router," i.e., one that can run all day, or any part of it, 
at a measured speed and usually wins his races from behind in the last furlong 
or so.  
</P>
<P>
 In other words, sprinters need not apply. You always find the winner in the 
caboose of the race in the early going. Ignore that horse flying on the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The track is supposed to be deeper, more tiring, and the trainers tend to put 
more stamina than swiftness into their horses' workouts. Laz Barrera used to 
train for Derby victories on gallops alone.  
</P>
<P>
 The nation becomes critical in this year of Our Lord because the racing 
Establishment has come upon a puzzlement, a standout horse who wins his races 
like a quarter horse, streaking away from everybody and daring them to catch 
him.  
</P>
<P>
 They can't. Holy Bull simply gets out there and, in the parlance of the track, 
steals every race.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, stealing a Florida Derby or a Blue Grass is not like stealing that 
race at Churchill Downs the first Saturday in May. That is grand theft. The 
others are petty larceny. Churchill is supposed to be set up for the cleanup 
hitters, not the leadoff men. You come up an eighth of a mile short in the 
Derby if you go rollicking out there like an Elk on a picnic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stealing" a race in the strictest sense of the term is supposed to indicate a 
use of subterfuge. You roll out there in what appear to be blistering 
fractions, but aren't. Johnny Longden was the master of this. He won about 
8,000 races daring you to get by him.  
</P>
<P>
 It's winning wire to wire that upsets the purists. You are not supposed to win 
the Kentucky Derby that way.  
</P>
<P>
 But the simplest examination of the history of that race will show it's not 
uncommon.  
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1955, one of my all-time favorite thoroughbreds, Swaps, won the Santa 
Anita Derby (with Longden aboard) wire to wire, and he was supposed to be 
"short" -- behind in conditioning for the year -- in the race.  
</P>
<P>
 "He'll never do that in Louisville," darkly predicted the backstretch 
hardboots.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, he did. Part of that was because the connections of the Eastern 
challenger, Nashua, bought the myth that you don't win the Derby from ahead. By 
the time Nashua picked him up, Swaps was on his way to the barn. Swaps had 
plenty of run left when they hit the stretch. He had not used up much running a 
1:37 mile.  
</P>
<P>
 Order seemed to have been restored the very next year when Needles came from 
16th at the three-quarters to run down the leaders in the stretch. The Derby is 
more used to that scenario.  
</P>
<P>
 But it's uncanny how many times horses have won wire to wire at Churchill. For 
every Cavalcade and Whirlaway and Twenty Grand who liked to come from far out 
of it, there was a Count Fleet (with Longden aboard) saying "Come catch me!" 
for 10 furlongs.  
</P>
<P>
 In antiquity, front-runners dominated the Derby. Sir Barton, the first Triple 
Crown winner, led wire to wire. So did the first filly winner, Regret, in 1915. 
Riva Ridge, Winning Colors, the last filly to win; Jet Pilot, Hoop Jr., 
Johnstown and War Admiral led every panel. Man o' War never ran in the Kentucky 
Derby, but was a wire-to-wire winner in the Preakness and the Belmont -- which 
he won by 20 lengths -- in his year, 1920.  
</P>
<P>
 The greatest upset in Derby history was pulled off by wire-to-wire winner Dark 
Star, whom the 7-10 shot Native Dancer couldn't catch. It was the only race the 
Dancer ever lost.  
</P>
<P>
 So the field at Kentucky on May 7 has a neat problem. In Holy Bull's last two 
races -- and seven of his last eight -- he has run unmolested to victory on the 
front end. It was considered suicidal to match strides with him out of the 
gate.  
</P>
<P>
 But now it's suicidal not to. Standard strategy in matters of this kind calls 
for the trainer to field an entry and have one of them be the sacrificial lamb 
who will lead Holy Bull in such dizzying fractions that even he will tire.  
</P>
<P>
 This is not possible at Louisville, where a horse has to have met money-won 
conditions to get in the gate. You can't merely pick up a speedball at 
Lexington and van him over anymore.  
</P>
<P>
 So, other trainers are in the position of a fight manager -- do they want 
their charge to go out there and slug with Holy Bull? That's like rushing to 
center ring against Mike Tyson and throwing crazy rights. A better plan would 
seem to be to stand clear and hope he tires himself out.  
</P>
<P>
 If nobody goes out there and steps up the pace, it won't be a race, it will be 
a parade. Whoever wins had better be prepared to put up with a lot of Bull. And 
if he wins from the front end, as usual, his handlers will be able to turn and 
shrug, "Doesn't everybody?"

</P>
<P>
 Traded by the Astros to Los Angeles for pitcher Claude Osteen before the start 
of the 1974 campaign, center fielder Wynn started his brief Dodger career with 
a bang, hitting a home run on opening day. He hit 31 more that season, earning 
the Sporting News' award as comeback player of the year and leading the club to 
its first pennant in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick- 
</P>
<P>
 named "The Toy Cannon" for his explosive bat, Wynn played only one more season 
for the Dodgers, then was traded to Atlanta in a multi-player deal that brought 
Dusty Baker to Los Angeles. Now 52, he is a motivational speaker and does 
community-affairs work in Houston. DOUG DECINCES 
</P>
<P>
 DeCinces had some solid years with the Orioles after replacing Hall of Famer 
Brooks Robinson at third base, but he blossomed when he was traded to the 
Angels in 1982. He hit 30 home runs and batted .301 that year, leading the club 
to its second divisional championship in franchise history. DeCinces averaged 
22 homers a season in his California career, which ended in late 1987 when he 
was released to make room for Jack Howell. 
</P>
<P>
 DeCinces, 44, is president and a part-owner of DeCinces Properties, a 
developer and property-management company in Newport Beach. He also is a sports 
agent with, ironically, one client, Jack Howell, who now plays in Japan. DAVID

 The Golden State Warriors, the NBA's most improved team, played the Clippers, 
the NBA's most decayed team, on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Clippers, out of the playoffs for the first time in three seasons, 
once again displayed why they are one of the biggest disappointments in the NBA 
as they squandered a 16-point first-half lead and lost in overtime, 134-131, 
before an announced crowd of 10,969 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was disappointing that we had the big lead and let it get away from us," 
said Clipper forward Loy Vaught, who had 16 points an 10 rebounds before 
fouling out. "We were trying to end the season on a positive note, so this 
makes it tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper forward Dominique Wilkins, who had 37 points and 10 rebounds, became 
the ninth player in NBA history to score 24,000 points. Guard Ron Harper had 30 
points, nine rebounds and eight assists for the Clippers, who have lost 13 of 
their last 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never knew anything about the record until I heard them announce it," 
Wilkins said. "It was no big deal for me. It was just another day on the job. I 
thought we should have won this game, no question about it. We have to learn 
from our mistakes and go from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Mullin scored a season-high 32 points as the Warriors extended their 
winning streak to a season-high six games. Rookie forward Chris Webber had 25 
points and 15 rebounds and center Billy Owens had 25 points, seven rebounds and 
seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing by 124-121 in overtime, the Clippers tied the score at 126 as Wilkins 
scored five points. But a basket by Latrell Sprewell, who missed 16 of 20 shots 
and had only nine points, gave the Warriors a 128-126 lead with 1:39 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Jennings, who made six free throws in the final 1:16 of the five-minute 
overtime period, added two free throws after he was fouled by John Williams to 
give the Warriors a four-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 After Wilkins made a lay-in with 27 seconds left, the Warriors took a 132-128 
lead when Jennings made two more free throws with 15 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers called a timeout to set up a play and Wilkins made a 
three-pointer from the top of the key with 12.5 seconds left. But the Clippers 
waited too long before they fouled Jennings to stop the clock. Jennings made 
two free throws with 7.2 seconds left to give the Warriors a three-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers used their final timeout to set up a play, but Gary Grant's 
three-pointer from the left corner went in and out and Wilkins missed a 
desperation shot at the buzzer.

RAIDERS SIGN FREE AGENT GUARD GOGAN TO CHALLENGE MONTOYA 
</P>

<P>
 Changing of the guard? 
</P>
<P>
 That appears to be the scenario for the Raiders, who Monday signed Dallas 
Cowboy guard Kevin Gogan to a three-year, $3.6-million contract. Gogan, an 
unrestricted free agent, will receive $1.85 million this season, the total 
breaking down to a base salary of $550,000 plus a $1.3 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-7, 319-pound Gogan has been told he'll be given an opportunity to 
win the starting job at right guard held by veteran Max Montoya, 38 next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Gogan, 29, a seven-year veteran, thinks things might have turned out 
differently if Dallas hadn't recently changed coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Jimmy Johnson were still there," Gogan said, "I would probably still be 
there. I think he would have been more supportive and would have tried to help 
me out. New Coach Barry Switzer couldn't do it because he doesn't know me. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cowboys wouldn't pay what other teams pay. Look at what Emmitt Smith had 
to do to get his money. This is what I had to do to get mine." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the Cowboys signed Gogan's replacement, New Orleans offensive 
lineman Derek Kennard, also an unrestricted free agent, to a one-year, $800,000 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the NFL gave Cowboy receiver Alvin Harper an extension of the midnight 
Monday deadline for signing an offer sheet with the Pittsburgh Steelers. The 
Cowboys have made Harper a one-year, $866,000 offer. The Steelers have offered 
$4.2 million for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 NFL Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Green Bay Packers signed Houston Oilerdefensive end Sean Jones to play 
opposite Reggie White, a free agent acquisition of Green Bay before last 
season. The team wouldn't release terms of the deal, but the contract 
reportedly is worth $7.8 million over three years. . . . . Bobby Hebert, 
allowed to become an unrestricted free agent by Atlanta, re-signed with the 
Falcons.. . . . Center Jim Sweeney agreed to a three-year, $3.7 million 
contract and will return for an 11th season with the New York Jets.. . . . 
Philadelphia Eagles return specialist Vai Sikahema retired.

COMMITTEE BACKS PLAN FOR AN O.C. SECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The CIF Section Relations Committee voted 6-0 Monday to recommend approval of 
an Orange County athletic section. 
</P>
<P>
 The motion to "offer an Orange County Section for any public or private school 
that so desires to enter the Orange County Section and that no school, public 
or private, be required to join that section" will be presented as a non-action 
item at the State Federated Council in May. It will be voted on at the 
council's fall meeting in October. 
</P>
<P>
 If a new section is approved, it could begin operations for the fall of 1995, 
according to Ed Seal, superintendent of the Brea-Olinda Unified School 
District. The section would consist of 80 schools if every school in the county 
joins. 
</P>
<P>
 The open-ended recommendation left it possible for the smaller private schools 
to remain in the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 13 schools in the county with enrollments between 45 and 720 
students. Officials from the smaller schools have expressed concerns about 
being forced into an Orange County Section. They felt that there were not 
enough schools of equal size to have a fair playoff format. 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller schools could remain in the Southern Section or be part of a 
two-section playoff format. Officials from both sections said that such a co-op 
playoff was a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei and Servite, two of the county's Catholic schools, also could decide 
to remain in the Southern Section. Officials from both schools said they would 
like to keep their options open. Santa Margarita, Orange County's other large 
Catholic school, did not have an official at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Resolutions from 13 of 15 county school districts have filed resolutions in 
favor of an Orange County Section. Anaheim Union School District and Fullerton 
Union School District have remained neutral, but Seal said he is confident the 
14 schools from those districts would be a part of the section.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom McCluskey, who has been an assistant at Saddleback the last two seasons, 
has been selected to be the men's basketball coach at Golden West, Albert 
Gasparian, Golden West athletic director, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 McCluskey will work in a walk-on position.He replaces Jim Greenfield, who had 
coached the men's program for the last 16 years. Greenfield requested at least 
two seasons off for personal reasons.  
</P>
<P>
 This will be the first time in 25 seasons that Greenfield hasn't been head 
coach of a basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 McCluskey, 32, played at Saddleback College and Penn State. He coached at 
Fontana High School for three seasons, then five seasons at Tustin High School. 
His Tustin teams had a record of 109-40 and won a State title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel it's a great opportunity," McCluskey said. "I hope I can take 
advantage of it. I'm excited to get it going." STEVE KRESAL

PROPERTY VALUES: BE CAUTIOUS IN STAGING A CONTEST TO GIVE AWAY A HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ron Galperin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Roth and Grace Reiner tried to sell their home for almost a year -- to 
no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, they've decided to try to get rid of their home by organizing a "contest" 
to give it away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't getting offers that we felt reflected the value of the property," 
said Roth, a Studio City attorney and former "Jeopardy!" TV show contestant. 
That's when he and his wife -- also an attorney -- came upon the idea of 
staging a contest. For $75, contestants get a list of questions to answer and 
the opportunity to win a 12-room, 3,000-square-foot home in the hills near 
Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth and Reiner aren't alone. Several other homeowners in the San Fernando 
Valley are contemplating similar contests. But before buying a ticket, be 
forewarned. There isn't a record of even one such successfully concluded 
contest in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roth/Reiner "Your Ticket to Hollywood" contest features 25 questions that 
Roth characterizes as "fun, offbeat and provocative." These include ones as 
basic as how long the ocean tour on "Gilligan's Island" was supposed to be, and 
another on whether the metal tip of a shoelace is called a tang, kerf, platen 
or aglet. The questions are designed to make the contest a legal test of skill 
versus an illegal game of chance. The top scorers who are tied will get a 
chance to match wits with additional tie-breaker questions until a winner is 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest ends June 30, or whenever a maximum of 12,500 entries are 
received, whichever comes first. If the minimum 7,500 entries is not received 
by June 30, the home will not be awarded. If the house is not given, the 
contest winner will be awarded three-fourths of all contest monies received, 
with the balance going to Roth and Reiner to defray the cost of creating and 
marketing the contest. Contestants can opt out of this so-called "collateral" 
drawing and get their money back -- provided they ask to do so in writing prior 
to June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 All this assumes, of course, that Roth and Reiner will get the minimum 7,500 
entries -- which would generate $562,500 -- needed before the couple give their 
home away. With only two months left before the contest is set to conclude, 
Roth reported that he has had only about 1,500 inquiries and an undisclosed 
number of actual paid entries. 
</P>
<P>
 He is optimistic, however, maintaining that an upcoming radio advertising and 
public relations blitz will attract plenty of contestants. There's even a 
toll-free number to call: (800) WIN HOUSE. Meanwhile, Roth said, he has cut a 
deal with a buyer of radio ads to pay no money now for the ads, only a share of 
the contest haul. Roth has also been running his own ads in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the home contest raises a number of legal and other questions. While the 
contest materials mention that the Roth home was appraised in December for 
$535,000, the materials don't mention that the home was listed for sale last 
year with Fred Sands Realtors in Studio City in the mid-$400,000 range. Even at 
that price, there were no buyers, Sands listing agent Geneal Arnoult recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 And the state attorney general's office has its own set of concerns about home 
contests. In California, games of skill are allowed by law, but games of chance 
are illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 In some other states, real estate "contests" are legal and a few have worked. 
One resident in Maine, who owned a bed-and-breakfast inn but wanted to get out 
of the business, set up an essay contest with a $100 entry fee. The Maine 
innkeeper pocketed $500,000 and picked the winning essay submitted by a couple 
who wanted to live in rural Maine and run their own business. 
</P>
<P>
 But in California, real estate "contests" are more of a gray area. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the attorney general charged a San Francisco company with unfair 
business practices and deceptive advertising in connection with two home 
giveaway contests in the Los Angeles area. The complaints were filed in Los 
Angeles Superior Court, along with settlement agreement in which CPM Property 
Marketing Inc. is forbidden from offering any essay contest or lottery to 
dispose of real estate, said Jerry Smilowitz, deputy attorney general in Los 
Angeles. The company had been offering a lottery contest for a home in Beverly 
Hills and an essay contest for another home in Cheviot Hills. The contests have 
been canceled and the money returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth was informed in November that the attorney general would not pursue him 
as long as "he is willing to offer entrants a right to have all monies returned 
in the event that the house is withdrawn as the prize." Even with the 
stipulation, Smilowitz said, "we're not thrilled about this. It's a speculative 
venture and people who want to get involved in it should do so with caution." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been very few successful contests around the country, Smilowitz 
said. And, he added, he doesn't know of one that has been successful in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The downside of home giveaways isn't enough to deter some homeowners who see a 
contest as the best way to unload their home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel a contest is better than putting our home up for sale and having 
nothing happen. I'm willing to take the gamble," said Sybil Casey, who owns a 
three-bedroom home in North Hills. "We've decided against putting it up for 
sale, especially with all the other homes on the market." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, Casey bought the home for $200,000. The only other home that 
recently sold in her small gated community recently went for $139,000. Casey 
hopes to sell 4,000 contest tickets for $100 each; if she does, she would gross 
$400,000 and turn a tidy profit on her home. She wants to relieve herself of 
the burden of homeownership and eventually move to the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 Haig Nashalian and his family are also considering a contest as an alternative 
to selling their three-bedroom home in Reseda. "The market is very soft and we 
thought a contest would be a very good way to get rid of the house," he said. 
He estimates that the house is worth about $150,000 -- which is also about the 
amount of money he owes on it. With a contest, he said, there is a possibility 
of still making a profit. "We're thinking about it and we're asking about how 
we can go ahead with it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Danielle Prange, who recently tried and failed to sell her North Hollywood 
home through a contest, advises would-be contest organizers to "try another 
option." Prange and her husband, Roy, organized an essay contest as an 
alternative to selling their four-bedroom residence on one acre near Coldwater 
Canyon Avenue and Roscoe Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Contestants were asked to send in $100 and an essay about why they want to 
live in North Hollywood. One of the letters in response came from the state 
attorney general, however. The AG said the contest was an illegal lottery 
because it was akin to a game of chance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pranges got just 200 inquiries, but only two entry essays. "People were 
afraid we were going to take their money and run," she said. Another problem, 
she said, was when some TV stations covered their contest, "it became a 
circus." The contest was canceled and the two essay writers got their money 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 The house is now for sale by owner for $300,000, down from the original asking 
price of about $450,000. Even with the big price cut, Danielle Prange is 
uncertain about the prospects for a fast sale. One recent offer was for just 
$170,000, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really want to get out of the house," she said. "But I can't sell it and I 
can't even give it away."

PANEL TO HEAR PLAN FOR HOMELESS CAMPGROUND; VENTURA: PRELIMINARY PROPOSAL FOR 
PERMANENT ENCAMPMENT WILL GO TO HOUSING COMMITTEE. BUT SOME DOUBT THE PROJECT 
WILL EVER WIN CITY OK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to entice some of the city's homeless people from their encampments on 
the Ventura River bottom and their sleeping bags in alleyways, Ventura 
officials are considering constructing a permanent campground for the homeless 
on the city's west side. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, we'd be putting people off the street into a central location 
where they can get services," said Maj. Eddie Patterson of the Salvation Army, 
one of the local charities working with the city on the housing proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials are unsure how much it will cost to run the project, they 
will present their preliminary plans to Ventura's housing committee Wednesday. 
Eventually, the proposal must be approved by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Loretta McCarty, a city planner who has worked on the project on and off since 
a former City Council member first mentioned it in 1991, said she is not sure 
whether city leaders will be enthusiastic enough about the project to fund it. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she said, planners and homeless advocates are anxious to push forward 
with the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarty said the city will need a vacant lot where about 25 families or 
individuals could set up camp in tents or vehicles and have easy access to job 
services, and alcohol and drug rehabilitation programs. Although several sites 
have been identified, officials declined to disclose the locations, saying they 
were still negotiating with the property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, at least one housing committee member, City Councilman Jack Tingstrom, 
said he likes the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to do something for the ones down there (in the river bottom) that 
desperately need our help," he said. "They need something to give them back 
some of their self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the city's homeless people, however, say the idea may not be popular 
with many of the 200 or more individuals living by the river or on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bet you less than 10% of the people who come through here would go for it," 
said Al Sanders, a homeless man who is trying to get his teaching credential. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these people have flat rejected society," Sanders said as he chatted 
with a friend at a local homeless charity's headquarters Monday afternoon. 
"They just won't deal with it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, though, Sanders said he'd be one of the first to sign up for the 
site. A former Ventura College student, Sanders, 44, said he dropped out of 
school and society's mainstream a few years ago when a drinking problem 
spiraled out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he said, he's sober, looking for work to pay off his school debt and 
sleeping either by the river or in a vacant site mid-town. "If you have no 
home, no phone and no car, it's three strikes and you're out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarty said that's part of the problem the project would attempt to solve. 
Currently, homeless families in Ventura can stay at the shelter run by Project 
Understanding, a local homeless aid organization, and homeless families and 
single women can stay at a Salvation Army shelter. But for single men like 
Sanders living in Ventura, there is only the outdoors and shuttered buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Under McCarty's plan, the city would set up two fiberglass, dome-like modules 
on a vacant lot, one that would hold administrative offices and one that could 
be a kitchen. The city and local charities could provide security and social 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those most intrigued by the idea, though, are skeptical that city leaders 
will ever seriously consider it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It surfaces from time to time," said Rick Pearson, executive director of 
Project Understanding. "But the overarching concern is political will." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Dycus, an unemployed man paying his rent, for the moment, with welfare 
money, was more blunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you set it up in town, people are not going to go for it," he said. "You 
know how people are with so-called undesirables. They will help them out to 
some degree, but they don't want to really solve their problems."

SCHOOL BOARD TO WEIGH SAFETY PROCEDURES; EDUCATION: A HOT LINE TO BRIEF PARENTS 
ON SUSPICIOUS SIGHTINGS ON CAMPUSES IS ONE OPTION THE PLEASANT VALLEY PANEL 
WILL DISCUSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As part of a broad effort to beef up campus security, Pleasant Valley school 
board members Thursday will consider new procedures to warn parents about 
suspicious characters hanging around campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the board will consider setting up a special telephone hot line 
that parents could call to get the latest information on suspicious sightings 
at district schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal comes on the heels of a plan to install new fencing at six 
schools to better control public access and improve safety. The fencing would 
funnel visitors toward each of the school's offices and prevent them from 
wandering around the campus unescorted, said Howard Hamilton, associate 
superintendent for administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board last month voted to allocate no more than $45,000 to install 
fencing at Los Primeros, Las Colinas, Los Nogales, Dos Caminos, Valle Lindo and 
Los Altos schools. The board is expected to award the construction bid at an 
upcoming meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The new security procedures would give formal guidance to principals on how to 
handle possible threats to student safety. Such rules are believed to be the 
first of their kind in the county, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton said the proposal stems from increasing violence perpetrated toward 
school-age children across the state and nation, as well as recent incidents 
involving children in the Camarillo district. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe it's better to be safe than sorry," Hamilton said. "Under this 
proposal, school principals would be given more guidance as to what to do 
should an incident or suspicious sighting occur." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton said principals now have the discretionary authority to simply make a 
note of an incident, alert their staffs and district staff members, or send a 
written advisory to parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed new policy is modeled more after standard police investigative 
procedures for any crime. Those procedures call for officers to investigate an 
incident, then give standards for deciding how serious the response should be. 
</P>
<P>
 Should police responding to a school incident decide that a crime had 
occurred, school principals would be directed to dispatch a written warning to 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Both parents and officials of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, which 
doubles under contract as the city's police force, applauded the proposal 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "A policy like the one they are considering would definitely head off a lot of 
potential problems," Sheriff's Cmdr. Ray Abbott said. "I think it will 
encourage awareness of the potential dangers that school-age children are 
facing. It's a good idea and one that the department is very supportive of." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Dennis Migliazzo, president of the Bedford Open School Parent 
Teacher Assn., said the proposal was one that the board should support. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sad reflection on the state of our society," Migliazzo said. "But I 
think it is definitely a step in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores (Val) Rains, a veteran Pleasant Valley school board member, said the 
proposal has a lot of merit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think parents have a right to as much information about the well-being of 
their child as is possible, and I think the hot line is an excellent idea," 
Rains said. "My only concern is the potential 'cry-wolf' problem that might 
come up, but I think we can find a way of working around that." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Pleasant Valley school board will meet at 7 p.m. Thursday at Camarillo 
City Hall, 601 Carmen Drive.

COSTS VERSUS SAFETY; OXNARD TO CONSIDER POLICE PLAN TO CUT BACK CROSSING GUARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard police officials want to eliminate five part-time school crossing 
guards and two mid-level managers so that they can promote two top 
administrators and hire a street cop to counsel junior high students about 
drugs and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, scheduled to be discussed today by the City Council, would also 
do away with four more crossing guards by July, 1995 -- a plan that some school 
officials and parents claim would threaten student safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen part-time crossing guards would be left to shuttle students safely 
across the streets of the county's most populous city if the council approves 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the staff changes, the Police Department restructuring would 
save almost $10,000 through June, and another $73,000 in fiscal year 1994-95. 
Subsequent annual savings would reach $94,000, according to Chief Harold L. 
Hurtt. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we did was review the areas where we're using crossing guards and see if 
they're really needed there," Hurtt said. "In some areas, there was really very 
little traffic connected to the schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the revisions would allow the department to better allocate its 
scarce resources. Investigations supervisor Tom Cady would be promoted from 
commander to assistant police chief -- duties Cady already performs, Hurtt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But school officials -- both public and private -- said they were concerned 
that fewer crossing guards could endanger young students walking to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel pedestrian safety is a function of the city, whether they are 
children or adults," said Sandra Herrera, an assistant superintendent with the 
Oxnard Elementary School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our overall focus is educating children once they get onto our campus," said 
Herrera, one of several school officials to complain about a similar plan 
rejected by the council last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Marian Clare, principal at St. Anthony's School in south Oxnard, said 
she believed that the recommendation to eliminate nine crossing guards was made 
before she was even consulted. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just said there's no money, we've got to do it someplace and it looks 
like yours is the corner that's got to go," said Clare, who described the 
intersection of Laurel and C streets as a main crossing for her 335 students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a major shopping center, a public park and two elementary schools" 
near St. Anthony's, Clare said. "It's incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Hurtt proposed that the Police Department get out of the crossing 
guard business and transfer that responsibility to the schools. But more than a 
dozen speakers persuaded the City Council to not approve the plan, saying 
schools could not afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the December proposal, Hurtt's new plan has not been billed as a public 
hearing. Instead, it will be considered as one of a number of items on the 
so-called "consent agenda," which typically consists of non-controversial 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's dangerous to cut the crossing guards because they're so crucial," said 
Danielle McFarland of Oxnard, who expressed the same concern at the December 
public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the way people around here drive, it's choosing (between) the kids' 
lives or the crossing guards," she said Monday. "I think the kids' lives are 
more important." 
</P>
<P>
 Cady said the youth services officer is needed to combat rising incidents of 
gang affiliation and drug use among adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're right at that critical age where you really need to be doing things 
to keep them out of getting on that track," he said. "A good positive police 
influence is a good way to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Cady said the youth services officer would be responsible for developing a 
series of educational and outreach programs to provide teen-agers with 
alternatives to gangs and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to begin offering these services at the junior high school level 
before they get to high school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With an annual budget of more than $19 million, the Oxnard Police Department 
employs about 245 people -- roughly 1.65 people per 1,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 But the number of sworn officers -- about 1 per 1,000 residents -- is fewer 
than any other police force in the county except Port Hueneme.

COLLEGE DISTRICT AND TEACHERS REACH PACT; EDUCATION: TENTATIVE AGREEMENT WOULD 
GIVE STAFFS AT THREE COUNTY CAMPUSES A 1% RAISE STARTING IN JULY. FINAL BOARD 
OK IS EXPECTED. 
</P>

<P>
 Negotiators for Ventura County's three junior colleges and the teachers who 
staff them have reached a tentative agreement on a salary package that will end 
a lengthy impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Hoffman, president of the union that represents about 900 teachers at 
Oxnard, Ventura and Moorpark colleges, said the bargaining representatives 
agreed to a 1% salary increase beginning July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "It also includes a formula that determines possible raises for faculty, 
depending on the income if there's an increase from the state," said Hoffman, 
who works as a counselor at Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly not as much as we'd hoped, but we've been in negotiations for 
over a year," said Hoffman, who added that the rank-and-file members would vote 
on the recommendation within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by teachers and district trustees, the contract would be the first 
for Ventura County Community College District teachers in almost three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-year pact covers fiscal years 1993-94 through 1996-97, Hoffman said. 
It includes language that would allow union negotiators to request further 
talks if the district receives more money from the state than anticipated, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The often-bitter negotiations included demonstrations, informational pickets, 
and harsh exchanges between faculty and district officials at meetings of the 
governing board. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chancellor Thomas Lakin said he was pleased that the lengthy process was 
seemingly coming to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hopeful that both the board and the teachers will accept what has taken 
us almost three years to negotiate," Lakin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of painful at times," he said. "But it was necessary because of 
the financial situation of the district and the position that was taken by the 
teachers union." 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers opened negotiations last year by requesting a 3% pay hike and an 
annual cost-of-living adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
 District negotiators scoffed at the request, saying the colleges could not 
afford such raises when they were forced to cut classes and other services to 
keep afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks dragged on through much of last year before a mediator was brought 
in to help reach an accord. But that did little good, and an impasse was 
declared late in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 After three months without any bargaining talks, trustees in February ordered 
the district negotiators to resume discussion with the union representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very difficult, but once the district came back to the bargaining 
table, then the process really began in earnest," Hoffman said of the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman said Monday that 1% would likely be approved by the rank-and-file 
members, considering the terms the district first proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came in a year ago wanting to cut a bunch -- salaries, benefits, 
everything," she said. "So this is definitely an improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Timothy Hirschberg said the tentative pact would help improve 
relations between teachers and district officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a start," he said. "I know this is a modest package. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all would like to have done better, and offered more. But the fiscal 
situation has been so bleak that we just can't commit to more." 
</P>
<P>
 The board of trustees will consider the salary package at its May 3 meeting or 
possibly at its June meeting, Lakin said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CITY MANAGER CALLS CLERK INEXPERIENCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard City Clerk Daniel Martinez is too inexperienced to efficiently run the 
clerk's office, and the City Council today should deny an automatic 5% pay 
raise that was deferred last year, City Manager Thomas Frutchey said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to the council to be discussed at today's meeting, Frutchey said 
Martinez lacks the ability and experience to administer the full duties of the 
city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 "In spite of high-quality staff in his department, the quality of the services 
and work products produced by the city clerk's department has in many cases 
been below acceptable standards," the report states. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite recommending against the 5% salary hike for Martinez's administrative 
work, Frutchey suggests that Martinez receive a raise of $150 to $450 a month 
to cover inflation for performance of his elected duties. 
</P>
<P>
 But Martinez said the report and subsequent recommendation to deny him a 
long-delayed pay raise are the result of a political backlash. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez beat out Mabi Plisky -- longtime clerk and wife of Councilman Michael 
A. Plisky -- in a hotly contested election in November, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't agree with (the recommendation), but staff is submitting it to 
council so it's up to the council to decide," said Martinez, who has asked for 
a meeting with Frutchey to more clearly define what is expected of him. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, the council delayed Martinez's scheduled 5% pay raise until 
Frutchey completed his performance review. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : SIMI VALLEY; HEARING WILL FOCUS ON ROAD EXTENSION

 A proposal to extend the Los Angeles County portion of Thousand Oaks Boulevard 
1,000 feet to the Ventura County line as part of the giant Ahmanson Ranch 
housing development will be the subject of a hearing today in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ahmanson Land Co. wants to extend Thousand Oaks Boulevard from Mountain 
Gate Drive in Los Angeles County across the Ventura County line, which would 
also require a permit to remove nine oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing on the issue is scheduled for 9 a.m. at the Hall of Records in 
downtown Los Angeles, said Richard Frazier, a regional planning official. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks Boulevard extension would be one of two main entrances to 
the Ahmanson development, which calls for 3,050 dwellings, two golf courses and 
400,000 square feet of commercial space to be built in the rolling hills 
southeast of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ahmanson project, approved by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors in 
December, 1992, has been stalled because of lawsuits filed by Los Angeles 
County and other jurisdictions that would be affected by the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine plaintiffs, including Los Angeles County and the cities of Los Angeles, 
Malibu and Calabasas, sued to reopen the environmental review process. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Ventura County judge March 4 upheld the Board of Supervisors' decision 
and ruled that the development's environmental impact report complied with all 
state guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Calabasas now plans to appeal the court ruling that favored the 
environmental review process used by Ventura County supervisors, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This process went forward without any reference to or concern for impacts on 
the city of Calabasas," Calabasas City Atty. Charles Vose said. "They barely 
even discussed the city. They talk about this as a regional issue, but the 
major portion of the traffic will go through Calabasas." Vose said he expects 
the other plaintiffs will file papers with the 2nd District Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson representatives have said Los Angeles County planning officials are 
trying to use the issue of the roadway extension to try to force Ahmanson to 
pay for more traffic improvements in the area that could run as high as $18 
million. CARLOS V. LOZANO and KURT PITZER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; GRANT CALLED VITAL TO MEDICAL OFFICE'S 
SURVIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Andrew Griffel walked among the temporary shells housing the Fillmore medical 
clinic Monday afternoon and was impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful how they were able to rebound so quickly," said Griffel, 
executive director of the American Jewish World Service, a New York-based 
foundation that donates money to needy relief organizations around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization donated $52,000 to help Clinicas del Camino Real reopen in 
temporary quarters after the Jan. 17 earthquake destroyed its downtown medical 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 The afternoon tour Monday convinced Griffel that the donation has made all the 
difference. "They managed to salvage all their records and some of their 
equipment, and they've turned it around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinicas del Camino Real operates four facilities in Ventura County to serve 
the area's poor and needy. It opened seven modular units in a park behind City 
Hall with the money it got from American Jewish World Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The other facilities, in Oxnard, Ojai and Saticoy, were undamaged in the 
earthquake. But the Fillmore structure was so badly destroyed that its 
directors feared that they could never afford to reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant from American Jewish World Service, which came last month, changed 
all that. 
</P>
<P>
 "It fills a gap that we are obviously going to have until we see some of the 
(federal) dollars coming in," said Jack Hinojosa, associate director of 
Clinicas del Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a financial standpoint, it gives us a little more breathing room," he 
said. "It helped us get over the hump." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffel said most of the projects that his organization chooses to fund are 
overseas. But when the earthquake struck Southern California, he began looking 
around for worthy groups at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (program) here seemed to have many of the criteria," he said. "We found 
they did excellent work and just decided to go for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinicas del Camino Real last year treated more than 60,000 patients at its 
four facilities, Hinojosa said. It saw another 70,000 people under a number of 
off-site medical programs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to see," he said, "not only from a financial standpoint, but to get 
some recognition for the work we've done for more than 22 years." JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; D. A. DROPS BATTERY CHARGE AGAINST MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County prosecutors agreed to drop a sexual battery charge against an 
85-year-old Oxnard man because the 20-year-old alleged victim had a "serious" 
credibility problem, a top district attorney's official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura woman had told police and district attorney's investigators that 
Victor Melilli fondled her Jan. 28 as she was working as a live-in helper in 
the man's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on her statements and police interviews with Melilli, prosecutors filed 
a single count of sexual battery against the man. But Melilli's attorney, 
Deputy Public Defender Shirley D. Lorenz, asked the district attorney's office 
to drop the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "They finally did the right thing," Lorenz said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Lela Henke-Dobroth said an ongoing Ventura police 
investigation surrounding allegations that the woman has stolen thousands of 
dollars from another senior citizen raises doubts about the woman's 
believability. Another elderly person had filed a complaint against the woman 
with the county's adult protective services office, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not saying that this man did not touch this woman in a sexual nature," 
Henke-Dobroth said. But she said it is hard to convict a defendant when the 
victim's credibility is in question. 
</P>
<P>
 Henke-Dobroth also said prosecutors initiated an investigation into the 
woman's background on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lorenz had said she brought it to prosecutors' attention. Lorenz, who had 
accused prosecutors of not thoroughly checking out the victim's background, 
stuck by her version of the story Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a true and accurate depiction that we file charges and sit on our 
duffs until the public defender's office say, 'Look at what we found?' " 
Henke-Dobroth said. But she added that prosecutors have "a good working 
relationship with . . . the public defender's office." DWAYNE BRAY

<P>
 An 18-year-old Thousand Oaks man was being held in Ventura County Jail on 
Monday night after being hit by a car while riding a stolen bicycle, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Maddens was riding the bicycle south on Hodencamp Road about 10 p.m. 
Saturday when he was struck by a car driven by 29-year-old Sheila Berger of 
Thousand Oaks, Ventura County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said Maddens had ridden through a stop sign at the Wilbur Road 
intersection when he was hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddens suffered a broken knee cap. He was treated at an area hospital and 
transferred to the County Jail infirmary, where he was being held on suspicion 
of possessing stolen property. His bail was set at $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 He is scheduled to be arraigned today in Ventura County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said the bike Maddens was riding had been reported stolen several 
weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the driver was not cited or held. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; COMMISSION TO STUDY DEVELOPER'S REQUEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of the Camarillo Planning Commission tonight will consider a request 
by Pardee Construction Co. to build 160 condominiums and 42 single-family homes 
on a 19-acre parcel on the city's east side. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members are recommending approval of the homes to be located near 
Mission Oaks Boulevard and Woodcreek Road. 
</P>
<P>
 But Matthew Boden, city director of planning and community development, said 
he also has concerns about excess noise from Mission Oaks Boulevard for homes 
on four lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Boden said staff is recommending that the commission ask Pardee to construct a 
wall and redesign some driveway entrances from Mission Oaks to help dampen 
noise. 
</P>
<P>
 The project must still be approved by the City Council because it has fewer 
homes than first planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Pardee Project Manager Bill Teller said the company opted to go with a lighter 
density development because of the surrounding neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just felt a less dense development worked better with the characteristics 
of that particular neighborhood," he said. "It's really a better fit." 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission will meet at 7:30 p.m. at City Hall, 601 Carmen Drive.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: AIDS CARE DIRECTOR ASKED TO STEP DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The executive director of AIDS Care was asked to leave his job after only 
three months due to "negative feedback from the community" and his inability to 
raise money for the nonprofit agency that supports area residents with AIDS or 
HIV, a board member said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifton Justice, 38, was asked to resign at the end of his three-month 
probation period because the seven-member board had major problems with his 
performance, board member Janet Nichol said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He agreed that it would be best for the organization if he left," Nichol 
said. "There were some good things he had done, but he did have trouble getting 
going raising money and interfacing with other agencies in the county. We were 
getting some negative feedback from the community." 
</P>
<P>
 But Justice, who left his job Friday, said he was fired because of 
"personality conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
 "They really didn't give me a reason," he said. "They said, 'It's just not 
going to work out.' I don't have another job, but I'm really glad I don't work 
there anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Justice said three months is too short a time to expect major fund-raising 
activities, and criticized the agency for being sloppy and disorganized. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I walked in, they had no idea what they had in the bank; they had 
numerous bills that were more than 90 days due," Justice said. "When I left on 
Friday, they had money in the bank and every bill paid." 
</P>
<P>
 Nichol said the board is looking for a replacement, but does not expect his 
departure to cause problems for AIDS Care operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice, who earned $32,000 a year, went to work for AIDS Care on Jan. 17, 
after he moved from Tulsa, Okla. Board members chose Justice, who was a 
theatrical director and fine arts administrator, for his fund-raising 
abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 He was hired to replace Edie Brown, who stepped down in the fall because she 
said she was unable to raise the funds the organization needed. Last year, the 
agency's budget was $300,000. PEGGY Y. LEE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY ISSUE CALIFORNIA LEARNING ASSESSMENT SYSTEM TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some educators have criticized the California Learning Assessment System test 
for asking math questions that are too hard and setting standards that are too 
high. They 
</P>
<P>
 also think that performances should be judged by comparing schools with each 
other rather than with preset standards. Which method do you think is 
appropriate? 
</P>
<P>
 * Alice Humbertson 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Council PTA member; mother of two children in public schools  
</P>
<P>
 I don't think there's anything wrong with being judged against tough 
standards. Those standards raise people's level of expectation and you get 
better performance. High performance is what you want,the best the students can 
possibly give. As far as the math questions being too difficult, from what I 
have seen, it reflects that there needs to be a change in the way teaching is 
being done. I see those two as very closely related. When I saw a sample of the 
math questions, I thought they were very difficult. At present, that's not the 
way the kids are taught. I think there needs to be a lot more emphasis on 
critical thinking, and I think it's going to take a long time for that to take 
place. It's what you hear the business community asking for in our graduates: 
Give us people who can think, people who can write. It's preparing them for the 
real world. One thing I think that is not so good about CLAS testing is that 
they are hand-scored. That takes a long time. It is also very expensive. I 
don't know how anyone can object to high performance standards.

 The more tests they take like these as they head toward college, the better. 
Because then they will already have experience taking a test in this format, 
which is similar to a college entrance exam. My interest is that the thinking 
skills will reflect the use of math to solve real-world problems, something 
they will find in the workplace. The curriculum now is emphasizing changes that 
are sweeping through the schools at all levels, particularly at the elementary 
school. They are moving from emphasis on number-crunching, or computations, to 
hands-on problem solving. They help students understand spatial, abstract 
concepts. If you want to teach a child how much carpet to put in a house, the 
old way would be to do some formulas and come up with a number. The new way is 
to take some pieces of paper and see if you can cut it up in the right pieces 
so they will fit into the rooms. These test results are not about blaming. This 
is saying we want to teach our students to a certain standard. We want them to 
be ready for the 21st Century.

 I think the CLAS test is excellent. I don't think the questions are too hard 
or that they are unrealistic. It's the first test that really gives us 
information that we, as educators, need. This test has kids not just doing 
computations, but they have to demonstrate pretty strong in-depth understanding 
of mathematical ideas. In my school, for example, we did well in reading and 
writing, but I was not thrilled with the math scores. And it is telling us we 
have a long way to go in reaching standards on math. When you compare against 
other schools, all it tells you is how you are doing against the other schools 
in California. Today, we are competing beyond California. We are competing with 
the world. We hear that American kids, when randomly tested, don't score well 
against kids internationally. We need to work harder. Some people are 
disappointed in the scores, but now we know where we are going. I have no doubt 
that statewide, and in our school district, they will get better. We will be 
giving kids something that is meaningful and worthwhile. 
</P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I think in one sense it would have been nice to be tested after having the 
materials and instructional strategies for a couple of years. That's what was 
done with the reading and writing, and that gave us a better picture of what is 
going on in the schools. The math scores look so negative because we weren't 
prepared. But teachers are now aware of what the questions will look like from 
now on and will gear their teaching strategies and material to that test. That 
is not teaching to a test. If you are being told you need good writing skills, 
then yes, you teach to that. If you are told you are going to be tested in 
math, not just with computations, but with extensive problem-solving, then yes, 
that is what you should be teaching children. What we are trying to teach are 
lifelong skills. I think we need to set high expectations, have high standards 
and shoot for that for all kids. On the other hand, with the problems that 
certain areas have with high poverty and things like that, then I think a 
comparison with other like areas is good because it's not such a dismal 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bernard Korenstein 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant superintendent for educational services, Oxnard Elementary School 
District * 
</P>
<P>
 I don't have a problem with the fact that the math questions are difficult, 
but I think our students should have been given the opportunity to be taught 
under that structure for a period of time before doing that assessment. The 
state should have introduced that concept and then allowed for lag time before 
giving that test. Most people think of math as computational skills. Our 
district is formulating a new test that will test more basic math skills . . . 
at the eighth-grade level. Our board is curious to know whether our children 
can do basic math. That is in direct reaction to the CLAS test. I don't think 
the CLAS test as a whole is a fair assessment of what a student may know if 
that student has recently transitioned into English instruction, because some 
of them didn't understand the questions. I didn't like the old state tests 
either. It doesn't give teachers any true assessment of how an individual 
student is doing. All it does is give a score for a grade level. It does not 
tell how a child is doing, and that is what a test is for. I hope that they 
improve upon it in the future.

BACK IN BOOKS; WITH LITTLE FANFARE, PATCHED-UP THOUSAND OAKS LIBRARY REOPENS 
FOR BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 With no fanfare except a brief burst of applause, the Thousand Oaks Library 
reopened Monday, as two dozen eager readers rushed through the sliding glass 
doors at 10 a.m. sharp. 
</P>
<P>
 Scurrying to snag favorite magazines or rummage through new fiction, most 
patrons barely glanced at the library's post-quake condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The bare concrete floor, patched and cracked, and the exposed metal girders, 
hung with industrial-sized lights, made no difference to residents overjoyed to 
see their library back in business. 
</P>
<P>
 They cared only about the bookshelves, magazine racks and children's puppet 
stacks -- and those were all full, befitting a library touted as the best in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said it wouldn't be pretty, but the books are there, and that's what's 
important," said Marie Reidy, who arrived a full hour before the doors opened, 
hoping to do some early morning research for a historical society project. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, hundreds of Thousand Oaks residents agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parking lot seems to be full, and everyone's glad we're open," Deputy 
Director Steve Brogden reported. For his staff, too, the reopening was a cause 
for celebration -- especially after months spent cleaning up or working in the 
cramped Newbury Park branch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Newbury Park is a wonderful place, but it's not built for the kind of 
workload it's been under. It's good to get back here," Brogden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aiming for business as usual, city staff decided to defer a major grand 
opening celebration until the fall, when the library will boast new carpet and 
decorative ceiling. A low-key party for children, featuring clowns and a bake 
sale, will welcome patrons from 10:30 a.m. to noon Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 But many children couldn't wait until the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 In the library by 10:15, 4-year-old David Richardson knew exactly what he 
wanted -- a plush green alligator puppet, a book on maps and a chance to play 
with the globe next to the children's circulation counter. 
</P>
<P>
 As he peppered his dad with cosmic questions -- if this planet suffers 
earthquakes, does Mars shudder through Marsquakes? -- David reveled in the 
spacious library reading room. 
</P>
<P>
 During the three months the library was closed, "I was very sad," David said. 
Although he went to the Newbury Park branch several times a week, "they don't 
have puppets over there," he added, hauling a footstool to the toy rack so he 
could reach the furry animals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newbury Park branch served as a stop-gap book source for many Thousand 
Oaks readers after the Northridge temblor knocked loose the main library's 
metal ceiling, forcing the long closure. 
</P>
<P>
 A few even found that they preferred the more intimate branch, such as 
sixth-grader Amy LaFata, who said, "I like a small library because it's a lot 
easier to find stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 But most avid readers said they were eager to return to the main library and 
its 290,000-volume collection, including videos, records and books on tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough without it," Larry Goldstein said as he waited to pick up some 
novels for his kids. "Every time we went to the other library and looked in the 
computers for a book, it would turn out to be located here." 
</P>
<P>
 While staff members said the Monday morning crowd wasn't quite as big as 
usual, the library was buzzing by lunchtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-grader Britney Seay was looking for a book on horses to keep her busy 
while she recuperates from the measles this week. And Joseph Estocko needed 
manuals to help him program a new computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, 10th-grader Joseph Brosamle headed straight for the reference desk 
to get help with a report on genetic engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 His family moved to Thousand Oaks just three months ago, after the earthquake 
rattled their Granada Hills home. And Joseph said he could not understand why 
anyone would complain about the library's lack of carpet and ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look how big this place is," his mother, Debbie Brosamle, agreed. "It's our 
first time in here, and it's real nice."

SUPREME COURT AGREES, STRATTON IS OUT OF ELECTION; APPEAL: JUSTICES UPHOLD 
PREVIOUS RULING THAT THE SIMI VALLEY MAYOR LACKS THE LEGAL QUALIFICATIONS TO 
RUN FOR AUDITOR-CONTROLLER ON THE JUNE 7 BALLOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court on Monday denied Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton's 
request to get his name restored on the June 7 ballot for Ventura County 
auditor-controller, removing one of the best-known and well-financed candidates 
from the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very frustrated," Stratton said of his disqualification. "I'm sorry for 
the public as much as I am for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton had asked the high court to overturn a judge's ruling last week to 
remove him from the auditor-controller race because he lacked the educational 
qualifications outlined in a 37-year-old law. The decision was upheld by the 
2nd District Court of Appeal, and Stratton took his case to the state Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 But his hopes of reinstatement were dashed late Monday afternoon when the high 
court issued a one-sentence order denying Stratton's petition for appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said they were pleased that the issue had been resolved 
because printing of 350,000 sample ballots without Stratton's name had already 
started. Officials ordered the printing to begin over the weekend to meet a 
state-mandated deadline to get the sample ballots out to voters for review 
before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy because it means that the county doesn't have to pay to have the 
ballots reprinted" with Stratton's name, said Robert Orellana, assistant county 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 William Baker, a certified public accountant and one of five candidates for 
auditor-controller, filed a lawsuit last month challenging Stratton's 
qualifications for the job. Baker said he was not surprised by the court's 
decision Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no doubt in my mind Mr. Stratton was not qualified to run for the 
auditor-controller position," he said. "As far as I'm concerned, his accounting 
experience was none." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Baker said he hoped that his challenge showed "that I'm not afraid to stick my 
neck out." He said he spent $5,000 to file the challenge in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Thomas O. Mahon, appointed incumbent auditor, said his chances of 
holding on to his seat were boosted with Stratton out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to work toward my benefit," Mahon said. "Let's be honest; he was a 
very strong candidate, the mayor of a city with lots of name recognition in the 
east county. On the other hand, I can't help feel some degree of sorrow for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates in the race include accountants Richard Morrisset and Scott 
Weiss of Ventura and Clifford Wigen of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for county auditor, state law dictates that a candidate must either 
be a certified public accountant, have served as county auditor-controller or 
deputy auditor for at least three years, or possess a certificate or diploma 
from a school of accountancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there are no more schools of accountancy in California, Stratton 
argues that his master's degree in business administration -- including 14 
units in accounting -- should be sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his ruling last week, Superior Court Judge William Peck said that while 
Stratton might have a strong background in accounting and business 
administration, he nevertheless did not meet the literal requirements for the 
job as outlined in the 1957 law. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton said that he believes the law needs to be clarified and that he may 
take up the issue with state legislators in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it interesting that you can be state controller without a CPA, but you 
can't be a county controller," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Stratton said he might consider running as a write-in candidate, 
county officials said that because a judge had ruled he was ineligible, he 
would probably be prevented from doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton said that his candidacy had just started to get rolling, and that he 
had already raised more than $10,000. He said running for reelection for mayor 
in November was still an option. But then again, he said, so is taking time off 
from political life. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are worse things than not running for political office," he said.

PARENTS KEEP CHILDREN AT HOMEIN PROTEST OVER NEW STATE TESTS; THOUSAND OAKS: 
THEY SAY 'PSYCHOLOGICAL' NATURE OF QUESTIONS ON THE CLAS EXAM VIOLATES 
STUDENTS' PRIVACY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS and JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About two dozen Thousand Oaks parents kept their children out of school Monday 
morning to prevent them from taking a new state assessment test that opponents 
claim violates students' privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly 425 fourth-grade students at six schools in the Conejo Valley Unified 
School District were scheduled to begin this year's round of the California 
Learning Assessment System exams Monday. Some of the schools took practice 
tests, while others began the actual exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other standardized assessment tests that rely on multiple-choice and 
true-false questions, CLAS emphasizes writing, asking students to explain how 
they arrived at particular solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials have hailed CLAS -- used last year for the first 
time -- as a revolutionary method for assessing how well children think rather 
than just measuring what they know. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is precisely the subjective nature of many of the questions on CLAS 
that bothers many conservatives in Thousand Oaks and around the state who 
oppose the test. Among them is former state Assembly candidate Alan Guggenheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a psychological test, not an academic test," said Lori Fiore, president 
of the Parent-Faculty Assn. at Maple School in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, at three of the schools, parents protested the tests by keeping 
their children home. 
</P>
<P>
 Protest organizers said they expect more parents to join the boycott of the 
CLAS exam as the rest of the district's schools begin to administer this year's 
version of the test later this week and through the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 And parents in at least two other school districts, Oak Park and Simi Valley, 
are organizing to keep their children out of school when the test is given in 
their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, activists against CLAS include school board member Mildred 
Lynch, who spoke at a protest meeting Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires school districts to give the CLAS exam and for students to 
take it. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents opposed to the test said their only recourse was to keep their 
children home while the test was being given -- a potentially costly action for 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The district loses about $17 in state funds each day a student is absent. But 
it usually gets full funding if the student attends at least part of a school 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Many CLAS opponents took their children to school after the testing was over 
Monday morning. And district officials said they believe that the extent of the 
protest is still relatively small. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's significant and a concern," Supt. Jerry Gross said. "But it's not a 
dramatic problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Launched statewide last spring, the CLAS exams are given to fourth-, eighth- 
and 10th-grade students in reading, writing and math. This year for the first 
time, a CLAS exam in science and social science will also be given to 
fifth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 At Maple School, roughly 65 fourth-graders were scheduled to take the CLAS 
test Monday morning. But parents of 10 of the students kept their children home 
while the test was being given. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspen School officials reported that about five of the school's 35 
fourth-graders scheduled to take the test Monday were kept home by parents 
opposed to the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 And at Wildwood School, parents said at least seven fourth-grade students 
stayed home either the entire day or during the morning when the exam was 
given. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At three other elementary schools where either actual or practice CLAS exams 
were given Monday -- Ladera, Weathersfield and Westlake Hills -- officials said 
no parents intentionally kept their children from taking the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many parents who kept their children home in the morning took the 
students to school in the afternoon, some parents said they planned to keep 
their children home all week while the test is being given to punish the 
district financially. 
</P>
<P>
 "If so few kids take the test, they will lose their funding," said parent Mike 
Bell, who kept his daughter, a fourth-grader, home from Wildwood School on 
Monday. "That's the goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents who sent their children to school for the exams Monday called 
school officials to complain about being harassed over the weekend with phone 
calls and flyers from protesters urging a boycott of the exam, Gross said. He 
added that some parents reported receiving anti-CLAS literature at church. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had parents calling schools to complain about this group that's 
harassing them to keep their kids home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, organizers said they were merely trying to alert parents about the 
content of the test. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents who found out and were outraged by what kind of test it was felt that 
they should inform other parents," said Suzanne Guggenheim, parent of a 
fourth-grader at Maple and an organizer of an anti-CLAS group called Concerned 
Parents and Educators. "Calling that harassment is very, very strong wording." 
</P>
<P>
 Guggenheim and her husband, Alan, are conservative Republicans who are both 
running for the Ventura County Republican Central Committee. But she said they 
are keeping that campaign separate from the protest against CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem with the test, opponents say, is that it asks students to give 
their responses to stories, which critics say intrudes into the students' 
personal lives. 
</P>
<P>
 On last year's test, for example, 10th-graders read a short story by Alice 
Walker and then had to write and draw pictures giving their feelings, thoughts 
and opinions about the story. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're forcing students to reveal parental values and beliefs without the 
parents' permission," said Stacy McAuliffe, who kept her fourth-grade daughter 
home from Wildwood School on Monday morning and also cared for two other 
children of parents who didn't want them to take the exam. "Their essay tests 
and their stories, I feel, undermine family values and religion." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because of such concerns, state officials have dropped the word feelings from 
this year's exam, said William L. Rukeyser, spokesman for the state Department 
of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Rukeyser said, the test asks open-ended questions to assess whether 
students really understand what they read. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to concerns about the subjectivity of the questions, there have 
also been protests around the state about some of the content of the test, such 
as the Alice Walker short story. Parents have objected that some of the stories 
are too depressing and violent for students. 
</P>
<P>
 Even many school officials and parents who support CLAS said they think that 
the test needs to be improved. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross, for example, said he has asked the state to consider using less 
controversial literary excerpts. "Some of the stories tend to raise concerns 
that tend to draw attention away from what CLAS was designed to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gross said he has urged protesters to take their complaints directly to 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state's developed a new test," he said. "There are obviously some 
problems with it. We've got to give them a chance to work them out." 
</P>
<P>
 And, he added: "I'm very upset that they're up here beating up on the 
districts. We're obeying state law."

* RUSS SMITH; DIRECTOR OF VENTURA VISITORS BUREAU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russ Smith, executive director of the Ventura Visitors & Convention Bureau, 
died of a heart condition Monday. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
 As head of the convention bureau, Smith spearheaded efforts to lure visitors 
to the seaside town for the past 10 years. Before he helped create the bureau 
in 1984, Smith was promotional director at the Buenaventura Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 His absence will be a real loss to the community and the tourist industry, 
Mayor Tom Buford said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was valuable; he knew how to get things done," Buford said. "He believed 
that this was truly a place where we could have tremendous success as a tourist 
spot." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was an enthusiastic promoter of Ventura, said Russ Lovell, a friend who 
knew him for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the salesperson to sell Ventura," Lovell said. "He was selling a 
product he believed in." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Hobbs, marketing director for the Doubletree Hotel, said Smith was 
especially good at helping city officials realize the importance of the tourist 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's brought the city a long way," Hobbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the City Council last year decided to reduce funding to the bureau by 
$42,200, Smith was there to fight for the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we cut the budget, we're self-defeating. We don't want to cut off the 
source of revenues," said Smith, who at the time boasted that the city received 
$1.7 million in hotel bed taxes in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio. He graduated from Ohio State 
University in 1955 with a bachelor's degree in business administration and 
worked in various retail-related jobs in Arizona before moving to California in 
1974. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, Smith moved from Woodland Hills to Ventura to become promotional 
director for the Buenaventura Mall, the largest shopping center in the area at 
the time. He stayed there until 1984, when the convention bureau was formed. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith suffered from a congenital heart condition known as Wolff Parkinson 
White Syndrome. His physician, Douglas Wilkinson, said the disease accelerated 
Smith's heart rate several times a year. His death was unexpected, Wilkinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is survived by his wife, Karmen. Funeral services are scheduled for 2 
p.m. Thursday at Joseph P. Reardon Funeral Home.

ATTORNEY SAYS SLAIN YOUTH PROVOKED FIGHT; SIMI VALLEY: PHILLIP HERNANDEZ'S 
PUBLIC DEFENDER CHARGES THAT CHAD PATRICK HUBBARD, 14, HAD BEEN DRINKING THE 
DAY OF THE STABBING. 
</P>

<P>
 Chad Patrick Hubbard, the popular 14-year-old who was fatally stabbed by a 
younger classmate two months ago, had been drinking and provoked the fight at a 
Simi Valley school that culminated in his death, a public defender said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the end of day, his blood-alcohol level was 0.06(%)," said Deputy Public 
Defender Donna Forry, who represents Phillip Hernandez, the boy charged with 
Chad's murder, who went on trial Monday in Juvenile Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. James D. Ellison agreed that Chad started a fistfight with 
Hernandez, but said that still does not justify murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minor (Hernandez) took a folding knife and plunged it into the chest of 
Chad Hubbard," Ellison told the judge. "It pierced his heart, and Chad Hubbard 
died as a result." 
</P>
<P>
 The attorneys' statements in Ventura County Superior Court preceded a full day 
of testimony from Valley View Junior High School friends of the victim and 
defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Hubbard, Chad's mother, confirmed that her son had been drinking prior 
to the incident. But she said his blood-alcohol level was 0.04%, not 0.06%. 
</P>
<P>
 "He definitely was drinking. Someone had given him something to drink. Two 
girls had brought it to school. It was not an everyday thing," the mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 She blamed school officials for the stabbing incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, Chad should have been suspended for drinking at school," she 
said. "And second, he shouldn't have been murdered at school." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Unified School District Supt. Mary Beth Wolford declined to 
respond to the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many teen-age classmates, called to testify about the bitter relationship 
between the two boys, appeared uncomfortable on the witness stand, fidgeting 
and answering questions with a shrug of the shoulders. On several occasions, 
Judge Allan Steele ordered them to sit closer to the microphone or raise their 
voices. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez is charged with a single count of murder in Chad's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Five students testified Monday that the two boys had been embroiled in a 
running feud for several weeks before the Feb. 1 stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
 They generally described the larger and stronger Chad as the aggressor. But 
they also said that Hernandez, 13 at the time of the stabbing, was a willing 
participant in several pushing matches with his foe. 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening statement, Ellison said the prosecution will show that Chad and 
Hernandez's dislike for one another grew in intensity up to the day of the 
stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that Chad struck Hernandez with a closed fist at least two 
times before the defendant pulled out the folding knife. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense plans to prove that Hernandez had no malicious intent when he 
stabbed the victim. Forry said Hernandez was just tired of being harassed by 
Chad. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Chad had been drinking alcoholic beverages since his first class that 
day. Before the stabbing, he had confronted Hernandez three times, either 
flashing signs to indicate that he would shoot the defendant or just following 
him around, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth time that Chad approached Hernandez, Forry said, "he was pushing 
Phillip, saying things to Phillip. . . . Finally Chad pulled off his jacket and 
was saying, 'I need to straighten this fool out.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Forry said Hernandez stabbed the victim "in an effort to stop Chad from 
severely hurting him." 
</P>
<P>
 About a week before the stabbing, right after the school reopened following 
the Northridge earthquake, Chad and Hernandez got into a confrontation on the 
athletic field, witnesses testified. They gave each other dirty looks and 
started pushing one another as their friends tried to separate them, according 
to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 That incident, which started after Hernandez had thrown a football toward a 
basketball court where Chad and some others were playing, was the last 
confrontation before the stabbing, witnesses testified. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was also during that incident that Chad accused Hernandez of stealing his 
baseball cap, a charge that Hernandez staunchly denied, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the pushing incident, the two boys were successful in staying clear of 
one another for a week, said Eric J. Albertson, one of Chad's best friends. "In 
my opinion, I thought it sort of mellowed out," Albertson told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Albertson also conceded that Chad had a decided advantage over Hernandez in a 
fistfight because of his athleticism and strong build. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was not the kind of boy you'd want to get into a fight with, was he?" 
Forry asked him under cross examination. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," the boy replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Candice Brewer, an eighth-grader, said Hernandez had showed her a knife days 
before the stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chad thought he called him a punk," she said. "Phillip said he didn't call 
him a punk." 
</P>
<P>
 But she said Hernandez did not seem eager to fight Chad. She was asked why she 
believed that. "Because he's smaller, and I just think that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Terry, another eighth-grader who was Chad's friend, said Hernandez had 
promised to kill Chad if Chad did not stop pushing him around. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said it had become a common occurrence for students at the school to 
see the two confronting each other. During the pushing incident on the athletic 
field, she said, "my friends go, 'Oh, no, there goes Chad and Phillip again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most dramatic testimony came from Eduardo Bedolla, a friend of 
Hernandez's who said he tried to stop Chad from confronting Hernandez before 
the stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After school that day, Eduardo, Hernandez and a third boy were stopped three 
times by Chad before they could reach their school bus, Eduardo said, adding 
that each time, Chad challenged Hernandez to a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, near the bus stop, Chad came up and punched Hernandez in the chest, 
he said. Hernandez, he said, did not fight back. 
</P>
<P>
 Eduardo said he grabbed Chad but released his grip after Chad promised that he 
would leave and not hit Hernandez again. Instead, Chad took another swing at 
Hernandez, who had the knife in his hand and stabbed Chad, Eduardo testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad immediately fell to the ground, Eduardo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when Phillip ran," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial, expected to last throughout the week, continues this morning with 
more testimony from juvenile witnesses.

 The Thousand Oaks theater commission has considered banning heavy metal and 
rap music concerts from the new Arts Plaza out of concerns over attracting 
"hordes of sometimes rowdy teen-agers." 
</P>
<P>
 Any rendition of Ravel's "Bolero" brings to mind, among other things, the 
vision of Dudley Moore scrambling to engage in out-of-wedlock sex with Bo Derek 
in the movie "10." 
</P>
<P>
 Can the commissioners envision the day when overzealous fundamentalists 
petition them to ban classical music because of how it can inspire some to 
engage in demonic fornication? 
</P>
<P>
 Get with it. This is America. That teen-agers are not yet old enough to 
protect themselves via the voting booth does not give the commission the 
authority to suggest which form of artistic expression should grace their 
precious "elegant concert hall" and which should not. The hall belongs to the 
city, therefore, the people.

CABLE PROGRAMMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was surprised to read the opinions of Oxnard's Telecommunications Task Force 
regarding the performance of Jones Intercable and its community access 
programming ("Panel Says Cable Firm Broke Its Promises," April 1). 
</P>
<P>
 As a board member of the Oxnard Peace Officers' Assn., I have worked closely 
with Jones over the past four years on the set of "Street Beat" and have also 
produced a variety of public service announcements. 
</P>
<P>
 My last experience was putting together a public service announcement for 
Pride Bowl XII. With only six days notice, for five hours on the Sunday before 
the game, the community access coordinator and her staff put together a 
30-second spot and aired it that week. Other spots that Jones has donated air 
time for over the last couple of years include the 1994 Dave & Bob Talent Show, 
benefiting Special Olympics (aired 599 times); the 1993 talent show (1,751 
times); the OPOA's Christmas tree lot, benefiting the memorial funds for those 
killed at the EDD office (177 times), and the Cops and Jocks anti-drunk-driving 
campaign (317 times). At $25 per 30-second spot, just these four examples 
equate to $71,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Silvia Gallardo, Jones' full-time community access coordinator. She will 
tell you how many times the company has been approached about airing locally 
produced educational programs -- the answer is once, and the teacher got on the 
air. Ask John Hatcher of the NAACP about community access. His show, "What's 
Going On," is on every Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Community access programming is available to Oxnard, but someone has to put 
forth the effort to put a program on the air.

LANDFILL THREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would like to suggest that all those hysterical souls, who by rumor and 
innuendo are whipping themselves and the Ojai Valley into a fear-driven frenzy 
over the weather radar tower on Sulphur Mountain, direct their considerable 
energies toward battling a true and distinct danger that may again be 
threatening our relatively pristine valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the Easter holiday, the Weldon Canyon landfill rose from the dead to 
bedevil us once again.According to The Times, Taconic Resources of San Diego 
County plans to put a countywide initiative on the November ballot authorizing 
construction of the landfill. To get the initiative on the ballot, Taconic 
Resources must collect 18,000 valid signatures by June 8. 
</P>
<P>
 With 98.5% of potential voters living outside Ojai, we can expect little help 
and / or sympathy from other sections of the county, where residents see little 
to be lost by authorizing the dumping of their trash in our airshed. In truth, 
with more than a little justification, many in the county consider us elitists 
unwilling to share in the problems that confound the entire county. 
</P>
<P>
 The loud protests of those opposed to the weather radar installation do little 
to gain the support of the voters we will need to counter the rebirth of Weldon 
Canyon -- a true and proven threat to life in the Ojai Valley as we know it.

SHULTZ IS CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT CLINTON'S POLICY ON BOSNIA WAR; SIMI VALLEY: 
THE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, SPEAKING AT REAGAN GOVERNMENT CENTER, CALLS THE 
ADMINISTRATION INEPT IN HANDLING THE TURMOIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Secretary of State George P. Shultz blasted President Clinton's policy 
in Bosnia on Monday at a conference at the Ronald Reagan Center for Public 
Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neville Chamberlain step aside, we have a new nominee for No. 1 diplomat," 
Shultz said, referring to the former British prime minister's appeasement of 
Adolf Hitler following Germany's invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
 Shultz's off-the-cuff remark came at the end of a passionate response he was 
giving to a question on U. S. involvement in Bosnia. He called the Clinton 
Administration inept in its attempts to resolve the religious war in Bosnia, 
now nearing the end of its third year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't seen anything like this since Hitler's day," he said. "I have a 
sense of shame that we haven't done anything effective." 
</P>
<P>
 Shultz was the keynote speaker at the conference, titled "The Perils of 
Democracy." Billed as an event as much for political novices as for academics, 
it was the first major event staged by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library's 
new director, Richard Norton Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hundred people paid the $20 fee for admission and lunch, and about 20 
college students from around Southern California were invited to a private 
luncheon with Shultz and featured speaker Andrezj Olechowski, Poland's minister 
of foreign affairs. A library spokeswoman said Reagan did not attend because of 
a scheduling conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since the library and the Ronald Reagan Center for Public Affairs housed there 
opened in November, 1991, the facility has struggled to decide what national 
role it should play. Smith, a historian and past director of the Herbert Hoover 
Presidential Library who took over the director's job in December, has said he 
would like to make the center less of a think tank and more accessible to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, today demonstrates the validity of that goal," Smith said, "that 
you can have an intellectually substantive discussion that is not exclusively 
the province of academics." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith called the conference a success. 
</P>
<P>
 "No glitches," he said. "Only good things, happy people and the lively clash 
of ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 But there was little clashing as both featured speakers embraced the Reagan 
legacy. A question-and-answer period following the lectures yielded few 
questions; many audience members seemed more interested in getting snapshots of 
themselves with Shultz. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith introduced Shultz as the architect of the Reagan doctrine and a key 
component in the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Shultz began his speech by taking lighthearted exception to the conference 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little bit more optimistic than that title suggests," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His speech ran the gamut from a discussion of Reagan Administration policies 
in Chile, South Korea and the Philippines to suggestions on how the present 
Administration should encourage change in China. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can think of a lot more effective ways to go about it than what's happening 
now," Shultz said. "I like the way Ronald Reagan did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Olechowski spoke about the fall of communism in Poland and his country's 
struggle to move to democracy. He read from the speech Reagan gave the day the 
Solidarity movement won power in Poland, and told the audience that it 
encouraged him to look to the United States for inspiration and assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want you to deliver on Ronald Reagan's promise that we stand as one," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Olechowski made several references to Poland's attempts to join NATO, and said 
he hoped that the United States would push for its inclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience included local business people, financial supporters of the 
library and local educators. Simi Valley Unified School District Supt. Mary 
Beth Wolford attended and brought Sequoia Junior High history teacher Beth 
Cohen with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said she planned to work Monday's conference into her lesson plan for 
her eighth-grade class. She had already informed her students about the 
speakers and their roles in history. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a wonderful opportunity," she said. "For them to know about the 
accessibility of our leaders is really wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 The library is planning another conference May 17 entitled "Do Conservatives 
Have a Sense of Humor?" Former Vice President Dan Quayle is expected, as well 
as author P. J. O'Rourke. That conference is also open to the public.

GIVE FIRE DEPT. PARAMEDIC RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We, the residents and employees (more than 350 residents and 200 employees) of 
the Ventura TowneHouse and the Venturan Convalescent Center, support the 
proposition that the Ventura Fire Department be allowed to provide paramedical 
services to our community. 
</P>
<P>
 There isn't a week that goes by that we do not have to call 911 for paramedic 
emergency services for our residents.Our Fire Department responds within five 
minutes to provide emergency medical services. But it takes the ambulance 
company 10 to 15 minutes to arrive. Those few minutes difference may be a 
matter of life or death for our residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, why dispatch two separate organizations when one could perform the task 
efficiently and transport the resident to the local hospital at the same time? 
It must be costing the city a substantial amount to provide emergency services 
by the Fire Department, and the ambulance company gets reimbursed by Medicare, 
private insurance companies or the individual. The average cost that the 
ambulance company charges our residents for the two-mile trip to the hospital 
is more than $600. If the City Council allows the Fire Department to provide 
this service, then the city would be able to recover its cost by billing the 
above groups.

COMMUNITY CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have been a small business owner and resident of the Thousand Oaks-Westlake 
Village area since 1990. My family and I moved here for one major reason: We 
felt that it was a community with the highest values placed on family, open 
space and education. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I am worried about what is happening around me. We have allowed things to 
change our beautiful community because we haven't spent the time to show we 
care enough. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't help but see more and more reasons to leave this area. Every time I 
look around, I see a bigger building being approved for smaller land. First, it 
was the Circuit City temple, something that could have been half the size it 
is. Then it was the Civic Arts Plaza, a monstrosity. 
</P>
<P>
 This came to a head for me recently while I was watching the Planning 
Commission on Channel 10 approve 45 townhomes on 3.5 acres of building space on 
Hillcrest Drive. The decision was made at 12:30 a.m. on a 3-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 I think it's gone far enough. We are allowing other people to make emotional 
decisions for our families instead of making logical decisions for our future. 
If we don't get more involved today in what is happening in our community, 
there won't be a community left to worry about.

RV PARK, POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The citizens of Port Hueneme recently received a letter from Citizens to 
Protect Port Hueneme's Future. Part of the letter says that unless we pull 
together to support the RV park, the city will not be able to fund the Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 But the RV park's proposed income and the Police Department funding are two 
totally different issues. The city has plans to put police funding to a vote on 
an upcoming ballot, whether the RV park is approved or not. The city has never 
stated that any income from the RV park would fund the Police Department. And 
don't you think that up to 100 RVs in our community on a daily basis might mean 
an increase in police costs, or a decrease in protection per capita? 
</P>
<P>
 The letter says that NIMBYs (Not in My Back Yard) are strangling the city's 
ability to flourish. The only thing strangling this city is the 
propaganda-pushing, bad-business managing, tax-wasting members of our City 
Council. This same City Council insisted that the cultural center could be 
profitable and pushed for it to be built. Well, it's been closed nearly a year 
after running in the red for years. Now it stands there empty and useless, and 
obviously not bringing in the big bucks the council promised. 
</P>
<P>
 And this same City Council has invested more than $1 million and four years 
trying to push this RV park on one of the nicest beaches in the county.

POLICE ARREST 6 ON DRUG CHARGES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard police arrested a 60-year-old Oxnard man on drug charges and five 
alleged accomplices after completing a six-month investigation of a large 
cocaine trafficking organization, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Lopez was arrested in South Gate on Saturday afternoon after he tried 
to sell a kilogram of cocaine to undercover detectives, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the investigation, search warrants were served at Lopez's house on J 
Street, as well as on houses in the cities of South Gate and Bellflower. 
Investigators said they found $438,000 in cash at a Bellflower residence, and 
seized three vehicles, six handguns, three assault rifles and a sawed-off 
shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 The other suspected drug traffickers arrested were Marino Cavada, 47, and Ives 
Enciso-Arellano, 25, both of South Gate; Hector Cabrerra, 39, of Los Angeles, 
and Jesus Padilla, 39, and Nohemi Zazueta, 25, both of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 All were being held at Los Angeles County Jail, police said. PEGGY Y. LEE

 Ron Vawter, avant-garde stage actor seen in such mainstream films as 
"Philadelphia" and "Silence of the Lambs" but best remembered for a one-man 
show about two opposites on the issue of homosexuality, has died. He was 45. 
</P>
<P>
 Vawter, who had suffered from AIDS since 1991, died of a heart attack Saturday 
while flying from Zurich to New York, his agent, Philip Carlson, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor, who lived in New York's Greenwich Village, had been performing a 
play about Sophocles in Brussels, Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vawter was recently seen as a colleague of Academy Award-winner Tom Hanks, who 
portrayed an attorney dying of AIDS in "Philadelphia." Vawter's stentorian 
voice earlier earned him roles as a psychiatrist in "sex, lies and videotape," 
as hero Andy Garcia's boss in "Internal Affairs" and as a Justice Department 
official in "Silence of the Lambs." 
</P>
<P>
 "I generally get to play these Establishment types who have some sort of 
corruption of the soul," Vawter said in a Times interview in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But he earned his greatest critical reviews for the one-man show "Roy 
Cohn/Jack Smith." The show, for which Vawter won an Obie award, was about Cohn, 
a lawyer who worked for redbaiting Sen. Joseph McCarthy, and Smith, a New York 
performance artist. Cohn denied being homosexual but Smith flaunted it, and 
both died of AIDS in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Vawter did the show at the Museum of Contemporary Art's Ahmanson Auditorium in 
Los Angeles in 1992, as well as in New York, San Francisco, and cities in Ohio 
and Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were both products of a society who continually told them that what they 
were, in the very depth of their being, was bad, wrong, immoral, twisted. It's 
little wonder they grew up warped," Vawter said of Cohn and Smith. "I'm always 
amazed that we homosexuals are doing as well as we are. Despite those signals 
from society, whatever is there is going to come out, either in a healthy way 
or in a destructive way. I just pray to God that it will be positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Born to a military family in Albany, N.Y., Vawter enlisted in the Army on his 
17th birthday and set out to become a chaplain for the Green Berets. But after 
studying theology and literature, he became an Army recruiting officer in New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving into acting in the late 1970s, he helped his new colleagues found the 
Wooster Group, the experimental theater collective which spawned such 
performers as Spalding Gray and Willem Dafoe.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; ANDY STEWART MAKES YOU WISH YOU'D BEEN THERE; THE SCOTTISH 
FOLK SINGER, JOINED BY GUITARIST GERRY O'BEIRNE, GIVES A PERFORMANCE IN ANAHEIM 
FULL OF A HUMOR AND INTIMACY ALIEN TO THE STADIUM SCENE.

<P>
 In this season of high-ticket, superstar concert tours, something as quiet and 
low-profile as traditional folk music is apt to strike the vast majority of the 
music-loving public as quaint, dull and beside the point. 
</P>
<P>
 Funny thing, though: When Pink Floyd, the first in a succession of 1994 
blockbuster touring attractions, brought its computerized, laser-filled stadium 
spectacular to San Diego on Thursday, the only moment of genuine, spontaneous 
humanity rose from a return to simple, traditional folk roots. 
</P>
<P>
 It came during the haunting, Brit-folk inspired acoustic guitar intro to the 
Floyd oldie "Wish You Were Here." With no other accompaniment, leader David 
Gilmour and sideman Tim Renwick intertwined gleaming, meditative guitar lines 
for a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 When the passage was finished, Gilmour paused, turned to Renwick, and issued a 
broad smile that seemed to be his only unrehearsed response of the whole 
extravaganza. Never mind the lasers, the fireworks, the high-tech props and the 
crowd of 50,000. It took the intimacy and simplicity of a folk moment for the 
man at the center of it all to be openly delighted by what he was doing, and to 
show himself to be more than a cog in an elaborate entertainment mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
 Multiply that moment's pleasure and humanity a hundred times, reduce the venue 
capacity by a factor of 500, and you have the impact and scale of the concert 
of traditional Celtic folk music offered Friday night at Anaheim's Rose & Crown 
British Pub & Restaurant by veteran Scottish singer Andy M. Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 He was joined by Irish guitarist Gerry O'Beirne, and the first of their two 
shows was full of strong emotion and easy-flowing good humor. They played in a 
dining room that resembles a smaller, more comfortable Coach House, with a 
horseshoe of long tables surrounding a well-lit stage. The experience offered a 
direct, in-the-moment liveliness that fans all agog over stadium and arena 
attractions owe it to themselves to experience. It's something to see 
world-class musicians perform in a setting the size of a large living room. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Folk promoter Kenneth Zwick will offer two more opportunities next month at 
the Rose & Crown with shows by the amazing bluegrass guitarist Dan Crary on May 
1 and by the English folk and blues duo of Martin and Jessica Simpson on May 
22. 
</P>
<P>
 (You also might check out Incredible String Band alumnus Robin Williamson, 
another leading exponent of Celtic folk, when he plays April 30 at Shade Tree 
Stringed Instruments, an even-cozier venue in Laguna Niguel.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart and O'Beirne kept their program diverse, moving from achingly gorgeous 
ballads to romping jigs and trenchant, surging songs based on historic lore. 
The humor never stopped, whether the jokes were prepared song-intro remarks or 
off-the-cuff responses to such unpredictable developments as the sudden burst 
of Top 40 music that intruded through the restaurant's piped-in sound system 
before it quickly was shut off. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart may have overplayed a stereotype in repeated jibes about the Scots' 
reputed love of a drink (in Scottish tradition, he noted wryly, songs about 
quaffing qualify as love songs as surely as songs about courting). But he has 
the sort of amiable, unassuming delivery, expert timing and subtle 
bat-of-an-eyebrow facial expressions that easily induce laughter no matter what 
the topic. 
</P>
<P>
 He enlivened not only the between-songs chat but also the delivery of such 
comic songs as "The Errant Apprentice," a delightful romp about a luckless 
suitor that drew repeated peals of laughter with its progression of absurd 
situations and audacious rhymes. Like much of what Stewart sang, the number is 
a contemporary song, but it was written in a very old style that made it fit 
seamlessly with traditional material from the 18th and 19th centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 As a singer, Stewart was concerned more with getting the tale across than with 
dazzling displays of range and power, and that's as it should be. His lower 
range was earthy and robust, while a great tenderness and reedy ache entered in 
the higher registers that came into play on the ballads. A wonderful ballad 
singer, he displayed intensity and control in such wistful or plaintive songs 
as "The Man in the Moon" (the title song from his excellent new album), "Golden 
Golden" and "The Lakes of Pontchartrain." 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanist O'Beirne applied skillful, gossamer touches or surging momentum as 
the situation demanded. On one song, he used a humble ukulele to produce a 
spare, mysterious yet sinewy Celtic drone. O'Beirne sang two songs of his own, 
applying his slight voice to wistful material done in a style less traditional 
and more in a Simon & Garfunkel vein. 
</P>
<P>
 The closing song, a rousing Stewart original called "Ramblin' Rover," toasted 
a life lived in spontaneous, free-spirited engagement with the world and its 
ups and downs. It was a fitting conclusion to a show that embodied the 
principle.

 DOUBLE TROUBLE: If you follow the local alumni in major league baseball, it 
wasn't a bad week: Jeff Kent of the New York Mets was selected National League 
player of the week Monday and Bob Hamelin of the Kansas City Royals was picked 
as the American League's player. . . . Kent, a former Edison High standout, hit 
six homers and drove in 13 runs. Hamelin, a former Irvine High and Rancho 
Santiago College star, homered in four of five games he played last week and 
also got 13 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 HUMPTY-DUMPTY: You can say goodby soon to the abandoned terminal at John Wayne 
Airport. The county is making plans to tear it down. . . . Officials wanted to 
convert it for office use, says spokeswoman Courtney Weircioch. But they 
discovered it would be cheaper -- mainly because of serious asbestos problems 
-- just to start from scratch. The supervisors take the first steps toward 
demolition contracts at today's board meeting. The building was dedicated in 
1967, when few knew how quickly the county would outgrow it. 
</P>
<P>
 SOFTWARE CELEB: Billionaire Bill Gates, whose Microsoft Corp. is the biggest 
name in software for personal computers, makes a couple of stops in Orange 
County today. . . . He's the morning keynote speaker at the Electronics 
Messaging Assn. conference in Anaheim, where he'll announce a new line. 
Afterward, Gates will tour Ingram Micro Inc. in Santa Ana, a major distributor 
for his software. Says an Ingram spokeswoman: "We're excited about him taking a 
good look at what we're doing with his product." 
</P>
<P>
 DOCTOR'S ADVICE: When doctors need a doctor, who's first on their list? A new 
book, "The Best Doctors in America," lists 7,200 of them, based on a national 
survey of doctors asked: "If a loved one came to you with a medical problem in 
your field . . . to whom would you send them?" . . . . You'll find 37 Orange 
County doctors on the list, including 20 at the UC Irvine Medical Center. The 
book costs a bit more than an office visit -- $95.

 DITCHING CLASS: Some Thousand Oaks students skipped class Monday to avoid this 
year's California Learning Assessment System exam (B5). . . . But the ditch day 
was organized by parents opposed to the exam's effort to test how well children 
think, not just what they know. Concerned Women for America, a conservative 
Christian group, said it objects "to measures which ultimately seek to control 
the minds of our children by probing their thoughts, beliefs and feelings 
through psychotherapy disguised as public education."

 KING JUROR: The dozen Ventura County men and women scorned for their verdicts 
in the first Rodney G. King beating trial remain cautiously out of the public 
eye. . . . But juror Kathy Anderson of Atascadero, who sat in on the second 
King beating trial, will speak at a county bar association luncheon Friday. 
Anderson will tell what it's like to be sequestered for 52 days, allowed only a 
daily 10-minute phone call and a half-hour chaperoned visit on Sundays with her 
husband.

 SALES BOOST: George P. Shultz, the former secretary of state, kicked off the 
first major conference sponsored by Ronald Reagan's conservative think tank at 
his presidential library near Simi Valley (B8). . . . And the library's gift 
shop did a brisk business with Shultz's $30 book, "Turmoil and Triumph," a 
dense and serious tome of 1,184 pages about his years in Washington. Meanwhile, 
Reagan-era fans swarmed the library hoping for a chance to get Shultz's 
autograph.

 ON THE MEND: The little town of Fillmore, thrust into the spotlight because of 
its earthquake damage, gets one more shot at fame today. . . . Gov. Pete 
Wilson's wife, Gayle, and a clutch of officials will celebrate Fillmore's rapid 
recovery. Overall, the attention has been a plus, City Clerk Noreen Withers 
said. "It has perked up some people's ears that we are a viable little 
community."

6 MEMBERS OF PARAMILITARY GROUP CHARGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five men and a woman were arraigned in federal court Monday on charges 
stemming from allegations that the group ran illegal paramilitary operations in 
wilderness areas in the state, including stockpiling weapons and constructing a 
large underground bunker in Angeles National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the six, two were held without bail: Peter Thomas Clark, 34, of Culver 
City, and John Delacruz, 30, of Los Angeles. Bail ranging from $10,000 to 
$50,000 was set for the other four, identified as Jack Tsung Shieng Wu, 23, of 
Simi Valley; Rebecca Lynn Perkins, 27, of Montebello; Daniel Gomez, 21, of Los 
Angeles, and Robert Ramos, 29, of Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 A seventh person, Darren Delacruz, was being sought by authorities. A man 
identifying himself as Delacruz told The Times by telephone Monday that he was 
contemplating turning himself in. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that he, his brother, John, and Perkins had left the organization 
after only two days because of the bizarre nature of Clark, its leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy is really sick and deranged," the man said. 
</P>
<P>
 All were charged with conspiring to commit an offense against the United 
States, impersonation of a U.S. officer and malicious destruction of federal 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, lawyers for the defendants said that investigators had been 
overzealous in investigating the activities, which involved building camps in 
national forests and, officials maintained, impersonating federal agents when 
confronted by law enforcement officers in the Sequoia and Los Padres national 
forests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The case has been blown out of proportion, believe me," said Clark's lawyer, 
William O'Bryan. "Impersonating an officer -- give me a break, folks, that's 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's events were the culmination of a series of happenings stretching back 
to February, when a group of seven people was seen in the Sequoia National 
Forest. According to the Tulare County Sheriff's Department, they had built a 
trench and seemed to be running a paramilitary operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said members of the group identified themselves as part of the U.S. 
Enforcement Agency, giving the impression they were federal agents who worked 
for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Postal Service and the U.S. 
Customs Service. (The U.S. Enforcement Agency is, in fact, a private company 
that specializes in providing bouncers to nightclubs.) 
</P>
<P>
 The same thing happened in Los Padres National Forest, near Santa Barbara, 
when five of the group were again quizzed by a sheriff's deputy. Finally, some 
group members were seen building a bunker in Angeles National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The six group members arraigned Monday were arrested over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 During the course of the arraignment, it became clear that Clark was 
considered the ringleader of the operation. Assistant U.S. Atty. Mark Hardiman 
said Clark, who carries an Irish passport, claimed to have been a colonel in 
the French Foreign Legion. But Hardiman said Clark could have been no more than 
14 or 15 years old at the time, although a certificate was discovered in 
Clark's apartment attesting to his enlistment in the Foreign Legion. 
</P>
<P>
 "On its face it is of dubious authenticity," Hardiman said of the certificate. 
</P>
<P>
 It also emerged from the hearing that Clark and another of the group, 
identified as Eric Steffen, who was not charged, had gotten into a fight. 
Steffen apparently had to be rescued by another group member, Wu, who also was 
identified as a major financial backer of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The man identifying himself as Darren Delacruz said Clark's idea was for the 
group to become international bounty hunters. Members, who dressed in 
camouflage fatigues and carried weapons in their forest operations, were 
preparing for that task, he said. But Delacruz said he did not think the group 
had done anything illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one even fired a shot," he said.

NO GUN CHARGES FILED IN SUICIDE OF BOY, 10 ; TRAGEDY: PROSECUTORS SAY EVEN 
THOUGH THE FATHER'S PISTOL WAS ACCESSIBLE TO THE YOUTH, IT WAS UNLOADED. 
STATE'S CHILD PROTECTION LAW COVERS ONLY LOADED WEAPONS.

 No criminal charges will be filed against the father of a 10-year-old boy who 
sneaked the man's gun out of their house and fatally shot himself in the head 
at the entrance of the 49th Street School in South-Central Los Angeles, 
authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors declined to charge Jorge Licea Aguilar with leaving his 
.380-caliber semiautomatic pistol accessible to his son because the weapon was 
not loaded when the child took it from under a mattress, said Deputy Dist. 
Atty.David R. Traum.  
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for the Licea family applauded the decision. "That's good news. It 
shows that they took a sober look at this case," Pete Navarro said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Children's Firearm Protection Act, which holds adults responsible 
when they carelessly store guns around children, covers weapons that are 
loaded, Traum said. In this case, the bullets were stored separately on the top 
shelf of a bedroom dresser where the boy found them. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is not considered loaded because the magazine was not attached to the 
firearm," Traum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, an adult can face three years in prison and a $10,000 fine if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge shot himself Wednesday morning as other students were filing past him at 
the front door of the school, police said. He died Friday after lingering in a 
coma for two days. The death is considered a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth-grader had been disciplined the day before the shooting, reportedly 
for using profane language in class. Jorge's parents said their son recently 
brought home several notes suggesting that he was having problems in class and 
that each time, they signed them and came to school as requested. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning Jorge shot himself, police believe, he stashed the gun in his 
backpack and his father drove him to school.

NOW, WHERE'S THE LETTUCE?; PAINTER OWES $25,000 REWARD HE OFFERED FOR STOLEN 
HAMBURGER ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Downtown loft artist Robert Reynolds had a real beef with the thief who stole 
the oil painting he put on display last fall at a Los Angeles bar. 
</P>
<P>
 The artwork was a depiction of a 17th-Century Madonna figure praying over 
cheeseburgers. It was to have been the centerpiece for a series of paintings by 
the 51-year-old artist in which hamburgers represent modern-day religious 
icons. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was an angry Reynolds who offered a $25,000 reward for the return of the 
36-by-40-inch canvas titled "MacMadonna" -- and for the arrest and conviction 
of its thief. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a tipster helped police recover the painting and arrest a suspect. 
And now the fat is in the fire for the hamburger artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds suddenly has to figure out a way to pay the reward -- a whopper by 
burger-painting standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I never expected to see the painting again," Reynolds admits. 
</P>
<P>
 He borrowed money from his sister this week to pay a $750 first installment to 
the tipster. He hopes to pay off the remainder in $250 increments. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reynolds can't sell his hamburger series to raise cash because authorities 
are holding on to the MacMadonna -- with an estimated value of $4,000 -- as 
evidence in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The 31-year-old suspect, Brian Walsh Linder of West Los Angeles, is scheduled 
to appear May 5 in Los Angeles Municipal Court to answer to a grand theft 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Joked Reynolds: "I may have to go to court and testify on his behalf." 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds' troubles began Nov. 1 when the painting disappeared from the wall at 
Al's Bar, a Hewitt Street hangout popular with loft district residents. Nobody 
at the bar remembered seeing who swiped the painting, so Reynolds placed an ad 
in an art publication offering a $500 reward. 
</P>
<P>
 When that didn't work, he upped it to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was cracked by another loft artist, photographer and painter Laura 
Domela. She was visiting a Los Angeles club several months ago with friends 
when she allegedly overheard Linder, a general contractor, brag about 
possession of "a funny" Madonna-and-burgers painting. 
</P>
<P>
 When she mentioned an upcoming rooftop barbecue at her loft, Linder gave his 
name and phone number in hopes of being invited, said Domela, 26. She misplaced 
the slip of paper it was written it on until about two weeks ago, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Domela said she plans to use the reward money to pay off bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Bill Martin, a stolen-painting specialist who helped grill the 
burger-art theft suspect, said rewards are seldom a factor in solving the 150 
or so painting heists that Los Angeles police handle a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously you shouldn't put up a reward that is more than a painting is 
worth," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's good advice, said Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The $25,000 figure just popped into my head," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since then I've seen murder case rewards that are $250 or so. Next time I 
won't go crazy with the reward."

SECURITY PLAN DRAWS FIRE; SAFETY: PUBLIC HOUSING RESIDENTS PAN THE PROPOSAL FOR 
METAL DETECTORS AND GUN SEARCHES AT L.A. PROJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's call for tougher security in public housing projects, 
including metal detectors and random searches, was generally rejected Monday by 
residents at the Nickerson Gardens project in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should not have any more sets of rules than the public at large just 
because we live in public housing," said Nora King, a past president of the 
project's Residents Advisory Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton made his call Saturday in an effort to rid gang-infested housing 
projects of guns after a federal judge in Chicago blocked authorities from 
conducting sweeps for weapons. The judge ruled that the sweeps violated 
constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. 
</P>
<P>
 Public housing residents in Chicago requested the sweeps because they are 
"nearly desperate with conditions as they are," Housing and Urban Development 
Secretary Henry G. Cisneros said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles is not Chicago with its high-rise public housing, residents at 
Nickerson Gardens said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People get robbed and raped in those elevators," King said. "From what I've 
seen, Los Angeles has it far better than people in Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
 Metal detectors might make sense in Chicago, but there are no elevators and no 
common entry areas at the 1,066-unit Nickerson Gardens, the city's largest 
public housing project, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where would they put metal detectors here?" asked Larry Moore, 25, who has 
lived in the projects all his life. "At everyone's front door?" 
</P>
<P>
 Along with suggesting metal detectors, Cisneros said housing officials can 
retake their projects from gangs and drug dealers by erecting fences around the 
complexes, by conducting weapons searches in common areas such as on the 
grounds and in stairwells, and by urging tenants to sign consent forms 
permitting police searches. 
</P>
<P>
 The get-tough policies "are targeted to Chicago, but the same approach will be 
available to other communities," Cisneros said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 A Chicago police officer visiting Locke High School in Watts on Monday as part 
of an anti-gang rap music show said he is opposed to weapons sweeps at housing 
projects in his city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why sweep the buildings, when we should be sweeping the public schools, the 
entire neighborhoods," said Officer Eric Davis, 32, who is touring several 
cities with two other Chicago officers. The trio's rap group is called the 
Slick Boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can chase guns out for one week," said Davis, who patrols Chicago's 
Cabrini Green public housing project. "But what about when the searches stop? 
We want to figure out how to give people self-esteem -- give them a future." 
</P>
<P>
 Weapons searches at Nickerson Gardens are not necessary, said Delaina Carr, a 
15-year resident, "because people have a right to privacy." Security guards at 
night would be more helpful, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A RAND study released last year showed that the crime rate in Los Angeles 
public housing projects was three times as high as the citywide average from 
1986 to 1989. But by the time the study was released, a reduction in violent 
incidents had begun, housing officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gang violence, drugs and burglaries are still a concern, Carr said, but "it is 
quieter here since the gang truce a year and a half ago. You still hear 
gunshots, but you don't feel like a prisoner in your own unit." 
</P>
<P>
 Fences, as suggested by Cisneros, might help control some crimes -- especially 
those committed by people who do not live in the project, Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would improve security," she said. "People couldn't run from police, who 
could catch them easier before they could climb a fence." 
</P>
<P>
 King said a survey of residents several years ago showed that the majority 
were opposed to fencing in the project's 68.8 acres. But that attitude seemed 
to soften later, she said, and some residents now would support an 
architecturally attractive fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore gave a qualified endorsement to weapons searches, saying: "They could be 
cool. But they could lead to a lot of harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is skeptical about any proposal to search people who look 
suspicious. "I've seen criminals in three-piece suits," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For one woman standing in her doorway, allowing searches is a moot question. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do it now, anyway, don't they?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 One man who has lived at Nickerson Gardens for 31 years said he would support 
bringing in more police, but only if the new officers "know what's going on 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 "Train some of the residents to be police," said the man, who asked to remain 
anonymous. "We don't need police who've been watching too much television 
news." 
</P>
<P>
 King supports hiring people who live in the community, and she is convinced 
that such officers would respond more quickly to calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes hours for the Housing Authority police to respond -- if they come at 
all," she said. "If you're not white, you don't get that quick response."

LOW RATIO OF LATINOS IN MAGNETS CONDEMNED; EDUCATION: BOARD WILL SEEK ADVICE ON 
WHETHER IT CAN RE-EVALUATE HOW SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS ARE CHOSEN FOR PROGRAM. THE 
DISTRICT MAY ADD 21 LOCATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Board of Education members on Monday condemned the low numbers of 
Latino students selected for the district's highly prized magnet schools and 
the small number of magnets located in predominantly minority areas. 
</P>
<P>
 After a sometimes heated debate at Monday's meeting, the board agreed to seek 
legal advice to determine whether it can re-evaluate the way in which schools 
and students are chosen for the magnet program. Magnet schools were created 
after lengthy desegregation lawsuits in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Leticia Quezada said far too many magnet school seats are 
located in the San Fernando Valley and too few are available in inner-city 
areas. In addition, she said the number of Latino students and those who speak 
limited English is far too low in the magnets. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 37,000 students attending magnet schools, 10,850, or 29.2%, are Latino, 
officials said. However, Latino students constitute 66% of the district's 
640,000 students. About 3,000 magnet students, or fewer than 10%, are 
limited-English speakers. About 44% of the district's students speak limited 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members faulted the paucity of bilingual magnet programs and poor 
recruiting efforts at schools with large numbers of Latino and limited-English 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think these numbers clearly show that Latino students are being 
shortchanged in one of the best programs this district has to offer," said 
Quezada, who represents East Los Angeles. "There is no question that the magnet 
school students get a better education -- the test scores prove that. (But) 
these numbers perpetuate the disparity." 
</P>
<P>
 Board members are considering adding 21 schools to the magnet program this 
fall, including 10 in the Valley. The board is expected to vote in two weeks on 
expanding the program. The new schools would provide specialized courses in a 
variety of subjects, from Latin music to math, science and technology. 
</P>
<P>
 But board members said they are concerned that the schools would be located in 
areas that already have a high number of magnet classroom seats. They said the 
board agreed five years ago to apportion the number of seats more equally 
throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to the board, Assistant Supt. Theodore Alexander said the largest 
number of students enrolled in magnets -- 8,086 -- are in Julie Korenstein's 
San Fernando Valley district. The second-highest, with 7,209 students, is Mark 
Slavkin's district, which includes West Los Angeles and parts of the West 
Valley. The fewest magnet students -- 2,106 -- are in Victoria Castro's 
southeast district. Board member Jeff Horton's district, which includes 
Hollywood and the Mid-City area, has 2,817 enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said they know of no written policy that bars schools in 
areas with higher numbers of magnet seats from expanding or from becoming 
magnet centers. Alexander said the 21 proposed schools -- more than three times 
the number of schools that typically apply to become magnets -- are in areas 
that have space for new students. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Alexander said the district might be in violation of the court 
desegregation order by denying schools that apply for the right to become 
magnets, especially when there might not be space in other parts of the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, board members said that they want to make the magnets accessible 
to all students and that the district should be doing more to recruit Latino 
and limited-English-speaking students. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton, who represents Hollywood, said he believes there is a "gross 
inequality" in the distribution of magnet seats for minority students. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seems like such a blatant inequality . . . in a program that's 
supposed to diminish inequality," Horton said. "Irony of ironies." 
</P>
<P>
 Korenstein, an ardent magnet supporter, said Valley schools have changed 
dramatically and that the Valley is no longer "all white and affluent." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there has been a picture of what the San Fernando Valley looks like -- 
and may have looked like in the past -- that is no longer the case," Korenstein 
said, adding that she hopes many more schools will become magnets. 
</P>
<P>
 Student applications for next fall were due last Friday. If new magnets are 
approved, a supplemental application brochure will be issued. 
</P>
<P>
 Students are selected for the magnet program based on a variety of factors, 
including ethnicity. Magnet schools are considered to be integrated at 70% 
minority and 30% white. 
</P>
<P>
 But minority students are grouped together in the selection process so that 
Asian, Latino and African American students, among others, compete for space. 
White students are selected separately. 
</P>
<P>
 Created during the divisive busing battles of the late 1970s, magnets are 
intended to provide students from across the sprawling district with smaller, 
ethnically diverse student bodies and educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators and teachers from the 21 schools have said they want to become 
magnets to boost test scores and to keep high-achieving students from fleeing 
to other campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the 21 programs -- which would open up 8,000 new seats, 5,300 of 
them this fall -- the board also will consider next month expanding another 21 
magnets to create an additional 2,000 classroom seats. The board will also 
consider changing the focus of eight magnets to math, science and technology. 
Magnet Candidates Twenty-one Los Angeles Unified District schools have asked to 
join the magnet program. About 5,300 magnet seats would become available this 
fall if the new magnet centers are approved by the Board of Education. More 
than 23,000 students are on magnet waiting lists this year. These are the 
schools requesting magnet status and their specialties:

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MAN 
CONVICTED IN DENNY CASE TESTIFIES AT TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Damian Williams, serving a 10-year sentence in connection with the Reginald O. 
Denny beating, took the stand briefly Monday in the trial of the man accused of 
shooting at the trucker's big rig. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty.Kevin McCormick called Williams, 21, as a prosecution 
witness in the trial of Lance Parker. Williams supposedly implicated Parker in 
a tape-recorded confession to police. 
</P>
<P>
 But the state prison inmate, transported last week to Los Angeles from a 
prison near Sacramento, invoked his Fifth Amendment rights against 
self-incrimination.  
</P>
<P>
 Williams is appealing his convictions stemming from the Denny trial. His 
attorney, Edi M.O. Faal, said that whether his client was even at the 
intersection where the Denny beating occurred is still an issue on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was acquitted in October of the most serious charges against him 
stemming from the attack on Denny and other motorists at Florence and Normandie 
avenues on April 29, 1992. A jury found him guilty of felony mayhem and four 
counts of misdemeanor assault.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MTA BUSES 
EXAMINED IN HIT-RUN INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investigators examined more than half a dozen MTA buses Monday in an attempt 
to determine if any was involved in a fatal crash involving a bicyclist.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hit-and-run investigation.The driver and the bus have not been 
identified," said Detective Mike Fischer of the Los Angeles Police Department's 
West Traffic Division.  
</P>
<P>
 Bicyclist Otto Poggio, 31, died at the scene of the 6:53 a.m. accident at 
Santa Monica Boulevard and Gower Street, Fischer said.  
</P>
<P>
 Poggio and the bus were both eastbound, Fischer said, and as the bus passed it 
collided with the bike. 
</P>
<P>
 Poggio "lost control and went down in the roadway, at which time there was a 
second contact," Fischer said. "The bus continued eastbound. It didn't stop." 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear if the bus actually rolled over the man, Fischer said.  
</P>
<P>
 None of the drivers admitted knowing about the accident, Fischer said, and 
"there's no indication of which bus it is."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WILSHIRE DISTRICT; 
COUNTRY CLUB SETTLES DISCRIMINATION SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Wilshire Country Club reached a confidential settlement in a lawsuit 
brought by a former employee who claimed that the club discriminated against 
black workers, the woman's attorney said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 As a condition of the settlement, the amount was kept confidential, said 
attorney Dan Stormer, who represents Margaret Inyama. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiff, who was a cook at the club, claimed that the discrimination 
included forcing black employees to park in separate parking lots from whites.  
</P>
<P>
 The 52-year-old Baldwin Hills resident also claimed that she was physically 
abused by her boss, who allegedly pushed her against the side door of a walk-in 
freezer so hard that she had to get medical treatment.  
</P>
<P>
 Inyama, who was on a disability leave when the suit was filed, has been unable 
to return to work because of complications unrelated to the lawsuit, Stormer 
said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; PROPOSAL 
WOULD PUT FULL COUNCIL IN CHARGE OF CRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A panel of City Council members recommended Monday that the full City Council, 
instead of a commission appointed by Mayor Richard Riordan, be placed in 
control of the city's economic development efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 If the recommendation is approved, the city's lawmakers would be placed in 
charge of the Community Redevelopment Agency or a larger Economic Development 
Commission that may replace it.The redevelopment agency is currently run by a 
Riordan-appointed commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over who should control the city's economic development policy has 
been raised as the City Council and Riordan have presented competing plans for 
consolidating city departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said the City Council should direct economic 
development efforts because its members represent all the city's communities 
and many ethnic groups. Riordan has sought to maintain control of the Community 
Redevelopment Agency as part of a new Economic Development Department that he 
will propose when he announces his budget Wednesday.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; JUSTICES 
UPHOLD CHALLENGE TO CURBS ON ADULT BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to squelch a challenge to a Los 
Angeles zoning ordinance aimed at strictly limiting where X-rated movie houses 
and adult bookstores are located. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that stopped city officials 
from enforcing the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of adult businesses sued the city in 1991, contending that the 
ordinance violates free-speech rights because it is too restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, originally enacted in 1978 and strengthened in subsequent 
years, eventually was made to apply retroactively, requiring many existing 
adult businesses to relocate. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Richard Gadbois Jr. issued a preliminary injunction 
barring enforcement of the ordinance until its constitutionality could be 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that preliminary injunction last 
year, saying, "A real question exists about whether the ordinance provides the 
adult businesses with constitutionally sufficient alternative relocation 
sites." 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance bars such businesses within 500 feet of any residence, church, 
school or park, and within 1,000 feet of any other adult business.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CLAREMONT; SERIAL 
RAPIST'S PAROLE REVOKED AS EXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Convicted serial rapist Christopher Hubbart's parole was revoked as expected 
Monday after a Department of Corrections hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbart, who has been in and out of prison since 1973, recently caused a furor 
in Claremont, where he was scheduled to be paroled in March.Residents protested 
when it was learned that he planned to return to his parents' home there. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbart failed a psychiatric examination on the day he was to be paroled, 
however, and was returned to prison in Chino pending Monday's revocation 
hearing. The decision Monday was based on reports and testimony by Parole 
Hearings Division staff and an evaluating psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbart's parole was revoked for a year, and he will be returned to prison to 
receive psychiatric treatment that cannot be provided within the community, 
said Bill Gengler, a corrections spokesman.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SHOPPERS' TENT CITY; 
NORTHRIDGE BROADWAY REOPENS UNDER A BIG TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ladies and gentlemen, step right up! The big top has arrived in the San 
Fernando Valley and is open to all. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the main tent is china, furniture, cordless phones and quilts from 
parts near and far. There's even gadgets for the little ones -- all for a 
special price. And they take American Express. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge Fashion Center's Broadway department store, shuttered since the 
Jan. 17 temblor, has found a new venue -- the "Home Dome," two air-conditioned 
tents pitched in the devastated mall's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 From the outside, the two interconnected tents look more likely to contain a 
trapeze act than a set of kitchen knives. Inside the dome, it looks just like 
any other Broadway. Colorful displays and sale signs adorn the interior, and 
everything is departmentalized. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've done a wonderful job of making it attractive," said Lucille Malvani, 
68, of Granada Hills, who was shopping for glasses to replace a set that 
shattered in the quake. "And I feel much safer beneath this ceiling than I do 
in a regular store right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The carpeted tents -- 300 feet long and 60 feet wide -- have been open since 
Friday and will remain open until the main mall store reopens in late fall, 
according to Steve Holden, operations manager for the Home Dome, which employs 
about 75 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The domes were erected, decorated and stocked with items by Broadway personnel 
in five weeks, he said. "Most (customers) are amazed that you can put something 
together that looks this good this quick in a parking lot," Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-tech tents are made by the Clamshell Co., a Ventura firm that 
specializes in temporary structures. About 140 of the tents -- which can 
sustain winds of up to 120 m.p.h. and are built to seismic standards -- housed 
airplanes during the Persian Gulf War. They were also used as relief centers 
during Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki, according to Mark Alexander, marketing 
manager for Clamshell. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

CHEERS FOR CHAMPIONS; BANNERS, FLAGS AND REPEATED SHOUTS OF 'NO. 1!' WELCOME 
HOME TAFT'S TRIUMPHANT ACADEMIC DECATHLON WINNERS 
</P>

 The waiting area at Los Angeles International Airport was transformed into a 
sea of red and yellow Monday. There were balloons, carnations, banners and 
school shirts -- all heralding Taft High School in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The assembled student government leaders waited excitedly for the flight from 
Newark, N.J., that carried their schoolmates, winners of the 13th annual U.S. 
Academic Decathlon. The students in the waiting area made as much noise as the 
planes overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say 'number,' you say 'one!' " someone shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Number . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "One!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Number . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "One!"  
</P>
<P>
 As the cheering continued, another group of supporters showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ditched school to come see our friends," said 18-year-old senior Hilla 
Shprung. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilla and about five others said they had to take an English test early so 
they could come to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a good year for us," said Jennifer Zankan, the student body 
historian. "My scrapbook's full."  
</P>
<P>
 About 15 minutes later, the students crowded around one of the gates as the 
jet pulled up to the terminal. The victors were among the last to get off the 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberly Shapiro was welcomed by two of her best friends, Jennifer Fields, 17, 
and Shauna Howard, 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks earlier, the three of them had spent part of their spring break in 
Palm Springs. For Kimberly, it had been a needed respite from long hours of 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if you relax part of the time and you're not stressing out 
completely, you perform better," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberly's philosophy proved successful as she captured a gold medal in the 
speech category and finished third among 175 students in the B 
grade-point-average group. She also netted a $2,000 scholarship, one of many 
for the Taft students. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Salter, who finished as the second-best student overall, behind 
teammate Daniel Berdichevsky, held up the winning trophy as others waved 
California state flags. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel said that being crowned the best high school academic in the nation 
among students with A averages has left him in a good mood. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the next few weeks and probably for a long time, I'm going to be the 
happiest person in the city," Daniel said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has fulfilled his ultimate goal -- "to be a member of the No. 1 
team in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Shaw, 16, and the team's only junior, did not know if he would compete 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't really thought about it," Stephen said. "Right now, I'm feeling an 
extreme high." 
</P>
<P>
 Sage Vaughn, a senior, received hugs and kisses from his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Sage, a self-described underachiever and one of the team's three C students, 
said he was coerced into joining the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The college counselor and my history teacher saw my potential and talked me 
into trying out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After completing a journey that began nine months ago, the champions left the 
national competition having recorded the highest score in the history of the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this kind of challenge can bring out the best in everyone," Andrew 
said.

DISTRICT TRIES TO SORT OUT THE JARGON OF REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First there were stake-holders who decided on cluster configurations. Then 
came cluster leaders. And on Monday, "complex cabinets" joined the oftentimes 
bewildering vocabulary of school reform in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, the cabinets will be councils of parents, teachers and principals 
who will not have to take orders from Downtown bureaucrats and who will be able 
to decide on their own how to educate children in their schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone will be the six Los Angeles Unified School District regional offices that 
have served as liaisons between the 645 schools and officials Downtown. In 
their place will be the cabinets at 27 new self-governing entities to be called 
community clusters. 
</P>
<P>
 "In short, folks, we are talking about local control and local involvement," 
Supt. Sid Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an 11-page report to the Board of Education, Thompson said the cabinets are 
essential to a major reorganization of the giant district. Under the 
restructuring, cabinets will help guide instruction at the new clusters, which 
will be created by linking elementary and middle schools with the high schools 
they feed. 
</P>
<P>
 Each cluster of schools will have the power to make educational decisions 
jointly for its campuses and will share resources. A cluster leader to be 
appointed by Thompson will act as the key manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "One criticism that has been heard regarding our planning process is that it 
lacks specifics," Thompson said. "Our response is that we must have the courage 
and determination to let the schools be free." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He also said the restructuring plan will not cost any more money but will 
consume about $7.9 million now being spent on the regional offices. 
</P>
<P>
 For those in need of an interpreter to understand the new terms being thrown 
about by school reformers, Thompson's report defined some elements of the most 
commonly used jargon. 
</P>
<P>
 A cluster comprises one or more high schools and all of their neighborhood 
feeder schools. Each high school is at the top of a complex of schools. Each 
cluster will have a cluster leader, a sort of ombudsman for the schools. The 
leader will interact with the stake-holders -- essentially, anyone who cares 
about what is going on at a school. 
</P>
<P>
 Even for insiders who have put in time on school reform issues and try to talk 
the talk, this new vernacular is difficult to use. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is hard to understand what is going on when you first get involved 
because of all the new words and acronyms," said Kathleen Dixon, a parent 
leader. "We stutter before we say complex or cluster to make sure we are using 
the right term." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson's plan also calls for creation of a Parents/Community Services Unit, 
or PCSU. The person to be hired for this office will be assigned the task of 
drafting a glossary of terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson wants to set up another unit called "Support Services." This unit 
will be charged with finding ways to link schools with health and social 
services. This districtwide unit would ensure that school nurses and 
psychologists are meeting the needs of individual schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The district restructuring plan is purposely high on goals and low on 
specifics. Although Thompson is calling for the creation of complex cabinets, 
he is leaving it up to schools to decide who and how many people should serve 
on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the district to be specific and directive in the development of any 
aspect of this restructuring process will defeat the purpose and will be 
contradictory to the principles of the process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although school board members said nothing to indicate that they will not 
approve the plan May 2, several want Thompson to come back with more details 
and are concerned that the new jargon is confusing the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Barbara Boudreaux wants to see a timeline for implementing the 
entire plan. School board President Leticia Quezada said the job of a cluster 
leader needs to be more clearly defined. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ought to say it all in plain English, so everyone can understand it," 
Quezada said. "Then we can translate it to plain Spanish, Armenian and everyone 
else on the street." A Cluster of Terms Under a new restructuring plan, the Los 
Angeles Unified School District will assign most campuses to "clusters" on July 
1. One result is a bewildering new vernacular. Here are some examples: 
</P>
<P>
 * High school complex -- One or more high schools, and all the lower-grade 
campuses in their area. 
</P>
<P>
 * Community cluster -- A group of one or more high school complexes, which 
will make many instructional decisions jointly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stake-holders -- The parents, teachers, students and others who have a stake 
in a school's well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 * Complex cabinet -- A committee of stake-holders that will decide educational 
policy in each high school complex.

TEACHER FACES MULTIPLE SEXUAL OFFENSE CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An elementary schoolteacher, who is already facing charges of sexually 
assaulting a colleague, has been charged with attacking two other women, 
including a 17-year-old he met while on duty as a Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputy, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors filed four additional felony charges Friday against Edward Keith 
Culhane, 35, who worked as a sheriff's deputy from January, 1982, to August, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Culhane is charged with raping the teen-ager in June, 1990, after luring her 
to a Comfort Inn in Lakewood on the pretense of helping her with a college 
English paper, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert B. Foltz Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Culhane left the Sheriff's Department 14 months after this alleged assault. 
</P>
<P>
 A single count of sexual battery, also filed last week, alleges that Culhane 
improperly touched a 22-year-old baby-sitter in a lewd manner. "He got sexually 
out of line with her," Foltz said. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Culhane now faces seven felony counts, including three charges related 
to an alleged assault on a teacher with whom he worked at Santa Clarita 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary hearing on the three charges is scheduled for Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 Charges against Culhane were first filed two months ago after a teacher 
alleged that he attacked her Nov. 5 in a classroom after children had been 
dismissed for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The 44-year-old teacher has since filed a $1-million claim against the Saugus 
Union School District, alleging that she was sexually assaulted and then 
district officials directed the woman not to report the alleged assault to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials have said that Culhane was put on paid leave Jan. 14, 
pending the results of the criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Culhane is free after previously posting $50,000 bail.

FED BOOSTS RATES FOR A THIRD TIME; ECONOMY: NEWEST QUARTER-POINT INCREASE IN 
INTEREST IN THE LAST 90 DAYS SHAKES FINANCIAL MARKETS. CONCERNS ARE RAISED 
ABOUT WHETHER ACTION MAY CURB THE RECOVERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates Monday for the third time 
in less than three months, sending another shiver through financial markets 
already bloodied by mounting fears of inflation and rising borrowing costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's move to raise to 3.75% the benchmark federal funds rate, which banks 
charge each other for overnight loans, came far more quickly than most analysts 
had expected. The quarter-point increase raised new concerns about whether the 
Fed is being so aggressive in its efforts to choke off inflation that it may 
actually curb the fledgling economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's major banks responded by raising the prime lending rate by a half 
percentage point to 6.75%. That marked the second increase in less than a 
month, and it placed the prime rate at its highest level since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's action is also certain to drive up interest rates on a wide variety 
of other business and consumer loans -- although banks have so far been 
reluctant to increase the rates they pay out to depositors on certificates of 
deposit and savings accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Now most Wall Street analysts and economic policy-makers within the Clinton 
Administration believe the Fed will continue to raise rates until it is 
convinced the economy can continue to grow without bringing on a surge in 
prices. Most analysts believe that the Fed will gradually increase the federal 
funds rate until it plateaus around 4.25% by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the economic indicators are still quite strong, and so I think the Fed 
will continue to move," observed David Hale, chief economist at Kemper 
Financial Services in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, stock and bond prices tumbled again after Fed Chairman Alan 
Greenspan announced the rate hike following a morning conference call with 
other Fed members. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 41.05 points to close 
at 3,620.42. The 30-year Treasury bond fell $14.38 per $1,000 in face value as 
its yield rose to 7.42% from 7.28% on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's last two rate increases, on Feb. 4 and March 22, also sent stock and 
bond prices down as traders feared higher rates would harm the value of their 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan, who took the action without asking for a vote of the Fed's key 
policy-making committee, was clearly responding to mounting evidence the 
economy is growing at a more rapid pace than economists predicted at the 
beginning of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the action also came just days after the government issued reports 
suggesting inflation is still in check; Clinton Administration officials 
privately argue that there is no evidence to support the Fed's growing concerns 
about rising prices. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton and his advisers on Monday continued their policy of 
refraining from criticizing the Fed's actions. Robert E. Rubin, chairman of the 
National Economic Council at the White House, believes strongly that criticism 
from the Administration will only roil the financial markets and undermine the 
Fed's credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope that we continue not to comment, because the long-term health of 
the economy requires an independent Fed," noted one senior Administration 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Fed's rate hikes have created an awkward situation for the 
Administration, which has consistently argued that a chief benefit of its 1993 
economic plan would be lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 So while they refuse to challenge the Fed's decision to raise rates, Clinton 
and his aides make no secret that they believe the central bank is exaggerating 
the threat of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still no evidence of troubling inflation in this economy, but there 
is a lot of evidence of growth," Clinton said Monday in Milwaukee. But to make 
it clear he was not trying to pick a fight with Greenspan, Clinton added that 
the latest increase still leaves interest rates "within the range that should 
not do harm to the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton should soon have his own appointees on the Fed's board of governors to 
give voice to his concerns on monetary policy. Administration officials said 
Monday that they hope to announce later this week the appointment of White 
House economist Alan Blinder to become Fed vice chairman, succeeding David 
Mullins, who resigned earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, White House sources say they now have a leading candidate to fill 
a second vacancy on the seven-member board and hope to make a final decision 
this week. Administration officials refused to reveal the name of the likely 
nominee, except to say the person is a woman economist who is not now working 
in the Clinton Administration. If named, she will succeed Wayne Angell, a 
Republican whose term expired in February and who was known as one of the chief 
anti-inflation hawks inside the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Monday, Blinder refused to comment directly on the rate 
increase but made it clear that he does not believe the Fed's actions have 
begun to drag economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've seen is that rates are going up while private economic forecasters 
are still raising their estimates of economic growth, not lowering them," 
Blinder said. "So it looks like interest rate (increases) are being driven by 
economic growth, not the reverse. The economy is growing, and that is pushing 
rates up." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Fed move clearly caught Wall Street off guard. Last week's modest 
inflation figures had convinced many analysts that the Fed would not raise 
rates again for another month or so, especially considering how badly each 
earlier increase had shaken the financial markets. They were expecting that the 
next rate increase would not come until the May 17 meeting of the Federal Open 
Market Committee, which sets monetary policy for the central bank. 
</P>
<P>
 One Fed official who asked not to be identified said the Fed has been deeply 
concerned about the response on Wall Street to its rate hikes since February. 
The official noted that the Fed's leadership has been especially surprised by 
the extent to which long-term interest rates have risen in response to the 
Fed's increases in short-term rates. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that the Fed moved Monday in spite of such worries but added that 
some senior Fed officials are increasingly concerned about whether they 
themselves are exaggerating the threat from inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Greenspan's decision to announce the rate increase publicly again 
may have fueled the swift response in the markets. Many analysts believe that 
Greenspan has decided to change longstanding Fed policy and publicly announce 
its actions immediately as a way to respond to congressional pressure for 
greater disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fed spokesman Joseph Coyne said Monday that the central bank has not 
decided on a permanent change in policy and is still studying whether to 
continue to announce each rate increase immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Many consumer and business loans are tied directly to the prime rate. It is, 
for example, the benchmark used to calculate rates charged on such things as 
credit cards.

ROSEANNE ARNOLD FILES FOR DIVORCE, JOLTS TV INDUSTRY; ENTERTAINMENT: STAR OF 
TOP-RATED SHOW CLAIMS ABUSE BY HUSBAND, TOM. EFFECT ON THEIR PRODUCTIONS IS 
UNCERTAIN. 
</P>

<P>
 Roseanne Arnold filed for divorce Monday from her husband, Tom, apparently 
ending a professional partnership known for its intimidating show business 
clout and a personal union that she says was secretly plagued by alleged 
physical and psychological abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold, star of ABC's top-rated "Roseanne" series, filed divorce papers in Los 
Angeles Superior Court three days after bitter arguments by the couple outside 
the Studio City set of "Roseanne" and at their Brentwood home. 
</P>
<P>
 In court papers, she wrote: "Throughout our marriage, (Tom Arnold) has been 
physically and emotionally abusive toward me. I now realize that I am a classic 
battered and abused wife who has tolerated the conduct . . . only because 
(Arnold) has successfully lowered my self-esteem and reduced me into the realm 
of battered wife syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
 The split instantly became a hot topic on radio and television shows 
nationwide Monday. It also fueled speculation in many entertainment industry 
circles about whether the "Roseanne" series and the couple's several other 
television and motion picture projects, under their Wapello County production 
company arm, would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arnolds, who have been married four years, were executive producers of 
"Roseanne," "Tom," and last season's "The Jackie Thomas Show," canceled by ABC. 
They signed a long-term development deal last year with Warner Bros. to produce 
several comedy series. 
</P>
<P>
 If Roseanne Arnold presses ahead with the divorce, it would mark another twist 
in a tempestuous relationship that made network executives jump through hoops 
to please television's top female star. Roseanne Arnold recently had expressed 
unhappiness with ABC, and executives at other networks, including CBS, have 
been trying to woo her away. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Arnold could be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 During the marriage, Roseanne Arnold's popularity gave her enough power to 
influence executives at ABC and CBS to pluck her husband out of relative 
obscurity and make him the star of two network series. One was "The Jackie 
Thomas Show" and the other is "Tom" on CBS, which is struggling and not 
expected to be renewed for next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that she was the bigger star, Roseanne Arnold had maintained 
that he was the key creative force that kept "Roseanne" on top of the ratings. 
She also credited him with rescuing her from her first, unhappy marriage and a 
tormented past. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the one person who has ever kept up with me," she was quoted as saying 
in a Vanity Fair magazine profile this year. "We've had bad stuff, too, but he 
tried very hard to take care of me. I do with him too. That's real nice." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple seemed to be together constantly, and their antics were continual 
fodder for tabloids and entertainment news outlets. They once mooned a camera 
with their respective rear-end tattoos at a sports event. They were 
photographed mud-wrestling for Vanity Fair. They both disclosed that they were 
victims of child abuse. They gave freely to charity and would appear on each 
other's shows. 
</P>
<P>
 David Colden, an entertainment attorney compared the split of the Arnolds to 
that of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, who owned the Desilu production company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Desi, in terms of the business was far more important. But Roseanne is the 
heir-apparent to the comedy crown that Lucy had in the 1950s. Creatively, where 
the company will go will be guided by her. How the loss of her life partner 
will affect her mentally will have a business impact. But that's true of any 
divorce. Lucy went on to a number of other successful series." 
</P>
<P>
 In an affidavit filed in support of a temporary restraining order, Roseanne 
Arnold described several violent incidents in which she said her husband 
attacked her. She maintained that her husband, throughout their marriage, "hit 
me, struck me, has thrown objects at me, pinched me and verbally abused me. He 
has also pushed me against walls, while he screams and shouts at me, drowning 
out any possible pleas that I might make for him to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, Roseanne Arnold wrote that she attempted to bar Tom from the 
"Roseanne" studio, but that he gained entry anyway "and assaulted four people 
in a violent episode. He scratched and hit these individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 Later that night, she said Tom Arnold threatened her three children at the 
couple's Brentwood home. She said he had moved out of the house six months 
earlier into a Westside condo under mutual agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 She accused him of becoming more violent in recent months: "I have finally 
come to the realization that I must not subject myself to his conduct. My life 
would be ruined if I continue in this abusive relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Roseanne Arnold has alleged for several years that she was sexually, 
physically and emotionally abused by her parents. Those accusations were 
disputed by her family Sunday in a segment on CBS' "60 Minutes," in which her 
family said Roseanne Arnold had fabricated the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 How the split between Roseanne and Tom Arnold will affect both careers will be 
watched closely by the industry. It was rare that the couple was separated. She 
had dedicated her recent autobiography, "My Lives," to her spouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "To Tom," she wrote. "You and I are our own garden. Unpruned, unmarked, we 
drink and grow, gnarled in elemental magic. . . . I float through you, My 
love." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their professed love for one another, rumors have circulated for 
months that he had been having an affair with Kim Silva, his assistant. The 
Arnolds, in fact, openly joked about the rumors and -- in a publicity stunt -- 
announced a three-way "marriage." They even presented Silva with an 
eight-carat-diamond engagement ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics predicted Monday that the rift might be another one of the Arnolds' 
headline-grabbing stunts. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all, the argument did come on the last day of this season's filming for 
'Roseanne,' " said one source close to the show who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Another source close to the couple said: "It seems oddly calculated, the 
timing of it coming at the end of filming. They strike me as a couple who 
doesn't break up until one of them gets a bullet in the head."

COLUMN ONE; TIME TO SET THE HUMAN CLOCK BACK; LASERS AND VOLCANIC ASH ARE 
HELPING SCIENTISTS DATE FOSSILS MORE PRECISELY. PINPOINTING LUCY'S AGE IS ONLY 
THE BEGINNING OF THE EVOLUTION REVOLUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The path to humanity's origins leads through a side door in a divinity school, 
down a basement staircase and into the laboratory where, by a laser's fierce 
light, Robert C. Walter is prospecting for time. 
</P>
<P>
 From his swivel chair, Walter is combing samples of a prehistoric lake shore 
that vanished before our primitive ancestors learned to make tools or 
discovered fire. He hopes to pinpoint the moment that that coastline -- and the 
scampering apelike pre-humans that inhabited it -- flourished millennia ago. 
</P>
<P>
 When he is done, Walter will have helped to transform an arid hellhole of 
bedded silt, sand and volcanic ash in a desolate corner of Ethiopia into a 
calibrated yardstick of human evolution, marking off 400,000 years of early 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 At the private Institute of Human Origins in Berkeley, Walter and his 
colleagues are using their ability to read the hidden time in the layers of 
lava deposits around the world to re-date -- and rewrite -- the history of 
human evolution over the past 4 million years. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists who can read the hands on the natural clock of Earth have become 
arbiters of the acrimonious wars that often rage over scientific theories of 
human development. In the process they have settled some heated academic 
disputes, while triggering new, even fiercer debates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are truth-sayers," said Paul R. Renne, director of the institute's 
geochronology laboratory, which has become a leading center for fossil dating. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, the scientists' ability to date human fossils more precisely 
has spurred new questions about how quickly primitive hominids evolved into 
modern humans, when they began making tools, and when they first left their 
African homeland. They also ended a decades-long mystery by pinpointing the age 
of Lucy -- the 3.18-million-year-old skeleton that may be our most famous early 
ancestor. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute's work this year also has triggered debate over whether Africa 
was the cradle of humanity, as many scientists believe, or whether our 
ancestors evolved in many places around the world at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 All that these dating experts have to work with is the volcanic rock and ash 
that anthropologists might otherwise discard in their search for scraps of 
bones preserved in stone. By analyzing the chemical contents of rock crystals 
from fossil-bearing deposits, researchers can calculate their age. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the paucity of data on the ancient human record, the ability to date the 
rocks that yield fossils is especially crucial, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, researchers could best gauge the age of a hominid fossil by 
comparing its anatomy to bones found at other sites or by evaluating more 
numerous animal fossils found in nearby sediments. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were often open to question. The hominid fossils were too old for 
some laboratory dating techniques, too young for others, and too precious to 
grind up as samples for any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, scientists can calibrate time using the periodic swings of Earth's 
magnetic poles through the ages, or by the rate at which radioactive uranium 
naturally turns to lead. Sometimes they can calculate the passage of time by 
counting the minute tracks on a rock left by spontaneous fission. 
</P>
<P>
 Some researchers can measure time by recording the light emitted by residual 
electrons from sunlight trapped in buried sediments, or by assessing chemical 
changes in the composition of the fossil. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a boon to anthropologists because a hominid fossil without a reliable 
date is a foundling on the doorstep of time, with no sure place in the human 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 At best, it is a museum curiosity that conceals just how it fits precisely 
into the puzzle of evolution, scientists said. At worst, with a misleading 
date, it is a false clue. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite decades of dedicated searching, paleoanthropologists have discovered 
only a few thousand fragments of bone to cover the millions of years it took 
humanity to acquire upright posture, a large brain, language and tool-making 
ability. For some of the most crucial periods, there are no known human 
fossils. 
</P>
<P>
 An ancient blackened molar can be enough for ambitious theorists to conceive a 
new hominid species. Reputations can be built around a single skeleton or a 
fossilized footprint. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anthropologists love to develop theories and then treat the theories as 
fact," said dating expert Garniss Curtis, who founded the institute laboratory 
and developed much of the technology in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the human evolutionary story, it is very difficult to test these opposing 
models and hypotheses because the evidence is so fragmentary and the dating of 
it has been so poor," said Tim D. White of UC Berkeley's Laboratory for Human 
Evolutionary Studies. "You could accommodate the fossil record to whatever 
point of view you had." 
</P>
<P>
 New, more sensitive dating techniques allow researchers to reconcile the 
evidence of fossil hominids found around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The new technology of dating also is giving scientists their first real 
glimpse into the speed and pace of human evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mode of evolutionary change is often very obvious," said institute 
President Donald C. Johanson. "The teeth get bigger. The skull gets larger. The 
brain case increases. What people would like to know is the tempo of 
evolutionary change." 
</P>
<P>
 "The techniques of dating are increasing in accuracy in leaps and bounds," 
said Elisabeth Vrba, an expert on paleobiology and geology at Yale University. 
"All kinds of new techniques are coming to bear." 
</P>
<P>
 All the dating methods have drawbacks. Some work only if the sample is 
relatively new; others are effective only with the most ancient samples. 
Uranium-lead dating is only useful for rocks that are more than 25 million 
years old. Others have margins of error so broad that they are useless in 
calibrating the precise increments of human evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when scientists can date layers of sediments and ash, they still must 
prove whether the fossil belongs in the layer where it was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 If a fossil is young enough -- usually less than 50,000 years old -- 
researchers can determine its age precisely by measuring the amount of 
carbon-14 it may have absorbed from the atmosphere while it was alive. The 
technique has been a mainstay for decades, but if the fossil is too much older 
-- as most early hominid fossils are -- radio-carbon dating is not reliable. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists owe their confidence in the newest dating results to refinements in 
potassium-argon dating, which derives information from analysis of volcanic 
deposits. It picks up where carbon-dating leaves off -- 50,000 years ago and 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Computerized argon laser fusion, a variant of potassium-dating developed by 
University of Toronto researchers and the Berkeley group, is so sensitive that 
a scientist can use one crystal of volcanic ash to determine the geologic 
instant when our ancestors walked the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 It has become the tool of choice for those attempting to date early human 
evolution, Renne said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dating has gotten a lot better in the last few years, much more reliable, 
with much fewer errors," said Andrew Hill, curator for anthropology at Yale's 
Peabody Museum of Natural History. "And in connection with human evolution, it 
is largely because of that institute lab." 
</P>
<P>
 In his basement laboratory, Walter methodically steers the laser beam over an 
irradiated grain of volcanic ash mined from an ancient lakeside in Ethiopia 
where the remains of some of mankind's earliest known ancestors have been 
found. The laboratory's computerized laser fusion setup can handle 221 samples 
at a time on a platform the size of an Oreo. 
</P>
<P>
 The grain is no larger than a crystal from a saltshaker. 
</P>
<P>
 He blasts it into oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the instant the grain glows white hot, it gives up a gas like a last breath 
that is exhaled into a maze of heated steel tubes and wheezing vacuum pumps, 
purified, and charged by an electron beam. 
</P>
<P>
 A powerful magnet accelerates the charged gas and hurls it against a device 
that counts its constituent argon atoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Each speeding argon atom is a measure of time on a clock set when the universe 
was made. 
</P>
<P>
 By measuring the relative amounts of two isotopes of the element, researchers 
can tell how much time has elapsed since the lava cooled and crystals formed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Argon accumulates over time. The older the sample, the more argon there is in 
it and the easier it is to measure," Walter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Walter came up with the first reliable date for the fossil 
skeleton known as Lucy. Last month, he put a date on the first nearly complete 
skull from her species, making it the youngest known example of the earliest 
recognized human ancestor. 
</P>
<P>
 He was able to establish the date by bracketing the bones in time. He dated 
crystals of volcanic feldspar taken from layers of ash around where the fossils 
were found, establishing a narrow range when the diminutive hominids were 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lucy was discovered about 20 years ago and we have been trying to figure out 
how old this fossil was ever since," Walter said. "Lucy has become an icon for 
her species, a fashion model. Everybody knows who she is, but we never 
understood how old she was." 
</P>
<P>
 Her remains are now believed to be more than 3.18 million years old, making 
her one of the youngest known members of her species. 
</P>
<P>
 Johanson, who discovered the Lucy skeleton in 1974 and later established the 
nonprofit institute in the building that houses UC Berkeley's divinity school, 
was relieved to see the age question finally settled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that, at long last, we have nailed down what was a slippery date for 
Lucy, it adds integrity to the whole notion of the family trees we put 
together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined with other new fossil evidence discovered in different parts of 
Africa by White and Johanson, scientists are convinced that her fragmented 
remains represent a single species -- Australopithecus afarensis -- that 
thrived for more than 900,000 years without significant physical changes, until 
something jolted them out of their evolutionary rut and onto the path to modern 
humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 The laboratory's dating work also is eliminating the uncertainty clouding all 
the fossils discovered in the Hadar, the area of Ethiopia where Lucy was found. 
It is one of the world's richest sources of hominid fossils. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hadar, which was a remarkably rich source of fossils, was handicapped by 
the inability to date anything reliably," said William H. Kimbel, institute 
director of paleontology. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem was technical. When the first hominid fossils were 
discovered there in the mid-1970s, potassium dating was so crude that 500 
pounds of samples might yield a few ounces of material pure enough for testing. 
The results often raised as many questions as they tried to answer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problems were also political. For a decade, civil unrest in Ethiopia 
and changes in government policies effectively barred foreign researchers from 
the Hadar. So even when the technology improved, Johanson, Walter and their 
colleagues could not collect new samples to date the fossils. They finally were 
allowed to return in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Now experts must consider the idea that bands of these prehistoric pre-humans 
may have begun their journey from their evolutionary homeland more than half a 
million years earlier than believed. Curtis speculates that the primitive 
ancestors may have left Africa even earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Curtis and Swisher rearranged the history of this prolific species, most 
anthropologists believed that its success was based on mastery of prehistoric 
high-technology. Armed with sharper stone axes, Homo erectus carved out a place 
for itself wherever it went, spreading to the Middle East, Europe and across 
Asia to the Pacific, experts thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they are not so sure. The new date means that the hominids may have been 
well-established around the world long before the development of the more 
sophisticated stone tools. 
</P>
<P>
 It complicates an entire pattern of human evolution, experts said. No one now 
can be certain whether Homo erectus developed in Asia rather than in Africa, as 
most evidence indicates, or whether the development of tools had anything to do 
with the species' success, or even if the two are members of the same species. 
</P>
<P>
 Now no one can be sure which group gave rise to modern humanity. So far, most 
experts are treating the new date very cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows that people got out of Africa earlier than we thought," Hill said. 
"I don't think it shows that people evolved in Asia. . . . It doesn't shake the 
whole family tree," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In all likelihood, the learned arguments over the Java fossils will last out 
the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 But scientists on both sides acknowledge that the revolution in dating 
technology puts the debate over human origins in proper focus, with the 
emphasis on the meaning hidden in the rock-encrusted fragments of human 
ancestors, not the hunt for their proper place in time. 
</P>
<P>
 When scientists can find a fossil's niche in time, they also discover its 
rightful place in the story of human evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 And when scientists refine the age of museum specimens, it can force other 
researchers to reconsider the meaning of even the well-studied human fossils, 
calling into question some of the most cherished conceptions of evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Curtis and institute researcher Charles Swisher III revealed that 
another well-known fossil of a more recent human ancestor -- a prehistoric 
child whose skull was discovered in Java in 1936 -- was a million years older 
than believed. This upset what had been thought to be one of the few 
straightforward stories of human origins. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, the tortoise-shell-shaped fossil -- an example of a species 
called Homo erectus that followed Lucy and her kind -- was thought to be 1 
million years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Using state-of-the-art argon-dating, Curtis and Swisher calculated the skull's 
age at 1.8 million years. That makes it the oldest hominid fossil found outside 
Africa, and as old as the earliest examples of Homo erectus found in East 
Africa. The Evoluntionary Yardstick 
</P>
<P>
 Sophisticated dating techniques are turning simple sediments into 
high-technology timelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists recently unearthed the first almost complete skull of humanity's 
earliest recognized ancestor, Australopithecus afarensis . 
</P>
<P>
 The sparse fossil record suggests that there were several species of primitive 
hominids, sometimes co-existing, before modern humans emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 Many experts think that Neandarthals and modern humans are so different 
anatomically that they could not belong to the same species. 
</P>
<P>
 Homo neanderthalensis (Neanderthal) 
</P>
<P>
 Homo sapiens (Modern man) 
</P>
<P>
 120,000 years ago: Dating helps overturn a theory that Neanderthals evolved 
into early modern humans about 50,000 years ago, by identifying primitive 
Neandarthal and human remains between 100,000 years and 120,000 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 3.18 million years ago: More precise argon dating for humanity's earliest 
ancestors helps to show that these ape-like hominds flourished for at least 
900,000 years without change. 
</P>
<P>
 200,000 years ago: New dating of a fossil skull suggests that the oldest forms 
of Homo sapiens in Asia might be more than 200,000 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 1.8 million years ago: More precise dating this year revealed that fossils in 
Java of Homo erectus -- the first hominid to leave Africa -- are twice as old 
as previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
 Evolving Theories 
</P>
<P>
 OUT OF AFRICA THEORY 
</P>
<P>
 This theory is based on dating evidence that showed oldest Homo erectus 
fossils in Africa to be 2 million years old, with similar fossils in Java only 
800,00 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 The spread of Homo erectus began as much as 1.8 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Homo sapiens' expansion began around 100,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 MULTIREGIONAL HYPOTHESIS 
</P>
<P>
 Better dating shows that the fossils in both places are about the same age, 
suggesting these hominds either left Africa a million years earlier or evolved 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Regional populations of Homo erectus may have evolved into Homo sapiens while 
intermingling with one another. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fossil Record 
</P>
<P>
 The first almost complete afarensis skull was found in the Hadar region of 
Ethiopia, left, about a mile from the famous "Lucy" skeleton. Researchers use 
precise argon dating to read the age of volcanic deposits, and thus determine 
the place in time of fossils found there.

 It might as well have been a gallows that French troops erected when they 
repositioned metal barriers between the shell-pocked Hapsburg buildings of 
Marijin Dvor to protect defenseless strollers from Serbian sniper fire. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly two months, it had been reasonably safe to walk across the historic 
central district that is now one of the Bosnian war's many wastelands. The 
threat of NATO air strikes in February had cowed the Serbian nationalist 
sharpshooters into compliance with a shaky but inspiring cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the U.N. Protection Force last week laid bare its helplessness in 
collapsing Gorazde, Serbian gunmen have brazenly resumed their campaign of 
terror against civilians, piercing the silence with the crack of rifle fire 
directed at pedestrians and shattering illusions that Sarajevo was being spared 
further shelling and fears of conquest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel now that Sarajevo is not safe anymore. We can only wait and watch for 
the shelling to begin again," Jasminka Filipovic, a disillusioned 
businesswoman, said of the return of mortar, machine-gun and sniper fire. "We 
are all rather depressed because we have lost hope once again." 
</P>
<P>
 Secretaries making their way to work must again dodge and dart through the 
blighted landscape. Children have been recalled to inner courtyards for fear of 
bombs and bullets tearing through the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Water, electricity and gas -- unaccustomed luxuries until two months ago -- 
are once again switched on and off at the whim of encircling rebels.

<P>
 Bosnians thought they were inured to hardship and had become deeply cynical 
after two years of siege and of indifference from the outside world. But, 
confronted with the harsh reality of being finally and willfully abandoned in 
Gorazde, they have been surprised to find reserves in what they thought was an 
exhausted capacity for disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 They find little comfort in the fact that they are not alone in their 
dejection. Nor is there solace to be found in their tiny country's tragedy 
having shaken the conscience of the civilized world. 
</P>
<P>
 That U.N. troops are now hostages -- as much as Sarajevans are -- is no cause 
for compassion. After two years of enduring the Serbs' daily deliveries of 
horror and degradation, even the educated and once-tolerant people of Sarajevo 
have lost all sense of pity. 
</P>
<P>
 No one revels in the troops' suffering. But neither are many disturbed by it. 
A taste of their own bad medicine is the way most view the ineffectual disaster 
the peacekeeping mission has made for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time, these troops are in the same position as the Bosnian 
people. They now know what it's like to be surrounded by tanks and artillery 
and have no means of defending yourself," said Edvin Ferizovic, a noted 
violinist and conductor who traveled widely before the siege began. 
</P>
<P>
 The handful of foreign diplomats posted to Sarajevo, U.N. troops who wanted to 
make a difference, aid workers and journalists who ignored personal risk to 
work in the war zone -- all now find themselves consumed by morose 
soul-searching over what the past two years of work have been for. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not very proud to be a peacekeeper today," a French officer said, 
wavering between shame and outrage at the mission's ignominious retreat. "There 
are all of five tanks attacking Gorazde, and before this 'force' the whole 
world trembles." 
</P>
<P>
 A Western diplomat, stunned by the international community's apparent 
willingness to abandon Bosnian civilians to the marauding rebels, shook his 
head in disbelief, conceding, "It's all over." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Serbian nationalist steamroller still has a few unconquered enclaves 
to flatten en route to creating a Greater Serbia, an atmosphere of defeat has 
pervaded this ruined capital as the U.N. mission has made unmistakably clear 
that it would make no move to prevent the fall of Gorazde. One of six 
U.N.-designated safe areas created to subdue pressure for military intervention 
a year ago, Gorazde has come to symbolize the collapse of Western honor in the 
face of defiant nationalist resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 Unchallenged in their chilling assault on refugee-packed shelters, a hospital 
and the token handful of U.N. troops sent to monitor Gorazde, the rebels are 
widely expected to rout the largely Muslim enclave and then move on to Zepa and 
Srebrenica to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the Muslim communities have been overrun, many here in this already 
battered, demoralized capital expect the emboldened conquerors to return for 
the most desirable morsel. 
</P>
<P>
 An appeal to the U.N. Security Council has been made for a mandate that would 
allow blue-helmeted troops to better protect themselves and Bosnian civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 But the slow wheels of the world body's bureaucracy are unlikely to grind into 
motion soon enough to give the mission the authority or the means to fulfill 
its ambitious orders. And the people of Bosnia know the face-saving routine of 
toothless resolutions all too well. 
</P>
<P>
 The 65,000 people of Gorazde have been herded like cattle into the town center 
and fired on relentlessly to ensure they will be eager to flee when relief 
agencies are invited by Serbs to rescue the terrified masses. And by moving out 
the vanquished in an attempt to save their lives, the U.N. troops will be 
assisting in the reviled rebel program of "ethnic cleansing." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got nothing left to do here but hang our heads in shame," a British 
officer said. "We might as well go home now. We've done enough damage here."

U.N. ASKS BACKING FOR WIDER BOSNIA AIR RAIDS; BALKANS: CLINTON IS EXPECTED TO 
APPROVE TODAY. POLICY WOULD PERMIT NATO STRIKES AT SERBS ATTACKING SAFE AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The United Nations asked the United States and its allies Monday to agree to 
wider air strikes to protect Gorazde and other besieged towns in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and President Clinton is expected to approve the request 
today, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said he formally asked the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization to provide air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces 
if they attack any of six Bosnian towns that the United Nations has named safe 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Administration official said the U.N. request was made with American 
encouragement; Clinton is expected to endorse it after a meeting with his 
foreign policy advisers this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry also discussed the question of Bosnia on 
Monday, disclosing that the Administration is revamping its policy and will 
announce a plan for "vigorous action" -- possibly including stepped-up military 
operations -- later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said policy-makers are considering both diplomatic and military 
measures, among them the possibility of lifting the international embargo on 
arms sales to the Bosnian Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 "There'll be a new set of actions -- no question about that," he told 
reporters during a trip from Washington to South Korea to review the military 
situation there. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior defense official said later that the Administration is not 
contemplating entering the war in force in an effort to defeat the Serbs. But 
it was clear from Perry's remarks that some new military action is possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The new mandate sought by Boutros-Ghali, which must also be approved by the 15 
other NATO governments, would significantly widen the circumstances under which 
American, British and other Western air power might be used in Bosnia. NATO 
officials are expected to meet Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, NATO has agreed only to provide "close air support" to U.N. forces 
under attack in Bosnia. In practice, Western commanders interpreted that 
mandate as restricting their targets to specific units that were directly 
endangering U.N. forces. As a result, when NATO launched air strikes against 
Bosnian Serb units attacking Gorazde, the effort was too small and too late to 
be effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed guideline, the United Nations could ask for NATO air 
strikes against any Bosnian Serb forces attacking the safe areas, whether U.N. 
forces are present or not. "This goes well beyond what we have done until now," 
a senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate aim of the new expansion of NATO's role in the war is to persuade 
the Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Muslims to stop fighting and return to peace 
negotiations, officials said. "The idea is . . . to put together a diplomatic 
approach with a tougher use of force," the senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear whether more air power could be effective in saving Gorazde, 
where Bosnian Serb forces are already inside the town and Muslim defenses are 
crumbling. The U.N. commander on the ground, Britain's Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, 
said Monday that air strikes would accomplish little without ground forces to 
hold territory. 
</P>
<P>
 But senior U.S. officials were still discussing a proposal to revive a 
cease-fire agreement that Bosnian Serb leaders had agreed to last week, only to 
break it almost immediately. Under that plan, Serbian forces would withdraw 
from Gorazde and its immediate area and the city would be disarmed and placed 
under U.N. protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not writing off Gorazde," one Administration official insisted. But he 
described the city, crammed with an estimated 65,000 terrified refugees, as 
primarily "a humanitarian problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the wider mandate for air power fails to save Gorazde, other officials 
said, it could help protect five other safe areas: Sarajevo, Tuzla, Bihac, Zepa 
and Srebrenica. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, the procedure for ordering air strikes would be unchanged. 
The U.N. commander, Rose, would submit a request to the civilian chief of the 
U.N. mission in Bosnia, Yasushi Akashi. If Akashi approved the request, he 
would forward it to NATO headquarters, and NATO's commander in the area, U.S. 
Adm. Jeremy Boorda, would oversee its implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 American officials said they have no complaints about the way that process has 
worked in the past two weeks -- after an initial misstep last month when the 
first request for an air strike to protect U.N. troops took more than three 
hours to arrive at NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they said, the factors limiting use of air power at Gorazde have been 
the narrow terms of NATO's mandate to protect U.N. forces and the difficulty of 
operating high-speed aircraft in mountainous, often foggy terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 After a day of private talks with the United States and other members of the 
U.N. Security Council, Boutros-Ghali announced his proposal late Monday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sent a letter to the secretary general of NATO (requesting an agreement) 
allowing the United Nations to use air strikes to protect the different free 
zones in the former Yugoslavia," he said. "We have the right to use air 
support, but we need special permission of the members of NATO to use air 
strikes, which is different." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright said she supported the proposal. Yuli 
Vorontsov, Russia's U.N. ambassador, said he opposed allowing U.N. officials to 
call for "indiscriminate and automatic air strikes." But he did not take any 
formal action against the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's foreign policy advisers discussed the proposal at a White House 
meeting that lasted more than two hours, and National Security Adviser Anthony 
Lake briefed the President on the plan Monday evening after Clinton returned 
from a day in Milwaukee, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The President planned to discuss details of the proposal directly with his 
advisers at a rare meeting of the National Security Council this morning, they 
said. "We have to find a way to get the momentum back . . . for the peace 
effort," Clinton said early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Administration appeared torn -- as it has for months -- between its 
desire to halt the tragedy in Bosnia and its fear of getting sucked into an 
escalating military commitment there. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said one encouraging point was the vocal anger of Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev and his special negotiator in Bosnia over the Serbs' 
violation of several cease-fire agreements that the Russians negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could be helpful," a State Department official said. "Up to now, the 
Russians have been acting as the Serbs' protectors. This time they may feel a 
need to teach the Serbs a lesson."

FED HIKE IS LIKELY TO SLOW RATE OF STATE'S RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board may think higher short-term interest rates are good 
for the long-term health of the nation's economy, but they spell bad news for 
Los Angeles businessman Leonard Rabinowitz. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabinowitz, co-chairman of California Fashion Industries, the Los 
Angeles-based maker of Carole Little brand women's apparel, said higher rates 
have played an important role in forcing him to postpone a planned expansion of 
his downtown Los Angeles factory. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the Fed added to the pressure on Rabinowitz by raising short-term 
interest rates a quarter of a percentage point -- the third such hike since 
early February. 
</P>
<P>
 Every quarter-percentage point hike in rates could add as much as $75,000 in 
costs to California Fashion's revolving credit line of $30 million. "Rising 
interest rates mean higher expenses and less opportunity for investment," 
Rabinowitz said Monday. "It's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
 In California, as consumers and businesses alike are trying to nurture the 
flickering flame of economic recovery, continuing increases in interest rates 
nationwide are an ill wind, whatever their effect on the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Some business people fear that higher rates could cool demand for consumer 
credit, affect purchases of everything from cars to stereos and -- most 
important -- chill the recovery in California's real estate market, whose 
rebound is considered crucial to the state's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 As that market slows, industries from banking to retail home repair can expect 
to feel the ripples. 
</P>
<P>
 For individual Californians, like public relations specialist Linda Smith 
Frost, the higher rates in recent weeks have meant lost opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost -- who returned to work 18 months ago after a year's layoff -- had held 
off refinancing her Mar Vista home's adjustable rate mortgage, whose rate had 
fallen sharply in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Frost feels she may have waited too long. She's planning to refinance in 
the next couple of weeks, but believes higher rates won't improve her cash flow 
as much as it might have. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should have refinanced two months ago instead of now," she says. "I'm 
disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, some executives say the ultimate effects of interest rate hikes 
are still unclear. The Fed's strategy of bumping up rates -- first in February 
and most recently on Monday -- is intended to head off inflation in the rest of 
the nation, where the economy is growing robustly. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is how much rising rates will hurt California, which is still in 
the early stages of economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "A dampening of confidence gives people a reason to put off a purchase, and if 
an interest rate hike gives them that reason, that will be more important than 
the actual effect of a quarter of point of interest," said Robert A. Gunst, 
president and chief executive officer of The Good Guys, the San Francisco-based 
chain of electronics stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, the Fed's action will raise the so-called federal funds rate -- 
the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans -- a quarter of a 
percentage point to 3.75%, signaling an increase in other short-term rates that 
will affect consumer loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest hike in short-term rates could also signal further sustained rises 
in long-term rates, such as mortgage rates, as reflected in trading on the bond 
markets. On Monday, yields on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond rose to 
7.42% -- the highest level since the week before President Clinton's 
inauguration -- from 7.28% Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 California's economy had started to turn around, spurred in part by historic 
low mortgages and other interest rates, as well as by a short-term boom in 
construction following January's Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 A record wave of home mortgage refinancings, meanwhile, freed a lot of cash 
for homeowners to spend on new furniture, refrigerators and televisions. 
</P>
<P>
 George Collins, a real estate agent in the Brentwood office of Jon Douglas 
Realtors, said sales last month were double those of a year ago, due mainly to 
low interest rates. Rising rates "will definitely encourage the buyers . . . to 
sit back and watch the market a little more." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Abo, a mortgage broker in West Los Angeles, says that rising rates have 
cut his brokerage's level of refinancings by 20%. Others have reported a 
drop-off of up to 80%. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are fewer people who benefit from a refinance overall," Abo said. "That 
doesn't mean business isn't good. It's still good, but not what it was over 
that last couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
 At HomeBase Inc., the Irvine-based chain of home-improvement stores, the 
recent uptick in new-home sales helped bring in new customers, said President 
Allan Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it's unclear what the rising rates will do to sales, he said, adding: "I 
wish we all had a crystal ball to see how people react to this." 
</P>
<P>
 Rising rates are also likely to affect borrowing by the state of California, 
said Ted Gibson, principal economist with the state Department of Finance. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, rates on tax-exempt bonds have risen nearly a percentage point since 
the beginning of the year, Gibson said. For every $1 billion of state debt, a 
one-percentage-point increase means an additional $10 million a year in 
interest costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the state has a total of $6.3 billion in potential debt authorized but 
not yet issued in the form of tax-exempt bonds, the additional costs could be 
significant for a state still struggling to balance its budget. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Saturn automobile dealership in Torrance, general manager Kevin Kenney 
said that rising rates have so far had little effect on sales. But, he added: 
"Common sense would tell us as interest rates go up, people will start to be 
fearful of making large purchases." 
</P>
<P>
 John Wilson, chief economist for BankAmerica Corp. in San Francisco, said he 
expects further rate increases, probably at the Fed's May meeting, as the 
nation's central bank tries to slow the rapid growth and keep inflation under 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason the Fed is raising interest rates is that it is trying to engineer 
a 'soft landing' for the (national) economy, to bring about 2.5% growth in 
1995," Wilson noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The ironic and unfortunate part of this is that the national economy is not 
generating significant growth in income or jobs, he said. And in California, 
"we're vulnerable," he added. "We're lagging the national economy by one year."

ZULU LEADER NEARS DEAL TO END S. AFRICA VOTE BOYCOTT; ELECTIONS: BUTHELEZI 
HINTS OF ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY. ACCORD WOULD HELP HALT VIOLENCE IN NATAL PROVINCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi appeared on the verge Monday of making 
a deal that could end months of battles with the government and the African 
National Congress and lift the biggest remaining obstacle to this nation's 
first all-race elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In a surprise six-hour meeting, Buthelezi, President Frederik W. de Klerk and 
ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa hammered out broad outlines of an 
agreement to end the Inkatha Freedom Party's boycott of next week's elections 
and, South Africans hope, help bring peace to the warring people in Natal 
province. 
</P>
<P>
 Details were sketchy, and negotiators, worried about scuttling the accord in 
its infancy, were reluctant to say too much publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 But sources said that if ANC President Nelson Mandela agrees to the deal 
worked out by his negotiators, he will interrupt a campaign swing through the 
eastern Cape province and return to join the talks, due to resume today. And, 
late Monday, ANC officials in the Cape said Mandela was headed back to 
Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
 "The discussions have gone very well," a smiling Buthelezi told reporters on 
the steps outside De Klerk's office in Pretoria. And he added that "we may have 
something positive to announce" today. 
</P>
<P>
 Government and ANC officials also sounded optimistic, though they noted that 
only a week remains before the nationwide voting begins next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time is running out, but there is always time to find solutions," De Klerk 
said. Added Ramaphosa: "We are dealing with very sensitive matters, as you all 
know. And we are trying everything to see what is possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Hopes of a breakthrough in the impasse with Inkatha have been raised and 
dashed time and again in recent months, but Buthelezi's position had hardened 
and the killing continued. Since De Klerk declared a state of emergency in 
Natal on March 31, almost 240 people have been killed there in attacks and 
counterattacks by supporters of Inkatha and the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
 An international mediation team, headed by former Secretary of State Henry A. 
Kissinger, gave up before it could even start its work last week when the 
parties could not agree on the ground rules for their talks. 
</P>
<P>
 But political analysts saw important differences this time. For one thing, 
Buthelezi made a major shift Monday in his bargaining position, backing down, 
for example, from his demand that the April 26-28 elections be postponed; that 
demand had sent the international mediation team packing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there is any possibility of postponing the elections," 
Buthelezi said. "I would prefer a postponement, but I am a realist." 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi also apparently abandoned his insistence that the homeland of 
KwaZulu, which he controls, be given full autonomy under the Zulu king, 
Goodwill Zwelithini -- Buthelezi's nephew. 
</P>
<P>
 The ANC has said it will give the Zulu monarchy greater powers and privileges 
as well as a secure place in the country's new constitution. But the ANC and 
the government have refused to grant autonomy to the old Zulu kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said another positive sign was the decision of the Inkatha Youth 
Brigade to cancel a workers strike planned for today. Earlier, it had canceled 
plans to stage a march Monday to ANC headquarters in Johannesburg, which the 
police had declared illegal. But, taking no chances, police put up razor wire 
around the ANC building Monday and blocked off roads in part of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "When there are discussions, there is always hope," said Roelf Meyer, the 
government constitutional affairs minister who joined the talks Monday. And De 
Klerk said he hoped "something constructive will come out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The only way to end the violence in South Africa is to remove its underlying 
cause, De Klerk said. In the past, he has identified that cause as the long 
rivalry between Inkatha and the ANC, which has resulted in 20,000 deaths in 
Natal province in the past decade. "We must remove that if we really want to 
bring reconciliation and peace to our country," the president said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the talks were continuing Monday, violence flared anew in townships 
near Johannesburg. In Thokoza, southeast of Johannesburg, Inkatha supporters 
holed up in a hostel exchanged fire with ANC "self-defense units" and members 
of the new National Peacekeeping Force, deployed in the region just three days 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those killed Monday was Ken Oosterbroek, 31, a photographer for the Star 
newspaper in Johannesburg who last week was named South Africa's photographer 
of the year. Hospital officials said he died of a broken neck while running for 
cover from gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 Oosterbroek was the second journalist killed this year in South Africa. 
Another photographer, Greg Marinovich, a free-lancer for Newsweek magazine who 
won a Pulitzer Prize in 1991, was seriously wounded by gunfire but was reported 
in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The resurgence of violence in Thokoza was a worrying development. A full 
return of the ANC-Inkatha war to the country's largest urban area, which has 
been relatively quiet for months, could seriously damage the credibility of 
next week's voting -- the first all-race elections in 350 years of white 
domination. 
</P>
<P>
 It also marked a rocky beginning for the blue-uniformed National Peacekeeping 
Force, a unit of former ANC guerrillas and government army soldiers formed to 
combat township unrest. More than 1,400 of the heavily armed peacekeepers, 
riding armored vehicles, had been deployed in the region to replace South 
African Defense Force units. Army units were sent back into the area late 
Monday to restore peace. 
</P>
<P>
 If Buthelezi decides that Inkatha will participate in the election, it will 
raise difficult logistic problems for the Independent Electoral Commission. 
Most of the 80 million ballots, for example, already have been printed -- 
without Inkatha's name on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it might be too late for Buthelezi to be included on national 
ballots, the party could possibly contest elections for the regional government 
in Natal province. Analysts say the ANC and the government, while steadfastly 
opposed to postponing the election, might be willing to delay regional voting 
in Natal. 
</P>
<P>
 Natal includes the KwaZulu homeland. But after the elections, KwaZulu will 
become part of South Africa, and Buthelezi's administration, including his 
police force, will be dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows for sure whether Inkatha could muster a credible election 
campaign in the short time remaining. Some political analysts say Inkatha 
supporters might be confused by the sudden change in direction. But the party, 
which claims 2 million members, is a fairly cohesive group with a network of 
local chiefs who could get the word out quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent public opinion polls in Natal, where Inkatha is strongest, indicate 
that about 50% of potential voters support the ANC, compared with 25% for 
Inkatha and 19% for De Klerk's National Party. If Inkatha does not participate, 
analysts have said, at least some of its supporters might vote for the National 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Inkatha's vow to boycott the election has cast doubt on the ability of 
election monitors to stage a free, fair poll in Natal province, Buthelezi's 
home base and scene of years of bloody ethnic and political conflict. Many 
people in Natal have said they fear casting ballots in the region, where 26 
people died in political violence over the weekend. Some worry that Inkatha 
supporters might attack polling stations and burn homes of people who leave on 
election days to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, election officials planned to open 1,600 polling stations in the 
province. But the police and army complained that their force of 2,000 could 
not adequately guard so many sites. The number has since been reduced to about 
1,000, mostly schools in the region. But the security forces said Monday that 
they would like to see the number brought down to 750.

SERBS USING U.N. AS A COVER, SAYS MISSION LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia condemned Serbian nationalists Monday 
for using his peacekeeping mission as a cover for waging war and warned that 
the fall of Gorazde would unleash a humanitarian disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose said his 15,000-strong peacekeeping force is 
helpless to save the overrun city, and he dismissed the likelihood of further 
NATO air strikes to halt the slaughter by the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose said that nothing could be gained without ground forces to hold territory 
that might be recovered if the rebels were driven back with air power. He also 
made clear that he is opposed to having his troops transformed from impartial 
peacekeepers to combatants in the lopsided war. 
</P>
<P>
 In a further indication that the international community suffers paralyzing 
confusion over what to do in Bosnia, senior U.N. military officials have 
concluded that Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader negotiating with 
Western mediators, exercises little if any control over the Serbian gunmen 
under the command of Gen. Ratko Mladic. 
</P>
<P>
 The fiery nationalist general's rampage against Gorazde is believed to be 
occurring on orders from Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade, the 
Yugoslav capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mladic has taken the upper hand, and Karadzic is extremely shattered. He saw 
himself as a statesman, and he is now a running dog for a warmonger," said a 
senior U.N. source. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's special envoy for the Balkans, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly S. 
Churkin, also seemed to have concluded that the Bosnian Serb military machine 
is out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 "A group of Bosnian Serb extremists has fallen ill with the madness of war," 
Churkin told reporters in Zagreb, Croatia, after more than a week of shuttling 
among Serbian leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The renegade and seemingly uncontrollable assault on Gorazde, despite promises 
by Karadzic to call off the onslaught, prompted Rose to accuse the rebels of 
manipulation and deceit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very sad week for the world when United Nations peacekeeping 
operations have been so blatantly used to cover the prosecution of war aims by 
the Bosnian Serb authorities," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Gorazde was at the mercy of the Serbian forces besieging it and 
conceded that the U.N. Protection Force could do virtually nothing to prevent 
its fall. He blamed the mission's crippling rules of engagement -- which allow 
peacekeeping troops to use force against combatants only when their own lives 
are threatened -- for his inability to spare the 65,000 residents of the 
U.N.-protected safe area of Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven U.N. special forces officers who had been deployed to the besieged town 
escaped back to Sarajevo under cover of night, further handcuffing the 
mission's ability to call in North Atlantic Treaty Organization warplanes to 
bomb Serbian positions. Five U.N. military observers and eight relief officials 
are now the only foreigners left in Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources at the Sarajevo command center say Rose is pressing U.N. superiors for 
a tougher mandate, one that would create weapons exclusion zones around Gorazde 
and other vulnerable safe areas. As in the demilitarized zone proclaimed around 
Sarajevo in February, the threat of NATO air strikes would hang over the Serbs 
if they refused to remove heavy weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Time appeared to be running out, though, for the anguished people of Gorazde. 
Relief agency officials described a scene of savagery and panic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shells are now dropping at random into the city center. The hospital has 
taken direct hits on its roof. The (International Committee of the Red Cross) 
refugee center is hit," with many casualties, four stranded workers of the U.N. 
high commissioner for refugees reported from the raging battle zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Agency spokesman Kris Janowski said the Gorazde team counted at least five 
tank rounds crashing into or near the overcrowded hospital and described the 
bombardment as fierce, with shells landing every 20 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extremely alarming. We are very concerned about the fate of all the 
people in Gorazde. There are tens of thousands of people massed in the city," 
Janowski said, estimating the displaced at 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But evacuations to ease the overcrowding -- caused by those who have fled 
overrun villages and suburbs during the 20-day assault -- are out of the 
question until the besieging forces agree to halt fire long enough to allow the 
organization of a rescue operation, Janowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief workers in this battered capital, already exhausted by two years of 
trying to aid innocent victims in the midst of ongoing war, are in a quandary 
over how to help the displaced of Gorazde when, or if, the attacks die down. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Serbian gunmen rolling up territory for a Greater Serbia waged a 
similar assault on the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica, forcing humanitarian aid 
agencies to evacuate thousands of civilians to government-held territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaotic stampedes resulted when open trucks arrived to haul out terrified 
civilians, with at least six women and children crushed to death before the 
evacuations were called off after the United Nations designated Srebrenica a 
safe area. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. mission's civilian chief, Yasushi Akashi of Japan, returned to his 
headquarters in Zagreb on Monday after repeated failures to secure genuine 
commitment by the rebel leaders to a proposed cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Viktor Andreyev, the Russian civilian affairs chief, visited rebel 
headquarters in nearby Pale to discuss another truce proposal and claimed to 
have won Karadzic's support for deploying a company of U.N. troops to Gorazde 
as well as allowing unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian commitments to cease-fires have proven unreliable, however, as Mladic 
presses on with the land-grab while Karadzic strikes an agreeable pose. 
</P>
<P>
 As the world watched the relentless Serbian offensive, few outsiders were as 
dismayed as the Russians, whose claim of influence over their Slavic brothers 
was shattered by the guns they could not silence. Moscow appeared to be 
re-examining its opposition to punishing the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Churkin, the Russian envoy, returned abruptly to Moscow on Monday, saying 
Russia had been manipulated and should break off talks with Serbian leaders. 
"The time for talks is over now," he declared. "The Bosnian Serbs must 
understand that when they deal with Russia, they are dealing with a great world 
power and not a banana republic." 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks appeared to signal at least a change of attitude, if not of 
policy, in Moscow. Russia had opposed NATO bombing attacks on Serbian forces 
and was incensed at not being consulted in advance about the raids last week. 
And Russia had repeatedly called for a gradual lifting of U.N.-backed economic 
and military sanctions against Serbia in exchange for steps toward a 
cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Churkin, a special envoy of President Boris N. Yeltsin who had spent the last 
nine days in Belgrade, said Monday that the Bosnian situation "can hardly be 
controlled" or "explained in any reasonable or logical terms." He said the 
place was "on the brink of catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving in Moscow, he gave this analysis: "Russia's policy used to come down 
to a simple formula -- when the Serbs would say that the entire world was up in 
arms against them and they were to be helped, we agreed on the condition that 
they would follow our instructions. Instead, the Serbs are using Russia's 
policy as a screen." 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian envoy indicated he was ready to recommend that Yeltsin support new 
NATO air strikes on Serbian positions. That would be a risky position for the 
Russian president, who could face an outcry of ultranationalist and centrist 
opposition at home in the event of new bombings. Also, the Russians are as 
reluctant as the West to engage their peacekeeping troops in a ground war in 
the former Yugoslav federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, in Sarajevo, almost 2,000 people demonstrated against U.N. 
capitulation to Serbian aggression, accusing Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali of abandoning them to a brutal fate. "We have learned our 
lesson," Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic told the aggrieved, angry crowd. 
"The lesson is we have to be strong, because in this world only force is 
respected." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200,000 people are dead or missing since Serbian nationalists 
rebelled against Bosnian independence in March, 1992. They have since conquered 
70% of the country.

MARINES' PLANS TO LEAVE EL TORO BY 1996 DISCLOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Marines have plans to begin leaving El Toro Marine Corps Air Station on 
July 1 and hope to be out by 1996, more than three years ahead of the scheduled 
October, 1999, closure date. 
</P>
<P>
 A "migration plan" of Marine units at El Toro shows that three units are to 
begin moving to Miramar Naval Air Station in San Diego by July 1 and be 
completely in place by Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine spokesman Col. Dan Pender declined Monday to provide details about the 
earlier departure from El Toro, saying only: "We want to start moving this 
summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Documents obtained by The Times show there are several hurdles complicating 
the move to Miramar, including a lack of Marine funding for the relocation, 
questions about the environmental impact of helicopter operations at the jet 
base, and finding housing for Marines and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Navy headquarters in Washington is studying the possibility of 
consolidating Marine and naval FA-18 squadrons on the West Coast at a base in 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Pender said relocation "plans change literally from day to day." In an 
interview last week, he said the Marines planned to be at Miramar "before 
1999." 
</P>
<P>
 "The quicker we can move down, the quicker we can close (El Toro), reduce 
maintenance and save money. Our plan right now is that we need to be gone by 
1999. If we can get the funding to accomplish this sooner, we will," Pender 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A military source familiar with plans to move the Marine units, mostly FA-18 
squadrons, to Miramar said the Marines are also studying the possibility of 
moving even sooner, possibly as early as May. The migration plan obtained by 
The Times shows that the Marines plan to complete the move from El Toro by 
March 1, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a meeting at Miramar in January, where the Marines told the Navy 
they had been instructed by their headquarters in Washington to begin the move 
to Miramar" as soon as possible, said the source, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 The big issue for the Marine departure, Pender said, is getting funding for 
the move. The corps has "absolutely zero" in funding this year to make the move 
from El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no approved plan, no funded plan," he said. "Right now headquarters 
(in Washington) is working on the money issue with the Navy and trying to 
obtain funding for the move." 
</P>
<P>
 Documents show that the Navy had planned as early as December, 1993, to turn 
Miramar completely over to the Marines by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "Currently, (Miramar) is envisioned to be realigned to the USMC in fiscal year 
'97. At that time the installation will become a Marine Corps Air Station," 
said a Dec. 15, 1993, Navy memo. The 1997 fiscal year will begin on Oct. 1, 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Navy has worried about problems the Marines are having in keeping 
the schedule. Another Navy memo in December complained that the Marines' plans 
to begin moving to Miramar in 1994 "shift with the tide. . . . One week, (it 
is) execute as quickly as possible . . . next week delay movements until fiscal 
year '95." 
</P>
<P>
 A source familiar with the memo said the Marines' "on-again, off-again 
approach to the move" is dictated by the uncertainty of the Defense Department 
funding to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The memo also warned that an environmental impact study being done on the 
transfer of 138 helicopters from El Toro and the Marine air station in Tustin 
to Miramar may be a "potential showstopper." 
</P>
<P>
 Pender said the Marine environmental study of Miramar began in October and 
will take between 18 months and two years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "Federal law says we have to move from El Toro and Tustin. I don't know what 
will happen if the (environmental) study says we can't do that," Pender said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, there are no helicopters at Miramar, which is used exclusively by Navy 
fixed-wing aircraft, mostly F-14 fighters and a few FA-18 attack fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Another potential problem in the move is where to house the Marines and their 
families once they move to Miramar, Pender said, noting that the Marines will 
give up 2,727 housing units at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 The source, who is familiar with the Navy's plans to vacate Miramar, said Navy 
officials informed the Marines that the Navy will not give up any of its 
Miramar housing.

STATE ACTS TO CUT USE OF BRASS IN WELL PUMPS; CONTAMINATION: A LAWSUIT IS FILED 
TO BAN SALE OF SUCH EQUIPMENT IN CALIFORNIA AFTER A STUDY FINDS HIGH LEVELS OF 
LEAD. EPA ADVISES THOSE WITH PRIVATE WELLS TO DRINK BOTTLED WATER UNTIL 
SUPPLIES ARE TESTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A new study that found high levels of lead in the components of household 
wells led state and federal officials Monday to take action to reduce the 
exposure of the estimated 6 million households that get their water from 
private wells with brass-fitted pumps. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued an advisory urging people who 
installed new household well pumps during the past year to use bottled drinking 
water until they can have their well water tested. The research showed that 
brass fittings on submersible well pumps are capable of leaching high levels of 
lead into well water. The study examined new pumps in a laboratory, leaving 
open the question of contamination by brass pumps that have been in the ground 
for months or longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Prolonged exposure to lead is believed to cause brain damage and birth 
defects. Pregnant women, infants and young children are particularly 
susceptible. In the past, lead in drinking water has been traced to faucets and 
other brass plumbing fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference in Los Angeles on Monday, the state attorney general's 
office and two environmental groups, the Environmental Defense Fund and Natural 
Resources Defense Council, said they were filing a lawsuit to block further 
sales of brass well pumps in California. 
</P>
<P>
 In their lawsuit, the environmental groups, who sponsored the testing, demand 
that pump manufacturers replace brass pumps with plastic or stainless steel 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 At the news conference, Deputy Atty. Gen. Ed Weil said two pump manufacturers 
have agreed to stop selling brass well pumps in the state and that one of the 
manufacturers is recalling all stock from suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for one manufacturer, Sta-Rite Industries of Delavan, Wis., 
confirmed that the company is replacing its California stock with pumps that 
meet state standards. Rick Heine, the firm's communications manager, said that 
the company had no plans to stop selling brass pumps in other states. 
</P>
<P>
 Heine said tests by Sta-Rite indicated that the firm's brass pumps met federal 
standards for lead contamination but did not pass muster under California's 
tougher standards. Under federal law, the maximum contamination limit for lead 
in drinking water is 15 parts per billion, while in California the limit is 0.5 
parts per billon. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, under Proposition 65 -- the Safe Drinking Water and Toxics 
Enforcement Act -- California officials have more regulatory authority than 
most other states and more than the federal government, which has no 
jurisdiction over private water systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarded as one of the most dangerous forms of toxic contamination, lead has 
been the target of several lawsuits by Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren against makers of 
ceramic tableware, lead-foil wine bottle caps, crystal decanters and 
residential faucets. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential for well water contamination in California, where only about 1% 
of the population gets its water from private wells, is far less than in many 
other states. In some states, as much as 30% of the population depends on water 
from private wells. 
</P>
<P>
 According to U.S. census figures, more than 12 million American families draw 
their drinking water from private wells. The majority of these wells are in the 
South and Midwest. About half of those wells are believed to be powered by 
underwater pumps that can leach directly into the water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for the two environmental groups said that only a small minority of 
the submersible pumps in use are made without brass parts. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest study found that the most commonly used pumps in household wells 
contaminate drinking water up to 500 times greater than safe limits under 
federal law and thousands of times of what is permissible in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are giant time-release capsules for lead," said David Roe of the 
Environmental Defense Fund, referring to the brass pumps. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-day laboratory study of four brass pumps revealed initial high levels 
of contamination -- nearly 8,000 parts per billion in one pump -- that dropped 
significantly over the first few days, but at a low of 223 parts per billion 
was still well above safe drinking water levels by the end of that period. A 
fifth stainless steel pump that did not contain brass had lead levels of 1.7 on 
the first day to 0.5 by the 30th day. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard P. Maas, director of the University of North Carolina's Environmental 
Quality Institute, which did the testing, said additional tests will be 
necessary to show whether pumps in use for long periods continue to be a 
hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials said that although they found no reason to doubt the test 
results, it was unclear whether water moving through a well would be 
contaminated to the same degree as standing water in a laboratory setting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would want to know how much leaching occurs in a real-life situation," 
said Linn Goldmann, EPA's assistant secretary for prevention, pesticides and 
toxic substances. "Is it an episodic burst of lead coming through or is it 
persistent. Until we know more, we think it's advisable for anyone with a pump 
that was installed in the last year to get it tested." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldmann added: "To our knowledge, this is the first time anyone has looked at 
the problem. This finding is the first indication we've had that pumps might be 
a hazard. It stands to reason there would be a problem because we've seen it 
before in the same type of brass." 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA has made available two toll-free telephone numbers to call with 
questions about drinking water and lead: (800) 426-4791 and (800) 424-LEAD. 
Also, the National Resources Defense Council, with offices in Los Angeles and 
San Francisco, and the Oakland-based Environmental Defense Fund can provide the 
names of laboratories that will test well water. The tests cost from $15 to 
$30, according to Meyerhoff. The cost of a new, lead-free pump ranges from $200 
to $300, he said.

STATE SENATE VOTES TO LET PUBLIC SCHOOLS REQUIRE UNIFORMS; EDUCATION: THE 
MEASURE IS BILLED AS AN EFFORT TO DISCOURAGE GANG MEMBERSHIP. CRITICS SAY IT 
WOULD CREATE FRICTION BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN.

<P>
 Legislation giving public school officials the power to require students to 
wear uniforms on campus was approved Monday by the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Billed as an anti-gang measure, the bill was sent to the Assembly on a 28-6 
vote by an unusual coalition of conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, bills that would allow schools to impose uniforms on public 
school children have met hostile receptions in the Legislature. But Sen. Phil 
Wyman (R-Tehachapi), author of the latest bill, said long-held attitudes seem 
to be changing. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the bill (SB 1269), local school boards would be authorized to enact a 
uniform policy agreed on by principals and parents on a school-by-school basis. 
The bill would apply to all grade levels. For poor students, the uniforms would 
be provided by private sources, such as civic groups or parent-teacher 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Students whose parents refused to dress them in uniforms could not be denied 
access to the classroom, according to the bill, but they could be assigned to 
schools that did not require uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyman said the measure is needed because current state law establishing 
student dress codes is unclear on whether the wearing of uniforms is 
authorized. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyman, a conservative, maintained that uniforms have helped students in 
private schools focus on learning by eliminating distractions such as trendy 
and costly clothing. He said officials in some public schools are eager to 
adopt a similar requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Teresa Hughes (D-Inglewood), a liberal who is often at political odds 
with Wyman, signed on as a co-author. She said that uniforms would give 
students a sense of school pride at a time when they are being influenced by 
gangs, while reducing fierce peer pressure to wear expensive fashions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) deplored the wearing of uniforms as a 
"misplaced attempt to regain control over our kids." He said imposition of 
uniforms would serve only to aggravate an "inevitable friction" between 
children and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Another critic, Sen. Charles Calderon (D-Whittier), warned that the bill would 
serve the purposes of conservative Christian activists who, he said, want to 
"impose their puritanical view of life" on public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyman dismissed Calderon's criticism as ridiculous. He said the bill was 
sought by parents and officials of tiny Lamont school district near 
Bakersfield, whose enrollment is mostly Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 He said many of the parents had attended parochial schools as children and 
felt uniforms helped provide a better learning environment. Wyman said those 
parents want their children "to have the opportunity. They (are) concerned 
about gang problems and the safety of their children." 
</P>
<P>
 He said some supporters of public school uniforms believe a uniform has the 
effect of granting a "safe passage" to children wearing a "neutral coat of 
arms" through gang neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyman told the Senate that Lamont administrators wanted to require uniforms, 
but were warned by attorneys that doing so could invite an expensive lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he introduced the bill to give school administrators power to enact a 
uniform requirement without fear of being sued for exceeding their authority. 
He said Long Beach school officials support the bill because they intend to 
require the wearing of uniforms next term.

BROWN AGREES TO 3 DEBATES WITH RIVALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown, buoyed by her performance at the state 
Democratic Party convention over the weekend, agreed for the first time Monday 
to participate in three debates before the June 7 gubernatorial primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi and state Sen. Tom Hayden had 
already accepted an invitation to debate live on a Los Angeles radio station 
May 25. Both Garamendi and Hayden had been pressing Brown to participate in 
more debates. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown campaign officials said Monday that they are attempting to schedule 
televised debates in San Francisco and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming off the convention and the launching of our new theme, it's 
appropriate -- now is the time," said John Whitehurst, Brown's campaign 
spokesman and one of several new staffers announced over the weekend. "We want 
to let her shine against the two men." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi and Hayden had both called for a debate during the convention, but 
state party Chairman Bill Press said the idea was inconsistent with the 
weekend's chosen theme: unity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look forward to debating," said Darry Sragow, Garamendi's campaign 
manager, who offered a theory about why, after months of declining debate 
offers, Brown's campaign suddenly reversed itself. "This confirms that 
irrespective of all their bold statements, they have seen tracking polls and 
they know she's in trouble. . . . They know they have to come out of hiding." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden called Brown's announcement "clearly an attempt to defuse the issue of 
refusing to debate." He remained wary, saying that just because Brown calls for 
a debate "doesn't mean it's going to happen and doesn't mean it won't be a 
cameo appearance played at some obscure hour." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schnur, spokesman for Gov. Pete Wilson's reelection campaign, said he 
looked forward to watching Brown, Garamendi and Hayden go at it. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of them know the first thing about creating jobs or fighting crime or 
cracking down on illegal immigration," he said. "And after three debates, the 
whole world will know it." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Monday, Garamendi's wife, Patti, received a letter of apology from 
California Teachers Assn. President Ralph J. Flynn, who said he regretted 
remarks made to her by CTA political director Alice Huffman on the first day of 
the Democratic convention. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech at a luncheon that day, Huffman had repeatedly lashed out, 
threatening that if John Garamendi did not apologize to her, he would be 
"chopped liver, baby." Huffman was angry about the candidate's charges that she 
had acted inappropriately when she helped Brown prepare for a CTA forum in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn's letter stressed that Huffman had spoken without the consent of the 
CTA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any differences CTA may have with Commissioner Garamendi will be addressed 
directly to him and not through you or any other member of your family," Flynn 
wrote. "As it may appear to the public, and to you, that CTA . . . was 
attempting to convey a message through you, or to personally embarrass you, I 
deeply apologize."

ATTEMPT TO GET RID OF HOME IS BEYOND WORDS 
</P>

 When Melanie Gregory could not find a buyer for her home last fall, she 
decided to give it away. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there was a little gimmick: It would go to the person who wrote the 
best essay beginning with the sentence: "I would like to live in a house in 
Summit Valley because . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 She would charge each person a $50 entry fee, and figured that with about 
6,000 essays, she would get the asking price for her 2,750-square-foot home -- 
$289,000. She and her truck driver husband could leave crazy California for 
laid-back Tennessee, and some lucky writer would win a home, free and clear, 
alongside the San Bernardino National Forest above San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the home giveaway idea was unusual and because Gregory gave 
entertaining interviews, she received generous publicity -- not only throughout 
the United States but in England, Germany, South Africa, Australia, New 
Zealand, Japan, Canada and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think every ex-boyfriend I ever had must have seen me on TV interviews, and 
knows that I've now got two chins," the talk show darling said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her phone rang off the hook with calls from strangers. The post office box was 
filled with hundreds upon hundreds of requests for entry blanks and contest 
rules. Gregory was giddy. She lined up a trust account to hold everyone's 
money; she enlisted a panel of teachers to judge the essays. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all that interest, all the sound bites, it seems that Melanie Gregory 
cannot even give her home away. 
</P>
<P>
 Since September, she has received only 181 entries. Another 1,300 people sent 
in self-addressed envelopes asking for entry forms, but never followed up. 
</P>
<P>
 So Gregory has canceled the contest; her bookkeeper says he will return 
everyone's $50 entry fee by this week and Gregory is going to try to dispose of 
her custom-built home the old-fashioned way. It is listed again with a real 
estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a good cry," Gregory said of her failed contest. "I still think it was 
a great idea. I don't regret having tried it. I just regret that it didn't 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 She is not sure. Maybe people do not like to write essays. Maybe no one wanted 
to live in Summit Valley, across from a llama ranch and just down the street 
from the local bait and beer shop. Maybe they figured $50 would go further with 
the state lottery. Or maybe, Gregory said, the state attorney general's office 
scared everyone off. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the legitimacy and success of several home-giveaway essay contests in 
Maine and elsewhere in the East, California Senior Assistant Atty. Gen. 
Herschel Elkins, who heads the consumer law section, informed every reporter 
who asked that such contests may be illegal in this state. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, Elkins said, is that winning a contest based on writing is based 
on luck rather than skill because judging such essays is so subjective. That 
made the contest a lottery, which is against the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Of about 50 similar contests Elkins' office has heard of, not one has 
generated a winner because none generated enough entries to make it financially 
feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 Elkins' never targeted Gregory's contest for prosecution. There are not enough 
hours in the day to go after everyone, he said. Instead, Elkins filed a civil 
lawsuit against one of the contests to make a point to the others. 
</P>
<P>
 That contest was promoted by a San Francisco woman, a real estate agent who 
was trying to dispose of her mother's home on Los Angeles' Westside, he said. 
Eventually, she conceded in court that she violated the state's Business and 
Professions Code. In exchange for her admission, the state agreed not to assess 
civil penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these contests aren't being run by scam artists. The vast majority 
are persons who can't sell their homes because of the recession, and are simply 
desperate," Elkins said. "And the contests fail because there aren't enough 
suckers out there."

EX-PROFESSOR, GIRLFRIEND ADMIT ABUSING GIRL, 4; CRIME: THE FORMER LOMA LINDA

 Six months after a highly publicized hunt led to their arrest, a former 
university professor and his girlfriend each pleaded guilty Monday to multiple 
felony counts of sexually abusing a 4-year-old Newport Beach girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Ruskjer, 44, a onetime faculty member at Loma Linda University's school 
of public health, pleaded guilty to three counts of sex abuse of a child and 
two counts of taking sexually explicit photographs of a child. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino Deputy Dist. Atty. Frank Vanella said Ruskjer -- who could have 
faced up to 30 years in state prison if convicted in trial -- is expected to 
receive a 12-year term when he is sentenced June 22. 
</P>
<P>
 During a separate appearance later in the day, Ruskjer's girlfriend, Evelyn 
(Evie) Bacilio, 33, a former secretary at a medical equipment company, pleaded 
guilty to two counts each of child sex abuse and taking sexually explicit 
photographs of a child. Vanella said he expects Bacilio to be sentenced to six 
years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The two, who appeared Monday before Superior Court Judge Roberta McPeters, are 
being held on $2 million bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruskjer's attorney, Greg Waitman, said his client was "very remorseful" about 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us at one time or another get involved in something and get carried 
away, and this was just one of those things," Waitman said after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruskjer and Bacilio, who lived in the San Bernardino County community of Grand 
Terrace, were arrested Oct. 8 after dozens of tips led to their identity as 
suspects in the child abuse case. 
</P>
<P>
 The case began to unfold last October when someone turned over to Los Angeles 
police 11 photographs -- four showing a man performing sex acts with a little 
girl, three showing a woman doing the same, and four showing the girl by 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
 The photographs, it was learned later, were thrown out of Ruskjer's car window 
after the car was stolen. Police at the time had no clues to the identity of 
the suspects or the young victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though state law prohibits distributing pictures showing sex with 
children, frustrated police won court permission to publicly release three 
carefully edited photos to the news media, with the hope that someone would 
recognize either the adults or the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of the photographs' broadcast on nightly news programs, police 
received 40 calls identifying Ruskjer and Bacilio as the suspects. But when 
authorities descended on their homes early the next morning, both suspects 
already had fled. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another tipster called to alert the San Bernardino County Sheriff's 
Department to the couple's travel plans. The next day -- within 36 hours of the 
release of the photographs -- Ruskjer was arrested at Detroit Metropolitan 
Airport after landing there on a flight from Tokyo, and Bacilio was arrested at 
McCarran Airport in Las Vegas while preparing to fly to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, other tips had led authorities to the identity of the girl and her 
parents in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruskjer, a divorced father of two, taught health administration to graduate 
students at Loma Linda University from 1988 to 1991. He then joined the San 
Bernardino County health department to help develop public health campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanella said the photographs were taken Jan. 9 at Ruskjer's home while the 
girl's parents were in Palm Springs. The child's parents had asked Bacilio -- 
who worked with the girl's mother -- to babysit. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no indication, Vanella said, that the girl was raped. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victim has absolutely no recollection of what happened that night," 
Vanella said. "We are fairly comfortable there was no physical injury."

LEBANON BREAKS TIES WITH IRAQ OVER KILLING OF DISSIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Lebanon severed diplomatic relations with Iraq on Monday and ordered Baghdad's 
mission in the Lebanese capital to leave within 72 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision followed Iraq's refusal to waive the diplomatic immunity of two 
embassy diplomats allegedly involved in the assassination of a prominent Iraqi 
dissident in Beirut last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebanon rejects any infringement on its sovereignty, security and stability as 
well as the violation of diplomatic rules, Information Minister Michel Samaha 
said after a three-hour special session of the Lebanese Cabinet on Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Iraqis have been held in solitary confinement since Lebanese security 
forces apprehended them last Wednesday. Samaha said the two have admitted 
killing Sheik Taleb Ali Suheil, 64, on direct orders from the Iraqi 
intelligence department in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite official Iraqi denials of any involvement on their part and the demand 
for the men's release, the press speculated Monday that prosecutors will 
proceed with the case against Mohammed Kazem Faris, 37, the Iraqi Embassy 
cultural attache, and Khaled Alwan Khalaf 34, the Iraqi commercial attache. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebanese authorities say the murder weapon, a silencer-equipped pistol, was 
found in the diplomats' car when they were arrested by Lebanese police in front 
of the Iraqi Embassy compound shortly after the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities here also want to interrogate Iraqi Consul Ali Sultan Darwish, 
thought to be the chief intelligence officer at the embassy, on suspicion of 
masterminding the assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 A Lebanese employee at the embassy, George Teredjian, was formally charged 
Friday with complicity in Suheil's killing and is also being held. 
</P>
<P>
 Possible repercussions were hinted at Saturday by Awad Fakhri, the Iraqi 
charge d'affaires at the Beirut embassy. He noted that 12,000 Lebanese live and 
work in Iraq and that they are treated like brothers. Every country should 
think of its interests, Fakhri added. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of this consideration, editorials in Monday's newspapers argued for 
severing ties with the government of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.

SECURITY LIES ONLY IN PEACE, RABIN SAYS; ISRAEL: THE NATION HAS NO TOTAL 
DEFENSE AGAINST RADICALS, PRIME MINISTER ACKNOWLEDGES. HE IMPLORES PEOPLE TO 
SUPPORT TALKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, while seeking to calm the nation after two 
terrorist bombings that have killed 12 Israelis, acknowledged Monday that 
Israel -- despite all its military might -- does not have a total defense 
against attacks by radical Palestinians opposed to Arab-Israeli peace 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The lives of Israelis and Palestinians have become far too integrated to 
untangle, Rabin said, arguing that real security lies only in peace and 
imploring his people to remain with the peace process despite the bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will probably not be able to prevent completely terrorist attacks, but 
peace will be victorious," Rabin told the Knesset, Israel's Parliament, as 
heckling from the opposition Likud Party and other right-wing members rose to a 
roar. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with troop reinforcements along "sovereign Israel's" borders with the 
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, closing Israel to most Palestinians, Rabin 
warned that Israelis would continue to be targets for terrorist attacks by 
Muslim fundamentalists from the Islamic Resistance Movement, known as Hamas, 
and other radicals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hundreds of thousands of Jews and Arabs, thousands of vehicles mix with each 
other every day," Rabin said. "One population lives inside the other. There are 
many ways to cross from the (occupied) territories to Israel, fewer from the 
Gaza Strip, more from the West Bank, some ways are known, others are secret. . 
. . The territories cannot be hermetically sealed." 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Netanyahu, the Likud chairman, replied that since the government and 
the Palestine Liberation Organization signed the Declaration of Principles on 
Palestinian self-government, "the pace of murder and terrorism has been 
multiplied by four." 
</P>
<P>
 "The government has failed in the central mission of every government in 
Israel -- to defend the life of every citizen," Netanyahu declared. "That 
failure is a direct result of (its) policy." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate came just two hours after another terrorist attack. A 17-year-old 
Palestinian from the Kalandiyeh refugee camp outside Jerusalem struck two 
Israelis with an ax while riding on a bus headed toward the capital's northern 
suburbs, police said. An army sergeant major shot and wounded the youth, who 
also had two firebombs, as well as three other Israeli passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafi Peled, Israel's police commissioner, urged more public vigilance, 
especially on buses, after the latest attack. 
</P>
<P>
 In two suicide attacks earlier this month, Hamas bombers killed 12 Israelis 
and wounded 73 people. Hamas said the bombings were in reprisal for a Jewish 
settler's massacre of about 30 Palestinians at a Hebron mosque in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Warning that more attacks are probable, Rabin insisted that peace efforts must 
continue -- and he implied that the bloodshed will end only when Israel 
withdraws from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 27 years, we have ruled another people who do not want us to rule over 
them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 27 years, Palestinians in the territories get up in the morning -- 
Palestinians who today number 1.8 million men and women -- and nurse their 
burning hatred for us as Israelis and as Jews," the prime minister continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every single morning, they get up to a difficult life, which is not 
exclusively but (partially) our fault. We cannot deny that continuing to rule 
over a people foreign to us, who do not want us, has inflicted a painful price 
-- the price of never-ending conflict between us."

ACTIVISTS CHEER U.S. DECISION TO ANNUL ALASKA TIMBER DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A last vestige of America's campaign to rebuild and industrialize Japan after 
World War II has come to an abrupt end -- by order of the U.S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists cheered the decision as long overdue and just in time to 
preserve sound stewardship of the largest public forest in the U.S. inventory, 
the 17-million-acre Tongass National Forest in southeast Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tongass is the centerpiece of what environmentalists call the last intact 
temperate rain forest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Forest Service canceled the remaining 17 years on a 55-year, 
exclusive Tongass lumber contract that was one of the most unusual in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract was signed with Japanese investors 37 years ago, guaranteeing 
their company, Alaska Pulp Corp., wood from the Tongass forest through the year 
2011. The idea stemmed from Gen. Douglas MacArthur's program to help Japan 
after the war, and coincided with a desire in the U.S. Congress to create a 
year-round economy in the southern coastal region of Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 As a condition of the contract, Alaska Pulp promised to build and maintain a 
wood pulp mill in Alaska. In return, it received up to 100 million board feet 
of timber each year without competitive bidding. So far, the company has cut 
2.16 billion board feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists long have complained that an exclusive contract for such 
vast amounts of timber, including rare and valued Sitka Spruce, no longer 
served America's interests. They said it led to vast over-cutting and shorted 
U.S. taxpayers, who found themselves subsidizing the logging -- at least during 
some years. 
</P>
<P>
 Then last September, Alaska Pulp shut its pulp mill and laid off many of the 
400 employees, although it continued to use contract timber for its sawmill. 
The sawmill trims high-grade logs for shipment to Japan and the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said that increasing costs of pollution controls and a shrinking 
market made its pulp mill unprofitable. Alaska Pulp said it wanted to replace 
the operation with a modern plant to produce construction-grade fiberboard, all 
the while continuing to send trimmed logs from its sawmill to Asia. The 
fiberboard plant was to have employed 140 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Prompted by environmentalists, the Forest Service ruled that the company was 
in breach of the contract and nullified it. The Clinton Administration said 
Alaska Pulp now would have to bid competitively for the timber. 
</P>
<P>
 Alaska Pulp said it was "profoundly disappointed" and blamed the U.S. 
government for incrementally, year after year, changing the way the contract 
was administered, driving up costs until the pulp mill could not be sustained. 
Last year, the firm sued, complaining of government infringement on its 
contract rights. The case is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 John Hough, a director of the company, said its executives would meet this 
week to decide their next step. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the position of the company that its operations were on a 100-year, 
sustainable harvest plan, and environmentalists who say differently are wrong," 
Hough said. Alaska environmentalists believe the forest has been cut at twice 
the rate that is sustainable. And they said the contract cancellation means 
Tongass managers can better balance the conflicting needs of wildlife and fish 
habitat and timber harvesters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not saying you shouldn't cut trees on the Tongass. But you sure better 
cut them at a rate that everything else can live with," said Allen E. Smith, 
chairman of the Alaska Rainforest Coalition and regional director of the 
Wilderness Society. He said the contract represented "the worst of the last 
century's approach to logging." 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists now have their sights on the only remaining contract of this 
kind -- a 50-year deal signed in 1954 with the U.S.-owned Ketchikan Pulp Corp., 
also in the Tongass National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Jorgensen, attorney for the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, said the 
Administration should evoke "severe environmental damage" as grounds for 
canceling the remaining years on Ketchikan's contract. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alaska's congressional delegation and state government support the 
contracts. And even opponents agreed there was no clear-cut contract breach 
that would give the Administration easy justification to act.

KEY FRESNO CONGRESSMAN GETS SNUBBED, NOT WOOED; THE VOTE OF REP. LEHMAN, A 
DEMOCRAT IN A GOP DISTRICT, COULD BE CRUCIAL FOR CLINTON HEALTH CARE REFORM. 
BUT HE'S BEING IGNORED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To put it mildly, the Clinton Administration has not been particularly 
solicitous of Rep. Richard H. Lehman, the Fresno area Democrat who is 
struggling to hold his congressional seat in a largely Republican district. 
</P>
<P>
 When he asked for a Job Corps center, for instance, the Labor Department 
instead gave the facility to the San Francisco Bay Area -- which already had 
two others. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt came to the district for a tour of 
Yosemite Park without even bothering to contact the local congressman. That was 
his second snub: Last year, Babbitt invited Lehman -- one of Congress' most 
avid outdoorsmen -- on a camping trip, only to withdraw the invitation at the 
last minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy last year canceled an appearance in 
the Fresno Valley, which has been in the grip of a drought off and on for seven 
years. Espy has yet to make a stop in the district, the heart of the world's 
richest Farm Belt. 
</P>
<P>
 Such slights might not hold any particular significance, if it weren't for the 
fact that the North Fork lawmaker holds enormous leverage on the issue that is 
the heart of President Clinton's agenda: health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 He is one of three undecided Democrats who have become the focus of intense 
negotiations on the Energy and Commerce Committee, which is considered the most 
crucial battleground in the House. And without all three of their votes, 
Chairman John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) probably cannot produce a sweeping health 
care bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The position of Lehman and the other two Democrats -- Reps. Jim Slattery of 
Kansas and Rick Boucher of Virginia -- also demonstrates how closely fought the 
struggle over health care reform will be. Against a public mood that is 
increasingly suspicious of the Clinton plan and its various alternatives, House 
leaders have no choice but to build support the hard way: vote by vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The question for some, however, is whether the White House understands that. 
Aware of how badly he needs Lehman, Dingell has privately urged officials to 
start paying more attention to the lawmaker's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Or at least to cease what appears to be a none-too-subtle campaign of 
retribution against Lehman for his past votes against the Clinton economic 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lehman's not obstructionist. He wants to help if he can, which is all the 
more reason the White House ought to be smart about this," said one Democrat 
who has been close to the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of Energy and Commerce's health 
subcommittee, said: "They haven't been as attentive to him as they should be. I 
hope that changes. He is one of the most highly regarded members of the 
delegation." 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman insisted that past insults and injuries will have no bearing on his 
ultimate decision on how to vote, which he hopes to make this week. But he 
noted pointedly: "If they're going to need you down the line, they ought to pay 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
 His main concern, he said, is whether the farms and small businesses that make 
up about 90% of the employers in his district could afford Clinton's proposal 
that they pay for their workers' health coverage. Dingell has a variation 
exempting the smallest businesses, but that troubles Lehman as well. 
</P>
<P>
 With the right incentives, he said, employers might be able to expand coverage 
without being ordered to by Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be more comfortable giving market forces a better opportunity to work 
to get broader coverage before we resort to a mandate," he said. "If that 
doesn't work, we could phase it in." 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman also is demanding that the committee consider the effect that the 
Clinton plan and the Dingell alternative could have on the California Public 
Employees Retirement System, which provides health coverage to 930,000 
government employees and retirees. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton has hailed CALPERS' impressive efforts at holding down health 
premiums as a model for the nation, his plan would put it out of business. 
CALPERS officials say the Dingell proposal is not much better, because it would 
put a $142-million tax on the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Both plans, they say, would encourage the shift of health costs from corporate 
America to state governments. To date, CALPERS lobbyist David Vienna said, 
Lehman has been the only lawmaker to take those concerns seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman's situation is further complicated by his district, which is newly 
redrawn in a fashion inhospitable to any Democrat. In 1992, he won by only 
1,030 votes, which was less than a half-percent of the total cast. Clinton ran 
well behind former President George Bush, attracting only 38% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman's office is being swamped with telephone calls from constituents and 
interest groups opposing the Clinton plan, but the forces in favor of it are 
turning up the heat as well. Last week, 17 organizations, led by Consumers 
Union, began running newspaper ads in his district declaring: "Congressman 
Lehman: We Just Want the Same Health Care Coverage You Have." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're wasting their money," Lehman said, with a note of annoyance. "I'm 
going to make my decision on what's in the bill, not what's in the paid media."

WATANABE'S BID TO LEAD JAPAN FIZZLES; POLITICS: FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS 
PROPOSED CANDIDACY 'HAS BECOME DIFFICULT.' MEANWHILE, RULING COALITION PAVES 
WAY FOR CHOICE OF FOREIGN MINISTER TSUTOMU HATA. 
</P>

<P>
 A bid by opposition Liberal Democratic bigwig Michio Watanabe to succeed 
outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa fizzled Monday, while Japan's 
eight-party coalition narrowed its differences on policies to be implemented by 
a new prime minister from its own ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting this morning, deputies of the coalition parties agreed to commit 
themselves to a pledge to "obey" any U.N. sanctions that may be ordered against 
North Korea for its refusal to permit international inspections of its nuclear 
facilities. Any action Japan would take, moreover, would be carried out within 
the limits of its war-renouncing constitution, they agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ichiro Ozawa, deputy leader of Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata's Renewal Party 
and chief coalition strategist, initially proposed a revision of the Self 
Defense Forces law to permit Japan's military to provide fuel and supplies to 
U.S. forces in case of a U.N.-ordered blockade of North Korea. But Wataru Kubo, 
the Socialists' secretary general, opposed any military cooperation with the 
United States or South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies agreed to meet again later today in an attempt to settle the 
final dispute over whether to raise a 3% consumption tax to finance three years 
of income tax cuts. Socialists, who opposed implementaion of the consumption 
tax in 1989, reject any increase in its rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Without an increase in indirect taxes, the Finance Ministry has declared it 
will not approve income tax cuts continuing beyond this year; the cuts, many 
here hope, would restore economic growth and pull in imports, as the Clinton 
Administration has been urging. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the deputies complete a new coalition platform, coalition party chiefs 
are expected to approve it quickly and immediately make their choice for a new 
prime minister. Although no official proposal for the next leader has yet been 
made, the policy talks proceeded on the premise that Hata will be given the 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 If agreement is reached this afternoon, Hata is expected to be elected prime 
minister Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Watanabe, 70, a former foreign minister, reneged on his Sunday 
declaration that he would leave the Liberal Democratic Party, establish a new 
party and seek the coalition's backing as prime minister Monday. "I want to 
watch developments a little more," he told reporters outside his office in the 
evening after support for him failed to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
 Admitting that running as the coalition's candidate for prime minister "has 
become difficult," Watanabe said he will make his final decision today. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, six more Liberal Democrats bolted the party that had run the 
government for 38 years until last summer, bringing to 11 the number of 
defectors since Hosokawa announced that he would resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Watanabe, however, was not among them. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he had made his intention clear a little earlier, Watanabe could have 
gained more supporters," Hata said.

MITCHELL SERVES NOTICE OF INTENT TO PUSH HEALTH REFORM; POLITICS: MAJORITY 
LEADER USES WEEKEND RETREAT TO SPELL OUT FOR DEMOCRATS HIS SUPPORT FOR 
UNIVERSAL MEDICAL COVERAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN TUMULTY and EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), having forestalled a chance 
at a seat on the Supreme Court to concentrate on health care reform, has put 
his Democratic colleagues on notice that it is time to confront the difficult 
trade-offs that lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Painful as the choices may be, especially in a congressional election year, 
Mitchell has made it clear that he intends to hold Democrats accountable and do 
his best to force action on comprehensive universal health care before the year 
is out. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell signaled that the debate on health reform is entering this critical 
phase when he used the Democrats' annual retreat last weekend to spell out an 
unusually detailed set of options aimed at paring the costs of the plan without 
sacrificing President Clinton's goal of universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 For some senators, the meeting at Williamsburg, Va., marked the first time 
they really faced the specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 "In laying out the options, he really brought us to a better focus about what 
it is we have to decide and how we might reach consensus," said Sen. Tom 
Daschle (D-S.D.), who has been one of the Senate's leading backers of the 
President's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Daschle cautioned that three sets of alternatives being offered by Mitchell 
were primarily "for educational value" and were offered "without any 
expectation that we would adopt any of the options." 
</P>
<P>
 However, all were aimed at lowering the cost of Clinton's proposal without 
sacrificing his goal of universal coverage -- a tack similar to that being 
pursued in the House, where Energy and Commerce Chairman John D. Dingell 
(D-Mich.) is trying to round up enough support on his panel to pass sweeping 
health legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers' concerns over the cost of the Clinton plan heightened earlier this 
year, when the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the President's 
proposal would add $74 billion to the federal deficit by the end of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 All three options outlined by Mitchell also include the most controversial 
proposal in Clinton's plan: that all employers be required to pay some share of 
their workers' health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 One would pare that mandate from the minimum 80% employer contribution 
proposed by Clinton to 50%. It also would scale back benefits by 5% in overall 
value and allow firms with 1,000 or more workers to opt out of 
government-organized purchasing cooperatives. Under the President's plan, far 
more firms -- those with less than 5,000 workers -- would be required to join 
the so-called "alliances." 
</P>
<P>
 Another option would distribute government subsidies not to the small 
businesses with low-wage earners but to all low-wage workers, including those 
employed by big companies. Analysts said this alternative would be a more 
efficient and equitable way to provide assistance in buying insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said Mitchell's weekend presentation was intended to 
provide Senate Democrats -- especially on the Finance Committee -- with "a 
sense of the options" and specifically to "accelerate their progress" toward 
drafting a bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, a longtime advocate of health reform, acted independently of the 
White House, but Administration analysts "fell over themselves" whenever he or 
his staff sought information or technical advice, Administration sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Mitchell was saying, in effect, was: 'Focus, you guys. Time's up. Think. 
Here we go!' " explained one Administration official. "In terms of what 
Mitchell was presenting, he used the core of the President's plan, and from 
that he did some tweaking." 
</P>
<P>
 To the extent that Mitchell's action may expedite progress in the Senate, it 
also may persuade House members to proceed apace with their own health reform 
efforts. House members have been wary of getting too far out in front of the 
Senate on health care because they have not forgotten last year's bruising 
budget battle in which they voted for an unpopular energy tax only to have the 
Senate kill it later. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who sharply criticized Mitchell's options was Rep. Jim McDermott 
(D-Wash.), the chief sponsor of the Canadian-style single-payer plan, in which 
the government pays most medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
 McDermott said he would not vote for a proposal that reduces the ratio of 
employer-employee contributions from 80%-20% to 50%-50%. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way I'll go back (to Washington state) and tell the aerospace 
mechanics that they are going to have to pay for half their health care," he 
said. "This plan was clearly put out by someone who's not going to run again." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Monday, senior White House officials expressed optimism that 
comprehensive health care reform will be enacted this year -- in part, one 
said, because the Whitewater controversy appears to be receding as an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But another senior Clinton adviser conceded that the President still must 
overcome a public perception that his plan means "big government is taking over 
the health care system." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our job," he added, is to ensure that Congress does not merely enact "a small 
package of insurance reforms" that do not provide universal coverage or control 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The President, meanwhile, continued a series of recent health care appearances 
with a speech in Milwaukee that stressed what his plan would do for small 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing about 1,000 employees of the Ameritech telecommunications company 
at Milwaukee's Italian Community Center, Clinton said his proposals would cap 
the percentage of payroll that any business must pay for health benefits and 
would provide subsidies for small firms with low-wage earners. Under Clinton's 
plan, no firm would have to pay more than 7.9% of payroll, while small firms 
with low-wage workers may pay as little as 3.5% of payroll.

JAPANESE STUDENT SHOT IN CARJACKING TO STAY IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Japanese college student shot during a carjacking says he still loves 
America, even though he thinks that it's a dangerous place to visit and should 
have stricter gun control laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Kouichi Takemoto, who is studying travel and tourism at National College in 
Denver, told reporters Monday he plans to remain in the United States and 
complete his studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like America. I love America," Takemoto said at Denver General Hospital. 
But he warned: "If you want to come to the United States, you must always be 
careful." 
</P>
<P>
 Takemoto, 26, was returning to his apartment in southeast Denver early Friday 
when he was accosted by two men in the parking lot. He was shot just below the 
left shoulder, and $30 and his 1987 Toyota were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 The car was recovered about five miles away; police have not made any arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors said the bullet grazed an artery and damaged three nerves that 
regulate motor control in the left forearm and hand. One nerve is expected to 
heal, but it will be at least three weeks before doctors know the extent of 
damage to the other two nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack came less than a month after two 19-year-old Japanese students were 
shot and killed in a carjacking in Los Angeles. Two people have been charged in 
that incident, which prompted an apology from President Clinton to the Japanese 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The California carjacking revived fears in Japan about U.S. violence that had 
flared in 1992 when a Japanese high school student looking for a Halloween 
party was fatally shot by a Louisiana homeowner who mistook him for a prowler.

MAN SETTLES ABUSE SUIT AGAINST PRIEST AND CINCINNATI ARCHDIOCESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who accused a Roman Catholic cardinal of molesting him, then abruptly 
dropped the allegation, settled his sex-abuse lawsuit against the church and 
another priest, lawyers for both sides said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cincinnati Archdiocese and the priest named in the lawsuit did not admit 
any wrongdoing, the lawyers said, and the amount of the settlement paid to 
Steven J. Cook was not revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook filed the $10-million suit Nov. 12, claiming that Cardinal Joseph 
Bernardin and Father Ellis Harsham had sexually abused him between 1975 and 
1977 when he was a high school student attending a program at a Cincinnati 
seminary. 
</P>
<P>
 He dropped Bernardin as a defendant on Feb. 28, saying he could not be sure if 
memories of Bernardin molesting him, which were brought out by hypnosis, were 
accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook's lawyer, Andrew Lipton, said his client was settling the lawsuit because 
he has AIDS and did not want to face a lengthy court case. The lawsuit had been 
scheduled for trial May 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stress of litigation has a bearing on his health," Lipton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk said the settlement enabled the 
archdiocese to save legal costs of $100,000 or more, but at the expense of an 
opportunity to clear the defendants before a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook, 34, stands by his allegations that Harsham abused him, Lipton said. The 
Cincinnati Archdiocese was accused of failing to protect Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 Harsham, 52, was an instructor at the St. Gregory Seminary in the 1970s, when 
Bernardin was archbishop of Cincinnati. Both men vigorously denied the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Harsham said he was confident that he could have proved his innocence in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 Harsham, who works in the campus ministry at Wright State University, has not 
been removed from his duties.

CLINTON GETS A LEG UP ON JOGGING JOKE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ameritech Wisconsin President Bronson Haase gave President Clinton a running 
suit Monday emblazoned with the name of the company -- and added some fashion 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding the gift, Clinton laughed and told an audience of Ameritech employees, 
"I want to tell you what your fearless leader had just said to me, in a way 
that you couldn't hear over the microphone.He said, 'I want you to have this 
jogging suit because I keep seeing you running in running shorts and I think it 
would be better if you had long pants.' ' 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, whose chunky, white legs are often fodder for comedians, poked fun at 
himself. "Hey, you know it's part of my job to make people feel better, and 
I've made millions of Americans feel better about how they look in running 
clothes," he said to laughter.

RETURNING GEESE'S FLIGHT PLAN MAKES THEIR MOTHER PROUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Getting to Virginia was easy for the 18 geese that Canadian artist and pilot 
William Lishman raised from birth. All they had to do was follow their mother, 
the airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether any of the geese would make it back to their Canadian summer home was 
what had Lishman fretting for days, until 10 of them suddenly appeared outside 
his door Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They look in great shape," Lishman said by phone from his Toronto-area home. 
"I took them all kinds of goodies to eat, but they'd rather root in the pond." 
</P>
<P>
 Lishman hoped to "imprint" the birds at birth to believe that an ultra-light 
aircraft was their parent, so they would follow the plane south for their 
winter migration. Geese, cranes and swans learn their migration routes from 
their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 If the experiment worked with geese, Lishman and scientist William Sladen of 
the Airlie Conference Center reasoned, the same technique could be used to 
restore such rare species as whooping cranes and trumpeter swans to territories 
they once occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the birds died in accidents over the winter. When the remaining 16 left 
the Airlie Conference Center near Warrenton on April 2 and weren't seen for 
nearly two weeks, Lishman worried. 
</P>
<P>
 It now appears the birds were just taking their time, and Lishman said the 
remaining six should show up eventually. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even getting 10 back is fine. It's better odds than happens in normal 
nature," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Lishman is incubating another batch of goose eggs. He hopes 
to introduce the hatchlings to their mother, the plane, in the fall. The first 
group's next challenge also will come in the fall, when Lishman and Sladen hope 
they will return to Virginia, this time without their mother's help.

PUBLIC WORKERS' STRIKE IN HAWAII CURBS SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tax refunds and unemployment claims were delayed and libraries were closed 
Monday when more than 13,000 state and county workers went on strike for the 
first time in the 60-year history of the Hawaii Government Employees Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The union is seeking a minimum 8% pay raise over two years, twice what the 
state and counties have offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from both sides ended negotiations early Monday, and picket 
lines went up around the state. The negotiators remained on call, however, said 
Russell Okata, executive director of the government employees union. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have told the membership the success of the strike depends on solidarity, 
but they should be prepared for a long strike," Okata said as he joined the 
picket line outside the Honolulu Municipal Building. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. John Waihee said he regretted the walkout. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are rarely winners in any strike," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike affected everything from health clinics to municipal golf courses 
to the issuance of licenses and permits. 
</P>
<P>
 State offices where people normally have until April 20 to drop off tax 
returns were closed, and officials said taxpayers would have to use the mail, 
which could take them longer to receive refunds. 
</P>
<P>
 Public schools remained open and police and firefighters were not striking, as 
unions representing teachers, firefighters and police officers accepted the 4% 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 But 6,700 other workers, many of them in non-teaching positions at the 
University of Hawaii, were expected to join the strike Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's tourism industry was not expected to be affected, officials said, 
because all employees vital to airport operations were declared essential and 
forbidden to strike. People flying to the Mainland were advised to get to the 
airport up to two hours early, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Others deemed essential were police dispatchers, lifeguards, security guards, 
school health aides and hospital X-ray technicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Golfer Henry Ally, who usually plays at the Ala Wai course Wednesdays and 
Fridays, took the disruption in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope I can play on Wednesday, but I'm skeptical," he said.

TIERED WATER RATES RULED OK; CONSERVATION: APPEALS COURT SUPPORTS POLICY OF 
CHARGING HIGHER FEES TO HEAVY USERS DURING A DROUGHT. DECISION IS VICTORY FOR 
BAY AREA UTILITY DISTRICT. 
</P>

<P>
 A water district can charge higher rates for heavy residential water use to 
encourage conservation during a drought, a state appeals court ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1st District Court of Appeal said the East Bay Municipal Utility 
District's former rates, which were nearly four times as high for high volumes 
of water as for low volumes, were not an illegal tax or an excessive fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Most large water districts in the state have used a similar rate structure 
during recent droughts, said Verna Bromley, a lawyer for the East Bay district. 
She said a state law passed last year authorizes differential water prices to 
promote conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for residents who challenged the rates could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The East Bay district, which serves more than 1.1 million residents of Alameda 
and Contra Costa counties, adopted the four-tier rate structure in May, 1991, 
and increased the differential the next month. After five straight dry years, 
the district said its goal was to cut water use 15% without raising overall 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Families in the lowest tier, using up to 250 gallons a day, were charged $1.05 
for 748 gallons. Those in the highest tier, over 1,200 gallons a day, were 
charged $3.94 for the same amount. The district's board said the top tier 
consisted of 3.5% of the families who used 17% of the water that went to 
residential customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest tiers were eliminated in April, 1993, after a wet winter, leaving 
only a modest difference in rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was filed by a group of customers who said the rates discriminated 
against residents of hotter areas, east of the Berkeley-Oakland hills, and 
amounted to a tax increase without voter approval, in violation of Proposition 
13. Bromley said the customers did not request a refund but sought to prohibit 
differential rates in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Upholding a decision by Contra Costa County Superior Court Judge David Dolgin, 
the appeals court ruled 3-0 that the rates were a legal conservation measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The district had evidence that "the profligate usage of water" by individuals 
was a major reason that mandatory conservation was needed, said the opinion by 
Richard Hodge, an Alameda County Superior Court judge assigned to the appeals 
court for the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Because additional water supplies would cost more, Hodge said, a rate 
structure tied to water use was a fee related to the district's cost of 
service, not a tax.

WOMAN BITTEN BY SHARK HAD WON LEUKEMIA BATTLE 
</P>

<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman authorities believe was killed by a great white shark had recently won 
a battle against leukemia, friends say. 
</P>
<P>
 The body found floating off a popular surfing spot Friday was identified as 
Michelle Von Emster, 25, of San Diego, the medical examiner's office said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened is really a shame because she had a lot of tough going in her 
life," said Denise Knox, owner of the office supply store where Von Emster 
worked as a clerk. "What she told us was that she had been in remission the 
past two years from leukemia and that she had undergone really horrendous 
treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 The body was found Friday, 200 yards off a beach at Point Loma. Marine 
biologists said the woman had been attacked by a 12-foot great white shark. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring new evidence, Von Emster's death would be the first confirmed shark 
bite fatality along the Pacific Coast of the United States since 1989.

HIGH COURT TO RULE ON LAW BARRING GUNS NEAR SCHOOLS; GOVERNMENT: CONGRESS' 
POWER TO TRANSFORM LOCAL CRIMES INTO FEDERAL OFFENSES IS AT STAKE. INTERSTATE 
COMMERCE AUTHORITY IS CITED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Supreme Court said Monday it will decide whether the federal government 
can make it a crime to carry a gun within 1,000 feet of a school, a ruling that 
could put a major crimp in Congress' power. 
</P>
<P>
 The case of a San Antonio teen-ager who took a handgun to school raises a 
potentially far-reaching issue of federal authority to combat crime. Congress 
is often assumed to have the power to get involved in any national problem, 
including crime, on the theory that it is related to interstate commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 But last year, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the Gun-Free 
School Zones Act of 1990 on the grounds that Congress did not have the 
constitutional authority to regulate the "mere possession of a firearm" at 
school. Under the Constitution, Congress can "regulate commerce . . . among the 
several states," but carrying a gun to school does not involve interstate 
commerce, the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
 This decision, if allowed to stand, would scrap the 1990 gun law and sap 
Congress' power in the war on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the New Deal era of the 1930s, the high court has allowed Congress to 
regulate virtually every aspect of American life because it is said to be 
affected by interstate commerce. For example, the landmark Civil Rights Act of 
1964 was upheld as constitutional on the grounds that racial discrimination in 
the workplace and at hotels and restaurants affects interstate commerce. The 
justices said that because patrons at hotels and restaurants may travel across 
state lines, federal anti-discrimination laws are constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, some conservative legal scholars and judges have continued to 
dispute whether Congress indeed has the constitutional power to regulate 
matters that are inherently local. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist has 
joined in questioning the wisdom, if not the constitutionality, of making state 
and local crimes into federal offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-crime bill on Capitol Hill includes provisions such as "three strikes 
and you're out" and the Violence Against Women Act, which would transform state 
offenses into federal crimes. These days, members of Congress often say that if 
it is a national problem, they have the authority to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the guns-in-school case, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court, based in New 
Orleans, looked back to the original Constitution and its more constricted view 
of Congress' authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. Constitution establishes a national government of limited and 
enumerated powers," wrote Judge Will Garwood of Austin, Tex. To regulate a new 
area, Congress must show a clear link to interstate commerce, he said. For 
example, Congress can certainly regulate the transportation and distribution of 
guns or illegal drugs because those products move in interstate commerce, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Congress can outlaw "the mere possession by any person of any firearm . 
. . within 1,000 feet of the grounds of any school . . . then it could 
similarly ban lead pencils, sneakers, Gameboys or slide rules," said the 
appellate judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling came in the case of Alfonso Lopez Jr., a high school senior from 
San Antonio, who came to school in 1992 carrying a .38-caliber handgun. He was 
arrested and convicted of violating the federal law and sentenced to six months 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But the U.S. appeals court voided his conviction and halted the use of the 
federal guns-in-school act in Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana. Lopez's 
attorney noted that all three states have their own laws making it a crime to 
have a gun on school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Herb Kohl (D-Wis.), sponsor of the no-guns law, said the "lower court's 
decision threatens a whole host of federal firearms and other crime statutes." 
More than 200,000 students carry guns to school every day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In its appeal, the Clinton Administration said firearms "present a national 
problem" that requires federal legislation, and the justices said Monday that 
they will hear the case of U.S. vs. Lopez, 93-1260. Arguments will be held in 
the fall, with a ruling likely early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unrelated case, the court agreed to rule on whether Congress can ban all 
federal employees from receiving money for writing articles or giving speeches 
during their free time. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban was included in the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 and was intended to stop 
the practice of federal employees taking payments from groups that had business 
with Congress or a federal agency. These honorariums created at least the 
"appearance of conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
 But last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals here struck down part of the law as a 
free-speech violation. It cited as examples a Navy technician who wrote 
articles about Civil War ironclad vessels and a Labor Department lawyer who 
lectured on Judaism and a Housing Department employee who free-lanced as a 
theater critic. 
</P>
<P>
 In their appeal, attorneys for the Administration asked the court to reinstate 
the law. The justices will hear arguments in U.S. vs. National Treasury 
Employees Union, 93-1170, during the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, the court agreed to rule on whether a defendant's statements 
during the discussion of a plea bargain can later be used against him. The case 
involves a San Diego-area man who was convicted of drug dealing after 
plea-bargain talks failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Statements the defendant made during the talks were later cited by federal 
prosecutors. A U.S. appeals court ruled that such statements cannot be used 
against a defendant and overturned the conviction. But the high court agreed to 
hear the government's appeal in U.S. vs. Mezzanatto, 93-1340.

PROBE URGED OF ALLEGED INCOME TAX FRAUD; IRS: KEY CONGRESSMEN CHARGE THAT 
ABUSES MAY COST THE GOVERNMENT UP TO $9 BILLION A YEAR. REFUNDS UNDER EARNED 
INCOME PROVISION ARE TARGETED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Angry leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee, charging that rapidly 
growing income tax refund fraud could cost the government as much as $9 billion 
annually, are demanding that the Clinton Administration investigate the 
Internal Revenue Service's flawed detection system. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief source of the fraud, the legislators said, is abuse of the earned 
income tax credit, which was designed in 1975 to supplement the wages of 
millions of low-income workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall refund fraud -- "detected and undetected, paper and electronic" -- is 
far greater than the several millions of dollars officially estimated by the 
IRS in February, the lawmakers of the tax-writing committee said in a letter to 
top Administration officials. A copy of the letter was obtained Monday by The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 In a severe rebuke to the IRS, the committee leaders asked Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen and Budget Director Leon E. Panetta to create an independent 
government task force to investigate the magnitude of the refund fraud and to 
develop tighter controls for the 1995 and 1996 filing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter was signed by Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.); 
Bill Archer of Texas, the committee's ranking Republican; J. J. Pickle 
(D-Tex.), chairman of the oversight subcommittee; and Amo Houghton of New York, 
the subcommittee's ranking Republican member. 
</P>
<P>
 Abuse of the earned income tax credit is likely to be especially onerous to 
the Clinton Administration, which considers it one of the most effective 
anti-poverty programs in the nation -- when used properly. The tax bill passed 
by Congress last year will expand the credit substantially. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most other kinds of tax abuses, which typically are committed by 
individuals who lie about deductions or income to reduce their tax liability, 
the refund fraud involves taxpayers working in concert with criminals and 
agreeing to divide the ill-gotten gains, Archer said in an interview Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have massive programs of dollars, inevitably enterprising criminals 
will take advantage of them," Archer said. "Criminals can enlist thousands of 
other people to pick up easy money." 
</P>
<P>
 Fraud cases from the earned income tax credit average $1,800 each, Archer 
said. Overall, the magnitude of all refund fraud "could approach $8 billion or 
$9 billion very easily," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although abuse of the earned income tax credit accounts for the largest 
portion of the tax refund fraud, other forms include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Unscrupulous tax return preparers who submit claims for fraudulent refunds 
using the names and Social Security numbers of unsuspecting workers who had not 
filed returns. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prisoners who use other prisoners' Social Security numbers, names and false 
W-2 forms to file fraudulent claims for refunds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Preparers who mismatch names and Social Security numbers and submit joint 
returns on behalf of people who are not married and may not even know each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury Department, which oversees the IRS, acknowledged Monday that 
fraudulent refund claims are a serious and rapidly growing problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Logue-Kinder, Treasury's assistant secretary-designate for public 
affairs, said that the department "is taking this very seriously and is 
examining exactly what kinds of options we want to pursue to correct this 
difficulty." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that the problem is "not something we can wave a magic wand over and 
cure overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 A congressional hearing in February indicated widespread problems with fraud 
in electronic filing of tax returns. Because refunds are processed quickly, 
compared with ordinary returns filed on paper, there is less time for the IRS 
to check whether fraud has been committed. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the letter from Congress chastising the IRS went beyond the issue of 
electronic filing and called the refund fraud an "epidemic." 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the letter charged, the losses are "invisible" to the IRS, whose 
"fraud prevention and detection systems are seriously flawed." 
</P>
<P>
 The earned income tax credit is an easy target for fraud because it is used by 
people with very low earnings who often do not have regular jobs, such as 
self-employed neighborhood hairdressers or repairmen. They are not subject to 
regular income tax withholding requirements and do not receive the W-2 forms so 
familiar to full-time employees of most businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The credit is applied against taxes owed or withheld and typically will 
produce a refund. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic credit for a family with two children earning between $7,750 and 
$12,200 is $1,511. Taxpayers earning less than $23,050 are likely to qualify 
for some credit. 
</P>
<P>
 The abuse can occur in several forms. 
</P>
<P>
 In one scenario, a taxpayer without children would use the taxpayer 
identification numbers from someone else's under-age children. The taxpayer, 
aided by a scam artist, would list the children as dependents and claim to have 
earnings low enough to qualify for the maximum benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 If the return is filed electronically, the refund would arrive within three 
weeks, and the taxpayer and the partner would split it. 
</P>
<P>
 The taxpayer also might falsely claim that he or she spent money to buy health 
insurance -- which could result in a credit of as much as $465. As with many 
legitimate deductions, no documentation is required. 
</P>
<P>
 The earned income tax credit is claimed on about 14 million returns a year. 
The government estimates that taxpayers will legitimately qualify for $20 
billion in earned income credits this year alone.

 A portrait of Nazi leader Heinrich Himmler that provoked a free-speech 
controversy at tiny Midland Lutheran College will continue to hang in the 
college library, the school's president said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A faculty committee agreed with a student group that the life-size painting, 
which has hung in the library for 10 years, should be accompanied by an 
"appropriate contextual statement and interpretation." 
</P>
<P>
 The painting became the subject of controversy when a student complained. The 
artist, former art professor David Amland, has said the work is not meant to 
glorify Nazism.

WOMAN STRUCK BY POLICE BATON ASKS $1.5 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles city jail supervisor's lawyer Monday asked a jury to award the 
woman $1.5 million in damages for a confrontation outside police headquarters 
in which an officer hit her with a baton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who initiated this confrontation? Who refused to accept a reasonable 
explanation of who she was? Who initiated physical contact?" attorney Charles 
Mazursky said in his closing argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazursky represents Jennifer Jones, 43, who was stopped by two Los Angeles 
police officers as she was going to work at Parker Center on Aug. 9, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers Michael Daly and John Puis, who were bringing a suspect into the jail 
for booking, saw Jones rushing across the parking lot without a purse and 
became suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly challenged her and the confrontation escalated, ending with Jones 
handcuffed after Puis delivered a single baton blow to her legs. Daly suffered 
a scratch on his forehead by Jones' key ring. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue in the case is whether the officers acted reasonably and, if the jury 
finds they did not, how much Jones should receive in damages.

SOFTWARE FIRM LOSES TOP EXECS AMID SCANDAL OVER REVENUE; COMPUTERS: PLATINUM 
ADMITS THAT IT HAS OVERSTATED FIGURES FOR THE PAST 15 MONTHS. ITS STOCK DROPS 
64%. 
</P>

<P>
 Irvine-based Platinum Software Corp. was plunged into turmoil Monday after 
four top executives quit and the company said it has overstated revenue for the 
past 15 months. The news sent the company's stock plummeting by 64% in furious 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum, a fast-growing maker of custom accounting software for large and 
medium-sized companies, also said it will lay off an unspecified number of its 
820 employees, restate revenue for the past four quarters and report a 
"substantial" loss for its third quarter, ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to be a massive accounting fraud," said Alan Schulman, a San Diego 
attorney representing some shareholders who are suing Platinum for alleged 
securities violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce C. Edwards, Platinum's chief financial officer, declined to comment 
except to say, "You would expect an attorney to say that." 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum announced the executive departures and other changes in a news 
release that said it discovered its accounting problems as a result of its own 
investigation stemming from the shareholder suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the departures was Platinum founder, Chairman and Chief Executive 
Gerald R. Blackie. His temporary replacement is Carmelo J. Santoro, a Platinum 
director and former chairman of AST Research Inc., a large Irvine-based 
personal computer maker. 
</P>
<P>
 Santoro said a number of transactions at Platinum appear to have been recorded 
as revenue for quarters before the deals were completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a strict interpretation, we were putting revenues in the wrong place," he 
said. "It's almost impossible to conceive that, with a restatement of this 
nature, the SEC will not get involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Securities and Exchange Commission were unavailable for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum announced its news before the stock market opened Monday. By the end 
of the day, Platinum shares had fallen $6.44 to close at $3.56. Nearly 4 
million shares changed hands, making the stock one of the most actively traded 
Nasdaq issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, this is a very large negative surprise," said Frank Michnoff, 
analyst at Prudential Securities Research in New York. "This restatement of 
revenue casts a shadow on the (company's) whole future." 
</P>
<P>
 Santoro and Edwards, who has been on the board since October, will now be the 
company's sole directors. Edwards, acting chief financial officer, is also 
chief financial officer for AST. But Santoro said Monday that he will move fast 
to form a new management team. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's announcement by Platinum's new management culminated an investigation 
that Santoro and Edwards began in January after the shareholder lawsuit pointed 
out irregularities in the timing of reporting some sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Shareholder Ezriel Tauber filed the suit Jan. 19, a day after the company 
announced cancellation of a major order and Platinum's stock fell 24%. In the 
suit, Tauber accused the company of withholding vital information from 
investors before the price tumbled.

 The parent of 7-Eleven Stores disclosed Monday that it is not terminating 
franchise agreements with four of eight store operators it had accused of price 
gouging after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Southland Corp. announced plans to cancel agreements with eight 
franchisees to send a signal that 7-Eleven "does not tolerate or condone" price 
gouging. The company's action came amid widespread complaints about gouging and 
was praised by lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Southland spokeswoman Margaret Chabris said Monday that the company 
has reached settlements with four of the franchisees, saying there was not 
enough evidence against some of them "to win in a court of law." The company is 
continuing its efforts to terminate agreements against the remaining four 
franchisees, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it gave five franchisees the opportunity to settle the 
violations, in part by paying 7-Eleven about $15,000 each. Four accepted the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth, Ming Ming Lu, did not accept the settlement and is facing 
termination, along with Meilin Hua, Simaan G. Mourad and a fourth franchisee 
whose name has not been disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Southland has filed a suit against Lu, Hua and Mourad to force them to turn 
over their franchises. The three are fighting the suit in court, saying they 
did not gouge customers.  
</P>
<P>
 In the days after the Northridge quake, complaints were rampant about price 
gouging at liquor stores, convenience stores and gas stations. Concerns about 
gouging led to swift passage of a county ordinance, modeled after a Los Angeles 
city ordinance, prohibiting price increases of more than 10% in times of 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three months since the quake, however, Los Angeles city investigators 
have been unable to substantiate most of the accusations. No price-gouging 
charges have been filed against any store owner, and Deputy City Atty. Greg 
Parham said only a fraction of the 1,600 complaints remain under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Parham said Monday that Lu, Hua and Mourad have been cleared of price-gouging 
charges for "insufficient evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 In investigating complaints against 7-Eleven Stores, the city also considered 
evidence supplied by Southland. The company installed a toll-free hot line for 
complaints and dispatched a team of undercover shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Parham said Southland's evidence mostly consisted of "violations of 
Southland's procedures, like not giving customers receipts." 
</P>
<P>
 Hua said in an interview that she rounded off prices at her store because she 
did not have change. For example, she said she charged $5 for a four-pack of 
Evian water that usually sells for $4.36. 
</P>
<P>
 Hua said she did not want to open her Reseda store on Jan. 17 -- she had no 
electricity and it was cluttered with broken glass and damaged merchandise -- 
but customers pleaded for water and other supplies. She said that since then, 
300 customers have signed a statement saying they thought she treated them 
fairly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to make the transaction easier, faster," Hua said. "This money cannot 
make me rich, it cannot make me happy. . . . Opening the store was a big 
mistake."

'ARSENIO HALL SHOW' GIVEN PINK SLIP AFTER LOW RATINGS; TELEVISION: SOME NETWORK 
AFFILIATES SWUNG AWAY FROM SYNDICATED PROGRAM WHEN DAVID LETTERMAN JOINED CBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "The Arsenio Hall Show," once defined as the new model for late-night 
television, will end production May 27, a victim of declining ratings and an 
overcrowded talk-show field. 
</P>
<P>
 The cancellation comes only weeks after the show's producer, Paramount 
Domestic Television Distribution, vowed that the show was not in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, the show had been dogged by rumors that the lower ratings 
were making it increasingly difficult for producers to book guests. In 
addition, Hall suffered a backlash for providing an unchallenged forum for 
controversial Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-year-old syndicated talk show made Hall a household name and brought him 
considerable renown -- including a 1989 Time magazine cover story that 
trumpeted Hall as "TV's hip host" who "grabs the post-Carson generation." It 
also brought Hall considerable fortune; in the show's peak year, he was said to 
earn more than $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But the highly competitive late-night talk-show environment of the last couple 
of years changed even faster than it took for Hall's show to become a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 When the show was first launched in 1989, Paramount purposefully went after 
several key CBS affiliates who were unhappy with their own network's poor 
record in late-night. Those affiliates gave "The Arsenio Hall Show" valuable 
placements in late-night time periods on local TV channels. 
</P>
<P>
 But after snatching David Letterman away from NBC last year, CBS won back many 
of its affiliates who were carrying "The Arsenio Hall Show." Partly as a 
result, the number of stations carrying the Hall show dropped to 160 from 184. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall had been in negotiations for a new contract. In a statement, he said 
those negotiations and his sentiments toward the show and its staff "made this 
the most complicated decision of my life . . . but everything must change, and 
it's time." 
</P>
<P>
 Although "The Arsenio Hall Show" continued to attract a young audience -- 
President Clinton played his saxophone on the show, one of the indelible images 
of the 1992 Presidential campaign -- and was still the place to watch 
up-and-coming stars frequently overlooked by David Letterman and Jay Leno, the 
show's ratings nonetheless slid 24% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount said Hall will develop film and TV projects at the studio, but it 
gave no indication of its long-term plans for replacing Hall. It said reruns of 
the show will air until September.

DOW FALLS 41 AFTER FED RATE HIKE; BOND YIELDS HIT 15-MONTH HIGH; MARKETS: 
CENTRAL BANK'S THIRD INCREASE THIS YEAR TRIGGERS WAVE OF SELLING BUT NO PANIC. 
BOND TRADERS FEAR FURTHER HIKES LIE AHEAD. 
</P>

<P>
 Bond yields surged and stock prices slumped Monday, as investors were caught 
off guard by another Federal Reserve Board move to tighten credit. 
</P>
<P>
 In the battered bond market, any hope that the selling trend of recent weeks 
had exhausted itself was dashed, and traders again dumped bonds and sent yields 
soaring. The jump in U.S. yields triggered a similar rise in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 41.05 points to 
3,620.42, its lowest close since it fell to 3,593.35 during the selling frenzy 
of April 4. Trading volume, however, was only moderate Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the Fed's decision to raise short-term rates by an estimated 
quarter-point, the third such increase this year, shocked investors because 
most believed the Fed was weeks away from such action. 
</P>
<P>
 "This move took everybody by surprise," said Robert Brusca, economist at Nikko 
Securities International in New York. Last week's economic statistics, he said, 
were tame enough to suggest that the Fed had some time to consider whether 
tighter credit was warranted to further brake the economy and inflationary 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts thought the Fed would weigh its options until at least May 17, 
when its policy-making Open Market Committee is to meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Streeters said the timing of Monday's move was particularly unnerving to 
the beleaguered bond market, because it could suggest that the Fed sees more 
pent-up inflation in the economy than has been recognized by consumers and 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fed is making rate moves that don't seem to relate to anything" known to 
the rest of the country, Brusca said. Increasingly unsure as to how high the 
Fed ultimately might push short-term interest rates, many bond traders and 
investors have been bailing out of bonds since early February -- an exodus that 
accelerated anew on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The selling was reflected in another across-the-board rise in bond yields. The 
yield on one-year Treasury bills, which was 3.83% after the Fed's first rate 
boost Feb. 4, leaped to 4.89% from 4.72% on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year Treasury bond yield jumped to 7.42% from 7.28% on Friday, to its 
highest level since President Clinton was inaugurated in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields on other types of bonds, including tax-exempt municipal issues and 
mortgage-backed issues, also rose sharply, in the kind of chain reaction that 
has become all too familiar to owners of bonds and bond funds this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's move also rekindled selling of long-term bonds in Europe. The yield 
on Britain's benchmark long-term bond rocketed to 7.90% from 7.68% on Friday. 
In Germany, 10-year government bonds yielded 6.47%, up from 6.36% on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the renewed rise in European yields threatened to aggravate the 
recession on the Continent. Indeed, the major problem for Europe, Asia and 
Latin America this year is that their long-term interest rates are following 
U.S. rates upward, though the economic fundamentals abroad don't dictate higher 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The continuing debacle in the bond market has partly been attributed to 
excessive 1993 speculation in bonds by Wall Street dealers, so-called hedge 
funds and other players who had wrongly bet that long-term yields would 
continue to drop this year. 
</P>
<P>
 By borrowing short-term in 1993 to buy long-term bonds, these players have 
suffered a double whammy: Each Fed hike in short-term rates increases the 
"carrying" cost of bonds, while each rise in long-term rates devalues existing 
bonds, leaving their owners with large losses on paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Forced liquidations on the part of many of these speculators have helped drive 
long-term yields higher than what otherwise might have occurred. And Monday's 
selling wave indicated that such liquidations have not yet run their course. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel there's still more to go" in terms of higher bond yields, warned Bob 
Auwaerter, a bond fund manager at the Vanguard Group in Valley Forge, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, meanwhile, the Dow sank 45 points after the Fed announced 
the rate hike Monday morning, and it held at lower levels until the close. 
Losers topped winners 16 to 6 on the New York Stock Exchange and by 16 to 10 on 
Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 But trading volume was relatively sluggish, typical for a Monday. And the 
damage to broader market indexes was mixed. Surprisingly, the Dow utility 
index, usually the most sensitive to higher interest rates, eased just 0.13 
point to 194.11. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Nie, technical analyst at Kemper Securities in Chicago, said the 
shrinking level of trading in recent weeks suggests the market is stabilizing 
and that it could hold to a narrow range for the next few months rather than 
break decisively lower. But, he said, that is assuming that long-term interest 
rates stop rising soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we pierce 7.5% (on the 30-year T-bond), that will spell more trouble" for 
stocks, Nie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Industrial stocks were weak Monday. Some health care and energy issues showed 
strength. Financial stocks were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Dow, Alcoa fell 1 3/8 to 66 3/8 and GE dropped 1 7/8 to 94 7/8. Merck, 
however, added 3/8 to 28 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Among energy stocks, Sonat gained 3/4 to 29 3/4, Ashland Oil rose 1 to 41 3/4 
and Atlantic Richfield edged up 3/8 to 99. May oil futures rose 7 cents to 
$16.65 a barrel on the New York Merc . 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 * Mexican stock prices plunged with Wall Street. The Bolsa index lost 61.02 
points to 2,137.62. 
</P>
<P>
 * In London, the FTSE-100 index sank 30.1 points to 3,138.2. Tokyo's Nikkei 
average inched up 112.73 points to 20,277.36. 
</P>
<P>
 * Near-term gold futures eased 90 cents to $376.80 an ounce on the Comex. 
</P>
<P>
 * ANOTHER FED INCREASE: The Fed raised the key federal funds rate. A1 
</P>
<P>
 * BLOW TO STATE RECOVERY?: The hike is seen as bad news for California firms. 
A1 Another Surge in Yields 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board's latest boost in short-term interest rates, 
announced Monday, sent short- and long-term market rates higher again. How key 
rates have risen since the Fed first tightened credit on Feb. 4: Monday: 
3-month Treasury security yields: 3.77 1-year Treasury security yields: 4.89 
10-year Treasury security yields: 7.15

TOWERING LOSSES; JAPAN'S U.S. REAL ESTATE BUYING BINGE IS NOW BUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Burned by recession and falling property values on both sides of the Pacific, 
Japanese investors are hoping to sell or lower the debt on as much as 40% of 
the U.S. office towers and other real estate they have bought over the last 
nine years, a survey by a respected accounting and consulting firm shows. 
</P>
<P>
 In a dramatic sign that big foreign buyers no longer see owning U.S. 
properties as a sure-fire way to make money, the report by Los Angeles-based 
Kenneth Leventhal & Co. said that Japanese investors put only $705 million into 
American real estate last year -- a mere 4% of the $16.54 billion they invested 
at the peak of their buying binge in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of that money went to finish projects they had begun years ago, 
primarily hotel ventures in Hawaii, said Leventhal's Jack Rodman, who directed 
the annual survey. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since Leventhal began publishing the study in 1986, sales, 
foreclosures and loan restructurings by Tokyo-based companies surpassed the 
amount of their brand-new investments in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, the survey's findings mark the official end of a nearly 
decade-long buying spree in which Japanese investors purchased some of 
America's most treasured properties, including Rockefeller Center in New York 
and the Pebble Beach golf course in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those deals have soured. Pebble Beach was resold at an estimated 
$340-million loss in 1992, and Rockefeller Center now is worth less than the 
Japanese owe on it. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems these troubled investors now face are rocking boardrooms in 
Tokyo, Rodman said. But they are also having a broad -- if subtle -- impact on 
the lives of many people in California, where about a third of Japan's U.S. 
holdings are located. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Japanese were building new projects and buying prized U.S. properties 
-- such as the jet-black, twin towers of Arco Plaza in Downtown Los Angeles -- 
back in the 1980s, they helped to fuel a development boom that provided 
literally thousands of high-paying jobs, ranging from construction work to 
office management. 
</P>
<P>
 The buying spree also pushed property values here higher, providing local 
governments with millions of dollars in sorely needed property tax revenue to 
pay for police, schools and a variety of other public services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese began to throttle back on their U.S. investments in 1990, shortly 
after their own stock market crashed and recession tightened its hold on the 
economies of both America and Japan.  
</P>
<P>
 Now attempts by Japanese investors to sell or renegotiate the loans on 40% of 
their U.S. holdings -- valued at about $77 billion -- could deal a serious blow 
to Southern California's battered real estate market, which only recently began 
showing solid signs of improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 The long decline in values for office buildings and most other types of 
commercial property finally leveled off last year and demand rose, raising many 
analysts' hopes that a pickup in construction activity could come by the end of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if the Japanese panic and dump all their properties on the market at 
once, everybody's property values will head south again, and it will delay a 
recovery in commercial construction right here in California," said Sanford 
Goodkin, a veteran real estate consultant from San Diego who works with big 
investors from both Tokyo and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Some investors from Tokyo have already moved to cut their losses from 
investments in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Dai-Ichi Semei America Corp. -- a U.S. affiliate of a big 
Japanese insurance company -- sold its half-interest in the 42-story AT&T 
Center in Downtown Los Angeles for about $24 million. It reportedly paid about 
$75 million for its 50% stake in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month, Sazale Group of Tokyo -- which paid $110 million in 1989 for 
the 92-room Hotel Bel-Air in West Los Angeles, or a record $1.2 million a room 
-- deeded the property back to its consortium of Japanese lenders to avoid 
foreclosure. Some local real estate brokers say the hotel is up for sale but 
that the lenders would be lucky if the facility fetched half of what Sazale 
paid for it five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese investors "are in a very delicate position right now," said Yukuo 
Takenaka of Takenaka & Co. Investment, a Los Angeles-based firm that advises 
several Tokyo-based companies.  
</P>
<P>
 "If they keep the properties they have here, some will continue to lose 
millions of dollars. But if they sell all at once, they could make a bad 
situation worse. . . . This is not a pleasant situation, for either the 
Japanese or the Americans." No Yen for Real Estate 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese investment in U.S. real estate has been plunging since 1988, as 
property values declined and recessions took hold on both sides of the Pacific 
Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese investment in U.S. real estate, in billions of dollars: 1985: $1.86 
1986: 7.53 1987: 12.77 1988: 16.54 1989: 14.77 1990: 13.06 1991: 5.06 1992: 
0.81 1993: 0.71

GAO REPORT CRITICIZES C-17 SETTLEMENT; MILITARY: THE AGENCY SAYS MCDONNELL 
DOUGLAS WILL PAY ONLY $46 MILLION OUT OF POCKET, NOT THE $454 MILLION AS FIRST 
ANNOUNCED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Pentagon settled its dispute with McDonnell Douglas over the C-17 cargo 
jet on unfavorable terms for U.S. taxpayers and then suggested those terms were 
tougher on the company than the data actually showed, according to the General 
Accounting Office. 
</P>
<P>
 GAO officials were expected to tell a Senate Armed Services Committee panel 
today that McDonnell Douglas will pay only $46 million in out-of-pocket costs 
under the C-17 settlement -- not the $454 million that defense officials 
claimed when the deal was announced last December. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it is a lousy deal," said Louis Rodrigues, the GAO's director of 
system development and production issues, who helped author a report issued 
late last week that was sharply critical of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Replied McDonnell spokesman Larry McCracken: "It is not a bad deal. The 
government is on record and we agree that it removes the gridlock over the 
claims and the disputes." 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell had blamed much of its $1.4-billion cost overrun on the cargo jet 
program on government mismanagement. Under the settlement, the Pentagon agreed 
to buy just 40 C-17s and consider additional aircraft in 1995 only after it 
determines whether McDonnell improves its performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress will have to approve legislation to authorize and pay for the 
settlement, although the Pentagon has not yet made a specific request for 
additional money, a congressional aide said. Congress could block the deal if 
it sides with the GAO. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Congress is only taking a tough look at the settlement and no 
opposition to it has materialized yet. A congressional staff member said that 
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), chairman of the subcommittee holding today's 
hearing, "is keeping an open mind about the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO report, titled "C-17 Settlement Is Not a Good Deal," also asserts that 
the cost of the transport jet continues to soar, while the aircraft is dogged 
by reliability and performance problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rising program costs, less than anticipated performance, and lengthy delays 
raise serious doubts about the C-17's cost-effectiveness and undermine the 
program's credibility," the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO recommended that Congress reject the Pentagon's settlement provision 
calling for the purchase of 40 aircraft and the consideration in 1995 to buy 
additional planes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should make our decision now, not in 1995 when we will be $5 billion 
further into the program," Rodrigues said. "All it does is pump more money into 
the program and you don't have any additional information about the cost 
effectiveness of the plan to make the decision."

GLENN RESIGNS AS PRESIDENT OF FLUOR ENGINEERING UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first step in a reorganization of its upper management team, Fluor 
Corp. on Monday announced the departure of Gerald M. Glenn, a group president 
of the company's core engineering and construction unit, Fluor Daniel. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn, 51, one of two who shared the top position at the subsidiary, resigned 
from his post, as well as from Fluor's board, "to look for other 
opportunities," said Leslie G. McCraw, Fluor chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also announced the promotion of two top executives to vice 
chairmen of the board: Vincent L. Kontny, 56, president and chief operating 
officer of Fluor, and Hugh K. Coble, 59, the second group president of Fluor 
Daniel. 
</P>
<P>
 "These changes are not indicative of any problems at the company," said John 
Simon, an analyst with Seidler Cos., a brokerage in Los Angeles. "Fluor is just 
wondering what it wants to do with the rest of its life. How does it expand 
without repeating mistakes of the past?" 
</P>

 In the early and mid-1980s, Fluor suffered a series of losses after straying 
from its core interests to invest in such businesses as real estate and gold 
mining. The company recovered after a reorganization in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor's revenue last year was $7.9 billion, more than twice what it reported 
for 1987. Today it has a long list of impressive projects, including the 
cleanup of a closed uranium plant in Ohio -- a $2.2-billion federal contract 
for the largest environmental remediation project to date. In recent weeks, 
Fluor's stock has traded at more than $50 a share -- compared to $15 a share in 
1987. In New York Stock Exchange trading Monday, Fluor shares fell $1.125 to 
$51.75.

U.S. EXAMINING MOTOROLA SALES OF LICENSES FOR WIRELESS LINKS; TELECOM: REVIEW 
BY JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PUTS DEALS ON HOLD. TECHNOLOGY WOULD COMPETE WITH 
CELLULAR PHONES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Justice Department is reviewing Motorola Inc.'s proposed sale of radio 
licenses to buyers seeking to build a wireless network to rival the cellular 
phone industry's. The move is the latest in a recent series of government and 
court actions that have slowed the race toward consolidation in 
telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department has asked for details on more than $2 billion worth of 
pending mergers that would transfer so-called specialized mobile radio (SMR) 
licenses, a digital, wireless telephone technology that uses a portion of the 
airwaves now employed mainly by taxi dispatchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Motorola -- a major chip maker and the leading manufacturer of 
hand-held SMR transceivers -- agreed to sell scores of its SMR licenses to 
Nextel, CenCall Communications Corp. and Dial Page Inc. in exchange for stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department would not comment on its probe, but a Nextel official 
and a former Justice Department lawyer said it is concerned that the deals 
might give Motorola too much control over the nascent SMR industry. Motorola 
would have major equity stakes in the three major SMR providers, and the three 
companies are expected to buy billions of dollars' worth of equipment that uses 
Motorola's SMR technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The transactions are being watched closely because they would increase 
competition with the fast-growing cellular phone network by speeding the 
introduction of digital wireless phone services. SMR phones, now offered in Los 
Angeles by Nextel, can convert voice and other communications into numerical 
codes with less distortion and much greater capacity than the analog 
telecommunications systems now in use.  
</P>
<P>
 Robert Foosaner, Nextel's vice president of government relations, said Justice 
Department lawyers have twice requested information from his company, but he 
said they gave no indication that the deal with Motorola is in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you have an acquisition of any size, you hear from the Justice 
Department," Foosaner said. "While they've asked for information and made an 
inquiry, our response, so far, seems to have been satisfactory." 
</P>
<P>
 The news, however, did not torpedo CenCall, Nextel or Dial Page on Wall 
Street. Nextel was unchanged at $35 a share, CenCall fell 75 cents to $23.25, 
and Dial Page lost 12.5 cents, closing at $33. The overall market fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "this is pretty serious business," said Charles A. DiSanza, an analyst 
at Gerard Klauer, Mattison & Co.. He was one of several analysts who said a 
Justice Department review would have a chilling effect on investors' interest 
in SMR technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "If, for some reason, these acquisitions are not permitted, then it would not 
be possible for these companies to put together a sufficient number of channels 
to compete against cellular," DiSanza added. 
</P>
<P>
 The ex-Justice Department lawyer, who has closely followed the review of the 
deals, said that if the transactions are found to present antitrust problems, 
the agency could require restructuring some of the deals or ask that Motorola 
license its technology to all comers."

 McDonnell, Rockwell Post Gains: First-quarter profits announced by the two 
aerospace and defense companies reflected the results of deep cost-cutting 
efforts that have included the elimination of thousands of jobs. Earnings at 
McDonnell Douglas would have risen 30% if not for onetime charges last year.The 
St. Louis-based company earned $134 million, or $3.41 a share, compared to $216 
million, or $5.51 a share, during the first three months of 1993. Rockwell 
International Corp. said earnings increased 13% in its fiscal second quarter, 
led by strong gains in its largest division, electronics. The Seal Beach-based 
space shuttle builder reported a profit of $154.7 million, or 70 cents per 
share, for the January-March period, compared to $136.9 million, or 63 cents 
per share, a year earlier.

 Intel, Microsoft Profits Up: Intel Corp. said first-quarter net income rose 
12.6% as strong demand from the computer industry made up for a continued slide 
in profit margins. The semiconductor manufacturer said net income rose to $617 
million, or $1.40 a share, from $548 million, or $1.24, in the year-earlier 
period.Microsoft Corp. said profit from operations rose 38% in the third fiscal 
quarter, beating Wall Street's highest earnings estimate. Net income was $256 
million, or 84 cents a share, compared to year-ago earnings of $243 million, or 
80 cents. The most recent quarter includes a charge of $120 million, or 26 
cents a share, for damages to be paid to Stac Electronics stemming from a 
patent infringement lawsuit. Excluding the charge, Microsoft said net income 
would have been $336 million, or $1.11 a share.

 Zenith to Sell its CalFarm Life Unit: Zenith National Insurance Corp. of 
Woodland Hills signed a letter of intent to sell its CalFarm Life Insurance Co. 
subsidiary to Conseco Inc. of Carmel, Ind., for about $120 million in cash, the 
two companies announced.The deal is subject to the execution of a definitive 
agreement and regulatory approvals. Stanley R. Zax, Zenith chairman and 
president, said selling Sacramento-based CalFarm would bolster Zenith's 
financial position and allow it to focus on its primary business, workers' 
compensation insurance. Under the proposed sale, Zenith would retain CalFarm's 
group health business. CalFarm had $2.5 billion of life insurance in force at 
year-end 1993.

 Study Finds Immigrants Dominate Certain Professions: Immigrants are obtaining 
higher-paying jobs than native-born Americans in science, medicine and several 
other professional fields, and Asians are outdistancing all others in some 
fields, according to a U.S. Census-based study.The analysis, by the Center for 
Immigration Studies, found that foreign-born Indian doctors outnumber 
American-born blacks in medical practice in the United States. It also 
discerned a striking disparity in median salaries among racial groups and found 
significantly larger proportions of Asians and whites in the professions than 
either blacks or Latinos. "Asian professionals are outdistancing, numerically, 
their white counterparts in engineering, math and computer science, natural 
sciences, college teaching and medicine . . . " the report said.

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: LOW-POWER RADIO ADS GAIN IN FREQUENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dennis Hauswirth figures he can never get too much business. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, his auto upholstery firm has redone car interiors for celebrities such 
as Michael Jackson and Arsenio Hall. But darned if Hauswirth could devise a way 
to reach those thousands of other potential customers who each day drive by his 
shop at a Westside intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Then one day, click. 
</P>
<P>
 That clicking noise is the sound of a car radio turning on. No, Hauswirth 
didn't start buying costly ad time on some radio station. Instead, he started 
his own. For $300, he installed a low-power radio transmitter to broadcast 
promotions for his shop 24 hours a day. Several large signs outside the shop 
advise drivers where to flick their radio dial to tune in. If you're within 
eyeshot of his sign, you're within earshot of his ad. 
</P>
<P>
 "In desperate times, you do desperate things to stimulate business," said 
Hauswirth, whose shop, Markel's Auto Interiors, has been at the busy 
intersection of Robertson and Pico boulevards since 1945. "If you're stuck in 
traffic and you see my sign, there's a chance you'll turn on your radio to hear 
my ad." 
</P>
<P>
 The 90-second ad has brought in several customers in just one month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind this unusual venture is Century City entrepreneur Andrew Milder, who 
operates what so far is the only outfit to install the low-frequency radio 
broadcasts at small businesses around town. Real estate agents are also hiring 
Milder to place the transmitters inside houses that are on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The transmitters look like telephone answering machines and work in much the 
same way. Promotional messages can be changed at any time by re-recording them 
on the high-tech devices, which contain computer chips that store voice 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first public uses of low-power radio broadcasts was at Los Angeles 
International Airport, which began airing them in the early 1970s. Signs on the 
freeway advise travelers where to turn for airport information. It has proven 
so successful that most major airports have since adopted the system, said 
Nancy Niles, a Department of Airports spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Milder is hoping that what's good for airports is great for retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Milder's 8-month-old Century City company, Business Broadcast Systems, 
installed the radio link-up at Hauswirth's auto upholstery shop. He has also 
sold the service -- which he calls Talking Shop -- to an accounting firm, a 
stereo store and a florist, among others. Most of his clients are on the city's 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I was driving through Beverly Hills a few years ago," Milder said, "I 
wondered, how can I connect the retailers with all of these people driving 
around with money to burn?" 
</P>
<P>
 That's when the concept of low-power radio hit him. Because the radio 
frequency is so low, it faces few restrictions from the Federal Communications 
Commission. "For the price of a transmitter, any company can be on the air," 
Milder said. 
</P>
<P>
 His firm also set up a transmitter at Paris Blooms, a florist at Fairfax 
Avenue and Olympic Boulevard. Owner Alan Gabbay said the radio ads are 
especially good at helping to sell "impulse" items such as stuffed toy animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics, however, are not sold on this new radio twist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Few people are really that motivated to sit in their cars and listen to 
advertising," said Michael Kamins, acting chairman of the marketing department 
at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, several real estate specialists are also testing low-power radio 
broadcasts. Agent Terri McCall uses low-power radio to broadcast information to 
potential customers as they drive by any of four residential properties she is 
trying to sell in Playa del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the houses have signs out front advising passersby where to set their 
radios to get information. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the way real estate will be sold in the future," said McCall, who is 
an agent at Fred Sands Realty. "It pulls more people into the homes." 
</P>
<P>
 On a somewhat larger scale, the concept is also about to be tested at the 
massive Ritter Ranch development in the Antelope Valley area of West Palmdale, 
where construction of 11,000 houses is to start this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ritter Ranch developers will use low-power radio broadcasts as public 
relations tools. 
</P>
<P>
 "During construction, a lot of nearby residents are likely to get upset," said 
Peter Wenner, general manager of the project. There will be plenty of road 
detours -- as well as construction debris that gets neighbors' cars dirty. "But 
what if people were able to turn on the radio and hear -- as our way of 
apologizing for any inconvenience -- where they can go for a free car wash?" 
Briefly . . .  
</P>
<P>

COSTA MESA-BASED TAM'S FILES BANKRUPTCY PLAN; RETAIL: THE STATIONERY CHAIN 
BLAMES A DISPUTE WITH THE CREDITOR THAT FINANCED ITS PHOTOCOPIERS. NO CLOSURES 
ARE PLANNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blaming a dispute with a major creditor, increased competition from office 
supply superstores and the slow economy, Tam's Stationers Inc. said Monday that 
it has filed for bankruptcy reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 Tam's, which opened its first store near USC in 1947, is profitable and will 
not close any of its 20 locations in Southern California or lay off any of its 
225 employees, President Michael R. Davis said. In fact, the Costa Mesa-based 
company still intends to open several new stores in the coming year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The filing Friday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana was designed to help 
Tam's overcome short-term financial problems caused by an ongoing dispute with 
Imaging Financial Systems, a wholly owned subsidiary of General Electric Credit 
Corp., Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Imaging Financial Systems financed more than 100 photocopy machines placed at 
Tam's stores. Tam's filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy 
code after Imaging Financial Systems won a court order earlier this month 
allowing it to seize the machines. The bankruptcy filing freezes that order, 
said Marc Winthrop, an Irvine-based bankruptcy lawyer who is representing 
Tam's. 
</P>
<P>
 Loss of the copiers would have been a serious blow because "the photocopy 
service is a large aspect of Tam's overall business," Winthrop said. "They've 
been trying to work something out, but the value of the machines is worth a lot 
less than the balance of the debt." 
</P>
<P>
 Tam's listed $2.9 million in assets and $5.8 million in debt in the filing. 
The company said it had 1993 revenue of $16 million and was profitable, though 
it did not say how much it earned. 
</P>
<P>
 The privately held company operates stores throughout Southern California, 
most of them near university campuses. It offers a wide selection of stationery 
and office supplies and, like competitors, relies heavily on its copying 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said Tam's remains "a very strong company with good profitability" 
despite the slow Southern California economy and increased competition from 
large office supply stores such as Office Depot and Staples. Rather than 
competing directly with the office supply giants, he said, Tam's is 
repositioning itself with smaller stores, lower-priced photocopying and better 
service.

CROWN'S GLITTER MAKES SALES PITCHES EASIER; TELEVISION: PRINCE EDWARD AND 
DUCHESS OF YORK COURT BROADCAST EXECUTIVES FOR THEIR OWN PRODUCTIONS. 
</P>

 There is little doubt that the British Royal Family sells -- just ask the 
editor of any magazine what happens when they put a royal on the cover. But 
this week, at the world's biggest international TV market, two royals have 
taken the exploitation of their names into their own hands in very different 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief career in the theater with Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really 
Useful Company, Prince Edward has set up Ardent Productions, using the 
unassuming title of Edward Windsor on his business cards. He arrived at the 
Marche International des Programmes de Television, or MIP convention, here over 
the weekend with hundreds of other hopeful producers to pitch his programs to 
broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately Edward's trip coincided with that of another royal, Sarah 
Ferguson the Duchess of York, who was launching the animated version of her 
book "Budgie, the Little Helicopter." The prince's bodyguard, pointed out, 
however, that the two would not cross paths, because his entourage left Sunday 
as the duchess arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of both royals brought quite a different tone to this bland 
business market. With a swarm of British tabloid press and photographers 
following the prince around Cannes, a rumor that the Queen Mother had died 
spread from the Carlton Hotel to the Palais des Festivals in an hour Saturday 
before it was denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince Edward valiantly tried to mingle with the business crowd throughout the 
market. Flanked by two English bodyguards and two French secret service agents, 
he could be found at the bar of the Martinez Hotel along with all the others 
producers trying to tap into the $4-billion international TV market. At a party 
Saturday after his first day at MIP, he was looking a little worn but said he 
had enjoyed his first day in international television. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very good," he offered, rubbing his hands together and glancing 
nervously at a reporter's press badge, "very busy but very interesting." He was 
reluctant, however, to discuss his program ideas: "If I do it for you I have to 
do it for everyone, and that wouldn't be fair," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing is, they (the tabloids) just don't understand that this is a 
hard-working business weekend," said Eban Foggitt, Edward's partner in Ardent. 
"They can't believe we traveled down here economy (class), and they can't 
believe we are staying in a regular hotel by Cannes standards. It's the 
ordinariness of it they can't comprehend." 
</P>
<P>
 He was right. Saturday's tabloids, which have been trailing Edward hoping for 
some news about his relationship with Sophie Rhys Jones, carried headlines of 
"Eddie steady with the readies as he saves for weddies" (The Daily Mirror), 
reporting that he sat near the toilets in the economy section of a British 
Airways flight and stayed at the Hotel Cristal for a mere $150 a night. 
</P>
<P>
 While Ardent's requests for meetings were better received than any other 
first-time British producer with no credits, Foggitt insists Ardent does not 
use the royal connection unduly. "We choose to be judged on the quality of our 
product," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But arriving at meetings with a cortege of bodyguards and a trail of tabloid 
photographers does create an impression, and, as one industry executive pointed 
out, Edward's access to a ready fund of development money through his own 
personal wealth or that of his family had the television industry "swarming 
like bees around a honey pot." 
</P>
<P>
 An industry consultant added: "The difference is that he has money, unlike 
every other independent producer, and there is a real danger he may be taken 
for a ride." 
</P>
<P>
 Ardent did tie up one deal at MIP, entering into a development agreement with 
the colonial alliance of Australia's Nine Network, Television New Zealand and 
Canada's Baton Nine. Baton Nine Chairman Bruce Gyngell was blunt about Edward's 
heritage being a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course it makes a difference that he is a prince," he said. "If Kevin 
Costner offers me a series about Indian Americans and another guy offers me the 
same show, who am I going to take if from? A prince is a product advantage, and 
if I have him presenting a program instead of someone else, of course I have an 
advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Ferguson also found her royal title a "unique selling point" at the 
dinner for "Budgie," a show about a mischievous helicopter that was inspired by 
her flying lessons. She dined at the ritzy La Ferme de Mougins with 200 guests 
culled from the 9,000 MIP attendees. 
</P>
<P>
 The official walk-around by Fergie, as the British papers affectionately call 
her, deteriorated into a tacky scramble as a table of Japanese buyers requested 
photographs of themselves with the duchess. For the next hour, 200 people were 
individually greeted and photographed with Ferguson.  
</P>
<P>
 Did she think being here helped market the show? "I'm not here to sell," she 
said. "I am here to talk to people. It really is a dream come true to see my 
character come to life."

AMERICAN TO OFFER NONSTOP FLIGHT TO N.Y.; TRAVEL: ANNOUNCEMENT OF SERVICE FROM 
JOHN WAYNE COINCIDES WITH SUMMER FARE DISCOUNTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a move that will benefit business and leisure travelers, American Airlines 
said Monday that it will start nonstop service between Orange County's John 
Wayne Airport and New York's John F. Kennedy Airport, beginning June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline made the announcement as major carriers posted new price discounts 
for summer travel. Northwest Airlines initiated the fare reductions on Sunday 
and was quickly matched by other carriers, with discounts on non-refundable 
tickets as deep as 40% during the peak summer travel season. 
</P>
<P>
 American said it will offer a daily round-trip flight that will leave Orange 
County at 8 a.m. for New York. The return flight will depart from New York at 
5:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is quite consistent with our . . . plan, which is to look for new 
opportunities that make economic sense," said Tim Smith, spokesman for American 
at its Fort Worth, Tex., headquarters. "The support we've gotten from business 
people in Orange County has been superb." 
</P>
<P>
 American now operates 39 flights at John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Orange County is a major destination for business travelers, no 
airlines now offer nonstop between John Wayne Airport and New York, an airport 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 America West offered nonstop New York service briefly in 1991 but dropped the 
two daily flights in December that year when the carrier, based in Phoenix, 
began restructuring under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code, spokesman 
Dick Shimizu said. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest discounts will be available on American's new coast-to-coast 
service for as little as $358 round trip with a 14-day advance purchase. The 
so-called "walk-up fare" -- the price that a traveler would pay if he or she 
simply walked up to the counter and bought a ticket without making reservations 
-- will be $682. 
</P>
<P>
 Other discount round-trip fares include John Wayne to Minneapolis, $378; and 
Detroit, $398. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets must be purchased by April 27. The prices apply to destinations in 
Canada and all states except Alaska. Trips must be completed by Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County travel agencies said Monday that they don't know whether prices 
will go lower, but that the newest fares are a good deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think 40% off is a good buy," said Greg Judd, president of the McDonnell 
Douglas Travel Co., the Irvine-based travel subsidiary of the aerospace 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Agent Rika Lott at Newport Bay Travel in Lake Forest said she has not received 
many calls so far in response to the air-fare cuts, but typically "we get a lot 
at the last minute." 
</P>
<P>
 Ambassador Travel in Mission Viejo, however, reported that it was receiving 
more calls than it could handle from customers asking about reduced fares.

BRIEFCASE: HEALTH CARE; CHILD'S PLAY WILL BE LOW COST, HIGH TECH AT 
PACIFICARE'S NEW DAY CARE FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by James M. Gomez, Times staff writer

<TEXT>
<P>
 PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. just spent a lot of money on child's play. 
</P>
<P>
 The health maintenance organization on Monday unveiled its state-of-the-art 
day care center for children of its employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The PacifiCare Child Development Center, which cost $3 million to build, will 
charge employees between $85 and $115 a week to look after their children. That 
tuition price is about 80% of the cost at most private centers. 
</P>
<P>
 For PacifiCare employees, 76% of whom are women, the center is a welcome 
addition to the company's benefits package. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has always been a dream for me," said Lucy Cunningham, president of the 
PacifiCare Foundation, who joined puppeteer Shari Lewis to dedicate the 
facility. "It's wonderful to see that dream come true for me and a lot of other 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 The center, across the street from the company's headquarters in Cypress, has 
a two-story building equipped with everything from cribs to classrooms stocked 
with the newest child development aids, books and toys. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside is a 12,000-square-foot playground with a network of roads -- complete 
with highway signs -- that youngsters can travel on tricycles and pedal cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who helped cut the ribbon, said 
that a company-sponsored child care center is becoming more a necessity for 
two-income families. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that providing such a facility to workers is an example that should 
be emulated by the county, which employs about 12,000 workers. Wieder said that 
a study was conducted for the county as long as 12 years ago. At that time, she 
said, "the county was not ready for it." Now, the need cannot be ignored, 
Wieder said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the private sector can do it," Wieder said, "we ought to be able to do it. 
We should go out and explore that possibility."

 Smelling Thin: Ron Nicklaw has a nose for news. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach distributor for Nutrition for Life, a provider of 
weight-loss products, said he is hoping to cash in on a brand-new product that 
he said is revolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
 The product is called the Thin Pen, a pocket-sized device that Nicklaw said 
will pare unwanted pounds off people who simply stick it in their noses and 
take a sniff. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right. You just sniff the pen and watch your weight go down, Nicklaw 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thin Pen takes advantage of a recently completed study by a Chicago doctor 
who discovered that people who smelled certain aromas right before eating had a 
smaller appetite. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Alan Hirsch found that, of the 3,000 people he subjected to a variety of 
smells, such as green apple, banana and peppermint, he noticed average weight 
losses of five pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaw said he is beginning to market the three-set Thin Pens, which cost 
$31.95 for the apple, banana and peppermints scents, through the local 
newspapers and mail-order ads. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was skeptical at first," Nicklaw said. "But I had a chance to study it, and 
it looks real interesting."

 The Orange County office-space market showed signs of improvement during the

was nearly four times the previous year's first-quarter absorption of 86,812

SANTA ANA MAY LIMIT DATES ON YARD SALES; GOVERNMENT: THE COUNCIL HEARS FROM

<P>
 In an effort to crack down on illegal businesses and clean up neighborhoods, 
the Santa Ana City Council endorsed a plan Monday to limit garage sales to four 
designated weekends each year -- one every three months. 
</P>
<P>
 If the ordinance is approved, anyone holding a sale outside the four 
designated weekends could have their goods impounded by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than vote on a previously drafted ordinance limiting the sales to two 
weekends in May and two in October, Councilman Ted R. Moreno asked that the 
four weekends be spaced evenly throughout the year to accommodate residents who 
might be moving from their homes. The council will take up the issue again next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 The sales are a constant occurrence in some Santa Ana neighborhoods, where 
residents scatter worn clothing, used appliances, furniture, tires and 
televisions across front lawns, driveways and commercial parking lots, hoping 
to earn a few dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half a dozen people spoke in favor of the crackdown Monday, 
complaining that some residents hold garage sales weekly -- if not more often 
-- and should be required to obtain business licenses and operate in commercial 
zones.  
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Ana is looking like a Third World country. . . . I hope the City 
Council takes some action and bans yard sales," said resident George Estrada. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see people that have nine television sets, seven baby strollers and 
nine bedroom sets, that's not a yard sale," resident Betty Biner said. "I think 
it's become a disgrace and a blight on the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members and Santa Ana's numerous city-sponsored neighborhood 
associations have overwhelmingly supported a measure cracking down on the 
garage sales. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, however, the sales are an occasional practice that bring in needed 
dollars and serve a community of low-income shoppers who don't have cars to get 
to the closest swap meet or cannot afford the prices of secondhand stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert Belmontes, a resident of southwest Santa Ana, urged the council not to 
restrict the sales, and to focus instead on more serious problems plaguing the 
city. Belmontes said he holds garage sales in order to show his children what 
it means to earn an honest dollar in difficult times, he told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an honest way to do things. You are hitting at the people who are 
suffering the most economically, who make up the very core of this city," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 He said the people who abuse the privilege and turn the sales into businesses 
should not be allowed to "ruin" the majority's right to earn a few dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Code enforcement officials estimate there are between 300 and 500 garage sales 
on any given weekend day, making it far too cumbersome to enforce existing law, 
which allows only two garage sales a year per address. 
</P>
<P>
 That law, adopted in 1990, said garage sales could be held on three 
consecutive days, and restricted the goods to those of a "household nature." As 
outlined by the council Monday night, the new ordinance would restrict the 
sales to four designated Saturdays and Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Thomas E. Lutz also asked for a provision allowing churches, 
organizations like the Boy Scouts, and neighborhood associations to continue to 
hold sales as fund-raisers.

AGENCY STANDS FAST ON BOLSA CHICA OK; DEVELOPMENT: COAST PANEL DISCOUNTS 
COMPLAINTS THAT KOLL FIRM MISHANDLED HUMAN REMAINS, WON'T RESCIND PERMITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The California Coastal Commission has decided not to rescind its permission 
for the Koll Real Estate Group to build 4,286 homes around the Bolsa Chica 
wetlands, despite protests by Native Americans that the project could disturb 
important prehistoric burial grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision removes one of a series of governmental hurdles the company must 
pass before construction can begin. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, a new obstacle has been raised by the Army Corps of 
Engineers, which recently requested that the company delay demolition of a 
World War II bunker at the site pending determination of the structure's 
historical significance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of good news, sad news," said Lucy Dunn, the company's senior vice 
president, adding that Koll will postpone demolition of the bunker -- 
originally planned for this week -- at least several days to facilitate talks 
with the Corps of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Commission's action came in written response to a request by the 
city of Huntington Beach that permits issued to the company for the project be 
reviewed in light of allegations that human remains found at the site may have 
been mishandled. 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving complaints from Native Americans and others regarding the 
treatment of prehistoric bone fragments found at the site, the city two months 
ago requested a formal investigation into the matter by the Orange County Grand 
Jury. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Coastal Commission's response, however, its staff said it had uncovered 
no evidence of wrongdoing by the company or its representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "In summary," the staff reported in a memo dated April 13, the Koll company 
"is in compliance with the requirements of (its) permits, and there is no merit 
as to the grounds for processing a revocation request." 
</P>
<P>
 In a second memo, the commission's south coast district director, Charles 
Damm, also declined to reverse an earlier decision regarding the historical 
significance of two World War II bunkers originally located at the site. During 
the permitting process, he wrote, the commission had determined "that the 
bunkers are not of sufficient historic value to preserve. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 That view is not necessarily shared by the Corps of Engineers, however, which 
requested in a letter to the Koll company dated April 13 that it "abandon . . . 
plans to resume demolition of the bunkers on site until their national register 
eligibility is determined through consultation" with the state Office of 
Historic Preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Built by the Corps of Engineers in 1944, the bunkers were part of an elaborate 
defense system planned to protect the California coast from Japanese attack 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed to hold large gun emplacements at either end, they contained huge 
storage areas for live ammunition as well as latrines and sleeping quarters for 
their intended crews. Before the structures could be armed and manned, however, 
the war ended and the bunkers were abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll company bulldozers demolished the smaller of the two bunkers last year 
after obtaining the Coastal Commission's permission. Work on the larger one, 
however, was interrupted in November because of the rainy season. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Bruce Henderson, project manager for Bolsa Chica, the Corps of 
Engineers intends to make a determination within a few weeks to a few months 
regarding the historical significance of the remaining bunker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our people are willing to resolve this matter in the very short term, and I 
think we will do so," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Any determination of historical significance, he said, would eventually have 
to be confirmed by the Office of Historic Preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 But even such a determination would offer no guarantees regarding the future 
of the remaining structure, according to Gary Reindehl, an associate state 
archeologist with the Office of Historic Preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not ensure any kind of protection," he said. "Typically, it does not 
preclude a project from going forward."

POLISH PRIDE; FOLK DANCERS PROMOTE THEIR CULTURE WITH ENTERTAINMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Karolina Simon could have chosen jazz or ballet like other girls who love to 
dance. Instead, she picked folk dancing because it gives her a sense of family. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Simon's father is Hungarian, her mother is Polish, and she says her pride in 
her ethnic heritage has inspired her to be a folk dancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Dorado High School freshman in Placentia is the youngest member of the 
Gorale Polish Folk Dancers of Anaheim, the oldest Polish American dance group 
in Southern California. Simon says the group is "like a family." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Simon was a 15th-Century princess in a gold-and-fur costume during 
the group's two-hour show of Polish national dances at the Tustin Senior 
Center, where members of the Tustin Area Historical Society lustily applauded 
every number. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like entertaining people," Simon said. "And this is a way to show off our 
customs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gorale Polish Dancers, named after a mountain region in Poland, was formed 
in 1953 to promote Polish culture through folk dancing, said the group's 
director, Rick Kobzi, 41, of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Kobzi, who joined the group as a dancer in 1970, said they have at least 100 
performances a year across California and Nevada, and have appeared in movies 
and special events. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are committed to continue spreading the Polish culture in the West," Kobzi 
said. "This also gives our young people pride in their heritage." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the dances in last week's show, a retired Anaheim librarian, 
dressed in period costume, portrayed the life of Helena Modjeska, a Polish 
stage actress popular in San Francisco and New York in the late 1800s and early 
1900s. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Modjeska became a Shakespearean actress, she and seven other Polish 
immigrants established a farming community in Anaheim in 1876. But the grape- 
and winemaking venture lasted just a year, forced to bankruptcy by a drought in 
1877. 
</P>
<P>
 Opal Kissinger, who portrayed the Polish actress in last week's show, said 
Modjeska became an actress at age 37 in 1877. She was considered one of the 
best during her time. In 1888, she moved to Tustin and settled in what is now 
known as Modjeska Canyon. She died in Newport Beach in 1909. 
</P>
<P>
 A local historian, Stephen Gould, said that in addition to Modjeska, two 
Polish immigrants who helped form the Anaheim farming colony later became 
popular -- Henryk Sienkiewicz, a Nobel Prize-winning novelist, and geographer 
and illustrator Ludwig Louis Salvator. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim colony "was a miserable failure because they just wanted to write 
poetry and hunt and not work as farmers," Gould said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Polish American community in Orange County is relatively small, compared 
to those in Chicago, New York and other cities, Kobzi said. He said that about 
1,800 Polish American families are registered with the Pope John Paul II Polish 
Center in Yorba Linda. The center maintains a school that allows Americans of 
Polish descent to learn the Polish language. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, Kobzi said the center celebrates the annual Dozynki, a two-day 
festival that recalls the harvest festival in Poland in which peasants bring 
their produce to the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "The holiday tradition is very special in Poland," Kobzi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kobzi said that members of his dance group are mostly students and young 
professionals, ranging in age from 15 to 47. A majority speak Polish and some 
have gone to Poland on their own to learn the dances of their people. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Nowak-Przygodzki, 24, who has been a dancer since 1986, said that he went 
to Poland last year to learn the dances from the mountain region of Gorale. 
With his partner, Jonine Sodders, Nowak-Przygodzki dances the fast-paced oberek 
, which involves lifting the female partner and flipping her around the 
shoulders of the male partner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good exercise," said a smiling Nowak-Przygodzki, a business student at 
Cal State Fullerton.  
</P>
<P>
 Tustin resident Ruth Harmon said watching the Polish dancers gave her an 
insight into their culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was different and unique," said Harmon, who draws Victorian houses for a 
hobby. "The young people were vibrant and energetic. It's good that they can 
carry on their ethnic background."

SCOTT HARRIS: ADDRESSING LETTERS AND MARQUEE MESSAGES

 Jeanne M. Marks of Van Nuys writes: I have never been inside of Burbank High 
School, but I have driven by on many occasions . From the outside it does not 
look so bad. Your description of the gym alone made me cringe in disbelief. I 
cannot believe that the city of Burbank would allow it to get so bad . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Thank you, Jeanne, for easing my guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, when the $100-million bond measure to modernize the old, worn-out 
campuses in the Burbank Unified School District failed at the ballot recently, 
I wondered whether it might be my fault. A majority of voters -- 53% -- voted 
in favor of the measure that would have increased property taxes by about $33 
per $100,000 in assessed valuation, but fell well short of the two-thirds 
necessary for passage. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyal readers (and I'm sure that means all of you) may recall that, after 
describing the crummy conditions at 70-year-old Burbank High, I noted the 
Bulldogs, as Burbank's teams and students are known, could use a new kennel. Ha 
ha ha. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanne, a 17-year-old senior at Village Christian School, reassured me that 
not all readers wondered whether Burbank students should be treated like dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 One suspects that many voters, like Jeanne, drive past and assume the school 
just needs a fresh coat of paint. I wonder how many of the 47% who voted no 
took a tour of Burbank High, including the boys' locker room that coaches refer 
to as "the dungeon." Some officials suggest that many voters, especially senior 
citizens, fail to understand the need for adequate air conditioning in 
classrooms equipped with computers and other aspects of high technology. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials are still puzzling about what went wrong. And they promise 
they'll try again. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, there's some better news from Woodland Hills . . .  
</P>
<P>

 TAFT ACA DECA 
</P>
<P>
 GREAT TEAM/GREAT COACH 
</P>
<P>
 BEST IN USA 
</P>
<P>
 This is what Korengold, a Taft High parent, wrote on the old school marquee at 
the corner of Ventura Boulevard and Winnetka Avenue to honor Taft's national 
championship in the Academic Decathlon and coach Art Berchin. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's what the sign said Monday morning. I hope it's intact today. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Korengold is the mother of a Taft senior and two Taft grads, one of whom 
competed on the 1988 Academic Decathlon team. She is also the keeper of the 
school marquee. She puts the top down on her convertible to make room for a 
stepladder and changes the message every week or so. 
</P>
<P>
 She initially contacted me after reading a column last month concerning Taft's 
victory in the statewide competition. "THE AMPIONS," the sign had said. 
</P>
<P>
 Korengold wanted to let me know that the letters didn't fall off during an 
aftershock. When she went over to repair the sign, she found the metal letters 
had been stolen, and "only a few broken pieces of the metal letters were on the 
ground." The sign had been vandalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it's possible that vandals were little more than pranksters. Teen-agers 
could find a variety of uses for those letters. How many of us decorated 
friends' homes with toilet paper, Barbasol and those blinking construction 
warning signs? 
</P>
<P>
 Korengold, however, suspects that the vandals were students who resented the 
attention accorded Taft's academic heroes. "I almost fear for a Tonya Harding 
syndrome," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 We live in treacherous times, but the motives may have been less sinister. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, at my old high school, teachers and students arrived one morning to find 
a truly remarkable sight. The lunch tables had been stacked to form a pyramid. 
And crowning this monument was a familiar plastic lad taken from the local 
Bob's Big Boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that I'm trying to give kids today any ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Which leaves one last topic . . .

 Six question marks require an answer. But let's get this straight: I am not

 Spagnoli's seismic sonnets and quaking couplets, featured here recently, have

 Several readers have written or called to ask how to order copies. Among them

CITRON MAKES PUBLIC DETAILS OF INVESTMENTS; FINANCE: COUNTY TREASURER RESPONDS 
TO DEMAND OF POLITICAL CHALLENGER, WHO HAS CRITICIZED AGGRESSIVE HANDLING OF 
$7.5-BILLION PORTFOLIO AS TOO RISKY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BRAZIL and JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to a demand by his political opponent, County Treasurer Robert L. 
Citron for the first time Monday made public details of his aggressive 
investment of public funds -- which is viewed in the business both with respect 
and as risky. 
</P>
<P>
 After picking up more than 700 pages of investment data from the treasurer's 
office, John Moorlach, a certified public accountant and financial planner who 
is Citron's first challenger in 24 years, said he would spend the next "day and 
a half" deciphering them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get a handle on this thing," Moorlach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach has charged that Citron's investment strategies are far too risky and 
the recent rise in interest rates -- including another increase on Monday -- 
could result in substantial losses of taxpayer money. 
</P>
<P>
 The usually low-key county treasurer's race has attracted more attention since 
it was disclosed last week that the city of Tustin, worried about possible 
losses, withdrew the $4 million it had invested in the Citron-managed 
investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 As treasurer, Citron is responsible for investing both the operating and 
capital improvement funds of the county, as well as the county's pension funds, 
and his past success has attracted the funds of virtually every school district 
and almost every municipality in the county to an investment pool that Citron 
manages. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Tustin financial officials say the decision was motivated purely by 
business considerations, its action has taken on political overtones because 
Tustin City Council member Jeff Thomas, who works for Moorlach's campaign, was 
heavily involved in the decision to withdraw its funds. 
</P>
<P>
 While Citron has acknowledged recent "hits" on the $7.5-billion, county-run 
portfolio, he maintains that he has taken no undue risks with taxpayer money. 
The veteran treasurer also points to his performance over the past 15 years, 
which bond professionals and investment experts say is among the best. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue in the county-managed portfolio are Citron's use of "derivatives" and 
"reverse repurchase agreements." 
</P>
<P>
 In a reverse repurchase agreement, the holder of investment-grade securities, 
such as treasury bills or bonds, sells them subject to an agreement to 
repurchase the securities for a slightly higher price in the future. In the 
meantime, the cash that is raised through the first sale is invested in 
sometimes riskier securities that pay a higher rate of return. If the 
higher-paying securities do not lose value, as most bonds have in recent 
months, the strategy can be lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
 Derivatives are investments that are linked to the performance of some 
underlying asset such as bonds, foreign currencies or interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Though common, both kinds of investments require a high degree of investor 
sophistication, and predicting how they will perform is tricky. 
</P>
<P>
 Chriss Street, a local business executive and Newport Beach contributor to 
Moorlach's campaign, has expressed concerns about Citron's tactics to the Wall 
Street Journal, Forbes magazine and to Standard & Poor's, a bond rating service 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, Diane P. Brosen, a director with Standard & Poor's, said company 
analysts took a close look at the Orange County investment portfolio on March 
30. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any major concerns with the Orange County portfolio," she said. 
"If you look at the portfolio of any issuer the size of Orange County, you're 
going to find reverse repurchase agreements. It's not just Orange County, it's 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county's credit rating is very high, and we are confident the county will 
repay all the bonds in the pool, the school district bonds, everything. It's a 
very strong county, extremely well-managed." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been difficult for money managers, investment brokers and bond experts 
to comment on Citron's strategies because his portfolio had not been made 
public. In the next few days it is likely that the records released Monday will 
be circulated among industry insiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the amount of money Citron deals with and his admittedly aggressive 
tactics, he is well-known and word of the controversy has already spread far 
beyond local borders. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's aggressive," said Rod Rich, who handles a $500-million portfolio for the 
city of Seattle and chairs the investment committee for the Municipal 
Treasurers Assn. of the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether that's good or bad, that's up to individual interpretation, but he's 
known as an aggressive investor." 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Mlacnik, Monterey's treasurer and the president of the Calif. Municipal 
Treasurer's Assn., said, "He's a very, very progressive treasurer. Bob probably 
does a lot of things that people may think are risky, but I'm certainly not 
going to sit and criticize him. He's done wonderful things for the county. Bob 
knows what he's doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Turner, who retired after more than 30 years as city treasurer of 
Fullerton and Anaheim, having served as president of both the state and 
national treasurer's associations, agreed. "Bob is known throughout the 
industry as being a very astute investor," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 First elected as tax collector in 1970, Citron became treasurer when the Board 
of Supervisors combined the two positions in 1973. Since that first race, he 
has never again faced an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 He was among those who lobbied the state to expand the investment options of 
government agencies back in the 1970s. His success has lured many 
municipalities from outside Orange County along with nearly all the local 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The yields from his pool, which includes funds from 186 entities, has 
consistently been among the highest in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year he reports his high yields to an admiring Board of Supervisors, 
cities and school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I know," said Don Merz, Sonoma County treasurer, "he's never lost 
any money." 
</P>
<P>
 Only two cities in Orange County -- Garden Grove and San Juan Capistrano -- 
don't contribute to Citron's pool. Officials from both cities say Citron's 
returns are tempting, but they don't have the financial wherewithal to absorb 
any losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Some agencies, such as Los Angeles County and the state treasurer's offices, 
do not use reverse repurchase agreements because of the risk involved, but 
other counties, including San Diego and Ventura, do. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Sherwood, director of the investment division for the state treasurer's 
office, said he does not use reverse repurchase agreements, but "a lot of 
people would consider us conservative," he said. "We always put safety and 
liquidity first." 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin Mayor Jim Potts has said he is considering asking the city to return to 
the county's pool. He said politics is to blame for the entire turn of events.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 2 INDICTED IN PROBE OF FALSE TAX FILINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two former law enforcement officers, one of them a Huntington Beach resident, 
were indicted by a federal grand jury Monday on charges of making a false 
statement in their 1987 federal income tax return, according to officials with 
the U.S. Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment alleges that Stephen W. Polak, 45, a former Los Angeles police 
officer who now lives in Huntington Beach, and his former wife, Christina 
Townley, 39, a former Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, lied on their 1987 
federal income tax return, according to a statement issued by Assistant U.S. 
Atty.Mark A. Byrne. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the indictment, the total income reported on the return allegedly 
was substantially lower than the couple's actual total income for 1987, said 
Byrne, who is handling the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Polak nor Townley, who lives in Lakewood, could be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is part of an ongoing investigation by the "Big Spender Task Force," 
an anti-corruption unit composed of agents from the FBI, the Internal Revenue 
Service and the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, Byrne said in a prepared 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Spender investigation has resulted in the conviction of 21 former 
sheriff's deputies on various charges, including theft of narcotics proceeds 
and false statements on tax returns, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Polak and Townley each face a maximum sentence of three years in prison and 
$100,000 in fines. They are scheduled to be arraigned in federal court in Los 
Angeles on May 2.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; TRUCK DRIVER DIES IN FREEWAY CRASH

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 40-year-old Pico Rivera man was killed Monday when his tractor-trailer 
struck a center divider on the Orange Freeway, then veered back across the road 
and crashed into a sound wall, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, identified as Angel Miguel Martin, was pronounced dead at the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the California Highway Patrol, the left front tire of Martin's 
truck blew, causing him to lose control. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that he was killed, or at least knocked unconscious, (by) the 
first impact," said CHP Officer Angel Johnson, "and the truck drifted across 
the road." 
</P>
<P>
 The crash took place in the freeway's southbound lanes at Orangethorpe Road at 
11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A small diesel spill from the big rig's fuel tanks slowed southbound traffic 
for several hours, Johnson said. MARK I. PINSKY

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENC IN YOUR COMMUNITY; CENTER OFFERS CLOTHES,

 In a small section of a Northridge warehouse, 2-year-old Robin rummages 
through a toy-filled play area while his foster mother picks up clothes for 
Robin and his 1-year-old foster brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Rita Prechtl makes two trips a year to the warehouse, which houses the Foster 
Children's Resource Center, to gather clothes and toys for her foster family, 
which also includes a 7-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get underwear and sleepers and jackets and toys," said Prechtl, who's been 
coming to the center since it opened in 1990. "It's really nice for the 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 The center, a project of the Assistance League of Southern California, gives 
new and used clothes to foster children and children who have been returned to 
their parents after leaving state custody, said volunteer Elizabeth Yingling. 
</P>
<P>
 Open three days a week and run completely by volunteers, the center stocks 
underwear, socks, jeans, sweat suits, jackets, toys, even decorations for 
babies' rooms. Most of the new items are donated by manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many foster parents rely on the center for much of their children's clothes, 
volunteers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have families who come in and get everything here," said Sue Cornwell, who 
has volunteered at the center since it opened. About 20 families visit the 
facility each week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them make you just want to cry. They're so happy because they haven't 
had very much. They're so happy with anything you give them," Cornwell said. 
"You get a real dose of reality." 
</P>

Resource Center, call (818) 701-0506.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 'CLUB HOMELESS' RAZED BY CALTRANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Club Homeless" is no more. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Transportation on Monday razed the elaborate 
homeless encampment that had sprouted among the thick bushes near the San Diego 
Freeway's Beach Boulevard exit. 
</P>
<P>
 The crunch of bulldozers and the whine of chain saws signaled the end of a 
catchall community formed several years ago by a dozen or so homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one man was left at the camp Monday morning when Caltrans moved its 
equipment in: Craig Fritts, 38, who had lived in the tangle of acacia and 
oleander bushes for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should have respected us," he lamented, watching Caltrans workers pile 
items salvaged from the encampment -- including a tool box, a computer monitor, 
an ice chest and several chairs -- along a fence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a society there. A lot of people get hungry," Fritts said. "They came 
here for a sleeping bag and a meal." 
</P>
<P>
 The others have scattered, and Fritts said he doesn't know where he will go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope I don't go to jail. I just don't know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cleanup climaxed weeks of legal maneuvers, during which residents of the 
encampment filed appeals to halt Caltrans' removal efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, they succeeded. But last Tuesday, the 4th District Court of 
Appeal gave Caltrans the final go-ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Flyers were posted Thursday, giving the squatters three days to leave, 
Caltrans spokeswoman Rose Orem said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we had to do something," Orem said, citing safety and sanitation 
concerns. Huntington Beach police had complained about a rise in crime in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 The encampment's residents said they posed no threat and claimed they had told 
crooks who tried to join them to return purloined property. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans is set to begin a $1-million highway beautification project, which 
will include some new landscaping at the Beach Boulevard exit. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Caltrans was able to remove the homeless, their attorney, Paul 
Gray, said the whole brouhaha had a positive aspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a victory in that the situation of the homeless people has come to the 
public eye," Gray said. "The plaintiffs in this case knew they would have to 
move out eventually." 
</P>
<P>
 With Orange County's shelters and aid agencies filled to capacity, homeless 
advocates said Fritts and his friends will probably remain on the streets, but 
in a new location. 
</P>
<P>
 "They already knew about the shelters, but they didn't want to go there 
because they wanted some freedom," said Paul Wager, program coordinator for the 
Mental Health Assn. of Orange County. "They enjoyed living there. They had put 
a lot of time and energy into it and made it a home. I think if they hadn't 
been removed they would have lived there indefinitely." 
</P>
<P>
 Karen McGlinn, executive director of SOS, a Costa Mesa social services agency, 
said several Club Homeless residents, who she described as friendly and 
resourceful, came regularly to SOS for sack lunches and emergency financial 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm worried about them," McGlinn said. "But these people manage to do things 
that are unbelievable. They'll probably figure out a way to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 As he hopped on his old blue-and-white bicycle to leave Club Homeless for the 
last time, Fritts stopped to read from an ode to the encampment he had penned 
the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 Entitled "Bush No. 405," it read, in part: "But to walk on your rich soil is 
to always find a home in our hearts without any need to have a house, for the 
love and need we seek can only be found under our very own feet."LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; CITY TO CO-SPONSOR FUND-RAISING EVENT 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has agreed to co-sponsor a carnival next month at the Seal Beach 
Naval Weapons Station despite opposition from a few residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual event is being organized by the Seal Beach Chamber of Commerce to 
help nonprofit groups raise money.The groups can run merchandise booths at the 
carnival, which will include food vendors and 30 amusement park rides. 
</P>
<P>
 Two residents at Monday's council said the city should not be involved in the 
fund-raising event. One of the residents questioned whether all the 
organizations that take part in the carnival are properly registered with the 
state as nonprofit groups. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Jerry L. Bankston said the organizations must have state licenses 
in order to receive booths. He said many of the groups -- which include the 
local animal shelter and PTA -- have previously sought financial assistance 
from city. But the city has been unable to fund the groups because of its tight 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach will spend no money organizing the May 12-15 event. The city will 
provide security, but the chamber has agreed to reimburse Seal Beach for all 
costs.SHELBY GRAD

<P>
 A public hearing on an ordinance that would ban smoking in public places will 
be held at 7 tonight in City Council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ordinance would restrict smoking at places of employment, 
buildings accessible to the public and other public places. 
</P>
<P>
 If the amendment is adopted as written, the city would be the first in North 
County to enact the ban and would join Laguna Hills as the only cities in the 
county to ban smoking both in restaurants and workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar ban was adopted late last year by the county Board of Supervisors, 
but it affects only unincorporated areas of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Americans for Nonsmokers Rights, a national anti-smoking group, 
Dana Point, Huntington Beach and Laguna Beach are phasing in a smoking ban at 
restaurants. 
</P>

 San Juan Capistrano already has a ban.DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; MAN DIES IN HEAD-ON CRASH ON FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 23-year-old Santa Ana man was killed early Monday in a head-on collision 
when he drove the wrong way on the Riverside Freeway, the California Highway 
Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers said they believe Guadalupe Medina Albarran was under the influence 
of alcohol when his pickup collided head-on with a station wagon just west of 
Coal Canyon Road in Anaheim Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was partially ejected from the pickup and was pronounced dead at the 
scene, according to Officer Robert Polzin. 
</P>
<P>
 Three occupants of the station wagon, the 19-year-old driver, a 35-year-old 
woman and a 15-year-old girl, all from Moreno Valley, sustained moderate

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; BEACH CLOSED WHILE WATER BY SPILL TESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Health officials said Monday that a half-mile portion of beach will remain 
closed today while test results are completed after a sewage spill over the 
weekend at the mouth of the Santa Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Merryman, director of environmental health for the Orange County Health 
Care Agency, said the beach was closed Sunday because of the possible hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we close (the beach) is we always act in protecting public health 
and safety," Merryman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sewage spill forced the closure of a quarter-mile stretch of beach on each 
side of the river's mouth. Warning signs were posted at both Huntington State 
Beach and Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Orange County Sanitation Districts said the results of 
water samples taken Monday are to be completed today to determine the level of 
water contamination. Merryman said if the water testing comes back clean, the 
beach could reopen this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 He said treated sewage water that is normally discharged four to five miles at 
sea leaked from a pipe and spilled into the Santa Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
 Merryman said the spill, noticed by Huntington State Beach lifeguards, was 
relatively small -- estimated at between 5,000 and 7,500 gallons of waste 
water. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; MERCHANT HOPING FLAG WINS SALUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A splash of paint has once again become an issue in the city, where a merchant 
will ask the City Council today to let him keep a painting of a U.S. flag on an 
awning above his store. 
</P>
<P>
 James T. LaFave, who owns Galaxy Sports Inc. at 1045 S. Coast Highway, painted 
his rendition of the flag on the wooden awning for the July 4 holiday in what 
he says was the spirit of patriotism. 
</P>
<P>
 When business picked up, he decided to leave it, prompting an objection from 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month LaFave took his case to the city's Design Review Board, which 
deemed the painting "garish and out of character with the neighborhood" and 
rejected it, 5 to 0. 
</P>
<P>
 LaFave said Monday that he is proud of the flag and discouraged by the 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe America was started with great intentions, if nothing else," he 
said. "A lot of that intention has been lost in our layers of government." 
</P>
<P>
 But Design Review Board member J.J. Gasparotti said the flag is about 
advertising, not Americanism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nowhere on the American flag do the words Galaxy Sports appear," he said, 
although they are part of LaFave's painting. "It's a sign, it's not patriotism 
and it doesn't accurately reflect the American flag. I thought the Karagozians' 
flag was a lot better than this one." 
</P>
<P>
 Gasparotti referred to an instance in 1991 when the city blocked Nick and 
Denise Karagozian from moving into their new home because it was painted a 
whiter shade than had been agreed upon by the couple and the Design Review 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by strong public support, the Karagozians had a protest party to paint 
a side of their house red, white and blue. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually they were allowed to move in after repainting the house a 
compromise shade of white. 
</P>
<P>
 LaFave, 32, said he has also received some community support. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an old building and it's ugly, actually, without any sort of 
decoration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 LaFave and a store employee painted the flag in early July. He denies that it 
is garish or inaccurately represents the American flag. 
</P>
<P>
 It is "as close to an American flag as we can paint," LaFave said. "All the 
lines are perfectly straight, the colors are accurate, everything is good." 
</P>
<P>
 He maintains that the city should not force him to erase the flag, which he 
said is helping him through tough economic times by catching the attention of 
potential customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the city . . . has been far too strict with the merchants and I 
believe they're somewhat crippling this business environment in Laguna Beach," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city staff is recommending that the City Council deny LaFave's appeal.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; 2 COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE SWORN IN TODAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tracy Worley and Michael J. Doyle will be sworn in as the newest members of 
the City Council today. A new mayor and mayor pro tem also will be elected 
during the five-member council's first session since the April 12 municipal 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley, 34, received 2,526 votes, the most among the four candidates for two 
seats. Doyle, 51, garnered 2,400 votes. Each was elected to serve a four-year 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley and Doyle replace Leslie Anne Pontious and Charles E. Puckett, each of 
whom served a single term. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Deputy City Clerk Valerie Whiteman said that the 19.1% voter turnout was 
about the same as the turnout for the 1992 city election. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection of a city mayor will be the first test of the new political 
alignment on the five-member council. By tradition, the current mayor pro tem, 
Thomas R. Saltarelli, should be elected mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Jim Potts, who campaigned for Doyle and Worley, may now have the 
votes to sway council decisions. In past council actions, Potts often cast the 
lone dissenting vote. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; EFFORT TO ELIMINATE TOLLWAY BOOTHS FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite pleas from Newport Beach residents, an Assembly committee in 
Sacramento turned its back Monday on efforts by an Orange County lawmaker to 
eliminate toll booths planned for a stretch of Newport Coast Drive slated to 
become part of the San Joaquin Hills tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill by Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) got only one vote in 
the Assembly Transportation Committee, far short of the nine needed for the 
measure to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 An angry Ferguson charged during the hearing that tollway officials had 
hatched "a very involved scheme" to impose a toll on motorists who currently 
use Newport Coast Drive for free. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the tollway agency has yet to conduct proper hearings on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Corona del Mar are concerned that the tolls will divert traffic 
to Coast Highway as an alternative route, thus increasing congestion there. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, they question whether the county has the authority to turn a 
publicly owned road over to the tollway agency. 
</P>
<P>
 They want the county to build a free alternative to the tollway along the 
route of Newport Coast Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Stockstill, a tollway agency spokesman, told the Assembly panel that 
the toll booth issue is among hundreds that were discussed during numerous 
public hearings in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This issue was known," Stockstill said, adding that efforts to reopen the 
debate would "provoke lengthy and costly litigation" that could delay or derail 
the tollway project. 
</P>
<P>
 Tollway officials contend it would take an endowment of $69 million to 
generate the income equal to the toll revenue that would be lost if the booths 
were eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson, however, argued that the agency could simply pass the extra cost on 
to motorists traveling along other parts of the 15-mile tollway, which would 
connect the Corona del Mar Freeway in Newport Beach with Interstate 5 near San 
Juan Capistrano. ERIC BAILEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; HARVARD AVE. TO LOSE 4 LEFT-TURN SIGNALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city began removing left-turn signals from four Harvard Avenue 
intersections on Monday in an effort to improve traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is part of a yearlong traffic program that has led to the removal of 
30 left-turn arrows throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the signals cause motorists to endure unwarranted delays and 
are not needed at many uncrowded intersections. The left-turn arrows force some 
drivers to wait as long as two minutes before making turns. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can end up wasting time for people," said Arya Rohani, the city's 
transportation manager. "We want to make it easier for people to get through." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest round of signal removals occurred in the Westpark area near City 
Hall. The affected intersections are at San Juan, San Leon, San Marino and San 
Carlo. Other left-turn lights have been taken down in residential villages such 
as Northwood and Woodbridge, and in industrial areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Rohani said that in all cases, city officials determined that the lights did 
more to slow traffic than ease it. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials stressed that left-turn signals on busy streets will remain. City 
rules require turn signals on streets with speed limits of more than 50 m.p.h. 
and at intersections with double left-hand turn lanes, Rohani said.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; RECYCLING ISSUE LEFT IN TRASH PACT TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Negotiations for a new trash disposal contract are nearly complete, with one 
issue remaining before an agreement is reached with the city's current waste 
hauler, according to a report that will be presented to the City Council today. 
</P>
<P>
 The only issue left is deciding who should be responsible for making sure Lake 
Forest can comply with a state law requiring cities to reduce the amount of 
trash delivered to landfills by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Waste Management of Orange County, formerly Dewey's Rubbish 
Service, has paid for starting and maintaining the city's recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiators for both sides met March 23 but were unable to settle the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials pointed out in the staff report that several cities, including 
Mission Viejo, have contracts that require Waste Management to pay for future 
recycling costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was awarded an exclusive waste disposal franchise by the county 
before the city incorporated in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Reviewing the contract two years ago, the council told city staff to begin 
negotiating a new deal with Waste Management before the current pact expired. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has asked for a five-year contract with a two-year option based on a 
performance review. 
</P>
<P>
 The residential rate would be $12.75 per month for each household, with 
increases subject to the Consumer Price Index. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest residential trash customers currently pay a $13.78 monthly fee per 
household. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; SCHOOL CONTRACT TALKS CONTINUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Union and management negotiators met for two hours Monday and reported 
progress in averting a strike of classified workers in the Orange Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a good meeting," said Jack Elsner, head of district personnel."It was 
a problem-solving meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 Another negotiating session will be held next week. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue are union complaints of unfair labor practices and a controversial 
school board-imposed contract that cuts health benefits, imposes furloughs and 
allows the district to lay off employees without negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials have accused the district of negotiating in bad faith during 
11 months of contract talks. The union has filed complaints against the 
district with the state Public Employment Relations Board. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials deny the charges of unfair labor practices and say the 
contract, which saves the district about $485,000, is vital to keep the school 
system financially solvent.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; NEWPORT TO DRILL WATER WELLS AT SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fountain Valley School District Board of Trustees has granted Newport 
Beach an easement to drill two wells and build a pump station at an elementary 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Building the well and water-pumping station at Hisamatsu Tamura Elementary 
School was opposed by some nearby residents who feared the wells would cause 
noise and vibration, and the building would block views. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees have proposed a new location for the pump station on a large grassy 
area at the rear of the school on its eastern boundary, which is away from 
homes. Trustee Robert Sedlak said the new site minimizes residents' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 No residents addressed trustees at last week's meeting. The district has 
conducted three public hearings and one community meeting regarding the well 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees last week approved a resolution agreeing that the Tamura well site 
does not have any significant adverse environmental effects. The district also 
negotiated a 10-year lease with Newport Beach, under which it will be paid 
about $20,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Staneart, Newport Beach utilities director, said that construction is 
expected to start in mid-September and take about five months. 
</P>
<P>
 The wells are part of a $16-million well project by the city, which will 
provide water to more than 70,000 customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach cannot pump its own well water because seawater has contaminated 
the underground water supply, Staneart said, adding that it is cheaper for the 
city to drill for water than to buy imported water. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach is planning to construct four wells in Fountain Valley. 
Negotiations are underway to build the other two wells on a second site, 
Staneart said.DEBRA CANO

DANA POINT RESIDENTS SEEK VOTE ON HEADLANDS DEVELOPMENT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of local residents opposed to a controversial $500-million hotel and 
residential plan for the Headlands has launched a petition drive to bring the 
issue to a citywide vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The group began circulating a petition last weekend calling for a referendum 
on the City Council's April 5 vote to approve the plan, said Doug Thompson, 
leader of the petition effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just a bunch of folks who decided this was too important an issue to 
go by without a vote," Thompson said. "We don't think the city cut the best 
deal possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The council-approved plan allows a future developer to build a 400-room hotel 
and 370 homes on the 121-acre Headlands near Dana Point Harbor. The council is 
negotiating a development agreement with the landowner that would bind the city 
by contract to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 If project foes gather 1,800 signatures -- a figure that represents 10% of the 
city's approximately 18,000 registered voters -- by May 4, the council would be 
forced either to repeal its decision or put the plan on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm anticipating we'll have more than enough signatures," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1940s, the Headlands property has been owned by the M.H. Sherman Co. 
and Chandis Securities Co. Chandis Securities, which oversees the financial 
holdings of the Chandler family, is a major stockholder in Times Mirror Co., 
which publishes The Times.

COUNTY JOBLESS RATE HOLDS AT 6.7% IN MARCH; EMPLOYMENT: STEADY FIGURE AND A 
REPORTED SLIGHT INCREASE IN HIRING SUGGEST AN ECONOMIC UPTURN MAY BE AT HAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN CHRISTIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reports that Orange County's jobless rate stayed static in March at 6.7% as 
local businesses posted a slight increase in employment fanned cautious 
optimism Monday that the county's economy verges on an upturn. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of non-agricultural jobs in the county grew by 3,100 for the month 
to 1,110,000 from February's 1,106,900, said Eleanor Jordan, the state 
Employment Development Department's labor market analyst for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Boosts in construction, manufacturing and service jobs contributed to the 
total increase, according to the statistics that track economic conditions in 
the county more closely than the broader-based unemployment rate released 
Monday by the EDD. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase in local jobs was partially due to seasonal shifts in employment. 
Construction and retail businesses generally pick up in spring after a slump 
during the post-Christmas period. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman University economist Esmael Adibi tempered the apparent good news by 
pointing out that despite the boost in employment in March, a total of 6,000 
local jobs have disappeared since March 1993, forcing many workers to seek 
self-employment opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Payroll employment is still declining on a year-to-year basis, which 
indicates that companies are resisting hiring," he said. "Companies are meeting 
an increased demand for goods and services with existing employees by asking 
them to work overtime." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Adibi said, there are clear signs of improvement and ultimately 
businesses will have to hire new employees to meet increased demands. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, Orange County fared significantly better than Los Angles County, 
which showed a jobless rate of 9.4% in March, down from 9.7% in February. 
California as a whole had a drop in unemployment of nearly one percentage 
point, from 9.8% to 8.9%. Orange County's population has a higher median income 
and education level than the state's. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores Cronin, owner of Corporate Careers Inc. -- an Irvine recruiter of 
salespeople for companies -- said she has seen the beginnings of an economic 
turn-around.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our job orders have doubled since this time last year," she said. "It's a 
very good indicator that the economy is picking up. When companies start to 
turn around, they first need salespeople, then they need to support the sales 
effort by adding to their manufacturing and distribution departments." Jobless 
Rate Steady 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's March unemployment rate was 6.7%, the same as in February. The 
number is slightly up from March, 1993, when it reached 6.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 March 1993: 6.6% April: 5.9 May: 6.5 June: 7.1 July: 7.9 Aug.: 6.9 Sept.: 7.1 
Oct.: 7.0 Nov.: 6.0 Dec.: 5.7 Jan. 1994: 7.2 Feb.: 6.7 March: 6.7

GROUP PRESIDENT LEAVES FLUOR; TWO PROMOTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first step in a reorganization of its upper management team, Fluor 
Corp. on Monday announced the departure of Gerald M. Glenn, a group president 
of the company's core engineering and construction unit, Fluor Daniel. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn, 51, resigned from his post as well as from Fluor's board of directors 
"to look for other opportunities," said Leslie G. McCraw, chairman and chief 
executive officer of Fluor. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also announced the promotion of two top executives to vice 
chairmen of the board: Vincent L. Kontny, president and chief operating officer 
of Fluor, and Hugh K. Coble, group president of Fluor Daniel. 
</P>
<P>
 "These changes are not indicative of any problems at the company," said John 
Simon, an analyst with Seidler Cos., a brokerage in Los Angeles. "Fluor is just 
wondering what it wants to do with the rest of its life. How does it expand 
without repeating mistakes of the past?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the early and mid-1980s, Fluor suffered a series of losses after investing 
in such non-core businesses as real estate and gold mining. The company lifted 
itself from its abyss after a massive reorganization in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor's revenue last year was $7.9 billion -- more than twice what it reported 
for 1987. Today it has a long list of impressive projects, including the 
cleanup of a closed uranium plant in Ohio -- a $2.2-billion federal contract 
for the largest environmental remediation project to date. In recent weeks, 
Fluor's stock has traded at more than $50 a share -- compared to $15 a share in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you try to stay level, you're probably going to end up moving backward," 
McCraw said in an interview last week. "So we are challenging our organization 
to think through how we can do better tomorrow what we do today." 
</P>
<P>
 McCraw said the changes are part of an effort to reduce the company's 
hierarchy and give younger executives more responsibility and exposure to the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're developing a succession plan, looking at people who range in age from 
45 to 52 -- the next wave," McCraw said. "This new structure will give some 
people greater visibility and will allow them to get more experience in 
management decision-making." 
</P>
<P>
 McCraw said that the company will continue to announce changes over the next 
few weeks but that he does not expect more resignations. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn "certainly was positioned for consideration" for a higher post, McCraw 
said. "His leaving was voluntary. He felt uncomfortable with some of the 
elements of the changes in our organizational structure." 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn joined Fluor in 1964. Twenty-two years later, he helped the company form 
Fluor Daniel -- a merging of two subsidiaries. In 1986, Glenn became a group 
president of Fluor Daniel in charge of marketing. Coble, also a Fluor Daniel 
group president, oversees operations for the subsidiary.  
</P>
<P>
 Coble, 59, has worked at Fluor since 1966, serving in several posts overseas. 
Kontny, 56, joined the company in 1965 and became president of Fluor in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In Monday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Fluor's stock closed at 
$51.75, down $1.12.

NIXON IN SERIOUS CONDITION AFTER SUFFERING STROKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Former President Richard Nixon suffered a stroke Monday evening and was rushed 
by ambulance from his home in New Jersey to a hospital here, where he was 
reported in serious but stable condition in an intensive care unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The 81-year-old former chief executive, the only President ever forced to 
resign his office, had not spoken since the stroke occurred at 5:45 p.m. as he 
was preparing for dinner at his home in Park Ridge, N.J., spokeswoman Kim 
Taylor said. After falling ill, Nixon managed to summon the housekeeper, who 
called an ambulance, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctors said he is in stable condition," said New York Mayor Rudolph W. 
Giuliani, who met at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center with Nixon's 
daughter Tricia Cox. Nixon's other daughter, Julie Nixon Eisenhower, was en 
route to his bedside. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did have a stroke," Giuliani said. "He is not able to speak. . . . He has 
not spoken yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon was being treated with anticoagulants. 
</P>
<P>
 Evangelist Billy Graham, a close family friend, arrived at the hospital on 
Manhattan's Upper East Side late Monday to offer comfort. "He means a great 
deal to me," Graham said. "I preached at his wife's funeral in California. I 
have a great personal affection for him." Pat Nixon died last year of lung 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given his virtual indestructible character, it's hard to think that President 
Nixon could have anything like this happen to him," said Kenneth L. Khachigian, 
a Republican consultant in San Clemente who served as a speech writer in the 
Nixon White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Khachigian, who is also on the board of directors of the Nixon Library in 
Yorba Linda, said he was concerned about Nixon's health but optimistic that he 
will quickly recover. 
</P>
<P>
 As the nation's 37th President, Nixon served in the White House from January, 
1969, to August, 1974, when he resigned to avoid impeachment in the Watergate 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Few political figures in the nation's history have been so controversial and 
so enduring. In later years, Nixon adopted the role of elder statesman, quietly 
advising presidents and traveling the world. 
</P>
<P>
 A month ago, he traveled to Russia, where he appeared in good health. During 
the visit, he met with such opposition leaders as Alexander Rutskoi and 
Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Those conferences drew displeasure from Russian President 
Boris N. Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon said he planned to report to President Clinton on the results of the 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
 After serving for eight years as Dwight D. Eisenhower's vice president, Nixon 
was defeated by John F. Kennedy in the tightly contested 1960 presidential 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 But eight years after that loss, Nixon ran again and was elected with a pledge 
to end the Vietnam War. On Jan. 27, 1973, a cease-fire was signed in Paris. By 
the time of the signing, he had won a second term in a landslide over Sen. 
George S. McGovern, an anti-war Democratic activist. 
</P>
<P>
 The former President began his career in California as a dedicated 
anti-communist congressman. But as commander-in-chief, he moved the United 
States dramatically closer to China and established a policy of detente with 
the Soviet Union, negotiating arms control agreements with its leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time he retreated from the limelight after Watergate, but later regained 
public attention through his travels, speeches, articles and books. 
</P>
<P>
 But his association with Watergate never really faded. In 1986, a Gallup Poll 
reported that three-fourths of those surveyed still thought Nixon deserved to 
be forced from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 A month after Nixon resigned, his successor, Gerald R. Ford, pardoned him for 
all crimes that Nixon "committed or may have committed or taken part in" during 
his term in office. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I was not involved in the decision to conduct the break-in, I should 
have set a higher standard for the conduct of the people who participated in my 
campaign and Administration," Nixon said. "I should have established a moral 
tone that would have made such actions unthinkable. I did not," he wrote in his 
ninth book, "In the Arena." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon said he viewed Watergate -- the break-in by White House operatives at 
the offices of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate office 
complex -- as "one major defeat in a career that involved both victories and 
losses, both peaks and valleys." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, soon after leaving the White House, Nixon suffered a life-threatening 
attack of phlebitis and complications from surgery to contain the blood clots 
in his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, doctors successfully removed a cancerous tumor from behind his left 
ear. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, he was hospitalized for treatment of a viral infection, and in 1988 
he underwent minor hernia surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Strokes afflict an estimated 500,000 people in the United States every year, 
killing 150,000, making them the third-leading cause of death in the country. 
More than 70% of strokes occur in people over the age of 65. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common kind of stroke is a thrombosis, blockage of a blood vessel in 
the brain by a clot that has gradually built up on the wall of an artery in the 
brain. Next most common is an embolism, a similar blockage caused by a clot 
that forms elsewhere in the body and moves to the brain. Nixon has a history of 
clot formation in his legs, so this is most likely the type he had. The least 
common type of stroke is a hemorrhage, bleeding within the brain caused by the 
rupture of a blood vessel. 
</P>
<P>
 Blockage of a blood vessel impedes the flow of oxygen to brain cells in the 
immediate area, leading to their death if the flow is not restored quickly. 
When these cells die, parts of the body they control can't function, causing 
impairment of movement, speech and even thought. The impairment is usually 
permanent because dead brain cells do not regenerate. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to forestall cell death, physicians frequently use tPA, a 
biotechnology-based drug commonly used in heart attacks, to try to dissolve the 
clot. Blood thinners, such as aspirin, warfarin and heparin, are also used to 
reduce the risk of further clot formation.

MARINES WILL EXPEDITE PULLOUT FROM EL TORO; MILITARY: SOME UNITS MAY BEGIN 
LEAVING IN EARLY SUMMER. OFFICIALS HOPE TO VACATE THE O.C. BASE BY 1996. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Marines may begin leaving El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in early summer 
and hope to be out entirely by 1996, more than three years ahead of the 
scheduled October, 1999, closure date. 
</P>
<P>
 A "migration plan" of Marine units at El Toro shows that three units are to 
begin moving to Miramar Naval Air Station in San Diego by July 1 and be 
completely in place by Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine spokesman Col. Dan Pender Monday declined to provide specific details 
about the early departure from El Toro, saying only "we want to start moving 
this summer." 
</P>
<P>
 A federal official confirmed the early departure plan late Monday afternoon in 
a statement to a meeting of the county's El Toro Reuse Planning Authority's 
executive council. Most people at the meeting -- including representatives from 
the county, various cities and the business community -- took the announcement 
of the stepped up departure plan in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Marines and government made an economic decision in the interest of 
taxpayers to get the process moving," said Thomas Edwards, president of the 
Airport Working Group, which favors using El Toro as a commercial airport. "If 
they hadn't accelerated it, the departure could have languished, running up the 
cost of closing El Toro." 
</P>
<P>
 Documents obtained by The Times show there are several hurdles to completing 
the move to Miramar, including a lack of Marine funding for the relocation, 
questions about the environmental impact of helicopter operations at the jet 
base and finding housing for Marines and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Navy headquarters in Washington is studying the possibility of 
consolidating Marine and Naval FA-18 squadrons on the West Coast at a base in 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Pender said relocation "plans change literally from day-to-day." In an 
interview last week, he said the Marines planned to be at Miramar "before 
1999." 
</P>
<P>
 "The quicker we can move down, the quicker we can close (El Toro), reduce 
maintenance and save money. Our plan right now is that we need to be gone by 
1999. If we can get the funding to accomplish this sooner, we will," said 
Pender. 
</P>
<P>
 A military source familiar with plans to move the Marine units, mostly FA-18 
squadrons, to Miramar said the Marines are also studying the possibility of 
moving even sooner than July, possibly as early as May. The migration plan 
obtained by The Times shows that Marines plan to complete the move from El Toro 
by March 1, 1996. There are approximately 6,300 Marines and 125 aircraft at El 
Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a meeting at Miramar in January, where the Marines told the Navy 
they had been instructed by their headquarters in Washington to begin the move 
to Miramar ASAP," said the source, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 The big issue for the Marine departure, Pender said on Monday, is getting 
funding for the move. The Corps has "absolutely zero" in funding this year to 
make the move from El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no approved plan; no funded plan," he said in the interview at his 
base office. "Right now headquarters (in Washington) is working on the money 
issue with the Navy and trying to obtain funding for the move." 
</P>
<P>
 Documents obtained by The Times show that the Navy had planned as early as 
December, 1993, to turn Miramar completely over to the Marines by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "Currently, the base (Miramar) is envisioned to be realigned to the USMC in 
fiscal year 97. At that time the installation will become a Marine Corps Air 
Station," said a Dec. 15, 1993, Navy memo. The 1997 fiscal year will begin on 
Oct. 1, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy has worried, however, about problems the Marines are having in 
keeping the schedule. Another Navy memo in December complained that the 
Marines' plans to begin moving to Miramar in 1994 "shift with the tide. . . . 
One week, (it is) execute as quickly as possible . . . next week delay 
movements until fiscal year 95." 
</P>
<P>
 A source familiar with the memo said the Marines' "on again, off again 
approach to the move" is dictated by the uncertainty of the Department of 
Defense funding to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The memo also warned that an environmental impact study being done on the 
transfer of 138 helicopters from El Toro and the Marine air station in Tustin 
to Miramar may be a "potential show stopper." 
</P>
<P>
 Pender said the Marine environmental study of Miramar began in October and 
will take between 18 months and two years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "Federal law says we have to move from El Toro and Tustin. I don't know what 
will happen if the (environmental) study says we can't do that," said Pender. 
</P>
<P>
 Presently, there are no helicopters at Miramar, which is used exclusively by 
Navy fixed-wing aircraft, mostly F-14 fighters and a few FA-18 attack fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Another potential problem in the move, is where to house the Marines and their 
families once they move to Miramar, said Pender. The Marines will give up 2,727 
housing units at El Toro, Pender said. 
</P>
<P>
 The source, who is familiar with the Navy's plans to vacate Miramar, said Navy 
officials informed the Marines the Navy will not give up any of its Miramar 
housing, most of it new. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no military housing available in San Diego for the Marines," the 
source said. "They've told the Navy that they want all of the housing at 
Miramar, but the Navy isn't budging. They said, 'We built it with Navy money. 
You're getting our base but not our housing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Marine and Navy officials have been discussing the housing issue, Pender said, 
but he refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 The consolidation of FA-18 squadrons is one final complication to the 
potential move. A memo from the office of the chief of naval operations in 
Washington raised the issue of how long the Marine FA-18 squadrons would stay 
at Miramar. 
</P>
<P>
 The March 2, 1994, memo said the Navy is studying a cost-cutting proposal that 
would put all Navy and Marine FA-18s at the same base. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Navy pilots said that if the Navy opts to base all FA-18s at the same 
airfield, the West Coast site will probably be Leemore Naval Air Station, near 
Fresno, which currently only has FA-18 jets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leemore is the F-18 capital. The base has all of the infrastructure needed to 
maintain F-18s. The Navy has the F-18 simulator, engine overhaul facilities, 
maintenance facilities and engine test stands there," said a Navy aviator 
familiar with the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Pender said he was unaware of such plans, and added that the Marines have 
similar equipment at El Toro and would be moving it to Miramar. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Monday, County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider 
said the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority board members will ask the federal 
government for a six-to-eight month extension to review and respond to a 
proposal from the federal Bureau of Prisons to convert the base to a prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agencies, such as the prison bureau, have priority over local 
governments to develop the base property. So far, the prison bureau, the Air 
National Guard and the Marine Corp Reserves have made pitches for the land. 
Prison officials said they would not attempt to force a prison on the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Defense was expected to make a decision on those requests 
June 1 but will probably delay making a ruling because of the county's request 
for a time extension. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison issue was a source of concern for the 50 representatives of an 
advisory council to the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, which met Monday. 
Several panel members said they opposed the prison plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory council decided to meet and discuss organizational issues next 
month. The reuse planning authority will eventually make three reuse 
recommendations to the Board of Supervisors, which will decide what the county 
would do with the site. El Toro Timetable

<P>
 The Pentagon plans to move about 6,300 Marines and 125 aircraft at El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station to Miramar Naval Air Station in San Diego by March 1, 
1996. The proposed schedule for their departure: 1994 Unit: Departure date

TB OUTBREAK IN O.C. WAS PREVENTABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A massive outbreak of tuberculosis at La Quinta High School in Westminster 
"could have been prevented" if private physicians who diagnosed the disease in 
a 16-year-old girl had informed county health authorities and her treatment had 
been closely monitored, said a report released Monday by the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The report concludes the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control's 
investigation of the 1993 outbreak, in which 12 students were found with 
related cases of drug-resistant tuberculosis and 292 more were found infected 
with tuberculosis bacteria that could become active in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The tuberculosis outbreak at La Quinta highlights the need for health 
departments nationwide to focus more resources on fighting the disease, which 
only a decade ago had been virtually eliminated in the United States, said 
federal public health officials. The disease has had a resurgence with 
increased immigration from Third World countries. La Quinta has a large 
percentage of Vietnamese in its student body. 
</P>
<P>
 While public health officials describe the Orange County incident as the 
largest school-based outbreak of drug-resistant tuberculosis in United States 
history, they said the public health shortcomings encountered in trying to 
control it are common throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the problems in Orange County were failure by private physicians to 
report the disease, inadequate treatment of the patient believed to have spread 
the disease among classmates, and failure to monitor her compliance with 
treatment, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to those shortcomings, the county's chief health officer Monday 
asked the Board of Supervisors to add $1.5 million a year to its $85-million 
annual public health budget to beef up tuberculosis prevention and 
investigation activities. The proposal will go to the board for consideration 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hugh Stallworth, Orange County's public health officer, said he would use 
the money to add 33 positions, including public health nurses and a public 
health medical officer, to the 70-member staff now assigned to tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the La Quinta outbreak, the Orange County Health Care Agency has taken 
several steps to improve its ability to combat the growing threat of 
tuberculosis, including hiring a public health nurse to serve as a liaison 
between the county health agency and private physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires hospitals, laboratories and private physicians to report 
immediately suspected cases of communicable diseases such as tuberculosis to 
county health officials so they can take necessary steps to prevent epidemics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have been more aggressive," Stallworth admitted Monday, referring to 
the possibility that the county might have intervened earlier in the original 
patient's care. "But this is a brand new arena, telling doctors how to practice 
medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 The findings were also being assessed Monday by state health officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "One lesson learned is that we need to do a lot more," said Dr. Richard 
Jackson, chief of communicable disease control for the state Department of 
Health Services. "La Quinta is the classic example of the event no one wants 
repeated." 
</P>
<P>
 The findings of the Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, were published in 
reports received Monday by state and county officials and presented Monday at 
the federal agency's Epidemic Intelligence Service Conference in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "The outbreak could have been prevented with earlier recognition and closer 
monitoring," the report said, noting that the girl believed to have spread the 
disease might have been contagious for 30 months before she was removed from 
school at the end of her junior year to prevent any further spread. 
</P>
<P>
 She had a persistent cough symptomatic of active tuberculosis in January, 
1991, the report noted, but her physician did not diagnose tuberculosis until 
13 months later, and then failed to report the diagnosis to the county health 
department. County officials said the physician might have delayed notification 
pending confirmation by lab results. 
</P>
<P>
 County health officials learned of the diagnosis four months later, the report 
said, when results of a sputum culture were reported to them by the testing 
laboratory, as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
 But even after that, the county was unable despite repeated attempts to obtain 
information from the two attending physicians (including a pulmonary 
specialist) to determine if the student's treatment was adequate, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A review of medical records by the CDC showed that the student's two 
physicians did not document whether she followed the prescribed daily treatment 
regimen. Also, a review of pharmacy records showed she infrequently filled her 
prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Penny Weismuller, the county's manager for disease control, said the 
student was born in Southeast Asia and most likely contracted a drug-resistant 
strain of tuberculosis before moving to the United States. Her disease was 
probably activated by puberty, when sudden growth undermines the body's immune 
system, Weismuller said. 
</P>
<P>
 The student was not placed on an adequate combination of drugs by her 
physicians and did not take the medication properly, she said. As a result, she 
said, the student's infectious period was prolonged. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Kenneth Castro, director of the CDC's division of tuberculosis 
elimination, said that problems in stopping the spread of TB at La Quinta are 
similar to the those the CDC has found in other TB outbreaks in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro said public health departments nationwide have been caught unprepared 
for the resurgence of TB, caused in part by increased immigration from Third 
World countries and the concurrent spread of the HIV epidemic, whose victims 
are particularly susceptible to drug-resistant forms of TB. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Renee Ridzon, who wrote the CDC's report on TB at La Quinta, said the 
outbreak "underscores the need for prompt recognition, treatment and 
bacteriologic monitoring of all cases of tuberculosis." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the report's recommendations were that the county should develop 
education materials on TB for all Orange County physicians, review the 
propriety of treatment by private physicians, monitor patients to catch any 
relapses, and keep a lookout for tuberculosis that has a drug-resistant 
pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these recommendations have been implemented or are in the process of 
being implemented," Stallworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 In asking the board for additional funding, Stallworth said he wants an 
enlarged staff to implement his plans to skin-test all students who are new to 
Orange County and similarly to screen for TB all new prisoners to Orange County 
jails within 24 hours of their admission. 
</P>
<P>
 The county needs more staffing to make certain that TB patients complete their 
treatment, which can take up to a year, Stallworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will assess early on the likelihood of someone following therapy and, if 
there is any question, we will make arrangements to have the person observed 
taking medication. If they can't come to us, we will go to them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of such vigilance, he said, is to reduce the chance that TB 
patients may infect others or develop drug-resistant TB, which can be deadly.

O.C. SOFTWARE FIRM'S STOCK PLUNGES; EXECUTIVES QUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Platinum Software Corp. was plunged into turmoil Monday after four top 
executives quit and the company said it had overstated revenue for the past 15 
months. The news sent the company's stock plummeting by 64% in furious trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum, a fast-growing maker of custom accounting software for large and 
medium-sized companies, also said it will lay off an unspecified number of its 
820 employees, restate revenue for the past four quarters and report a 
"substantial" loss for its third fiscal quarter, which ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to be a massive accounting fraud," said Alan Schulman, a San Diego 
attorney representing some shareholders who are suing Platinum for alleged 
securities violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce C. Edwards, who stepped in Monday as Platinum's acting chief financial 
officer, would not comment except to say, "You would expect an attorney to say 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum, Orange County's largest software company, announced the executive 
departures and other changes in a news release that said it discovered its 
accounting problems as a result of its own investigation stemming from the 
shareholder suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the departures was Platinum's founder, chairman and chief executive, 
Gerald R. Blackie. His temporary replacement is Carmelo J. Santoro, a Platinum 
director and former chairman of AST Research Inc. in Irvine, the nation's 
fifth-largest personal computer maker. 
</P>
<P>
 Santoro said a number of transactions at Platinum appear to have been recorded 
as revenue for quarters before the deals were actually completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a strict interpretation, we were putting revenues in the wrong place," he 
said. "It's almost impossible to conceive that, with a restatement of this 
nature, the SEC will not get involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Securities and Exchange Commission were unavailable for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum announced its news before the stock market opened Monday. By the end 
of the day, Platinum shares had fallen $6.44 to close at $3.56. Nearly 4 
million shares changed hands, making the stock one of the most actively traded 
Nasdaq issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, this is a very large negative surprise," said Frank Michnoff, 
analyst at Prudential Securities Research in New York. "This restatement of 
revenue casts a shadow on the (company's) whole future." 
</P>
<P>
 Santoro and Edwards, who is chief financial officer for AST and has been on 
Platinum's board since October, will now be the company's sole directors. 
Santoro retired several years ago as chief executive of Silicon Systems Inc., a 
Tustin-based computer chip maker. He is known as an active independent board 
member, playing a role in the ousters of top executives at AST and database 
software company Ashton-Tate, just before it was acquired by rival Borland 
International. 
</P>
<P>
 Santoro said he will move fast to form a new management team. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's announcement by Platinum's new management culminated an investigation 
that Santoro and Edwards began in January after the shareholder lawsuit pointed 
out irregularities in the timing of some reported sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Shareholder Ezriel Tauber filed the suit Jan. 19, a day after Platinum's stock 
fell 24% when the company announced cancellation of a major order. In the suit, 
Tauber accused the company of withholding vital information from investors 
preceding the price tumble. 
</P>
<P>
 Santoro said Monday that the lawsuit seemed routine at the time but that, as 
the two directors investigated further, they grew increasingly concerned about 
how the company was stating its revenue. Ernst & Young completed its review on 
Thursday, and Arthur Andersen the next day withdrew its previous year's 
accounting opinion for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1993, in which Platinum 
had reported sales of $65 million. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the departing executives were available for comment. Besides Blackie, 
they are Jon R. Erickson, chief financial officer; and executive vice 
presidents Kevin P. Riegelsberger and Timothy J. McMullen. 
</P>
<P>
 The company expects to report revenue of $13 million to $15 million for its 
latest quarter and to post a "substantial loss from operations." The company 
said layoffs will result in a onetime restructuring charge of $7 million to $10 
million. Revenue for the previous four quarters could be trimmed by $6 million 
to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum said it will also revise the way it records revenue from software 
licenses, or deals in which it collects royalties from companies that buy its 
software. 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum has ballooned in size since going public in October, 1992. With $22.5 
million in cash from its initial stock offering, Platinum has acquired seven 
software firms in the past year, more than tripling its staff from 230 in 
December, 1992. At a seminar two months ago, Erickson said the company was 
moving so fast on acquisitions that it was considering two deals every week and 
that its executives were often on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The company makes financial management software for so-called client/server 
computers, or networks of personal computers attached to powerful workstations 
known as servers, which perform common tasks. Such networks are replacing 
conventional centralized computers at major corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum's software and consulting service, which generates hundreds of 
thousands of dollars from each customer, is popular because of the immense 
shift toward client/server computing that has taken place in the past several 
years. Platinum's Stock Trend

NO TIME FOR TEEN ANGST; ACTING: WIL HORNEFF DRAWS ON HIS 'GOOD SIDE' TO PREPARE 
FOR THE TORTURED YOUTH ROLES HE KEEPS PLAYING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Wil Horneff saves the teen traumas for his film and TV work. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of his peers, the New Jersey high-school freshman skateboards, 
swims, Rollerblades and does his homework. He also just happens to have 
teen-dream good looks. While his friends let off steam in competitive sports, 
Horneff has parlayed any teen Angst he might have into acting. 
</P>
<P>
 "My problems are nothing compared to the kids I've played," Horneff says from 
his Saddle Ridge, N.J., home. "The problems I have are things to do with 
acting, like when I'm working. Otherwise, I'm just easygoing." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two years, he's played a romantic post-pubescent who commits 
suicide, a computer whiz chased by a homicidal computer, a nasty Little League 
team leader, and a tortured juvenile turned killer. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a lot of emoting from a 14-year-old, especially from one whose mother, 
describes him as "a very focused, respectful child." 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Horneff, who heads a performing arts center, recounts the traumatic time 
a tree-house fell on Wil's sister, breaking her pelvis in five places. "The 
first thing he said when he heard, very calmly, was 'Let's pray, Mom.' So we 
did, and he went on to calm his siblings (another sister and a brother). If he 
has any troubles, he works it out on a boxing bag in his bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
 Horneff's emotional roller-coaster of acting roles has paid off. In the next 
two weeks, he appears in two upcoming CBS made-for-television movies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the "The Yearling," which airs Sunday, Horneff plays the isolated country 
boy Jody, who lovingly rears his pet deer, Flag, and comes of age as a result 
of unfortunate and tragic events. Peter Strauss and Jean Smart play Jody's 
parents in the adaptation of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' 1938 Pulitzer 
Prize-winning novel. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 1 and 3, Horneff dons soldier's garb as young Willie Marsden -- played 
as an adult by Donald Sutherland -- in the CBS miniseries "Oldest Living 
Confederate Widow Tells All." Willie, an innocent, not only witnesses the death 
of his best friend, but has to kill. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare for the roles of Jody and Willie, Horneff says he used his "good 
side." He adds, "There's a little of me in there and then I use my good side to 
become the characters." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yearling" director Rod Hardy believes Horneff consistently made the right 
choices in playing Jody, even if the young actor didn't trust himself. "He was 
always saying to me, 'Can't I do just one more take?' It's very exciting 
working with Wil. He's an amazing talent." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Konigsberg, executive producer of "Oldest," couldn't agree more: "He 
gave a depth of emotion to his character and a kind of sensitivity rarely seen 
in a kid his age. He was able to convey a real sense of loss for someone who 
hasn't experienced that kind of pain." 
</P>
<P>
 His co-stars are equally impressed. For Strauss, it's Horneff's combination of 
innocence and talent. "He has this extraordinary sensitivity and absence of 
cynicism that's present in so many teens today," Strauss says. "That may be 
remarkable parenting, but there was such a fragility, sensitivity and awe to 
him, he was a complete joy to work with." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Horneff diligently follows the guidelines his parents set for him in selecting 
roles. "There are basically three rules," Horneff says. "One, we're Christians 
and I can't do any role that offends God or our beliefs. Two, we don't do 
anything that will disorient the family or break us apart or keep us apart for 
too long. Three, it can't affect my education." 
</P>
<P>
 That education includes being tutored daily when he's on a set and attending 
an all-boys Catholic school when at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Horneff always finds his way to Saddle Ridge, despite the travel demands of 
his work. The CBS films were shot back-to-back last winter -- "Yearling" in 
Charleston, S.C., and "Oldest" in Atlanta. Since 1992, the teen-ager has spent 
time doing movie roles in Los Angeles ("Ghost in the Machine") and Salt Lake 
City ("Sandlot") and worked in New York on the TV show "Law & Order." Traveling 
was fine, he says, "But I always miss home and New Jersey." 
</P>
<P>
 After a rocky start in commercials ("At 7 I did like 50 auditions and only got 
one"), he made his professional stage debut at 13 in John Guare's black comedy, 
"Four Baboons Adoring the Sun," at the Lincoln Center Theater in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't enjoy it," he says. "It was so boring doing the same thing, day 
after day." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he hoped to become a young idol, Horneff explained why he didn't: 
</P>
<P>
 "I really want to avoid that teen-idol syndrome. If you're popular for awhile, 
and then someone else comes along and you get replaced, you wonder if your 
acting will fall through, too." 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Yearling" airs Sunday , 9-11 p.m. "Oldest Living Confederate Widow 
Tells All" airs May 1 and 3 at 9-11 p.m. Both are on KCBS-TV Channel 2 and 
KFMB-TV Channel 8.

ETERNAL'S POP-SOUL FLAME BURNS DOWN A BARRIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How's this for rare? 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, interracial groups are scarce in pop music, but within this 
category, there are hardly any mixed female vocal groups. Narrowing it down a 
bit more, there have only been a handful of major female vocal groups ever to 
come out of the U.K. So imagine how rare an interracial British female vocal 
group is. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to Eternal, a pop-soul quartet featuring one white, Louise 
Nurding, and three blacks -- Kelle Bryan and sisters Easther and Vernette 
Bennett. The group, ages 19 to 22, has hits both in Britain and the United 
States, where "Stay" made the pop Top 20. It's the first single from the 
group's new debut album, "Always & Forever," on EMI/ERG Records. 
</P>
<P>
 In town recently for a TV guest spot, Nurding and Bryan, relaxing in a 
Hollywood restaurant before heading to rehearsal, tried to explain why you 
hardly see any groups like theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Singers might avoid getting in a group like this because they don't think it 
would get anywhere," Nurding explains. "They know some people don't like to see 
blacks and whites in the same group and they don't want the hassles." 
</P>
<P>
 But, she adds, a group like Eternal can thrive because, when it comes to 
music, the majority of the fans are color blind. 
</P>
<P>
 "They listen to music and buy it based on what it sounds like," she says. 
"With new groups like ours, people usually hear the music before they ever see 
the group. Do you think they'd change their opinion if they find out a group is 
interracial? Of course not." 
</P>
<P>
 The racial aspect of the group gets much more focus in the United States, 
partly because of the way radio is segmented. "In England, all stations play a 
variety of music," Bryan explains. "The style of the music or the color of the 
artist doesn't matter. But in the U.S., radio is much more in categories. When 
you're starting out like we are, if you're black you're played on black 
stations for the most part. Your color is part of the way you're categorized." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The interracial factor could have been a drawback in American radio. Eternal's 
soul music normally would be funneled to black stations but the presence of a 
white member might make some program directors shy away from the group, 
figuring their listeners wouldn't like it. On the other hand, the racial makeup 
might broaden the group's appeal and make pop radio acceptance -- the goal of 
all artists -- easier. This is what Eternal's manager, Dennis Ingoldsby, had in 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "The record has crossed into both soul and pop markets in the U.S.," he points 
out in a separate interview. "Having a white singer really helped people see 
the pop aspects of this group." 
</P>
<P>
 A white member also erased a potential comparison he felt might limit the 
group. "I didn't want people to say 'There's another En Vogue' and dismiss them 
as a copy before they even heard them," he says. "I wanted a group something 
like En Vogue but distinctive. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "People will naturally ask, 'Why is there someone white in the group?' We get 
attention because of that. But Louise has a good soul voice. She's not in the 
group just because she's white." 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't there something cold and calculating about all this? 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure there is somewhat, but that's the nature of the business," the manager, 
who is white, replies. "It helps to have something distinctive to market. What 
would make this bad is if they couldn't sing and they hated each other and they 
were together just to make money. But they can all sing very well and they get 
along very well together." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not just managerial hype. They really can sing -- as well as or better 
than some American hit-making groups. Eternal lead vocalist Easther Bennett is 
exceptional, with considerable range and, due at least in part to a gospel 
background, remarkable emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Ingoldsby's claim that the four are close friends, Nurding 
enthusiastically confirms it. "This wouldn't work any other way," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurding was the first member recruited by Ingoldsby when he formed the group 
three years ago in London. Next, he discovered the Bennett sisters singing in a 
club. Later on, Nurding brought in Bryan, who had been her classmate at a 
performing arts school. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Nurding and Bryan stressed the importance of Eternal's chemistry. It 
wasn't there at first. "Before Kelle, there was another singer, but we didn't 
click with her and she didn't click with us," Nurding explains. "But we got 
Kelle and she fit in." 
</P>
<P>
 They had a year before the album was recorded to get well-acquainted. "We got 
to know each other and got to know our roles in the group," Bryan says. "When 
you don't get along you can often hear it in the singing, or the record doesn't 
even get made because of the hostilities. But with us, we were sure the 
chemistry was finally right."

TRUE TO HIS FRIGHTFUL VISIONS; GUILLERMO DEL TORO BRINGS A MEXICAN PERSPECTIVE 
TO HORROR FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANA S. PARDO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Guillermo del Toro's passion for horror movies began at the age of 4, when he 
made a deal with the monsters that haunted him through the night: He would 
become their best friend if they would let him go to the bathroom in peace. Two 
years later he began collecting his first horror-genre videos; at 8 he made his 
first home movie, and at 28 his first feature. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cronos," a film that Del Toro says is a cross between a classic horror film 
and a melodrama, has already been widely honored in Del Toro's native Mexico 
and abroad. In Guadalajara, Del Toro's hometown, the film grossed three times 
what "The Fugitive" did; in Mexico City, the film received nine Ariel awards 
last year, the highest honor in Mexican film, and was Mexico's official entry 
to the best foreign film category of the 1993 Academy Awards; it won the 
Critics' Week competition at last year's Cannes Film Festival and is being 
distributed in the United States by October Films, opening Friday at selected 
theaters in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Toro, who is now 29, studied screenwriting with veteran director Jaime 
Humberto Hermosillo, known for such films as "Dona Herlinda and Her Son," and 
"The Homework," and learned the craft of makeup and special effects in New York 
with Oscar winner Dick Smith. At present, Del Toro is director of the 
production department at the University of Guadalajara, one of the most 
important film schools in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cronos," its director says somewhat cryptically, "is an irreverent love 
letter written with a great deal of affection." It takes place in 1997, in a 
"non-futuristic NAFTA Mexico," Del Toro says, and tells the story of an 
antiques dealer who discovers an object created by a 16th-Century alchemist 
from Veracruz. The device gives eternal life to its owner but with one 
stipulation: He or she must feed on human blood.  
</P>
<P>
 The film gradually -- and creepily -- reveals the secrets of this fantastic 
device and how it affects the lives of those who encounter it: the antiques 
dealer, played by Argentine actor Federico Luppi; his wife (Margarita Isabel) 
and their 5-year-old granddaughter (Tamara Shanath). Others desperate to get 
their hands on the device include American actor Ron Perlman in the role of 
Angel de la Guardia, and his uncle, businessman Dieter de la Guardia, played by 
Claudio Brook. Dieter, who is terminally ill, has in his possession the diary 
of the alchemist, which includes detailed instructions of the use of the 
device, and will stop at nothing to get it. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Toro believes his picture breaks with the traditional structure of old 
Mexican horror films. For one thing, he says, the villains are American and 
speak English; the heroes are Latino and speak Spanish. And while he enjoys 
working in Hollywood, this perspective is not a surprise; Del Toro prefers a 
distinctively Latino viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with making movies in the U.S. is always creative: The stories 
repeat themselves again and again," he says. "In Mexico none of the films of 
recent years resemble one another. Our only problem is finding the money to 
shoot."  
</P>
<P>
 "Cronos" is the second most expensive Mexican film ever, after "Like Water for 
Chocolate," with a budget of $2 million. Its nine-week schedule was 
considerably longer than that of the average Mexican movie; extensive special 
effects as well as foreign actors, like Luppi and Perlman, added to the budget 
of the film, which was made in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 Raising the money for this project was the work of producer Berta Navarro, who 
from the beginning was convinced that the film needed to be an international 
co-production with an eye toward a high profile outside Mexico. Navarro has a 
great deal of experience in Mexican film: Her first production was the drama 
"Reed: Mexico Insurgente," based on American journalist John Reed's book about 
covering the Mexican Revolution, directed by Paul Leduc, and she has gone on to 
produce many Mexican and American projects, including 1992's "Cabeza de Vaca." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Navarro believes film in Mexico is restructuring itself. "Our movies are 
playing around the world," she says, "and although we still don't have a 
consolidated film industry, this doesn't mean we will not have one in the near 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 Principal photography began in February, 1992, and, after post-production in 
Los Angeles, the film was finished by September. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Toro specifically acknowledges the film's cinematographer, Guillermo 
Navarro, also known for his work in "Love Around the Corner," "Cabeza de Vaca" 
and more recently "The Cisco Kid," directed by Luis Valdez for TNT. Brigitte 
Broch was the art director; the original score, filled with polkas, cumbias and 
tangos, was composed by Javier Alvarez. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Toro claims that, unlike other Mexican filmmakers who have relocated to 
Los Angeles, his interest in Hollywood is merely part of his learning 
experience. And although his movies may have international appeal, they also 
have "a very Latin American vision. . . . I am interested in making movies here 
in Los Angeles, but, of course, that's what airplanes are for. I always want to 
return home because my heart and my people are there." 
</P>
<P>
 Del Toro is now in Mexico preparing "The Devil's Backbone," a drama, and is 
developing a project for the American market, "Meat Market: A Love Story," 
about an employee of a butcher shop who falls in love with his boss's wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the works is a joint project with directors Dana Rotberg ("Angel of 
Fire") and Alfonso Cuaron ("Love in the Time of Hysteria"), exploring the theme 
of Mexico's Day of the Dead.

 An independent British comedy that has been gradually adding theaters 
unceremoniously pushed aside a new suitor starring Chevy Chase and Jack Palance 
to lead the box-office procession. But, overall, filing tax returns apparently 
did not put the public in a film-going mood, and attendance dipped to its 
lowest point in nearly a year.Other new entries, including "White Fang 2," the 
sequel to a popular 1991 film, also failed to catch on.

SOUTH AFRICA: FORGING A NATION; SOUTH AFRICA: A TALE OF SIX FAMILIES; THE 
NATION RISES FROM APARTHEID

 Nothing sums up apartheid more precisely, nor more painfully, than a black 
mother crying for her child killed in the dusty streets of a South African 
township in a protest against a system that was denying him a future. 
</P>
<P>
 Down through the years, images of white oppression and black struggle seared 
themselves into the world's conscience -- police firing upon black protestors, 
bulldozers leveling shacks that black families called home, mobs burning 
suspected collaborators alive, priests leading prayers for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 When the late Nobel Laureate Alan Paton titled his emblematic novel of South 
Africa "Cry the Beloved Country," he caught all the contradictory emotions of a 
land where hope and doom seemed sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, with almost miraculous resilience, South Africa is moving toward its 
first free elections next week -- a poll in which more than 22 million people 
of all races will be eligible to vote, ending nearly 350 years of 
white-minority rule. To tell this story of dramatic change, The Times went to 
the people lived it, the families from every quarter of South African society, 
in every corner of the country. This is their testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was will no longer be," said Mary Mosala, a community leader in the 
black Johannesburg township of Alexandra, trying to sum up the enormity of the 
changes. "But what will be, no one knows -- that is up to us, all of us."

 In 1948, South Africa began imposing an unparalleled system to segregate the 
races and ensure the political supremacy of the white minority.Known as 
apartheid , from Afrikaans for "separateness," it divided South Africans into 
white, black, Colored (mixed race) and Indian. It restricted where nonwhites 
could live, work, play and go to school. Blacks had no vote.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: CHEROKEE REPORTS LOSS OF $3.88 MILLION FOR PERIOD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cherokee Inc., a Sunland-based maker of women's clothes and shoes, reported a 
fiscal third-quarter loss of $3.88 million on a 44% decline in sales from a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss in the quarter ended Feb. 26 was about the same as that of a year 
earlier. But revenue in the latest quarter plummeted to $24.7 million, from 
$44.4 million a year earlier, partly because the company has been 
restructuring. Its new line of clothes will be shipped in June. 
</P>
<P>
 For the nine months ended Feb. 26, Cherokee posted a loss of $8.52 million, 
compared with a loss of $13.2 million a year earlier. Sales for the latest nine 
months totaled $84.8 million, down 28% from $117.6 million.

 Dole Food Co., a Westlake Village food and real estate concern, reported that 
its first-quarter net income dropped 44% from a year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three months ended March 26, Dole earned $29.7 million, in contrast 
with a $53.3-million profit in the first quarter of 1993. But a year earlier it 
had a $30.9-million one-time gain from its real estate subsidiary's stock sale. 
Its revenue in the latest quarter rose 7%, to $818.8 million from $766.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said that the market for bananas, one of its biggest products, 
improved in the first quarter as it continued to reduce its costs, but lower 
prices for lettuce, celery and canned pineapple and concentrate reduced its 
overall results.

SOUTH AFRICA: FORGING A NATION; SOUTH AFRICA: A TALE OF SIX FAMILIES; CHAPTER 
ONE / WHAT WAS APARTHEID? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Apartheid crushes you, it squeezes the life out of you, it leaves you broken 
before the end of your years," Shirley Mofokeng said with a sigh that shook her 
whole body. "Simply to live under apartheid has been a day-by-day, even 
hour-by-hour, struggle for us all." 
</P>
<P>
 A hush quickly fell over the Mofokengs' small living room in Soweto, the huge 
black city outside Johannesburg, for Shirley Mofokeng was talking about the 
death of her husband, Abner, six years ago at the age of 51 from what she 
simply called "a weakened heart." 
</P>
<P>
 "Apartheid killed my father," her son, Tebogo Mofokeng, 28, a high school 
science teacher, agreed. "He wasn't shot down in the street as so many were, he 
wasn't starved to death in one of those (rural, tribal) homelands, but he was 
worked to death and worried to death and hated to death by this system." 
</P>
<P>
 For South Africa's black majority, apartheid meant much more than racial 
separation, more even than the entrenchment of minority white rule over the 
country and its economy. Since its imposition by the Afrikaner-led National 
Party in 1948, apartheid systematically stripped millions of people of their 
human dignity, treating them as cheap labor and banishing them from wherever 
they were not needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Every South African black has an experience with apartheid horrors -- being 
driven from home, deprived of an education, humiliated by segregationist rules 
and discriminated against at every turn, jailed for trying to find a 
better-paying city job, burying a child killed by police -- but for most, the 
daily dehumanization exacted the highest toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apartheid was felt every day," Tebogo Mofokeng said. "It tore at us 
emotionally, psychologically and physically. A mother goes to work and comes 
home angry after being pushed around by whites all day. Her children feel that 
anger. A father is worked to death in the only job the regime will let him 
have, and his family is left to cope however it can. Children are dumped out of 
school uneducated and stupid. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The traumas from which most societies, including white South Africa, try to 
protect its members," he added, "apartheid methodically, even deliberately, 
inflicted upon us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mofokengs' struggle to survive as a family is the story of South Africa's 
35.8 million blacks, mixed-race Coloreds and Asians whose rights and very 
humanity apartheid had denied. 
</P>
<P>
 That struggle, multiplied across a rich and varied land and intensified from 
one generation to the next, finally brought an end to what the oppressed had 
damned as "The System" -- the almost absolute control that the 5.2 million 
whites, particularly the politically dominant Afrikaners, had built over the 
centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in the front room of their matchbox house in Soweto's Meadowlands 
neighborhood, their home for nearly 20 years, the Mofokengs -- Shirley, Tebogo, 
Audrey, Nathaniel and Patience -- were equally philosophical and political as 
they discussed the end of apartheid and more humorous than bitter as they 
recalled their own experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had two toilets where I was working -- one for the white baas , the other 
for the black workers," Shirley Mofokeng said, recalling her years as a 
seamstress and shop steward in clothing factories. "With so many of us on the 
shop floor, this was a problem, and so one day I said, 'You know, you won't get 
painted black sitting where I sat.' He got the point. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "People with power don't want to share -- maybe that's a rule of life for some 
-- and these whites, particularly the Afrikaners, were quite happy dictating to 
the rest of us. 'Live here, work there, do this, don't do that.' Well, it 
didn't last, and it couldn't last." 
</P>
<P>
 After the death of her husband, a supervisor at the bus company that ferried 
black workers back and forth to their jobs in Johannesburg, Shirley Mofokeng, 
51, struggled to keep her children in school, working long hours as a 
seamstress at clothing factories before becoming a factory supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the second-eldest of seven children, I had to drop out (in the 10th grade) 
to help out my parents, but I didn't want that to happen to my children," she 
said. "With just one salary, it was very tough. I was lucky that I had kids who 
understood that dinner some nights would be just tea and bread without butter. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get paid on Friday, and after the rent, the electricity, medicine, school 
fees, the phone and clothes, you're lucky if there's enough money for food. 
These kids know what it's like not just to go to bed hungry but go off to 
school hungry too." 
</P>
<P>
 Tebogo recalls doing his homework by candlelight when there was no electricity 
at home, bundling against the cold winter winds when broken windows were not 
replaced in his classroom and organizing study groups in his senior year of 
high school when there were no science teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to become a doctor, and I had the marks," he said. "But all the 
quotas were full. 'No, boy, we have enough black doctors,' they said, and that 
was that. So I became a teacher, though I have not lost my ambition to become a 
doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pushing her children all the way was Shirley Mofokeng, who retains the energy 
and zest that made her a regional tennis champion in her youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The schools might have been closed, but my kids still studied," she recalled. 
"I drew up a plan, and every day they would bring their notebooks to show me 
what they did that day. And, just like I learned in management courses, I 
followed up. Oh, I was strict, but I didn't want them to stop where I had to." 
</P>
<P>
 Tebogo, who was christened Churchill but now uses his African name, finished 
his science degree at the University of the North, a college for blacks at 
Turfloop, and teaches science, mathematics and English in Soweto, giving 
students extra classes for additional income. 
</P>
<P>
 Patience Mofokeng, 30, the eldest of the four Mofokeng children, became an 
organizer for a retail clerks union and lives in the heavily industrialized 
East Rand outside Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Audrey, 21, is preparing to enroll in a marketing course later this year at a 
technical college. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathaniel, 17, the youngest, is in high school with ambitions for university, 
though civil unrest and repeated school closures have cost him a couple of 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are now three grandchildren on whom Shirley Mofokeng dotes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mother is a real 'township mama,' and these township mamas are tough, 
tough, tough," Audrey said, gently teasing her mother. "They are what hold our 
families together and what hold our communities together. . . . The real 
resistance to apartheid, I think, came from families, even before it came from 
organizations like the African National Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Mofokeng agreed. "The struggle against apartheid began with the 
struggle to live," she said. "At work, I'd see the white baas sitting in his 
office all day, doing little but drinking coffee, working short hours and 
getting a nice salary while we worked hard down on the factory floor. You ask 
yourself why, and the answer is that he is a white man. 
</P>
<P>
 "And then there were the things outside work. The nastiness at the 
(white-owned) cafes, the insults from officials and policemen that make you 
sick, the worry about your kids, the I-don't-care attitude of doctors when your 
husband is dying, the terrible lack of basic services in Soweto." 
</P>
<P>
 A trade union shop steward for 10 years, Shirley Mofokeng became active in 
community affairs in recent years. She works in the Soweto Civic Assn.'s 
housing and health care committees and, as its education officer in 
Meadowlands, organizing seminars to explain the political changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every night, it's a meeting," she said. "But I had to get involved for the 
simple reason that I don't keep quiet if there is something that is not right. 
That is the only way we are going to fix things. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are talking now to these guys who have been running things in Soweto their 
way for years, and they are hearing about what they have been doing to us. They 
are afraid, I tell you they are afraid, but fortunate for them we are not 
vengeful." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as it disappears, however, apartheid leaves a legacy certain to mark 
South Africans for many years, Tebogo said, explaining how he was sending his 
son, Setjhaba, 4, to a racially integrated nursery school to prepare him for 
the "new South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 "Although black people are becoming aware of themselves as human beings, it 
will take time to change our psychology and even longer to change that of the 
whites," he said. "We had this system for years, and it will take years to get 
rid of it. Even now when I see a white, I see someone who is thinking how 
stupid I am, how insignificant I am. This affects me. But our children will be 
different, and their children will be truly free." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is probably no greater indictment of apartheid and its preservation of 
power and privileges for whites -- and no clearer explanation of the decades of 
tough black resistance -- than what it did, routinely and brutally, to black 
families, ordinary black families such as the Mofokengs. White prosperity and 
well-being were ensured through black poverty and deprivation. 
</P>
<P>
 Different from the segregation and discrimination suffered by U.S. blacks, 
apartheid was intended to enhance the political and economic power of South 
Africa's white minority, particularly the 3 million Afrikaners, whose Dutch, 
German and French Huguenot forebears first settled here in the 17th Century, 
and its instruments were totalitarian rule and open oppression. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, two-thirds of the country's blacks continue to survive on less than 
what government and independent economists consider a basic subsistence income, 
and more than a quarter of them are "completely destitute." The average white 
family has an income six times that of an African family; despite widespread 
unionization in industry, whites still earn about 3.6 times what blacks do on 
factory floors. 
</P>
<P>
 Decades-old policies, moreover, promoted structural unemployment to ensure 
large pools of cheap black labor. Out of a total labor pool of 14 million, 
South Africa has about 5.4 million unemployed -- the vast majority of them 
blacks. Only 3% to 4% of new job seekers find employment, according to labor 
economists, and the number of those without work grows at more than 400,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Generations of black youth were deprived of an adequate education. Of the 2% 
of African students who finish all 12 years of schooling today, only 41% pass 
their matriculation exams, compared to 96% of whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Student-teacher ratios at African schools remain more than 40 to 1, compared 
to 16 to 1 at the previously whites-only schools; white teachers, moreover, are 
better qualified than those in black schools, most of whom emerged from the 
same educational system and lack university degrees and professional training. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although virtually any measure illustrates the advantages enjoyed by whites 
through their determined hold on political and economic power, comparative 
statistics on health are particularly telling. Whites have a life expectancy of 
73 years, blacks 61 -- and in rural areas 48. Black African infant mortality, 
another key health indicator, is 65 per 1,000 live births, more than seven 
times that among white babies. Tuberculosis, a disease typical among the 
impoverished, has risen 41% in the last five years among blacks. Overall, the 
TB rate is one of the highest in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the government spent four or five times as much on health care for 
whites as for blacks so that, before the hospitals were desegregated two years 
ago, there were four hospital beds for every 1,000 blacks, most of them at 110% 
occupancy, while for whites there were more than eight beds per 1,000, with 
occupancy little more than 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the country's political transformation, little has changed since the 
Second Carnegie Inquiry into Poverty and Development in Southern Africa wrote 
in a landmark study in 1989: 
</P>
<P>
 "Thousands of South African babies are dying of malnutrition and associated 
diseases. Two million children are growing up stunted for lack of sufficient 
calories in one of the few countries in the world that exports food. Tens of 
thousands of men are spending their entire working years as 'labor units' in 
single-sex hostels whilst their wives and children live generally in great 
poverty in the overcrowded (rural, tribal) reserves." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the grinding daily tragedy of apartheid there was also the absurdity of 
social engineering gone mad as the government tried to divide the black 
population into 10 separate African nations, of which the 8.5 million Zulus 
were the largest; seven classifications of mixed-race Coloreds, ranging from 
"Cape Malay" to "Colored-other," and Asians descended from immigrant Indian 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Manu Desai, wanting to escape the rigid racial segregation of Durban, moved 
about 25 years ago to Cape Town, a city where different races had historically 
mixed more easily and where authorities were more relaxed in enforcing the 
rules of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 "That made me a criminal," Desai said, recalling old laws prohibiting Indians 
from leaving Natal province. "There was nothing for me in Durban; I wanted to 
start a business but I couldn't. The government barred Indians from most 
fields, and whites had monopolies we couldn't challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not that we couldn't better ourselves, but that we were not allowed 
to. Only 200 Indians were accepted a year for (high school graduation) at that 
time, and if you didn't make it, then your life was on the factory floor or 
behind the shop counter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all locked in our own 'population groups,' and breaking free was very 
difficult. Indians lived with Indians, whites with whites, Coloreds with 
Coloreds, Africans with Africans. We went to different schools, we played on 
different sports fields, we shopped in different stores, we traveled in 
different buses, we ate in different restaurants. In my father's day, it was 
even worse; he could not walk on the pavement if a white was there." 
</P>
<P>
 Desai, who is 54, established a small printing business in the Woodstock area 
of Cape Town, and today, working from two shops across the road from one 
another, he prints everything from guarantee cards for electronics products to 
posters for boxing matches to educational materials on AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some weeks, we are here every day, and some days we work 16 or 18 hours," he 
said as he checked the quality of some freshly printed election flyers. "I 
can't say that business is bad -- we're doing quite OK." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Desai's escape from apartheid, however, was only partial. He married a woman, 
Minnie, now his wife of 21 years, who was classified as a "Cape Colored," a 
person of mixed race by government definition. And that trapped them in a maze 
of apartheid regulations that, while repealed, still bind them in strange ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Desai quickly found that he and his wife had to live in an area designated for 
Indians, although housing there was scarce and expensive and they preferred to 
live in a Colored area because of better amenities. So they divorced -- on 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an Indian, I couldn't own a house in a Colored area, and as a married 
woman, Minnie couldn't own a house anywhere," Desai said. "Technically, 
legally, we had to divorce in order to live together where we wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dropped Minnie off at the lawyer's office one day to do the divorce, I 
called on a couple of customers and I picked her up half an hour later. I 
considered that we had bought a piece of paper called a 'divorce decree,' and 
that was all. Minnie bought the house, I became her 'lodger,' and we carried on 
with our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The Desais, who now have three daughters -- Leila and Pravina, 19, twins who 
are studying business administration, and Sarita, 6 -- continued to exploit the 
loopholes of apartheid as the system sagged under the absurdity of its own 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, when the Desais wanted to move to East Rondebosch, a suburb of 
middle-class whites north of Cape Town, they formed a company with a white 
friend as the nominal owner that then bought the comfortable, three-bedroom 
house and "assigned" Manu and Minnie Desai to reside there as company 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 East Rondebosch is now fully integrated, and Minnie Desai describes most of 
her neighbors as "warm and welcoming, very kind people, not at all racist." 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we make a decent living, we could find ways around many apartheid 
regulations, but it cost us thousands," Manu Desai said. Although a businessman 
more focused on profits than politics, he became caught up in the popular 
struggle against apartheid in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't carry guns, but we helped force this change," he said. "The 
business community gave financial support, and I printed a lot of stuff the 
regime could have hanged me for. Whew, some of the manifestos were so hot that 
just holding them burned my hands! 
</P>
<P>
 "There were raids one after another in those days, and often we printed 
through the night while the police slept. Thank God, I wasn't caught -- it 
would have been the end of the business, the end for my family, maybe even the 
end of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Sobered by that recollection, Desai continued: "Under apartheid, there were no 
two kinds of black. Black was black, and we all suffered terrible injustices. . 
. . Still, one must ask, 'What about those who could not buy their way out of 
petty apartheid -- not that we really succeeded -- for they numbered in the 
tens of millions?' 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, there is another question: What about the waste all this entailed? 
Sixty percent of government funds have been wasted on apartheid over the past 
45 years, on checking to see who was marrying whom and preserving the racial 
purity of the Afrikaner people, on putting everyone else in tight little cages 
and on building up the military and the security apparatus to protect a system 
of privileges for the whites. 
</P>
<P>
 "What waste, what waste!" Desai exclaimed, shaking his head as much over the 
folly of apartheid as the pain it inflicted. "Soon we will be out of this mess, 
I hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Desai, whose heavy eyelids hide a very quick mind, counts himself among the 
country's optimists, believing that opening the economy fully to blacks, the 
massive development program planned by the ANC and further measures, such as 
the distribution of unfarmed land, will create the jobs that will in turn bring 
social stability. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a family has a roof over its head and food on the table, its whole 
perspective changes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other element is schooling. From one generation to the next, it will be 
education that improves the quality of life. Look, I have enough work to take 
on several more people, but there aren't qualified guys because many 
apprenticeships were closed to blacks." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Desais' two elder daughters, Leila and Pravina, virtually luxuriate in the 
challenge of their business administration courses at the University of the 
Western Cape, ignoring the campus's intense leftist politics to concentrate on 
their studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five years ago, everything was politics, and the politics were radical," 
Leila Desai said. "Today, there are many of us who go to school to learn and 
learn all we can; the struggle has basically been won, and it is up to us to 
take full advantage of the opportunities we have as a result of that struggle."

STAFF INCENTIVES SPARK PROFITS AT POWER-ONE; CAMARILLO: POWER SUPPLY FIRM'S 
EARNINGS SURGED 50% LAST YEAR, LARGELY BECAUSE OF BONUSES FOR IMPROVING PRODUCT 
QUALITY AND CUTTING COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Rachel Benavides, the travel coordinator at Power-One Inc., knew the power 
supply company's new bonus plan was catching on last year when salesmen started 
asking her to buy them super-discount airline tickets for business trips. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted the deals where you have to stay over on Saturday night," she 
recalls. "That's how you get the cheapest seats and hotel rooms." For the 
inconvenience, Power-One's sales people were cutting their department's costs 
and helped achieve one of the incentive program's main goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 200 employees at the firm's Camarillo headquarters plant now say 
they were inspired by the chance for extra money but were also spurred on by 
the goals themselves. The bonus program, introduced companywide in January, 
1993, set such goals as improving product quality, cutting costs and speeding 
up the introduction of new products. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, on March 17 of this year, the plan's architect, Chief Executive Steve 
Goldman, announced the results. Power-One's initial incentive plan was a big 
success. Company sales rose 8% last year to $51 million, and more importantly, 
employees reduced costs so effectively that profits skyrocketed almost 50%, to 
$2 million. Goldman, 36, calculates that the incentive plan added $750,000 to 
Power-One's profits last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Goldman passed out checks totaling $342,000 to every employee at the 
Camarillo plant -- an average of $1,700 per person, although some employees 
received more than twice as much. That brought the cash rewards received this 
year by Power-One's 1,000 employees at various locations worldwide to $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people say money isn't a motivator, but it is," Goldman says. "We 
came up with a plan that had a specific formula. It showed exactly how much the 
bonus pool would be if certain goals were achieved. . . . People were 
fascinated with what achieving the goals meant to the company and their 
departments." 
</P>
<P>
 Reliability engineering supervisor Dirk Anderson, for instance, found himself 
and others in his department working until midnight as the first year's program 
came down to the wire. "The sooner we solved the problems, the sooner we got 
the units to the customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson and his engineers were trying to reduce the failure rate on the 
complicated devices that Power-One produces to convert AC, or 
alternating-current electricity, to DC, or direct current. By reducing the 
failure rate, the engineers reduced costs and got the products out on or ahead 
of schedule, another bonus plan goal. 
</P>
<P>
 So it went throughout the Camarillo plant. Maggie Nadjmi, in product 
marketing, found herself working extra-hard as a customer-service 
representative. Kevin Gero, a sales engineer who'd worked for AT&T and Compaq 
Computer, was amazed to find himself and everybody else in his department 
thrashing out their own budget. That would be unheard of at his former 
employers, he says. "Practically everybody in the plant had a hand in their 
department's budget." 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies, of course, have tried bonus plans. But when Goldman and his 
aides couldn't find another firm with a plan that was adaptable to relatively 
small, privately held Power-One, they ad-libbed one of their own. A key element 
was the promise that for every dollar saved, the company would contribute 15 
cents to the bonus pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Goldman has a plan for 1994 that ties virtually all company activities to 
the incentive program. "We've developed software that allows anybody in the 
Camarillo plant to push a few buttons on a computer and find out, day to day, 
how each department is doing in relation to its goals." Goldman expects this 
new twist to boost enthusiasm over the bonus plan, and so he's projecting a 50% 
annual growth rate in profits for the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Camarillo, Power-One has plants in Mexico, Puerto Rico and the 
Dominican Republic. And while it's a small company, Power-One's average $1,700 
bonus to the workers at its Camarillo plant exceeded Ford Motor Co.'s average 
bonus this year of $1,350. 
</P>
<P>
 Power-One, whose customers are mainly electronics, industrial and medical 
companies, might have gone on quietly earning a respectable profit and 
gradually carving itself a larger and larger slice of the nation's $6-billion 
power supply market. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, however, people are taking notice -- not only as a result of the 
bonus program, but also because a consortium headed by Power-One was recently 
one of the first groups chosen by the Clinton Administration to develop 
projects aimed at generating new jobs by converting defense know-how to 
commercial uses. 
</P>
<P>
 Power-One and its consortium partners -- including Rockwell International, the 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and GenCorp Inc. -- will seek new uses 
for the aerocapacitor, a high-density storage device that's something like a 
battery. The modest, $1.9-million federal grant project could help develop an 
economically feasible electric car. The assignment is especially appropriate 
for Power-One, which since it was founded in 1973, has refused all military 
work because of its notorious peaks and valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 And Wall Street has renewed efforts to woo the firm into going public or 
listening to takeover offers. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman joined Power-One in 1982, when he was 24. An engineering graduate of 
the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut, he held engineering and 
research-and-development posts until he earned his master's degree in business 
in the late 1980s. After that, he was promoted to chief financial officer, and 
in 1990 he was named chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80% of Power-One's stock is held by its two founders, whom Goldman 
declined to identify. He said the two owners seldom get involved in operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry observers say Power-One is about the 10th-largest producer of power 
supply equipment in the nation and the largest privately held company in the 
field. In almost anything that's powered by electricity -- from a vending 
machine to an automated industrial production line -- you will find a unit made 
by Power-One or one of its rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Power-One has about 500 power supply models in production, for such customers 
as AT&T, Bell Industries, Du Pont, GE Medical, Kodak and Texas Instruments. The 
company shies away from the costly practice of creating new products for 
individual customers -- but its engineers still design 50 new configurations a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 For some customers, however, Power-One gets involved in every stage of 
designing electrical equipment. Power-One is working with the ventilator 
division of Puritan Bennett Corp., based in Carlsbad, to develop a new 
life-support system for heart surgery patients. "They've been supplying our 
power units since 1983," reports Paul Woodring, Puritan's research and 
development manager. "We're pleased with what they do for us." 
</P>
<P>
 At Power-One, no single customer currently accounts for more than 4% of 
revenues. Indeed, to avoid dependence on just one source, the absolute limit 
for a single customer is 10%. "We turned down business from IBM when they were 
getting into personal computers. We were afraid they'd send us too many 
orders," Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 For a conservative company, however, Power-One has become expansive in its 
outlook. Sales grew modestly from $45.9 million in 1991 to $51 million in 1993. 
But for the next three years, Goldman projects a jump in sales to $90 million 
or $100 million by 1996. "That represents internal growth, based on rising 
sales of our current products and some new products. Of course, if we make any 
acquisitions, we'll grow even faster than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman is eager to enter the European market, and the quickest way would be 
by taking over a European company. Power-One, which has no virtually no 
long-term debt, could do a deal through a cash purchase or by going public and 
offering stock, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mohan Mankikar, a Santa Rosa-based electronics industry consultant and 
columnist for the trade newspaper Electronic Engineer Times, questions the 
likelihood of rapid growth by Power-One. "They're a good, stable company with 
good management. But I'm skeptical about projecting as much as $100 million in 
sales by '96," he says. "In view of their (limiting) sales to any single 
customer, which I think is a good policy, I wonder where the new customers and 
new products are going to come from." 
</P>
<P>
 But Goldman has something else going for Power-One that may propel growth -- 
and profits -- even more effectively than new customers and new products: the 
highly successful incentive program. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Maggie Nadjmi, she's just bought a new bedroom set. And Rachel 
Benavides and her family are planning to visit relatives in Guadalajara. The 
furniture and the trip are being paid for by Power-One's bonus plan. 
</P>
<P>
 And just wait till next year, promise Goldman, Nadjmi, Benavides and 
practically everybody else at bonus-happy Power-One.

SOME FIRMS HAVE SHAKEN OFF SLUMP AND THEY'RE HIRING; EMPLOYMENT: COMPANIES 
ADDING WORKERS OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF REASONS, BUT RARELY CITE THOSE COMMONLY 
GIVEN FOR REGION'S RECOVERY -- SUCH AS EARTHQUAKE REPAIRS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For all the talk of economic rebound in Southern California, actually finding 
companies that are hiring is not easy. But a few pockets of recovery are 
emerging. 
</P>
<P>
 At Leadership Management Associates of California, an Agoura Hills consulting 
company, the staff has grown to 31 from nine since the summer. Chief Operating 
Officer James Bond said increased requests from companies for his management 
training services, which among other things focus on ways to boost 
productivity, have tripled LMA's business in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 At Todd C. Olson Estate Brokerage Inc. in Northridge, the first sign that 
times are changing is last week's hire of a recruitment director. Todd Olson 
said his company sold 73 homes in March, up from 65 a year earlier, and expects 
to sell 80 in April. He said home sales in the San Fernando Valley over the 
past two months have encouraged him to hire 25 real estate agents over the next 
three months to add to the 95 he has now. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time I've been in a position to hire in a long, long time," 
Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies that are hiring give a wide range of reasons, but in most cases, 
they do not cite those commonly given for the region's recovery, particularly 
earthquake repairs or quake-related aid. One thing many have in common is a 
growth in their business, often because they've found success in creating new 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chatsworth, Haas Automation Inc. and Fadal Engineering Co. -- competitors 
that make high-precision metal-cutting devices for manufacturers -- in recent 
years have hired dozens of new employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Haas has gone from three employees a decade ago to 200 today, and is still 
hiring for a handful of jobs. Company President Gene Haas said the growth is 
due to increased sales of Haas products, in part because companies "are making 
a choice between capital and human labor," he said. Simply put, Haas' machines 
boost productivity, but not payrolls at the companies that buy them. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen Inc., the Thousand Oaks biotechnology giant, introduced two innovative 
drugs in the past four years and posted a record $383.3-million profit last 
year. Since 1987, its work force has jumped from 344 to more than 3,000, and 
although hiring has slowed, the company may add more than 100 jobs this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Amgen's growth is hardly typical. For most local businesses, the recent 
years have been marked by layoffs, followed by more layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies "are getting to the point that they can't lay off any more," said 
Bond, the Leadership Management Associates official. "They are down to skeletal 
staffs." And so, to remain competitive, companies are turning to firms like 
his, which provides one-on-one training to managers, in hopes of spurring new 
products instead of relying on layoffs, Bond said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles 
County, said financially pinched companies are being driven to find new ways to 
cut costs, producing "an un-traditional recovery" in which new jobs are indeed 
cropping up, but in unexpected places. 
</P>
<P>
 One fast-growing industry in Los Angeles County this year, Kyser said, is 
business services -- which includes consultants, printers and temporary 
services, a trend that may indicate that companies are getting more business 
but are still wary about hiring full-time employees. "Maybe the characteristic 
of this economy is not recovery per se, but new markets emerging," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local employers that are adding workers seem to have a keen sense that they 
are the exception. Nearly all say they are besieged with highly educated, 
experienced applicants, many of whom have been laid off from other jobs. Some 
companies with jobs to fill are so inundated with applicants that they are 
reluctant to say openly that they are hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I literally have a pile on my desk of 700 to 800 applications. And we don't 
advertise," said Dean de Caussin, vice president of management information 
systems and marketing at Fadal, the machine tools company. Fadal has grown to 
280 employees from 207 in the last year, as the company continues to win 
business away from Japanese rivals in the smaller machine tools market. 
</P>
<P>
 "A while back, it was really crazy," de Caussin said. "I would get 10 to 20 
applicants a day who were just walk-ins. . . . Where these people are coming 
from I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be more work to find people. Now it is a lot of work to do the 
screening" of job applicants, LMA's Bond said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laid-off defense workers make up a large portion of the local army of 
job-seekers. Last year, when Litton Industries offered more than 100 new 
positions at its data systems division in Agoura Hills, applicants numbered 
literally in the thousands, said Robert Knapp, Litton public relations 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 The division was hiring thanks to an Army subcontract for a new missile 
detection system, but overall, Litton's Valley-area work force is now 3,200, 
down from about 4,200 in 1990, and is expected to continue to shrink slowly 
this year, Knapp said. The data systems division was able to fill engineering 
jobs that required eight to 12 years of experience almost entirely with local 
people, Knapp said. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called recovery looks even more elusive to those seeking a job. But a 
lucky few have begun to benefit from a change in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since graduating from college four years ago, Jim Blayney, 
28, is working in the profession for which he was trained  
</P>
<P>
 Blayney, who in college learned some technical writing and whose degree is in 
journalism, was just hired as a technical writer at Haas Automation. He had 
struggled for years as a retail clothing and industrial packaging salesman -- 
jobs he never wanted, and pursued only "as a matter of survival," he said. "You 
think maybe this can last awhile, and I'll just make some money." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting a job as a technical writer or journalist in 1990 "was impossible," he 
said. When he finally quit his sales job earlier this year after the company 
asked him to move to San Bernardino, Blayney once again sought a writing job. 
He got the Haas job by answering a want ad in a newspaper, a turn of events he 
considers unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never heard of anything like that, unless it's for someone saying, 'You 
sell our product, and you don't make anything until you sell it,' " said 
Blayney, noting that he saw the same telemarketing and sales jobs advertised in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But it may be a while before most job-seekers will be so lucky. Kyser predicts 
that job growth in Southern California will not really take off until 1995. 
What is being seen now in the Valley and surrounding areas is more like a 
prelude to a full recovery, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But for some employers, the still-dormant economy means growth. 
</P>
<P>
 At JVS Career Transition in Woodland Hills, a nonprofit agency that helps 
counsel job-seekers, the staff has doubled to six in two years as more 
companies retain JVS to help employees they are about to lay off, said Claudia 
Finkel, director of outplacement services. 
</P>
<P>
 Finkel's agency exemplifies the irony of the current job market. JVS gives 
soon-to-be-laid-off workers help with job-hunting skills and, if they can't 
find work, counsels them to consider techniques for becoming self-employed.

<P>
 When Peter Jacobs enrolled at the University of the Western Cape a decade ago 
as a prospective teacher, he was already deep into the struggle against 
apartheid -- deeper than even he realized. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs, now 28, had helped organize the Cape Youth Congress and the local 
branch of the radical Congress of South African Students; he was reading 
smuggled material from the outlawed African National Congress and South African 
Communist Party, and he was in touch with underground members of the ANC and 
its military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation). 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hyperactive," Jacobs said, recalling the tide of campaigns then being 
waged by Colored youths against the minority white regime in Cape Town. "I was 
involved in everything from the boycott of the Colored elections for Parliament 
to local strikes to the rally for Sen. (Edward M.) Kennedy. When I was 
approached to join the underground myself, it made sense politically. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a point at which you can't go any further, when organizing 
demonstrations and rallies does not make sense when the regime is shooting 
people and detaining activists and attacking from all sides. That's when you 
want to do more -- when you want to pick up a gun and shoot back." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs became the political commissar of an ANC guerrilla unit in Mitchell's 
Plain, the sprawling Colored town on the Cape Peninsula, recruiting other 
activists and planning a series of minor attacks -- a grenade attack on a 
policeman's home, bombs in police stations and magistrate's courts, demolition 
of towers for electrical lines -- meant to show the ANC's presence there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peter had grown up angry," his mother, Patricia, recalled. "He had been 
tear-gassed a lot as a small boy and chased by police. He knew how the 
government had taken away my parents' home and given it to whites. He had seen 
how we were moved here -- when there were no schools, no parks, nothing to make 
this place livable. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I was still surprised -- shocked really -- when police raided the house 
and said Peter was a member of the ANC. We had argued a lot about politics, 
almost every day in fact, and the question was not whether to change things, 
but how. I told him apartheid was like a weed and that breaking off leaves one 
by one was not enough -- that its roots had to be pulled out." 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few steps ahead of the security police, Peter Jacobs fled the country, 
missing his sister's wedding.  
</P>
<P>
 Making his way to Mozambique, Jacobs formally joined Umkhonto we Sizwe. "We 
got a lot of training on urban guerrilla tactics, improvising weapons and 
operating underground," he said. "We came back with instructions to lead the 
campaign to make the country ungovernable and to push it toward a full 
insurrection." 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested six months later, in May, 1987, while waiting for one of his 
underground contacts, and held under emergency regulations. Seven months after 
that, he was charged with terrorism along with 20 other members of the ANC and, 
after a yearlong trial, was sentenced to 14 years on Robben Island, South 
Africa's notorious penal colony off Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
 With his initial detention began the amazing radicalization of Patricia 
Jacobs, now 66, who had just retired after working 19 years in Cape Town 
clothing factories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had always tried to look at things from a Christian point of view," she 
said. "I believed that reforms would come, I was against violence, I thought 
the law was wrong but could be changed, I thought the ANC was too radical. . . 
. As I sat in court day after day, I came to understand what motivated them. To 
me, it became absolutely clear that it was right to resist." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To the surprise of her family and friends, Patricia -- still a Sunday school 
teacher in the conservative Colored branch of the Dutch Reformed Church -- 
became a leader in parents' protests over the imprisonment of their sons and 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle had been under way, handed from one generation to the next, 
virtually since European settlers pushed inland from the Cape of Good Hope in 
the 17th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Cape, the Dutch, German and French Huguenot settlers -- who became 
Africa's "white tribe," the Afrikaners -- and later the English came into 
conflict with the indigenous San (or "Bushmen") and Khoikhoi ("Hottentots") 
peoples and farther north with Bantu-speaking Africans who had moved south from 
Central Africa into regions now known as Transvaal, the Orange Free State, 
Natal and the Eastern Cape. 
</P>
<P>
 After the British captured the Cape Colony from the Dutch, they fought a 
series of border wars with the Xhosas from 1811 to 1878 as settlers expanded 
their holdings and the Africans resisted. The Afrikaners, rejecting British 
rule and trekking farther inland, fought the Zulus, defeating them in 1838. 
Forty years later, the Zulus defeated the British in one epic battle, but they 
were then crushed and Zululand was annexed. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1913, three years after the Union of South Africa was established after the 
Anglo-Boer War, the white Parliament limited Africans, then 70% of the 
population, to land in tribal reserves equal to 7% of the country's territory; 
later, the reserves were increased to 13.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 For South Africans, both blacks and whites, the fundamental question thus has 
long been: Whose land is this? 
</P>
<P>
 Under apartheid, the white regime asserted that modern South Africa really 
belonged to those, first of all the Afrikaners, who had developed it, and it 
insisted that most black Africans should "return" to tribal homelands, such 
places as Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Quaqua or KwaZulu, and develop those areas. 
</P>
<P>
 For blacks, the repeated seizure of their land over the centuries was the 
crucial issue, for without the land not only were they reduced to penury, but 
their society, culture and political system were threatened with extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sentiment remains strong among many blacks, particularly supporters of the Pan 
Africanist Congress of Azania, that until the land is reclaimed and an African 
government installed in power, black grievances cannot be redressed. 
</P>
<P>
 The African National Congress, though founded in 1912 to represent the African 
majority and battle racial discrimination, came to the view in its 1955 Freedom 
Charter that "South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white" and 
that "our country will never be prosperous or free until all our people live in 
brotherhood, enjoying equal rights and opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 "The turning point in our struggle came in 1949 -- that's right, 1949," ANC 
Deputy President Walter Sisulu, 82, said, reflecting on the long battle against 
apartheid. "That is when the ANC adopted its action program, and my generation 
-- Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo and others -- dedicated ourselves not just to 
ending apartheid but to achieving democracy for South Africa. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a long tradition of nonviolence in the ANC, but the regime was so 
stubborn that in time -- we waited until 1961 -- we had to take up arms. There 
was no other way forward. We had to believe that we could compel the regime by 
force of arms to change, but we always hoped that the solution would come 
through negotiations. We thought this was a sober policy. Today, we feel 
vindicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Convicted of sabotage and preparing for guerrilla warfare, Sisulu was sent to 
prison for life in 1964 with Mandela and other ANC leaders, and the ANC faded 
into exile, first in London and then in Lusaka, Zambia. Although they trained 
younger men to carry on the struggle, the ANC had been badly hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed time to regroup, reorganize and restructure ourselves," said Max 
Sisulu, 48, eldest of the five Sisulu children, who was freed from detention 
and ordered out of the country by the ANC while his father was on trial. "We 
needed time to recover and to develop a long-term strategy. This was not going 
to be won quickly or easily. It was going to take another generation -- at 
least." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ellen Molekane still remembers that Saturday night date 17 years ago when her 
boyfriend, Mandla Msibi, a Baptist minister advising her youth group in Soweto, 
stopped his car in a secluded spot, got out, opened the trunk and invited her 
to have a look. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were two brand-new AK-47s, absolutely glistening and very, very 
beautiful," she recalled. "That was the first time I had seen anything like 
these rifles. They were exquisite. I knew then that I was in the right 
movement. I was convinced that we could defeat the Boers." 
</P>
<P>
 Working with "Black Man," as the legendary Msibi was known in the ANC 
underground, Molekane helped establish arms caches around Johannesburg and then 
took part in ANC operations, including the assassination in Durban of a 
defector from the ANC's military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, and the shooting of 
another police informer within the movement, also in Durban. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some were really quite sensational military actions, and they helped put the 
ANC back on the political scene," she recalled. "To defeat apartheid, we had to 
convince both the regime and our own people that we could and would fight. We 
had to overcome our sense of powerlessness and total vulnerability and their 
sense of omnipotence and impunity." 
</P>
<P>
 With the police closing in, Molekane and Msibi moved to neighboring Swaziland, 
then to Mozambique and Tanzania, where their son, Tumi, was born in 1979. When 
Msibi died in 1980 in Swaziland, it was believed that he had suffered a heart 
attack. Evidence from government files now suggests that he was poisoned by 
South African agents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Molekane, who is 40 and a senior ANC finance official today, was trained 
in military engineering in East Germany, the German Democratic Republic, served 
in a series of front-line and staff positions in Umkhonto we Sizwe and later 
became secretary of the ANC's key political-military committee in Lusaka, 
Zambia, before returning to South Africa after the ban on the ANC was lifted in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is what leads you into these situations," she said. "I wanted to become 
a nurse or maybe an accountant, but instead I became a soldier. I have asked 
myself why, and the answer I keep coming up with was that it was the only way. 
When I was young, I believed in education, in virtue, in the goodness of people 
-- all those things my mother and father believed in. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got a bit older, I saw that believing was not enough -- we had to act 
ourselves. But what sort of actions? At first, we thought that, if the whole 
(black) nation raised its political consciousness and united and stood up 
against the oppression, this would bring apartheid to an end. When we tried, we 
found that it was not enough simply to demand freedom and justice. This had to 
be fought for and won. It has been a very hard struggle, a struggle of a 
lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 The second of seven Molekane children, Ellen Molekane readily admits that she 
grew up angry -- angry at "The System," angry at whites for creating it, angry 
at blacks for accepting it with a seeming inability to resist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at the older generation, not so much my parents but the generation 
as a whole, and thought: 'What a mess you have left us! How could you just 
accept what these whites dictated? Why didn't you fight? Why didn't you 
struggle to win back our country?' " she recalled, still feisty. "Oh, I was a 
very angry young lady! Our generation, my friends and I decided, would be the 
one that ended this apartheid." 
</P>
<P>
 While she was at Soweto's Morris Isaacson Comprehensive Secondary School, long 
a center of political activism, Molekane had joined the South African Students' 
Movement, many of whose members went on to lead other anti-apartheid groups in 
later years, but she found its Black Consciousness ideology "a long, dark 
tunnel that led nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the era of the Cultural Revolution in China, and we all had little 
Mao Tse-tung books that we read aloud to one another," Molekane reminisced, her 
eyes twinkling with humor. "And then we had this very funny 'black is 
beautiful' stuff from America. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "But our protests, however big and bold we thought they were, would never have 
done it. It took time to realize that the apartheid regime was not going to 
crumble like the walls of Jericho simply because we marched in the streets and 
shouted, 'Down with apartheid!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Watching his sister become involved in politics was a younger brother, Rapu, 
who listened to the older students' debates in the small Molekane house in 
Soweto's Jabavu neighborhood and watched as they planned their protests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The landmark for me was June 16, 1976, and the uprising against Afrikaans as 
the language we were being taught in," Rapu Molekane said, recalling student 
protests that swelled into the first major challenge to apartheid in 15 years. 
"I was only in primary school, but I knew something big was going to happen 
when I saw my sisters' friends making banners out of mealie (cornmeal) sacks in 
the back yard and heard them planning their march. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We younger kids -- I was 15 or 16 -- went to school to start our midyear 
exams that day, but we were summoned from there by older students to a meeting 
protesting Afrikaans. We tore up our exams right there in the classroom and 
marched out." 
</P>
<P>
 For Rapu, who is now 33, it was his first step into what is known among blacks 
as simply "The Struggle." 
</P>
<P>
 "Living in Soweto is what makes people like my family go into politics," Rapu 
Molekane said. "You keep asking questions about why you're nine or 10 or 12 
people in a tiny, four-roomed house with outdoor plumbing, about why you have 
to go to school without shoes, about why the white bosses are working your 
mother and father to death. . . . We weren't born radicals -- life made us this 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Rapu Molekane joined the Congress of South African Students, got training in 
organizational methods from a Catholic-run group, Young Christian Students, and 
used it to help found the Soweto Youth Congress and later the South African 
Youth Congress, becoming its secretary general. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeatedly arrested, frequently tortured and detained without charge under 
emergency regulations for months at a time, Rapu Molekane helped organize the 
United Democratic Front, the main anti-apartheid movement of the 1980s, and 
then joined the ANC's political underground. Released from detention in 1989, 
he slipped out of the country and, infuriating the government, flew to New York 
to address a United Nations committee on political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did a lot of our planning in prison," he recounted. "We took Robben Island 
(where top ANC leaders had been jailed since 1964) as our model, and we debated 
and strategized and planned one campaign after another right there in our 
cells. We were actually expecting the government to put us all in concentration 
camps in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through the various states of emergency in the 1980s, the government was 
detaining more and more people, but that enabled us to get new information, 
send out new directives and think ahead to the next step. We recruited the 
prison warders and had all sorts of political materials smuggled in to us." 
</P>
<P>
 At the ANC's headquarters in Lusaka, Ellen Molekane read of her brother's 
activities, and later they met for the first time in a decade when he came to 
confer with ANC leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "From 1983, I started picking up Rapu's name in intelligence reports, but when 
I got to know how deeply he was involved it was really bad news," she said. "I 
thought it was OK for him to be an activist, but the underground work could 
make things worse for the family. Still, I was proud -- my little brother doing 
such big things." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rapu Molekane was indeed a key figure in the mobilization of millions of black 
youths as the shock force in the ANC's campaign to make South Africa 
ungovernable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were aiming at building the protests into an insurrection and turning that 
into an armed rebellion and then a seizure of power," he recalled. "That 
strategy may look naive today, totally unrealistic and a failure, but we 
developed a momentum that shattered the regime's self-confidence and diminished 
its ability to maintain apartheid. In the end, it was forced into 
negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 As most of the Molekane family gathered for lunch this Easter -- with Ellen 
taking charge of the sausage, the salads, the squash, the rice with peas and a 
dessert of ice cream, custard and fruit cocktail -- there was satisfaction that 
the toughest part of the struggle was over, both for the country and the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 Although worn down by his years of work in a Johannesburg furniture factory, 
Stephen Molekane surveyed the array of children and grandchildren, who now 
number 16, and smiled with tears in the corners of his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a pleasure this family is," he said. "Life has been hard, but this 
family is a wonder." 
</P>
<P>
 That pride is evident in the pictures of Rapu Molekane with ANC President 
Nelson Mandela and his predecessor, Oliver R. Tambo, hanging on the living-room 
wall. When Mandela was released, Rapu worked as his personal assistant. When 
the ANC Youth League was re-established inside South Africa, he was elected its 
secretary general, a post held by Mandela himself four decades earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 And, to complete the reversal of fortunes, Rapu Molekane is now an ANC 
candidate for Parliament and assured of a seat by his rank on the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on a favorite bench in the shade of the house, Stephen Molekane, who 
retired five years ago, spoke quietly of the effort required to raise his 
family through the years of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We first thought apartheid would not last so long," he said, recalling the 
hopes he and his wife, Mary, who died in 1991, had when they first moved to 
Johannesburg in the late 1940s. "We thought the Boers (the Afrikaners) would 
see that this foolishness would not work and would give it up, but they didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we hoped that, at least, if our children got an education then they 
would get ahead despite The System, but that was not possible. When Ellen went 
into exile, it hurt, it really hurt, and when Rapu got involved in politics, 
Mary and I were afraid for his life. Now, I must say these children were right 
-- that apartheid had to be battled. But we were lucky, very lucky they came 
through it all alive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands did die -- more than 20,000 have been killed in political conflict 
in South Africa over the last decade -- for as blacks pressed forward, 
demanding an end to apartheid, whites tightened their grip on power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Above anything else, apartheid was an instrument of political and economic 
power, and no regime yields power willingly," said Zwelakhe Sisulu, 43, the 
third of Walter Sisulu's five children and a major figure in his own right. 
"This regime was more determined than most, even to the point of great 
brutality, to preserve its position." 
</P>
<P>
 Reluctantly, the National Party did retreat in the 1980s from the strictures 
of "petty apartheid" -- the racial segregation that kept whites and blacks 
separate in restaurants and hotels, on buses and trains, in schools and sports 
-- in the hope of satisfying black demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the government responded to requests of businessmen to liberalize other 
laws in the name of economic stability and increased efficiency. Blacks would 
be satisfied, it was believed, with material rather than political concessions 
-- better housing, education and job opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 President Pieter W. Botha went further, backing away from "grand apartheid" to 
bring Indians and Coloreds into his government in 1984, and then to accept a 
permanent but still limited presence of Africans in urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Afrikaners had already moved beyond the embarrassingly crude racial 
concepts of the original apartheid and supported the changes. Apartheid had 
proved unworkable, many believed, and some sort of "power-sharing" with blacks 
would come in time. But more conservative whites, feeling betrayed, began 
leaving the National Party for the far right. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Botha had substituted "security" for apartheid as the dominant political theme 
to mobilize the whites. Increasingly, he relied upon the country's vast 
security Establishment -- the military, the security police, the intelligence 
service -- and pursued a "total strategy" to meet what he saw as a "total 
onslaught" directed against South Africa from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "The essential flaw in their strategy was that we were not directed from 
Moscow -- this was a true liberation struggle, not a revolutionary war," said 
Zwelakhe Sisulu, who was repeatedly detained during the 1980s for his political 
activities but never charged. "Nothing happened at the snap of some Soviet 
commissar's fingers. Everything we did was on the base of what we had done 
before."  
</P>
<P>
 The turning point for Zwelakhe Sisulu, founding editor of the weekly newspaper 
New Nation and now a top executive of the South African Broadcasting Corp., 
came with the emergence of the United Democratic Front, the Congress of South 
African Trade Unions and other groups that focused not on ending apartheid but 
replacing it with democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took years for the people to realize they had to engage in mass struggle 
against the regime and to gain the confidence to do so," he commented. "But 
when they did, they found the government couldn't crush it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next step was to move from ungovernability, which meant that the state 
was not in control but neither were we, to the establishment of democratic 
structures of our own."

 MedGroup expects to boost its shipments overseas this year, after investing 
$1.5 million last year to buy 80% of the rights to the car seats from the 
English company that developed them.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: AEROTEST NEARLY DONE WITH TRANSFER OF OPERATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aerotest Inc., an Irvine aircraft testing and design firm, said it has nearly 
completed the move of its Mojave Airport operations to the Santa Barbara 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The transfer from Mojave, where the company maintained and retrofitted 
transport aircraft, began in December, said Jonathan Bromberg, Aerotest's vice 
president of administration. Aerotest has more than 200 employees at Santa 
Barbara and plans to add more, Bromberg said. Only a few workers remain at 
Mojave, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mojave Airport has gained fame in recent years as one of the world's 
largest storage facilities for idled commercial airplanes. Aerotest performed 
maintenance and repair work on many of the planes stored there. 
</P>
<P>
 Bromberg would not say why Aerotest made the move.

PAC RIM TO ISSUE DEBT SECURITIES, STOCK WARRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pac Rim Holding Corp., a Woodland Hills workers' compensation insurer, said it 
will issue $20 million of convertible debt securities to an investment 
partnership. The company also will issue warrants to purchase 3.8 million 
shares of its common stock to the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership, PRAC Ltd., is controlled by Richard Pickup of Newport Beach, 
who controls 9.9% of Pac Rim's outstanding shares through various investment 
entities. If all the debentures are converted and the warrants exercised, PRAC 
and Pickup would control a majority of Pac Rim's common stock, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pac Rim said about $16.8 million of the proceeds from issuing debt would be 
used to increase the capital of its Pacific Rim Assurance Co. subsidiary. 
Concerns over the company's capital level have resulted in a deterioration of 
its ability to do business since April 1, and Pac Rim expects to report a 
first-quarter operating loss, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement calls for the transaction, which is subject to regulatory and 
stockholder approval, to be completed by June 30. If one party breaches the 
agreement it must pay $1.5 million in liquidated damages, and Pac Rim must pay 
an equal amount if it enters a competing agreement with another investor. 
</P>
<P>
 The convertible debt, or debentures, will carry an 8% interest rate and will 
be due in five years. The debentures are convertible into shares of Pac Rim 
common stock at $2.75 a share. The warrants will allow PRAC to acquire 1.5 
million shares of Pac Rim common stock at an exercise price of $2.50 each, 
another 1.5 million shares at $3 apiece, and 800,000 shares at $3.50 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 PRAC also has an option to buy another $5 million in convertible debentures 
and additional warrants before June 30.

SOUTH AFRICA: FORGING A NATION; SOUTH AFRICA: A TALE OF SIX FAMILIES; WHEN 
CULTURES COLLIDE: A HISTORY OF SOUTH AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The southern tip of the African continent, a territory of high plateaus, 
rolling grasslands and the escarpment of the 10,000-foot Drakensberg Range, is 
a big land, but not big enough for all the peoples who have contended for its 
resources through the centuries. The San were the indigenous people, and early 
immigrants were the pastoral Khoikhoi and the Bantu-speakers from the north. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bartolomeu Dias, a Portuguese navigator, rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 
1488, paving the sea route from Europe to the riches of India, the 
Bantu-speakers were living in what is now Natal province. The first European 
settlers arrived in 1652, setting up a provisioning station for the Dutch East 
India company at the Cape and soon bringing in Malay and East African slaves. 
</P>
<P>
 From that point on, black cultures and white bumped against each other -- and 
white against white and black against black. The collisions, usually violent, 
formed the political turf that produced the coming elections in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 BC: San ("Bushmen") roam area now known as South Africa. 
</P>
<P>

SOUTH AFRICA: FORGING A NATION; SOUTH AFRICA: A TALE OF SIX FAMILIES; CHAPTER 
THREE / THE WHITE RETREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gen. Constand Viljoen, chief of the South African Defense Forces in the early 
1980s and revered as "the soldier's general" for his presence in the hottest 
front lines, watched the growing political struggle with increasing 
disquietude. 
</P>
<P>
 "We warned the government, we warned the politicians, that they had to come to 
a political accommodation," Viljoen recalled, his pale blue eyes hardening as 
he recalled the civilian "vacillation." 
</P>
<P>
 "We in the military and security forces could contain the unrest, we could 
continue detaining people, we could continue shooting people, we could prevent 
the government's violent overthrow," he said, but then added: "I had studied 
revolutionary wars very closely, and I was convinced, and told the government 
so in 1980, that a military solution was not possible. We could buy time, we 
could create security conditions, but that is all we could do." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Viljoen and Defense Minister Magnus Malan, however, the security forces 
grew into what South Africans came to call a "securocracy" -- the National 
Security Management System that paralleled, increasingly directed or even 
supplanted the government at all levels with the aim of matching oppression 
with measures that would "win the hearts and minds" of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With this strategy more than the brute force of earlier years, the regime 
checked the campaign to make the country ungovernable and then turn those areas 
into "liberated zones," as envisioned by some ANC strategists. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Viljoen: "Never was there a possibility, let alone a danger, that the 
government would be overthrown." 
</P>
<P>
 But with equal candor Viljoen acknowledged that the white authorities failed 
to roll back the resistance "to point zero," as they had virtually done in the 
1950s and 1960s, or to win legitimacy for an alternative system of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least five times, we military people called the politicians together and 
told them that the solution lay not with us, but in a settlement that 
accommodated the aspirations, the political aspirations above everything else, 
of all the people of South Africa," Viljoen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some would squirm in their chairs because they didn't like what we were 
telling them; others would nod their heads, but do nothing . . . apartheid was 
dead, and we said, so be it . . . the struggle now was for the future of the 
country, and whether we would have freedom or communism." 
</P>
<P>
 As Constand Viljoen retired to his farm in eastern Transvaal, his twin 
brother, Braam, a theologian in the Dutch Reformed Church, joined liberal 
Afrikaners seeking reconciliation with South Africa's black majority and 
starting negotiations with the ANC on the country's future. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A 1987 meeting between Afrikaner intellectuals, including Braam Viljoen and 
ANC leaders in Dakar, Senegal, helped lay the basis for the unbanning of the 
organization, the release of its imprisoned leaders and ultimately, the new 
political system. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Nelson Mandela was released in February, 1990, I thought, 'Good, this is 
what we have been telling the government to do for 20 years,' " Constand 
Viljoen recalled. "We watched the negotiations between the ANC and the 
government. We did not see a win for the ANC as a loss for us; we thought it 
would be a win-win situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it all fell apart. The government lost the initiative, and it could not 
manage the changes it had set in motion. The South African Communist Party 
virtually took over the negotiations. The National Party collapsed into a 
pitiful, spineless heap. The ANC began to ram socialism down our throats." 
</P>
<P>
 Viljoen, a soldier, a farmer and now a politician, advocates a volkstaat -- a 
homeland within South Africa for those Afrikaners wishing to preserve their way 
of life and culture in tight-knit communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want strong home rule under a central government to protect us from 
communism," Viljoen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a question of race or of superiority; it stems from the principle 
of self-determination. We want to preserve our heritage, to enjoy the benefits 
of a free economy and, above all, to remain a Christian people."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn comes to Louis Botha's farm not with the sharp crack of an electric 
switch but with a gentle roll, the soft, misty light suffusing the fields and 
the woods, turning dark shadows back into cattle and seeping through the 
windows of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a magic time," Botha said. "Even when there is a very heavy day ahead, 
this is a moment to enjoy, just to look around, to be happy to be alive and 
free and to thank God for what he has given us." 
</P>
<P>
 With his brother, Coen, Botha farms 667 acres at Sterkfontein, near the town 
of Amsterdam in eastern Transvaal, but it is a farm that does not, and probably 
cannot, pay its own way. 
</P>
<P>
 The soil is thin and rocky, the acreage less than half what the Bothas need 
for economic viability; modern equipment costs more than the crops will earn at 
the market, and interest rates are so high that a bank loan is the first step 
to foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are sentimental farmers," Louis Botha said as he surveyed a patch of 
sloping ground on which he wants to raise more spinach, beet root and other 
vegetables. "Economically, you have to ask how this makes sense. Yet, it is 
something I really want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Sentiment drew the Botha brothers, both raised in the town of Bethal, where 
their father sold fertilizer and agricultural chemicals, back to the farm where 
their mother, Kotie, now 56, was born. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is something about the Afrikaner that makes him want to be close to the 
land," Louis Botha, 32, said as he drove home from his "city job" as an 
industrial relations manager at a chip board factory 20 miles away in Piet 
Retief. "The Afrikaner feels a strong attachment to the soil. If there is no 
place for me here, there is no place for me anywhere. None of my neighbors 
makes a living farming, but none wants to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Sentiment of quite a different type, however, keeps the Bothas farming. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing is that if we stop farming, we would have to let our black 
farmhands go," Louis Botha said, "and that would be unfair, wrong, something I 
just could not live with. When a man comes and works with you for five or six 
years, you can't just tell them to bugger off, not in these days. Where will he 
find a job? How would his family live?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking the fluent Zulu he learned as a boy and that he has developed with 
further study, Botha greets his foreman, Daniel Nzimande, 55, at 7 a.m. with 
clear affection and respect. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussion is about the weather, the condition of the fields, a sick ox, 
grazing their 100 head of cattle, ploughing more land for the new vegetable 
patch, completing the haymaking, a fence that needs fixing and other tasks for 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Daniel worked for my father, Chris, years and years ago, and when he heard 
that my father was going to come back to farming he quit his job and came to us 
at half the salary, which was all we could afford to pay," Louis Botha said. 
"To my mind, this farm is his as much as ours, and as long as Daniel is with us 
he will have a home for his family and food to eat. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth of it is, we grow these vegetables in order to pay the salaries 
each month, and we are desperate to increase our crop area so we can increase 
their pay." 
</P>
<P>
 For Louis Botha, there has always been an interdependence between whites and 
blacks in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 In rural areas, the links were clear and direct, he said, for the farmer 
needed skilled black workers, and their families lived on his land from 
generation to generation. In the cities, however, the influx of workers from 
the countryside and their confinement in outlying townships turned them into 
low-cost, easily replaced labor, and the relationship became exploitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to romanticize things, but the relationship between the 
Afrikaner and the African is far more complex than it seems," he continued. "In 
our acceptance of them as people, as human beings, we gain their acceptance of 
us as people who also have a place here." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Louis nor Coen Botha, a high school science and mathematics teacher in 
Piet Retief, would describe himself as a liberal. To the contrary, they see 
themselves as politically conservative and dedicated to traditional Afrikaner 
values. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be very far to the right, and I did not want to see any political 
changes -- unless they were back to the way things were," Louis Botha said. 
"Today, I have to say that (President) F.W. de Klerk was right. When he freed 
Nelson Mandela in 1990 and made that speech (on ending apartheid), I thought he 
was as wrong as he could be, that he was putting the survival of the Afrikaner 
at great risk and that he was opening the doors to communism and chaos. I hated 
his 'New South Africa' campaign at the outset. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I changed my mind -- not overnight, but as I watched and reassessed 
things. Although my family doesn't like to hear me say it, I think De Klerk did 
what needed to be done. He clearly changed the course of history for our 
country. We are in for a couple of rough years, and we whites will end up with 
a standard of living lower than what we have. Still, this is right." 
</P>
<P>
 In a quick measure of how his views have changed, Louis Botha recalled: "Three 
years ago, I would have fought to the last drop of blood for our flag and 
anthem. They always meant a lot to me. Just seeing that orange, blue and white 
flag flying in the breeze puffed up my chest, and the anthem made the hairs 
stand on the back of my neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, peace is more important than a flag, and I can always sing 'Die Stem' 
in the shower if I want." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Around the Botha living room, there was an uncomfortable shifting at such 
forthright declarations, and as others spoke in the impromptu family debate, 
deep fears emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercia Botha, Louis' wife, is worried about how she will manage when her class 
of second-graders at an all-white government school in Amsterdam is integrated 
as more black families move into the little town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't speak English that well, and the (black) parents will want their 
children to be taught in English," she said. "And how will I cope with those 
children whose level is so low? And if I can't cope, how will I keep my job? I 
really don't know what I'll do." 
</P>
<P>
 Elize Botha, a sister, who develops programs on family planning, health care 
and environmental issues for black schools, is worried about affirmative 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a government job, and they could give it to a Zulu tomorrow," she 
said. "My knowledge, my experience and my commitment won't even be looked at. 
So, welcome to the new South Africa! None of us knows what lies ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 And Coen Botha is worried by the spate of black attacks on white farmers, 
particularly elderly couples, a number of whom have been killed in recent 
robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Kill a Boer, kill a farmer,' " he said, quoting anti-white slogans of the 
radical Pan Africanist Congress of Azania. " 'One bullet, one settler.' A 
community that can't protect its elders is weak -- that's the way they see us. 
This has to worry us all." 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Botha, in fact, sleeps with a pistol close at hand, and a tall gun-safe 
stands in the corner of his bedroom, packed with weapons and ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people here believe the only way is war, that we Afrikaners have to 
shoot it out with the blacks -- that's crazy," he said. "We have to be 
realistic, we have to remain calm, we cannot undo these changes, like them or 
not. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "But if someone comes and threatens my family or tries to burn me out of my 
home, I will fight. They should know that the Afrikaner defends what is his." 
</P>
<P>
 But all the Bothas regard the white-homeland volkstaat movement among some 
Afrikaners -- Louis Botha put the proportion at 20% -- as wrongheaded, and they 
see the abandonment of apartheid as overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we became aware of what apartheid really was and what the government was 
doing, it was a shock," Elize Botha said. "We never knew, for example, about 
the removal of black families (from areas set aside for whites) and how their 
homes were bulldozed. We never realized how apartheid kept black families 
separated, the man in the city and the families in the homelands. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of what was done in our name was so terribly wrong, dreadfully sinful, 
and we, particularly the Afrikaner people, will bear that responsibility for a 
very long time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Botha agreed. "One of the worst things of apartheid is that it kept 
black and white apart on a daily basis. We never got to know one another, and 
that's why there is so much fear among whites now. At the factory, working 
closely with blacks every day, I have come to see they are just as human as we 
are . . . and I am ashamed of myself that this came as a revelation." 
</P>
<P>
 As much as the Bothas love life on their farm, it has become more of a drain 
on their four salaries -- Coen's wife also teaches -- than an asset. A 
prolonged drought hurt all South African farmers badly. And future government 
policies on agriculture are uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I built this house myself -- and lived with Mercia in the garage for 10 
months while I did it," Louis Botha said. "Imagine asking your fiancee to come 
live with you in a garage on a run-down farm! But we did it. Now, we have to 
ask ourselves each day whether to continue. How much are these wonderful dawns, 
beautiful sunsets and tranquil nights worth?"

<P>
 Late in the 1970s, an Afrikaner business colleague of Alastair Barclay, a real 
estate broker in Johannesburg, told him, "We either have to get apartheid right 
in the next 10 to 15 years, or we give it up as unworkable and accept the 
consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 "For my Afrikaner friend, the question was not of democracy or of morality, 
but of pragmatic politics -- could they make it work," Barclay recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The answer was a long time in coming, but in the end it was no -- apartheid 
could not be made to work. . . . Afrikaners could not get black people to 
accept endless oppression, and they themselves were not willing to play the 
role of oppressors forever and to pay the cost of this folly." 
</P>
<P>
 Barclay, sitting back in the comfortable living room of his home in Rivonia, 
one of Johannesburg's wealthy northern suburbs, recounted the conversation with 
a bittersweet relish. 
</P>
<P>
 He is ready, he said, for majority rule, for the "New South Africa," but he 
knows that it will cost him, certainly in increased taxes, probably in a 
diminished standard of living, perhaps in reverse discrimination and quite 
possibly in a higher level of anxiety over the next two or three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must get on with it," he said. "This old government has lost all 
legitimacy. . . . The only thing the National Party has done right in years is 
sound the retreat for white rule." 
</P>
<P>
 But Barclay, 61, quickly distinguishes himself from "the bleeding- heart 
liberals whom one finds so plentifully in the northern suburbs among 
English-speaking whites." 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to South Africa 28 years ago in part because I was to the right 
politically and because I could not see a future for myself in socialist 
Britain," he said. "I found I was far more conservative than most of the 
English here. If I had the vote then, I would have voted for the Nats, 
apartheid and all. I felt that the races couldn't mix, but my attitude was more 
paternalistic and colonial than ideological. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me years to change. We did not see much of the brutality of apartheid 
-- so much of it took place in the (black) townships and rural areas. Over 
time, however, blacks themselves managed to make us aware of what apartheid was 
doing to them and their families, and I couldn't live with that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Barclay, 52, argued that South Africa's censored press and state-run 
radio and television "kept us thinking everything was fine -- no problems, no 
worries, nothing to fear -- and the Nat government would go on forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was so much we didn't know about what the government was doing -- what 
was going on in the (black) townships, in the prisons, in the schools, the 
brutality with which blacks were driven from their homes because an area was 
set aside for whites. We might hear that something happened, but it would be 
just a brief in the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't see something, you don't think about it. Maybe we didn't want to 
know, you could say, but the fact is we didn't. . . . Once we did start to see 
it, on television, on reports in the overseas media, in some photographs that 
did get into the local press, then we could not ignore it." 
</P>
<P>
 Even when the political violence of the 1980s was close, however, it left 
whites largely untouched. "When Alex was in flames a few years ago with gun 
battles up and down the streets, we couldn't hear or see it, not even the 
smoke," Alastair Barclay said, recalling the "Battle of Alexandra" in the 
nearby black township in February, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would sit here on the patio each evening, sipping our gins and listening 
to the radio describe fighting that might have been in Rwanda but was only two 
minutes away as the crow flies." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jennifer Barclay's son-in-law -- both Barclays have grown children from 
previous marriages -- was wounded in the back by shrapnel when an ANC 
guerrilla, disobeying orders against hitting "soft targets," placed a bomb at 
Magoo's Bar on the Durban waterfront in June, 1986, to protest declaration of a 
state of emergency. Three people were killed and 69 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got to where we are today," Alastair Barclay said, reflecting on the sweep 
of the last decade, "as blacks realized they couldn't win by revolution, no 
matter how many bombs they placed, and whites recognized that maintaining 
apartheid, and that means white rule, in the face of this increasing unrest was 
costing us economic growth. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "From 1976, when the riots broke out in Soweto, people began to realize that 
this couldn't continue, and that became clear to all during the 1980s. But what 
would we have instead and how to achieve it were still questions without 
answers for us." 
</P>
<P>
 "South Africa has been very, very good to me," Barclay said, reflecting on how 
he came to the country after spotting an advertisement for a property valuer 
and has prospered in his three decades here. 
</P>
<P>
 The spacious Barclay house has a swimming pool and a tennis court. Jennifer 
Barclay, once the women's golf champion in South Africa, plays twice a week 
with friends. Their daughter, Katrina, 15, studies at a long-integrated private 
high school. The family has traveled widely in Europe and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "My life would probably be the envy of most American women," Jennifer Barclay 
said. "We have a domestic worker who lives in, we have a gardener and, except 
for chauffeuring my daughter to all her teen-age things, I do as I please with 
my day." 
</P>
<P>
 All this leaves the Barclays, as well as many other whites, with the difficult 
question of how much they have benefited from apartheid while opposing it. Both 
lay most of the blame for apartheid on the Afrikaners, particularly the 
National Party, which came to power in 1948, and acknowledge that rival parties 
were able only to badger the Nationalists into a few reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Alastair Barclay extended his criticism of the National Party to its 
management of the economy, its bloating of the government and the widespread 
corruption found in recent years. "From what I know now, I can see how 
incompetent, dishonest, corrupt and immoral they have been," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But change will come at a cost, the Barclays acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we are going to be taxed more, maybe a lot more," Alastair Barclay 
said. "We will have to pay for past sins. Black education alone will take 
billions, and it has to be priority. We have all been living on the profits of 
apartheid, to borrow a phrase, and no one can seriously object to doing what 
needs doing now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone accepts, I think, that there is a moral duty to put things right as 
much as we can, as fast as we can. We will have to expiate in other ways too. 
We just don't want to be bled white so that people will start voting with their 
feet and leaving." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One change that has surprised -- and delighted -- the Barclays has been the 
easy new relations between whites and blacks in their day-to-day contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a caddy, and he's a helluva nice guy," Jennifer Barclay said. "But 
before the changes started, his conversation used to be limited to 'Yes, ma'am' 
and 'No, ma'am' and the like. He was another black to me, I suppose, and I was 
another white to him. Today, I'm 'Mrs. Barclay,' and we talk about everything." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Hanging proudly from a nail in the wall in the front room of Matanga Dlamini's 
home in Imbali, a black township outside Pietermaritzburg, is the framed 
certificate of service issued on his 1992 retirement from the Natal provincial 
administration -- a 21-year record of promotions from laborer to cleaner to 
messenger to office assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandfather did all right, but we want to do better," Lindiwe Sithole, 16, 
declared with the nonchalance of youth. "I'm going to be a doctor. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just that I want to be a doctor -- I am going to be a doctor," she 
said. "I want to help people, and besides that, doctors earn quite a lot. In 
the new South Africa, people will be able to be all they can be." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindiwe's pronouncement drew knowing smiles from her cousins packed around the 
room, for she is called, one cousin confided later, "the pushy one." 
</P>
<P>
 But Doreen Dlamini, 57, a "tea lady" in the government's provincial 
headquarters but the unquestioned matriarch of a three-generation Zulu family 
of more than 30 sons, daughters, grandchildren and in-laws, almost all living 
within a few houses of each other on the same street, nodded her head in 
affirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 "That girl is going to be somebody and probably a big somebody," Doreen 
Dlamini said, looking up from her potato peeling and inclining her head toward 
Lindiwe. "South Africa is changing, and if she wants to be a doctor there won't 
be anybody standing there saying: 'No, girl, we don't need any more kaffir 
doctors this year. You must do something else.' Those days are over." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the numerous Dlamini cousins, a clan so close-knit they interact more 
like brothers and sisters, expectations are indeed high for the future and a 
constant theme in their conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 They have seen how their parents, although pushed through high school by the 
elder Dlaminis, failed to make it through the narrow, state-controlled funnel 
into good jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Their lives, they say, will be different from those of their parents and 
grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be a teacher -- history and geography," said Precious Dlamini, 
17. "I have the right subjects this year, I know what to take next year and the 
year after, I know what the teachers college requires. . . . Don't worry, I've 
got it all lined up." 
</P>
<P>
 Around the room, there was a litany of ambitions -- teacher, teacher, nurse, 
traffic warden, secretary, lawyer, teacher, bookkeeper and, finally, almost 
sheepishly, policeman. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father was a policeman, and that is what I want to be," said Philip 
Dlamini, 24. "Until now, it has not been possible. It has been too dangerous, 
and for the past 10 years the police were used against the people, not to 
protect them. I think this will change, that in the new South Africa the police 
will be part of the people, and then I want to join the police." 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Dlamini, who finished his schooling five years ago, is now among the 
vast number of unemployed blacks in South Africa, picking up a few days of work 
a month as a casual laborer but not earning much more than enough to pay his 
way at home, where his late father's pension is the main income. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jobs -- there just are no jobs," he said. "Never mind what you want to do, 
never mind what ambitions you have, there are not even jobs shoveling dirt or 
digging holes or collecting trash. . . . We have great hopes for Nelson Mandela 
as president and for the new government, that they will be able to make jobs 
for all." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The hopes are not just those of the young. Pointing to a picture of Mandela on 
an ANC calendar, Matanga Dlamini said: "We are expecting so much of Mandela, we 
have been waiting for him for so long. He was our leader when we were young, 
and he should have been our president long, long ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Zulus, however, this is a highly contentious point of view because of 
Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's bitter rivalry with the ANC leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our leader, Nelson Mandela," Matanga Dlamini said, tapping the 
calendar again for emphasis. "I am a Zulu, and I am proud to be a Zulu. 
Buthelezi is one of our chiefs, and King Goodwill Zwelithini is the king of our 
nation. But South Africa is a modern country with many people other than the 
Zulus, and Nelson Mandela will soon be its president. For the Zulus to destroy 
this beautiful country would be a shame." 
</P>
<P>
 Imbali, a classic black township of four-room houses, many of which have been 
expanded to accommodate growing families, was an early battleground in the war 
between supporters of the ANC and Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fighting was very intense here," Philip Dlamini recalled. "Inkatha had 
some big offensives, trying to push ANC supporters out of the township. The 
police instigated Inkatha to invade. We in the UDF (the pro-ANC United 
Democratic Front) had to defend ourselves, street by street and even house by 
house. . . . Things are quiet now, but we are not fully in control." 
</P>
<P>
 What Imbali has, according to Lindiwe, is "a small piece of peace." 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't defeat them (Inkatha), they didn't defeat us, we both are still 
here," she said. "They hold that bit of land across the road and down the hill, 
we hold the rest, and that is the way it stays. Look, Inkatha is a problem, but 
it won't consume my life. Politics is meant to be an endless tussle, but to 
achieve something."

 Blacks have triumphed in their struggle against apartheid: Minority white rule 
is at an end. Yet the legacy of apartheid weighs heavily upon the whole 
country, whites as well as blacks, as the ANC, no longer a liberation movement 
but a government in waiting, assesses South Africa's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a time to rest," said Albertina Sisulu, wife of Walter, mother of 
Zwelakhe and Max and one of the indomitable figures of the resistance against 
apartheid. "We did not come this far just to sit down on those cushiony seats 
at Parliament. We came to change things." 
</P>
<P>
 Albertina Sisulu, 75, who ranks near the top of the ANC's list of candidates 
in next week's election, is worried -- about both complacency, the feeling that 
political power will solve all problems, and exaggerated expectations of many 
blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't repair the damage done by 45 years of apartheid in 45 days of 
democracy, as some people expect," she said, "but we mustn't be deterred by the 
size of the job." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She is already working on what she expects will be her portfolios in 
Parliament -- health care, local government and housing. "Parliament will need 
those with experience of how people lived under apartheid," she said at her 
Soweto home. "That's where I belong." 
</P>
<P>
 Known lovingly as "Ma Sisulu" and accorded the title "mother of the nation" by 
blacks for her years on the front lines, Albertina Sisulu credits the "Class of 
'49" -- Nelson Mandela, her husband, Walter, others elected at that seminal ANC 
conference -- with the political transformation under way here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The youth of that era dedicated their lives to this cause, and their 
dedication inspired the rest of the nation," she said. "This is an enterprise 
that has been handed from one generation to another and now to another. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the Sisulus, it has been a family enterprise. We've all been in it -- 
father, mother, all the children, even many of the grandchildren now. But 
families are where we are born, where we live and, yes, where we die. . . . The 
struggle against apartheid has been a struggle on behalf of the families of 
South Africa."

WE'RE OPEN; MERCHANTS WHO DIDN'T QUIT OR MOVE ARE BACK IN BUSINESS, BUT MANY 
STRUGGLE

 Three months after the Northridge earthquake shattered their lives, merchants 
along one hard-hit block of Reseda Boulevard are getting back to business. As 
for getting back to normal -- well, that's another story. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Jackie Jones, owner of Jones Coffee Co. When she first laid eyes on 
her quake-devastated boutique -- a half-block north of the Northridge Meadows 
Apartments, where 16 people died in the quake -- the only item left intact 
among the spilled coffee beans and shattered Victorian collectibles was a 
solitary plate. After 15 years, Jones thought she would never open her doors 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet open she did. Jones called vendors to replace her $50,000 in lost 
merchandise. She worked out deals to defer payments. She tapped her savings 
while waiting for word on her Small Business Administration loan application. 
Like many shopkeepers in the area who are still limping along in the aftermath 
of the earthquake, Jones shows a spirited determination to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the seven weeks since she reopened, Jones sees only half as many 
customers as before the quake, and she's selling more tacky wax -- used to glue 
objects to hard surfaces -- and earthquake-proof plate hangers than expensive 
china. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a breakable business," she sighed. "It's going to take a while for 
people to buy breakables again." 
</P>
<P>
 Along this Northridge block, a mile from the epicenter, proprietors of small 
restaurants, dry cleaners, nail salons and boutiques in three strip malls 
recount a litany of frustrations and fears that haven't abated. Their sales are 
down anywhere from 10% to 80% since the quake, mostly because they lost 
customers from the condemned apartments that line surrounding streets, and 
local homeowners are preoccupied with fixing their houses. Many businesses have 
cut prices and boosted advertising, but some longtime customers avoid the area 
altogether because quake damage and sightseers have clogged thoroughfares and 
altered traffic patterns. Calling It Quits 
</P>
<P>
 Some business owners have called it quits. In the once-thriving Northridge 
Garden Center, where Jones has her shop, half the spaces are vacant. The former 
owner of the mini-mall also walked away last month, signing the deed over to 
the lender, who is only now starting to repair cracked walls, damaged floors 
and ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
 For many merchants who remain, it's a day-to-day existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Roya Saberzadeh, owner of Rochie's Greek Row, in another strip mall down the 
street from Northridge Garden Center, said her sales are only 50% of the 
pre-quake level, mostly because of continuing turmoil at Cal State Northridge 
nearby. Her clothing and memorabilia shop caters to CSUN sororities and 
fraternities, but school enrollment is down and many campus facilities remain 
closed. Students who do come in buy more off-the-shelf items, which are less 
profitable than the custom lettering on sweaters and sweat shirts that are 
Rochie's specialty. 
</P>
<P>
 With a $4,000 to $5,000 monthly overhead, Saberzadeh said she's losing money 
and wonders how she'll replace thousands of dollars worth of wrecked equipment. 
She bargained for a 15% rent reduction, but agreed to a new three-year lease in 
return, and is disputing rent payments her landlord says she owes from just 
after the quake. She'd like to get a Small Business Administration loan and 
start a mail-order catalogue to lessen her dependence on CSUN. But Saberzadeh's 
loan application hasn't been filed yet, because she must pay $1,200 to an 
accountant to re-create necessary tax documents that were lost in a fire that 
destroyed her family's Chatsworth house a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the earthquake, her family's house was being rebuilt, but it now has 
$50,000 in earthquake damage. Saberzadeh was told at a Federal Emergency 
Management Administration center that the family can't get a grant because they 
weren't living in the house during the quake. Meanwhile, Saberzadeh, her father 
and brother pay a $2,300 monthly mortgage on the house plus $800 rent for two 
rooms where they now live. 
</P>
<P>
 Saberzadeh said she has borrowed money from her father and friends to keep her 
business going. Without an SBA loan and a pickup in sales, she said, she can't 
hold out that much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nightmare," Saberzadeh said. "Every morning before I open my shop, I'm 
someplace. I'm in this line, that line, at this interview, that interview. I'm 
being gobbled up by paperwork." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a gritty optimism pervades the business community here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to stick around," declared Royal Cleaners owner Ara Boyajian, even 
though his sales are down 30% to 40%. He said 1994 "is a hang-in-there year, 
and I'm not a quitter." Quake Boom 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some merchants reported a temporary jump in sales following the 
earthquake, which they attribute to the damage-seeking sightseers who made the 
Northridge Meadows apartment complex a tourist stop. For weeks, tour buses with 
foreign visitors would stop there. At the Cameramart International photo supply 
shop, in a mini-mall next door to Northridge Meadows, owner Nubar Costantian 
hung a yellow banner across his awning to announce his reopening, and figured 
he gained some new customers among the sightseers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tourist crowds have abated and, for many, business has slowed again. 
Northridge Meadows is slated for demolition May 2, and shopkeepers now worry 
that the tear-down process -- expected to take longer than usual because 
evidence in the rubble will be gathered for lawsuits -- will prevent customers 
from getting to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the steady foot traffic from local apartment dwellers that they once 
relied on, some shop owners are devising new ways to drum up sales. The Kids at 
Heart gift shop and Coco's Family Restaurant, both in Northridge Garden Center, 
offered discounted food and merchandise last Saturday to customers wearing 
pajamas. Kids at Heart owner Laura D'Angelo spent $500 advertising the 
promotion, but with sales at the shop off 30% since the quake, she said, "You 
can't just have a sale, you have to have an event." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Truly Yours Restaurant & Bar, general manager John Beauchamp said he's 
been selling two-for-one discount meal cards to area residents, which has been 
a boon for business and helped pack the cafe at lunchtime one afternoon last 
week. But Beauchamp said sales are still down 10% to 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street, Scott Caruthers, co-owner of the Exotic Fitness exercise 
salon, has begun advertising in phone books outside the area, distributing 
flyers and selling personal training sessions for just $35 a week -- barely 
enough to cover his expenses but enough to get his normal volume of customers 
in the door. Business at the tanning salon he co-owns next door has been 
nonexistent, he said, because former customers are afraid of tanning beds 
collapsing in an earthquake. So Caruthers is considering offering martial arts 
lessons. "We're in an adaptive phase," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others said they're tightening their belts as never before. At Kimary's Nail 
Boutique, across the street from Exotic Fitness, where business is down nearly 
15%, owner Kim Dellibovi got a $10,000 bank loan to get back in operation. But 
she cut out such extras as hanging silk plants, premium hand soap, ceramic 
decor and free cookies, and replaced her "super-duper" phone with a basic 
model. Many customers, who had been busy repairing their houses, have been 
trickling back in. "Their nails were a mess," Dellibovi said, happily adding 
that those customers had to shell out for new sets of acrylic nails. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are those who find their hope running thin. Harry Paissides, 
co-owner of Reseda Hye Market, in the strip mall next to Northridge Meadows, 
said 80% of his business has disappeared as the ethnic population that 
frequented his specialty grocery and deli were forced from damaged apartments. 
Next door, Sujatha Balasubramanian, owner of Paru's Indian restaurant, and 
across the street, Gianni Fontana di Trevi, who owns a dry cleaning and tailor 
shop, said they used to rely on referrals and employees from Northridge Fashion 
Center. With that mall basically closed for the next several months, they 
wonder how long they can hang on. 
</P>
<P>
 Landlords also complain of trying times the past three months. Bill Matthews, 
who manages two strip centers on this block of Reseda Boulevard that his family 
owns, has completed repairs there and has been negotiating with tenants over 
rent credits and reductions. He said he has had to explain to SBA workers what 
a lease is, and is trying to restructure his debt with a mortgage banker whose 
attitude is, "If you can't enforce contracts with tenants, we will." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Northridge Garden Center owner Beth Burnam one month ago signed that 
strip mall over to the lender, Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Co. in 
Hartford, Conn., after failing to agree on loan terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix replaced boarded-up windows with glass, but has only now begun to fix 
the damaged walls, ceilings and floors. Phoenix spokesman Tom Gariepy said 
tenants won't pay rent while structural repairs are under way, and expects it 
will be six months before the final cosmetic work is done. 
</P>
<P>
 Some shopkeepers decided not to wait, and instead relocated. 
</P>
<P>
 Helmut Behensky, owner of Bea's Swim & Sport, pictured an aftershock hitting 
and worried about what would happen when customers were there trying on 
swimsuits. So he reopened his shop in Thousand Oaks, but said he would consider 
going back to Northridge when his six-month lease expires. 
</P>
<P>
 Sew Fine, a sewing supplies shop, moved to Tarzana because owner Roseann 
Salvinger feared working in a damaged building. 
</P>
<P>
 But others, like Jackie Jones of Jones Coffee Co., plan to stick it out. By 
the entrance, Jones hung the plate that outlasted the quake as a symbol of 
endurance and a reminder, she said, that "I'm supposed to be here."

 Vitesse Semiconductor Corp., a Camarillo maker of gallium arsenide computer 
chips, said it narrowed its fiscal second-quarter loss to $1.7 million, from a

</P>
<P>
 For the quarter that ended March 31, the company said revenue surged 44%, to 
$8.72 million from $6.07 million a year earlier. The company attributed the 
improved results to increased shipments to the communications market and cost 
reduction.

million, from a loss of $11.6 million a year earlier. Sales for the latest 
six-month period grew 47%, to $16.8 million from $11.4 million a year earlier.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: IWERKS TO REPORT LOSS FOR QUARTER AS REVENUE FALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Iwerks Entertainment Inc., a Burbank supplier of special-format movie theaters 
and virtual-reality attractions, said it will report a loss for its fiscal 
third quarter ended March 31 on an 11% decline in revenue to approximately $10 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 A year earlier, Iwerks earned $2.3 million on $11.2 million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said its third quarter results were hurt by increased research and 
development costs, delayed closings of expected sponsorship contracts for its 
touring theater system, weaker-than-expected winter attendance at the theaters 
and higher fixed costs. It also cited reduced theater system sales as a reason 
for the loss, which Iwerks said is due to its shift away from that business and 
toward development of its Cinetropolis urban entertainment centers, which 
combine theaters and virtual-reality games under one roof. 
</P>
<P>
 The reduced sales are also expected to "have a continuing impact on 
fourth-quarter results," Iwerks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Iwerks' announcement Thursday sent its stock tumbling $5.25 a share on Friday 
to $14. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's initial public offering last October was one of the hottest 
stock sales of the year. On the first day of trading, Iwerks' stock opened at 
$33 a share -- nearly double the $18 offering price -- and later hit $37. On 
Monday, Iwerks' stock closed unchanged at $14.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: THOUSAND OAKS THE NERVE CENTER FOR GM MARKETING WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A little-noticed building in Thousand Oaks is the nerve center for marketing 
46 models of General Motors cars throughout the West, housing more than 200 
employees who direct GM's sales and public affairs operations from Texas to 
Hawaii and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the two-story center -- at an address that company 
officials prefer to keep secret lest it become a target of anyone holding a 
grievance against America's No. 1 auto maker -- was the birthplace of GM's 
highly publicized "value selling" experiment. It's an effort to put a realistic 
sticker price on a car, something close to the final, actual sales price. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which is supposed to eliminate bargaining from auto retailing, 
was launched in California and is being phased in nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the Thousand Oaks facility is responsible for planning and carrying 
out marketing strategies for six GM nameplates -- Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac, 
Pontiac, Oldsmobile and Saturn. 
</P>
<P>
 It also houses top Western officials of GMC Trucks, as well as the auto 
maker's financing arm, General Motors Acceptance Corp., and Motors Holding, a 
GM division that helps establish new dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Detroit gives all of us a great deal of independence," said one of the 
center's key officials, Carl E. Sheffer, Western regional public affairs 
director for North American operations. "We have our own board of directors, 
which makes many of the policy decisions affecting GM operations in 16 Western 
states." 
</P>
<P>
 When it opened in 1985, the center brought together several units that were 
formerly based in Westlake Village and the San Fernando Valley. Since then, 
additional operations have moved in from Santa Monica and Century City. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's location in Southern California, long known as a prime market for 
foreign-built cars, has been particularly challenging, Sheffer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost market share for a number of years, but that's finally turned around. 
We expect GM's share of the market in this region to increase several 
percentage points this year." For example, GM says, Pontiac's retail sales in 
California through March of this year were up 82% to 5,158, compared with a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first five months of the current model year, the company's sales in the 
West were up 30% over the same period a year ago, Sheffer reported. He credited 
the value-selling program and an improved perception of American-made autos for 
much of the increase.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: CALLERS TO TANDON CORP. GET ONLY VOICE MAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Apparently, you're going to have to settle for voice mail if you want to call 
Tandon Corp., the once high-flying Simi Valley computer maker. 
</P>
<P>
 Callers to Tandon, which filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition last year, now 
hear the following taped message: "Tandon Corp. has discontinued all North 
American sales operations. Please send any future written claims to Tandon 
Corp., c/o TSL Holdings, 405 Science Drive, Moorpark CA 93021." 
</P>
<P>
 An official at Golden Systems Inc., a Simi Valley producer of power supply 
units for personal computers, says he has no idea how to contact Tandon or its 
founder, Sirjang (Jugi) Tandon. Jugi Tandon owns 3% of the stock of Golden, 
whose chief executive is Jugi's brother, Jay Tandon.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE IN MEXICO, CONSULTANT SAYS

 The recent assassination of Mexico's leading presidential candidate put a 
damper on an economic development conference in Guadalajara earlier this month, 
but opportunities still abound for U. S. firms wanting to do business in 
Mexico, according to an Oxnard trade consultant who attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was jumpy and security was very tight," said Mary Ellen Taffle, 
president of Magellan Enterprises Co."The president of Mexico was supposed to 
speak, but he sent a deputy instead. Guatemala, Chile and other countries made 
similar switches." 
</P>
<P>
 Taffle attended the Congress of the Americas on behalf of several Ventura 
County clients who hope to set up manufacturing or marketing operations south 
of the border to take advantage of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many small and medium-sized U. S. companies could do well in Mexico, 
especially if they produce items such as pipes that can help strengthen the 
country's infrastructure," Taffle noted.

FORMER OUTLAW BREAKS INTO NEW TERRITORY; IN BLACKHAWK COUNTRY, SOUTHERN ROCKER 
HENRY PAUL RISES AGAIN WITH EMPHASIS ON BLUEGRASS AND POP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Henry Paul is fired up, and that's understandable -- it's not every artist who 
gets a second lease on his musical life at age 44. But after putting in close 
to two decades of work with Southern-rock band the Outlaws, Paul has become one 
of the hottest new voices in country music as front man with his new group, 
BlackHawk. 
</P>
<P>
 In BlackHawk, which performs tonight at Incahoots in Fullerton, Paul is joined 
by the veteran songwriting team of Dave Robbins and Van Stephenson, who between 
them have penned hits for the likes of Restless Heart, Eric Clapton, Dan Seals 
and Poco. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's debut album on Arista Records, "BlackHawk," is heartfelt but 
commercial, contemporary but rooted in tradition, with tight, three-part 
harmonies, jangling guitars and mandolins coupled with enough big hooks to 
catch an ocean of country-music fans. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent phone interview, Paul never seemed to tire of talking about 
the group's music. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a real keen understanding of what I consider to be the best elements 
of bluegrass music, but we have sensibilities about us that come from the pop 
music of the '70s and '80s," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a great deal of finesse behind what we do, but there's power as well. 
There's an edge, an attitude, that's a very important part of what we are. But 
we don't rely on the instrumentalists to carry us, like in the Outlaws. We rely 
more on the songs and the singers. With us, substance is paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, the band is also augmented by commercial sensibilities. I'm not 
going to say we didn't take that into consideration. We didn't make this record 
to be oblique or bizarre; we made a record to connect. But in the process, we 
wrote some damn good songs. There's a lot of songs on the record that are 
inside and a little dark." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul grew up in Tampa, Fla., and was influenced by Flatt & Scruggs and Johnny 
Cash, who had syndicated country music television shows in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the first country rock bands began to surface in the later part of that 
decade, Paul realized what he wanted to do with his own music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a goal of bringing country music into a pop arena," he said. "In the 
Outlaws, I think we were very successful at doing that. We were all products of 
the Byrds-Buffalo Springfield-Poco sort of phenomenon, which was, I think, very 
influential on a lot of groups." 
</P>
<P>
 After years on the road with the Outlaws, Paul felt it was time to settle into 
a less raucous, rock-oriented groove. In Robbins and Stephenson, he found a 
pair of kindred souls with whom he could work smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been writing with those guys for a long time now; we've been like a 
team," he said. "I dig Van and Dave. We always got along and became real good 
friends. I think (Arista) was looking at me as a solo act initially, but Van 
and Dave said, 'Well, we'd like to do something, too,' so we went ahead and 
gave it a try." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul says BlackHawk's music appeals especially to people who grew up with the 
country and Southern-styled rock that was popularized in the '70s by the 
Outlaws, the Marshall Tucker Band, the Eagles and the Allman Brothers Band. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to look at it as some sort of marketing tool, there's a great 
deal of support for us because we're not kids. We're not an Osmonds kind of 
pinup deal," he said. "We've made a record that really hits a nerve musically 
for a lot of people from our generation." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that BlackHawk's album has debuted in the Top 30 in Billboard's country 
albums charts and its first single, "Goodbye Says It All," has become an 
immediate hit on country radio, Paul has much to look forward to. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a committed group, not a short-term project," Paul said. "Our goal is 
to sell out some theaters, where 2,000 or 3,000 people come out to spend a 
night with BlackHawk and dig what it's all about, song-wise and musically." 
</P>
<P>
 * BlackHawk performs tonight at 9:30 p.m. at Incahoots, 1401 Lemon St., 
Fullerton. $6. (714) 441-1666.

CHATSWORTH FIRM GETS BIGGEST U.S. QUAKE LOAN; BUSINESS: SBA IS EXPECTED TO 
APPROVE $10-MILLION CREDIT TO DAMAGED MEDICAL MANUFACTURER THAT THREATENED TO 
LEAVE THE VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Chatsworth manufacturer hit hard by the Jan. 17 earthquake is expected to 
receive a multimillion-dollar loan this week from the Small Business 
Administration that would be by far the largest loan made by the SBA following 
the devastating temblor.  
</P>
<P>
 Dan Sandel, owner of Devon Industries Inc., said he was told Monday by an SBA 
official that the agency would approve a low-interest loan of about $10 
million. The approval came during Sandel's visit with the Valley Industry & 
Commerce Assn., which is here on its annual trip to the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which manufacturers disposable surgical supplies, employed 375 
people at three Chatsworth buildings. The loan would go to rebuild the largest 
plant, replace destroyed machines and upgrade operations. 
</P>
<P>
 For Sandel, the substantial loan may have meant the difference between 
rebuilding in Chatsworth and leaving California. He did not have earthquake 
insurance when the quake collapsed a concrete rooftop parking lot onto his 
65,000-square-foot production facility. Fourteen injection molding machines, 
each costing about $200,000, were damaged beyond repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the loan, Sandel, who has another plant in Ohio, said he would have 
left California and what he regards as its inhospitable business climate. 
Instead, he said he plans to modernize the new plant and fill it with 
state-of-the-art equipment. He said other companies are taking this approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the SBA did for me is like a Marshall Plan," said Sandel, whose company 
had more than $60 million in sales in 1993. "Los Angeles can upgrade its 
manufacturing capacity just like Europe did after World War II." 
</P>
<P>
 The quake knocked out more than just one of Sandel's plants. The self-made, 
Israeli-born entrepreneur had started a program to employ and house homeless 
people that was believed to be the first welfare program in the nation run by a 
businessman. He said he hopes to renew the effort after Devon returns to 
health. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandel was one of several VICA board members who expressed gratitude for the 
Clinton Administration's rapid and massive relief and reconstruction assistance 
following the quake, which wreaked its most severe havoc in the San Fernando 
Valley and surrounding communities. Sandel called it "an absolutely outstanding 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 During the first of three days of meetings here with Administration officials, 
lawmakers and lobbyists, the 38-member delegation was briefed by John Emerson, 
an assistant to the President and coordinator of the Administration's 
earthquake recovery effort. Emerson is an ex-chief deputy to Los Angeles City 
Atty. James Hahn and is well known to several VICA members. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson, who had made four trips to Southern California in the past 12 days, 
ticked off various initiatives undertaken by the Administration to assist the 
quake- and recession-battered region. Most prominent was as much as $10.3 
billion in federal aid, which he referred to as the disaster's silver lining. 
</P>
<P>
 "This infusion of capital and the impact of creating jobs in Southern 
California has perhaps spurred what I think we would all categorize as a very 
fragile but very real recovery," Emerson said. 
</P>
<P>
 As befits Clinton's ex-California campaign manager, Emerson reflected the 
Administration's sensitivity to the state's political importance. He said the 
quake relief effort "proves that government -- well-directed by people who care 
-- can work effectively and efficiently." And he repeatedly touted bipartisan 
cooperation by Clinton and Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Notably absent from Emerson's honor roll was Gov. Pete Wilson. The Republican, 
who is seeking reelection this year, recently angered Clinton aides by 
announcing the reopening of the Santa Monica Freeway -- rebuilt entirely with 
federal funds -- without including them. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the steps taken by the Administration to speed recovery from the quake 
was spurred, in part, by the efforts of VICA and the example of Devon 
Industries. SBA regulations had limited disaster loans to businesses with fewer 
than 1,000 workers to $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to Devon as symptomatic of companies that had significant regional 
economic impact, VICA was one of several business groups that lobbied SBA 
Administrator Erskine Bowles to lower the threshold to qualify as "a major 
source of employment." The group has 350 member companies representing about 
150,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, he reduced it to 250 last month -- making Devon and hundreds of 
other smaller and mid-size firms potentially eligible for much larger loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Devon was mentioned at that time as one of the cases that deserved the major 
source of employment treatment," Bernard Kulik, the SBA assistant administrator 
for disaster assistance, confirmed. "VICA was one of the groups involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandal said he's been told the loan would be repayable at 4% interest annually 
over 30 years. Kulik must still approve these terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandel, a naturalized American, said he also plans to revive his ambitious 
effort to repay society for his success by hiring homeless to work in his 
factory and giving them a virtually free apartment nearby for up to nine 
months. He said eight individuals were in the program when the quake hit. He 
discontinued the program when he temporarily had to lay off 106 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, attorney Benjamin Reznik of Encino, VICA's 
earthquake recovery task force chairman, said that a coalition of Valley 
business groups will receive $250,000 from the U.S. Economic Development Agency 
to devise the Valley's first economic development plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Reznik said he expects the Los Angeles City Council, through which the 
development agency's money is disbursed, to approve the funds soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to come up with a real plan that we can implement" to counter the 
loss of aerospace jobs due to post-Cold War defense cuts, Reznik said. He said 
the San Fernando Valley Regional Economic Council would try to complete the 
plan in six to nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 VICA, whose large Washington contingent includes City Councilwoman Laura 
Chick, enjoyed increased access to Clinton Administration officials last year. 
This year it is shooting higher: The group has tentatively scheduled a White 
House meeting Wednesday with the President, vice president and Cabinet 
secretaries. Organizers said they remained uncertain who would host them at 
this final event of their fifth visit. 
</P>
<P>
 But they took their case directly to Emerson on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting the scheduled White House visit, attorney David Fleming, a former VICA 
chairman, said: "Some of us would like to thank the President personally, if at 
all possible." 
</P>
<P>
 "Who are you guys meeting with?" Emerson replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Not missing a beat, Nicholas Liakas, chief executive of Digital Imaging of 
Southern California, quipped: "The President."

PARKING LOT SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ladies and gentlemen, step right up! The big top has arrived in the San 
Fernando Valley and is open to all. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the main tent are china, furniture, cordless phones and quilts from 
parts near and far. There are even gadgets for the little ones -- all for a 
special price. And they take American Express. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge Fashion Center's Broadway department store, shuttered since the 
Jan. 17 temblor, has found a new venue -- two air-conditioned tents pitched in 
the middle of the devastated mall's parking lot. Nicknamed the "Home Dome," the 
makeshift store that opened Friday has already become a popular spot for Valley 
residents looking to replace damaged home furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday at midday, the tents were packed. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have been ecstatic that we have done this," said Broadway employee 
Judy Spence, sitting behind a French country-style desk for sale. "Furniture 
and china are selling real big right now." 
</P>
<P>
 From the outside, the two interconnected tents look more likely to contain a 
trapeze act than a set of kitchen knives, but inside it looks just like any 
other Broadway. Colorful item displays and sale signs accessorize the interior, 
and merchandise is departmentalized. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They've done a wonderful job of making it attractive," said Lucille Malvani, 
68, of Granada Hills, who was shopping for glasses to replace a set that fell 
out of her cupboard when the earth shook. "And I feel much safer beneath this 
ceiling than I do in a regular store right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The carpeted tents -- 300 feet long and 60 feet wide -- will remain open until 
the main mall store reopens in late fall, according to Steve Holden, operations 
manager for the Home Dome, which employs about 75 people. The tents were 
erected, decorated and stocked with items by Broadway personnel, he said, all 
in five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most (customers) are amazed that you can put something together that looks 
this good this quick in a parking lot," Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dome carries only furniture, electronics and housewares because The 
Broadway considers these items in high demand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shop-aholics sifted through the goods with appraisers' eyes on Monday, looking 
for that special bargain. Most seemed to find something worth buying. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to have a place to shop around here again," said Lois Kranobsky, 
42, of Chatsworth, looking at bedspreads. "I love the mall. So far, the prices 
we've seen here have been wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all shoppers agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they have anything cheaper than they had before," said a 
Fashion Center regular who asked to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-tech tents were made by the Clamshell Co., a Ventura firm that 
specializes in temporary structures. About 140 of the tents -- which can 
supposedly resist winds of up to 120 m.p.h. and are built to seismic standards 
-- were used to house airplanes during the Persian Gulf War. They were also 
used as relief centers after Hurricane Andrew in Florida and Hurricane Iniki in 
Hawaii, according to Mark Alexander, marketing manager for Clamshell. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a tent," Alexander said, even though another company official 
disclosed that it is made of laminated fabric. "This is the equivalent of a 
traditional metal building," Alexander continued, "except it can be put up 
relatively quick, it can be reused and no foundations are required." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the stores surrounding the mall suffered a sharp decrease in business 
after the mall was damaged, but since the Home Dome was erected, they have 
noticed an unexpected increase in customers and sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the foot traffic in the area, I've noticed an increase of about 
100%," said Mark Mandel, sales manager for the Goodyear Tire Center, located 
next door to the Home Dome. "Most of our business was from people shopping at 
Broadway, and when it closed, people didn't know we were open. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did in one day of business Saturday what we had been doing in four days." 
</P>
<P>
 The mall's Sears and Broadway stores should open by late fall, said David 
Gruber, president of Metropolitan Estates Property Co., the Dallas-based firm 
that owns the Northridge Fashion Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Robinsons May store will not open until early 1995, and Bullocks -- which 
is being completely rebuilt -- is scheduled to reopen in the summer of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're so desperate to shop," said Sue Sears of Northridge, who was in the 
dome with her sister, Nancy Bomer. Both women lost a lot of glassware and 
porcelain during the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only things open around here were the Targets, the cheap stuff. Here they 
have more good things, like china. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be back."

INFANT DIES IN ACCIDENTAL FIRE SET BY A CHILD; TRAGEDY: THE 11-MONTH-OLD HAD 
BEEN PLACED IN HER AUNT'S CARE LESS THAN A WEEK EARLIER BY CHILD WELFARE 
OFFICIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An 11-month-old girl was fatally injured Sunday night -- less than a week 
after child welfare officials placed her in an aunt's care -- when a fire swept 
through the aunt's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire investigators said the blaze was apparently set accidentally about 11:30 
p.m. when one of five children living at the house ignited a bunk bed with a 
cigarette lighter. It quickly engulfed the house. 
</P>
<P>
 The aunt, Anna Alvarez, and another woman who was living in the house were 
both injured getting four children out of the house, but were unable to rescue 
the baby, Rebecca Clark, fire investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters later broke through a back window and pulled the girl out. By 
then, she was in full cardiac arrest and had second- and third-degree burns 
over as much as 90% of her body, said Fire Capt. Dirk Wegner. She was 
pronounced dead about 40 minutes later at Palmdale Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez -- who has been renting the house in the 38900 block of 2nd Street 
East for about a year -- said Rebecca was the daughter of her younger sister, 
Robin Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez, 29, who is not a licensed foster-care provider, said she was given 
temporary custody of Clark's three children by county officials on April 11 
after her sister was unable to explain how her infant daughter's skull was 
fractured. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark had lived in her sister's Palmdale house with her three children until 
last week, when she moved to Pacoima, Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services 
confirmed that Rebecca and two brothers, age 2 and 3, were removed from their 
mother's custody April 11, but declined to give the reason, citing 
confidentiality laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuyler Sprowles, public information director for Children's Services, said 
it is often thought best for abused or neglected children to be placed with 
relatives, even if they are not licensed as foster-care providers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The advantage is they have a bond with the family and familiarity with 
extended family," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, child advocates have criticized the county agency and federal 
bureaucracies for putting obstacles in the way of those who want to take 
custody of neglected or abused relatives rather than have them placed with 
strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprowles said, however, that placement of abused and neglected children with 
relatives has become increasingly common. 
</P>
<P>
 Of approximately 38,000 children currently placed outside their homes by 
Children's Services, 20,000 are living with relatives who are not licensed 
foster-care providers, Sprowles said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, county caseworkers picked up Clark's two boys from a neighbor's 
house where Alvarez is staying with her 3-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez said she hopes to regain custody of her sister's children. Sprowles 
said a hearing will be scheduled to decide. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez said the surviving children are well, just "shaken up." She said she 
aggravated a back injury trying to get the children out of the house. Her 
roommate, Stella Inez, who returned from a trip to the store to find the house 
in flames, suffered second-degree burns to her shoulders and fractured her 
right wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 One firefighter suffered second-degree burns. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unknown how the children got the cigarette lighter or which child 
actually set the bed ablaze, said Deputy Dan Watters of the sheriff's arson 
detail.

TEACHER FACES 2 NEW CHARGES OF SEXUAL ASSAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A Saugus elementary school teacher who is already facing charges of sexually 
assaulting a colleague has been charged with attacking two other females, 
including a 17-year-old he met while on duty as a Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputy, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors filed four additional felony charges Friday against Edward Keith 
Culhane, 35, of Santa Clarita, who worked as a sheriff's deputy from January, 
1982, to August, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Culhane is charged with raping the teen-ager in June, 1990, after luring her 
to a Comfort Inn in Lakewood on the pretense of helping her with a college 
English paper, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert B. Foltz Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 While on patrol early one morning, Culhane, who worked out of the Lennox 
station, pulled over the car the girl, then 17, was driving and struck up a 
conversation with her, according to the prosecutor. Culhane gave his phone 
number to the college student, who later called the deputy and agreed to meet 
him for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 At breakfast, Culhane allegedly offered to help the girl with her homework, 
and the two went to a Lakewood motel that was made available to deputies who 
had court appearances in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 At the motel, prosecutors said Culhane raped the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl filed a complaint with the Sheriff's Department, which was 
investigated, but no charges were brought until recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Culhane left the Sheriff's Department 14 months after the alleged assault. 
Citing policy, sheriff's officials would not discuss the circumstances of his 
departure, but Foltz said it was the culmination of a "lengthy investigation" 
into numerous charges, including the alleged rape of the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "He left as part of an agreement to resolve some disciplinary actions he had," 
Foltz said, adding that the agreement also resolved a workers' compensation 
claim that Culhane had filed. 
</P>
<P>
 A single count of sexual battery, also filed last week, alleges that Culhane 
touched a 22-year-old baby-sitter in a lewd manner. "He got sexually out of 
line with her," Foltz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred in early 1992, several months after he left the 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Foltz said Culhane often told women he met that his marriage was failing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like he was a 24-hour womanizer," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Culhane's attorney, Kenneth Leon Schreiber of Los Angeles, declined to comment 
on the case, saying he will not receive any paperwork on the new charges until 
he appears in court with his client. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Culhane faces seven felony counts, including three charges related to 
an alleged assault on a teacher he worked with at Santa Clarita Elementary 
School in Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary hearing on the three charges is scheduled for Thursday, but 
Schreiber said he will postpone it so he can become familiar with the new 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Schreiber said he would bring Culhane into Newhall Municipal Court before 
Thursday for an arraignment on the new charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges against Culhane were first filed two months ago after a teacher 
alleged that he attacked her on Nov. 5, 1993, in a classroom after students had 
been dismissed for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The 44-year-old teacher has since filed a $1-million claim against the Saugus 
Union School District, alleging that she was sexually assaulted and that 
district officials directed the woman not to report the incident to police. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials have said that Culhane was put on paid leave Jan. 14, 
pending the results of the criminal investigation. Culhane was in his first 
semester at the elementary school when the woman made the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter written earlier this year to the Saugus Union School District 
Board of Education, Culhane denied the woman's charge against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Culhane is currently free after posting $50,000 bail.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: ARCHITECTURE GROUP HONORS LOCAL DESIGNS 
</P>

<P>
 Long thought of among outsiders as a bland landscape of homogeneous 
single-family tract homes, the San Fernando Valley is actually home to a number 
of architecturally unique structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those structures were recognized recently by the San Fernando Valley 
chapter of the American Institute of Architects in an effort to encourage more 
quality architecture in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Valley is viewed as an endless sprawl, which indeed much of it is, and it 
is hard for the community to feel that sense of attachment and value," said 
Michael Webb, an architectural writer based in West Los Angeles and one of the 
AIA judges. "But all of us on the jury were impressed with the quality of work 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said he chose an Encino home for the 20-plus-year award for its timeless 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "The open, transparent light of the home made it very much the ideal of what a 
California house would be," Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
 The home, built in 1973 for Dr. Melvin Schapiro and his family, opens into 
three pavilions, for living, sleeping and guests. The pavilions meet in the 
glass and wood entryway with a view of a huge oak tree that stands in the 
middle of the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Insulated from neighbors with lush shrubs, the glass walls of the living area 
are hidden from view, yet open for space and light.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is pure quality," Webb said of the house. "It hadn't dated stylistically 
and is an extraordinary piece of art." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Gelber, the architect who designed the house, said the 
4,000-square-foot structure was built to make the most use of its small lot. "I 
wanted to build an intelligent house that just wasn't a big box," said Gelber, 
who used yard space to expand the living area and natural light to make the 
rooms look larger. "And it stood the test of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Also recognized by AIA was the Warner Park Stage Pavilion in Woodland Hills 
designed by Jeffrey M. Kalban & Associates of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1-million, pale-yellow structure was completed last August and marks a 
milestone for the park, which for the past 18 years had been holding its 
Concert in the Park series on a temporary stage made of two trailers bolted 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly built stage curves and gently slopes onto the grassy park area so 
there are no barriers between the performers and audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want to build something that would kill the informality of it all," 
said Jeffrey Kalban. "What makes any project successful is a resolution of the 
clients' needs and attention paid to the surroundings." 
</P>
<P>
 A Sherman Oaks home restored by Robbins & Bown Inc. also won a citation, and a 
Woodland Hills home designed by Kalban & Associates won a merit award.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: LAKE VIEW TERRACE; POLICE IDENTIFY MAN SLAIN NEAR DAM PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities on Monday identified a San Fernando man as the motorist who was 
fatally shot during a car chase this weekend near Hansen Dam Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Louie Herrera, 23, died after a bullet struck him in the back of the head 
Sunday as he was driving eastbound on Foothill Boulevard near Osborne Street, 
Los Angeles Police Lt. Gary Hallden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide detectives are searching for two males in a light blue Nissan pickup 
truck who fired several shots at Herrera as they drove behind his El Camino, 
Hallden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that the pickup positioned itself behind and to the 
right of Herrera's car before the truck's passenger leaned out a window and 
fired seven times, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After he was shot, Herrera lost control of his car, which rolled over once 
before hitting several parked cars, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics pronounced Herrera dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, investigators believed the shooting stemmed from either a gang 
dispute or an argument in the park. But on Monday, police discounted both 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not know what happened," said Hallden. "But as far as we know, it had 
nothing to do with (a confrontation) in the park or was gang-related. . . . We 
do know the vehicles had probably been following each other a long time before 
the shooting." TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; CITY PLANS APPEAL OF AHMANSON RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Calabasas plans to appeal a court ruling that favors the 
environmental review process used by Ventura County supervisors to approve the 
Ahmanson Ranch project. 
</P>
<P>
 "This process went forward without any reference to or concern for impacts on 
the city of Calabasas," Calabasas City Atty. Charles Vose said. "They barely 
even discussed the city. They talk about this as a regional issue, but the 
major portion of the traffic will go through Calabasas." 
</P>
<P>
 After a closed-door meeting last week, the Calabasas City Council instructed 
Vose to appeal a March 4 ruling by a Ventura County judge that found that 
Ventura County officials met all state environmental requirements when they 
approved the mini-city in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In her ruling, Superior Court Judge Barbara A. Lane said: "It is not the 
proper role of the courts to substitute our judgment for that of the people and 
their local representatives." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit brought by nine plaintiffs, including Los Angeles County and the 
cities of Los Angeles, Malibu and Calabasas, seeks to reopen the environmental 
review process. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County supervisors approved the 3,050-home project on condition that 
Ahmanson Land Co. first acquire and turn over 10,000 acres to federal and state 
parks agencies. Only about 3,000 acres have so far been turned over to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Trigg, spokeswoman for Ahmanson Ranch, said the developer expects to 
remain in a holding pattern until the courts resolve the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not surprised that there would be an appeal," Trigg said. "We want to 
concentrate on getting the litigation behind us before we go forward with 
anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Vose said he expects the other plaintiffs will file papers with the 2nd 
District Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 For Calabasas, which has already spent about $120,000 battling the unpopular 
project, the appeal will cost another $25,000, City Manager Charles Cate said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in this far already, we might as well press on," he said. KURT PITZER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; MERCHANTS WANTED FOR BUSINESS WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As an eye doctor, Dr. Barry Leonard has seen it plenty of times before: people 
complaining about a problem, but then finding some excuse to duck their meeting 
with him. To Leonard, it's part of the business. 
</P>
<P>
 But as president of the Van Nuys Boulevard Business Watch, Leonard is tired of 
excuses for missing his group's meetings, which need more merchants to identify 
and eradicate blight, crime and eyesores along the thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're knocking on doors trying to get people," said Leonard, who will hold 
his next meeting at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday in the seventh-floor classroom of 
Valley Hospital Medical Center, 14500 Sherman Circle, Van Nuys. "People have 
got to get out there and yell and complain." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the hundreds of businesses along Sepulveda Boulevard, Leonard said there 
are about 20 that have become core members of his business watch since its 
founding in June. 
</P>
<P>
 But that small group has accomplished much, Leonard said. Several have 
improved their security, and the group has altered pay phones along the 
boulevard so that they do not accept callbacks, foiling beeper-equipped drug 
dealers and prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard said his monthly business watch meetings also offer a chance to 
discuss neighborhood crime problems with senior officers from the Los Angeles 
Police Department's Van Nuys station. Wednesday's meeting will be such an 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one of the officers will be bilingual because many of the merchants 
along Van Nuys are Spanish-speaking, Leonard said. Leonard is also searching 
for a Korean translator. 
</P>
<P>
 To him, it is a matter of pooling as many people as possible to make the 
boulevard a better place to work and shop. "It's in the best interest of the 
businesses to keep clients coming in their area by promoting the safety of 
anybody in the vicinity." JEFF SCHNAUFER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: ANDREW YOUNG TO SPEAK AT CSUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Civil rights leader Andrew Young, who last month urged Cal State Northridge 
students to see the earthquake "not as something to be spurned, but as an 
opportunity," has accepted an invitation to deliver the honors convocation 
address at the university in early June. 
</P>
<P>
 The former mayor of Atlanta and U. S. ambassador to the United Nations is vice 
chairman of Law Companies Group Inc., an engineering and environmental services 
firm working on the CSUN campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators have asked Young, who also served three terms in Congress and 
was a top aide to Martin Luther King Jr., to speak about the importance of the 
human spirit in overcoming adversity. 
</P>
<P>
 "In life you have to deal with the imperfect," said Bruce Erickson, a CSUN 
spokesman. "He was beat up, he was jailed. . . . He said those experiences 
prepared him for his position as ambassador and mayor." 
</P>
<P>
 The annual honors convocation recognizes students for their academic 
achievements and outstanding contributions to the university. The ceremony, for 
about 1,000 students and their guests, will be open to the public. It will take 
place at the University Club on June 5, kicking off three days of commencement 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 For the estimated 7,000 CSUN seniors who will graduate less than six months 
after their campus suffered what is believed to be the costliest natural 
disaster ever at a U. S. university, the ceremonies are likely to be 
unforgettable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not your normal commencement," said Kaine Thompson, a spokeswoman for 
the university. "It's like we all came through this together and survived."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; TAFT WINNERS RETURN HOME TO CHEERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The airport waiting area at LAX was transformed into a sea of red and yellow. 
There were balloons, carnations, banners, and school shirts all singing the 
praises of Taft High School in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The assembled group of student government leaders eagerly waited for American 
Airlines Flight 43 from Newark N.J., which carried their schoolmates who won 
the 13th annual U.S. Academic Decathlon. The group made as much noise as the 
planes overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say number, you say one!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Number -- " 
</P>
<P>
 "One!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Number -- " 
</P>
<P>
 "One!"  
</P>
<P>
 So went the call-and-response cheering that transformed the concourse into a 
pep rally as about two dozen students greeted the winning decathletes. 
</P>
<P>
 The faculty adviser for the student leaders had planned the airport rally last 
week, no matter how the team finished. 
</P>
<P>
 As the cheering continued, another group of supporters showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ditched school to come see our friends," said 18-year-old senior Hilla 
Shprung. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilla and about five others said they had to take an English test early so 
they could come to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Zankan, the student body historian, arrived but without her camera 
that had broken earlier that morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a good year for us," said Jennifer. "My scrapbook's full." As for 
pictures, she said she'd rely on newspaper photos. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Fields, 17 and Shauna Howard, 18, came to welcome their best friend 
and team member, senior Kimberly Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks earlier, the three had spent part of their spring break 
vacationing in Palm Springs. For Kimberly, it was a needed respite from long 
hours of study. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if you relax part of the time and you're not stressing out 
completely, you perform better," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberly's philosophy proved smart as she captured a gold medal in the speech 
category and finished third among 175 students in the B grade-point average 
group. She also netted a $2,000 scholarship, one of many for the Taft students. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Salter, who finished as the second-smartest student overall behind 
teammate Daniel Berdichevsky, was the first to greet the crowd.  
</P>
<P>
 Andrew held up the winning trophy as others waved California state flags 
before cheering fans. Daniel said that being crowned the best high school 
academic in the nation among students with A averages would afford him certain 
perks. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the next few weeks and probably for a long time, I'm going to be the 
happiest person in the city," Daniel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, his ultimate goal was "to be a member of the number-one team 
in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Shaw, 16, and the team's only junior, didn't know if he'd compete next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't really thought about it," Stephen said. "Right now, I'm feeling an 
extreme high." 
</P>
<P>
 Sage Vaughn, a senior, received hugs and kisses from his girlfriend and from 
his best friend who announced he was throwing a Monday night party in Sage's 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sage, a self-described underachiever and one of the team's three C students, 
said he was coerced into joining the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The college counselor and my history teacher saw my potential and talked me 
into trying out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After completing a journey that began nine months ago, the champions left the 
national competition having recorded the highest score in the history of the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this kind of challenge can bring out the best in everyone," Andrew 
said. TERESA ANN WILLIS

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; JOBS CAMPAIGN NETS TWO NEW BUSINESSES

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. headquarters for a multinational insurance company and a 
Hollywood-based radio station are moving to Burbank in June, said city 
officials who, for the past year, have been running an active campaign to bring 
jobs to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank offered $250,000 in tax rebates to Allianz Insurance -- which is based 
in Germany and has offices in downtown Los Angeles, Woodland Hills and Glendale 
-- and $50,000 to KIIS Radio, now on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 KIIS Radio, with about 60 employees, will move its offices to Studio Plaza in 
June. Allianz Insurance plans to bring the 320 employees now working in the 
area to Riverside Drive in a building owned by Sony Pictures Entertainment 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The recruitment of the two companies caps the first year of an economic 
incentive program that started in March, 1993, with the aim of restoring jobs 
to Burbank. The city lost about 15,000 workers when Lockheed Corp. began a 
pullout in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the economic incentive program has created 444 new jobs for the city 
and kept the employers of another 336 workers from leaving. The program has 
used a variety of incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Herco, an industrial supply company in Burbank for 45 years, had 
considered leaving town until the Burbank City Council helped finance 
improvements to another site in the city that Herco moved into. In another 
example, the city guaranteed a $100,000 loan for another company that wanted to 
expand. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of these deals really costs us any money," said James O'Neil, special 
assistant to the Burbank community development director. O'Neil said that by 
helping businesses expand or move into the city, revenues from sales and 
property taxes are boosted. The incentives have helped lure companies that 
would have gone elsewhere and kept businesses in the city that had been 
seriously considering moving, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of the deals -- like a $20,000 loan to a marketing research firm 
approved by the City Council earlier this month -- are financial, some of the 
incentives are simpler, like solving a parking problem for companies that would 
otherwise move out of town, O'Neil said. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the city financial packages -- either tax rebates, forgivable loans or 
loan guarantees for companies -- total nearly $800,000 in the first year of the 
economic incentive program, which averages out to about $1,000 per employee. ED

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: STUDENT VOLUNTEER PROGRAM PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale Community College students interested in teaching, police work or 
city management could get hands-on experience through a proposed volunteer 
program involving the college, the city and the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 Community college officials have asked the Glendale Unified School District 
and the city of Glendale to join them in applying for a $131,579 grant from the 
Corp. for National and Community Service in Washington, D. C. 
</P>
<P>
 Using grant money, the district would hire a part-time program coordinator to 
place between 150 and 200 students in tutoring and mentoring jobs with at-risk 
junior high students, said Fred Wells, coordinator of the volunteer center at 
Glendale Community College. 
</P>
<P>
 Students interested in working at the city -- which would also hire a 
part-time coordinator -- could volunteer in the police community services 
bureau or with the neighborhood services department, said Madalyn Blake, 
director of community development and housing in a report to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Grants for the joint effort are available through the National Community 
Service and Trust Act signed into law by President Clinton last fall. The act 
encourages colleges to create volunteer programs -- in part to allow students 
to work off college expenses through volunteering. 
</P>
<P>
 Community college students will have a tough time participating in this aspect 
of the program because volunteering to pay off college loans requires 900 hours 
of volunteer time over a three-year period to receive $2,300, Wells said. A 
majority of community college students spend two years in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells said the volunteer center at Glendale Community College was opened 
several months ago because of an increased number of students asking for help 
in finding volunteer positions. Grant money would be used to fund the center's 
activities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has become popular because volunteer positions provide students 
with valuable insight into career goals and may also open the door for job 
opportunities, Wells said.  
</P>
<P>
 If Glendale Community College receives the grant, it will be only the third 
community college in the nation to devise an organized volunteer program, Wells 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will consider the request at today's meeting. Board of 
Education members will review the proposal tonight. JENNIFER OLDHAM

VALLEY INTERVIEW: HAMPERED BY A LACK OF FACTS ON TROUBLED LANCASTER PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Phil Sneiderman, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As chairman of the citizens advisory committee for the new state prison in 
Lancaster, James T. Lott just wrapped up a nightmarish year. 
</P>
<P>
 Before it opened on Feb. 1, 1993, Lancaster activists fought hard to keep the 
$207-million prison from being built. Shortly after it opened, Warden Otis 
Thurman appointed Lott to the 15-member panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, during the prison's first 11 months, two minimum-security and two 
maximum-security inmates escaped. All four were recaptured, but community anger 
escalated. When Thurman refused to speak publicly about the escapes, many 
residents directed their questions at Lott, a 57-year-old administrator with 
the Keppel Union School District in Littlerock. In February, state officials 
removed Thurman, but Lott remains on the advisory panel, awaiting the arrival 
of a new warden. 
</P>
<P>
 Lott was interviewed by Times staff writer Phil Sneiderman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Did you oppose construction of a new state prison in Lancaster?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I had no position at all. I remember reading about it. But I didn't 
have enough information to be either for it or against it. All I knew was that 
whatever they put in there, they better try to keep the inmates in and the 
community safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What were your first impressions of Warden Thurman?  
</P>
<P>
 A. At the first interview, he was very concerned about making sure that the 
prison was a safe place to work and that the community was safe. I got the 
impression that he liked to give his staff a lot of autonomy, to give them the 
opportunity to do their job and to trust them. I think he delegated an awful 
lot of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Did he regret that management style after Eric Rene Johnson, a convicted 
murderer, escaped last October by climbing over a wall and two fences?  
</P>
<P>
 A. I watched him after that escape. There was some worry on his face. I got 
the impression that he wished he would have handled things a little 
differently. He was in awe as to how the escape happened. It bothered him. He 
made the statement, "I know we can do better than this. If anything else 
happens, I'm really going to consider being out of here." 
</P>
<P>
 I guess part of that escape was something mechanical, about the fence not 
clamping the guy in or something. But that wasn't a good enough excuse for us. 
For someone to escape, there's a human error. Someone failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Lancaster got this prison not because the community wanted it but because 
the state Legislature ordered one built in north Los Angeles County . How did 
the warden feel about that?  
</P>
<P>
 A. I was under the impression that he felt that he was going to be the hero. 
He was going show us that we can have a prison here and that it can be safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. When the warden arrived, he was pretty visible, talking to a lot of 
community groups about the prison. Why didn't that continue?  
</P>
<P>
 A. After the escapes, he was so embarrassed and so disappointed that he just 
knew that people were going to go after him and blame him and not give him a 
chance to fix it because they didn't want it here in the first place. It kind 
of played right into their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 He had an avoidance role, which worked against him. He could have talked about 
what he was going to do to improve the prison and admitted that there were 
mistakes made. Instead, I think he got into a shell. The accessibility wasn't 
there. If a person called to talk to him, someone else would answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. As chairman of the advisory committee, did you have trouble getting in 
touch with the warden?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Once or twice I did. I was a little disappointed in his availability, 
particularly during the time of the escapes. When we would have our meetings 
there to discuss our concerns, he would have some representatives there. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Ideally, what role did you envision for the advisory committee?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Our role would be to offer suggestions to the warden, to support the warden 
and get feedback from the community on concerns about the prison -- and then 
work them out. Our role was to be the eyes of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 We were also concerned about how the prison was perceived by the community. 
When the first maximum-security inmate escaped, the Sheriff's Department wasn't 
called for hours, and the committee members were not called. The perception was 
that the prison was trying to hide something. I didn't want that perception. At 
an open meeting I said to the warden: "We better not have anything to hide out 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What was his response?  
</P>
<P>
 A. It was: "Oh, no, we don't have anything to hide here." Then we had another 
escape after that. The communication with the Sheriff's Department and the 
committee was better. But it should have been good all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. When Johnson escaped, why did it take so long for the prison staff to 
notify sheriff's deputies and the advisory committee?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Some people in the community believed that if somehow the prison staff 
could have found this guy and gotten him back in there without letting anyone 
know, they would have done that. That was the perception out there. 
</P>
<P>
 They have a process for notifying deputies and the committee, and I'm sure 
they were going to follow it. But I think that whoever was in charge at that 
time was so nervous about getting the guy back and making sure that nothing 
happened out there, that the notification took longer than it should have. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. After that escape, did the prison tighten up its security?  
</P>
<P>
 A. We were given a list of 53 recommendations, prepared by state corrections 
investigators, of things the prison staff should fix. It was a whole array of 
things, from more security to more workshops for the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 How could I go out and say it is going to be safe when I've got this many 
things wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What about the second maxi mum-security escape, when Steven Charles 
Brigada, serving a life sentence for attempted murder, slipped out in a garbage 
truck in January?  
</P>
<P>
 A. We were told that there were locks on the trash bins, when in fact there 
weren't. Now there are. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Before that escape, when your committee toured the prison, didn't someone 
ask the prison staff if inmates could get out in a trash bin?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Yes. The staff said, "No way. The bins have locks on them." After the 
escape they said that particular one was left open for dumping and they didn't 
lock it back up. It seemed to be just one thing after another -- a lack of 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What did prison investigators say about the second maximum-security escape? 
 
</P>
<P>
 A. They gave us 16 more things, in addition to the original 53, that needed to 
be fixed. It had to do with human error. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. As chairman of the committee, did the escapes put you in an awkward 
position?  
</P>
<P>
 A. I was in an awkward position for two reasons. If it had to do with prison 
personnel, there were some things we couldn't say. Secondly, we weren't given 
enough information to satisfy the community. We'd just say a little, and it 
would sound like we didn't know what we were talking about. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Were you surprised when the state removed the warden?  
</P>
<P>
 A. No. I was disappointed, though, that the warden was not as sensitive as I 
wanted him to be to our concerns. I think in his heart he meant well, and I 
think he trusted his staff to do well, but the people just didn't do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Were you surprised to learn that Lancaster's escape record was far worse 
than at most California prisons?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Yes. We heard reports at a Corrections Department convention that these 
escapes were part of growing pains, that this was common. I didn't buy into any 
of that. Either you're accountable or you're not accountable. If you make a 
mistake, admit it and try to correct it. You don't talk about growing pains 
being an excuse for people escaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Have you met yet with John Ratelle, the interim warden who took Thurman's 
place?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Yes. For one thing, he told me that no more trash trucks are going into the 
perimeter of the prison. I told him I wanted to know, as one member of the 
committee, what happened to the 53 recommendations that were made after the 
first maximum-security escape. He said he would look into that. We wanted 
progress reports, and we didn't get them. And we didn't get anything on the 16 
recommendations made after Brigada's escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Escapes aside, has the prison provided economic benefits to the community?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Yes. I think it has had a great impact on our economy here, especially in 
the wake of cutbacks in the aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How many local residents were hired by the prison?  
</P>
<P>
 A. We've asked for a report about the number of local employees, about how 
many employees are commuting from elsewhere as opposed to buying houses here, 
and how many local businesses are involved with the prison. We didn't get that 
report either. The interim warden said he is going to push for that one, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Have you accomplished much?  
</P>
<P>
 A. I think we let the community down. There was no protest when any of us was 
appointed to the committee. So when the community saw these names, they thought 
these were good people, that they would check things out and be fair because 
they have a track record. 
</P>
<P>
 Then all these things happened, and they came to us for information, and we 
didn't know anything. They think that we're part of the effort to hide 
something. One guy said maybe the prison needs to think about getting a new 
advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Would that help?  
</P>
<P>
 A. It wouldn't change anything.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 2 AGENCIES GET GRANTS FOR POST-QUAKE EFFORTS; 
PHILANTHROPY: PACIFIC BELL AWARDS A TOTAL OF $30,000 TO THE LOCAL SENIOR CENTER 
AND BOYS & GIRLS CLUB. 
</P>

<P>
 Two Santa Clarita agencies have been awarded $30,000 in earthquake relief 
funds for helping victims of the Northridge temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita Valley Senior Center will receive a $20,000 grant from 
Pacific Bell and $10,000 has been set aside for the Santa Clarita Boys & Girls 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a joy to find groups such as the Santa Clarita Valley Senior Center, who 
respond to the needs of the time," said Anita Gabrielian, Pacific Bell's public 
affairs manager, after announcing the award Monday to a crowd of more than 50 
senior citizens eating lunch at the Newhall senior center. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours after the Jan. 17 earthquake hit, center officials brought hundreds of 
gallons of water out of emergency storage and distributed it to the east 
Newhall community. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior center volunteers then visited about 160 senior citizens known to be 
housebound to make sure they were safe after the earthquake, said Brad Berens, 
executive director of the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake-related expenses have totaled about $40,000 for the center, and 
more than $100,000 will eventually be spent on counseling services for senior 
citizens, Berens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the senior center and the Boys & Girls Club facility, also in Newhall, 
were used as emergency American Red Cross shelters following the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell has awarded $1 million in earthquake relief grants of $5,000 to 
$60,000 to 21 Southern California agencies.  
</P>
<P>
 "The grants cover a range of programs, including building and repair, help for 
small businesses, housing relocation, counseling and legal advocacy for 
families and seniors," said Pacific Bell Vice President Gene Sherman. "Though 
we couldn't fund every agency that needed help, our intent was to identify 
service gaps and to support special community efforts that weren't receiving 
other forms of funding."

LEGISLATOR TO AID FOES OF SHELTER IN SAN PEDRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Pedro community leaders and local politicians have enlisted Rep. Jane 
Harman (D-Marina Del Rey) in their fight to stop a large homeless shelter from 
being set up in the city.  
</P>
<P>
 The shelter is expected to open on a 27-acre site on Taper Avenue after the 
Navy moves out this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman told a meeting of about 50 homeowners earlier this month that she may 
introduce amendments to the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. The 
legislation gives homeless programs priority on surplus federal land. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the act ought to be changed and I will work with the (Los Angeles) 
mayor and others to get it changed, but that doesn't do anything for this 
particular issue," Harman said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was her first meeting with the San Pedro community since controversy over 
the shelter began last month. More than 1,000 protesters gathered at several 
meetings to oppose a project they say would dramatically change their 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman brought with her Department of Health and Human Services representative 
Judy Breitman, who reviews applications for surplus federal land. 
</P>
<P>
 Breitman fielded questions about how a South-Central Los Angeles homeless 
advocacy group, Turner's Technical Institute, was given permission to use the 
Taper Avenue site and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the group had shown suitable experience and the ability to apply for 
program funding and "we had no reason to disapprove it." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is not unique to San Pedro, she said. Other communities are angry 
about bases being transferred under the McKinney Act because the law does not 
allow for public discussion of the applications. Approval of the shelter does 
not mean it will be on the site forever, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under department regulations, Turner's must have its program running in a 
year, provide a written report to the department every year and undergo on-site 
checks every three to five years, Breitman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been some properties that have come back to us because they 
couldn't get the funding or couldn't overcome the opposition," Breitman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Rae Brown told the meeting that the Turner's homeless 
program cannot begin until it meets city zoning regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city's planning process requires public hearings. You have at that time 
the chance to bring forward your concerns again," Brown said. Turner's has not 
yet applied for a zoning permit, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council was expected to approve four recommendations by Councilman 
Rudy Svorinich Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations, agreed to unanimously at a meeting of the council's 
Intergovernmental Relations Committee earlier this month, would allow the city 
to join lobbying efforts to ensure that the community is consulted on future 
decisions about federal surplus land. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Housing and Urban Development Department, which approves sites 
as suitable for use by the homeless, is assessing the site for a second time to 
determine whether it meets legal guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Two privately owned tanks containing millions of gallons of aviation fuel are 
within 2,000 feet of the site's 24 buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although opposition to the project is growing, Turner's has no plan to give up 
its application, director John Marzet said. However, Turner's will continue to 
work with Svorinich's office to find an alternative site, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents are looking for any way to kill the project, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you suffer from economic disaster in your life, we don't want you to live 
next door to us -- that's what they're saying," Marzet said recently. "It's 
discrimination."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; HEIDT GETS A LOOK AT WORK ON RAIL LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Clarita City Councilwoman Jan Heidt got a firsthand look Monday at work 
being done on Metrolink tracks that is expected to halve the commuting time 
from the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys to Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scope of work out there has been tremendous," said Heidt, who also serves 
as an alternate Metrolink board member."It will make a big impact on commuter 
rail." 
</P>
<P>
 Since February, workers have been installing state-of-the-art signals and 
straightening parts of the 50-mile stretch of tracks in use since the 
Northridge earthquake to provide immediate train service to Antelope Valley and 
Canyon Country commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironing out the curves in the railway will allow Metrolink trains to travel at 
normal speeds, reducing travel time for commuters by up to 45 minutes. The 
78-mile trip from Lancaster to Los Angeles now takes an hour and 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be traveling at considerably faster speeds," Metrolink 
spokesman Peter Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Funded by $25 million in earthquake-related grants from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, the improvements are expected to be completed by late June. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Metrolink will continue to offer special discount fares 
through June to Antelope Valley commuters, who can receive half off monthly 
passes, and Santa Clarita commuters, who can get a 25% discount. That means, 
for example, that a monthly pass from Lancaster to Los Angeles is going for 
$104, compared with the regular $208 fare. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo also ridership has been growing since the Jan. 17 quake, when trains 
carried 1,000 commuters from the north county in contrast to the 8,000 
travelers now riding daily. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our ridership continues to hold," Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>

 Some things are so disgusting, it's only a matter of time before they become 
really popular. So it is with what Arizona police and wildlife officials call 
the latest fad to sweep the drug culture -- toad smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it's done: You grab a Sonoran Desert toad, an easy task since they 
don't move very fast, and squeeze the glands near its eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty soon, the glands pop and out oozes a milky substance with the 
consistency of rubber cement and a chemical makeup similar to LSD. You let this 
blob dry on glass, cut off a piece, stuff it into a pipe and fire it up. 
</P>
<P>
 "A man was arrested for this in California and he described the high," said 
Don Mattus of the Arizona Fish and Game Department. "He said it's a 20-minute 
trip so intense that he can hear electrons jumping orbitals in his molecules." 
</P>
<P>
 Achieving this mental state is not only illegal but also dangerous -- to toad 
and human -- some experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattus explained that toad smoking is akin to the even more repulsive toad 
licking, a popular practice in the '60s that's making a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are things people seem to be experimenting with right now," Mattus 
said. "They think it's cool because it's gross. What could be more gross than 
licking a toad?" 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona police don't know the extent of the trend, but two recent cases seem 
to indicate a growing interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, a Tucson man was arrested when authorities discovered 62 
desert toads in his home. Arizona law forbids the sale of native wildlife, but 
anyone with a fishing license may legally possess up to 10 desert toads. The 
man, who claimed the amphibians were pets, was charged with numerous counts of 
illegally possessing and transporting wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 The other case involved a University of Arizona student arrested after he ran 
an ad in the student newspaper soliciting desert toads, also called Colorado 
River toads. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildlife experts at first assumed these cases were part of the ongoing trade 
in which collectors ship exotic desert animals to black-market dealers, usually 
in Florida, Texas and California. Then the Arizona officials learned of the 
February arrest of a California man for possession of bufotenine, a 
hallucinogenic chemical secreted by the toads. The man came clean with his 
intention to smoke the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent publicity surrounding toad smoking has resulted in numerous calls, most 
originating in California, to Dr. Andrew Weil from people asking how they can 
get toads. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are smoking them, but I can't tell you how extensive it is," 
said Weil, a University of Arizona ethnopharmacologist and drug culture expert. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, no toad-smoking arrests have been made here, where bufotenine is listed 
as a dangerous drug under state control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think law enforcement was even aware this fad was going on until 
recently," said Lt. Dave Gonzales of the Department of Public Safety. "If a cop 
in a rural area came upon a man with a bunch of toads, he'd just assume he was 
collecting toads. Nobody's going to admit to smoking a toad." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sonoran Desert toad is found only in south and south-central Arizona and 
northern Mexico, and wildlife officials fear that if the trend grows, the 
region will see an influx of toad hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 A good desert toad, which runs up to eight inches long and weighs up to two 
pounds, yields $8 to $10 on California's drug market, wildlife officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizonans usually notice the critters during the summer, when their back yards 
fill with the rhythmic chorus of toads singing to attract mates and when dogs 
make the mistake of catching and biting them. The dog may respond with symptoms 
ranging from excessive salivation and diarrhea to paralysis and respiratory 
collapse, and may even die. 
</P>
<P>
 "The toad possesses a whole package of chemicals to make it distasteful to 
predators," Lawler said. "Bufotenine is found in all toads, but the Sonoran 
Desert toad also has dimethyltryptamine. These two together work as quite a 
hallucinogenic compound." 
</P>
<P>
 The risks to people are considerable. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with getting high off toads, or any organic source, is the wide 
variation in dosage, said Jude McNally of the University of Arizona's poison 
and drug information center. "Even someone who thinks he has experience with it 
doesn't know what he's getting," McNally said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weil said he has smoked toad twice and knows others who have done so hundreds 
of times, and they came out all right. "It looks relatively safe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lawler believes using it amounts to playing toad roulette. And he fears 
that the fad might injure the desert toad, which already suffers from an "if 
it's ugly and it hops, kill it" prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt this will catch on in a big way," he said, "but you never know."

PERSONAL HEALTH; KEEPING KIDS OFF THE DISABLED LIST

<P>
 While big-league baseball fans fret over traded players and those gone AWOL, 
parents of littler leaguers fear trips to the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, youth baseball and softball, played by nearly 5 million children 5 
years to 14 years old, are relatively safe, according to the American Academy 
of Pediatrics.Only about 2% to 8% of players are injured each year, according 
to the academy's Committee on Sports Medicine and Fitness. 
</P>
<P>
 Most injuries are minor and involve the face or arms. Serious and chronically 
disabling injuries are rare, the academy said, and do not seem to be 
increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, there are about three deaths each year -- most due to chest impact or 
head and neck injuries, according to statistics from the U.S. Consumer Product 
Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 To increase safety, the academy has issued guidelines, suggesting: 
</P>
<P>
 * Players wear protective gear, such as batting helmets and rubber spikes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Catchers wear a catcher's helmet, mask and chest and neck protectors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Players with a history of eye problems should wear eye protectors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Children younger than 10, generally not as skilled as older children, should 
be encouraged to use low-impact balls. 
</P>
<P>
 * Players younger than 10 should avoid head-first sliding. 
</P>
<P>
 * Players should get instruction in proper biomechanics to reduce the risk of 
throwing injuries. KATHLEEN DOHENY

SMART CYCLING; TEACH KIDS TO RIDE, GIVE THEM HELMETS, AND THEY'RE READY FOR THE 
ROAD, RIGHT? WRONG. THEY NEED SAFETY RULES, TOO.

 There he was, still wet from the ocean, gliding along on his beach cruiser 
bicycle, enjoying about as fine a day as a 14-year-old surfer can. 
</P>
<P>
 The waves had been good. The morning sun was bright. The breeze was gentle. 
</P>
<P>
 Now if only he had noticed the stop sign. Or the two police officers sitting 
half a block away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, please, sir, don't give me a ticket," the high school freshman begged 
after Huntington Beach Police Officer Bert Adkins waved him over and pulled out 
his citation book. "I'll do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 What the young cyclist will do if he wants to avoid the fine or court 
appearance for running a stop sign is attend a bicycle traffic school. With a 
parent. On a Saturday morning, no less. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of fuss over a wayward bicyclist? Not at all, say safety experts who 
study childhood injuries. Any time a child or young teen-ager enters a street 
or driveway, whether by foot or bicycle, there is no such thing as too much 
caution, the experts add. 
</P>
<P>
 Bicycle injuries are the leading cause of serious injuries in children ages 5 
to 14, researchers at the University of California, Irvine, say. Pedestrian 
injuries are the leading cause of preventable death in children 4 to 8. More 
than half the victims are boys, the National Safety Council says. 
</P>
<P>
 California's much-publicized helmet law is expected to reduce injuries, but 
even helmets can't prevent the accidents that get children into trouble in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
 The specific accidents vary by age group, but researchers list the same 
underlying causes: overestimating a kid's street smarts and physical abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies have found that many parents agree that 6-year-olds aren't capable of 
crossing a street alone, yet allow their own 6-year-olds to cross the street 
because they are, of course, responsible kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the Lake Wobegon effect," said Linda Tracy, project manager for the 
Bicycle Federation of America. "You always think that your child is above 
average." 
</P>
<P>
 And bikes are sold in toy stores, after all. But how many toys share the road? 
</P>
<P>
 "We spend quite a bit of time teaching them how to ride a bike and how to get 
going, but then we forget to teach them the safety rules with it. They are not 
little adults," said Diane Winn, associate director of UC Irvine's Pediatric 
Injury Prevention Research Group. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you think about it, we don't allow other people to go out into the 
street and interact with traffic until they're 16 years of age and have passed 
a course." 
</P>
<P>
 Winn's studies have found that preteens are as likely to be injured as 
preschoolers. The scenarios are certainly different, but the arena is the same 
-- the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all feel comfortable in our own immediate neighborhood. We need this to 
function. You can't always be worrying about your safety. There's a natural 
letdown in our own environment in the way we supervise our children," Winn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The same character traits that help children learn about their world -- 
spontaneity and curiosity -- are also their greatest pitfalls in street safety, 
she added. "They're curious. They're exploring. We overestimate how they'll 
behave." 
</P>
<P>
 But behaving, or minding rules and heeding parental harangues, is only part of 
what is required. At various ages, it is simply impossible for a child to 
master all the skills needed to safely cross a street or maneuver a bicycle 
past deceivingly quiet driveways. It's like asking a 2-year-old to hold a 
pencil steady and print his name. It just can't be done. 
</P>
<P>
 The best prevention is for parents to know what children can and can't do at 
various ages, safety experts say. They offer specific guidelines: 
</P>
<P>
 * Time and distance are fuzzy concepts for preschoolers. They forget to "come 
right back" or get easily distracted and go squeak-squeak-squeaking away on 
their tricycles because they think home must just be another house away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get a lot of kids who get lost on their Big Wheels," said Adkins, the 
police officer. "We find them two hours later two miles from the house. God 
knows how many driveways they've crossed or how many streets they've crossed." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents are advised to stick with them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kids 5 and 6 years old can't be taught to safely cross a street, Winn said. 
They don't have the full field of vision that adults have. Moreover, they can't 
master the synchronization -- stopping, looking, listening, watching and 
looking again -- required to get across a street. 
</P>
<P>
 Most likely, though, they are hit because they have decided to zip over to 
visit a friend they've just spotted or have darted out for a ball. The 
decisions are made on a whim. Kids can't shift from play mode to street 
alertness. 
</P>
<P>
 Front-yard play should be supervised and streets should be made off-limits 
without exception. 
</P>
<P>
 * Children 7 and older usually can handle crossing in crosswalks if they have 
learned how from parents, Winn said. The American Bicycle Federation says 
children 9 and older can begin bicycling in the streets, if they've had proper 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 School and police department safety programs are helpful, but parents also 
need to teach, drill and test their children. Cross streets together at least 
100 times before you let a child try it solo. Bicycle the route to school or 
soccer practice together. What might be simple on foot can be much more 
complicated on a bike, Adkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the biggest mistakes is not sitting down with the children and showing 
them safe routes to school," Adkins said. "If (parents) check the routes, 
they'll find out there are a lot of hazards along the way." 
</P>
<P>
 The best bet is practice, practice and more practice. 
</P>
<P>
 * Finally, enforce the rules, Adkins said. He helped start Huntington Beach's 
bicycle citation and traffic school program six years ago in response to a high 
number of juvenile bike accidents in the city. It's not all crime and 
punishment. Prizes are given to kids "caught doing something right." 
</P>
<P>
 But violators are ticketed. With the first two violations, kids 15 and younger 
can make amends in the $10 bicycle traffic school. A parent or grandparent's 
attendance is required. (After that, there is a fine or court appearance.) The 
result is that juvenile bicycle accidents are down. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the city's new bicycle problem isn't with juveniles. It's with 
adults cycling for recreation or to build endurance and speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're as bad as the kids. They have radios on their ears, they go into 
traffic," Adkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 The adults have one tendency even the kids avoid, though: They crash into 
parked cars.

IF FRIENDS LEND A HAND, IT'S NO HANDOUT; FOR ITS 10TH ANNUAL TASTE, SUPPORTERS 
OF IRVINE TEMPORARY HOUSING TRY FINE DINING AT THE MARRIOTT. 
</P>

<P>
 Irvine Temporary Housing celebrated its 10th anniversary Saturday by turning 
its annual all-you-can-eat food fest, Taste of Irvine, into an elegant evening 
of fine dining. 
</P>
<P>
 At previous tastes, Friends of Irvine Temporary Housing would invite guests to 
wander from table to table indulging in specialties prepared by local 
restaurants. For its 10th annual taste, the Friends decided to hold a fancy 
sit-down dinner prepared by the Irvine Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
 At this year's "Celebrate the Taste," about 200 guests enjoyed lamb, swordfish 
and beef with peppercorn sauce at tables adorned with ivy-covered topiaries set 
up in a voluminous white tent at the hotel. The $85-per-person gala was 
expected to net $15,000 for Irvine Temporary Housing, which provides shelter 
for the homeless. Worlds Turned Upside-Down 
</P>
<P>
 At first, an affluent, master-planned community such as Irvine seems an 
unlikely place to have a homeless problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people think of the homeless, many think of people out on the street," 
said Ann Dean, president and board chairman of Irvine Temporary Housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's homeless problem is less visible but very real, Dean said. Residents 
there might appear to be well-off, but their finances can be stretched thin due 
to high mortgages and credit card bills. When catastrophe strikes, such as 
illness not covered by insurance, divorce or loss of job, even families that 
appeared to have it all can lose their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say most of us are just a couple of paychecks away" from being homeless, 
Dean said. "You can have this nice, neat little life, then something can turn 
your neat little world right on its head." Helping Themselves 
</P>
<P>
 Since its inception 10 years ago, Irvine Temporary Housing has provided 
shelter for 170 Irvine families and offered additional support services for 
more than 8,000 Orange County residents annually. The agency assists both the 
homeless and families on the verge of losing their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Temporary Housing owns two condominiums and leases eight apartments and 
two rehabilitated farmhouses to use for shelters. Families pay a reduced rent 
to live in one of the units, staying an average of 90 days to six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Housing is the cornerstone of the program. We can't get the families' 
attention unless that basic need is taken care of," said Margie Wakeham, 
executive director of Irvine Temporary Housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Clients must undergo counseling provided by the agency so they learn to live 
within a budget, handle stress, develop parenting skills, shop for low-priced 
food and develop other skills to become self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get stressed out, you can't even put a meal together," said Pat 
Carlyle, event co-chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the agency operates a food pantry and clothing closet for needy 
Orange County residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hand up, not a hand out," Carlyle said. "These are people in 
transition. They could be your neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the guests were Suzan Langlois, event co-chairwoman; Lydia Tyler, 
president of Friends of Irvine Temporary Housing; Ed and Teresa Belfanti, Jim 
and Janet Colclaser, Keith and Elaine Greer, Dave and Joyce Gwidt, Jim and 
Joanne Hale, Carol Hoffman, Larry and Phyllis Hogle, Kevin Shamlou and 
Christine Shea, David and Susan Sills, Dick and Ann Sim, John and Renee 
Simonis, Franco and Lisa Vessia, Alan and Barbara Wiener, Dennis and Jamie 
Wilkinson and Bob and Carolyn Williams. KATHRYN BOLD

WHAT KIDS CAN AND CAN'T DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Think your 5-year-old can cross the street? Can your 7-year-old bicycle to 
school? Think again. Parents tend to overestimate their children's street 
smarts, safety experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 5-year-olds cannot: 
</P>
<P>
 * Judge speed or distance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Understand why the driver of a car can't see them if they can see the car. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quickly realize the direction from which the sound of a car is coming. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stop play momentum in time to focus on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 6-to-8-year-olds cannot: 
</P>
<P>
 * Consistently judge speeds and distances of oncoming cars. 
</P>
<P>
 * Control a big bike bought for them to "grow into." 
</P>
<P>
 * Plan a good route to their destination by bike or foot, or find a safe 
crossing place on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 * Balance, steer, stop and start a bike and pay attention to the street 
traffic, other cyclists and even parked cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Preteens and adolescents: 
</P>
<P>
 * Underestimate traffic and the amount of time it takes vehicles to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Forget" that bicyclists are subject to same laws -- and traffic fines -- as 
all vehicles on the road.

SOUTH AFRICA / FORGING A NATION; DAWNING OF A DEMOCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Political analysts expect the African National Congress to win in South 
Africa's first all-race elections next week, ending more than three centuries 
of white domination. The gears of government will change as well, reflecting 
the nation's commitment to democracy. Here's how it will work. They'll Choose a 
Party, Not a Candidate 
</P>
<P>
 Voters will mark paper ballots designating the party of their choice. More 
than 25 parties will contest the elections. The important Inkatha Freedom Party 
is boycotting. The mainstream parties: African National Congress 
</P>
<P>
 Origin and policies: The African National Congress is a multiracial 
organization formed in 1912 to fight for the rights of the country's black 
majority. Its first years were devoted to nonviolent resistance, but it began a 
campaign of sabotage in 1960 after the government declared it an illegal 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Stature: The ANC is the largest black-dominated political group in South 
Africa, and it is expected to score an overwhelming victory in the election. 
Its leader, Nelson Mandela, spent 27 years in prison for anti-apartheid 
activities before his release in 1990. He has led negotiations with the 
government on political reforms since then. National Party 
</P>
<P>
 Origin and policies: In power since 1948, and all-white until 1990, the 
National Party enacted laws decreeing where blacks, Asians and mixed-race 
Coloreds could live and work, and launched job programs for Afrikaners, the 
descendants of Dutch, German and French Huguenot settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Stature: South African President Frederik W. de Klerk insists that the 
National Party has changed, and is best equipped to lead a multiracial, 
economically viable South Africa. In 1990, a year after De Klerk took office, 
he opened negotiations with the ANC that will culminate with the April 26-28 
election. Inkatha Freedom Party 
</P>
<P>
 (boycotting the election, not on ballot) 
</P>
<P>
 Origin and policies: Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, chief minister of the 
KwaZulu black homeland, formed the first incarnation of Inkatha as a nonviolent 
anti-apartheid organization in the early 1970s. It was transformed into a 
political party in 1991 and became a key member of the Freedom alliance, a 
grouping of black conservatives and white rightists who say they need strong 
regional powers in a post-apartheid South Africa in order to avoid domination 
by the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
 Stature: The Zulu nationalist party has emerged as the main black rival to the 
ANC. It is closely tied to the Zulu monarchy, Buthelezi is the king's uncle and 
a chief himself, and claims to represent the 8.5 million South African Zulus, 
the nation's largest ethnic group. But the more broadly based ANC also has 
strong support among Zulus. Votes are counted two ways 
</P>
<P>
 NATIONALLY: 
</P>
<P>
 200 members of National Assembly chosen nationally, on proportional basis. For 
example, party getting 60% of vote gets 60% of seats. 
</P>
<P>
 NATIONAL ASSEMBLY: National Assembly picks the president of the republic, who 
will be the leader of the party receiving the most votes. 
</P>
<P>
 CABINET: Up to 27 Cabinet ministers, who will run day-to-day operations, are 
chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 SENATE: Senate president to be elect by members 
</P>
<P>
 The two houses, Senate and National Assembly, must pass a permanent 
constitution in time for 1999 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 REGIONALLY: 
</P>
<P>
 Votes divided proportionally among parties in the nine new regions 
</P>
<P>
 ...to elect the other 200 members of the National Assembly 
</P>
<P>
 ...and to elect new regional government 
</P>
<P>
 Changing boundaries: South Africa will be divided into nine new provinces, 
each with its own legislature. The boundaries of the nine new provinces may 
change in post-election referendums.

 All constitutional matters will be handled by a new 11-person constitutional 
court. It will help enforce the new bill of rights and settle disputes between 
the provinces and national government. 
</P>
<P>
 The new bill of right guarantees all South Africans 
</P>
<P>
 * Have the right to vote 
</P>
<P>
 * Can move and live where they want 
</P>
<P>
 * Cannot be detained without trial

<P>
 * On arrest, have right to remain silent and the right to a lawyer To 
understand South Africa, it helps to understand: 
</P>
<P>
 * Apartheid: Government-sanctioned segregation of the nation's racial and 
ethnic groups. Exclusive voting rights enabled the nation's 5 million whites to 
control and rule a nation of 41 million. Many of the laws have been repealed 
and next week's elections will mark apartheid's last rites. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Homelands: A key tool of apartheid, the 10 homelands consist of 
scattered blocks of land set aside for South Africa's black populations. Four 
of them have been declared independent nations by the government, but other 
countries and the United Nations refused to recognize them. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Afrikaners: Consisting of 60% of the white population, these descendants 
of Dutch, German and French Huguenot settlers have been a major force behind 
past segregationist policies. They were primarily represented by the National 
Party. The party has now opened its membership to all races and pushed for 
multiracial constitutional reform. Right-wingers opposing National Party power 
sharing proposals formed the Conservative Party in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Zulus: The nation's largest ethnic group with 8.5 million members, some 
want a self-governing state and have refused to take part in the elections. 
Their Inkatha Freedom Party is boycotting the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 * What will happen to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Armed forces and police: There will be a single army and a centralized 
police force with some autonomy in the provinces. 
</P>
<P>
 * Land ownership: Interim constitution provides for restitution of land to the 
millions of blacks dispossessed since 1913. 
</P>
<P>
 * Taxes: They will be decided by the provinces, with national government 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 * The homelands: The will be eliminated. Ostensibly created to enhance tribal 
development, they aggravated ethnic tensions and served as dumping grounds for 
the unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 * The languages: There will be 11 official languages, including English and 
Afrikaans, a language developed from Dutch and used by Afrikaners. There are 
currently two official languages: English and Afrikaans. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whites: A separate white homeland will be considered after the elections, a 
demand of the white, right-wing Conservative Party. The nation and its people

 Three St. Louis-area apartment complexes have been charged by the Justice 
Department for alleged discrimination against African American renters.The 
suits charge that apartment owners and managers, all in a largely white section 
of St. Louis, "routinely refused to show units to black prospective tenants 
claiming they were unavailable." Meanwhile, whites were told the units were 
available. The apartment complexes face a civil penalty of up to $50,000 for 
the first violation and $100,000 for subsequent violations. About 15 cases were 
recently filed in five states as part of a 17-month nationwide investigation.

UNUSED RAIL LINE PERFECT FOR MTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * On April 1 you had a story on the unending saga of local mass transit, which 
is awaiting completion of further studies before any action can be taken. It 
dealt with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's lack of action securing 
federal fundings for a Valley rail line. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if action is taken by the MTA, it will be years before those of us who 
battle the Ventura Freeway in our daily struggle to get from home to work will 
see anything for the West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should we wait any longer? There is a perfectly good rail line that 
connects Chatsworth to Warner Center in Woodland Hills and from Warner Center 
parallels the Ventura Freeway all the way to Burbank. MTA already owns the 
tracks, and they are unused. Metrolink could be operating trains on this line 
tomorrow. As demonstrated by the quick action by Metrolink officials and 
others, the construction of brand-new Metrolink stations took only three to 12 
days to complete after the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not happening because MTA wants to keep the right of way for a 
possible-maybe- someday light rail line. Light rail is not the answer anyway. 
Speeds are limited to 55 m.p.h., whereas Metrolink trains reach speeds of 79 
m.p.h. today and have the potential of 110 m.p.h. with proper upgrades to the 
roadbed and installation of grade separations.

CRIME IS REAL ISSUE IN CITY NAME CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Scott Harris in his column "A Community in Search of a Reputation" (March 
20) and the writer of "Winnetka: Residents Seek to Change Area's Name" (March 
15) missed the point. 
</P>
<P>
 When any neighborhood puts energy into trying to keep itself safe from crime, 
it deserves praise. It should not be held up to ridicule.  
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not a name change is the way to go, the real issue of crime was 
deserving of discussion. I, for one, am disappointed.

CRIME FIGHTER REFUSES TO QUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * After being a victim of violent crime in my neighborhood, I chose to start 
Townkeepers Action Group, a much-needed and extremely effective organization. 
It is recognized by international, national, state and local media, and I have 
recently received a national award for the hard work and dedication put into 
the community to make it a better place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to clarify one thing: I do not just "sit at donut shops" as The Times 
suggests. This program goes much deeper, involving five long years of 
patrolling the streets, being politically active, holding monthly meetings on 
community issues, being a counselor and an educator for communities throughout 
Los Angeles and speaking at schools and functions. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't imagine that anyone would want to stop someone who has made a 
difference and has helped so many people and helped save lives, a lady who 
doesn't have her health on her side but is still determined to work practically 
around the clock without pay working with the police and the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides patrolling, I work with numerous organizations regarding crime, crime 
victims, illegal immigration and watchdog groups regarding numerous issues, to 
name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one conditions have been placed on a convenience store with the help of 
Townkeepers Action Group and others. Five motels have had 27 conditions imposed 
due to their lack of cooperation with the community. 
</P>
<P>
 These types of businesses have only themselves to blame. I declared this 
two-block area of Sepulveda Boulevard as a "war zone" due to out-of-control 
crime. Criminals don't keep returning to the same area unless there is a supply 
and a demand. The community and police have had enough. 
</P>
<P>
 I will continue this work. Crime does not pay when we all get involved 
together.

World in Orlando, Fla., and in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The commuter lines in Japan move lots and lots of people. They include the 
Kitakyushu Line, which carries 26,700 riders on an average day; the Shonan 
Line, 25,000; the Tuyonaka Line, 17,000; the Chiba City Line, 27,000, and the 
Tokyo Line, 115,000. These are major commuter lines that service a highly 
transit-dependent population. And monorails transport these passengers 
efficiently without the operational problems and noise associated with the 
underground and at-grade lines proposed for the Valley. These are some of the 
busiest transit corridors on earth. I have been there. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be fiscally irresponsible to advocate the construction of another 
subway system that would cost taxpayers $1 billion more than the locally 
preferred proposal. It would also be an affront to the communities concerned to 
expect them to endure the same mismanaged system that has devastated the 
communities through which this kind of construction has passed. A monorail 
would avoid the high water tables, toxic gases and underground obstructions, 
all which continue to plague the system now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 A monorail would be the best transit value for the San Fernando Valley, 
providing a transit solution for the next century.

HOOVER HIGH STILL A GREAT SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Recent events and pessimistic propaganda to which Glendale's Hoover High 
School has been subjected to have given the prestigious institution a 
disreputable image before the community. 
</P>
<P>
 ACT UP/LA's demonstration in front of the school was not only unnecessary and 
unsolicited, but also highly disruptive.The reading material that accompanied 
the contraceptives contained obscene, vulgar and almost pornographic literature 
not suitable for civilized people of any age. This junk was later found 
littered throughout the school's campus. Visitors will see this material fixed 
on windows, walls and lockers. 
</P>
<P>
 Who will compensate the school for the time and money that will be employed to 
the renovation of our once-immaculate campus? It will certainly not be the AIDS 
Coalition to Unleash Power. 
</P>
<P>
 The racial tensions that have been noticeable between Latino and Armenian 
gangs reached a new climax days after ACT UP/LA's demonstration. Although these 
events were not related, they did serve a similar objective: Stain Hoover's 
image. A local television channel (KABC 7) reported gunshots on the brawl 
scene, when in fact none were fired. Guns were not even anywhere on the scene, 
but in order to make the report interesting, misinforming facts were thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover High is a superior learning institution, the envy of many national 
school districts. We have a minimal dropout/truancy rate, excellent 
administrators/teachers, prestigious clubs and no crime. Students attending 
Hoover did not participate in either of the two disturbances, a fact that will 
serve as reassurance to the community. Hoover is still the prestigious 
institution it has always been. Nothing has changed or is expected to change.

PRAISE AND THANKS FOR DWP WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Department of Water and Power has been in the news lately and I would 
like to add my two cents' worth. However, mine is praise and thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 22, the fifth day after the earthquake, I did not have electricity. 
About 7:30 a.m. I spotted men in orange helmets in the alley behind my house 
near Balboa Boulevard and Rinaldi Street in Granada Hills. I ran outside and 
told one of the men my husband had gone to work for the Gas Co. The huge truck 
from the DWP rumbled over the broken blocks and bricks in the alley and began 
working on the equipment near my house. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7:41 a.m. I saw a light go on in my kitchen. Still standing in the back 
yard and overcome by emotion, I began to cry. The kindly worker put his arm 
around me and asked me if I would be OK. Assuring him that I would be all 
right, but still crying, I managed a smile. He went back into the house with me 
to make sure everything was working and to check on my sons.  
</P>
<P>
 The rescue workers, of course, warrant praise, but let us not forget the 
blue-collar workers with DWP, the gas company, the phone companies. It was a 
monumental task, and they just went about their business and put in long, hard, 
tedious hours.

$15,000 A BARGAIN FOR POET ANGELOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Thanks to all those at CSUN for bringing poet Maya Angelou to the 
"epicenter" to speak on March 17. 
</P>
<P>
 While the university has been criticized for spending $15,000 for this 
remarkable woman's time (Letters, March 21), I contend that $15,00 was a 
bargain.But then I was there. 
</P>
<P>
 I was there with my 10-year-old daughter, a dear friend and a capacity crowd 
as Ms. Angelou performed CPR on our collective soul, offering us hope and 
strength and love and laughter. And while it is true that she never once 
mentioned the value of a dollar, Ms. Angelou held us spellbound as she reminded 
us of the value of the human spirit. No money was raised, only consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen thousand dollars for Maya Angelou? Ask anyone who was there -- it was 
a bargain.

MYSTERY WOMAN RESTORES FAITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * My faith in the human race has been validated because on April 7 I left my 
purse in a cart at Home Depot, Glendale.I returned there shortly after but 
found no purse. Within an hour a woman returned the purse to my husband at his 
office with everything in it completely intact. She left no name or phone 
number and told my husband she was in a hurry.  
</P>
<P>
 So the only way I can convey my deep gratitude and thanks, to let her know how 
much I really appreciate her honesty, is in this newspaper, hoping that somehow 
she'll see this. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you again, mystery woman, whoever you are.

PIERCE COLLEGE FARM A DRAIN ON TAXPAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Of the 427 acres on which Pierce College sits, more than 300 are devoted to 
10 extremely diverse agricultural and horticultural programs described in the 
catalogue: everything from horse science to landscape planning and design. 
</P>
<P>
 The catalogue also describes 127 courses offered in the Agriculture 
Department, everything from Ag. 620, Basic Equitation (horseback riding), to 
Ag. 701, Retail Floral Design and Practices (how to be a florist).But of about 
16,000 students at Pierce, only about 200 are taking agriculture courses, and 
they account for less than 3% of the students. Ridiculous! 
</P>
<P>
 If the college administration had made a small working farm at Pierce 20 years 
ago, it would have served the entire area if nothing more than as a marvelous 
field trip for every elementary school in Los Angeles County. As it is, Pierce 
is stuck with a seven-or-so-member agriculture faculty who, counting salary and 
benefits, cost the taxpayers almost $500,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately they teach only subjects that few students care to learn. When 
one adds the cost of animal feed, care and upkeep, the so-called "farm" is 
costing the taxpayers more than $1 million each year for the partial education 
of a very few students. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous Pierce College presidents haven't had the chutzpah to face the 
obstreperous people such as the agriculture faculty or the local residents, all 
of whom care only about their own selfish interests -- the faculty their jobs 
and the residents their property values. I know the new president of Pierce 
College, Mary Lee, will have the courage to deal with the facts about the farm 
rather than the fantasies, and to do what is appropriate for the huge majority 
of Pierce College students and the California taxpayer.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; A CAMPAIGN THAT DOESN'T HOLD WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Another obscure South County water district is getting critical attention 
these days. This time it's the Tri-Cities Municipal Water District, which 
serves San Clemente, Capistrano Beach and a small part of northern San Diego 
County.  
</P>
<P>
 Out of sight, out of mind usually has been the operating method of water 
districts, but ironically, Tri-Cities is under scrutiny largely because of the 
high profile it is trying so hard to take. To get more visibility, it is 
spending a lot of money. Critics are asking some good questions about whether 
all that spending is necessary, and whether the campaign is basically an effort 
at self-perpetuation at a time when consolidation appears to be the wave of the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollars spent on getting the district's message out do seem awfully high. 
A proposal being discussed with the Marine Corps to share Camp Pendleton's 
underground water supply -- which, by the way, may yet prove to be a good idea 
-- is still in the environmental study stage. Yet last month alone, the 
district spent $31,000 on publicity. Then there is the $4,000 a month being 
paid to retain a Washington-based lobbyist and the $75 an hour being paid for a 
part-time administrative assistant.  
</P>
<P>
 Some are wondering aloud whether the functions of the district would be best 
taken over by, say, the city of San Clemente. Indeed, consolidation has been 
recommended by the Orange County Grand Jury, which recently focused on 
Tri-Cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending large amounts of money on consultants and publicity may call the 
wrong kind of attention to a district that basically buys water from one 
district and sells it to others. It's one thing to negotiate with the Marines; 
it's another to launch a $100,000 publicity campaign at a time when the grand 
jury and some of the district's own customers are wondering whether it is 
simply one more layer of unnecessary government bureaucracy.

 Softball / Pitcher 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a thigh injury, Pitt, one of Kennedy's best hitters, didn't bat 
last week.The injury apparently didn't hamper her in the pitching circle. 
Kennedy Coach Sue Hall said Pitt is more dominating than ever. She opened the 
week by pitching consecutive no-hitters, beating Rancho Alamitos, 1-0, Tuesday 
and Bolsa Grande, 3-0, Thursday. She then pitched a three-hit shutout in a 1-0 
victory over Garden Grove that kept the Fighting Irish alone in first place. 
Pitt improved her record to 11-1 and lowered her ERA to 0.30. Other notables: 
</P>
<P>
 * Angie Fancuberta, Fullerton, drove in the winning run in the final inning in 
victories over La Habra and Sunny Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wendi Griffin, Garden Grove, batted .600 with 11 runs batted in and seven 
runs scored in four games. 
</P>
<P>
 * Katie Mook, Foothill, finished second in the 300-meter low hurdles (45.26 
seconds) and fourth in the 100 hurdles (15.39) at the Mt. SAC Relays. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jennifer Slaney, Los Alamitos, had two hits, including a single that drove 
in the game's only run in a 1-0 victory over then-No. 1 Cypress.

 Mater Dei, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball / Pitcher 
</P>
<P>
 In the Monarchs' final game of the Upper Deck tournament this month, Harris 
pitched a one-hitter in a victory over Lafayette (Ky.).In his next start, last 
Friday, he pitched a no-hitter in an 11-0 victory over San Clemente. "When he 
has his breaking ball working, it makes his fastball seem faster and he can be 
pretty unhittable," Mater Dei Coach Bob Ickes said. Harris (5-0) struck out 
four Tritons and allowed only one runner, on a first-inning walk. The runner 
was thrown out trying to steal, so Harris faced the minimum. Other notables: 
</P>
<P>
 * Derya Buyukuncu, Woodbridge, won the 50 free in 20.82 seconds and the 100 
(45.44) as the Warriors won the Orange County Swim Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ryan Mariano, El Toro, had 30 kills in the No. 1 Chargers' five-game victory 
over No. 4 San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 * Franco Trani and Marco Materazzi, Los Alamitos, won all their doubles sets 
in the Griffins' 11-10 and 12 1/3-8 2/3 victories over Loara. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tiger Woods, Western, was seven-under-par in two Orange League victories, 
203-206 over Valencia and 181-234 over Savanna.

Fullerton.

this season. Orange Coast, which beat Riverside, 3-1, Monday, has a one-game 
lead over the Hornets.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS: GARRIDO PLEASED WITH HIS TITANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton baseball Coach Augie Garrido said he talked to his team 
quite a bit last week about keeping its run production "in a closer 
relationship" with its number of hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "That worked out fine when we got 20 runs on 20 hits on Saturday, but getting 
three runs on only three hits Sunday was stretching it a bit," Garrido said 
with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido, however, had plenty of reasons to be pleased after a three-game sweep 
over Nevada Las Vegas. The Titans won by scores of 16-1, 20-1 and 3-0 against a 
team that had come into the series with the Big West Conference's fourth-best 
hitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton is 31-8 and alone in first place in the Big West with 9-3 record 
after San Jose State beat Long Beach State in two of three weekend games. 
Fullerton and Long Beach State entered the weekend tied with 6-3 conference 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton moved up in both college baseball rankings with the sweep. The 
Titans are ranked second by Collegiate Baseball, behind Georgia Tech, and third 
by Baseball America, behind Florida State and Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido couldn't hope for much better pitching than he received in the UNLV 
series from Mike Parisi (8-2), Matt Wagner (9-0) and Dan Ricabal (4-0). Parisi 
gave up five hits Friday, Wagner three hits through seven innings Saturday and 
Ricabal five hits in a complete game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our pitchers really stayed focused," Garrido said. "This series confirmed the 
way we feel about our club. Our pitching is very effective." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive solid effort by Ricabal, who had pitched well 
through seven innings in the third game against Long Beach State a week earlier 
after struggling. "I feel very good about Ricabal right now," Garrido said. 
"It's hard to develop a third starter who is as solid as your first two and I 
think we're getting there with Dan and (Chad) Rolish." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido continued to be pleased with Dante Powell, the preseason All-American 
who has raised his average to .298 and leads the team in runs batted in with 
36. Powell drove in all three runs in Sunday's game with a bases-loaded triple. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's getting much more relaxed at the plate now and is having more fun," 
Garrido said. "He doesn't seem to be as bothered now by the high expectations 
and the outside pressures." 
</P>

 Cristi Clifford is only a sophomore at Fullerton, but she will be making her 
second appearance in the NCAA gymnastics championships this weekend in Salt 
Lake City. "My goal now is to qualify four years in a row since I was able to 
make it my freshman year," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford finished 28th in the all-around at the nationals last year. Her top 
scores included a 9.775 on the uneven bars and a 9.725 in floor exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford, who was seventh in the all-around in the NCAA West Regional, is one 
of two Titan gymnasts in the competition that begins Thursday and ends 
Saturday. Celeste Delia, fourth in the all-around in the regional, will finish 
her college career in the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford came dangerously close to a serious injury in the regionals in what 
has become her strongest event, the uneven bars. In warmups the day before the 
competition, Clifford hit her chin on the bar on her release move. The cut 
required seven stitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach (Lynn Rogers) had me go right back on the bars and do it again, once he 
saw it wasn't serious because he knew if I didn't do it right away again, I 
might be more concerned about it," Clifford said. "I was still a little nervous 
about doing the move in the event, but I was able to block it out. I had done 
it for what seemed like a million times before without any problem." 
</P>
<P>

 Two guards on the Fullerton women's basketball team, Shayla Bradshaw and Kim 
Cram, will be trying out in Tempe, Ariz., this weekend for the West team for 
this summer's U.S. Olympic Festival. The event is scheduled July 1-10 in St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Coach Debbie Ayres is hopeful that Bradshaw, in particular, will get 
serious consideration. "This will be Kim's first year of trying out, so it will 
be more of a learning experience for her, but I hope the selection committee 
will take a close look at Shayla this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw was the team's second-leading scorer as a sophomore this past season. 
She averaged 16.3 points, second to Autumn Hollyfield's 17.9 average. "Autumn 
isn't eligible to try out this time since she's beyond the 20-year-old limit 
they have for selections in basketball," Ayres said. 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton still hasn't announced any basketball commitments in the signing 
period that began Wednesday. . . . Titan distance runner Steve Frisone set a 
school record in the 5,000 meters with his time of 14:18.4 at the Mt. San 
Antonio Relays. . . . The Titan softball team won three of four games at Hawaii 
over the weekend, knocking Hawaii out of first place. Pitcher Jennifer 
Mortensen sparked the Titans with back-to-back victories. She pitched two 
one-hit shutouts, the second in relief. She is 13-14 for the season with a 1.94 
ERA. The Titans are 20-25 for the season, 9-9 in the Big West.

 Film: Rob Fried, who produced "Rudy," "So, I Married An Ax Murderer" and other 
films for TriStar Pictures, said Monday that he has entered a major deal with 
Savoy Pictures. His Fried Films will operate as an independent unit under the 
agreement, which calls for Savoy to guarantee production and distribution of an 
unspecified number of Fried-produced movies. Fried said he chose Savoy because 
of the creative freedom offered and because of his ties to Victor Kaufman, 
Savoy's chairman, and Lewis Korman, its president. The move is effective June 
15, when Fried's contract expires with TriStar, a Sony Pictures's unit. Fried 
also acknowledged that his decision to pick Savoy rather than stay with Sony 
was influenced by the recent departures of Jonathan Dolgen from Sony Pictures 
and Mike Medavoy from TriStar. Fried, a former executive with Columbia 
Pictures, 20th Century Fox and Orion, has worked closely with producer Cary 
Woods.

 Exhibition: After nearly five years of ownership, Sony is putting its name on 
the marquee. The Loews chain of movie theaters is expected to be renamed Sony 
Theaters, reflecting the company's status as a division of Culver City-based 
Sony Pictures Entertainment. The change was expected to be announced today by 
Loews co-Chairmen Barrie Lawson Loeks and Jim Loeks. The names on all the 
individual Loews theaters will eventually be changed, starting with those in 
the New York area. Sony acquired the Loews chain in 1989 when it bought 
Columbia Pictures Entertainment. Sony executives have said the chain enjoyed a 
record year in 1993, thanks largely to the overall box office Hollywood 
generated last summer. The company is the seventh-largest movie exhibitor, with 
nearly 1,000 screens in 15 states. Sony Theaters is undergoing expansion, with 
five theater complexes added in 1993 and at least six more due this year. JAMES

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: A PRIDE OF FILMS FROM NEW MGM LIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After suffering more trauma than the average teen-ager, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer 
finally gets to prove that the lion's curse has been lifted next month, when it 
starts to release the first batch of movies that have been largely supervised 
by the studio's new management. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the pack is "Clean Slate," a Dana Carvey comedy produced by Richard 
and Lili Zanuck. Then comes the real test as MGM rolls out two of the most 
high-profile movies of the summer -- "Getting Even with Dad," a comedy starring 
mega-child celebrity Macaulay Culkin and Ted Danson, and "Blown Away," a 
thriller with Oscar-winner Tommy Lee Jones and Jeff Bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood is closely watching all three projects for proof that there's more 
than high hopes behind the revival, which started in July when Frank Mancuso 
was named chairman and the company's disastrous finances were restructured. MGM 
already has flexed its muscle in the marketplace by becoming a serious buyer of 
material and by assembling a strong team of senior executives. But in some 
quarters there are lingering doubts about its staying power. 
</P>
<P>
 One concern is that Credit Lyonnais, which owns MGM, will bail out before the 
studio has fully recovered, and before the 1997 deadline for unloading it under 
U.S. banking laws. Credit Lyonnais helped add to those worries over the weekend 
when its new president, Jean Peyrelevade, told the Financial Times of London 
that the studio could be had now for $2.5 billion. Sources later said 
Peyrelevade was just trying to discourage bottom fishers by tossing out an 
obviously exorbitant figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood also worries that MGM is suffering a cash crunch, with many 
believing that the studio already has eaten through the $400 million that was 
supplied by Credit Lyonnais last July. The studio contributed to that 
perception, inadvertently it seems, when word got out earlier this year that it 
was trying to round up $300 million in additional financing. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview on Monday, however, Mancuso said that everything is on track 
as far as he's concerned. Mancuso said the bank remains fully committed to 
reviving MGM, despite the political problems it is suffering over a series of 
bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The policy is that maximum value can be obtained for the company when it is 
fully competitive in the marketplace," said Mancuso, who last week attended a 
quarterly Credit Lyonnais board of directors meeting in New York. "We have an 
exceptionally straightforward relationship with the bank. I've seen absolutely 
no change in that since I arrived." 
</P>
<P>
 Credit Lyonnais, for its part, said: "Nothing has changed in the bank's policy 
of rebuilding MGM to its full production and distribution capacity. The comment 
from (Peyrelevade) to the Financial Times only emphasizes that the bank will 
never sell MGM for peanuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Mancuso also shot down widely circulated rumors that the studio has run out of 
cash, and that Credit Lyonnais is financing it on a month-to-month basis. He 
said that there's still money left over from the original $400-million 
commitment and that MGM merely is seeking more financing as a way to bolster 
production and become less reliant on the bank's support. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood Reporter first revealed that MGM was trying to raise about $300 
million in working capital from a syndicate led by Chemical Bank two months 
ago. While there's been little progress since then, Mancuso said he hopes to 
have the financing secured by summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The $300 million would be added financing," Mancuso said. "Hopefully, some of 
our movies will do some business, so we'll have that too. . . . We believe we 
will be able to deliver exactly what we set out to do with financing put in 
place some time ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Credit Lyonnais inherited the studio in 1991, when Italian financier Giancarlo 
Parretti defaulted on about $1.3 billion in loans. The studio operated under 
severe financial constraints until last summer, when Creative Artists Agency 
Chairman Michael S. Ovitz, a consultant to the bank, helped persuade Credit 
Lyonnais to revive the operation as a prelude to selling it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most industry observers agree that Mancuso has gotten the studio off to a 
strong start by naming former talent agent Michael Marcus to head the MGM 
production wing and veteran Hollywood executive John Calley to run the newly 
revived United Artists wing. MGM also has bolstered its industry standing by 
signing distribution deals with Carolco Pictures and Polygram Filmed 
Entertainment, and by actively competing for strong material. 
</P>
<P>
 MGM plans to release eight movies this year and as many as 20 next year. 
Despite the scattered rumors surrounding the studio, most of the industry is 
rooting for it to succeed, since it represents a significant buyer of material 
and a cherished part of Hollywood history. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have not been wildly profligate spenders, but they certainly have been 
part of the mix," said entertainment attorney David Colden. 
</P>
<P>
 "They also have a fairly active production slate. Given that the newly 
constituted team has only been there a short period of time, it's an impressive 
operation."

LIFE COLLEGE FOUNDER BACKS CHIROPRACTIC FIELD; PROFILE: THE GEORGIA INSTITUTION 
PRESIDENT IS FIERCELY DEVOTED TO THE PRACTICE. BUT SOME FIND HIS PENCHANT FOR 
SELF-PROMOTION DAMAGING TO SPECIALTY'S CREDIBILITY. 
</P>

<P>
 A mere plaque or portrait on campus wouldn't be enough to identify Sid 
Williams as president and founder of Life College. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who runs the bustling chiropractic school with an evangelist's 
fervor and a salesman's bravura, thinks big -- for himself and his profession. 
</P>
<P>
 His face is chiseled into the large bronze eagle statue that stands as the 
college's symbol. Mementos of his life, from Boy Scout to football hero to 
college president, comprise a shrine to "Dr. Sid" in Life's reception area. 
</P>
<P>
 In his cluttered office is the tombstone of Harvey Lillard, believed to be the 
world's first chiropractic patient in the mid-1890s, as well as a bust of the 
man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to make a shrine to him," the 66-year-old Williams said. "I'm into 
that sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' intense devotion to promoting chiropractic has won him a legion of 
admirers. His suburban Atlanta college, founded 20 years ago with 22 students, 
now has 3,600 students and 600 faculty and staff members. He is a hero to the 
local chamber of commerce and regularly hobnobs with top politicians and 
entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams recently found a new way to promote Life when its basketball team, 
which includes several junior college transferees, reached the finals of a 
basketball tournament. The title game, which Life lost, was televised 
nationally on ESPN last month. 
</P>
<P>
 But his penchant for self-promotion, including television advertising, has 
infuriated some who say such antics damage chiropractic's credibility as a 
mainstream form of health care. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concept of P.T. Barnum -- I don't care what they say as long as they talk 
about me -- that went out with the circus," said Louis Sportelli, a 
chiropractor in Palmerton, Pa. "We need responsible, articulate and reasonable 
spokespersons for chiropractic. We're not dealing with a stupid public." 
</P>
<P>
 Sportelli is a spokesman for the American Chiropractic Assn., a rival of the 
smaller, Williams-led International Chiropractors Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The 23,000-member ACA says Williams' career has been marked by statements 
contradicting the scientific approach advocated by most chiropractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams rejects such criticism, particularly that which is aimed at his 
commercials, which appear on cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
 With his striking shock of silver hair, imposing brow and fixed smile, 
Williams is the star of the commercials, strolling the campus and expounding on 
Life's concept of "Lasting Purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the American way," Williams said. "If you take advertising out of the 
American system, you don't have the free enterprise system." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams became a believer in chiropractic after a chiropractor healed 
injuries he suffered while playing football for Georgia Tech, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduation, he and his wife, Nell, studied chiropractic at Palmer 
College in Davenport, Iowa. He sold cooking utensils to pay the bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams made good grades but had no passion for chiropractic until he had a 
flash of inspiration one day, he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had an experience with the idea of chiropractic and I understood it for the 
first time after I'd been there for two years," he said. "I was elated . . . 
this was a total, revolutionary new idea that was bigger than religion, law or 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was when I fell in love with chiropractic. I loved it as intimately as 
anything I ever did," he said. "Now I've got my wife, my family, my friends, 
chiropractic. Everything that I do is in that love capsule." 
</P>
<P>
 He has since relied on such moments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every benchmark that I do I don't think of it with my conscious mind," he 
said. "It is revealed to me from within." 
</P>
<P>
 Nell and Sid Williams returned to Atlanta in 1956 and started a practice that 
grew to 18 clinics in the Southeast. An initial attempt to start a chiropractic 
college failed, but Williams finally opened Life in 1974 and has since expanded 
the program to include other degrees such as business administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was involved in everything, from lecturing to the day-to-day running of 
it," said Robert C. Lombardo, an Atlanta chiropractor and 1982 Life graduate. 
"He's not a phony. He just states strongly what he believes in." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams wants to win university status for Life, launch a cable TV network 
and finish writing the five books he's working on simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 He has earned the right to toot his own horn, said Phil Sanders, president of 
the local chamber of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sid is a great visionary and a great leader," Sanders said. "He has a real 
success story and he's proud of it. I think that's great."

FORD TO PEDAL SOME OLD TIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ford Motor Co. and Syntene Co. have developed a process to recycle used car 
tires into brake pedal pads and other parts, the auto maker said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford said the pads, which will be used on vehicles next year, contain 50% 
recycled tire content.A single used tire can produce 250 pads. 
</P>
<P>
 The pads are being tested on a fleet of Ford Taurus police cars, Crown 
Victoria taxicabs and Lincoln Town Car shuttles in Alaska, Florida, Michigan, 
Nebraska and Nevada, Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto maker also said it is exploring additional uses for the recycled tire 
material, such as other pedal pads, carpet backing, splash guards and weather 
seals. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford said the process developed with Richmond, Ind.-based Syntene calls for 
the tires to be ground into a fine powder. After steel belting is magnetically 
removed, the rubber particles are mixed with plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford said it already is the largest automotive user of tire manufacturing 
scrap and purchases more than 18 million pounds a year for deflectors, shields 
and powertrain-related seals.

EXERCISE HELPS THOSE WHO HAVE LOST JOBS DEAL WITH UPSET; HEALTH: KEEPING FIT 
CAN AID IN COUNTERING THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ILLS THAT ARE CAUSED BY A 
LOSS OF EMPLOYMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Regular exercise, be it walking as little as 30 minutes a day, can help 
counter the physical and psychological dangers that can accompany the news that 
you've just lost your job. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians and therapists at a new outpatient program designed to help a 
"distressed population" -- the unemployed -- have learned that after losing a 
job there may be a marked deterioration of physical and psychological health. 
</P>
<P>
 Changes are especially evident in the heart and circulatory system, blood 
pressure and levels of depression. 
</P>
<P>
 "Changes in cardiovascular risk factors can be observed for at least two years 
following the loss of a job," warns Herman Oliver, a psychiatrist with the Long 
Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 His hospital has just set up a new outpatient therapy program designed to help 
unemployed people and their health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 For some individuals, he adds, "there is a marked impact on both the incidence 
and prevalence of severe depressive symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longer the period of unemployment, the more far-reaching the 
consequences," including alcoholism and marital strife, Oliver points out. 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Steven Gecha, an osteopathic surgeon with Sports Medicine of Princeton, 
N.J.: "Getting laid off can be quite a shock to the individual's system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although men, in particular, are taught to 'take it like a man' and not show 
emotion, when they get fired, they're angry and upset. And they can't put off 
working through their feelings," Gecha says. "They have got to confront them." 
</P>
<P>
 Losing a job can be particularly painful, as many middle-aged managers have 
learned, "if they've let themselves get out of shape," notes Samuel Osipow, a 
counseling psychologist at Ohio State University in Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people's former jobs inherently created an unhealthy situation" for 
them, he explains. "Their jobs may have involved exposure to excessive drinking 
after hours, and when they're fired, they could slip into even heavier 
drinking." 
</P>
<P>
 When the unemployed look in the mirror, says Osipow, they may discover "their 
clothes don't fit. They don't feel good about themselves, and when they're 
interviewing (for a new job), they don't project the impression they would 
like." 
</P>
<P>
 It's vital for them "to project a sense of well-being" just as they would need 
to project a sense of financial health if they were going to the bank for a 
loan, the psychologist contends. 
</P>
<P>
 Middle managers, he says, "are very vulnerable" and should be encouraged "to 
develop some kind of fitness program that involves participating with other 
people they can cross-network with and help their job search that way." 
</P>
<P>
 The unemployed will benefit physically and mentally if they can say, "I'm 
going to spend 30 minutes exercising every morning," Osipow says. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem with some fitness programs, such as joining a health club, he 
notes, "is that they require money, and people get worried about spending money 
when they're out of work." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is always walking, jogging and other inexpensive aerobic exercise. 
"Even if you don't have a lot of money, you can buy a used bicycle and ride." 
</P>
<P>
 After first checking with a physician, Osipow says, exercise newcomers can 
profit even from such simple things "as doing circles with your arms to loosen 
your joints, especially if you can do it with other people to get social 
support." 
</P>
<P>
 Gecha points out that runners can "get a sense of real euphoria from jogging," 
which can also combat pink-slip induced depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Jogging, he says, releases endorphins in the brain, a morphine-like substance 
responsible for producing a feel-good "runner's high." 
</P>
<P>
 Exercise will also help laid-off workers sleep better at night, when they 
might otherwise toss and turn dwelling on their misery, the sports medicine 
expert says. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who have slipped into poor health habits, Gecha continues, "dieting 
alone will not help them get into shape, but dieting and exercise will. They 
need to get into a regular exercise pattern and a regular sleep pattern."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: EXCELLENCE ROARS IN NBC 'LIONS'; TELEVISION: THE WORLD WAR II 
EPIC IS ENRICHED BY WRITER AND PRODUCER DAVID W. RINTELS' CREATIVE WORK AND BY 
THREE STELLAR PERFORMANCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Winston Churchill, prime minister of Great Britain during most of World War 
II, begins speaking with his back to the camera. As he slowly turns toward us, 
we see a man burdened by the crushing tonnage of leadership in wartime, fearing 
that an allied invasion of France across the English Channel will cost 300,000 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 His words are leaden with gloom: "I wake up at night . . . and see the channel 
floating . . . with the bodies of the cream of our youth." 
</P>
<P>
 If you're seeking affirmation that U.S. television still has an epic drama or 
two up its sleeve, and even an artistic pulse, tune in the NBC two-parter, 
"World War II: When Lions Roared," tonight and Wednesday night. Written and 
produced by David W. Rintels, it's stunningly successful both as vibrant 
entertainment and as a personalized, peephole-widening account of history from 
a serious and creative dramatist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Abetted by a troika of stellar performances -- John Lithgow as U.S. President 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Michael Caine as Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and Bob 
Hoskins as Churchill -- Rintels' scintillating, prodigiously researched 
teleplay relates the war from the often competing perspectives of the three 
commanders in chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the title, the only roaring here is figurative, and that's good. No 
one is easier to caricature than a high-profile figure with recognizable 
traits, from a grinning Roosevelt and his appendage-like cigarette holder to a 
stogie-chomping Churchill giving his "V" sign to a pipe-smoking Stalin hiding 
behind a mask of inscrutability as thick as tire rubber. 
</P>
<P>
 None of that here. And even though they are the visual center of the story, 
Lithgow, Hoskins and Caine (give credit to director Joseph Sargent too) never 
allow their performances to eclipse the war that is omnipresent despite being 
seen only in occasional newsreel footage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winston," Roosevelt assures Churchill, "trust me to the bitter end." But 
"When Lions Roared" is as much about high-level intrigues and special interests 
as anything, with even those closest of collaborators, Roosevelt and Churchill, 
alternating as human cracks in the alliance. Somehow, though, the three leaders 
put aside their mutual suspicions and separate political agendas long enough to 
act incisively and cohesively at critical moments. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Lions Roared" is unconventional television visually as well as 
artistically, using split screens, freeze frames and rear projections of 
newsreel footage in bold ways. There is a lot of clutter on the screen that 
initially takes getting used to, but Sargent masters these fascinating devices 
and they work in the long run, with the split screens narrowing time and 
physical gaps in ways that allow the three principals to have dialogues across 
the seas as if they were face to face. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side of the screen, for example, Churchill dictates a cable to his U.S. 
ally, while on the other side Roosevelt hears and responds to it as if he were 
in the same room. Add Stalin, and these simulated video conference calls become 
three-way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The actual face-to-face meetings of the Big Three -- at Tehran in 1943 and at 
Yalta in 1945 -- are the centerpieces of "When Lions Roared," just as these 
conferences were the strategic centerpieces of the war itself. Prior to Tehran, 
Churchill worries on the screen about the "stupendous issues" facing the 
Allies. And indeed, Tehran becomes a seedling for the Cold War while Yalta, in 
the Crimea, becomes the unofficial stamp of approval for a communist postwar 
Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Polish question" is a main course at Yalta, where a dying Roosevelt 
arrives in his wheelchair, appearing, as Churchill notes, shockingly "frail and 
ill, transparent almost." (Credit Linda De Vetta with making Lithgow look that 
way, and also with the convincing transformations of Hoskins and Caine.) As 
events would show, Stalin's idea of "free elections" for Poland differed from 
that of his U.S. and British counterparts.

 Rintels, however, has no intention of using these meetings (which were shot in 
Prague and spectacularly mounted by production designer James L. Schoppe) to 
create a definitive film record. His script's shorthand is hardly all 
inclusive, omitting the issue of Japan from the Yalta talks, for example.

 And there's no explanation for Churchill's shock at Tehran over Stalin 
cavalierly calling for the mass execution of German officers. What the script 
omits is that the Soviets were already suspected of murdering 1,700 Polish 
officers in the Katyn Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 More important to Rintels -- and a wise call, given the film's time 
limitations -- is the sense of history that comes from exploring the 
relationships at play here, and the differences in the personalities and 
approaches of the three leaders. Churchill and Roosevelt, for example, clash 
over military strategy and over Stalin, with the President much more trusting 
with regard to Soviet postwar intentions than is the British leader. "I don't 
know a good Russian from a bad Russian," Roosevelt says to his confidant, Harry 
Hopkins (Ed Begley Jr.), about Stalin.

 As "When Lions Roared" affirms, separating good television from bad television 
is much easier.

 MORE HISTORY: Everybody's a critic. All right, perhaps Christopher Columbus 
wasn't greeted on this continent by scantily clad dancing girls, as a network 
docudrama depicted in the 1980s. Maybe he didn't study his navigational charts 
by day, the body of Dona Felipa Perestrello by night. And it's likely he wasn't 
told by a fortuneteller: "I see much hardship, but your name will be famous."

 For better or for worse, though, television has indeed assumed a primary role 
as the nation's chronicler of the past, both near and distant. Thus it's only 
proper that an entire channel be devoted to history. One's on the way, in fact. 
Its announced mandate: to air historical documentaries, films and miniseries.

 As in Jaclyn Smith playing Florence Nightingale.

 Cable's 24-hour History Channel -- a sort of spinoff from the Arts & 
Entertainment Network -- is scheduled to debut by fall. Before junior 
historians get terribly excited, though, there's the History Channel's 
just-announced agreement with Columbia Pictures to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal to air 11 movies and miniseries from Columbia does not include the 
Italian-made Christopher Columbus biography mentioned above. It does include 
the Oscar-winning "Gandhi"; "Hope and Glory," John Boorman's very pleasing, 
kid's-eye view of World War II England; and various middle-brow film 
biographies. Plus, the History Channel promises that after each work, its host 
and guest historians will explore "any myths or dramatic license" in the 
presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Very nice. Yet on the negative side, the package contains a 1985 TV movie with 
Smith as Nightingale and a 1983 TV movie starring Cheryl Ladd as Grace Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 I see much hardship for the History Channel, but it's name will be famous. 
</P>
<P>
 * "World War II: When Lions Roared" airs at 8 tonight and at 9 p.m. Wednesday 
on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39).
