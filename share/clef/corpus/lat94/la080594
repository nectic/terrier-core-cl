MOVIE REVIEW; 'LITTLE RASCALS' UPDATES A LOST AGE OF INNOCENCE; THE FILM BLENDS 
SOPHISTICATION AND AFFECTION, BUT NEEDS MORE SLAPSTICK AND LESS ADULT REPARTEE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Between 1922 and 1944 producer Hal Roach turned out countless "Our Gang" 
comedies, featuring the antics of a beloved bunch of youngsters engaged in 
everyday exploits that were as endearing as they were hilarious. The series 
received new life with the advent of TV, where they were shown as "The Little 
Rascals" since MGM owned the rights to the title "Our Gang." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Little Rascals" has now become a stylistically venturesome but uneven new 
film by Penelope Spheeris, who brought "The Beverly Hillbillies" to the big 
screen with a successful blend of sophistication and affection. She brings 
those same qualities to this film, but it isn't as funny as it ought to be. 
Even so, it is unmistakably the work of a distinctive filmmaker whose work is 
always worthy of attention and rewarding in one aspect or another. 
</P>
<P>
 In the opening shot, which shows Alfalfa (Bug Hall) sitting on the front steps 
of a modest white clapboard cottage of the early '20s, you detect a TV antenna 
on the roof. Surely, an oversight, but no: This "Little Rascals" takes place in 
the present. What Spheeris has done is to dress her Gang in more or less 
vintage attire and film largely but not slavishly in older L.A. neighborhoods. 
This tactic really pays off, and is the film's key strength, which is to evoke 
the past in such a way as to suggest an innocence lost, for those locales have 
faded surely from the time when Roach might well have used them himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot line is rightly simple. The boys have formed their "He-Man Woman 
Haters Club" just as the sweet-natured Alfalfa has developed a crush on pretty 
little Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes). From Alfalfa's conflicting loyalties 
comes a string of skirmishes, misunderstandings and adventures culminating in a 
lively go-cart race. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with "The Little Rascals" is one of content rather than form. What 
the film needs is lots more classic slapstick, sight gags and pranks and lots 
less adult repartee. We need more chances to laugh out loud, as when Alfalfa 
and his best pal Spanky (Travis Tedford) are forced to disguise themselves as 
ballerinas and then proceed to wreak havoc on a little girls' "Nutcracker 
Suite" recital. Too much of the film is too reminiscent of the kiddie 
faux-gangster movie "Bugsy Malone," which had the strength of being entirely a 
period piece. Since Spheeris' film is set, more or less, in the real world, 
it's creepy when Alfalfa and Darla, 9 and 5, respectively, carry on like 
romantic teen-agers. But then even Shirley Temple's vintage impersonation of 
Mae West probably wouldn't play as innocently as it did 60 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 On the plus side are the film's many surprise cameos by adult celebrities 
(most of which are amusing), its great look, its terrific pacing and its punchy 
eclectic soundtrack. Many of the film's 13 key Rascals are as appealing as 
Hall, and as Buckwheat, Ross Elliott Bagley reveals an especially live-wire 
personality. "The Little Rascals" is such an emphatically well-shaped, 
well-crafted picture that you wish you could have enjoyed it more than you did. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG, for some crude dialogue. Times guidelines: Even though a 
couple of the youngsters are presented as romantically precocious , the film is 
definitely family entertainment.

MOVIE REVIEW; A DISTINCTIVE VOICE IN 'BARCELONA'; CLEVER DIALOGUE HIGHLIGHTS 
WHIT STILLMAN'S FEATURE ABOUT TWO AMERICAN COUSINS IN SPAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Barcelona" is only Whit Stillman's second feature, but he has already staked 
out a territory and a sensibility quite his own. Arch, eccentric romantic 
comedies that manage to be delicately off-balance without ever falling, 
Stillman's films are as unmistakable as his buttoned-down Brooks Brothers name. 
</P>
<P>
 Stillman's first film as a writer-director, "Metropolitan," was that rare 
$300,000 movie that was admired enough to be nominated for an Oscar (for best 
original screenplay). A knowing look into the improbable universe of New York's 
youthful socialites, it revealed how well Stillman knows his people and how 
cleverly he can reproduce their line of chat, gifts that "Barcelona" more than 
confirms. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, Stillman is back in WASP World, where "I don't care for your tone" 
is considered a killing retort and it's obvious, without even looking, that 
people are wearing wingtips or Weejuns. This time around his characters grew up 
in the Midwest, not Manhattan, and they're far from home in Barcelona, but the 
way they talk is still unmistakable. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is Stillman's ear for their kind of glib, slightly exaggerated 
conversation, for articulate upper-crust dialogue that is withering and ironic 
by turns, that marks him as that rarity among filmmakers, someone with a voice 
to call his own. 
</P>
<P>
 It is characteristic of Stillman's quirky sensibility that he claims that the 
original notion for "Barcelona" came to him when, after seeing the Richard 
Gere-Debra Winger film "An Officer and a Gentleman," he decided to make a film 
about two people, one an officer and the other a gentleman. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the gentleman, Ted Boynton (Taylor Nichols), who narrates "Barcelona" in 
an engagingly querulous voice-over. The local representative for a 
Chicago-based manufacturing company, Ted is a bit priggish, with a passionate 
Dale Carnegie-inspired belief in the culture of sales. Likely, if left alone, 
to spend his evenings simultaneously reading the Old Testament and shuffling 
around his apartment to the sounds of Glenn Miller's "Pennsylvania 6-5000," Ted 
has to be considered an unlikely protagonist. 
</P>
<P>
 Attached though he is to his quiet life, Ted finds it permanently disrupted 
when his cousin Fred, a Naval officer on special assignment from the Sixth 
Fleet and the kind of guest who, as Ted says, begins to stink on the first day, 
comes to town and moves in. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred, energetically played by Chris Eigeman, is one of those impossible people 
who are just amusing enough to prevent their friends from killing them. A 
self-absorbed freeloader who has never considered that he might be wrong or 
someone else might be right, Fred is the kind of arrogant individual who thinks 
changing the "No" to "Si" on anti-American graffiti is making an important 
socio-political statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The graffiti are around because "Barcelona" is carefully set "in the last 
decade of the cold war," when anti-Americanism was pervasive enough to lead to 
political violence. It was also a time when the sexual revolution, almost out 
of fashion in America, had become a way of life in Spain, causing one young 
woman to seriously say, "I don't want to go to bed with just anyone anymore. I 
have to be attracted to them sexually." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from driving Ted crazy by starting rumors that he wears painful leather 
straps on his underwear, Fred does have a positive effect on his cousin's 
social life. Though Ted has just about taken a vow to date nothing but "plain 
or rather homely girls" as a protest against the cult of attractiveness, he is 
soon going out with the glamorous Monserrat (Tushka Bergen) while Fred escorts 
the equally attractive Marta (Mira Sorvino). 
</P>
<P>
 Well-mannered and well-brought-up, Ted and Fred think they know what they're 
about, both in terms of the sensibilities of the city and the psyches of women. 
But it is one of the themes of "Barcelona" that in reality they are over their 
heads on all counts, more the "big, unsophisticated children" the Spaniards 
consider them to be than they'd ever like to admit. 
</P>
<P>
 As veterans of "Metropolitan," both Nichols and Eigeman handle Stillman's 
quirky dialogue exceptionally well, and Bergen and Sorvino are so adept it's a 
surprise to realize neither one is Spanish. As for the director, his personal 
connections to Barcelona, a city he lived in for years, gives the film a 
special integrity. Stillman simply sees the world differently than anyone else, 
and "Barcelona" underlines that that's what originality is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG-13 for drug content and a brief sex scene. Times guidelines: 
It includes a scene of violence, but overall it is a remarkably chaste film.

 'Clear' Winner: Large audiences are plunking down their money for Harrison 
Ford's new action movie, "Clear and Present Danger," which opened Wednesday on 
2,324 screens. Distributor Paramount Pictures on Thursday said the film made 
more than $4.6 million its first day in national release, making it the second 
largest Wednesday opening ever for a non-sequel film. The biggest remains 
Paramount's "The Firm," starring Tom Cruise, which last summer grossed $7.2 
million on its first day. Based on Wednesday's numbers, along with the wide 
appeal of Ford and author Tom Clancy, upon whose best-selling novel the film is 
based, the film is expected to dominate this weekend's moviegoing scene. 
</P>
<P>
 * Loverly Release: A fully restored version of "My Fair Lady," the George 
Cukor classic that won the 1964 best picture Oscar, will be released in 
selected Los Angeles and New York theaters Sept. 16. The film, which stars 
Audrey Hepburn as Eliza Doolittle, won eight Academy Awards, including best 
actor for Rex Harrison and best score for Andre Previn. The film was restored 
by Robert A. Harris and James C. Katz, who did similar work on "Spartacus" and 
"Lawrence of Arabia." Distributed by 20th Century Fox, the film will appear in 
limited release in at least 15 major cities sometime in September. It is due to 
be released on CBS-Fox Video in October; an accompanying documentary is 
planned. TELEVISION

 Emmy No. 1: ABC's "NYPD Blue" got word on Thursday that it had won the first 
of what may be several Emmy Awards when it was cited for outstanding 
achievement in casting. HBO's "And the Band Played On" will also receive a 
casting Emmy. Both awards will be presented in Pasadena on Sept. 10, the night 
before the televised Emmy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 * College on TV: PBS on Thursday launched "Ready to Earn," a national 
educational initiative aimed at "enhancing Americans' career opportunities and 
strengthening work force competitiveness." Announced jointly by PBS President 
Ervin Duggan and U.S. Deputy Secretary of Labor Thomas P. Glynn, the adult 
educational programming will piggyback on PBS' existing children's initiative, 
"Ready to Learn." The first "Ready to Earn" effort will be "Going the 
Distance," a telecourse allowing students to earn an associate of arts degree 
from local colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 * Local Reality: KCAL-TV Channel 9 on Monday debuts "Special Access," billed 
as "L.A.'s first-ever, locally produced reality show." Hosted by Dave Forman, a 
former news and programming director at KFWB radio, the 5:30-6 p.m. program 
focuses on subjects including "The Real Baywatch" (about California 
lifeguards), "Border Wars" (insights on border patrols in the United States and 
Mexico and the motivations of illegal immigrants) and a local SWAT team. LEGAL

MOVIE REVIEW; REBEL 'AIRHEADS' WITH A ROCKER CAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The L.A. rock 'n' roll scene is ripe for a great comedy. "Airheads," directed 
by Michael Lehmann and scripted by Rich Wilkes, is far from great. But it sure 
is ripe. It's bursting with bad ideas, half-good ideas, good and bad actors 
yelling and mugging. Like a lot of youth comedies, it's frenetic where it 
should be inspired. 
</P>
<P>
 The rock group the Lone Rangers can't get anybody to listen to their demo 
tape. When Chazz (Brendan Fraser), the group's leader, sneaks into and then 
gets booted out of the office of a big-shot record producer (Judd Nelson), he 
cooks up a desperate scheme to invade rebel radio station KPPX and get their 
demo aired. The Lone Rangers, turning realistic-looking water rifles on the 
staff, end up taking them hostage. Because the drama is being aired live, the 
group becomes folk heroes to the kids massed outside the station. Celebrity 
beckons -- so does prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The only reason to endure their antics is for the occasional funny cameo 
performance. Joe Mantegna plays the station's dyspeptic deejay, and he's 
hilarious. He has the haggard, aggravated look of someone who spends his life 
yowling at total strangers through a microphone. As the program manager, 
Michael McKean is good enough to remind you of his role as the British rocker 
in the great mock rockumentary "This Is Spinal Tap" (which he also co-wrote). 
Chris Farley, as a cop on the scene, keeps threatening to be funny, but the 
role doesn't often allow for his explosive talents. (He does have one memorable 
moment when he intimidates a male rocker by plucking his nipple ring.) 
</P>
<P>
 The three Rangers aren't particularly convincing as anything but actors trying 
to play rock 'n' rollers. Besides Fraser, who is stuck with the "sincere" role 
-- he doesn't want a record contract if it's only based on the group's 
notoriety -- there's Steve Buscemi's Rex, whose ranting wears thin fast, and 
Adam Sandler's Pip, who seems to be sharing a joke we're not in on. As the plot 
escalates and turns into a mishmashed comment on how the media turn criminals 
into celebrities, the whole thing begins to look like "Dog Day Afternoon" for 
-- well -- airheads. 
</P>
<P>
 Now if only the Lone Rangers had been played by Beavis and Butt-head. 
</P>
<P>

FAMILY; VIDEOS TO GET THE KIDS OFF COUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Are you the parent of a pint-sized couch-potato-in-training? Or a "Calvin and 
Hobbes"-type live wire who never sits still? Whatever your offspring's style, 
here are four highly engaging home videos that can get kids moving in the right 
direction. Moms and Dads too. 
</P>
<P>
 Topping the list are "Monkey Moves" and "Move Like the Animals," two playful 
videos for ages 3 to 8 that are standouts in imagination, simplicity and 
child-development awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 In each, a group of four young children meet up with various animal friends 
(adults in costume) who show them such fun moves as how to stretch like a cat, 
jump like a frog, roll like a baboon, walk like a monkey and crawl like a 
caterpillar. Created by movement specialist Dr. Stephen Rosenholtz, the videos 
are unglitzy and easy on the ears and the on-camera cast is likable, without 
any overeager show-biz aggressiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 The easy-to-follow exercises, done to original jazz tunes, are nearly 
irresistible, even for grown-ups, and all the while what seems like play is 
teaching children the basics of balance, coordination and physical stability. 
</P>
<P>
 The charming title and set watercolor illustrations and deceptively simple 
handcrafted masks by designer Yoshiko Fujita are a subtle plus. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Monkey Moves" and "Move Like the Animals," Rosewood Publications, $19.95 
each. (800) 223-7899. Running time: 25 minutes. * 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone Can Dance Preschoolers" (ages 2 to 6) and "Everyone Can Dance" (ages 
6 to 12) are more formal and may be less immediately understood, in that they 
teach specific dance steps, but there's a large fun factor here too.  
</P>
<P>
 As professional dancer-instructor Linda Strickland swiftly guides a troupe of 
children through a musical workout that includes jazz and hip-hop, upbeat 
children's songs about trains, ducks, frogs, colors and letters inspire short 
dance routines. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the energetic routines are easier to follow for the first time than 
others, but not difficult to do after a few tries -- and Strickland's 
encouraging words let viewers know they don't have to worry about getting it 
right away. You might want to pause the tape to extend the brief stretching 
warm-up, though, or even modify it -- Strickland uses a bouncing stretch 
technique that many exercise experts avoid.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; TOAD BEEFS UP SOUND FOR A SUNNY SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Toad the Wet Sprocket is a band of simple and somewhat fragile charms, and on 
record its gentle, wistful pop songs can drift by without much impact. In the 
Fairfax High School auditorium on Wednesday, however, the Santa Barbara-based 
band muscled up its sound with harder guitars and vibrant, lively vocals.Even 
for skeptics, it was hard not to be coaxed into the sunny mood of the 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 A band that takes its name from a Monty Python skit, plays an impromptu 
version of ABBA's "Dancing Queen," celebrates humiliation in a song called 
"Stupid" and observes in another that a departing lover bends her words "like 
Uri Geller's spoons" obviously has a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 But the four musicians mostly worked their way through the well-paced, 
90-minute set in a steady and earnest fashion. This seriousness of purpose was 
tempered by singer-guitarist Glen Phillips' pleasantly nonchalant stage 
presence. Between songs, he discussed the overflowing backstage toilets, 
gargled and conducted a brief Q&A session with the crowd.  
</P>
<P>
 Toad's dramatic melodies and steady tempos don't leave much room for 
stretching out musically, but the band energized each of its tunes with deft, 
dynamic playing and a kind of barefoot, blue-eyed soulfulness. New songs such 
as "Something's Always Wrong" and "Fall Down" came off particularly well. CHUCK

JAZZ NOTES: STRONG LINEUP ON TAP FOR ANNUAL PASADENA FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Nnenna Freelon, thinking creatively seems to come as naturally as 
breathing. The36-year-old singer is an insightful artist whose renditions of 
both classic standards and recent originals sound personal and fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 To sing a tune freely and with spontaneity, Freelon says, she visualizes songs 
as houses. "I'm always searching for the door, so I don't have to stand 
outside, little me, and sing up at it," says Freelon, speaking from her home in 
Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I find the door, then I can stand in the center and sing from the inside 
out," says Freelon, who performs this weekend at the Pasadena Jazz Festival/94 
at Ambassador Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival, which is in its fourth season, is offering one of the strongest 
mainstream jazz lineups of any major Southern California event in years. 
Saturday night's concert bill, which begins about 8:45, is headlined by 
organist Jimmy Smith. Freelon shows up Sunday afternoon at 1:30 along with Earl 
Klugh. Piano ace Benny Green arrives at 6 that evening and the festival 
concludes with saxophonist Joe Henderson's trio at 8:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, easily the most well-known performer on the Hammond B-3 organ, is 
renowned for his gritty blues inflections, and his quartet will include two of 
his longtime associates: saxophonist Herman Riley, who possesses a breathy, 
pliant tone, and deft guitarist Terry Evans. The Saturday concert will be 
opened by another Southern California favorite adept at the exclamations and 
joys found in the blues: Jimmy and Jeannie Cheatham's Sweet Baby Blues Band 
from San Diego (though several of the key players are from Los Angeles). Hank 
Crawford, the redoubtable blues altoist, will guest with the Cheathams. 
</P>
<P>
 Freelon, who has only been on the international jazz scene for two years, has 
just released her third Columbia Records album, "Listen." She is a gifted 
singer with a lush, rich voice and is equally at home with standards, jazz 
classics -- she penned the lyrics to Wayne Shorter's "Footprints" and McCoy 
Tyner's "Ballad for Aisha" -- and originals: "Listen" contains six tunes 
written or co-written by Freelon. She opens for Klugh, who for almost 20 years 
has been a contemporary jazz star, offering melodic and highly rhythmic, if 
somewhat nondescript, numbers that have long pleased audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Pianist Green, already a master at mixing technical bravado with heartfelt 
essence, continues to be one of the most celebrated young players in jazz, and 
he brings along his nonpareil bassist, Christian McBride. Green and McBride 
will be joined by George Fludas, the pianist's latest find on the drums. 
</P>
<P>
 While festival closer Henderson has always sounded marvelous, he's certainly 
at the peak of his career in terms of visibility, winning polls in a variety of 
jazz magazines and seeing his Verve-label albums selling more than 100,000 
copies worldwide. He fronts a piano-less trio with bass giant George Mraz, who 
rarely travels to our area, and drummer Al Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Ambassador Auditorium shows, the festival also offers free 
concerts offered on Ambassador's Mall on Sunday with solid saxophonist Rickey 
Woodard at 4:30 p.m. and guitarist Frank Vignola at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets are priced from $26.50 to $29.50 for individual concerts and $62 to 
$69 for a three-concert series. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambassador Auditorium is located at 300 W. Green St. in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Information: (818) 304-6161. 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz Goes to College: Common Grounds, the small coffeehouse located near Cal 
State Northridge, is expanding its jazz policy, and is hosting six jazz acts 
this week. Tonight it's saxman Rob Kyle, Saturday bassist Hersh Hamel offers a 
tribute to Chet Baker. On Sunday, Chuck Johnson's Jazztet goes with mainstream 
sounds, while on Monday, expect sax whiz Doug Webb to blow out the walls with 
energized post-be-bop fomentations. On Tuesday, invigorating guitarist Jim 
Hershman holds forth, then on Thursday, refreshing vocalist Cathy Segal-Garcia 
is on tap. 
</P>
<P>
 Shows are at 8 p.m. No cover, $2.50 minimum.

JAZZ REVIEW; MIXED RESULTS AT BRAZILIAN NIGHT AT BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was just past 10 p.m. before headliner Sergio Mendes and Brasil '99 finally 
reached the Hollywood Bowl stage Wednesday night for a program of Brazilian 
music, their arrival stalled by seemingly interminable production delays. 
Inevitably, audience departures began before the end of Mendes' truncated set. 
</P>
<P>
 Were the 1960s pop-bossa hit-maker and his current ensemble worth the wait? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes and no. Yes, when he brought his four-member percussion team forward for 
an entertaining display of the timbres and rhythms of Brazilian music included 
on his new recording, "Brasileiro." And, yes, on the very infrequent instances 
when he performed early hits such as "Mas Que Nada." 
</P>
<P>
 But when Mendes added singer Joe Pizzulo for a couple of eminently forgettable 
numbers, the Brazilian magic disintegrated, replaced by the too-transparent 
commercial goals of pop balladry. 
</P>
<P>
 Milton Nascimento, in his second Southland appearance of the summer, sounded 
surprisingly complacent. Only occasionally did he generate the mixture of 
activism, sensuality and sheer panache that is so intrinsic to his music. There 
were a few other attractive moments: a contrapuntally harmonized group vocal, 
some gorgeous blendings of accordion and synthesizer, and Nascimento's 
characteristically bittersweet sound. As with Mendes, however, this was not 
always Nascimento at his very best. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Leny Andrade, a last-minute substitution for Gal Costa, was also 
uneven. Her too-slow reading of "Dindi" revealed glaring weaknesses in her 
effort to revive the Sarah Vaughan style. But her up-tempo scatting -- 
especially on "Night in Tunisia" -- clearly justified her growing reputation as 
one of the finest vocal jazz improvisers in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist Oscar Castro-Neves, who accompanied Andrade, had the unenviable job 
of opening the show. Ironically, his music was at times more appealing than 
that of the better-known artists. Filled with bright melodies, high-flying jazz 
lines and impeccable guitar work, Castro-Neves' tunes brilliantly merged the 
spirit of jazz improvisation with the soul of Brazilian rhythm. DON HECKMAN

A FULL-BODIED AND VIBRANT METAPHOR FOR 'MARLENE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In today's bare-all society, in which, generally speaking, there are slasher 
movies, crasser singers and books that are less than zero, the qualities of 
charm and restrained elegance have fallen into sad disuse. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Rendez-vous With Marlene" at the Melrose, celebrated Norwegian chanteuse 
Torill goes a long way toward correcting the imbalance. Torill's one-woman show 
about the life of Marlene Dietrich is not an impersonation, nor is it an 
homage. It is a fully fleshed, vibrant portrayal that captures the essence of a 
great star, with all her wit, grit, haughtiness and naughtiness presented 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh out of heaven, where she has already made quite a conquest of St. Peter, 
Marlene launches into song, dishes the dirt, relates some of the gamier 
anecdotes from her past -- and shares a few personal heartaches as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first act, Torill makes a spectacular entrance in a fabulous knock-off 
of Marlene's famous signature garment. The flesh-colored bodice cascades into 
artfully filigreed breasts, giving the illusion of gilded nudity. For Marlene, 
illusion was all. The gown could well be a metaphor for Marlene herself, 
apparently bared to the public but actually carefully covered at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 With her second-act entrance in tie, tails and top hat, Marlene makes it clear 
that her tastes have changed -- from champagne to Scotch, from cigarettes to 
cigars, from men to women. Half-mocking, half-sensual, Marlene flirts wickedly 
with both sexes in the audience. After all, she's dead now and doesn't have to 
worry about appearances.  
</P>
<P>
 Torill's humorously deadpan accompanist and musical director Stan Freeman, who 
was Dietrich's musical director for 12 years, is the perfect foil for Marlene's 
temperamental outbursts. Director Jules Aaron paces the proceedings perfectly, 
while Bradley Kaye's sumptuous set and Lawrence Oberman's superb lighting would 
satisfy the most demanding diva. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Rendez-vous With Marlene," Melrose Theatre, 733 N. Seward, Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends Aug . 31. $20. (213) 
466-1767. Running time: 2 hours, 15 minutes. Enjoying the Humor of 'Summerfolk' 
</P>
<P>
 Although a cut above the flophouse denizens of "The Lower Depths," the 
characters in Maxim Gorky's "Summerfolk," at the Ivy Substation, are fashioned 
from the same bolt of cloth. Far more educated and affluent than their 
proletarian predecessors, these are still "the people," the children of chefs, 
laborers and washerwomen. However, in the soft glow of a summer twilight, you 
just might mistake them for the aristocracy. 
</P>
<P>
 When first produced in 1904, Gorky's transparently pro-Bolshevist work created 
a furious controversy. Nowadays, the play can be appreciated as a period comedy 
of manners, flowing over with humor, passion and Russian volatility. 
</P>
<P>
 The play's characters can be separated roughly into two categories: the 
complacent, who mindlessly pursue pleasure; and the self-righteous, who 
endlessly discuss their disenchantment and ennui. At play's end, exhausted from 
spinning in a welter of "dead words," the self-righteous sect takes decisive 
action, breaking away from the complacent core group and rushing off to create 
a new life -- and, one presumes, a revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Direction is key to this lengthy masterpiece, and E. Teresa Choate manages to 
keep the pacing crisp within the generally languid rhythms of the play. The 
acting ensemble is consistently very impressive indeed. Michelle Robinson's 
painstaking period costumes and Kenton Jones' attractive set round off this 
talented young company's production of a neglected classic. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Summerfolk," Ivy Substation, 9070 Venice Blvd., Culver City. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends Sept . 3. $17. (310) 558-1555. Running time: 2 
hours, 55 minutes. Boyish Comedy Gets 'Grounded' by Plot 
</P>
<P>
 "Grounded for Life" at the Tamarind is the theatrical equivalent of "The 
Flintstones" -- and, adults in the audience notwithstanding, seemingly geared 
to just about the same age group. For the first half hour, you giggle at the 
show's silly props and sheer zaniness. Then, your eyes glaze over, your jaw 
goes slack and you begin sneaking surreptitious glances at your wristwatch. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Holdman (Pat Hazell) was grounded for life 18 years ago for throwing a 
snowball at a school bus. Now 29 years old, Pat has not been out of his room 
since -- but Kaspar Hauser he's not. In fact, he's managed to keep abreast of 
things very well, thank you, largely because of a secret tunnel hidden under 
his toy chest that his friends use to sneak in and out of his room. Pat even 
has a girlfriend, although she's getting a little tired of waiting for Pat to 
re-enter the outside world.  
</P>
<P>
 Comedian Hazell, who co-wrote the show with Bill Habeeb, is a breezy, boyish 
entertainer whose comic invention gets crushed by the rusty machinery of his 
dreadfully contrived plot. Director Shawn Nelson keeps the action cranking 
along as best he can. Keven Lock's frozen-in-time set, complete with ant farms 
and Farrah Fawcett posters, is ultimately more entertaining than the show 
itself. Gregg Binkley, as Pat's nerdy pal Ernie, consistently outshines his 
material. 
</P>
<P>
 More suited for a comedy sketch than a two-act play, "Grounded for Life" 
should be sent to its room. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Grounded for Life," Tamarind Theatre, 5919 Franklin Ave., Hollywood. 
Mondays-Wednesdays, 8 p.m. Ends Aug . 17. $12. (213) 466-1767. Running time: 1 
hour, 40 minutes. 'Lesbian Sea Gulls' Fails to Take Flight 
</P>
<P>
 Another example of stretching an interesting premise to the breaking point is 
"Lesbian Sea Gulls," a collection of one-acts at the Celebration Theatre 
inspired by purportedly "lesbian" mating practices among sea gulls on the 
Channel Islands. Local playwrights were approached by the Celebration's 
artistic director, Robert Schrock, to give their own take on this natural 
phenomenon. These six one-acts are the result. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, given a more elliptical approach, these plays could have proven a 
provocative examination of biological sexual imperatives. Unfortunately, some 
of the writers selected have taken their quirky assignment far too literally.  
</P>
<P>
 The evening's comedies are cases in point. Frequently repetitive, these 
attempted farces feature cawing, flapping actors in campy bird attire, a 
dubious comic device that is rendered egregious by Catherine Coke's stilted 
staging. The cast mugs, cavorts, caws shriekingly and assumes bizarre dialects 
at the drop of a feather. Among the performers, Lily Mariye and Susan Mosher 
manage some intermittently fine work. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship dramas, blessedly devoid of antic avians, fare somewhat 
better. However, only Pamela Gray's "Supernormal Clutches," the evening's comic 
closer, is a genuinely amusing and sustained effort that transcends its gooney 
bird analogies. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's face it: You can get just so much drama out of gay gulls. By 
relentlessly bludgeoning home its premise, this production makes the 
association between sea gulls and garbage unavoidable. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Lesbian Sea Gulls," 7051 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood. Thursdays-Sundays, 
8 p.m. Ends Sept . 3. $15-$20. (213) 660-8587. Running time: 2 hours, 15 
minutes.

RESTAURANT NOTES: 'EDUCATED' FARE WITH A DADA TWIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I want to educate, not imitate," says chef Sam Marvin. "Salmon and swordfish 
are on every menu in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 So when he opens late next month in the former Andreas space on Melrose, 
Marvin plans to teach his customers that there are other fish in the sea -- 
25,000 varieties to be exact. There won't be any pasta or pizza or contemporary 
bistro fare on what he calls his "creative California" menu, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I have good taste in food and I'm sure a lot of people will enjoy 
eating what I like to eat," says Marvin, who was sous chef at Patina on Melrose 
before moving on to the Monkey Bar, where he cooked until eight months ago. 
"Just because people want simple food these days, doesn't mean they have to 
settle for the same old thing. Why not eat sardines and ika and angel fish?"  
</P>
<P>
 Marvin also plans to serve Champagnes by the glass, and the wine list will 
feature unusual finds from around the globe. "I am not going to put a Fetzer or 
a Mondavi or a Cakebread on my list," he says. "You can find those anywhere." 
Investors in the 75-seat space include several sports figures, including former 
NFL linebacker Jerry Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin is considering naming his place Modada, after dadaism, the absurdist, 
anti-establishment art movement founded in 1916. "Everyone who opens a 
restaurant these days is using their own names -- Russell's and Jackson's and 
Mortons," he says. "It's a lack of creativity." 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the dada spirit, the chef has hired young artists to design 
plates and glassware, and he's got a fledgling fashion designer creating an 
entire uniform collection. No black pants, white shirts and ties for his staff. 
"No uniform will be the same," Marvin says, "but they'll all tie into the 
collection." 
</P>
<P>
 More Sporting News: NBA basketball stars and former UCLA roommates Don MacLean 
(Washington Bullets) and Trevor Wilson (Sacramento Kings) have opened Sandbag's 
in Westwood. At the gourmet sandwich shop, the turkeys and roasts are baked 
daily and all sandwiches are served in brown paper bags.  
</P>
<P>
 Going Coconuts: Sources say Twin Palms in Pasadena has become so wildly 
successful that partners Michael Roberts and Kevin Costner are already making 
plans to clone their concept in Orange County. "People have approached us about 
developing spaces," confirms chef Roberts, "but it's really all in the very, 
very preliminary stages." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Roberts, other future Twin Palms sites being discussed include 
Las Vegas, Arizona, even Marseilles. "There are a number of places that I think 
are ready for this concept," says Roberts, "and most of them are dry and hot." 
</P>
<P>
 Happy Anniversaries: La Salsa in Beverly Hills celebrates its 10th anniversary 
Saturday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. with a live mariachi band, salsa music, dancers 
and 99 cent margaritas. . . . Gilliland's Cafe celebrates its 10th birthday 
this month, too. Customers who dine at the Santa Monica restaurant in August 
will receive a package of owner Gerri Gilliland's new Irish soda bread mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Noted: The restaurant community was saddened to hear of the recent death of 
Gilbert Le Coze, chef-owner of the highly respected Manhattan seafood 
restaurant Le Bernardin. The French-born Le Coze, 49, died of a heart attack 
while working out at his health club.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: ABIQUIU: TASTEFULLY PARED-DOWN BIKINI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. IRENE VIRBILA, TIMES RESTAURANT CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a while, it looked as if Bikini, John Sedlar's brilliantly eccentric Santa 
Monica restaurant, would become yet another casualty of the double-whammy 
earthquake-recession. For the past six months, the stylish two-story space has 
been closed. And in May, Sedlar opened another restaurant in downtown San 
Francisco, thereby fueling the perception (mistaken) that L.A.'s best chefs are 
defecting to the City by the Bay. Not so; he's only consulting at Abiquiu up 
north. 
</P>
<P>
 But the concept for the more casual, lower-priced Southwestern place worked so 
well there that on July 28, Sedlar finally re-opened his Santa Monica 
restaurant, not as Bikini, but as Abiquiu, subtitled "a New Beginning in Modern 
Southwest Cuisine." The name comes from the New Mexico pueblo where Sedlar's 
grandparents had a ranch; the phone number is the same as the former Bikini's. 
</P>
<P>
 The food at Abiquiu is less precious, less elaborately plated than Bikini's 
high-priced fare, but it's still recognizably Sedlaresque. Now when you order 
his signature "rattlesnake" of caviar, instead of sevruga and beluga, it's 
composed of domestic whitefish and sturgeon caviar (and it's $15 instead of $30 
or $50). A traditional chicken tamale is napped in a blood-red chile sauce -- 
and served on the infamous Madonna plate. There's a satisfying bowl of red corn 
posole stained with crimson chile and a Taos Caesar salad with blue corn bread 
croutons. Whitefish is encrusted with whole pumpkin seeds and paired with 
jungle green jalapeno mashed potatoes. The Pecos River campfire trout with 
smoky bacon, fried quail's egg and hashed browns makes a fine supper. So does 
the enchilada rolled with pale rabbit loin. 
</P>
<P>
 It's basic Sedlar at affordable prices and easily the most appealing menu I've 
seen in recent months. And though the name has changed, he hasn't done a thing 
to the room, which remains one of the most beautiful in L.A. Even at this early 
stage, Abiquiu shows great promise. 
</P>
<P>
 * Abiquiu, 1413 5th Street, Santa Monica. (310) 395 - 8611. Open for dinner 
Monday through Saturday; lunch starts mid-August. All major credit cards. Valet 
parking. Appetizers $5-$15; entrees $12-$18.

ART REVIEW; 'FRAGILE ECOLOGIES': WORKING TO KEEP THE GREEN GREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Humankind has made a mess of the planet. It's so bad some artists feel they 
can't go on doing business as usual. Working as individuals or in teams they 
blend aesthetic insight with the sensitivity of landscape architects and the 
conservationists' conviction that the real world must be acted upon. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of this dedication to Mother Earth can be seen in "Fragile Ecologies: 
Contemporary Artists' Interpretations and Solutions" at the Laguna Museum of 
Art. Organized by the Queens Museum of Art, it's on national tour under the 
auspices of the Smithsonian Institution. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of the show may give some art lovers a headache. These days they go 
to galleries to get in touch with the higher muse and find themselves faced 
with callow preachments on the evils of society. They can rest assured that 
this exhibition doesn't work like that. Somehow the idealism that drives it 
makes it feel as sweetly pastoral as a Claude Lorrain landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that it's sentimental. One of the nicest bits in it is a meandering row of 
television sets. Resting on the floor, their screens face upward filled with 
the waters of a babbling river. The sound is soothing, the reflections 
enchanting even if the whole thing is made of videotape. Where can this lovely 
place be?  
</P>
<P>
 Believe it or not, it's the Los Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989 video artist Cheri Gaulke teamed up with Susan Barron who heads a 
special program for seniors at Wilson High School. Working with students they 
launched "L.A. River Project." The kids found patches of thriving life along 
the course of the famously dry bed. They came up with visionary but workable 
plans to turn this sinkhole into an Edenic park. They learned that sometimes a 
drawing is a thing of beauty in itself, sometimes a plan to improve reality. 
</P>
<P>
 The team of Helen Mayer Harrison and Newton Harrison is certainly the best 
known of Eco-Art practitioners. As far back as the '70s, they combined the 
growing fashion for conceptual art with earthworks projects like those of 
Robert Smithson, Michael Heizer and, of course, Christo. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971 their ideas were so new, they got the artists in trouble. As part of 
an exhibition at London's Hayward Gallery they intended to celebrate nature by 
cooking up some real catfish that were part of their piece. The tabloid press 
exploited the idea. English animal lovers panicked. A scandal ensued. It was 
finally sorted out but the incident was traumatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Their present piece is mellower. Titled "Breathing Space for the Sava River," 
it follows the course of a Yugoslavian stream using maps, text and particularly 
lovely color photographs. The combination makes the waterway seem like a living 
thing. It's a world in itself, supporting aquatic life. It's also on a journey, 
dispensing goodness along the route, nourishment for land and people, power for 
dams and beauty for all. It's also a great place for people to dump stuff. 
That's how we repay its kindness. 
</P>
<P>
 Artist Buster Simpson is as worried as everybody else but he tries to lighten 
up a bit. In one project he tried to help the Hudson River by giving it giant 
Tums. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that when we are not polluting nature, we are smothering it. Who 
needs a park when you can build a nice parking lot? 
</P>
<P>
 Artist Alan Sonfist tried to convince New Yorkers that all the trees in town 
shouldn't be imprisoned in Central Park. He planted a nice little urban forest 
of native trees in Greenwich Village. Mierle Laderman Ukeles took another tack. 
She accepted the unlikely post of artist-in-residence at the New York City 
Department of Sanitation to push her ideas on recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, all of this sounds rather familiar. Assemblage artists have been 
reclaiming the effluvium of American consumerism for decades. There is a 
wonderful, dippy, quixotic, utopianism about this work and the way it flies so 
cheerfully and earnestly in the face of the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Johanson managed to save a sick lagoon in Dallas. Nancy Holt thinks 
urban life, packaged food and artificial light have made us forget the crucial 
role of the sun. To remedy this, she's building Dark Star Park in Virginia. Its 
centerpiece will be a pyramid-style mound on a 57-acre site made of 10 million 
tons of garbage. Artist Mel Chin uses plants to clean up toxic wastes. Up in 
Central California, Heather McGill and John Roloff are hard at work on a shrine 
and habitat for indigenous hummingbirds. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these notions are poetically appealing on paper. Artists being 
notoriously reclusive and anti-authoritarian by stereotype could not be blamed 
for leaving them as conceptual fantasies. But all try to make them real. They 
talk to experts. They joust with bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who's ever tried to get a simple building permit knows that takes a lot 
of courage.

THEATER REVIEW; A MEDIEVAL 'DISPUTATION' OF TIMELY ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Based on a historical incident, "The Disputation," at the Tiffany Theatre, 
deals with the Barcelona debate in 1263 between Rabbi Moses Ben Nachman and 
Catholic priest Pablo Christiani, a Jewish convert to Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized by the Catholic Church, the debate is intended to instruct the Jews 
in the error of their ways and spark mass conversions. King James of Aragon, 
currently in disfavor with the Pope, hopes to appease the church by sanctioning 
the disputation. However, being a sporting man, he's also hoping for a good 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Christians, the disputation is a chess game, a power play, an 
intellectual exercise. For the Jews, it's a matter of life and death. Similar 
disputations, like a recent one in France, have already resulted in Jewish 
blood baths. If the Jews lose and fail to convert, they will be hounded, 
harassed, possibly exterminated. If they win, an outraged Christian populace 
will sweep down upon them, with the same devastating result.  
</P>
<P>
 Not so in this case, insists James, who ensures the Jews free speech, a fair 
contest and protection against reprisals. Even with these unprecedented 
assurances, Rabbi Ben Nachman, who has been chosen to represent the Jews, would 
just as soon forgo the honor. He fears the outcome, rightly so. Resolving to go 
down fighting, Nachman triumphs over his Christian antagonists, a Pyrrhic 
victory, but a sweet one nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyam Maccoby's play arose from his 1982 book "Judaism on Trial," an account of 
the medieval disputations between Christian and Jewish scholars that contained 
the first definitive translation of the Barcelona debate. A noted scholar 
himself, Maccoby has written a terse, assured drama that only occasionally 
falls into the dusty cadences of the university lecture hall.  
</P>
<P>
 Asaad Kelada directs with intellectual assurance, yet his staging is oddly 
static. Kelada favors rigidly composed groupings somewhat reminiscent of 
tableaux vivants , freezing his performers in pretty pictures that make us all 
too aware of the directorial process at work. Russell Pyle's stark yet handsome 
set and moody lighting provide an effective backdrop for Kelada's snapshots. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the formidable cast of seasoned stage veterans, Jacob Witkin is 
particularly fine as James, a lusty ruler who is more pagan than pious. Also 
exceptional is Neil Hunt as the quietly inexorable Dominican leader whose 
outward benevolence masks a chilling determination. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Kates, who plays the vital central role of Nachman, is competent, but 
lacks the fire and authority that would spark the play as a whole. Perhaps 
opening-night jitters will smooth out into a more fortunate performance down 
the line. Robert Desiderio plays Catholic priest Pablo Christiani. 
</P>
<P>
 This play is not perfect, but it is important. Between the interstices of 
Maccoby's medieval drama, one can hear dismayingly modern murmurings of 
genocide and ethnic cleansing. Maccoby amplifies the whispers into a shouted 
warning. 
</P>

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; REASSEMBLED 'ZIEGFELD FOLLIES' ARRIVES ON LASER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The MGM/UA laser-disc release of "Ziegfeld Follies," a 1946 MGM musical 
extravaganza designed to showcase the studio's glorious stars, offers a 
state-of-the-art lesson in film preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-CAV (full-feature standard play, $90) three-disc boxed set, produced 
by George Feltenstein and Allan Fisch, reveals not only their commitment to 
film history, but also is a signpost in how that history can be packaged when 
not all of the pieces are available. 
</P>
<P>
 The laser disc shows for the first time since early previews what the finished 
film was supposed to look like. The picture elements for all of the "Ziegfeld 
Follies" outtakes were probably destroyed in a studio vault explosion in the 
early 1950s. All that is left are the sound elements, which were stored in a 
different area of the studio, and most of these recordings survive. More than a 
dozen numbers cut from the original are presented on a separate audio analog 
channel, a tantalizing taste of the treasures that were lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The boxed set comes with some of the best detailed liner notes around, which 
make it possible to enjoy not only the preserved film, but also the deleted 
audio sequences. In addition, chapter searches pinpointing every number clearly 
indicate how to find them, including those available only on the audio analog 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 The original film, intended to celebrate the studio's 20th anniversary, was 
budgeted at the then unheard-of cost of $3 million. Filming began in 1944 in an 
attempt to cash in on the successful franchise based on Florenz Ziegfeld's 
spectacular Broadway stage shows. The 1936 biographical film, "The Great 
Ziegfeld," starring William Powell, was a big success, with its rather hokey 
told-from-heaven opening borrowed here. "The Ziegfeld Follies" was designed to 
spotlight MGM's stars, and various sequences were assigned to different 
directors eventually overseen by Vincente Minnelli. 
</P>
<P>
 But when previewed, "The Ziegfeld Follies" was a complete disaster. It was cut 
and re-cut and, after more than two years, finally was released in 1946, 
managing to make a profit even though its final cost had pushed it to $3.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at it nearly half a century later, it has become a musical time 
capsule featuring some of the great dancers, singers and comedians of the time, 
including Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Lucille Bremer, Fanny Brice, Judy Garland, 
Esther Williams and Kathryn Grayson along with those on the rise: Lena Horne, 
Lucille Ball and Cyd Charisse. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrangements by the underrated Kay Thompson, who's also heard on several 
tracks, are clever, and it is fun to see the lineage of Stephen Sondheim's 
"Follies" in Arthur Freed and Roger Edens' "Here's to the Girls," directed by 
George Sidney and featuring the beautiful young ballerina Charisse, and a 
lovely on-horseback beauty in Ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The glory of Technicolor is unmistakable; the laser discs were digitally 
mastered from a new interpositive that was manufactured from the original 
nitrate negatives. Two reels for which the original negative was lost (believed 
destroyed in a fire in the George Eastman House archives in the '70s) were 
reconstructed from safety-positive separations. 
</P>
<P>
 The sound, presented in stereo, was mixed from an early-generation, 
variable-density optical soundtrack. Microphonic "stems" used in the '40s, so 
mixers could create better-balanced monaural tracks, enabled digital remixing 
and editing for this release. 
</P>
<P>
 Another bonus is a copy of the script written for an anticipated Judy 
Garland-Mickey Rooney number, "I Love You More in Technicolor Than I Did in 
Black and White," which was never recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 Other bonuses: a sequence from the documentary "When the Lion Roars," with a 
discussion of the production of "Ziegfeld Follies" by William Tuttle and 
Charisse; the original theatrical trailer, and a variety of stills, including 
some from the deleted sequences lost forever.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; A NEW WAVE OF COMPETITION HOMING IN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the annual Video Software Dealers conventions, retailers gather and fret 
about the latest threat to the lucrative business of renting home videos. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years they were anxious about laser discs and pay-per-view. Neither 
format, though, has made a serious dent in the video rental market. 
</P>
<P>
 What had some of them concerned at the recent convention in Las Vegas was 
RCA's new low-cost home satellite system -- the DSS (digital satellite system). 
Subscribers are able to get scores of channels beamed by satellite through a 
tiny dish that easily attaches to a house. 
</P>
<P>
 The DSS debuted last month in a few cities in the Southeast, such as Jackson, 
Miss., and Shreveport, La., priced in two models at $700 and $900. Dealers in 
these markets report that demand has outstripped supply; they've had to resort 
to waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Nervous video retailers visualize consumers bypassing their stores in favor of 
having movies sent into their homes this way -- particularly after the price 
for the hardware drops into the $300-$400 range. A big selling point is that 
DSS offers an extra-sharp picture and high-quality sound. Another reason for 
the DSS demand is that some people think it's a more affordable version of 
those giant rooftop satellite dishes that pull in signals from all over the 
country; sports fans think they can use it to routinely pick up games outside 
their viewing area. But that's not true. Initially, programming for the DSS 
will be provided only by special networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, Sears is going to carry the DSS system, but a salesman in the Santa 
Monica store reported that there's not even a tentative date yet for when it 
will be in stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Special Interest 
</P>
<P>
 * With Michael Jackson in the news as a newlywed, can sister LaToya be far 
behind? Nope. Her soft-core porn video, "Celebrity Video Centerfold: LaToya 
Jackson," will be out Wednesday on Playboy, priced at $20. The tape consists 
mostly of Jackson baring her body in music-video-style segments. It also 
includes short snippets of her commenting on her life. Posing this way is 
nothing new for Jackson, who's done a layout for Playboy magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 * For the more than 26 million hearing-impaired Americans, there's an 
invaluable guide to the close-captioned tapes on the market. Including more 
than 5,000 titles, "Gopen's Guide to Close Captioned Video" is 560 
well-categorized pages, featuring a synopsis and rating of each entry. Usually 
the only way to find close-captioned videos is to look for labeling on the 
video box. The guide sells for $30, (508) 620-6555. 
</P>
<P>
 * KidVision's has added to its marvelous "There Goes" live-action series, 
which informs kids about various vehicles and machines. "There Goes an 
Airplane" showcases all kinds of airplanes. "There Goes a Police Car" is also 
out. These half-hour videos are priced at $10. 
</P>
<P>
 What's New on Video 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chase" (FoxVideo). A falsely convicted felon (Charlie Sheen) goes on the 
run. After stealing a car and snatching a snooty hostage (Kristy Swanson), he's 
pursued by cops from San Diego to Mexico. Of course, during the long car chase, 
romance blooms between hostage and captor. The film is nutty, improbable and 
geared to the under-25 crowd, featuring bits by rock stars such as Henry 
Rollins and members of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. If you're in the mood for 
mindless escapist fare, this is perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Major League II" (Warner). The 1989 original, about the adventures of a 
motley crew of a baseball team, was far from a great comedy but it was wacky 
fun. This one, about the team losing its edge after a championship season, 
isn't as funny. Charlie Sheen, Corbin Bernsen and Tom Berenger return for the 
sequel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lightning Jack" (HBO). Paul Hogan tries to reincarnate his Crocodile Dundee 
character in this comedy Western. As a bumbling crook who yearns to be a famous 
outlaw, he teams with Cuba Gooding Jr. to rob banks. Renters hoping for a 
lively, Dundee-quality action comedy will be disappointed. "Angie" (Hollywood). 
Geena Davis plays brassy, Brooklyn-born Angie in this comedy/drama, directed by 
Martha Coolidge and geared to the female audience. Dissatisfied with her life, 
Angie agonizes through family problems, boyfriend problems and a childbirth 
tragedy before taking off in search of her long-lost mother. Co-stars Stephen 
Rea and Aida Turturro. 
</P>
<P>
 "My Neighbor Totoro" (FoxVideo, $20). Thoroughly delightful, Japanese-made 
animated feature about the adventures of two young sisters living with their 
father while their mother is in the hospital. In a country house in Japan, 
they're befriended by a magical, furry creature called a totoro , only visible 
to children. Worth seeing just to savor the stunning animation. Caution: While 
stressing family bonding, some sequences, such as the sisters in a hot tub with 
their father, may be unacceptable to some American families. Parent 
pre-screening is advised.

THEATER REVIEWS; SINGING PUTS 'LOST CHILDREN' IN TUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If critics could give an E for Effort, then David A. Lewis' "The Lost 
Children" would get an E-plus. 
</P>
<P>
 But effort alone, alas, does not a play make. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' original children's musical at the Camino Real Playhouse here exudes 
wholesomeness and hard work. But Lewis, who shows genuine talent in crafting 
catchy melodies, has taken on too much with writing the book, music and lyrics 
and directing the show. If anything, he tries too hard, and it's apparent in 
every move "The Lost Children" make. 
</P>
<P>
 The story is a predictable good-versus-evil yarn, a cross between "The Lion, 
the Witch and the Wardrobe" and "The Wizard of Oz," without the subtlety or 
humor to make it fly. And yet, occasionally, when a genuinely original 
character pops up like shy Mr. Wind (delightfully played by Bart McHenry), one 
catches a glint of the golden possibilities submerged in this murky riverbed.  
</P>
<P>
 Like "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" -- a version for which Lewis once 
wrote the music and lyrics -- the story begins with two brothers and their two 
sisters at boarding school. 
</P>
<P>
 After a heavy-handed and remarkably humorless opening in which the 
boarding-school director is cast as an evil man who breaks kids' Power Ranger 
toys, scalps teddy bears and makes the kids go to bed at 7, the children run 
away into the library and disappear into another world. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of landing in C.S. Lewis' Narnia, they wind up in Atlantis, but with 
the same general population of friendly, talking animals. As in Narnia, there 
are creatures who represent good and evil. So instead of Aslan and the White 
Witch, we get Zobel and Diebolt. 
</P>
<P>
 But as in the film version of "The Wizard of Oz," the journey also works as a 
dream; in it, the actor who plays Zobel also plays the kids' father, the actor 
who plays Diebolt also plays the boarding-school director, and the actress who 
plays Atlantis' Ms. Sunbeam also plays their mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The performers tend to overact, but they are, on the whole, among the show's 
assets, particularly in the singing department. 
</P>
<P>
 John Florentin brings a commanding voice to Mr. Reynolds and Zobel; Laura 
Lewis, the playwright's wife, offers a lilting soprano as Mrs. Reynolds and Ms. 
Sunbeam; Diane Milo gives a sweet tang to Ms. Moonbeam and Ms. Barmore; and 
Russ D. Stewart is easy to like as the very appealing, vaudeville-loving, 
half-animal/half-man Mr. Conoaky. Tani Reynolds as Mrs. Rain delivers one of 
the show's sweetest and simplest songs, "A Little Bit of Rain," charmingly a 
cappella. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The children clearly are newcomers to the stage but so fresh-faced, eager and 
sincere that they are beyond reviewing. Perhaps the hardest job of the critic 
is to be greeted after the finale by one of those innocent fresh-scrubbed faces 
rushing off stage and to be asked -- as everyone in the audience was asked -- 
"Did you like it? Did you have a good time?" 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-year-old girl sitting next to me, wearing her best party dress and a 
wide-eyed expression of wonder and delight through most of the action, had no 
problem answering in the most enthusiastic of affirmatives. 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe that is the ideal age from which to view this show. 
</P>

THEATER; 'PHANTOM' STILL RAISING THE RAFTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Midsummer reality check: County theatergoers have money to burn when it comes 
to "The Phantom of the Opera." Last week, Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical 
extravaganza grossed slightly more than $1 million in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this come as a surprise? Not really. But it's not business as usual, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, which runs through Sept. 3 at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, is also averaging about $100,000 a day in box-office walk-ups and phone 
sales. That is roughly four times the amount any Broadway show has done on any 
given day since the center opened eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting close to sold out for the entire run," a center spokesman said 
earlier this week.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a small but steady stream of "Phantom" fans has been showing up 
nightly at the center's stage door. That, too, is not unexpected.  
</P>
<P>
 Most fans want to meet Grant Norman or at least get his autograph, preferably 
on an 8-by-10 glossy. He plays the man in the mask, which makes him the star of 
the show, if you don't count the chandelier. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans did come up with one minor surprise, though, given the center's tight 
stage-door security. Somebody entered Norman's dressing room and made off with 
his bathrobe. "It has his name and the show's logo printed on the back," the 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 AND NOW THIS: In case you haven't noticed, the "Phantom" marketing machine is 
always ready to serve. Restaurants near the center are offering diners pre-show 
musical warm-ups ("Phantom" songs performed cabaret-style by local opera 
singers), raffles for free tickets and bus shuttles. One hotel sold 700 weekend 
packages for "Phantom"-goers to stay the night after the show and soak up the 
glamour of beautiful downtown Costa Mesa.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 GREASE UP: Remember that pale imitation of a Broadway musical called "Grease" 
that graced the center's stage for a week in March? Well, that piece of 
nothing, which did booming business, of course, is doing even better in New 
York this summer. The price of the top "Grease" ticket on Broadway just went 
through the roof. It's $67.50. And some of you thought the "Phantom" top ticket 
($61.25) was highway robbery? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 CATCHING A STREETCAR: Across the street from the center at South Coast 
Repertory, rehearsals began earlier this week for "A Streetcar Named Desire." 
The revival of the Tennessee Williams classic will launch the 1994-95 season 
Sept. 2 on the SCR Mainstage, on the heels of the "Phantom" closing. 
</P>
<P>
 Funny how popular "Streetcar" suddenly is. It's always being revived 
somewhere, but theaters everywhere seem to have gotten the same idea at once. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a rash of 'Streetcars' this season," said Jim O'Quinn, editor of 
American Theatre, the trade magazine. Four productions at regional theaters 
around the country, including SCR's, will open in September alone. 
</P>
<P>
 It's still too early to tell how playgoers are responding to SCR's 
subscription drive, said SCR spokeswoman Madeline Porter. But it looks 
promising -- at least as good as last season, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 As for last season's offerings, the two most popular shows turned out to be "a 
bit of a surprise," Porter said. The top grosser on the Mainstage was Brian 
Friel's "Dancing at Lughnasa" and, on the Second Stage, Athol Fugard's 
"Playland." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, "Lughnasa" turned out to be "one of the biggies of recent years," she 
added. "It's right up there with 'The Crucible' and 'Shadowlands.' " All four 
shows were directed by SCR co-founder Martin Benson.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 BARD BIZ: Shakespeare Orange County, the county's only classical troupe, is 
doing well this summer on several fronts. The company matched its subscription 
goal, signing up 842 season ticket-holders, and exceeded its fund-raising 
projection of $30,000 by more than 50%. It brought in $46,000 in contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Walk-up business for "Twelfth Night," which closes this weekend at the Waltmar 
Theatre in Orange, also has held up. "We've had very good word-of-mouth on the 
show," SOC artistic director Thomas F. Bradac said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hamlet" did better two seasons ago (it's SOC's top grosser), as did "Much Ado 
About Nothing" last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Next up is "King Lear," with Alan Mandell in the starring role. It opens Aug. 
12. If he lives up to expectations and the production matches him, SOC could 
have a new box-office champ.

THEATER REVIEW; THIS WHINY 'JAKE' HAS LOST LAUGHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The more serious Neil Simon becomes, the more intricate are his plays. And the 
potholes lying in wait are better hidden. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Simon is still writing comedies. "Jake's Women," at Orange Coast College, 
is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
 Jake is at war with all of the women in his life, from his current wife to his 
sister, from the memory of his late first wife to his daughter, from his 
analyst to his latest temporary squeeze. It's Thurber for the '90s, is what it 
is. And that's funny. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Simon's semi-autobiographical conceit of having writer Jake continually 
creating imaginary dialogues between himself and his mental clones of his 
ladies is pure Thurber. 
</P>
<P>
 Director John Ferzacca doesn't always see it that way. His view is serious 
indeed, and a lot of the honestly wrought laughs in the script slide by 
unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 David Scaglione, as the one-man army against feminine control, also takes his 
Jake too seriously. Jake is nothing if he doesn't have a sense of humor, and 
Scaglione doesn't have the comic touch that would even make Jake likable. 
</P>
<P>
 His Jake is a whiner and deserves all of his problems. There is little in him 
to make his wife, Maggie, want to return to his side, or to keep his sister in 
his corner. And this weak, self-pitying slob is certainly not the mensch his 
delightful first wife married. 
</P>
<P>
 The women in his life earn points in direct relation to the actresses' 
understanding of the light comedy involved in Simon's parable. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Rowe's Maggie is crisp and has a faint edge of satire in her portrait 
of a career woman entranced by a Manhattan marriage, and Alice Ensor gives a 
charming, bubbly facade to Jake's sister Karen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even Corinne Hart, as Jake's 12-year-old daughter, Molly, catches some of the 
kidding quality of the piece. Lynn Laguna is just fine as a woman Jake dates 
after Maggie leaves. Rachel Stolte, who plays Molly as an adult, doesn't catch 
much of the humor and is rather hard-edged, along with Susan Shearer's analyst, 
a one-note reading that misses altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Nectar Rose has the tone of the play and its sense of humor wrapped up tight. 
As Jake's late first wife, Julie, she lights up the stage, and her buoyant 
flavor almost makes one forget Scaglione's frowns and grimaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Scaglione also designed the set, which looks just right, and works better than 
his Jake. David Dunbrack's lighting and Catherine Labaut's costumes are both on 
target in a staging that misses its bull's-eye. 
</P>
<P>

AN ID-CARD PLAN THAT MAKES SENSE; EASIER WAY FOR EMPLOYERS TO VERIFY WORKER 
STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One big reason political debate about illegal immigration tends to generate so 
much heat and not enough light is because it is too often focused on the wrong 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians who should know better argue over marginal, but highly emotional, 
questions like whether or not immigrants abuse the welfare system while either 
downplaying, or just plain ignoring, the true magnet that draws most illegal 
immigrants to this country: Jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the jobs issue was supposed to have been abated with enactment of 
the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act. This watershed measure made it 
illegal for U.S. employers to hire illegal immigrants. But so many illegal 
immigrants still find work that it's obvious many employers either can't find 
an effective way to comply with IRCA or, worse yet, are ignoring it. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, a Washington panel has come up with a constructive proposal to 
fine-tune that landmark 1986 law. The chairwoman of the little-known but 
potentially important U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, former Rep. 
Barbara Jordan, this week urged Congress to establish a simple but elegant 
experimental program to help employers verify whether newly hired workers are 
in this country legally. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be done not by creating some massive new government program, with 
an inevitable new bureaucracy, but by setting up a database of Social Security 
numbers. Jordan proposes that a pilot program be set up in five states, 
including California, to find the best ways to use the database to verify a 
world-be workers' identity and legality. 
</P>
<P>
 That is an excellent idea -- one that this newspaper has long favored as a 
reasonable way to make IRCA work without discriminating against minorities or 
unduly invading the privacy of U.S. citizens. After all, every legal U.S. 
worker already has a Social Security number that must be given to an employer 
when applying for a job. An accurate database would add only one more step -- 
most likely a quick telephone call or computer check -- to the hiring process. 
That should not be a burden for either employers or legal workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress should move quickly to enact Jordan's proposal when it is formally 
transmitted next month as part of a report to Congress prepared by the 
bipartisan commission she chairs. And we fervently hope that the other 
recommendations the nine-member body makes will be just as constructive. The 
commission is fortunate to include among its members knowledgeable people on 
immigration. And in Jordan it has a chairwoman who is respected on Capitol 
Hill. During her tenure as a Democratic representative from Texas, Jordan was 
admired for a balanced and reasoned approach to the most complex public-policy 
issues. Those are precisely the qualities that can help cool the overheated 
immigration debate.

PRO FOOTBALL IN A CORNER; HENLEY CASE HAS NFL SQUIRMING UNCOMFORTABLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine bringing the family to a National Football League game this fall and 
hearing this by way of a player introduction: "Now playing cornerback for the 
Rams, Darryl Henley, out on bail awaiting trial on charges of masterminding a 
national drug-distribution ring."  
</P>
<P>
 That's not going to happen, of course, but such a public-address announcement 
would be a summary of the discomfiting facts in Henley's situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The accused are innocent until proved guilty, and this should be as true in 
major cases such as Henley's as in minor ones. Moreover, people have to earn a 
living. Thus the NFL has cleared him to play this season while he awaits trial; 
the Rams have signed him to a one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 But playing NFL football isn't just any job: It dominates the American 
landscape on Sunday afternoons in the autumn and early winter. Football players 
are ambassadors for their game. The players appearing in the TV ads for charity 
look terrific, and Henley, for now at least, will look not so terrific.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite its intrinsic violence, professional football has worked overtime to 
package itself as family entertainment. It deserves considerable credit for 
this. It has procedures for those found guilty of drug or alcohol violations. 
Thus it has good reason to set a higher standard for itself than even a court 
would. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for the game, the NFL doesn't have many cases quite like this. The 
courts don't seem to have known quite what to do either; they allowed Henley to 
make bail when ordinary folks in his situation wouldn't have gotten it, and 
indeed while others in the case went to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley is supposed to be confined to a limited geographical area by the terms 
of his bail. But he wants to travel with the team, and since he has met the 
requirements successfully so far, the court will be hard pressed to judge him a 
flight risk. On balance, neither the league nor the courts would appear to have 
any grounds for denying him the right to play. But with the grievous charges, 
it's hard not to note that the Henley case puts the NFL uncomfortably into the 
drug spotlight.

ACHIEVING TRUE JUSTICE IN RWANDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new government of Rwanda wants to bring thousands of killers to justice. 
That is appropriate, for ethnic massacres cannot go unpunished in Africa or 
anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rwandan Patriotic Front, victors in that country's bloody civil war, 
should leave any war-crimes trials to impartial international authorities. Its 
new government, dominated by Tutsi tribe members, cannot risk even the 
appearance of revenge on members of the Hutu tribe. That would discourage 
relief efforts and possibly trigger another cycle of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The world, though slow to give a hand during the Rwandan crisis, is not 
ignoring what the United Nations described as "the planned and concerted" 
killing of an estimated 500,000 Tutsi civilians and their moderate Hutu 
neighbors. On Monday, U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali named three 
African legal experts to investigate reports of genocide and other atrocities. 
A similar approach was recently used in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Security Council set up the Balkans War Crimes Tribunal for "ethnic 
cleansing," murder, rapes and other related offenses committed in Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. That step was viewed last year as historic because it was 
the first international war-crimes tribunal set up since the Nuremberg trials 
at the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Rwanda's nascent government understandably does not want to wait on the United 
Nations. But the Patriotic Front is not exactly blameless in the Rwandan 
conflict. U.N. officials found evidence that it carried out arbitrary 
executions. In this atmosphere, patience is the best prescription for a country 
trying to recover from an unprecedented blood bath. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1 million Rwandans fled the chaos. Among the refugees are defeated 
soldiers who are evading justice. Anywhere from 20,000 to 40,000 Hutu soldiers 
fled to Zaire, for example. They have not relinquished their antagonisms or 
their promise to retake Rwanda. These former soldiers are not innocent 
refugees. Many are war criminals standing in line next to people who were their 
victims. These are the people the Rwandan government wants to put on trial. But 
it cannot act on its own. To do so would only make reconciliation more 
difficult between Hutus and Tutsis, and make peace all but impossible in the 
country they all call home.

POLICE WATCH; CANDID CAMERA

<TEXT>
<P>
 Another grainy videotape -- one that appears to show a police officer beating 
a suspect with a series of flagrant baton blows to the head and a dropped knee 
to the neck -- has understandably stirred up outrage, shock and concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are already comparing last Friday's incident, in which Compton police 
officer Michael Jackson violently subdued 17-year-old Felipe Soltero, with the 
taped beating of Rodney King by four Los Angeles police officers in March, 
1991.But while it's easy to draw parallels between the incidents, it's also 
important to be mindful of the differences. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the swift official response. On Wednesday, two days after the release 
of the videotape, the FBI and the Los Angeles County district attorney launched 
separate investigations into possible civil-rights violations and charges of 
police brutality. The speed of the federal and local response is welcome and 
reassuring, particularly at a time of sporadic tension between ethnic groups in 
Southern California. In the Compton case, the officer was African American and 
the suspect Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this case points up the necessity, especially in a diverse community, 
for continual police education. Reports of the Christopher and Kolts 
commissions have proved extremely valuable and instructive for larger 
law-enforcement agencies like the Los Angeles Police Department and the county 
Sheriff's Department. But if this videotape is an accurate depiction of what 
happened, the same thing needs to happen in some smaller jurisdictions, like 
Compton.

LEONARD BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the editorial (July 30) about the FBI keeping a file on Leonard Bernstein, 
you are many years late, and thousands of people short. As a leading newspaper, 
you should have led a crusade against the government spying on any people, 
instead of whimpering about a musician being included among the "communist 
spies" three decades after his file was begun. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing slanderous about being a communist. They have always been on 
the side of worker and peasant. There are no communist spies (there may be 
spies from other countries, but there are no spies among communists in the U.S. 
other than those planted by the FBI (CIA, etc.). I suppose the FBI will copy 
this letter and put it in the 1,300-plus-page file it has on me -- a nobody. 
</P>
<P>
 THEODORE W. HOOKER 
</P>
<P>
 La Puente 
</P>
<P>
 I find a certain irony in "ACLU Reveals FBI's Files on Bernstein" (July 29).  
</P>
<P>
 While there is not the slightest accusation that Bernstein was involved in 
anything but a misguided belief in what has now been manifestly shown to be a 
failed and discredited form of government, the FBI was and is clearly entitled 
to keep records on whomever it deems worthy of vigilance. Such records are kept 
confidential except when such organizations as the ACLU, or The Times, reveal 
details. Only then are aspersions implicitly cast upon the reputation of public 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of such surveillance shows up in the sparse number of acts of 
terrorism that occur in this country compared with other freedom-loving 
countries. Witness the speed with which arrests were made in the New York Trade 
Center bombing, and the frustration of the planned bombing at the U.N. 
building. The FBI clearly has an important role to play and should not be 
demeaned by such groups as the ACLU.

RELIGIOUS RIGHT AND DEMOCRATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I must thank you for running next to each other "Dissatisfied Americans May 
Spell Democrat Losses" and "GOP Moderates Warn of Religious Right Takeover" 
(July 28). Each told a different side of the same story. As you note, I see 
both Democrats and "moderate" Republicans striving to create bogymen of 
conservatives with values grounded in their faith in God. Neither 
fear-mongering group will succeed because Americans are not afraid of 
leadership that stands and fights for values that are consistent with their 
religious faith. 
</P>
<P>
 George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. all did the 
same, using their faith in God as the foundation for actions that liberated 
nations and races. Our hope today lies with men and women who will do the same.

 I am continually amused by the number of benevolent Democrats who, I'm sure 
out of genuine concern for the well-being of the Republican Party, continue to 
alert the American people of the imminent takeover of the GOP by radical 
right-wing religious fundamentalists. The chorus, up until now, was composed of 
Rep. Vic Fazio (D-West Sacramento), Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders and even 
President Clinton. Now The Times has joined in this effort to "save" the 
Republican Party.  
</P>
<P>
 It strikes me as ironic, however, that directly above your article on the GOP 
is an article detailing the recent Times Poll, which found that "strikingly, 
more Americans display concern about the political influence of culturally 
divisive groups associated with the Democrats . . . i.e., feminists and gay 
activists." I believe the Democrats are preaching to their own liberal 
Democratic choir when voicing concerns about the religious right. This moderate 
Republican is not a convert to their cause. I am much more comfortable with the 
views of the so-called radical right-wing religious fundamentalists, who preach 
moral absolution and personal responsibility, than I am with the views of the 
radical left-wing atheist liberals who preach moral relativism and economic 
injustice.

 Regarding your poll: Before people get too disappointed in Clinton, I suggest 
they take a look at the obstructionist tactics utilized by the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been a registered Republican all my life, and am almost ashamed to 
admit it. As I recall, President Clinton's economic program was blocked by the 
Republican filibuster, of which the illustrious Sen. Bob Dole was so proud, in 
the name of partisan politics, totally disregarding and putting the success of 
his party before the best interests of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Before, voting in more Republicans, I suggest we put the blame for any lack of 
accomplishments by Clinton where it belongs -- on Dole and the obstructionist 
philosophy of the Republican Party.

ATTACK ON ARGENTINE JEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a human being first and an Argentinian Jew second, I am appalled and 
shocked in the aftermath of the tragedy that occurred in Buenos Aires July 18. 
Ninety-six people are dead, most of them Jewish. This is the second attempt 
against the Jewish community that has occurred in the last two years. At that 
time the Israeli embassy in Argentina was blown apart, causing severe 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 As I talked to some of my relatives and friends, the consensus was that the 
people of the Jewish community there live in a state of siege. They are afraid 
to leave their own homes. The silence and lack of preventive measures either by 
the Argentinian government or Israel create more uncertainty and fear among the 
community. I wonder how Israel would have reacted if the victims were Israeli 
Jews rather than Argentinian Jews. Are they afraid to jeopardize the peace 
treaty with the Arabs? 
</P>
<P>
 Should the Argentinian Jews become the martyrs of Israel's peace effort 
without Israel offering some respite to them by helping them adopt stringent 
security measures to protect themselves? No peace treaty is worthy when it is 
marred by the bloodshed of 96 innocent people who happened to be on the 
opposite side of the earth from Israel.  
</P>
<P>
 The Jewish people in Buenos Aires need immediate attention by both the 
Argentinian and the Israeli governments. It is time for Israel to show that 
their interest in Jews goes beyond the confines of their own territory. 
</P>
<P>
 ENRIQUE J. FRIEDMAN

<P>
 The obscene terrorists responsible for the bombing of a building housing the 
Jewish community center in Buenos Aires and the murder of 96 persons have done 
Israel and true friends of Israel a favor. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 10 months, since the foolish and irresponsible Rabin-Arafat 
handshake on the White House lawn, the Rabin government has acceded to a long 
litany of concessions to the Palestinian Arabs, jeopardizing Israel's security 
and endangering the lives and welfare of more than 140,000 Jewish residents of 
ancient Jewish territories of Judea, Samaria and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 This policy of "land for peace," the mantra of the peace movement, is based on 
the assumption that Israel's peace and security depend primarily on relations 
with the Palestinian Arabs. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buenos Aires bombing is a reminder that the real threat to Israel and to 
Middle East peace lies not in Amman, or Jericho, or Gaza City, but rather in 
Baghdad and Tehran.

DRUG CONTROL POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I, too, applaud the RAND Corp.'s study on controlling cocaine. I agree with 
your article (June 14) and editorial, "How to Be Effective Against Cocaine" 
(June 16), as well as the RAND study, which support more funds for 
treatment.However, Congress does not seem to agree. Out of the $355 million 
President Clinton has requested to expand drug treatment opportunities, 
Congress has only approved $61 million.  
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 national drug control strategy makes treatment of chronic, hard-core 
drug users one of its top priorities. The President's fiscal-year 1995 drug 
control budget request reflects this by requesting a record $355 million for 
treatment of hard-core users.  
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, this Administration realizes the importance of a balanced 
approach to the drug crisis in our country. Treatment alone cannot solve the 
drug problem. Supply control also plays an important role. We will continue to 
have effective supply-reduction programs, such as interdiction and source 
country programs. This is not an "either-or" debate. An effective national drug 
control strategy cannot be accomplished by funding some effective programs at 
the expense of others. The balanced approach we seek does not mean abandoning 
supply-reduction activities. It means giving appropriate weight to each of the 
demand-and-supply elements that, in concert, contribute to the comprehensive 
approach required. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of the 1994 national drug control strategy cannot be realized 
without proper funding and a commitment from Congress to reduce drug use and 
its availability in our country.

JUROR ANONYMITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I applaud Los Cerritos Municipal Court presiding Judge Philip Mautino's use of 
blanket jury anonymity in criminal cases (July 25). Society appears to be in 
the grip of urban terrorism wherein an entire city, let alone an individual, 
can be subjected to mob coercion, violence or threats in the performance of 
lawful civic duties producing results that are at odds with the sentiments of 
any restive element of the populace.We're headed toward anarchy and the judge's 
action has established a landmark of hope for a turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 The juror must be protected from terrorism or society will devolve into the 
lawlessness of our past where might made right. I hope that Judge Mautino's 
courageous act will be viewed as an appropriate solution to an essentially new 
social phenomenon and universally implemented within the criminal justice 
system.

A FULL-FLOWERING PEACE IS STARTING TO BUD; MIDDLE EAST: THE CLINTON 
ADMINISTRATION HAS A GOOD EYE FOR THE STEPS THAT CAN BRING ISRAEL AND THE ARAB 
STATES TOGETHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE McGOVERN, George McGovern, former senator from South Dakota and 1972 
Democratic presidential nominee, is president of the Middle East Policy 
Council, a nonprofit public-interest interest group in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has taken some knocks for its handling of foreign 
policy in Haiti, Bosnia and North Korea. But it is on the road to success in 
the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 In its support of the Israeli-PLO agreement for Palestinian self-rule in the 
Gaza Strip and Jericho and in bringing Jordan's King Hussein and Israel's Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin together for their public pledge to make peace, the 
Administration has taken important steps in bolstering moderates and 
undercutting extremists.  
</P>
<P>
 To further blunt the resentment that kindles extremism and violence, our 
policy must be to promote peace, economic development and political 
participation in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 It is important to understand that when people are poor and powerless, they 
may turn to extremism and violence to change their circumstances. This is true 
whether we are talking about the Gaza Strip, southern Lebanon or the South 
Bronx. Extremism is not an inherent feature of Islam. It grows out of 
suffering. So in confronting the threat of extremist Islamic movements or 
extremist secular movements, we should alleviate the root causes of their 
extremism: poverty, corruption and repression. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has recognized this and should be especially 
commended for pledging $500 million over five years to build a Palestinian 
self-governing body and rehabilitate the devastated Palestinian economy. 
Careful spending of these funds will be key to the success of Palestinian 
self-rule, as will democratic elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has also worked wisely to assure neighboring Arab 
governments that we are committed to a comprehensive peace that includes them. 
In particular, it is engaged in detailed discussions meant to build on Israel's 
willingness to withdraw gradually from the Golan Heights, Syria's willingness 
to normalize relations gradually, and the interest of both parties in 
international, including American, security guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 Success in mediating land-for-peace agreements between Israel and Jordan, 
Syria and Lebanon as well as a final agreement that extends Palestinian 
self-rule throughout most of the West Bank will further undercut extremists. 
Already, the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) is splitting 
between those who are willing to accept the interim agreement with Israel and 
those who still reject it. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the terrorist attacks against Jewish offices in Buenos Aires and London 
appear to be an extension of the still unresolved conflict between Israel and 
the Iranian-backed Party of God (Hezbollah) in Lebanon. The attacks are 
evidently the promised retaliation for a recent Israeli attack on a Hezbollah 
base and the kidnaping of a Hezbollah leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon and from Syria's Golan Heights in 
return for secure peace agreements will diminish Hezbollah's grievances and end 
Syria's rationale for tolerating guerrilla operations from southern Lebanon by 
Hezbollah and other extremist movements. This will reduce, but not eliminate, 
the opportunities for factions in Iran to support attacks against Israel. We 
will make it harder for Iranian extremists to fish in troubled waters by doing 
something to calm the waters. This is an integral part of an effort to contain 
Iran's extremist elements. 
</P>
<P>
 Arab-Israeli peace will bring about the economic growth and prosperity that 
has been blocked by decades of war and civil strife. It will finally permit the 
removal of needless barriers to trade and investment, the sharing of water 
resources and the reduction of military spending. Israel and most of its Arab 
neighbors will benefit from these developments. 
</P>
<P>
 These developments will in turn lead to more open political systems in the 
Arab world. The political inclusion practiced in Jordan, where King Hussein has 
opened the Parliament to moderate Islamist candidates, will survive and be an 
attractive model. Elections in Lebanon and in Israel are likely to be won by 
moderates. Authoritarian military leaders will no longer be able to justify 
their rule by pointing to an Israeli threat. In time, economic intercourse and 
liberalization will create movement toward political liberalization even in 
Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the Middle East, dialogue and cooperation with Islamist moderates 
-- and foreign economic aid -- may be the only chance Algeria's secular 
government has to undercut surging Islamic extremists. But it may be too late 
there. Meanwhile, Egypt's secular government should take care not to turn its 
drive against Islamist militants into a drive against Islamist moderates. 
Algeria shows that repression does not work; it makes people more resentful and 
dedicated to revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardship and repression have bred extremism in the Middle East. During the 
Cold War, a fear that the Soviets were behind unrest in the Third World made it 
hard for many to see or sympathize with this. Now, a pervasive misunderstanding 
of Islam makes it hard to see. But Clinton Administration officials see it and 
know that they have to help relieve these conditions to pave the way for 
moderation.

CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY; 'THREE STRIKES' IS WORKING, BUT WHO'S GOING TO PAY THE 
BILL?; MORE THAN 6,000 CASES HAVE BEEN FILED IN L.A. COUNTY ALONE, CLOGGING THE 
SYSTEM FROM D.A.'S OFFICE TO COURTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GIL GARCETTI, Gil Garcetti is district attorney of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the five months since the "three strikes and you're out" bill was signed 
into law, many people have speculated about its potential effect on the 
criminal-justice system. My educated guesses about what might happen are 
becoming reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Between March 7, when this law went into effect, and July 29, my office has 
filed 749 "third-strike" cases, 1,998 "second-strike" cases and 3,469 
"first-strike" cases. Second- and third-strike convictions carry enhanced 
penalties: double the usual term for a second strike and 25 years to life for a 
third strike. Obviously, a criminal defendant who is facing such harsh 
penalties will be less likely to plead guilty. Criminal cases are beginning to 
back up and clog our already overburdened court system. Many more cases will go 
to trial than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 What does this mean for the District Attorney's office? In April, I reached an 
agreement with the Board of Supervisors to accept a budget for the coming year 
at the same level as last year. The fallout from "three strikes," however, was 
not taken into account. My office was recently audited by the Grand Jury. The 
conclusion: We are grossly understaffed and underfinanced. We simply do not 
have the resources to handle the increasing workload caused by "three strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 The new law does change the criminal- justice system, but at a cost. It will 
cost taxpayers a great deal to provide the additional prosecutors, public 
defenders and courts needed to handle the vastly increased trial workload that 
this law is creating. And the price tag on incarcerating increased numbers of 
prisoners will obviously be very high, too. It is my sincere hope that our 
citizens, acting through their elected officials, will provide the funds 
necessary to meet the burdens of the "three strikes" law. It is imperative that 
the funds do not come at the expense of education or health services, for that 
will simply perpetuate cycles of criminality and we will never be able to build 
enough prisons.  
</P>
<P>
 Some have suggested that the application of this law will result in Draconian 
sentences being imposed on hapless criminals who commit minor crimes (but who, 
of course, have prior convictions for serious or violent crimes). I am doing my 
utmost to see that no miscarriages of justice occur. What many people do not 
know is that the law gives prosecutors the discretion to strike a prior 
conviction "in the furtherance of justice." It is always the duty of my office 
to seek justice. If a defense attorney believes that a wholly inappropriate 
sentence will result from his or her client's conviction, my prosecutors will 
consider the arguments presented. In fact, in a comprehensive policy I issued 
on "three strikes," I gave my prosecutors guidelines to follow when considering 
whether a prior should be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep in mind, however, that we will not dismiss priors or plea bargain in 
inappropriate cases. What I require of my prosecutors is the exercise of their 
judgment to fulfill our ultimate goal: protection of the public. Repeat 
offenders who pose a threat to our community will be treated as the law 
requires.  
</P>
<P>
 I believe the "three strikes" law was passed because the citizens of this 
state were tired of a criminal-justice system that imposed lenient sentences on 
violent criminals; tired of a system that had a prison revolving-door policy 
that did not punish or deter; tired of a criminal-justice system that certainly 
did not protect citizens from violent criminals. There are cases in which 
prosecutors have always wanted to be able to put criminals behind bars for much 
longer sentences than the courts would impose, and this law has given them the 
opportunity to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 I remain in favor of the "three strikes" concept. It is my obligation to 
enforce the law, and I will do so vigorously and fairly, but I will also 
continue to be heard. I don't foresee any substantial change in the near 
future; and if anyone currently charged with a second- or third-strike felony 
hopes there is going to be a quick change, he or she has a long wait.

WEATHER SLOWS 2 WESTERN WILDFIRES; NEW BLAZES START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Firefighters gained ground on two major wildfires in central Washington on 
Thursday, but lightning storms sweeping over the Pacific Northwest sparked more 
than 150 new blazes, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like we're in for a long siege," said Sam Logan of the National 
Interagency Fire Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the new fires in Washington, Idaho and British Columbia were small, 
but one, the Swamp Creek blaze in eastern Oregon, had grown to at least 34,000 
acres in just two days. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 20,000 men and women, including 3,570 Army, Marine and National Guard 
personnel, were fighting 26 major blazes and hundreds of small fires in Oregon, 
Washington, Idaho, Montana, California, Utah and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Fires covering more than 233,000 acres continue to burn out of control, 
including more than 159,000 acres in Washington alone, where Interior Secretary 
Bruce Babbitt joined Native Americans fighting a fire on the Yakama 
reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooler weather and higher humidity in Washington's Cascade Range helped those 
battling the Tyee Creek fire and the Hatchery Creek Complex fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The 105,960-acre Tyee Creek fire had threatened the resort town of Chelan and 
Lake Chelan's south shore before beginning to move in a more westerly 
direction. Its western edge crept to within 11 miles of Leavenworth, which was 
already under siege by the 26,755-acre Hatchery Creek Complex fire, but was not 
expected to threaten the town. Fire lines now surround 68% of the Tyee Creek 
fire and 25% of the Hatchery Creek Complex fire, said Rinee Merritt of the 
Multi-agency Coordinating Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The fires have driven hundreds from their homes, forced the closure of major 
state highways and destroyed at least 37 houses and more than 75 other 
structures.

NASA ROBOT STALLS ON ITS WAY OUT OF ALASKAN VOLCANO 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After successfully spider-walking its way inside the Mt. Spurr volcano, the 
$1.7-million Dante II robot was halted in its tracks on the way out Thursday, 
apparently by an electrical short. 
</P>
<P>
 Technicians were watching the robot ascend the volcano's 20- to 30-degree 
slope when the screen suddenly went dark, said Dave Lavery, a National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration robotics program director. The robot 
stalled about 650 feet from the rim. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavery said the problem is probably a bad cable leading to Dante's diesel 
generator. 
</P>
<P>
 The generator powered the eight-legged robot over snow and around boulders to 
reach the crater floor earlier this week in a journey that began July 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists may try to fly to the crater, which sits at 6,500 feet, to see if 
the robot can be reactivated. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA scientists came to Mt. Spurr, 80 miles west of Anchorage, for terrain 
similar to what could be faced by a robot sent to explore distant planets. 
</P>
<P>
 The machine was operated partly by remote control from Anchorage and NASA's 
Ames Research Center in California.

NEW JERSEY MAN FACES CHARGES FOR KILLING RAT

 Frank Balun faces charges of needlessly killing a rat that was eating his 
tomato plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Balun, 69, says he caught the rat and called the Humane Society to remove it 
from his squirrel trap. Then the rat tried to escape before help arrived, so he 
whacked it with a broom handle. The Associated Humane Societies slapped him 
with two summonses and he has to appear in court Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is absolutely preposterous," said Angelo Bonano, administrator for the 
Hillside Board of Health. "We encourage people to kill rats because they carry 
disease."

WOLFRAM KANDINSKY; NARRATOR OF AUDIO BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wolfram Kandinsky, 52, known for his reading of "Lonesome Dove" and other 
well-known audio books. Born Daniel Grace, Kandinsky graduated from St. Louis 
University and became a Shakespearean actor.But he found his metier as a 
narrator. Working with his Miro Recordings, Kandinsky became one of the first 
narrators for Books on Tape in 1975. He read some 200 unabridged books into 
microphones, including the work of Larry McMurtry, James Faulkner, Ernest 
Hemingway and his own favorite author, Joseph Conrad. The Times' former arts 
editor Charles Champlin, in reviewing Kandinsky's reading of McMurtry's 
"Cadillac Jack," wrote that the narrator "has a laconic voice and a subtle 
command of American regional accents that fits the material like a caressing 
glove." In reviewing the taped version of McMurtry's classic "Lonesome Dove," 
Champlin called Kandinsky's narrative voice "thin and hard as a strand of fence 
wire and just right for these proceedings." On July 6 in Wayne County, Ga., 
after a long illness.

AIRLINE FINED $140,000 FOR 32 PUPPY DEATHS

 Delta Air Lines has been ordered to pay fines totaling $140,000 for the 
suffocation deaths of 32 puppies on a St. Louis-to-Salt Lake flight four years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The penalty was levied by the Agriculture Department for violation of the 
Animal Welfare Act on June 6, 1990, when Delta transported 108 dogs and cats in 
58 kennels. The Boeing 737 cargo compartment apparently didn't have enough 
oxygen to keep the animals healthy when the flight was delayed more than two 
hours because of weather.

RECREATION IS MORE THAN FUN AND GAMES; PARKS: RESTORING YOUTH PROGRAMS IS 
CRITICAL TO IMPROVING THE INNER CITY'S QUALITY OF LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLYLE W. HALL JR. and JACK FOLEY, Carlyle W. Hall Jr. is president of 
People for Parks. Jack Foley teaches leisure studies and recreation at Cal 
State Northridge.

<P>
 When Paul Alba went to work on June 28, he went to save lives. Instead, he may 
lose his. 
</P>
<P>
 Alba, 29, is a lifeguard at the Will Rogers Park swimming pool in Watts. He is 
a role model for the community -- a hero who willingly stepped in to protect a 
13-year-old being "initiated" by older gang members. Other gang members scaled 
the pool fence and severely beat Alba. He is still in a coma. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a three-day period of Alba's attack, five other lifeguards also were 
beaten by gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 New admission fees have contributed to the atmosphere of "haves" in the pool 
and "have nots" outside the fence. After the fees were adopted in April, 
attendance at the pool dropped from 600 a day to 300; after the attacks on the 
lifeguards, attendance dropped to 50 a day.  
</P>
<P>
 Even though Supervisor Yvonne Burke has persuaded corporate donors to defray 
fees at inner-city pools this year, recreation, parks and youth service 
agencies in Los Angeles County are in danger. Consider the following: the 
budget for the Los Angeles Unified School District's youth services program, 
which offers an array of arts, crafts and sports after school and during 
vacations, has decreased from $17 million to $6 million in the past decade. 
Also, in the past 10 years, the city's parks have lost half of the 4,000 
full-time staff, many of whom were recreation specialists. Since the 
tax-cutting Proposition 13 was passed in 1978, the county parks have lost 1,400 
of their 2,200 employees. Nonprofit youth agencies also are struggling because 
of the four-year recession. 
</P>
<P>
 User fees and adult volunteers help alleviate the cuts in funding, but in many 
areas, especially the low-income neighborhoods, volunteers are not available 
and families cannot afford user fees.  
</P>
<P>
 Public recreation, though poorly funded, is the only game in town. Two recent 
national studies from the Carnegie Foundation and the Trust for Public Land 
document the decline of organized recreation nationwide. Carnegie notes that 
teen-agers have five hours of unsupervised time each day, time that is too 
often occupied by negative recreation -- gang-banging, drug use and early 
sexual activity. The Trust for Public Land has found that youth crime drops 
when adequate recreational opportunities are available in low-income 
neighborhoods. Both studies conclude that, though the demand for recreation is 
strong, cuts and civic apathy have scrambled the supply. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent Times Poll, Los Angeles residents ranked parks and recreation 
second out of 14 elements that provide a satisfying life in Southern 
California. Proposition A secured 64% of the vote for the successful 
$540-million Safe Neighborhood Parks and Open Space Act of 1992. In 1993, a 
poll taken for Rebuild L.A. interviewed 1,000 people living in the riot zones; 
they ranked youth services and park and recreation facilities as the two most 
desired government services in their community. 
</P>
<P>
 While politicians have been slow to respond, many agencies and grass-roots 
groups are fighting to save parks and youth programs. People for Parks, a 
nonprofit, multiethnic organization, has observed this problem and has launched 
the Campaign to Reinvent Urban Recreation in Los Angeles. We will have a 
day-long conference Saturday at the William O. Douglas Outdoor Classroom at 
Upper Franklin Canyon Park, West Hollywood. The idea is to provide services of 
social and economic value through building partnerships that involve 
grass-roots organizations, police, politicians, business leaders, 
environmentalists and nonprofit and public agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Ashe in his biography commented on the ability of recreation programs 
to increase life chances. While he noted that recreation cannot solve all the 
problems of the modern, urban world, Ashe declared that "we have an obligation 
to do something to counter this social and spiritual plague. Too many people 
have given up." 
</P>
<P>
 We don't feel that Los Angeles is ready to give up on the Paul Albas and the 
young people who use the Will Rogers pool. We just need to get organized.

TENNIS / L.A. OPEN; BECKER FINDS ANOTHER LEVEL IN VICTORY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Boris Becker, looking to regain his form before the U.S. Open begins Aug. 29, 
survived a second-round challenge Thursday to defeat Chuck Adams 7-6 (7-4), 6-1 
in the $313,000 Los Angeles Open. 
</P>
<P>
 In other matches, No. 6 Jason Stoltenberg of Australia defeated Steve Bryan 
7-6 (8-6), 6-3 and Karsten Braasch, the eighth seed from Germany, got by 
qualifier Steve Campbell 6-4, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-seeded Andre Agassi played Greg Rusedski of Canada in a night match. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker, the No. 2 seed whose world ranking has dropped to 11th, traded breaks 
with Adams in the fourth and fifth games of the first set. They stayed on serve 
until the 12th game when Becker trailed 30-15 on his serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams' backhand hit the line and was called good. But the chair umpire 
overruled and ordered the point replayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker responded with an ace to hold serve and went on to win the tiebreaker 
7-4. The German ran off five straight games in the second set before Adams 
finally held serve in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always interesting to play Chuck," Becker said. "We have played before 
in the juniors. I kept playing better and better as the match went on. I would 
start serving better and he kind of put his head down." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams, from nearby Pacific Palisades, said Becker transformed his play after 
the first set. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was sluggish to begin with but once he gets going he's hard to beat," 
Adams said. "He moved it up a few notches." 
</P>
<P>
 Becker's off-court distractions increased last winter when he got married and 
became a father. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm on my way back up," he said. "With each match I'm getting better. 
I believe that I have a couple of big tournaments left in me. The U.S. Open is 
one I'd like to win."

 SCIENCE HALL OF FAME: It was 20 years ago that UCI chemistry professor F. 
Sherwood Rowland and one of his graduate students discovered that 
chlorofluorocarbons deplete the ozone layer. Now they're getting high-class 
recognition -- a permanent exhibit about the discovery at the Smithsonian 
Institution in Washington. . . . It's part of the new "Science in American 
Life" exhibit at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. It 
includes photos, graphics and reports of Rowland's work.

 FIGHTING BACK: The war against graffiti vandals is far from over, but Anaheim 
officials are boasting some good news: Their graffiti hot line calls are down 
44% from last year. . . . Code enforcement supervisor Richard LaRochelle says 
it's a combination of education programs and volunteer groups that are 
"removing graffiti before anyone has a chance to call it in." Last month alone, 
the city used 400 gallons of paint in graffiti cleanup.

 JOURNAL'S LADY: The cover of this month's Ladies' Home Journal may be Kathie 
Lee Gifford, but inside the magazine, it's Debbie Aguirre who gets much of the 
praise. . . . Aguirre owns Tierra Pacifica, an Irvine design and construction 
firm that parlays work into community deeds. It's restoring a historic office 
building in Pasadena, for example, but also renovating a battered women's 
shelter there for free. Aguirre says she didn't want to separate her corporate 
life from her community interests: "I wanted to blend it all in."

 TINY SHOW: Twelve inches may equal a foot in real life, but in miniature, a 
foot is just one inch. They've got miniatures by the thousands at both the Inn 
at the Park and Marriott hotels in Anaheim this week. The Marriott's huge 
public show is Sunday afternoon. The attraction? Says Betty Martin of Solvang, 
an exhibitor who's been collecting for 42 years: "Anything that's small is cute 
-- a baby, a puppy. And anything big that's made to be small is especially 
cute."

 SECURITY: Jews everywhere are pretty nervous these days, and with good cause 
-- the recent bombings in Argentina, Panama and England. So, on Thursday, 
Jewish groups attended a security seminar in Encino (B1). . . . Valley Jewish 
institutions, says Tzivia Schwartz, the Anti-Defamation League's counsel in Los 
Angeles, have been hit hard in recent years by vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 NIGHT FEVER: Everyone poked fun at disco, and why not? Still, now it's 
nostalgia, and some Valley clubs have brought it back (Valley Life! Page 3). . 
. . John Dunn, owner of Insomnia Cafe in Sherman Oaks and an ex-DJ, says the 
Valley was hot for disco. The Sugar Shack in North Hollywood, he said, "was 
real important. It was the place for the younger crowd that lived the '70s." 
</P>
<P>
 EXPLOSION: Northridge's Jonah Weiland, 22, (above) reads comic books -- lots 
of them. And he is hardly alone. The Valley offers more than two dozen shops 
selling comics and related items (Valley Life! Page 10). . . . Although comics 
began nearly 100 years ago as reprints of newspaper strips, the first -- "Comic 
Monthly" -- that resembled today's modern style appeared in 1922. 
</P>
<P>
 TRASH ELSEWHERE: Actor Ed Begley Jr. is a man of many causes, but his latest 
is a bunch of garbage. Household trash, to be more exact. Begley, arguing 
against new landfills, boasted this week to county supervisors that because of 
recycling, "I throw away one glove compartment's worth of garbage every week." 
. . . Well, could he prove it? The Times went to his Studio City home to find 
out (B1). 
</P>
<P>
 GHOST TOWN: What's in a name? A lot, apparently. The term ghost towns , used 
to describe blocks of quake-damaged Valley buildings, was the brainchild of 
Gary Squier, head of housing for the city of Los Angeles (B1). . . . At first, 
one of his bosses, City Councilman Richard Alarcon, thought that it was "too 
negative." But he now agrees that it's helped get government attention. Michael

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; ATTACK ON CHP OFFICER RAISES

 A California Highway Patrol officer was attacked and severely beaten Monday by 
a motorist nearly twice her size, authorities said. Pulled over for going 80 
m.p.h. in a 55 m.p.h. zone, Ronald Arnett Coleman, an ex-convict from Palmdale, 
allegedly became argumentative when Officer Amy Bonilla attempted to administer 
a field sobriety test to see if he had been drinking. He lunged at her and, 
after unsuccessfully attempting to pull Bonilla's baton and gun away, wrestled 
her to the ground and began punching her in the face, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before three passing motorists were able to subdue him, Coleman -- at 5 feet, 
10 inches tall and 205 pounds -- had Bonilla -- 5 feet, 5 inches and 110 pounds 
-- pinned to the road and was pummeling her with both fists, authorities said. 
They said Bonilla followed standard operating procedures in the incident.

 Should physical requirements for law enforcement officers be raised? 
</P>
<P>
 Robert J. Barry, director emeritus of USC's Center for Administration of 
Justice 
</P>
<P>
 The height and weight of an officer are not considered to be related to the 
performance of his or her duties. . . . It shouldn't even be a question of 
height or weight. The real question should address standard operating 
procedures. Those procedures include calling for backup when you see yourself 
in a potentially dangerous situation. Or, controlling someone with a shotgun if 
there is reason to feel threatened. She could have told him to stay in the car 
and should have called in his license plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Jo Anne Darcy, Santa Clarita mayor pro tem 
</P>
<P>
 "The girl has my frame and even a little taller. It just seems to put a person 
of that stature in a position that seems questionable at best. I would prefer 
to have seen her with another officer, and even they take a chance. I realize 
that women in today's world are stronger and try harder. . . . I personally 
would rather have seen her with another officer just in case something like 
that would happen. She didn't even have time to call in for help. I don't think 
even changing her training would matter. The fact that she maintained her gun 
and stature gives credit to the CHP. Even two women would have had a better 
chance. But I give her an 'A' for effort, for bravery and for doing her job." 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Jerry Skaggs, commanding officer, Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department Training Bureau 
</P>
<P>
 "The standards we have for females are the same we have for males. They are 
all evaluated equally. Most of our additional requirements have to do with 
background, character and psychology. Once an individual passes the minimum 
physical threshold, he or she goes through a background process that is geared 
toward personal history, psychology and so forth. It is not unusual, in our 
department, for an officer to be assigned to solo duty in a two-officer vehicle 
-- particularly if its a unit assigned to traffic responsibilities. If, 
however, we see that officers in another department were negatively affected by 
procedures similar to ours, it would be natural for us to re-evaluate our own 
system of procedure." 
</P>
<P>
 Tammy Bruce, president of the Los Angeles Chapter, National Organization for 
Women 
</P>
<P>
 "Not unless you look at all the instances where male officers were attacked by 
perpetrators twice their size should this be an issue. What we need to do is 
change the mentality of people thinking they can attack an officer with 
impunity and attacking a woman with impunity. The LAPD and the CHP could change 
that by hiring more women officers and people would grow accustomed to 
respecting them as such. It's unfortunate because when this happens to a man 
you say that the perpetrator was a bad guy and that's all. I guarantee that the 
same CHP officer has handled threatening situations effectively in the past. If 
you look at the record for the last six months you'll find instances where male 
officers don't win."

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: ANNUAL HOME SHOW TO OPEN TODAY AT CSUN 
</P>

<P>
 It's purely coincidence that their first San Fernando Valley appearance is 
practically at the epicenter of the nation's costliest disaster, but organizers 
of an annual home show in its 18th year certainly aren't complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning at noon today and running through dusk Sunday, about 400 home repair 
and remodeling businesses will peddle their wares and services on the campus of 
Cal State Northridge as part of a giant home show that usually attracts about 
40,000 people to the Los Angeles Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Valley residents whom organizers are expecting to attend face 
massive, unplanned home-improvement projects as a result of the Jan. 17 
earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 "Here's the Valley, with 50,000 homes damaged," said Dan Greene, head of the 
NEC group Inc., the marketing organization that puts on the home show every 
year. "This is one place where they can get absolutely everything they need . . 
. from roofs to rose gardens." 
</P>
<P>
 The show usually is held at the Los Angeles Convention Center, but organizers 
had scheduled their first Valley appearance just before the quake hit.  
</P>
<P>
 The show features every aspect of home repair and remodeling, starting with 
banks that offer loans. About 10 Valley restaurants will also be represented in 
a mini "Taste of the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 A portion of the proceeds will go to a local organization for earthquake 
recovery. Admission is $5.75 for adults. SUSAN BYRNES

POLITICAL BRIEFING: WRIGHT'S STRATEGIST SEES CLINTON FOMENTING 
COUNTERREVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 THE WRIGHT STUFF?: To hear John Theiss tell it, a conservative revolution is 
in the making and President Bill Clinton is the key ingredient. 
</P>
<P>
 His recipe for change goes like this: Add a hefty measure of Republican 
discontent to a Democratic presidency, stir up the issues and what do you get? 
</P>
<P>
 A GOP voter revolt. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, this is what campaign director Theiss forecasts for his boss, state 
Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), in her bid for lieutenant governor. The 
backlash he envisions would carry Wright and all other Republican candidates 
into office. And it would occur regardless of Gov. Pete Wilson's popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of coattails, it's going to be a clean sweep," Theiss predicts. 
"Having President Clinton in the White House has done more to help Republicans 
than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives are mobilizing like never before, he says, particularly in their 
support of efforts to crack down on criminals and ward off government attempts 
at gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those people have never been as active as now. Never in my past experience 
have I seen this," Theiss says. "It's almost to the point they are rabid. They 
are so mad, so scared, they are literally out to take back their government." 
</P>
<P>
 And Wright, with her belief that individual entrepreneurship will triumph over 
government interference, is aiming for their support. 
</P>
<P>
 To reach these voters, Wright's campaign organization has signed on seven 
field staffers throughout California. And Wright, whose district lies 40% in 
the San Fernando Valley area and 60% in Ventura County, is spending a lot of 
time crisscrossing the state.  
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics of the revolution point out, however, that Wright's opponent, state 
Controller Gray Davis, has the highest name identification -- 71% -- of anyone 
in the seven statewide races besides governor and U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, Davis' campaign bank account in June totaled more than $2.3 million, 
dwarfing Wright's treasure chest of $9,839. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative voters may be angry, but Davis still leads Wright by 30 points in 
the latest Field Poll. 
</P>

 UNDERDOG REDUX: After trouncing the Valley's state Sen. David A. Roberti in a 
nasty primary bout over the Democratic nomination for state treasurer, Phil 
Angelides apparently faces another uphill fight. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Field Poll, the Sacramento developer was the least known 
among major candidates running for statewide office. Of 14 politicians, 
Angelides scored the lowest, with only 12% of respondents saying they knew 
enough about him to have an impression. 
</P>
<P>
 His Republican opponent, Matt Fong, a member of the Board of Equalization, was 
known to 34% of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Democrats may recall Angelides as the outsider who ousted longtime pol 
Roberti in a low-blow swipe at the Van Nuys Democrat's antiabortion views. The 
developer's TV commercials suggested that Roberti condoned the slaying of a 
Florida doctor who performed abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Angelides wants to be known as an industrious newcomer who pulled off a 
stunning upset. 
</P>
<P>
 Says his campaign update: "As in the primary, Phil starts out as the underdog 
in his race for treasurer." 
</P>
<P>
 And, as in the primary, the campaign looks to be shaping up as another down 
and dirty brawl. 
</P>
<P>
 State Democratic Party official Bob Mulholland has already demanded in a 
letter that Fong make public all his office and travel expenses for the past 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats want Fong to cough up documentation of his every move and 
expenditure while traveling for the state. If he refuses, Mulholland said, 
voters can assume "he's guilty. We're going to be after him like a mosquito in 
a swamp." 
</P>
<P>
 And the charges? Democrats believe that Fong has "overspent tax dollars, he's 
enjoyed the good life and the perks" while serving his elected term on the 
Board of Equalization, Mulholland says. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, "we want to find out if Matt Fong, while on the road, is renting 'Bambi' 
videos or 'Debbie Does Dallas.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That's no idle threat. Angelides was chairman of the California Democratic 
Party when Mulholland similarly targeted U.S. Senate candidate Bruce 
Herschensohn -- though Angelides denied approving it. 
</P>
<P>
 It was four days before the 1992 election when Mulholland crashed a 
Herschensohn campaign event, waving around a photo of a nude-dancing club that 
Herschensohn had visited. Many Republicans and Democrats alike viewed the 
eleventh-hour tactic as a watershed event in smear campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's desperate and these are desperate tactics," Fong says of his 
opponent. "I would expect more of the same kind of sleaze that you saw him use 
against Sen. Roberti." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 CLOCK IS TICKING: Meanwhile, Roberti, who has been keeping a low profile in 
the Capitol for the first time in decades, is pondering what to do for a career 
come December, now that his political clock has run out. 
</P>
<P>
 The official word is that the lawyer-politician with the Perry Mason voice is 
shopping for offers from law firms. Whatever he ends up with is likely to pay a 
lot better than the $52,500 a year lawmakers make. 
</P>
<P>
 Capitol insiders note that, late last year, Roberti was very close to 
accepting a lucrative post in business when he entertained an offer from the 
Modesto-based Gallo winemakers to be their chief political coordinator. That 
job was said to be worth at least $300,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti staffers say their boss won't be talking much about his future until 
the legislative session is over next month. 
</P>

 SENOR ROBBINS: Former state Sen. Alan Robbins has put the worst of his legal 
troubles -- his prison sentence, that is -- behind him and is focused on 
winning a pack of lawsuits he's filed against former business partners. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not so easy to shake a bad-guy image and move on when details of your 
crimes are continually rehashed in public. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a thing happened recently in Costa Rica, where a judge went on and on 
about the misdeeds of Robbins and former state Sen. Paul Carpenter in 
connection with their campanas politicas.  
</P>
<P>
 San Jose Judge Arnoldo Alvarez de Santi was justifying his decision to allow 
Carpenter's extradition back to the United States by laying out the two amigos' 
extortion scheme in nine meticulously detailed pages. Carpenter, who fled to 
Costa Rica to escape sentencing, was Robbins' cohort in a plot to launder 
campaign contributions for personal use. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Robbins, who represented the Valley in the Legislature for nearly two 
decades, is trying to live down the legacy of his later years in power -- in 
part by paying off the remainder of his $3.3-million debt to the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 A portion of the restitution is expected from the sale of his historic Encino 
estate, which was once occupied by a relative of Los Angeles Mayor John Porter, 
who led the city from 1929 to 1933. 
</P>
<P>
 The home is becoming more affordable this week. After six months on the market 
at $1.3 million, the price is dropping to a nudge over $1 million. 
</P>

 DESOLATION ROW: It is a term headline writers dream of: "ghost town." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Gary Squier came up with to describe the blocks of vacant, 
earthquake-damaged buildings that have been infiltrated by vagrants, drug 
dealers and gangbangers. Squier -- the head of housing for the city -- says the 
name came to him as he drove with other housing officials through the eerie, 
dilapidated apartments. Aside from making for splashy headlines, the name stuck 
because the buildings do indeed bring to mind abandoned towns of the Old West. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone likes the label, including one of Squier's bosses. City 
Councilman Richard Alarcon, whose northeast San Fernando Valley district 
includes two of the so-called ghost towns, complained to Squier early on that 
he thought the term was "too negative." Now, Alarcon says he still doesn't like 
the term much but concedes that the negative spin attracted some pretty 
valuable attention. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, in a telephone conference call with Mayor Richard Riordan 
Tuesday, announced he would seek to free another $225 million in federal 
earthquake relief money, primarily to pay for loans to repair "ghost town" 
buildings.

DREAM DEBUT VERY NEARLY A NIGHTMARE; BASKETBALL: U.S. TRAILS SURPRISING SPAIN 
AT ONE POINT IN FIRST HALF BEFORE PULLING AWAY FOR A 115-100 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Here's another difference between these squads. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dream Team warmed up in Monaco amid the casinos and topless sunbathers on 
the Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
 Son of Dream Team opened Thursday night in a half-empty arena in this 
blue-collar city on the shore of Lake Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid suitably threadbare surroundings, the U.S. began play in the World Cup 
with a lackluster 115-100 victory over unheralded Spain, which is not expected 
to play in the medal round. If there had been a spread, the Americans would 
have missed it by 29 points. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the average margin of victory of the Dream Team at the 1992 Olympics, 
44 points. No opponent scored more than 85 on the Americans at Barcelona and 
none ever led as late as Spain did Thursday when it went up, 42-41, with 5:27 
left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dream Team's smallest margin of victory was 32 points, over Croatia in the 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dream Team also never had a player unhappy over playing time or a coach 
who suggested he couldn't get through to his players, but Son of Dream Team had 
both: a gloomy Dominique Wilkins and a frazzled Don Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have many great individual players," Nelson said. "We have to learn to 
play as a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not an easy lesson to learn. You can talk 'til you're blue in the face 
but they have to experience it and see for themselves. It doesn't happen in two 
weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson started Reggie Miller at forward in a three-guard lineup, hoping to 
knock Spain off balance with quickness, but it never happened. The day may have 
passed when clumsy Europeans struggled to bring the ball up against greyhound 
American guards or maybe Nelson's players weren't into it, but the Spaniards 
sneered at their pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans, warned over and over they have to guard everyone on the 
perimeter in the international game with its three-point line at 20-feet-7 -- 
three feet shorter than the NBA -- had to experience that for themselves, too. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first half, a 7-footer named Ferran Martinez scored 10 points while 
Shaquille O'Neal and Alonzo Mourning guarded the lane. In one stretch, Spain 
scored on 16 of 19 possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the whole flow of European basketball kind of threw us for a loss," 
starting point guard Kevin Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't get a read defensively. Big guys normally have a tendency to help 
out in the paint, but you can't leave their big guys because they shoot that 
college three-pointer like they're free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally when you have guard penetration, the other guard helps out, which is 
what you've been told to do your whole life. They kick it out to a guy shooting 
a three-pointer." 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, Nelson actually told his players not to press as hard and 
finally American depth told, if not in the earth-flattening style of 
you-know-whom two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. went up by 23, then nodded off once more and Spain closed within 15 
at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed," said Miller, who scored 21 points. "This is a great 
wake-up call for us. This is something we definitely needed. Everybody has been 
patting us on the back and catering to us. Hopefully we'll pick up the papers 
tomorrow and get something else." 
</P>
<P>
 They'll get more than that. They'll see their first hint of ego conflict, 
manifested by Wilkins, trying to suck it up but plainly unhappy after being 
kept out until the last seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 This was better than Steve Smith, who didn't get in until the last five. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson noted he couldn't play everybody -- and added he was going by the merit 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to look back to our training camp," Nelson said, "and decide who were 
our best players there. Those 10 players were basically playing better there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm planning on basically staying with this rotation. I like this rotation 
very much. It's not that they (Wilkins and Smith) won't be part of it because 
they will be, but they're going to be in more of a reserve role." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wilkins: "Of course, it'd be hard for me if I don't play. You know, I've 
paid my dues in this league. I deserve the right to be here and the right to 
play. But if that's his decision, hey, no problem, I'm cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from that, it was another totally dominating night in international 
basketball for the U.S. pros. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a 20-point lead," said Nelson, trailing assurances in his wake. "I 
think we could have won handily if I would have kept the pressure on and left 
the starters in the game. I chose not to do that and I think it's a good lesson 
for us to learn." Basketball Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In Thursday's other Pool A game, China made 12 of 15 free throws in overtime 
to beat Brazil, 97-93. . . . In Pool B, Croatia beat Cuba, 85-65, as Dino Radja 
of the Boston Celtics had 25 points and eight rebounds. Croatia's NBA frontline 
of Radja, Toni Kukoc of the Chicago Bulls and Stojan Vrankovic, formerly of the 
Celtics, finished with a 45-20 rebound advantage. Australia hung on to beat 
South Korea, 87-85, scoring only one point over the final six minutes as South 
Korea closed an 86-71 deficit to 86-85 with 55 seconds to play. Andrew Gaze, 
who finished with 31 points, made one free throw with 13 seconds left and South 
Korea missed a final three-pointer. . . . In Pool C, Russia beat Argentina, 
84-64, as Yevgeni Kissourin had 19 points. Joey Vickery came off the bench to 
score 14 points in Canada's 83-52 rout of Angola. . . . In Pool D, Jose Ortiz 
had 19 points to lead six scorers in double figures as Goodwill Games champion 
Puerto Rico cruised past Egypt, 102-74. Panagiotis Fassoulas had 18 points and 
10 rebounds to lead Greece to a 68-58 victory over Germany.

DODGERS HIT THE ROAD, UNSURE IF THEY'LL BE BACK; BASEBALL: GROSS PITCHES EIGHT 
INNINGS OF 1-0 VICTORY OVER PADRES. NEXT HOME GAME IS SCHEDULED FOR AUG. 12. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As a song by The Clash blared in the Dodger clubhouse Thursday morning -- 
"Should I Stay or Should I Go?" -- the players began arriving. Some showed up 
early, others at the appointed time, but all with the same question: Will we 
play or will we go? 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers came to the stadium not knowing if they were about to play in 
their last game, or if there would even be a game. They were packed for their 
coming trip, in case there was one. And while they were waiting for player 
representative Brett Butler to arrive and tell them the latest news on the 
impending players' strike, some packed for the season, in case there wasn't 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never knew I had so many batting gloves," pitcher Tom Candiotti said 
shortly before the Dodgers beat the San Diego Padres, 1-0, in front of an 
afternoon crowd of 45,183. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, who had voted unanimously the day before to move up the strike 
date, found out from a televised news conference two hours before the game that 
they would take the field. Mad as they are, union chief Donald Fehr said, the 
players will wait until Aug. 12 to strike, trying to settle their differences 
with the owners in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
 That decided, clubhouse assistant Pete Sandoval grabbed a piece of chalk and 
wrote on the blackboard, "Pack your bags and bats." Later, someone had 
scribbled underneath, "See you next spring." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers left for a six-game trip after the game, possibly having played 
their last game at Dodger Stadium this season. After a three-game series 
against the Colorado Rockies and another against the Cincinnati Reds, they are 
scheduled to begin their next home stand on, well, Aug. 12. But for now, they 
are still atop the National League West, with a 2 1/2-game lead over the San 
Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking that we weren't going to play this weekend, but I came today 
and prepared myself the way I normally do on the days I pitch," said Gross 
(9-7), who didn't appear to be the least bit distracted.  
</P>
<P>
 Gross pitched eight shutout innings, giving up six hits and at one point 
retiring 14 consecutive batters. He said he could have stayed in, but supported 
the decision to turn the game over to Todd Worrell in the ninth inning. Worrell 
retired the side in order for his ninth save. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was one of those games when neither starter should have lost, Padre 
Andy Benes (6-13) making only one mistake in seven innings -- on a pitch to 
Mike Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza, leading off the fourth inning, sent a soaring drive over the 
center-field fence, hitting the ball even before the public-address announcer 
finished introducing him. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Benes) hit my bat, I guess, I don't know," said Piazza, who is batting .330 
with 24 home runs and 89 runs batted in. "Like I have said before, Benes is one 
of the better pitchers in the league and we had our opportunities -- with the 
bases loaded (in the sixth) and two outs. 
</P>
<P>
 "But our pitching kept us in the game. (Gross) was on today. . . . He was 
getting ahead of guys and getting his curveball over and spotting his pitches 
well inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Gross' only jam came in the seventh inning when he loaded the bases with one 
out on three hits. 
</P>
<P>
 He induced Billy Bean to pop up to Delino DeShields, before Padre Manager Jim 
Riggleman pulled out the stops, sending in Tony Gwynn to pinch-hit for Archi 
Cianfrocco. Gwynn, who had been taking the day off, was ahead of Gross, 2 and 
0, before hitting a line drive down the left-field line that sliced just foul. 
Gwynn then flied out to center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, with facing Gwynn, the situation was not too exciting, and then 
there was that close call down the line," Piazza said. "Fortunately, Gross got 
a cut fastball down and in, and Gwynn hit it up. The guy is hitting (almost) 
.400, and six out of 10 times he's going to make an out; fortunately, it was 
one of those times." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the players said they were surprised that the strike date wasn't moved 
up, but said what had transpired would not affect the way they play the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a job to do," Butler said, "and (Dodger owner) Peter O'Malley pays us 
a sum of money, a great deal of money, to go out and perform on the field, and 
we are going to be professionals and live up to that obligation and go out and 
play as hard as we can, like nothing has happened."

WITH RESENTMENT HIGH, MARINERS SWEEP ANGELS; BASEBALL: SEATTLE WINS, 4-2. 
STRIKE SENTIMENT STRONG; DISARCINA SAYS OWNERS' FAILURE TO MAKE PENSION PAYMENT 
WAS 'GASOLINE ON THE FIRE.'

 The Angels may have been back on the field Thursday, but they proclaimed they 
can no longer trust baseball ownership, and predicted a hostile strike that 
will last a minimum of two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two sides now are more apart than ever," said Angel shortstop Gary 
DiSarcina, assistant player representative. "I think we'll be out at least two 
weeks now. Before, I thought it might be a lot less, but not now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who lost to the Seattle Mariners, 4-2, in front of 12,222 at 
Anaheim Stadium, went along with the union's decision not to strike today and 
will wait until Aug. 12. Still, they remain angered at baseball ownership's 
decision not to make a scheduled payment to the players' pension program. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we acted out of emotion," Angel second baseman Harold Reynolds said, "none 
of us would be here today." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mark Langston, Angel player representative: "Players were so infuriated, 
they were ready to walk out now. We're not about to be bullied by their 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to get something done, but right now it's very difficult for me to 
see that something will get resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the Angels' frustration is caused by the fact that they were beginning 
to trust ownership. Angel owners Gene and Jackie Autry, in fact, even invited 
Langston and DiSarcina to their hotel suite last week when the team was in 
Texas. Jackie Autry explained the Angels' position, insisting a salary cap and 
revenue sharing are needed to stay competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a good, positive meeting with her," DiSarcina said, "and she told us 
how she wants to put collusion and distrust behind. You want to believe, and 
then, two, three days later, we don't get our pension. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like gasoline was thrown on the fire. I mean, you sit here and listen 
to how they talk, how they want to earn our trust, and it's all (garbage). 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you be partner with people that do that, and then screw with our 
pension plan? That's money that goes to our families. To play with the players' 
families, that goes beyond hardball. That's dirty." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, considering the way the Angels (44-65) are playing, the front 
office could wonder if the players are holding up their end of the bargain. The 
Angels, who have lost 11 of their last 14 games, now have the worst record in 
the American League at a season-low 21 games under .500, their worst record at 
this juncture since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being grateful that the players will continue playing until at 
least Aug. 12, who could blame management if they were irritated the players 
didn't strike? 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the pennant race from hell, and look at us," Angel Manager Bill 
Bavasi said. "It's very, very frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 So, someone jokingly asked, he was not disturbed by negotiator Richard 
Ravitch's decision to stop pension payments? 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would I be (teed) at that," Bavasi said, "after watching this for (three) 
days. I wonder if he's teed at me for putting this thing together." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps even more painful is that things could get worse, depending on the 
length of the strike. If the strike lasts the rest of the season, sources say 
the Angels are projecting losses of $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "A strike will put us very deep in the red," said Angel President Richard 
Brown, declining to be specific. "Just say it will cost us lots and lots of 
money. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is bigger than the players. It's bigger than the owners. It's going 
to survive somehow, it's just a matter of how many casualties (the strike) will 
take with them." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the Angels must abide by the decision of the Major League 
Players Assn. and continue to play games until the strike. They managed to lose 
their latest game when pinch-hitter Eric Anthony hit a two-run homer in the 
eighth inning off closer Mark Leiter, and a 2-1 lead became a 4-2 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to go out and screw something up already," said Leiter, who 
just last week was promoted to the role. "It's depressing. I feel like a 
field-goal kicker who just blew the game."

SANCHEZ VICARIO, SWAMPED EARLY, RALLIES TO SURVIVE WERDEL SCARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After losing the first set in straight games, second-ranked Arantxa Sanchez 
Vicario rebounded to beat Marianne Werdel, 0-6, 6-4, 6-4, Thursday to reach the 
quarterfinals of the Toshiba Tennis Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Werdel, ranked 49th, survived one match point on her serve to cut her deficit 
to 5-4 in the third set and then another in the next game before Sanchez 
Vicario closed the match on her serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Werdel, an eighth-year pro from nearby Oceanside, won 26 of 34 points in the 
first set, largely with sharp placement shots in her first meeting with Sanchez 
Vicario, the French Open champion. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory sets up Sanchez Vicario and Germany's Christina Singer in today's 
quarterfinals of the $400,000 event at La Costa Resort & Spa. Singer advanced 
with a 6-4, 6-0, victory over seventh-seeded Sabine Appelmans of Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-ranked Conchita Martinez topped Ginger Helgeson, 6-4, 6-3, and will face 
fifth-seeded Jana Novotna, who recorded a 6-0, 6-1 victory over ninth-seeded 
Iva Majoli in 41 minutes. Sixth-seeded Julie Halard also advanced, beating 
Natalia Medvedeva, 6-2, 6-3, for a quarterfinal matchup with top-ranked Steffi 
Graf. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late match, fourth-seeded Lindsay Davenport beat Ann Grossman, 6-1, 
6-2, but a muscle strain in her left leg could prevent her from meeting Tami 
Whitlinger-Jones, ranked 83rd. Whitlinger-Jones advanced when Angelica Gavaldon 
retired because of lower back strain with the score 6-2, 3-0.

TENNIS / L.A. OPEN; AUSSIE FARM BOY READY TO TAKE ON AGASSI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hard courts of North America are a far cry from the ant-bed courts of the 
outback in Australia, where Jason Stoltenberg grew up playing tennis. But he 
has been making himself right at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltenberg defeated Steve Bryan, 7-6 (8-6), 6-3, Thursday in the second round 
of the Los Angeles Open at UCLA's L.A. Tennis Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltenberg stalled with a 3-0 lead in the second set, allowing 87th-ranked 
Bryan to tie the score. But Stoltenberg broke Bryan's serve on a passing shot 
and went on to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltenberg, ranked 26th, has been on a hot streak during the past month. 
</P>
<P>
 He has advanced to finals in the last two tournaments in which he has played, 
losing to fourth-ranked Stefan Edberg in the final of the Legg Mason tournament 
in Washington on July 24 and to 15th-ranked Andre Agassi in the final of the 
Players Limited International tournament in Toronto on July 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth-seeded Stoltenberg will play third-seeded Agassi tonight at 7:30 in the 
quarterfinals. Agassi defeated 61st-ranked Greg Rusedski of Canada, 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 In another match, second-seeded Boris Becker defeated Chuck Adams, 7-6 (7-4), 
6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be great for me to get another crack at (Agassi)," Stoltenberg said, 
"because this is one (tournament) I would really like to win. I felt last week 
I had a good chance, but I didn't quite make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltenberg, 24, is a good rival for Agassi, a high-profile player who is in 
dire need of a sparring partner. Stoltenberg's down-to-earth, Australian charm 
is the perfect counterpart to Agassi's American rock-star image. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltenberg's father, Robert, managed a cotton farm in the bush of Narrabri, 
New South Wales, in Australia. Robert leveled the dirt outside the family's 
home and made a court of ant bed, a fine, clay-like substance that is popular 
in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltenberg and his three sisters played tennis every day while his father 
worked on the farm. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stoltenberg quickly became too good for the makeshift court. In 1985 he 
moved to Sydney, where he lived with Todd Woodbridge. Stoltenberg became the 
top-ranked junior player in the world in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden fame rattled Stoltenberg, however, and he had difficulty 
maintaining his focus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't quite ready for the attention I got at that time," Stoltenberg said. 
"I don't think I was really mature enough or old enough to really take 
advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltenberg turned professional in 1987, but didn't become successful until 
after having arthroscopic surgery for a rotator-cuff injury in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get an injury and (tennis) is taken away from you, you realize how 
much you miss it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltenberg returned in 1993 and won his first singles title on the ATP tour, 
the Manchester Open. He hasn't slowed down since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't be happier," Stoltenberg said. "I'm just enjoying being able to 
play so many matches. . . . A lot of it comes down to confidence and just 
getting on a roll." 
</P>
<P>
 Becker started slowly against Adams but won the tiebreaker on an overhead slam 
and cruised easily through the second set. 
</P>
<P>
 "He kind of put his head down after he lost the first set, and that's not a 
very good sign in a best-of-three set match, and I took the opportunity," 
Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams, who is from Pacific Palisades, said that even though Becker appeared 
sluggish at the start of the match, he has a good chance to win the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boris is one of these guys, the first couple matches he kind of struggles 
through it, gets a little lucky, and then, all of a sudden, the next thing you 
know he is, like, winning the tournament," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker will play a fellow German, eighth-seeded Karsten Braasch, in today's 
quarterfinals at about 2 p.m.

 Heavy rain that flooded fairways and filled sand traps at Warwick Hills Golf 
and Country Club in Grand Blanc, Mich., washed out Thursday's first round of 
the Buick Open golf tournament and delayed Paul Azinger's long-awaited 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger has been away from the game for nine months after undergoing six 
months of chemotherapy, followed by radiation treatment, for the cancer in his 
right shoulder. He then had a non-malignant fatty tumor, unrelated to the 
cancer, removed from his left side. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, he was to have teed off in a competitive event for the first time 
since last November, but the rain intervened. After shooting a one-under-par 71 
in Wednesday's pro-am, Azinger pronounced himself cured.

MORNING BRIEFING: POSTMAN RINGS FOR THE RAMS IN BALTIMORE

<TEXT>
<P>
 An organized group of Baltimore sports fans has begun a postcard-writing 
campaign to Ram owner Georgia Frontiere and club executive John Shaw, trying to 
convince them to move the team from Anaheim to Baltimore.  
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Hand, a retired Baltimore firefighter who heads the "Rite to the Rams" 
drive, said more than 800 postcards have been sent, all with personal messages. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, agent Leigh Steinberg is continuing his effort to keep the team in 
Anaheim but concedes it's a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shaw is open about talking to us, but he's indicated the train was moving 
down the tracks toward the team moving," Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: In baseball's only double no-hit game, in 1917, Fred Toney of

 Pulling for Gehrig: Tommy Henrich, 81, is one of the last major leaguers who 
can tell a firsthand story of Lou Gehrig.  
</P>
<P>
 Henrich, who lives in Dewey, Ariz., was a late-1930s Gehrig teammate. He has 
followed Cal Ripken's pursuit of Gehrig's record 2,130 consecutive games 
playing streak with interest.  
</P>
<P>
 "Because of my past history with the Yankees, Lou Gehrig and all that great 
tradition, I want that record to stay with Lou Gehrig," Henrich told The 
Baltimore Sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'll tell you what, my hat is off to Cal Ripken if he pulls it off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It amazes me that a shortstop is doing it -- that's the most amazing thing. 
There's more activity at that position than any except catcher. He's in danger 
every doggone day, guys sliding into him, whatever. That's what makes it, to 
me, all the more remarkable."

 Song poll: The Notre Dame Victory March -- "Cheer, cheer for old Notre Dame .

 Get outta here!One recent day in The Times sports department, a young man 
identified himself as a longtime Giant fan. Minutes later, it was discovered he

<P>
 The 24-hour channel will show classic games, old series, documentaries and

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: STRIKE IS A SUBJECT SCULLY WOULD JUST AS SOON IGNORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There seems to be a growing apathy over baseball's labor strife. Maybe it's 
simply that a lot of people don't care if there's a baseball strike. Football 
is right around the corner, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 But in these parts, one thing that would be missed is the golden voice of Vin 
Scully. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing quite like listening to Scully, still the master of his craft, 
call a Dodger game on radio or television on a warm summer evening. 
</P>
<P>
 As he prepared for a broadcast at Dodger Stadium the other night, Scully was 
asked about the looming strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it happens, it will be a shame," he said. "What else is there to say? I'm 
not taking sides, and I have no inside information or any great insights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only know what I read. Like everybody else, I can only hope that something 
can be worked out." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Scully had to deal with a midseason strike was in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 He took some criticism, particularly from then-Times columnist Scott Ostler, 
because the night before the strike, he virtually ignored it during a telecast 
from St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Scully, Ross Porter and Jerry Doggett made no mention of a possible strike. 
They did, however, talk about various promotions for the next home stand, 
which, of course, never took place. 
</P>
<P>
 Scully, recalling that night, said he didn't want to detract from a game in 
which Jerry Reuss pitched a three-hitter and retired 22 Cardinals in a row from 
the first to the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strike situation had been covered thoroughly," Scully said. "There was 
nothing else to report. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a case of us trying to cover anything up. As far as we knew, there 
might have been an 11th-hour settlement. We had to carry on as if that might 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 13 years later, the players are expected to go on strike again next 
Friday, after the Dodgers play a non-televised day game Thursday in Cincinnati. 
Scully said he will again treat it as if there might be a last-minute 
resolution. But it appears that is only wishful thinking.

 Powerful piece: An issue in our society that is a lot more pressing than any 
proposed baseball salary cap is domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Its connections to sports was dealt with this week in an excellent feature by 
ESPN's Andrea Kremer. It was first aired on Tuesday's SportsCenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Kremer, who spent a month putting it together, interviewed two women who had 
been beaten by Lewis Billups, former cornerback with the Cincinnati Bengals, 
who was killed in a car accident last April. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracey Fair, who dated Billups, said that one time seven years ago she was 
beaten by him for 3 1/2 hours, mainly taking blows to the head. He also cut off 
her hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair said he told her, "I'll make you so ugly no one will want to be with 
you!" She has since had six plastic surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Chapman, the sister of basketball's Rex Chapman, was engaged to Billups. 
She said she still fears him even though he is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Also interviewed was Vance Johnson, former Denver Bronco wide receiver now 
with the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who has been in treatment for three years and is now in his third 
marriage, said he would become violent when things weren't going well. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he believed he had to be angry to play football, and to feel that 
anger he would get into a fight with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Kremer said it was difficult to get victims of domestic violence to talk 
because of fear of retaliation. Fair and Chapman agreed to talk only because 
Billups is dead. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Radio goofiness: XTRA's Lee Hamilton and Jim Rome have been going at each 
other the past few weeks, and it's not all just for show. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton last week read a fax from a listener that said, "Clean up Southern 
California -- napalm the jungle." The jungle, of course, is Rome's domain. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton also called his younger colleague "a whiny, runny-nosed 4-11 twerp." 
</P>
<P>
 "He ran to management after that," Hamilton said. "He can dish out the smack 
but he sure can't take it." 
</P>
<P>
 The feud should fizzle a bit because Hamilton, the radio voice of the 
Chargers, will be in Berlin next week preparing for the team's exhibition game 
against the New York Giants on Aug. 13. He will still do the first two hours of 
his daily 4-8 p.m. show, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlin time, he'll be on the air from 1 to 3 a.m. "I'll be closing the pubs 
and opening the phone lines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Schwartz will be co-host of the shows with Hamilton and then go it alone 
the final two hours. The "Sports Doctor," John Chlesnik, will fill in for 
Schwartz on his 8 p.m.-midnight show. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz recently returned to nights after a stint in the mornings. His former 
partner, Steve Mason, and John Ireland have taken over the morning slot. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Schwartz's strengths is that he relies on cleverness and ingenuity and 
leaves the name-calling and crudeness to others. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz showed some of that ingenuity last Friday night when he zinged 
Hamilton, who was in Canton, Ohio, with the Chargers for the Hall of Fame game. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz called the Chargers' hotel and, claiming to be Hamilton, ordered a 
$39 breakfast that included vodka and beer. Only problem was Hamilton wasn't 
staying at the Chargers' hotel.

 Hamilton never got the breakfast, but he said he's going to stick Schwartz 
with the bill anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Schwartz: Besides getting his own nighttime show, Schwartz is also going 
to be a part of XTRA's UCLA football broadcast team, joining Chris Roberts and 
David Norrie. 
</P>
<P>
 XTRA, which has acquired the UCLA football and basketball rights, added 
Schwartz, a UCLA alumnus, to give the station a presence on the broadcasts. 
XTRA originally sought to hire a new talk-show host who would also do the UCLA 
play-by-play, but the station failed to find someone who met UCLA's approval. 
So Roberts is back as the play-by-play announcer. 
</P>
<P>
 Tentatively, the way it will work is this: Schwartz will do a Saturday Bruin 
talk show, then join Norrie for the pregame show, and during the game he'll 
also be in the booth. How much of a role he will play there is to be 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
 XTRA's Steve Hartman, another UCLA alumnus, will do a postgame Bruin talk 
show.

 Angel reliever Joe Grahe, who always has wanted to return to the starting 
rotation, might receive his wish, Manager Marcel Lachemann said. In fact, if 
Phil Leftwich (sore shoulder) had been unable to pitch on the side Thursday in 
preparation for his Sunday start, Grahe would have replaced him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deep down, it's something I've always wanted to try again," Grahe said. "If 
it didn't work out, I could put it to rest, but I would like to try it." 
</P>
<P>
 Grahe last started in 1992 before becoming the Angels' stopper when Bryan 
Harvey went on the disabled list. He has saved 13 games in 19 opportunities, 
but has lost his role as closer to Mark Leiter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, I haven't contributed to the team the way I've wanted to," Grahe 
said. "Maybe I can contribute better this way."

 Kent Hrbek, who at 34 has spent his entire career in the Minnesota Twins 
organization, announced Thursday that he will retire at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hitting the ball off the (outfield) wall and not being able to make it to 
second base, I don't like that," said Hrbek."And I can't play first base like I 
used to. It's not that I really wanted to, but I think I had to. I wasn't doing 
the job."

 Hrbek and outfielder Kirby Puckett were the only Twins remaining from the 1987 
World Series championship team.

 In anticipation of a baseball strike, the Boston Red Sox sent a pair of young 
pitchers to the minors Thursday and called up two more expensive players. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox sent Tim VanEgmond and Nate Minchey -- both won starts this week 
-- to Pawtucket of the International League and called up relievers Todd 
Frohwirth and Ricky Trlicek. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a players' strike starting Aug. 12, players in the minor leagues 
will continue to play and be paid. Major leaguers will not be paid during the 
strike.

ANGELS PREDICT HOSTILE STRIKE; BASEBALL: PLAYERS PROCLAIM DISTRUST OF 
OWNERSHIP. TEAM LOSES TO MARINERS, 4-2, BEFORE ONLY 12,222. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels may have been back on the field Thursday, but they proclaimed they 
can no longer trust baseball ownership, and predicted a hostile strike that 
will endure a minimum of two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two sides now are more apart than ever," said Angel shortstop Gary 
DiSarcina, assistant player representative. "I think we'll be out at least two 
weeks now. Before, I thought it might be a lot less, but not now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who lost 4-2 to the Seattle Mariners in front of 12,222 at Anaheim 
Stadium, chose not to strike today and will wait until Aug. 12. Still, they 
remain angered at baseball ownership's decision not to make their scheduled 
payment to the players' pension program. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we acted out of emotion," Angel second baseman Harold Reynolds said, "none 
of us would be here today." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mark Langston, Angel player representative: "Players were so infuriated, 
they were ready to walk out now. We're not about to be bullied by their 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to get something done, but right now it's very difficult for me to 
see that something will get resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the Angels' frustration lies in the fact that they were beginning to 
trust ownership. Angel owners Gene and Jackie Autry, in fact, even invited 
Langston and DiSarcina to their hotel suite last week when the team was in 
Texas. Jackie Autry explained the Angels' position, insisting a salary cap and 
revenue sharing is needed to stay competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a good, positive meeting with her," DiSarcina said, "and she told us 
how she wants to put collusion and distrust behind. You want to believe, and 
then, two, three days later, we don't get our pension. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like gasoline was thrown on the fire. I mean, you sit here and listen 
to how they talk, how they want to earn our trust, and it's all (garbage). 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you be partners with people that do that, and then screw with our 
pension plan? That's money that goes to our families. To play with the players' 
families, that goes beyond hardball. That's dirty." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, considering the way the Angels (44-65) are playing, the front 
office wonders if the players are holding up their end of the bargain. The 
Angels, who have lost 11 of their last 14 games now have the worst record in 
the American League at a season-low 21 games under .500, their worst record at 
this juncture since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being grateful that the players will continue playing until at 
least Aug. 12, who could blame management for being irritated they didn't 
strike? 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the pennant race from hell, and look at us," Angel General Manager 
Bill Bavasi said. "It's very, very frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps even more painful is that things could get worse, pending the length 
of the strike. If the strike lasts the duration of the season, sources say the 
Angels are projecting losses as $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "A strike will put us very deep in the red," said Angel President Richard 
Brown, declining to be specific. "Just say it will cost us lots and lots of 
money.  
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is bigger than the players. It's bigger than the owners. It's going 
to survive somehow, it's just a matter of how many casualties (the strike) will 
take with them." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the Angels must abide by the Major League Players Assn.'s 
decision, and continue to play games until the strike. They managed to lose 
their latest game when pinch-hitter Eric Anthony hit a pinch-hit two-run homer 
in the eighth inning off closer Mark Leiter, and a 2-1 lead became a 4-2 
defeat.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; ASTROS WIN THIRD IN A ROW OVER ROCKIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Servais and Craig Biggio drove in two runs apiece in Houston as the 
Astros defeated the Colorado Rockies, 6-2, to earn their third consecutive 
victory over their most troublesome foe. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Kile (8-6) gave up eight hits and two runs in 6 2/3 innings as Houston 
won for only the seventh time in 24 games against Colorado. Kile struck out 
five and did not walk a batter. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 7, Montreal 3 -- Bob Tewksbury gave up only five hits and Todd Zeile 
hit a grand slam as St. Louis ended the Expos' six-game winning streak with the 
victory in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss, only the second for the NL East-leading Expos in their last 16 
games, ended the Cardinals' losing streak at four. 
</P>
<P>
 Tewksbury (12-10), 1-3 with a 9.43 earned-run average in his previous four 
starts, retired 10 in a row to start his fourth complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals led, 3-1, entering the ninth, but Mel Rojas issued two walks 
around a single by Tewksbury, and Zeile cleared the bases with his 17th home 
run. It was his third career slam and sixth homer since the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 5, Chicago 1 -- Mark Gardner gave up five hits in 7 2/3 innings and 
Gary Sheffield drove in three runs in Chicago as the Marlins won their third in 
a row over the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner held the Cubs hitless for 4 1/3 innings before Rick Wilkins singled.  
</P>
<P>
 Gardner (4-4) walked one and struck out four. Sheffield hit his 24th homer and 
had a two-run double. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 5, Philadelphia 1 -- Jon Lieber held the Phillies to three hits in 
7 1/3 innings, and Dave Clark drove in two runs, as the Pirates won in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Lieber (6-6) struck out six and walked one before he was relieved by Ravelo 
Manzanillo, who pitched 1 2/3 innings of hitless relief with three strikeouts.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; YANKEES PILE IT ON AGAINST THE TWINS, 9-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bernie Williams had three of New York's season-high eight doubles and Jim 
Abbott got only his third victory since May 30 as the Yankees won their seventh 
consecutive game, 9-2, over the Minnesota Twins in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 The only runs off Abbott (9-7) in his 5 2/3 innings came on a two-run, 
second-inning homer by Kent Hrbek, who earlier in the day announced he will 
retire after the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees tied their season high with 19 hits, including three apiece by 
Williams, Wade Boggs, Luis Polonia and Paul O'Neill, in winning their ninth 
consecutive road game -- their longest streak since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 New York, with the best record in the majors at 68-38, has gone 18-3 since the 
All-Star break and leads Baltimore by 10 games in the AL East. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott, who has slumped with a 5.86 earned-run average in his last 12 starts, 
gave up six hits, walked four and struck out five against the Twins, who are 
12-32 since May 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 5, Oakland 2 -- The Royals defeated the A's in Kansas City and 
matched the major leagues' longest winning streak in two years with their 13th 
consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Felix Jose had three hits and Kevin Appier (7-6), with only one decision in 
his eight previous starts, pitched a four-hitter. The A's lost their sixth in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 5, Detroit 0 -- Rookie Albie Lopez struck out 11 in recording his 
first career shutout, leading the Indians past the Tigers before 41,926, the 
largest crowd ever at Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez (1-1), a 22-year-old right-hander, gave up five hits and had a 
career-high 11 strikeouts in his first complete game in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 4, Chicago 1 -- Brian Bohanon turned in his best start of the season and 
the Rangers stretched their lead to 4 1/2 games in the AL West with the victory 
at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusty Greer hit a two-run homer and Jeff Frye and Juan Gonzalez had RBI 
singles to help the Rangers move within four games of .500. 
</P>
<P>
 Bohanon (2-1) gave up seven hits and struck out five in 6 1/3 innings. Tom 
Henke pitched the ninth for his 15th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 5, Boston 2 -- Paul Molitor scored the go-ahead run from second base 
on a groundout as the Blue Jays defeated the Red Sox at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The bases were loaded with one out in the sixth when John Olerud hit a 
grounder to third baseman Carlos Rodriguez, who bobbled the ball before getting 
a force at second. But the relay to first was too late to double up Olerud, and 
Molitor scored standing up. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Stottlemyre (6-7) gave up two runs on seven hits in seven innings. Joe 
Carter reached 100 RBIs for the sixth season in a row with a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 5, Baltimore 3 -- Jose Valentin hit a two-run homer and John Jaha 
had a pair of RBI doubles as the Brewers snapped a three-game losing streak 
with the victory at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Eldred (11-10) won his second game in a row, giving up seven hits in 6 1/3 
innings.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wide receiver is the Raiders' deepest position, and it might have gotten even 
deeper with the emergence of Daryl Hobbs, a two-year veteran from University of 
Pacific via Santa Monica College and University High. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobbs caught two passes for 35 yards, including a 20-yard touchdown, Sunday in 
the Raiders' exhibition victory over the Denver Broncos at Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Brown, Alexander Wright, James Jett and Rocket Ismail are expected to get 
the bulk of the work during the regular season.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been around here for a while now and it's time for me step up," said 
Hobbs, who spent his first season on the Raiders' developmental squad and was 
used sparingly last season. "It's like going to school and studying the same 
thing for three years. After a while, you know you're good at it." 
</P>
<P>
 With Wright sidelined because of a leg injury, Hobbs has been used as the 
third wide receiver on the starting unit and is expected to get considerable 
playing time Sunday when the Raiders play the Cowboys at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fatigue from their weeklong trip to Spain apparently caught up with the 
Raiders Thursday as the team dragged through a 2 1/2-hour morning practice at 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "A trip like that eventually catches up to you," Coach Art Shell said. "You 
have practices like that when you're not feeling good and you're not 
concentrating on what has to be done. You just have to push your way through." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sunday's game is an exhibition, Shell said he wants the Raiders to 
take it seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't try to put a leash on them," Shell said. "I want them to play 
aggressively -- (the Cowboys) are the world champions." LONNIE WHITE

 Defensive end Fred Stokes, a key to the pass rush, has been hard at work 
rehabilitating his left knee. Stokes, who strained a ligament Friday, began 
stretching on Sunday and worked out on a stationary bicycle and in the swimming 
pool this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes, expected to be out three weeks, wouldn't commit himself to a return 
date. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doctors and trainers look at a situation and set a certain period of time," 
Stokes said. "If they say a guy is going to be out three weeks and he comes 
back in two, then he's ahead of schedule. But maybe that wasn't his schedule in 
the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any problems with being ready for the first game. But I try to 
keep out of my mind thoughts about being back out there and running again." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes is over one hump already with the help of an old friend and former 
teammate. Former Washington Redskin Charles Mann called him Sunday to offer 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charles has had knee problems since he was 16," Stokes said. "Charles is a 
detail guy. He started talking about fibers and stuff. I didn't know what he 
was talking about. But the best thing he told me was not to expect too much, 
too quick. If you expect too much, you'll let yourself down. I was a little 
down and he gave me some confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Mann found out about the injury from his mother, according to Stokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was going somewhere with his mom and she said, 'Did you hear? Fred Stokes 
hurt his knee and is out for the season,' " Stokes said. "He picked up his car 
phone right then and called. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a little worried after that and called my mom to tell her I was OK. If 
Charles heard that I was out for the year, by the time my mom heard about it, 
the story would be that my leg was amputated."

 The Rams will take 71 players to Madison. Players who will not make the trip 
are defensive tackle Marc Boutte (knee), defensive back Dexter Davis (ankle), 
defensive back Clifford Hicks (Achilles tendon), defensive back Steve Israel 
(quadriceps), wide receiver Sean LaChapelle (ankle), defensive end Kevin 
Patrick (shoulder), defensive end Robert Young (groin) and Stokes. Defensive 
back Darryl Henley, who was signed by the team Wednesday, also will remain in 
California. . . . The Rams released offensive tackle Justin Starck to make room 
for Henley on their 80-man roster. CHRIS FOSTER

 Rapper Eazy-E (Eric Wright) has taken on a new and rather tame venture, by his 
usual standards: hosting a weekly , party-style radio show on KKBT-FM ("The 
Beat," 92.3)  
</P>
<P>
 Wright, who founded the rap group N.W.A., first drew controversy for writing a 
song that many believed advocated violence against police officers, and then 
later for championing the cause of LAPD Officer Theodore Briseno, who was 
charged with beating Rodney G. King. On "The Ruthless Radio Show" (named after 
Wright's Ruthless Records company), the rapper and his friends -- Julio G., 
Tony G. and Jesse Collins -- take a non-controversial approach as they spin 
tunes, take requests or "shout-outs" from listeners and interview visiting 
artists.  
</P>
<P>
 Wright talked about his show (airing Saturdays from 6-9 p.m.), efforts to 
censor rap and the pressure rappers feel to live up to their gangsta image.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What made you decide to do this radio show? Whose idea was it? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It was all of our ideas. I don't want to take the credit. What I 
really wanted to do was get a pirate radio station and cut into all of the 
major stations out here and just play our show on all the stations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kind of show are we going to hear over the weeks to come?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's just a spontaneous kind of show. The show is never going to be the 
same every week. It's three hours of open radio. You never know who will be 
stopping by. I might do a little (performing).  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I hear you're working on a double album with all the unexpurgated lyrics 
from rap songs. What do you think about the recent effort by community 
organizations who have pressured radio stations to drop offensive words from 
rap music? Is it a form of censorship?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think it's kind of cool. I can understand why they're doing it. I guess 
it is censorship, but to get airplay you have to take some of those words out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about all the rappers who are charged with crimes these days? Why do 
so many seem to be getting into trouble when they've attained success, and life 
should be smooth sailing? 
</P>
<P>
 A: A lot of people try to live up to their image when they're really not like 
that. There's a lot of pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do all the arrests do to the image of rap? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It gets blurred up even more. But, it's good for record sales. To be on the 
cover of Time magazine and all that, that's good for record sales. . . . If you 
can sell 4 million records off shooting somebody, I'd say you can beat that 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about people who say rap music contributes to the violence in our 
society? Do you feel like you're part of that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, I don't think I'm a part of it. Violence has been here since the 
beginning of time. I think it's all the drugs on the streets and everything 
else that makes everybody violent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you feel the image of gangsta rap affects kids?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Who gave it that title, gangsta rap? It's reality rap. It's about what's 
really going on. I get asked that question a lot. It does affect some kids. But 
other kids know right from wrong. Or they should know right from wrong. And 
that goes back to home, the parents.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You are a former gangster and drug dealer. What advice do you give to kids 
who are gangbangers or are contemplating getting into a gang?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I talk to a lot of kids. I tell them, 'Stay away from all this stuff. Be a 
rapper.' (He laughs.) I do a lot of that. I go to correctional facilities and 
talk to kids there. They have little kids in there who are like 12 years old 
stealing cars and stuff like that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why does the negative aspect of rap get so much attention, as opposed to 
more positive images of African Americans?  
</P>
<P>
 A: You know why it's gotten that attention? Because it's started going to 
different neighborhoods: Beverly Hills and here and there. And when it starts 
getting there that's when there's a problem. As long as it stayed in the 'hood, 
it was no problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: A few years ago you paid $2,490 to have dinner with President Bush. You 
were invited by Sen. Bob Dole to a Republican Inner Circle event where Bush was 
going to speak. Why did you do that? And what was it like?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I was on a list of just giving donations. I give to Athletes and 
Entertainers for Kids and Make a Wish Foundation so (the Republican Party) 
pulled my name off the list and they sent me an invitation. I went down there 
to see what was going on. It was a trip. CBS was there and all kinds of media. 
I had a bunch of different interviews and I came back home. I saw it on the 
news and they said, "How can this guy go to something like this?" And they 
showed me at home where I have this nice gun collection. . . . It wasn't a lot 
of money. How much press did I get? I tell you it paid off. I would have paid 
$100,000 for that press.

HOLLYWOOD HABITS; LEAVE 'WYATT EARP' OFF HIS TOMBSTONE; MOVIES: SCRIPTER DAN 
GORDON WANTS CRITICS TO KNOW THAT THE FILM IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HE AND KEVIN 
COSTNER WROTE AND FROM HIS BOOK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hollywood writers are paid a lot to relinquish control. But that doesn't 
eradicate the pain. Even the most thick-skinned watch in frustration as their 
vision takes unanticipated turns. 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the case with "Wyatt Earp," according to a letter that writer Dan 
Gordon dashed off to critics lambasting the screenplay. The three-hour-plus 
film, rewritten by director Lawrence Kasdan, had opened to downbeat reviews and 
equally discouraging audience response. While he didn't want to disparage 
Kasdan, Gordon stressed, neither did he want his "Murder in the First" -- a 
courtroom drama to be released by Warner Bros. in the fall -- to be tainted by 
any "residual aftertaste." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Gordon, a veteran screenwriter responsible for such films as the 
1992 hit "Passenger 57," the final version of the script was a far cry from the 
one he and "Wyatt Earp" star/co-producer Kevin Costner had knocked out over 
nearly three years. To illustrate his point, Gordon sent along a copy of his 
novelization and a book-on-tape he narrated himself -- both based on his 
version of the story. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin and I were visualizing a 'Western Godfather,' " recalls Gordon, whose 
involvement with the project ended when Kasdan came on board in early 1993. "It 
was to be two movies, in fact, centering on three families: the Earps and two 
organized crime families. Mike Gray, a bizarro mirror image of Earp, managed to 
get Tombstone, the richest town west of the Mississippi, deeded to his private 
company. It was a land grab worth $10 million to $20 million in 1880 dollars -- 
and the only thing between him and that money was Wyatt Earp. That's what our 
story was about." 
</P>
<P>
 Costner's mandate, Gordon recalls, was to ensure that every part in the 
picture was so strong that he had difficulty deciding which one to play. The 
rewrite, he maintains, not only eliminated the villains but tacked on a 
lengthy, superfluous opening sequence, diluted the love story and substituted 
an inconclusive flashback for the more satisfying original ending. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our version put the whole story into the realm of classic tragedy," says 
Gordon. "Earp realized that he had become that which he was fighting against. 
And there's no sign of China Mary, who served as the Greek chorus of the piece, 
or the whole Tombstone Chinese community." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon believes that the movie he and Costner visualized would have more 
easily differentiated itself from the similar "Tombstone," a December, 1993, 
release that some believe negatively affected the Kasdan film's box office. 
("Instead of offering the same film with a different cast, we would have had a 
different film with a different cast," he says.) 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he remains philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm gratified that my original vision is preserved in the book and the 
book-on-tape," Gordon asserts. "The director's vision of my screenplay is on 
film. I'll stand by mine, and I'll let him stand by his." 
</P>
<P>
 Kasdan, who is in Paris preparing the romantic comedy "Paris Match" starring 
Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline, declined to comment -- as did Costner, who is in 
Hawaii shooting "Waterworld," a futuristic action-adventure movie for Universal 
Pictures.

KABC, KTLA NEWSCASTS STILL ON TOP IN SOUTHLAND; TELEVISION: BUT COMPETITORS ARE 
NIPPING AT THEIR HEELS. ANN MARTIN'S JUMP TO KCBS SEEMS TO HAVE HAD A POSITIVE 
IMPACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 With the O.J. Simpson case capturing the bulk of the air time, the ratings 
battles among local TV newscasts held true to form during the July sweeps: 
KABC-TV Channel 7 and KTLA-TV Channel 5 remain the most-watched newscasts in 
the area, although neither enjoys a lot of breathing space, according to 
viewing statistics released Thursday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Riding the advantage of its "Oprah Winfrey" lead-in, KABC again swept the 
three afternoon time periods over second-place KNBC-TV Channel 4. But the two 
tied at 11 p.m., where KABC had won a year ago by about 50,000 homes, when Ann 
Martin was still co-anchoring for Channel 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Martin is at KCBS-TV Channel 2, and while the CBS-owned station still came 
in third in all news races, she seems to have had a positive impact. Channel 
2's 11 p.m. newscast scored a 35% increase over July, 1993, though Martin and 
co-anchor Michael Tuck still trail KABC and KNBC by about 150,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin's 5 p.m. newscast also showed a slight increase, but KCBS must cut a 
200,000 home gap before it will be competitive in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the independent stations, KTLA continued its longtime dominance in news 
at 10 p.m., holding steady compared to the previous July and even improving on 
its numbers of the May sweeps, when overall television viewing is much higher 
than in the summer. By contrast, most other newscasts lost viewers compared to 
their May totals. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox-owned KTTV-TV Channel 11 saw its deficit at 10 p.m. increase over what it 
was two months ago, but the station's news numbers nonetheless skyrocketed 33% 
over those of a year ago. The station now trails Channel 5 by about 55,000 
homes, shaving by half its rival's commanding lead of a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In the morning, KNBC won the 6 a.m. news hour over KABC by a scant 5,000 
homes. KTLA was third, KTTV was fourth and KCBS, which lost half of its 
audience from last summer, finished fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 KTLA, despite dropping 18% of its audience of July 1993, again dominated the 
7-9 a.m. breakfast slot, trouncing all three network morning programs, all of 
which experienced audience defections too. KTTV finished last with its year-old 
morning program, but its ratings did increase 66% over its anemic debut last 
year. Still, KTTV's two-hour program grabs just 6% of the audience watching 
television at that time, while 17% of those viewers choose KTLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The July sweeps is one of four annual ratings periods that help local stations 
determine some advertising rates. These results reflect total households 
watching television, but station executives caution that in terms of 
determining actual advertising revenue, more specific demographic ratings -- 
such as the totals among adults ages 18 to 49 -- are far more important.

LETTERS TO DUNAWAY STIR 'SUNSET' CONTROVERSY; THEATER: A MISSIVE FROM ANDREW 
LLOYD WEBBER DETAILS THE ACTRESS'S FIRING, WHILE THE SHOW'S DIRECTOR SAYS HE 
ARGUED AGAINST CLOSING THE L.A. SHOW. 
</P>

<P>
 The offstage saga of "Sunset Boulevard" continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Separate letters to actress Faye Dunaway from the show's director and its 
producer are generating controversy, speculation and possible lawsuit fodder 
regarding Dunaway's abrupt firing and the show's closing in Los Angeles on June 
26. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Lloyd Webber, the show's composer and producer, and "Sunset" director 
Trevor Nunn have each written Dunaway detailing what led up to the two events. 
And given that Dunaway has threatened legal action on her firing, the letters 
are of more than passing interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Settlement talks are now under way between lawyers for Dunaway and Lloyd 
Webber, says Dunaway's lawyer, Pierce O' Donnell. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell, the man who got a $900,000 judgment in 1992 for Art Buchwald and 
his producing partner in their breach-of-contract suit against Paramount 
Pictures, calls Nunn's missive to Dunaway "a multimillion-dollar letter."  
</P>
<P>
 While he refused to discuss its contents, O'Donnell confirmed he has in hand a 
three-page, single-spaced letter from Nunn to Dunaway. The letter was sent 
about a week after Dunaway learned she'd been fired.  
</P>
<P>
 According to sources, Nunn's letter details what led to the decision to close 
the show in Los Angeles and expresses his disagreement with that decision. It 
also reportedly apologizes for how Dunaway was handled.  
</P>
<P>
 Nunn, who also directed Lloyd Webber's "Cats," "Aspects of Love" and 
"Starlight Express," wrote London's Evening Standard a few days after writing 
Dunaway. That letter followed an article in the British newspaper in which 
Lloyd Webber said, among other things, that "the decision to close in L.A. was 
forced on us by the director, Trevor Nunn, and the musical director, David 
Caddick -- both of whom felt that Faye was not ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Nunn's letter to the Evening Standard refutes that. "I protested forcibly for 
several days that the decision to close the show should be reversed," Nunn 
wrote. "I was not present at the meeting at which Andrew describes himself as 
arguing for a postponement. If I had been, then he and I would certainly have 
been on the same side." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dunaway, who had no stage experience as a singer, was hired in May by Lloyd 
Webber. On June 23, just a few weeks before Dunaway was expected to open in the 
show, Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Company released a statement saying "it was 
concluded after several weeks of rehearsals and vocal preparation that the 
musical demands of the role were such that it was not possible for (Dunaway) to 
perform as scheduled." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunaway learned of this through her then-manager, Bob Palmer, who said the 
Oscar-winning actress was "flabbergasted." One day after the announcement, 
Dunaway hosted a press conference at which she called the composer's decision 
"yet another capricious act by a capricious man." 
</P>
<P>
 The Evening Standard also printed a long letter sent from Lloyd Webber to 
Dunaway a few weeks later. In that letter, which O'Donnell confirms is the same 
letter Dunaway received, Lloyd Webber told the actress that his decision to 
fire her "was certainly not 'capricious.' It was a very carefully considered 
decision, taken after much debate and with great concern for your career and 
reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony-winning actress Patti LuPone also found herself out of a promised job as 
"Sunset's" Norma Desmond. LuPone, who originated that role in London in July, 
1993, was originally contracted to reprise it on Broadway this fall. After 
repeated denials, Lloyd Webber announced in February that Glenn Close would 
play the role on Broadway, and in mid-May, Really Useful and LuPone's attorney 
said they had reached a settlement of reportedly more than $1 million.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sunset Boulevard" is still playing in London. The $13-million Broadway 
production, starring Close and to be directed by Nunn, is scheduled to open 
Nov. 17. According to the Really Useful Company, the Broadway production 
already has passed $20 million in advance ticket sales, considerably more than 
the $4 million in advance ticket sales the Los Angeles production had when it 
closed at Century City's Shubert Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, producer Garth Drabinsky has announced plans to produce "Sunset 
Boulevard" in November, 1995, at Toronto's North York Performing Arts Centre. 
Really Useful has said the Toronto production will use such elements from the 
Los Angeles production as its $3.5-million to $4-million set. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Webber's attorney, New York-based John Eastman, did not return Times' 
calls. But lawyer O'Donnell said he has sent Eastman's office a 38-page 
complaint and a copy of Nunn's letter.  
</P>
<P>
 "Both sides have a preference to solve it out of court, if we can, but Faye 
Dunaway's resolve to get justice is unwavering," O'Donnell said. "We are ready 
to file (our complaint) in a heartbeat if settlement talks break down. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very determined person. She can and will sing if necessary."

Q&A; 'I'M IN WHAT YOU COULD CALL A REGROUPING STAGE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT EPSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For an actress who claims to be "regrouping," Lindsay Wagner has her daily 
planner in overload.  
</P>
<P>
 She's host of tonight's "Best Sellers: Men Who Hate Women and the Women Who 
Love Them," a two-hour magazine-type show on NBC based on the nonfiction book 
by therapist Susan Forward.  
</P>
<P>
 She starts two back-to-back television movies Aug. 15, one a sequel to her 
late-1970s series "The Bionic Woman," the other about a woman searching for a 
teen - age daughter turned prostitute.  
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the flip, hip Wagner as seen in her commercials for Ford dealers 
in Southern California and, more recently, in Vancouver, British Columbia.  
</P>
<P>
 She still has her causes: rebuilding programs in South-Central Los Angeles, 
vegetarianism, TV violence. But, she insists, she's regrouping, spending a lot 
more time with her two sons, 8 and 12, cutting down some of her activities, 
planning what comes next. * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Are you stuck with the image of being "The Bionic Woman"? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I don't think something like that ever goes away, but it's not 
anything that has hindered me. If it did, I wouldn't go near it again. I have 
such a body of work since that series that people definitely relate to all the 
television movies I've made since then. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Could "Bionic Breakdown" (the new movie) lead to another series?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No. I don't want to do that. I started out in this business in feature 
films. "Bionic" just dropped in my lap. I didn't want a TV series. As it turned 
out, it was rather karmic, you know; it wouldn't go away. The series was just 
what it was, and I learned a lot about the business. I came out of it with a 
lot of exposure enabling me to go into things I wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Like feature movies? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. Features in the '80s were in a stage of Rambos and Rambettes -- beat 
her up, rape her, kill her. You want out of the kitchen? Fine, we'll just 
terrorize you then. That's where we were. I stayed in television because that 
was where I could work and do the type of movies I wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you look for in your movies? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I pay far more attention to what the reverberations of the movie will be in 
the audience rather than looking for a good role for myself.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you mean by "reverberations"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You can expose ideas in a film that will be helpful to viewers while being 
entertaining. I tend to look for projects that have some meaning and value so 
that people will be left with something that might enrich their lives in some 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You have many involvements away from acting. Have you ever made a movie 
that addresses your concerns about these issues? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I've been able to juggle my time so that while I work a lot I still can 
spend a lot of time with my kids. If I start producing what I would like to do, 
it would take my time totally. Now that my children are starting to have their 
own lives I may have time freed up a little bit more. 
</P>
<P>
 I zip in and zip out of things, sometimes lecturing on holistic health, but 
I'm in what you could call a regrouping stage. I've pulled back. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you mean by regrouping? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It means that I'm not out there putting out a lot of me right now. I worked 
a great deal during the periods of civil unrest in L.A., spending a lot of time 
in South-Central, and I still work with a group that's helped start up 
businesses there and some projects with the National Council of Negro Women. I 
don't question a lot of things that go on inside me. I just do them. I feel I'm 
getting ready to start using my creativity back in my business again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've been critical of television violence. Do you see any good in the 
medium? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The best thing about television is its potential and that at times it's 
willing to do meaningful pieces. A certain amount gets through each year.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What bothers you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I find it ironic that there's a children's show where heroes are set up to 
spend their whole time physically fighting the bad guy and that's how they 
solve problems. Then, at the end of the show, a two-minute skit tells children 
not to fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Children should see how to resolve a problem. You just don't tell them to work 
it out. You show them how someone works through a problem and how violence can 
be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've been doing the Ford commercials in Southern California for the past 
seven years. Have they affected your career? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If they have, it wasn't part of my thinking. I was a little nervous about 
that since there are a lot of prejudices in our business. Theater people look 
down on film people, film people look down on television people and everybody 
looks down at commercial people. 
</P>
<P>
 We're all actors. My goal with the commercials was to make each one a little 
movie about the car, and I play whatever character is appropriate. Sometimes I 
play a ditzy blonde in the back of the truck with my hair all frizzed out and a 
sweater slung over my shoulder, and other times I'm a housewife looking for the 
most economical car. A lot of it is ad-libbed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have you done comedy? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That's what the commercials have done for my career. People say, "You know, 
you're really funny." I say, "No kidding." 
</P>
<P>
 *

ACTOR CRAMS FOR TEST; ENVIRONMENT: ED BEGLEY JR. SAID A WEEK'S WORTH OF HIS 
DISCARDS WOULD FIT IN A GLOVE COMPARTMENT. CAN HE MAKE GOOD ON HIS BOAST, OR 
WAS HE JUST TALKING TRASH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just the day before, environmentally vigilant actor Ed Begley Jr. had stood 
before the five Los Angeles County supervisors, arguing that there would be no 
need for more landfills if everyone followed his example and discarded only 
enough trash each week to fill a glove compartment. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, to prove that it was no idle boast, Begley was straining to cram a 
week's worth of household trash into the tiny glove compartment of his 
battery-powered Volkswagen Rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has got to be the smallest goddamn glove box in the history of man," 
said Begley, an environmental activist best known for his role as a doctor on 
the television series "St. Elsewhere." "This is the one time I wish I owned a 
Buick Le Sabre." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Begley had ridden his bicycle 13 miles from Studio City to 
Downtown to argue against the Sunshine Canyon landfill north of Granada Hills 
and in support of recycling.  
</P>
<P>
 "I throw away one glove compartment's worth of trash every week," Begley 
boasted. "I know it's doable." 
</P>
<P>
 Sniffed Supervisor Ed Edelman's spokesman: "Dramatic hyperbole."  
</P>
<P>
 Was Begley's boast fiction or fact? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Times went to his Studio City home Wednesday to throw down the gauntlet. 
Given scant warning of the visit, Begley swore he had not squirreled away any 
trash to reduce the load. But he had taken the time to slip into a Greenpeace 
web belt, white T-shirt and jeans, laundered, of course, with nonphosphate 
detergent, one of the many environmentally correct products he stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all begins right here," said Begley, pointing to three cardboard cartons 
resting on his wood floor underneath a desk. He sorts every scrap of paper that 
passes through the door of the one-story, solar-powered ranch house with its 
drought-resistant front lawn, where he lives alone except for frequent visits 
from his two teen-age children and his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce the flow of junk mail, he calls every company that sends him a 
catalogue and asks to be taken off the mailing list. About once a month, Begley 
hops into his $12,000 electric car and drives over to a Sun Valley recycler to 
sell the boxes of colored paper, white paper and uncorrugated cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Charging into his kitchen, reporter in pursuit, Begley picks over his kitchen 
trash before emptying it into a larger white bag (made of recycled plastic, 
naturally): a plastic oatmeal cookie wrapper, an empty bag of brown rice. No 
problem there. But, Begley scowls, what are these objects taking up so much 
room? 
</P>
<P>
 "My girlfriend was over. I'm not responsible for this milk carton," Begley 
said. "And my kids had some cream cheese that went bad, that's why this thing 
is here." 
</P>
<P>
 Conspicuously absent from Begley's trash cans are the frozen food packages 
with their microwaveable trays that many harried Angelenos rely on for 
sustenance -- which cannot be recycled. "I have a microwave," Begley said, "but 
the most I use it for is maybe to heat up a tofu dog. I grow most of my own 
food." 
</P>
<P>
 Then it's out toward the garden, with a quick peek at the yellow bin provided 
by the city for aluminum cans, glass bottles and other recyclable materials. 
"God smiled at me . . . by making me part of one of the city's first recycling 
pilot programs," Begley said, caressing the yellow plastic bin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Begley's real pride and joy is a brown mound of decaying yard trimmings 
and tomato skins lying just outside his back door. His compost heap produces 
enough soil to replenish the beds of corn, beets and tomatoes that take up 
almost every square inch of his spacious back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, Begley has collected enough trash to fill the white plastic bag to a 
depth of about seven bulging inches. He hurries through the garden to the 
garage, where his taupe electric car is recharging with its hood up, on the way 
compulsively squeezing the bag to condense the load. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting down in the passenger seat, Begley pops open the glove compartment, 
which is the size of a small breadbox. He takes a deep breath and, using both 
hands, tries to cram the bag in. It doesn't fit. 
</P>
<P>
 But the indefatigable actor has one more trick up his sleeve. Well, actually, 
up his pants. Propping his legs up on the glove compartment, Begley shoves with 
the force of leg muscles that have bicycled countless times over the Sepulveda 
Pass. The bottom of the glove box actually bulges as the bursting bag squeezes 
in centimeter by centimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It fits!" Begley shouts triumphantly, slamming shut the glove box before the 
garbage can escape. "I didn't really know if I could do it."

GRAND JURY PROBES COMPTON POLICE BEATING; REACTION: CHIEF HOURIE TAYLOR SAYS HE 
WAS SHOCKED BY THE TAPE, BUT DEFENDS THE DEPARTMENT AND SAYS HE HAS BEEN 
'TRYING TO SENSITIZE OUR OFFICERS TO THE COMMUNITY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first time Compton Police Chief Hourie Taylor saw the televised videotape 
of one of his officers beating a teen-ager with a police baton, he was shocked, 
Taylor said Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised, certainly. I was shocked," Taylor said. "I'm not saying his 
actions were incorrect . . . but I wasn't expecting it." 
</P>
<P>
 The tape, showing Officer Michael Jackson hitting 17-year-old Felipe Soltero 
as he lay on the ground, was especially disconcerting for Taylor, who has spent 
the last two years trying to instill a new attitude in his 125 officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the videotaped beating of Rodney G. King by Los Angeles police 
officers and the riots the next year, Taylor has been putting out the word that 
brutal force is not acceptable in Compton, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're still a quasi-military organization, like all police departments. But 
we're moving toward community-based policing and trying to sensitize our 
officers to the community and the ethnic diversity within it," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 He became acting police chief just days before the riots began -- after about 
23 years on the Compton force -- and was given the job permanently in January, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 As chief, Taylor said, he has fired three officers: one for using excessive 
force and two for improper conduct. Two other officers left the department 
before they could be fired or punished for misconduct, but he would not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "On occasion we do have people who violate procedures and we react to that as 
quickly as possible," Taylor said.  
</P>
<P>
 In describing his department's record of discipline and citizen complaints, 
Taylor is quick to point out that his officers labor under a heavy workload. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, when 29 citizen complaints were recorded -- seven of them alleging 
excessive force -- his officers also handled 160,000 calls for service, Taylor 
said. In 1992, when seven of 25 citizen complaints involved excessive use of 
force, the number of calls was similar, he said. This year, 14 complaints have 
been logged, but Taylor did not know how many of those alleged excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you'll find that the ratio of complaints to radio calls is something 
like one-tenth of 1%," Taylor said. "That's a good record." 
</P>
<P>
 But some in the community are complaining that Taylor's record isn't good 
enough and that he should resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton attorney John Ortega said he filed a complaint of excessive force last 
November on behalf of two Latino youths and never heard from the department 
again -- even after the complaint was apparently found to be without merit, he 
said. Compton police have declined to provide specifics about any excessive 
force complaints.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Taylor) has done a little bit to change," but the change has not 
been fast enough and Taylor should resign, Ortega said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, however, says that change is already happening. And for an 
understaffed department with fewer financial resources than a big city, his 
officers do "a magnificent job," Taylor said.  
</P>
<P>
 Those who don't are quickly disciplined, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Discipline is common in an officer's career, even his own, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like Jackson, who was punished with a one-day suspension in 1991 for an 
off-duty incident, Taylor said he was also suspended for a day in the early 
1970s when he was a Compton patrolman. Although Taylor refused to elaborate on 
the incident for which Jackson was suspended, he did reveal the cause of his 
own suspension: having an on-duty collision in a patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to go through a career without some kind of discipline," Taylor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have tried to create a mind-set that we are going to be professional in our 
work, or the officer will face discipline," Taylor said. "I hope that message 
is out there with all my officers."

GRAND JURY PROBES COMPTON POLICE BEATING; INVESTIGATION: ACTIVISTS CALL FOR 
OFFICER TO BE CHARGED IN THE CONFRONTATION WITH A TEEN-AGER AND URGE POLICE 
CHIEF TO RESIGN. THE YOUTH'S LAWYER IS ORDERED TO TURN OVER VIDEOTAPE OF 
INCIDENT.

<P>
 With the Los Angeles County grand jury moving quickly to look into the 
videotaped beating of a teen-ager by a Compton police officer, community 
activists Thursday called for charges to be filed against the officer and 
demanded that the city's police chief resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Humberto Guizar, who represents 17-year-old Felipe Soltero, was subpoenaed by 
the grand jury and ordered to turn over the crucial videotape that shows 
Officer Michael Jackson lunging at the youth and then striking him at least six 
times with his baton. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's Special Investigations Division is looking into the 
beating, but because no charges have been filed, it cannot subpoena witnesses 
or evidence. The grand jury, however, can order evidence produced. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson was called last Friday by a county children's social worker to the 
mobile home where Soltero lives with his mother, his mother's companion, Manuel 
Shigala, and five other children. The social worker had gone to the residence 
to investigate an allegation of child abuse involving Shigala, 41, and she 
alleged that Soltero had interfered with her and threatened her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's report on the incident said he had to subdue Soltero with his baton 
after the 130-pound youth hit him with his fist while being arrested. Jackson's 
attorney said Thursday that the police officer, who is short of stature but 
weighs more than 180 pounds, wrestled with Soltero before the confrontation 
seen on the tape. 
</P>
<P>
 With the tape's images shown repeatedly on local and national television for a 
third day, angry anti-police rhetoric was accompanied by church-sponsored peace 
rallies and calls for calm. 
</P>
<P>
 "They treat us like animals, and it's time for it to stop," said Theresa 
Allison, founder of the Mothers Reclaiming Our Children organization in Los 
Angeles, one of the groups that was scheduled to participate in a protest march 
Thursday night outside Compton police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that although Jackson is African American and Soltero is Latino, the 
issue is police abuse, not racism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's not make it like a black and Latino thing," she said. "It's human 
beings being beat up, human beings being discriminated against." 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 whites, Latinos and African Americans demonstrated in front of the 
Compton police station for about 30 minutes Thursday evening, chanting "No 
justice! No peace!" The group demanded that a civilian review board investigate 
charges of police misconduct and that charges be filed against Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not about color," said Antoine Brown, one of the demonstrators. "It's 
about the badge." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pedro Pallan, a Compton baker and past president of the city's Latino 
Chamber of Commerce, said the video "proves what we've been saying all along -- 
the Compton police have a hostile attitude toward Latinos." 
</P>
<P>
 Pallan and other Latino leaders in Compton said Compton Police Chief Hourie 
Taylor should be forced to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 The videotape comes at a time when racial animosity and competition for jobs 
and services in Compton is growing, said Robert Almanzan, a spokesman for the 
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. In fact, MALDEF and the 
Compton chapter of the NAACP organized a summit meeting of 300 African American 
and Latino community leaders in April to come up with ways to reduce those 
tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said: "We really need to see this incident for what it's worth and . . 
. get more information before things get heated up more than they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Michael Hannon, who represents Jackson, called attempts to paint his 
client as a racist "a complete fabrication," and said that the videotape shows 
only a fraction of what went on between Soltero and his client. 
</P>
<P>
 Hannon and witnesses at the Westland trailer park said that the two wrestled 
briefly until Soltero's 14-year-old sister tried to stop them. Distracted by 
the girl, Jackson let Soltero up and the youth put up his fists. That is when 
Jackson used his baton to knock Soltero down, Hannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson is "feeling pretty abused, generally, because the news is pillorying 
him based on about 25% of the story," Hannon said. He refused a request for an 
interview with Jackson, who has been placed on paid administrative leave by the 
Compton Police Department after the videotape was broadcast on KNBC-TV Channel 
4. 
</P>
<P>
 Guizar rejected Hannon's version of events. During a brief interview with 
reporters at his attorney's office, Soltero said in Spanish that he did not 
wrestle with Jackson but that the officer knocked him to the ground as he was 
being arrested. When he stood up, the officer hit him in the face with the back 
end of the baton, Soltero said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Guizar, his client later asked Jackson why he had not handcuffed 
Soltero when Soltero was down the first time. Jackson's answer, Guizar said, 
was that he "wanted to have some fun that day." 
</P>
<P>
 Soltero was examined Thursday by Encino neurologist Dr. Martin Levine. 
According to Guizar, Levine determined that Soltero has a concussion, a 
forehead bruise and an injured left elbow, which is causing partial numbness in 
his hand. On the tape Jackson is seen dragging Soltero to his patrol car by his 
elbow, using his baton as a hoist. 
</P>
<P>
 Guizar said Soltero also is experiencing headaches, impaired vision and 
difficulty sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the battle over ownership of the tape continued. KNBC, which 
broadcast the tape for the first time Tuesday, has said it purchased exclusive 
rights to its use for $125 from Soltero's godmother. Citing those rights, the 
station has refused to allow other stations to broadcast it. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, however, an attorney stepped forward to say that the tape was 
actually shot by a neighbor and that Soltero's family did not have the right to 
sell it to a television station. Jim Blancarte, a lawyer who represents Libidia 
Vasquez, said his client sold the tape to Soltero's mother for $60 with the 
understanding that she would only show it to police to get her son released 
from jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Hoffman, KNBC's vice president for news, released a statement Thursday 
night saying that the station had discussed the tape with Vasquez before 
purchasing it from Maria Quintana, Soltero's godmother. With Quintana's 
ownership of the tape now under attack, Hoffman said the station will 
investigate the issue further.

CISNEROS, RIORDAN TOUR 'GHOST TOWNS'; EARTHQUAKE: U.S. HOUSING SECRETARY 
HIGHLIGHTS FEDERAL STRATEGY TO HELP REPAIR DAMAGED APARTMENT BUILDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros and Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan 
toured San Fernando Valley "ghost towns" Thursday, drawing attention to a new 
strategy to jump-start repair work in apartment neighborhoods with heavy 
earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidestepping rubble and ducking under the roof of a partly collapsed garage, 
the two leaders met the owners of two Granada Hills apartment complexes, which 
city officials say might never be rebuilt without funds that the Administration 
hopes to shift from other earthquake programs into housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ghost towns" are concentrations of uninhabited apartment buildings condemned 
for quake damage that attract squatters and become centers for drug use, gang 
gatherings and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to an appeal by Riordan, President Clinton earlier this month 
asked Congress to redistribute $225 million from highway and school 
retrofitting projects to the city governments of Los Angeles and Santa Monica, 
to be lent to owners of damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds would go into 30-year, no-interest loans with no payments due for 
the first six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the reallocation has yet to receive congressional approval, Cisneros 
said he is confident that "Congress is on board," and that the money will start 
to reach local officials in a matter of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan, accompanied by northeast Valley Councilman Richard Alarcon, responded 
by praising the Clinton Administration for its quick response to his request, 
made about a week ago, for the extra housing funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, Cisneros said the Riordan Administration's deft handling of 
earthquake relief gave him great confidence in entrusting the money to the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejecting criticism that the money will be taken from other urgent projects, 
Cisneros said it is needed to address a crisis that could leave the city with 
permanent blight. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see that this is uninhabitable, unacceptable for the long run," 
Cisneros said, standing before the eerie facade of a broken 69-unit building on 
Kingsbury Street that leans in all directions, exactly as it did the day after 
the Jan. 17 Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just put yourself in the shoes of an apartment owner who had tenants who are 
gone after the damage," Cisneros said. "They can no longer make bank payments 
and have no choice without help but to walk away. The loser when an apartment 
owner walks away from an apartment like this is the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles housing officials have identified 13 "ghost towns," either 
individual blocks of apartment buildings and condominiums or whole 
neighborhoods that have become virtually uninhabited because so many buildings 
suffered extensive damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are concerned that these areas will attract crime and squatters and 
remain blighted for years to come if the owners of the buildings do not receive 
adequate assistance to rebuild. Because the owners' equity in some of the 
buildings is small, they may not qualify for Small Business Administration 
loans. In other cases, the damage far exceeds the SBA's limit of $1.5 million 
per building. 
</P>
<P>
 The new money -- $200 million to Los Angeles and $25 million to Santa Monica 
-- will help rebuild about 17,000 units, "about half the number unable to get 
the necessary funds," Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 No-interest loans would be used to supplement other sources of capital, Los 
Angeles city housing consultant Rich Wallach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, during a meeting with the Los Angeles Times editorial 
board, Cisneros said he believes that more attention should to be paid to 
future earthquake preparedness to minimize the loss of life. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was moved by a visit to a schoolroom where light fixtures fell on 
desks and shards of broken glass were embedded in chairs, a scene that 
illustrated the potential loss of life if a future earthquake occurs on a 
school day. 
</P>
<P>
 But there aren't enough resources to protect every structure from the great 
potential power of future quakes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, Cisneros said he wants the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development to take the lead in evaluating all aspects of earthquake 
preparedness -- from local ordinances to the federal budget -- to give the 
highest priority to measures that will save lives.

EX-SUBWAY INSPECTOR WINS $1.38 MILLION; COURT: MAN WHO BLEW WHISTLE ON RED LINE 
FLAWS SAID PARSONS DILLINGHAM PREVENTED HIM FROM GETTING ANOTHER JOB. FIRM HAS 
DENIED THE CHARGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A former Metro Rail tunnel quality control inspector, who blew the whistle on 
construction flaws and later triggered an FBI investigation, has been awarded 
$1.38 million by a Superior Court jury in a lawsuit against his former 
employer. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Pate, an inspector with more than 35 years experience in heavy 
construction and mining, sued Parsons Dillingham Construction Management, 
alleging that his supervisor prevented him from getting another job after he 
was laid off from the firm overseeing work on the Red Line subway. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pasadena jury awarded Pate $460,000 for loss of wages this week. Under the 
labor code, that amount is tripled, bringing the total to $1.38 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "They blackballed me and I think we proved that," said Pate, 64. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Morallo, a spokesman for Parsons Dillingham, declined to discuss the 
case. But he said in a prepared statement: "We strongly believe that the labor 
code . . . was not violated and that the verdict against Parsons Dillingham was 
not supported by the facts and the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Morallo said Parsons Dillingham attorneys plan to move for a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Pate's suit had alleged several other causes of action, including wrongful 
discharge and age discrimination. But those were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Parsons Dillingham agreed to pay the MTA $1.4 million for 
studies and inspection costs associated with repairs of subway tunnels, which 
were built with concrete that was thinner than specified. The firm had 
supervised the construction work. 
</P>
<P>
 As a senior inspector at Parsons Dillingham, Pate oversaw the installation of 
an impermeable membrane in the subway tunnel that was designed to keep gas, 
toxic substances and water in the surrounding soils from seeping into the 
concrete tunnel and stations. 
</P>
<P>
 On several occasions, Pate refused to approve what he believed was "shoddy and 
improper workmanship," according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons Dillingham has denied this allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pate was laid off in April, 1991, two years after he was hired. During his 
stint with Parsons, he received merit raises and "numerous commendations" and 
"received no complaints, reprimands, warnings or any other indication 
whatsoever that any aspect of his performance was less than acceptable," 
according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In his lawsuit, Pate alleged that when he applied for work with other 
companies involved with the subway construction, his former supervisor 
"intentionally and with malice misrepresented to prospective employers that 
(Pate) was not qualified." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Roberts, Pate's attorney, said he believed the jury was persuaded about 
the merits of Pate's case after he presented an eyewitness who heard that 
supervisor talking on the phone with Pate's prospective employer and a 
deposition from the potential employer describing his conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 "A previous employer cannot prevent a person from getting a job," Roberts 
said. "The verdict was very fair."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MACARTHUR PARK; CITY 
BANS NEW ARTWORK IN PARK PENDING CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MacArthur Park is not typically considered the artistic center of Los Angeles, 
but city officials this week imposed a moratorium on the placement of art 
within the park, saying it has become cluttered with cultural wares. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more than 25 statues, plaques, murals and fountains within MacArthur 
Park, which officials say stems from the park's proximity to the Otis-Parsons 
Institute of Art and Design. 
</P>
<P>
 "The park is literally cluttered with art work, most of which is in dire need 
of repair and restoration," Jackie Tatum, general manager of the city's 
Department of Recreation and Parks, said in a report. "The addition of more art 
will only contribute to the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Tatum said maintenance shortages and changes in the surrounding neighborhood 
have changed the park considerably since much of the artwork went up a decade 
ago as part of the MacArthur Park Public Art Program. The moratorium will last 
until the park's condition is improved and the artwork already there is 
restored. 
</P>
<P>
 One remnant on its way out of the park is the pedestal of a statue of King 
Carlos III of Spain, which sits on a grassy knoll in the park's southwestern 
corner. The statue itself was moved to Olvera Street in 1987 but the base 
remained, becoming a favorite target of vandals. This week, the Board of 
Recreation and Park Commissioners ordered it removed.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE UNION PERSUADES 
COMPANY TO CHANGE BILLBOARD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles police union has put up some controversial billboards of its 
own -- but members were not amused when they saw the latest advertisement from 
Sharp Electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 The billboards show Sharp's new video camera, the Viewcam, with a police car 
in the viewfinder -- which some officers found a bit too reminiscent of the 
videotaped beating of Rodney G. King. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Staggs, president of the Police Protective League, was responsible for 
the ominous carjacking billboards that the union put up during its recent labor 
dispute with the city. But the Sharp ads struck a nerve among officers and 
Staggs complained to company officials, who agreed to change the billboards in 
the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was extremely surprised that someone would read that deeply into it," said 
Daniel J. Infanti, Sharp's vice president for corporate communications. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no intention of poking fun, but if it's that sensitive of an issue 
we're willing to change it." MARC LACEY

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 HUNTINGTON PARK 
OFFICERS FIRED OVER MISCONDUCT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Huntington Park Police Department has fired two officers after an internal 
investigation launched last month uncovered alleged misconduct by the former 
members of an elite enforcement team, the city's interim police chief said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Keith Walker, 33, a seven-year veteran of the force, was fired 
effective Thursday for overtime fraud. Investigators said that during a 
six-month period in 1992, Walker, a former school Drug Abuse Resistance 
Education (DARE) officer, falsely submitted payroll time sheets for at least 
$4,000 in classroom visits that he never made, Chief Bill Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I cannot tolerate is theft," Reed said. "If an officer is 
dishonest, he has got to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Robert Mercado, 48, a 16-year veteran, was dismissed July 21 after 
investigators found that he had failed to follow department procedure on 
several occasions, Reed said. Investigators allege that Mercado falsified a 
police report to cover up the accidental discharge of a shotgun by an Explorer, 
a member of a department-sponsored youth group. In addition, investigators 
found nine parking citations in Mercado's desk drawer that had never been 
processed, Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Mercado nor Walker could be reached for comment. Their attorney, Diane 
Marchant, said her clients were being punished for their association with 
retiring Police Chief Frank Sullivan, who was placed on administrative leave in 
May and stepped down amid allegations of misconduct, favoritism and 
discrimination within the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the alleged misconduct occurred during the time when Sullivan was 
chief," Marchant said. "(The department) is cleaning house. They got rid of 
Sullivan and they just want to get rid of anyone who was viewed as being 
affiliated with Sullivan." 
</P>
<P>
 Both men will appeal the city's decision to the county Civil Service 
Commission, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The internal inquiry that led to the dismissals stemmed from allegations in a 
sexual harassment claim filed against the department earlier this year by 
Officer Gina Scolari. The investigation has targeted at least six officers who 
were members of the Crime Impact Team, which was created in 1990 to handle 
drug, gang and other special assignments. The eight-member unit, which was led 
by Sullivan, was disbanded in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Scolari's attorney, Jack O'Donnell, would not comment on his client's ongoing 
negotiations with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed said he would complete the investigation before deciding whether to turn 
criminal allegations over to the district attorney or another agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the former Crime Impact Team members are not reporting for duty. 
Former unit member Sgt. D.J. Fitzgerald has taken a 30-day sick leave, citing 
stomach problems, Reed said. Officer Ray Martin last week requested a leave of 
absence of an undetermined length, citing stress-related illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, former officer Yvette Polley, who filed a wrongful termination 
lawsuit against Sullivan and the city last year, has settled her case and is 
scheduled to return to work Aug. 15, said City Atty. Steven N. Skolnik. Polley, 
who was an officer in training when she was dismissed in July, 1993, will 
receive about $45,000 in back pay and $25,000 for attorney's fees. MARY HELEN

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA MONICA; CITY 
COUNCIL TO ALLOW LEASHED DOGS IN PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City parks here are going to the dogs. Literally. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in more than 50 years, Santa Monica will allow leashed dogs 
in all of its city parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an ordinance approved by the City Council, dogs will also be able to run 
free in designated areas of two city parks -- Josyln and Marine -- during 
specified morning hours. The law was approved after a six-week trial and a 
heated debated last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I've been able to walk my dog, it's become a place where people talk to 
each other," said Robert Malkin, a dog owner who walks his dog in Palisades 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Many credited their dogs with creating a sense of community and reviving legal 
activities in parks overrun by prostitutes, drug dealers and the homeless. 
Others claimed their dogs initiated networking sessions that led to business 
deals, and that they encouraged small talk with fellow dog owners. 
</P>
<P>
 But angry residents would hear none of that. 
</P>
<P>
 They complained about the intrusion of dirty, noisy dogs who litter their 
lawns with feces and spray their grass with urine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked hard and saved my pennies so that I could live a life of serenity 
and tranquillity, and then the dogs came. Dozens of them, barking and 
urinating," said Linda Watson, who lives near one of the parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new law, dog owners will be fined $100 if they fail to clean up 
after their pets. All dogs using the park must be licensed and tagged. The 
designated areas where unleashed dogs can run free will be open every day from 
5 to 8:30 a.m. The "off-leash" program may be extended to two additional sites.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; $153.5 
MILLION OKD FOR CITY HALL SEISMIC WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved spending $153.5 million for seismic work and 
repair of earthquake damage at City Hall, although leasing or building a 
comparable edifice would cost less. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said the restoration is justified because the 66-year-old 
building is the historic seat of municipal government and the city's most 
recognizable landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great symbol of our city government and of our city as a whole," said 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. "I wish we could do it for cheaper. I hope it's 
going to be kept to this cost." 
</P>
<P>
 The price tag for refurbishing City Hall disturbed some council members 
because project managers initially pegged it at $92 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-year project will entail seismic upgrades, quake-related repairs, 
safety improvements such as automatic sprinklers and new fire exit stairwells, 
a modernized electrical system and a new fueling station in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous cracks appeared in stairwells and the upper floors after the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake. In the tower walls, people can see through the cracks, 
said officials who toured the upper floors. 
</P>
<P>
 The restoration work will force employees in offices above the fourth floor to 
relocate. City Engineer Robert S. Horii recommended moving workers out of the 
11th through 27th floors immediately, with the rest following once the major 
seismic work begins in March.

AGAINST OFFICER IN BAR INCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying they wanted to send a message that guns and alcohol don't mix, Burbank 
prosecutors on Wednesday filed criminal misdemeanor charges against a Los 
Angeles police officer, alleging that he illegally displayed a gun in a 
threatening manner in a drunken barroom confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer, Peter Ceinion Jones of the LAPD's prestigious Metropolitan 
Division, also threatened a bartender at the Blue Room in Burbank who told him 
to put the gun away, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Weapons and alcohol are a terrible, terrible, terrible combination. Police 
officers, if anyone, should know that, and should know better," said Burbank 
Deputy City Atty. Robert Walters. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who has twice been suspended without pay for several days by the LAPD 
after other incidents, is the subject of a departmental investigation into his 
conduct in the bar, an LAPD spokeswoman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was unavailable for comment.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PACOIMA; PARK WILL BE 
RENAMED FOR SINGER RITCHIE VALENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ritchie Valens, the Latino youth who was born in a blue-collar Pacoima 
neighborhood and grew up to become a rock 'n' roll legend, gained new 
distinction this week when a Los Angeles city commission agreed to rename a 
Pacoima park in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous vote by the Recreation and Parks Commission was applauded by a 
handful of Valens' relatives and friends, some of whom wore T-shirts with his 
name and smiling face emblazoned across the front and back. 
</P>
<P>
 Valens, born Richard Valenzuela, gained fame in the 1950s and died at the age 
of 17 along with Buddy Holly and J. P. (the Big Bopper) Richardson in a 1959 
plane crash that is still considered one of the greatest tragedies in pop music 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Valens became a teen-age idol on the strength of such hits as "Come On, Let's

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: HAWAIIAN GARDENS; MAN 
CHARGED IN ATTACK ON WOMAN WHO NEARLY DIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attempted murder charges were filed this week against a convicted murderer 
accused of attacking a Hawaiian Gardens woman a year ago and leaving her for 
dead.  
</P>
<P>
 The victim spent four days in a garage until she was found, barely alive.She 
was in a coma for months before she recovered and assisted authorities in 
arresting the suspect, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Clifton H. Garrott.  
</P>
<P>
 James Lum Shamburger, 47, was charged with one count of attempted first-degree 
murder and one count of attempted rape. 
</P>
<P>
 Bail was recommended at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrott said the victim was picked up in the Hawaiian Gardens area last Aug. 
27 and taken to a vacant garage and attacked, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the woman struggled, she was hit on the head with a hatchet or similar 
sharp-edged instrument and the attacker fled, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 31, a man who was looking for his girlfriend's dog peered into the 
partially open garage and smelled what he believed to be the odor of a 
decomposing body, Garrott said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man summoned sheriff's deputies, who felt the woman's pulse and believed 
that she was dead. When homicide detectives arrived, one discovered that she 
was breathing.  
</P>
<P>
 Garrott said the unidentified victim, who is in her late 20s, was hospitalized 
for months. After coming out of the coma, she assisted sheriff's detectives in 
their investigation, leading to Shamburger's arrest on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said Shamburger served 11 years in prison for the Aug. 3, 1977, 
murder of his wife in Los Angeles. She was beaten on the head with a baseball 
bat.

POLICE KILL MAN WHO BRANDISHES FAKE GUN; LAPD: OFFICERS RESPONDING TO 911 CALL 
NEAR LINCOLN PARK SAY VICTIM APPEARED TO DRAW A .38-CALIBER REVOLVER. IT TURNED 
OUT TO BE MADE OF PLASTIC. COUNCILMAN VISITS THE SCENE AFTER SOME WITNESSES 
PROTEST SHOOTING.

<P>
 A bare-chested man brandishing a toy gun on a street corner near Lincoln Park 
was shot and killed Thursday afternoon after a confrontation with Los Angeles 
police, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, whose identity was not immediately released, was shot shortly after 
4:30 p.m. in the 3300 block of North Mission Road, said Los Angeles Police 
Capt. Bruce Hagerty. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagerty said police had been called to the neighborhood by residents who 
dialed 911 to report that the man was on the sidewalk brandishing a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 When officers arrived, the man was standing at the corner and officers ordered 
him to get down, Hagerty said. Instead, he said, the man reached behind his 
back into the rear waistband of his pants and pulled out what appeared to be a 
blue-steel, .38-caliber revolver. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the officers, Hagerty said, "could clearly see the man's hand on the 
gun and fired." The officer, whom he would not identify, fired three rounds, he 
said, shooting the man in the upper torso. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon investigation, police discovered that the gun was not real, but "a very 
realistic replica" made out of plastic, Hagerty said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting brought complaints from witnesses who protested the police 
response, Hagerty said, and City Councilman Richard Alatorre went to the scene 
to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people who have a different point of view as to what happened," 
Alatorre said, without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagerty, however, said that except for two people, the crowd that gathered 
around the scene of the incident was generally peaceful and "just curious." 
</P>
<P>
 He added detectives were not immediately able to discern why the man was 
waving the toy pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're investigating to find out exactly what he was doing," Hagerty said. 
"Obviously, he concerned somebody because they called 911."

RESIDENTS OPPOSE AIR FORCE PLAN FOR OCEAN VIEW HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Air Force officials have leased 26 acres of prime ocean view real estate in 
San Pedro, where they plan to build about 150 housing units, hoping to lure top 
space industry engineers and their families to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But they faced heated opposition from San Pedro residents when they unveiled 
the plan at a community meeting this week. Most of the 150 residents who 
attended the meeting said they are not convinced that the new development next 
to Angeles Gate Park is needed. They said the next round of military base 
closures, scheduled to begin in the fall, could affect the Los Angeles Air 
Force Base in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Col. Phillip E. Johnson, public affairs director of the Space and Missile 
Systems Center in El Segundo, said prime housing is used to compensate Air 
Force engineers who could demand much higher pay in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force spokesman Howard B. Antelis said that Air Force officers can refuse 
assignments, and that attracting engineers to work on satellite research and 
design in Los Angeles has been difficult because of earthquakes, crime and the 
high cost of living. 
</P>
<P>
 Houses with an ocean view help lure the caliber of workers that the Air Force 
needs, Antelis said. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the Air Force signed a 50-year lease for the property with the Los 
Angeles Unified School District for $1 a year, said district Planning Director 
Dominic Shambra. 
</P>
<P>
 The property is part of 47 acres known as the Ft. MacArthur Upper Reservation, 
which the school district has owned since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the lease, the state, county or Los Angeles must compensate the district 
or provide another property by August, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The building plans angered residents who have been embroiled in a bitter fight 
over another military housing complex on Taper Avenue. The 144 housing units 
will be abandoned by the Navy when the Long Beach Naval Station closes in 
September. A shelter for 880 homeless people was approved for the site in 
January, but federal officials are reconsidering the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said the Air Force should use the Navy housing site instead of 
developing open parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 "In good faith we are asking that the military be a good neighbor to San Pedro 
and take over the Taper Avenue site," San Pedro resident John Washworth told 
Air Force officials Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lt. Col. Gilbert T. Perry, director of acquisitions for civil engineering, 
said the Taper Avenue housing is below Air Force standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Shambra said that during last year's negotiations, concerns were raised that 
the Air Force would pull out of Los Angeles if it could not get the Ft. 
MacArthur site. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of jobs at stake in Los Angeles, and I think it was in 
everyone's best interest to provide the housing so the Air Force could remain," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelis said, however, that the decision to keep or close the Los Angeles base 
will not be made by the Air Force but by the national Base Closure Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force personnel have lived in San Pedro since 1982 in three sites with 574 
units. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the closest base is in El Segundo, the Air Force has built housing in 
San Pedro because it had space available for a large number of units, Antelis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another public hearing will be scheduled this winter when a draft 
environmental report on the planned development is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force plans to begin building the housing in September, 1995, Antelis 
said.

HUD FINDS 60% OF NAVY SURPLUS LAND UNFIT FOR HOMELESS PROJECT; SHELTER: IN 
SETBACK TO PROPOSED SAN PEDRO DEVELOPMENT, AGENCY SAYS HOUSING IS TOO CLOSE TO 
AVIATION FUEL TANKS. PLANS HAVE MET INTENSE LOCAL OPPOSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a setback for a proposed South Bay homeless project, the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development has ruled that dozens of surplus Navy housing 
units in San Pedro are unsuitable for the plan because they are too close to 
aviation fuel tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 The HUD ruling prompted Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey) on Thursday to 
call on Turner's Technical Institute, the South-Central group that seeks to 
operate the controversial shelter, to begin anew the federal application 
procedure for such a project. 
</P>
<P>
 Institute officials could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
 HUD will publish its findings in the Federal Register today, declaring that 19 
of the 23 four-unit buildings, 12 of the two-unit buildings and eight of the 16 
carports -- nearly 60% of the structures on the site -- are within 2,000 feet 
of two privately owned aviation fuel tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The department had assumed that the tanks were Navy property and would be 
removed by the time the Long Beach Naval Station closes in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The HUD findings apparently means that the scope of any homeless project would 
have to be smaller, so the application process for operating such a proposal 
should be reopened, Harman said in a letter to Donna Shalala, secretary of the 
Department of Health and Human Services. That agency is also reviewing the 
institute's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea what Turner's financial or professional qualifications are to 
do this (smaller) project, but I didn't believe it had the financial and 
professional qualifications to do the (larger shelter)," Harman said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the federal McKinney Act, HHS in January approved Turner's application 
to establish a homeless shelter for up to 880 people on 27 acres of surplus 
land that has been used to house Navy personnel and their families. The 
announcement caught local officials by surprise, and public opposition to the 
project quickly became intense. 
</P>
<P>
 Inconsistencies in the institute's application came to light, and doubts were 
raised about the ability of the group to manage such an ambitious undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Both HUD and HHS were pressured to review their approvals of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman hopes that if HHS goes along with the suggestion, a committee of 
residents known as the San Pedro Area Reuse Committee will be able to put 
together an application from local homeless groups that can meet the criteria 
of the McKinney Act, which gives homeless organizations first crack at surplus 
federal property. 
</P>
<P>
 Doane Liu, chairman of the residents' committee, was pleased by the HUD 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our argument is that the property should be rescreened (by the Navy) because 
it is a whole new piece of property, considerably different than the original. 
We will ask the Navy to reconsider whether they even want to (offer it as) 
surplus. We want them to go back to the beginning," Liu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach base closures manager Kimberly Kesler said the Navy will ask state 
and local agencies if they want to use the portion of the Taper Avenue site 
that has been declared unsuitable for a homeless shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the Navy also can start from scratch and screen Department of Defense 
and federal agencies that are interested in that part of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those agencies that may apply will have precedence over any state or local 
agency," Kesler said. "The reuse committee needs to look at its objective 
before they ask us to start all over." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harman said she anticipates that the HHS review of the shelter proposal will 
be completed within several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 If HHS rules that the land is unfit for habitation, Harman said, it might be 
used as parkland or open space.

PROTESTERS BLOCK SLUDGE DUMPING AT RESERVATION; ENVIRONMENT: TRIBAL LEADERS 
ORDER HALT TO DELIVERY OF WASTE FROM LOS ANGELES AND ORANGE COUNTIES. THEY SAY 
WATER SUPPLY HAS BEEN TAINTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Members of the Torres Martinez band of Desert Cahuilla Indians protested the 
dumping of sludge on their reservation Thursday, carrying picket signs and 
blocking the path of trucks carrying sewage to their community in this rural 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 Private waste management companies truck more than 3,000 tons of solid waste 
to the reservation from Los Angeles and Orange counties each week, dumping it 
on 120 acres they lease from Torres Martinez tribal member Geraldine Ibanez. 
</P>
<P>
 But tribal leaders -- backed by the U.S. Department of the Interior -- have 
ordered the contractors to halt delivery of the sludge, while the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs tries to find ways to dispose of the 470,000 tons of solid waste 
piled five stories high. 
</P>
<P>
 Tribal elder Alec Dominguez, who owns land across the road from the sludge 
heap, says the reservation's water supply has been contaminated and residents' 
health has been jeopardized by the growing pile of manure, which attracts 
hordes of flies and emits enough dust so that children must be kept inside on 
windy days.  
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Mirelez, 12, who spent hours protesting with his mother Thursday, said 
his young cousin had to move from the reservation because she became ill after 
living near the sludge dump. "I would like it just to disappear," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 More than 40 tribal members and Los Angeles-area environmentalists marched in 
120-degree heat, forcing trucks carrying loads of smelly sludge to turn back. 
Riverside County sheriff's deputies watched the protest, but no arrests were 
made.

MIDDLE CLASS LOSING OUT IN HEALTH CARE DEBATE; REFORM: PROPOSALS ARE FAVORING 
POOREST, YOUNGEST AND OLDEST AMERICANS. LEFT BEHIND ARE THOSE IN THE MIDDLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN TUMULTY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Suddenly, the fault lines of class and generation are opening up in the health 
care debate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the scramble to transform the nation's health care system, the poorest, 
youngest and -- to some extent -- the oldest Americans are coming out ahead. 
Inevitably, some of their gain is coming at the expense of those in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 And as Congress continues to pare back President Clinton's original grandiose 
proposal, the divide is growing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The group that is most likely to be helped least -- at least as the 
discussion stands now -- is the working middle class . . . which is a little 
surprising, since it was the rise of middle-class concern that put this issue 
on the front burner in the first place," said Drew Altman, president of the 
Kaiser Family Foundation, a private, nonprofit health care philanthropy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is the irony lost on Paul M. Ellwood Jr., the intellectual father of the 
"managed competition" theory that Clinton has said is the foundation of his own 
approach to health reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "The political driver of health care reform was not some new-found concern 
with the have-nots of society. The political driver was the fact that we had a 
very worried middle class," Ellwood said, adding that some of those concerns 
"have fallen by the wayside." 
</P>
<P>
 It is by now well known that working people of modest income account for the 
largest share of the uninsured. But it is becoming just as evident that 
Clinton's chief proposal for covering them -- a requirement that employers pay 
80% of their health benefits -- has virtually no chance of surviving intact. 
</P>
<P>
 If the so-called "employer mandate" materializes at all, it is not likely to 
happen until the early years of the next century. Even then, it seems certain 
to be pared back, possibly to 50%, shifting onto middle-class workers the 
burden -- impossibly heavy for some -- of paying thousands of dollars a year 
out of their own pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 House and Senate Democratic leaders hope to bridge the gap with billions of 
dollars in government spending, but for political as well as substantive 
reasons, middle-class people will be last in a long line to receive those 
subsidies. And it is far from certain how much money will actually be 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Children and pregnant women appear certain to come first, followed by 
low-income adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), in his plan which will 
serve as the vehicle for Senate debate, has proposed that the government pay 
the entire insurance premium for pregnant women and children with incomes up to 
185% of the poverty level -- or about $27,000 for a family of four. Up to 300% 
of poverty, or about $44,000 for the same-sized family, the government would 
pay at least part of the premium. 
</P>
<P>
 The payments for poor adults would be less generous, with full subsidies 
available only to those at poverty or under, and partial payments on a sliding 
scale up to 200% of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 The program would begin in 1997, which means that all those groups would be 
assured some government help in meeting their health bills at least five years 
before the rest of the population is guaranteed coverage. The Mitchell bill 
calls for 95% of the country to be covered by the year 2000, imposing a 50% 
employer mandate in 2002 if voluntary measures fail to meet that target in 
individual states. 
</P>
<P>
 House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) also has proposed full 
subsidies for families below the poverty level and some government help for 
those earning 240% of that level, about $38,400 for a family of four. Benefits 
under his plan would begin in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 To a large degree, these priorities reflect the scarcity of government 
resources available. "If you're not going to be all-encompassing, you look then 
to the populations with greatest needs," said Diane Rowland, the Kaiser Family 
Foundation's executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the provisions also have a political dimension. They amount to something 
of a consolation prize for congressional liberals, who are increasingly 
disquieted and dismayed by their leaders' retreat from the more ambitious 
provisions of the Clinton plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberals form the core of the health bill's support and House and Senate 
leaders cannot afford to lose their votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The relative immediacy of those provisions is a major selling point. Even if 
other parts of the bill were undone by a future Congress before going into 
effect, existing programs would be hard to dismantle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be looking very carefully at this legislation to judge what it 
does right away, not just what it promises many years from now. We have a 
chance to make substantial gains covering more people -- especially children 
and the elderly -- almost as soon as this legislation is signed," said Rep. 
Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who chairs an important health subcommittee 
and is Congress' most dogged champion of health coverage for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefits themselves are significantly more generous for children of all 
income groups. Under the Mitchell plan, those younger than 22 would be the only 
group assured coverage of vision, hearing and dental care in private health 
plans. Gephardt would provide the same group with preventive services without 
out-of-pocket cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are good parts of both of them (the Gephardt and Mitchell plans). We're 
very supportive of what's being done in both houses," said Eileen Sweeney of 
the Children's Defense Fund, a children's advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
 Elderly groups, however, have been somewhat reluctant to embrace the plans, 
primarily because they are still evaluating the reductions in Medicare growth 
that both envision. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional leaders insist that the cuts will affect doctors and hospitals, 
not elderly beneficiaries. The Mitchell plan would reduce projected growth in 
Medicare by $54 billion over five years, about half as much as the Gephardt 
proposal. Both figures are lower than the $124 billion in cutbacks that Clinton 
proposed, a reflection of an intense lobbying campaign by elderly groups. 
</P>
<P>
 And older people, many of whom have had to decide all too often between buying 
food or life-sustaining drugs, have the most to gain from new Medicare coverage 
of prescription drugs. Under the Mitchell bill, the benefit would begin in 1999 
and is estimated to be worth $100 billion. Beneficiaries would pay 20% of the 
costs of their drugs, up to $1,275 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The elderly also are the chief beneficiaries of long-term care benefits that 
could keep them in their own homes, rather than in nursing homes. Under both 
the Gephardt and Mitchell bills, the federal government would give the states 
grants with which to establish such care programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Those drug and long-term care benefits in the House and Senate bills have been 
scaled back from the levels proposed by Clinton but still would represent "a 
big step forward," Waxman said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the group least likely to have insurance -- healthy people in their 
20s and early 30s -- are likely to see the cost of buying it increase. This is 
because of a much-touted change, part of virtually every health reform 
proposal, that would curtail the insurance company practice of charging 
different rates to people on the basis of their age and their health. 
</P>
<P>
 Healthy young people thus would lose the price break they get now -- which, by 
some estimates, could amount to a transfer of as much as $40 billion a year 
from those who are under 35 to those who are between 35 and 64. 
</P>
<P>
 What those under 35 would get in return, according to proponents of the idea, 
are less tangible, but nonetheless important benefits -- such as the knowledge 
that they could never be denied coverage when they are sick and need it. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the health debate has resounded with the heart-wrenching stories of 
those whose "pre-existing conditions" have made health coverage unobtainable. 
As recently as Wednesday night, Clinton used his nationally televised news 
conference to draw the attention of tens of millions of Americans to the plight 
of Daniel Lumley, a Seattle man who suffered severe injuries in a motorcycle 
accident and subsequently has been uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Kaiser Foundation's Altman said that such cases are "not as big a 
cause of being uninsured as the speeches would lead you to believe it is." Most 
people in that situation, he added, can get at least partial coverage, 
excluding the problem condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Insurance reform will have a modest, perhaps even negligible impact on the 
uninsured," Altman said.

COUNTY REVERSES POLICY ON HOMEOWNERS FIGHTING FIRES; DISASTERS: OFFICIALS HOLD 
EXPOS TO HELP RESIDENTS LEARN TECHNIQUES. HEAVY LOSSES IN 1993 BLAZES PROMPTED 
CHANGE.

<P>
 In the past, the sight of a homeowner squirting water on a roof in the middle 
of a brush fire has been one of the last things firefighters wanted to see.  
</P>
<P>
 But last fall's disastrous brush fires have caused Los Angeles County fire 
officials to change their minds -- and their policy -- about discouraging 
homeowners from staying to save their own homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities are now offering to help residents learn how to protect their 
property and use professional-type firefighting equipment to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a change in our thinking," county fire Capt. Steve Valenzuela said. "But 
it's a fact of life that people are going to stay behind . . . if people are 
going to help us by staying, the best way they can do that is to be prepared in 
advance." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners living in isolated neighborhoods in mountains and canyons on the 
outskirts of Los Angeles will be taught how to assess the risk of staying. 
Those who decide to stick it out will be given advice on preparing their house 
for a stand against an approaching fire and on the proper firefighting gear to 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are staging a series of wildfire expos to give homeowners a chance 
to purchase equipment ranging from goggles and flame-resistant clothing to 
sophisticated rooftop sprinklers that can be activated by heat sensors -- or by 
a telephone call from a resident who is away from home when a brush fire breaks 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of traffic problems during brush fires, residents who are away from 
home -- or those who decide to evacuate -- will not be allowed to return until 
after the emergency is over, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other devices being demonstrated at the expos include sprinkler systems that 
capture and recycle runoff water from roofs, and pumps that can operate fire 
hoses from swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
 More novel are water-saving foam nozzle systems that can coat a house with a 
soapy fire retardant that will stick for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a back-yard Jacuzzi, you have enough water to foam your whole 
house," said Steve Miller, whose Tech Flow Industries of Glendale is one of 
nearly four dozen private vendors recruited by the county Fire Department to 
display firefighting equipment at the expos. "If you have a swimming pool, you 
can protect the whole neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials acknowledge that there is a danger that panicky amateur 
firefighters could drain their local water systems, hampering the efforts of 
the professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're preaching conservation -- don't waste water too far ahead of the fire," 
said Valenzuela, who has helped organize the expos. 
</P>
<P>
 County fire officials say their change of heart came after they were unable to 
save about 475 homes in Altadena and Malibu, where residents were discouraged 
from fighting fires on their own. "People looked at their neighborhoods and saw 
three-fourths of the homes destroyed and they almost felt betrayed by their 
fire service," said county Fire Chief P. Michael Freeman, who proposed the new 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not taking a position to urge anyone to stay," Freeman said. "We're 
just trying to capitalize on lessons from our recent experiences with a very 
disastrous fire season."  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles city fire officials are closely watching the county's efforts, 
city Battalion Chief Jim Haworth said. He said that the brush fire danger this 
year could rival that of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're so effective at putting out the small fires in the summer that we're 
allowing large areas of brush to become older and more decadent," Haworth said. 
"There's more of it now to burn . . . and more people living in the hills to be 
jeopardized by it than ever before." 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 people attended an initial expo last weekend in Santa Clarita, 
according to fire Inspector Michael Chuck. The next one is scheduled for 10 
a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday at the San Dimas Civic Center, 245 E. Bonita Ave. Expos 
are planned for coming weekends in Malibu, Palos Verdes and Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the vendors' displays, booths operated by a dozen or so public 
agencies will provide information on such topics as animal control, livestock 
evacuation and Red Cross shelter services, Chuck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a videotape showing firefighting techniques is being shown at the 
expos, the county is stopping short of training do-it-yourself firefighters -- 
at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll offer advice," such as how to ride out the peak of a wildfire by 
closing yourself in the house as the flames reach your property, Valenzuela 
said. After 5 or 10 minutes, it will probably be safe enough to go outside and 
try to extinguish any ignition points on the house, according to experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we haven't gone so far as to put them through the firefighter training 
academy yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other changes are being initiated by the county Fire Department through what 
it calls Operation Firestop: 
</P>
<P>
 * Residents of the Whittier Hills area are being invited to an Aug. 13 tour of 
canyon areas to hear firefighters explain where brush fires historically burn 
and where safe refuge areas for residents will likely be during future fires. 
</P>
<P>
 * For the first time, fixed-wing airplanes that can drop tons of fire 
retardant on hillsides in a single sweep will be automatically summoned on 
every two-alarm brush fire response. 
</P>
<P>
 * Beefed-up mutual aid agreements with the Los Angeles City Fire Department 
will allow for quicker deployment of water-dropping city helicopters on 
unincorporated hillsides. On dry, hot and windy days when there is a potential 
for brush fires, some inner-city fire trucks will be assigned to stand by near 
brushy areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Neighborhood arson patrols are being increased through the Sheriff's 
Department. About 500 volunteers have been recruited -- including a new group 
in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * A mailer offering brush fire safety tips and suggestions that homeowners in 
unincorporated areas and 22 hill-area cities covered by the county Fire 
Department will be sent in about two weeks to 435,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hillside residents said they are pleased with the county's reaction to last 
fall's firestorm disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know people who stayed and saved their homes," said Gretchen Hayes -- 
whose Malibu residence was destroyed. "If we knew our risk, we could have 
better defended ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 But Altadena resident Ursula Hyman said staying to protect your home is not 
for everybody.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think a note of caution is needed. Clearly some residents could have saved 
their homes if they were present. In other cases there might have been a loss 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm giving the Fire Department higher and higher marks as we go along."

SERBIA CUTS OFF BOSNIAN REBELS; BALKANS: BELGRADE, UNDER INTERNATIONAL 
PRESSURE, SAYS IT IS DENYING SUPPLIES OF FUEL AND ARMS TO FORCES IT HAS 
SUPPORTED. WASHINGTON CAUTIOUSLY WELCOMES MOVE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, mastermind of the conflict that has 
racked the Balkans for three years, announced Thursday that he was cutting 
support for his proxy warriors in Bosnia-Herzegovina for their refusal to 
relinquish the dream he inspired of a Greater Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbia and Montenegro, the last two republics in the rump Yugoslavia, also 
proclaimed their territory off-limits to Bosnian Serb leaders. The Bosnian 
Serbs have refused to bow to pressure, even from their patrons in Belgrade, to 
cede some conquered land to the Muslim-led Bosnian government as the price for 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
 In statements released in Belgrade, the Serbian and Yugoslav capital, 
Milosevic urged Bosnian Serbs to overthrow the leaders whom he branded "war 
profiteers." 
</P>
<P>
 He specifically targeted Radovan Karadzic, a Belgrade protege who has presided 
over the 28-month-old rebellion and seized 70% of Bosnian territory with a view 
to annexing it to Milosevic's state. 
</P>
<P>
 But the international community last week stepped up the pressure on Milosevic 
with threats of tighter sanctions against Serbia, compelling him to cut vital 
fuel and weapons supplies that have nurtured the deadly rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Belgrade-based Tanjug news agency said the rump Yugoslavia was breaking 
all economic and political ties with Bosnian Serb rebels because they had 
rejected a proposed territorial division worked out by senior diplomats from 
the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany -- the so-called Contact 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia froze its contacts with the Karadzic forces a day earlier and appealed 
to Milosevic to continue pressuring his proxies to compromise and make peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington welcomed the Yugoslav move to rein in the Bosnian Serbs, but White 
House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers noted it would bear watching to see "if 
that border actually seals up." 
</P>
<P>
 "We welcome any steps to continue to put pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to 
accept the Contact Group's proposal," she said, adding: "With reference 
specifically to Serbia, we've heard these kinds of statements before. . . . I 
think what we want to see is action, not just words. But certainly if they mean 
what they say, that would be a positive step." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials also warned that pressure was mounting in Congress for lifting 
an arms embargo that has prevented Bosnian government forces from defending 
their country. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said the United States might 
decide to defy a U.N. embargo and arm the Bosnian government if the Bosnian 
Serbs persist in refusing to accept the peace settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This seemed to signal a change in policy; the Clinton Administration has 
insisted many times before that the United States would respect the embargo so 
long as its European allies refused to join in lifting it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Panetta told Cable News Network that if the Bosnian Serbs continue "to 
fight this issue . . . ultimately we will seek a multilateral lifting of the 
embargo, and if necessary, a unilateral lifting of the embargo." He maintained 
that the United States would act unilaterally only as a last resort. "First we 
want to put maximum pressure on them to come around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Milosevic last year vowed to shut his country's border with Bosnia to punish 
the rebels for spurning an earlier Western peace plan. But that announcement 
proved to be posturing as Karadzic and his fellow warlords continued to enjoy 
support, advice and refuge in Belgrade, where they have spent much of their 
time since fleeing homes in Sarajevo so they could lay siege to the Bosnian 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The current threats appeared more serious, at least for the moment, as 
Yugoslav authorities turned back a senior official of the rogue leadership when 
she attempted to cross into their territory. Yugoslav border guards barred 
self-styled Vice President Biljana Plavsic from returning to her Belgrade 
apartment after a Wednesday night leadership session meted out a final 
rejection of the peace plan, the Associated Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serbs are entirely dependent on Serbian-led Yugoslavia for the 
money and munitions needed to wage war. 
</P>
<P>
 In denouncing the five-nation peace plan, Karadzic warned his armed followers 
that they risked deprivation and isolation but that to capitulate to the peace 
plan would be tantamount to national suicide. Bosnian Serb nationalists would 
have to withdraw from about one-third of the land they have conquered in 
Bosnia, under terms of the peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more objectionable, in the rebels' view, is that acceptance would mean 
endorsement of the internationally recognized borders of Bosnia -- forever 
signing away their chances of unifying captured lands there and in Croatia into 
an expanded Serbian state. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebel leadership has called for a referendum on the peace plan Aug. 27-28 
and suggested approval could be engineered if the international mediators would 
give in to their sovereignty demands. 
</P>
<P>
 That has already been rejected by the American and European mediators, who 
presented their peace plan -- at least the fourth proposed formula for dividing 
Bosnia -- as a take-it-or-leave-it offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Milosevic may be heeding the advice of Russian authorities to push the Bosnian 
Serbs for compliance in hopes of getting sanctions lifted whether the rebels 
sign the peace plan or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly S. Churkin commented earlier this week 
that it would be "paradoxical" to continue punishing Serbia and Montenegro with 
economic sanctions if they were doing all they could to persuade the Bosnian 
Serbs to settle. After his visit to Belgrade on Monday, Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev expressed broad support for Milosevic in what he 
suggested was a genuine effort to get the rebels to accept the peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Milosevic has proved a master at forging and breaking alliances as 
circumstances suit him. He arranged the political ouster of Croatian Serb 
leader Milan Babic after that proxy warlord refused in late 1991 to endorse a 
plan for deploying U.N. peacekeepers to divided Croatia. The Serbian strongman 
has also repeatedly threatened to cut the supply lifeline to conquered areas of 
Croatia whenever international pressure has been brought to bear on him to 
settle disputes there. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Babic has made a political comeback as foreign minister of the rogue 
Republic of Serbian Krajina -- the internationally ostracized but increasingly 
independent territory seized from Croatia -- and the flow of food, fuel and 
weaponry continues there. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers David Lauter and Stanley Meisler in Washington contributed 
to this report. Sealing the Border 
</P>
<P>
 Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and Montenegro, severed political and 
economic ties with Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina after the rebels once again 
rejected an international peace plan.

CAN CAMPAIGNS COMPETE WITH SIMPSON COVERAGE?; POLITICS: CANDIDATES COULD BE 
OVERLOOKED IN WEEKS BEFORE NOV. 8 ELECTION. STRATEGISTS ADJUST THEIR PLANNING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's Tuesday, Nov. 8, and the O.J. Simpson murder trial is heading toward a 
dramatic conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh yes, it also is Election Day in California. Republican Pete Wilson is in a 
bitter down-to-the-wire contest with Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown for 
the governorship, the nation's most important electoral contest this year. A 
pivotal U.S. Senate seat will be decided along with hundreds of other state and 
local races. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era of declining voter participation -- and a populace transfixed by the 
Simpson trial unfolding on television -- could this truly be the year when they 
hold an election and no one comes? 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Secretary of State Tony Miller, California's chief elections officer, 
pondered that scenario for a moment and cracked: "If he's on the stand on the 
eighth of November, we simply shut the process down. I'm not even going to show 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, of course, no one can say whether the Simpson trial will begin 
as scheduled Sept. 19. Or if it does, whether Simpson would take the stand. 
</P>
<P>
 But in small ways and large, the murder case that has drawn unprecedented 
national attention is forcing California's campaign managers and politicians to 
rethink their plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Senate candidate Mike Huffington this week agreed to debate Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) on television, but only if the encounters are held 
before Sept. 19. "Because after Sept. 19, nobody will be paying attention 
anymore," said Marc Thiessen, Huffington's press aide. 
</P>
<P>
 If Simpson's trial on charges of slaying his former wife Nicole Brown Simpson 
and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman does begin in September, jury selection 
could take several weeks and the trial easily could run through the rest of the 
1994 election campaign. Obliterate it, in the view of some. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a relatively routine Simpson murder trial in the closing seven weeks of 
the campaign becomes "a campaign manager's nightmare," said Darry Sragow, a 
veteran Southern California campaign strategist who managed Insurance 
Commissioner John Garamendi's unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination 
for governor this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "The O.J. trial screws up the best of campaign plans because it diverts 
attention. And it's tough enough in California, particularly Southern 
California, to get the attention of voters in a campaign," Sragow added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Major events always have an impact on election campaigns. In 1990, the sudden 
prospect of war in the Persian Gulf shifted attention away from the campaign 
for governor. Two years ago, the Los Angeles riots froze the U.S. Senate 
primary campaigns in place for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson case has been so extraordinary that it may have a larger impact. 
Campaign officials cannot recall any similar event that has so dominated the 
news and so captured public attention for such a sustained period. 
</P>
<P>
 If the trial gets anything like the attention of the preliminary hearing, the 
first half of most newscasts will be devoted to its coverage every day, just as 
candidates are vying to get attention. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, campaign experts say that incumbents, better known candidates, 
those in the lead and Republicans most likely would benefit from events that 
distract attention from the political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The pretrial proceedings already have had an impact. John Whitehurst, press 
secretary for Kathleen Brown's campaign for governor, said Brown's appearances 
are scheduled carefully so they do not conflict with Simpson case events. 
Otherwise, it is a good bet that all the TV news cameras will be at the 
Criminal Courts Building, not at the Brown appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 But Whitehurst said that by staging Brown events at locations near the courts 
building, but not in direct conflict with a Simpson appearance, the candidate 
is more likely to draw news crews. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is most difficult on our campaign," Whitehurst said. "As a challenger, 
one of the key jobs is to demonstrate Wilson's failures in the press every day. 
That challenge gets harder if we don't have as much opportunity to get on 
television." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitehurst and others are hard at work trying to calculate the impact of a 
Simpson trial on their campaigns. A sampling of California political experts 
offered some theories about what might happen if the voting public is riveted 
on Simpson while candidates desperately seek attention: 
</P>
<P>
 * The effect could be particularly devastating to candidates running statewide 
campaigns other than the high-profile races for governor and U.S. senator -- 
lieutenant governor, controller, treasurer, attorney general and the like. Such 
an impact would be accentuated by the fact that Wilson and Atty. Gen. Dan 
Lungren are the only incumbents in statewide offices who are seeking reelection 
to their posts this year. Lots of newcomers are struggling to get known. 
</P>
<P>
 Television exposure of candidates for these lesser offices could be virtually 
wiped out in the event of a Simpson trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * Diminished coverage of the election campaign would tend to help incumbents 
or better-known officials running for other offices. As Whitehurst, the Brown 
aide, noted, challengers usually have a more difficult time getting their 
message across than well-known incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 George Gorton, Wilson's reelection campaign manager, said: "I think it tends 
to help people who are ahead, who are better known, who command the news." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, watch the polling results in mid-September because they might 
not change as much after that as they would in a "normal" election year. 
</P>
<P>
 * The voter turnout on Election Day could drop sharply from past election 
years, even if Simpson is not on the stand that Tuesday, said elections chief 
Miller, who is running for office himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will not have been focusing on the candidates and measures," he said. 
"When they don't know about the candidates and measures, they don't vote. They 
stay away. It's not good news for the process at all." 
</P>
<P>
 In general, campaign experts believe that low voter turnout benefits 
Republican candidates and issues because Republicans are more consistent 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 * Campaign strategists fear that extensive live television coverage of the 
trial might limit the amount of commercial time they can buy for the TV ads 
that are so critical to any statewide election campaign in California, 
especially in the weeks immediately before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But ad slots that might become available next to trial coverage or during 
breaks in the court proceedings would become prime time for campaigns because 
of the expanded daytime viewing audience lured by the trial coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said potential voters would pay more attention to the candidate 
profiles and statements in the official secretary of state's ballot booklet 
that goes to every registered voter. He added that he will encourage absentee 
voting to make it easier to vote in the weeks leading up to Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Some speculate that the Simpson trial might provide an edge of sorts to Wilson 
because it would keep crime in the spotlight. Crime is the keystone issue in 
Wilson's campaign. Sragow said that might be countered by the exposure the 
trial might give to the issue of domestic violence, to Brown's benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, he added, "it could help both." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Sragow was making his comments, the Brown campaign was distributing 
the candidate's schedule for the next day. The first event: a news conference 
on domestic violence at a women's shelter in Santa Monica.

PANEL, CLINTON AIDE SPAR ON WHITEWATER TESTIMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS and SARA FRITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under intense questioning from Republican senators, a senior White House 
official gave contradictory testimony Thursday about a meeting at which Deputy 
Treasury Secretary Roger Altman briefed aides to President Clinton on a 
Whitewater-related investigation by the Resolution Trust Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 In prepared remarks read to the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs 
Committee, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold M. Ickes sought to 
backtrack from testimony he had given in an earlier deposition that was 
particularly damaging to Altman, who is under fire because of allegations that 
he misled Congress about what transpired at the Feb. 2 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in a tense exchange with senators, Ickes later said several times 
that he stood by the testimony he had given in the July 24 deposition, when he 
said that Altman had informed the White House that the RTC could not finish its 
investigation of the failed Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan -- which was owned 
by a one-time business partner of the President and First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton -- before a deadline for the filing of civil complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that's my testimony, then I stand by it," he said repeatedly as Sen. 
Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), the committee's ranking minority member, read 
excerpts from the deposition and demanded to know whether they were true or 
false. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Clintons were mentioned as possible witnesses in the RTC 
investigation, relaying any information about its status to the White House 
would have constituted a serious breach of RTC confidentiality rules. As it 
happened, Congress subsequently extended the Feb. 28 deadline until the end of 
1995, making the issue moot. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman, who was serving as acting RTC chief at the time, testified about the 
meeting before the Senate panel on Feb. 24 and denied imparting any 
confidential information. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony earlier Thursday, other White House officials who took part in 
the Feb. 2 meeting all strenuously denied that Altman had discussed the status 
of the Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Their accounts, however, appeared to conflict with what Ickes told the 
committee in his deposition -- a discrepancy that Republican senators cited as 
they argued that both Altman and the White House had not told the truth about 
what transpired at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 At hearings during the last week, the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs 
Committee and the Senate panel have been examining the propriety of the meeting 
and some 40 other discussions between White House and Treasury Department 
officials during a six-month period ending in late February of this year as the 
RTC worked to complete its investigation of Madison Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Feb. 2 meeting, which Ickes attended with then-White House Counsel Bernard 
Nussbaum and other senior White House officials, has been the subject of 
particular scrutiny because of the discrepancies that have emerged between 
Altman's and Ickes' recollections of what was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ickes sought to reconcile those conflicts Thursday by arguing that GOP 
senators had misconstrued the remarks he made in his deposition. He said he 
neither asked for nor received any information from Altman that was "secret or 
confidential." 
</P>
<P>
 He also complained that he was denied the opportunity to consult his notes of 
the meeting before answering questions about it at his deposition and said he 
had only conveyed his "impression" of what Altman had said and could not recall 
his "exact words." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he is "completely deaf" in his right ear and was not sitting 
close enough to Altman to be certain that he clearly heard everything that was 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly disturbed, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) noted that the discrepancies 
between the participants' accounts of the meeting "go to the core of whether 
something improper may have happened" in any of the White House-Treasury 
meetings. "If your earlier testimony is true, then there is a serious question 
about the transfer of information to the President and the First Lady," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is that I've testified to the best of my memory," Ickes 
replied. "I do not recall what people said exactly, but that was the gist." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Whitewater hearings neared their conclusion, Ickes testimony appeared 
to deepen the difficulties faced by Altman, who has been accused by senators 
from both parties of giving them misleading testimony when he appeared before 
the Senate committee earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Relying in part on Ickes' deposition, Republicans have charged that Altman not 
only lied to Congress about what occurred at the meeting but that he improperly 
conveyed to the White House confidential information about the status of the 
RTC inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Those difficulties multiplied on Thursday, the next to last day of the 
hearings, when several other White House aides testified that they "regretted" 
Altman's failure to tell the whole truth about the Feb. 2 meeting when he was 
first asked about Whitewater meetings by the Senate committee on Feb. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 The aides said they realized almost immediately that Altman had made serious 
omissions when he testified about the meeting in February -- neglecting, among 
other things, to inform the senators that he also had discussed the question of 
disqualifying himself from overseeing the Madison Guaranty case but had run 
into opposition from Nussbaum and the other officials present. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing before the panel late in the evening, Nussbaum also ran into fierce 
criticism from both Democrats and Republicans over the "recusal" issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe you had any right whatsoever to interject yourself in Roger 
Altman's decision to recuse himself," said Committee Chairman Sen. Donald W. 
Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.). "You had no right. . . . You crossed the line in a case 
involving the President." 
</P>
<P>
 In long hours of testimony during the last week, virtually every other White 
House official who attended the Feb. 2 meeting denied, in nearly identical 
accounts, that Altman did anything more than give them the same "procedural 
briefing" that he already had given to members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about Ickes' deposition, they all said that he was "mistaken" and 
suggested that the Ickes would clarify what he had meant to say when he 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Ickes sat grim-faced before the panel, responding to questions about 
his conflicting testimony, it became apparent that the discrepancies between 
various officials' recollections of events were only growing. 
</P>
<P>
 With many of those discrepancies centering around Altman's conduct, Democrats 
and Republicans pressed Ickes and five other presidential aides who testified 
Thursday to explain why the White House failed to correct Altman's Feb. 24 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the questioning centered on why Altman failed to mention that he had 
announced his intention to disqualify himself from overseeing the Madison 
Guaranty case at the Feb. 2 meeting. Altman raised the issue at the end of the 
meeting, but agreed to reconsider after Nussbaum questioned whether it was 
necessary. He finally recused himself formally from the case on Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials have admitted that they realized almost immediately that 
Altman had made serious omissions when he testified about the Feb. 2 meeting at 
the earlier Senate hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 John Podesta, the Administration aide who was charged with seeing that Altman 
correct the testimony, testified that the White House was "very concerned" 
about the omissions and had asked Altman to promptly amplify the record. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But in three belated attempts to clarify his testimony with letters to the 
committee, Altman never mentioned the issue of recusal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me the ball was dropped," Sen. Richard H. Bryan (D-Nev.) told 
Podesta. "Short of hitting somebody between the eyes with a 2-by-4, I don't 
know how much more clearly it could have been imparted . . . that there (was) a 
problem with the testimony." 
</P>
<P>
 In the House, where Whitewater hearings also continued, Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen defended Altman against mounting GOP demands for his resignation. 
Both he and the President still have confidence in Altman, Bentsen added. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans refused to give up, however, as Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) 
told Bentsen that Altman ought to be forced to step down for "tailoring the 
truth" in his testimony to Congress. KCET to Preempt Shows for Hearings 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitewater hearings will be broadcast live today on KCET-TV, Channel 28, 
beginning at 6:30 a.m. The station made its decision to preempt regularly 
scheduled programming after the deadline for printing the TV listings that 
appear in Calendar.

DODGER FANS TRY NOT TO GET TOO BLUE OVER STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS RICCARDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Meaghers, fearful that this was the end, came to Dodger Stadium on 
Thursday from Fresno. Sister Teresa Anne and Sister Bertilla, sensing that this 
might be their last chance to see their beloved boys in blue, came weeks before 
Nuns Night. And 71-year-old Betty Zaby, a fan since the Dodgers moved to Los 
Angeles, came to savor every last minute of a season that could be cut short. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the end of the world," said Zaby, as she headed to her field level 
box seat to watch the Dodgers battle the San Diego Padres in the final game of 
the current home stand -- and what some feared might be the last game of the 
1994 season at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 With the players union threatening to strike next Friday, labor troubles cast 
a pall over the afternoon game. 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't much sympathy for either side of the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who do you root for? Million-dollar owners or million-dollar players?" asked 
Steve Spalsbury, 33, who drove with his 8-year-old son Marc from San Diego to 
watch the game. "It's like, Beavis or Butt-head?" 
</P>
<P>
 Flanked in his sales booth by Dodger T-shirts, buttons and banners, 
concessionaire Dennis Hussey was not very pleased with his hometown team. "I 
don't have any money coming from anywhere else," he said, "and it's nice that 
they want a million dollars, but they should realize there are lots of people 
who depend on them." Hussey and most other vendors and stadium employees would 
be out of work during a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 One stadium hand said he will miss the work more than the money. "It is so 
much fun out here," said John W. Thompson, who has run elevators at Dodger 
Stadium for 18 years but also works as a mechanic for the Los Angeles Police 
Department. "This is the most beautiful park in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, 54, remembers sitting idle during the 1981 strike, which ran 49 
days. "I hated it," he said. But he is trying to remain philosophical: "This is 
a part of life, and there's nothing you can do about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of a strike has been looming all season because the players 
and owners are operating without a contract. Both groups agreed to start the 
season while a new contract was being worked on. However, the sides are 
polarized on the issues of a proposed salary cap and arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 The players union explored the idea with its players of going on strike after 
Thursday's game but chose to keep the previously announced Aug. 12 strike date. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil LaBarre said his family dreaded the thought of a strike, in part because 
his children are on a mission to collect Dodger autographs. Before the game, 
which the Dodgers won 1-0 before 45,000 fans, Shawn, 10, and Ashley, 7, snagged 
batting coach Manny Mota. He added his signatures to baseballs bearing the 
autographs of Raul Mondesi, Tommy Lasorda and Brett Butler, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids are suffering more than anyone," LaBarre said. "When you come to a 
game and see it in person, talk to the players . . . win or lose, my kids are 
still happy to go to a game. And we're not going to get that now." 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger baseball has been the game of choice in the Meagher household for 
generations. Cindy and Vince Meagher and their 12-year-old son Doug are making 
a tour of Southern California ballparks to get in as much live baseball as 
possible before a strike hits. Thursday they were at Dodger Stadium; Friday 
they'll be in Anaheim to watch the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be bored the rest of the summer," said Doug, a catcher in a 
Fresno Little League. 
</P>
<P>
 In the upper deck, two nuns were waiting for the game to start, Dodger visors 
in place on their wimples, blue trim bedecking their white habits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made sure to get this ticket," said Sister Teresa Anne of Nazareth House on 
the Westside. She hopes that the Dodgers will win it all this year -- "for all 
the praying we've been doing, they should." 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Teresa and fellow convent member Sister Bertilla bemoaned the 
possibility of a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes away from the sportsmanship," Sister Teresa said. "It loses the 
season for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Some fans said they could live with a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be good for all the first place teams, because they'll go straight to 
the playoffs," said Johnny Vorburger, 10, as he sat with other youths from a 
Santa Monica day camp. Conveniently, the Dodgers are first in the National 
League West. 
</P>
<P>
 Would a guaranteed first place finish really be worth a strike? "Nah, I'd like 
to see the whole season," Johnny said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in his left field box seat wearing a Dodger jersey, Pete Ortiz was 
drinking up the atmosphere. The Riverside County sheriff's deputy made a point 
of picking up tickets for this game, knowing that the season's days may be 
numbered. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the end of baseball won't be the end of the world. "I'm a big 
Dodger fan, driving here for two hours," said Ortiz, 28. "But you just have to 
roll with it. I love baseball, but there's a lot more important things in life 
I can get upset over." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, baseball fans protested the threatened strike. 
</P>
<P>
 In Arlington, Tex., about 500 fans left their seats in the top of the third 
inning of the game between the Chicago White Sox and Texas Rangers. But most 
who left their seats after the first pitch of the third inning returned for the 
bottom of the inning. Few fans left the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kansas City, two young men at the Royals-Oakland A's game drew applause 
when they carried a big sign that read: "Fans Say One More Strike & We're Out!" 
</P>
<P>
 * NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE: Players decide against striking before Aug. 12. C1

DENVER AIRPORT TO BYPASS BALKY BAGGAGE MOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS SAHAGUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Desperate to get its 21st-Century airport open after four failed tries and 
unwilling to wait for the bugs to be worked out of its high-tech baggage 
handling system, the city is gambling on a new backup hauler: the old-fashioned 
kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Wellington Webb announced Thursday that the city intends to build an 
alternative system to get the $3.7-billion airfield up and running by early 
next year while engineers try to fix its $193-million network of computers, 
lasers and underground high-speed tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The "new" system -- a network of conveyor belts, carts and tugs found at most 
of the nation's existing airports -- is projected to cost as much as $50 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The tab would be covered under an estimated $200-million bond issue that 
Denver intends to sell this month. That would also cover $33 million a month in 
interest on revenue bonds, maintenance and operating costs that the city has 
been paying on Denver International Airport since January. 
</P>
<P>
 But a bullish Webb, who some critics say is anxious to open the airport before 
his reelection campaign begins, stopped short of announcing a firm target date 
to launch DIA, undoubtedly wary after previous airport openings were scrubbed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot afford to wait any longer," Webb said of the airport that has 
remained closed for 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot continue any longer than absolutely necessary to have a $3-billion 
airport sitting virtually complete but still unusable," he said. "An alternate 
system is required and will be built." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest opening date of May 15 was bagged after video footage aired 
nationwide showed the sophisticated system flinging bags and their contents 
willy-nilly -- unable to deliver a single bag to its destination during 
repeated tests. Those images prompted wags across the country to dub DIA 
"Denver Imaginary Airport" and "Doesn't Include Airplanes," among various 
unflattering names. 
</P>
<P>
 That same month, Webb overslept and missed a 4:45 a.m. appointment with ABC's 
"Good Morning America" while on a campaign to stifle controversy swirling 
around the new airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Given these and other public-relations black eyes, it remains to be seen 
whether there will be buyers for new Denver airport bonds. The city's rating 
was lowered to a notch above "junk" status by at least one New York bond house 
after the May 15 date fizzled. 
</P>
<P>
 But an even bigger problem for Webb and the airport may loom if United 
Airlines, DIA's biggest tenant, refuses to go along with construction of the 
backup system. 
</P>
<P>
 United, which insisted on the ambitious computerized hauler in the first place 
to ensure quick turnarounds of its planes in Denver, reportedly is worried that 
the alternative system will be too slow and result in costly delays. 
</P>
<P>
 "United has indicated they're not comfortable with our approach," Webb said. 
"In that regard, I have written to United chairman of the board Gerald 
Greenwald to let him know that my door remains open. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would value any input that would help us improve the alternate system, and 
will continue to extend an invitation to United to work with us over the next 
30 days to identify any improvements we can make to our plan." 
</P>
<P>
 In a terse response, Stephen Steers, senior vice president of customer service 
for United Airlines, said: "We are not rejecting the proposal out of hand, but 
simply need more time to review all alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have $300 million invested (in the new airport) and we want to see some 
return on it," Steers said. "We can't open with a baggage system that was 
hastily conceived and may not meet the needs of our customers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, Steers complained that city officials did not inform United about 
its alternative plan until Monday, and only gave the carrier an hour to review 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if United plans to take its arguments to court, Steers said, "We want to 
reserve rights to all our options." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, United officials expressed concerns that a conventional backup system 
could more than double the 25-minute turnaround time the airline needs to 
operate profitably here. United plans to have 284 flights a day out of DIA and 
can ill afford delays. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers say an advantage to remaining at Stapleton International 
Airport until DIA's automated network is fully functional -- a feat that some 
engineers believe could take up to two years to accomplish -- is that United 
would not be paying additional operating costs at DIA at a time when its 
employees have taken over ownership and a new board of directors is trying to 
boost ridership and earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental Airlines, which has signed a lease to operate the 20 gates on 
DIA's Concourse A for five years, decided a week ago to cut back its operation 
in Denver to 23 flights a day beginning Nov. 1 as part of an ongoing plan to 
increase profitability. At one time, that airline originated 200 flights a day 
from Stapleton. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to avert further delays that threaten the city's financial well-being, 
Webb opted to build the stand-in baggage system, which is expected to perform 
at least as well as Stapleton's. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, which must be ratified by the Denver City Council, was 
recommended on Tuesday by a consulting firm, Logplan of Frankfurt, Germany. 
Logplan based its conclusion on information provided by the company that 
designed the computerized system, BAE Automated Systems Inc. of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as two weeks ago, BAE officials promised the city that its 
computerized baggage system will be completed, tested and ready for operation 
by Oct. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb was not impressed. "Based on past experience," he said, "we don't believe 
that date will be any better than the last ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Disregarding United's misgivings, the city plans to give the job of building 
the makeshift luggage-mover to Rapistan Demag Corp. of Grand Rapids, Mich., a 
subsidiary of the German industrial and telecommunications giant Mannesmann AG. 
</P>
<P>
 Rapistan already has provided the city with a detailed schedule of a proposed 
system that it believes could be on line by February at the latest, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The makeshift system will require major changes and building modifications at 
the new airport. Transformers must be installed to power the conveyor belts. 
Sorting and distributing of luggage and other cargo, which is expected to be 
handled on a floor of the passenger parking garage, must comply with Federal 
Aviation Administration regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, it remains to be seen how well the new airport debt will sell on 
the bond market. As it stands, the new airport has a BB rating, the lowest 
investment-grade rating with Standard & Poor's, the nation's leading 
bond-rating agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Perez, director of Standard & Poor's municipal transportation group, 
said the new bonds will be rated BB as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless there is something really dramatic that I don't know right now, we 
won't revisit the rating," Perez said. "It's low enough now to incorporate that 
risk." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Denver's voters approved what was promised would be a 120-gate, 
$1.7-billion facility that would give the then-depressed economy a boost and 
generate revenue and jobs for 100 years -- all this without spending city tax 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials -- including the airport's original guiding force, ex-mayor Federico 
Pena, now the U.S. transportation secretary -- said that the new airport was 
needed because there was no room to expand Stapleton, a facility punished by 
winter flight delays that back up air traffic across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What residents got is an 88-gate, $3.7-billion airport with five all-weather 
runways, 15,000 covered parking spots for automobiles, computer-operated subway 
trains and a glitch-plagued baggage handling system. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing worse than not opening Denver International Airport and paying 
$33 million a month in delay costs," Webb said, "is opening DIA and then having 
to shut it down because the baggage system does not work." 
</P>

COLUMN ONE; SWAYING VOTERS WITH THEIR LOOKS; THE RIGHT SUITS OR COIFS CAN HELP 
CANDIDATES. A BAD HAIR DAY CAN BE USED AS AN EFFECTIVE WEAPON BY ONE'S 
OPPONENT.

<P>
 There's no denying it: Dianne Feinstein looks awful. The unflattering portrait 
of the senator, featured prominently in her opponent's television 
advertisements, captures the 61-year-old Democrat in partial profile -- her 
jowls puffy, her expression at once dour and dowdy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's stupid," said Bill Carrick, Feinstein's media consultant. "People know 
that picture is not how she really looks." 
</P>
<P>
 But Larry McCarthy, who chose the shot for ads he created for Republican Rep. 
Mike Huffington, has been using the image for years -- ever since the 1990 
governor's race, when he produced ads for Pete Wilson, Feinstein's opponent in 
that election. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as now, McCarthy said, "It's not our job to make her look good." 
</P>
<P>
 It may sound superficial, trivial or even cynical, but campaign veterans 
acknowledge one of the fundamental axioms of politics: Looks matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Do well-fitted suits and stylish coifs win elections? Not by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 But especially in a state as large as California, where televised images are 
as close as many voters get to candidates, physical appearance -- including 
posture, gestures and wardrobe -- can make a difference on Election Day. Or to 
put it another way: One homely photo of your opponent can be worth 1,000 words. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voters' impressions of a candidate are based on a lot of bits of information 
that are perceived visually," said Darry Sragow, who managed Insurance 
Commissioner John Garamendi's failed primary campaign for governor. "I don't 
want to put ideas in anybody's head, but if you had a picture of your opponent 
as a flower child looking hippie-ish, that could be very powerful." 
</P>
<P>
 Sragow and other political consultants agree that pictures have a stronger 
impact if they reinforce other campaign themes. So between now and November, 
observers said, voters can expect to see Democratic gubernatorial nominee 
Kathleen Brown looking mature and confident (in her ads) and girlish and 
inexperienced (in the ads of her opponent, Wilson). The incumbent governor will 
look either capable or curmudgeonly, depending on the source. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to avoid the cheap shot . . . but still give people a glimpse into 
the true Pete Wilson," said Jim Stearns, creative director at Clinton Reilly 
Communications, where Brown's ads and mailers are being produced. Culling 
through hundreds of photos available from archival agencies and other sources, 
Stearns says he has sought images in which Wilson looks beleaguered, 
ineffective and overwhelmed by the task of governing. 
</P>
<P>
 A favorite shot, featured in one recent Brown ad, shows Wilson resting his 
head on one hand. "It's a classic," Stearns said. "There are some sympathetic 
qualities, but in a certain context he looks tired and exasperated. He's 
looking out at the viewer and saying: 'Couldn't you help me?' -- instead of 
helping them." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schnur, Wilson's campaign spokesman, downplays how much time and effort 
his camp has invested in finding a similarly evocative photo of Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point we'll just start using a picture of Jerry and drawing in the 
hair," he joked, referring to Brown's brother, former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) 
Brown Jr. "But for our purposes, letting people know that she's against the 
death penalty and doesn't think illegal immigration is a problem is a lot 
scarier than any picture we could find." 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a benchmark by which political consultants measure the power of 
physiognomy, it is the 1960 televised presidential debate between Sen. John F. 
Kennedy and Vice President Richard Nixon. Kennedy appeared tan, relaxed and 
confident. Nixon, who had a 5 o'clock shadow and sweated profusely under hot 
lights, appeared shifty and nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 Drop-dead gorgeousness does not necessarily win elections either. In fact, 
research conducted by Shawn Rosenberg, a professor in UC Irvine's department of 
political psychology, found that when voters were asked to rate photographs of 
real and fake candidates, the very beautiful or handsome entries garnered fewer 
votes than the average-looking ones. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg found certain physical characteristics weighed heavily on voters' 
minds. Bangs, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the case of women (candidates), if they had bangs it seemed to severely 
decrease the perception that they were competent and trustworthy," Rosenberg 
said. Men did better without mustaches. Flat cheekbones were seen as more 
politically desirable than high ones, and round faces attracted more votes than 
oblong ones. And generally the older a candidate was, the better. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg is fully aware that "being honest and competent is very different 
than appearing honest and competent." But his experiments indicate that a lot 
of people do not readily grasp the distinction. 
</P>
<P>
 With a little image-crafting -- makeup, hairstyling and adjusted camera angles 
-- Rosenberg found that he could improve his experimental candidates' ratings 
as much as five percentage points. The addition of simple jewelry to a female 
candidate was also found to boost her appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the same issues, the same party, more people were willing to vote for 
them" after such polishing, said Rosenberg, who not surprisingly has received 
offers to consult on real campaigns. He said he has turned them down, 
preferring to devote his time to scholarly study. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg's research did not test the impact of race on voters' perceptions -- 
he used only non-Latino white models. But to the extent that photos can be used 
to play on stereotypes, minority candidates may be vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU once accused Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana of having 
"appealed to racial sentiments" when he used a photograph of Yvonne Brathwaite 
Burke on a 1980 campaign mailer. Burke, who is black and had been appointed to 
represent a predominantly white district, was defeated by Dana, who is white. 
Dana's campaign claimed that it would have used a portrait of Burke no matter 
what race she was. 
</P>
<P>
 Clothing can help make the most of a candidate's natural attributes -- and in 
this arena, there are some obvious rules. Among them: No tank tops. "Not very 
many people get elected who wear tank tops," Carrick said. Another no-no: 
artificial fibers. "You don't want to come across as too polyester," veteran 
political adviser Joe Cerrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, a political wardrobe should not steal attention from the 
candidate. But some have bucked this idea, turning an idiosyncrasy into a 
trademark. Consider S.I. Hayakawa, the late U.S. senator, and his 
tam-o'-shanter. Or Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) and his bow ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Anderson, executive director of the Neckwear Assn. of America, recalls 
that during the 1976 presidential campaign, Jimmy Carter raised eyebrows by 
often donning a "lucky" burgundy polka-dotted tie. Though he was up against 
tamer cravats, Carter prevailed. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 When it comes to hue, female candidates have an advantage. Although fashion 
dictates that their male counterparts dress almost exclusively in dark blues 
and sober grays, women are freer to roam the spectrum -- sporting reds, greens 
and purples that shine on camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a time when men as a group politically are going to be viewed as Old Guard 
and boring anyway, this reinforces it," said Sragow, who is running the 
reelection campaign of Rep. Rick H. Lehman (D-North Fork). Men must face facts, 
he said: For them "to wear a red or green suit is to be viewed as an agent of 
change that voters would not find acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 This sometimes sparks a phenomenon that Carrick calls "color envy," and he 
offers a favorite example from California's 1990 gubernatorial race. Carrick 
claims that before one televised debate, Wilson -- then a U.S. senator -- 
worried aloud about how his wardrobe would compare to Feinstein's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wilson said, . . . 'Here's my problem: I'm going to walk on the stage and I'm 
going to be in my gray suit and she's going to wear a red suit and I'm going to 
look like I'm not even here,' " Carrick recalled. "He just blurted it out in a 
bout of color envy." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson shouldn't have worried, according to Michael Sheehan, a 
Washington-based media consultant and communication trainer who often coaches 
candidates for the Democratic National Committee. Barring outlandish costumes, 
he said, a politician's outfit is far less important than physical bearing. 
Whether captured in photos or on videotape, he said, good posture and 
non-threatening gestures are key to making a winning impression. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Dick Nixon death-grip-on-the-podium (makes a candidate) look tense," 
Sheehan said, ticking off a few basic tips. "And arms crossed against the chest 
implies impatience." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheehan also advises candidates never to shout, no matter how large an 
audience they face. ("You'll look like you've had one too many cups of double 
espresso.") And for would-be leaders who tend to gesticulate, he recommends 
rounded gestures instead of sharp, accusatory motions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voters need to get a sense of confidence in the individual -- 'Can I trust 
this person to make the right decision for me?' " he said. "And I don't think 
you trust the person who's poking you in the chest with their index finger." 
</P>
<P>
 Although most top campaign managers acknowledge that appearance matters, none 
admit to hiring beauty professionals to perform miracle make-overs. "This isn't 
'Oprah,' " scoffs one campaign adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it comes to selecting photographs, that's another story. 
</P>
<P>
 So will Feinstein retaliate against Huffington, matching his hideous photo of 
her with one of him that is equally unbecoming? Kam Kuwata, Feinstein's 
campaign manager, admits to fantasizing about revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ideal picture I would use is one of him in a 10-gallon hat with a 
(expletive)-eating grin on his face," Kuwata said, referring to a recent photo 
that appeared in The Times. In Kuwata's view: "It portrays him as an outsider, 
not a Californian. The grin says he's more interested in himself than who you 
are." 
</P>
<P>
 That shot, Kuwata said, would be even more effective than "one where he had 
food falling out of his mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 But Carrick, Feinstein's media consultant, says he prefers to play it 
straighter. So far, the only photo he has used of Huffington depicts him in 
shirt and tie, gazing into space. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the dour-faced shot of Feinstein: "The voters get turned off when you 
find some . . . picture that they know is not representative," Carrick said, 
predicting that Huffington's ads could backfire. "People are cynical. They say, 
'Yeah, we know what's going on here.' " The Eye of the Beholder 
</P>
<P>
 Looks matter on Election Day. But not everyone agrees on what turns voters on 
and off. Many politicians portray their opponents in profile so here is no eye 
contact with voters. But in state Treasurer Kathleen Brown's ads, Gov. Pete 
Wlson stares right into the camera. "We want people to look in his eyes," says 
one Brown aide. "What do you see?... A guy who talks tough and doesn't 
deliver." 
</P>
<P>
 As the incumbent, Wilson stresses his leadership experience by soberly facing 
the camera.... Brown seeks to portray a beleaguered Wilson, leaning on his hand 
for support. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to appear strong, capable and caring, Brown's eyes greet the camera 
and her smile is friendly.... Wilson captures her in profile, her lips frozen 
in an accusatory pose. Is she dogged? Or just defensive? 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein uses a photo that shows confidence and warmth.... Rep. 
Mike Huffington portrays her as puffy-cheeked and grim, more a grumpy matron 
than a U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, in an open-collared shirt and light jacket, seeks to resemble the 
common man.... Feinstein shows a more formal Huffington. And what exactly, is 
he squinting at?

CHOLERA WANES AS TENSIONS RISE IN ZAIRE CAMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The existence that passes as living for the 1 million Rwandan refugees in this 
country grew better Thursday, and, of course, worse -- and all the while more 
tangled and troubling. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the rising tide of cholera, which killed so many thousands, was 
declared medically contained. The squalid camps spread north and south of here 
even began to show the faint sparks of vigor. But with vigor has come new 
tensions, killing and the threat of spreading political discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cholera epidemic is over," said Panos Moumtsis, spokesman for the Office 
of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. "The curve of death, as we call it, 
is going down." 
</P>
<P>
 By that, the agency said it was expressing the consensus of the many relief 
groups assisting here on the Rwandan border. But only by the abstract medical 
definition is the epidemic anywhere near over. 
</P>
<P>
 The brutal, humiliating death of uncontrollable diarrhea and dehydration still 
claimed perhaps 700 lives Thursday. It will take 700 more lives today, hundreds 
more tomorrow and the next day -- and for days to come. 
</P>
<P>
 But because improvements in the flow of supplies and clean water have led to a 
reduction in the number of deaths from a daily high of 1,800 to 2,000 a week 
ago, and since the number of new cases reported is also declining, the 
technical conditions of epidemic have passed. The U.N. refugee agency said, 
however, that deaths from dysentery were mounting each day, with uncertain 
prospects for control. 
</P>
<P>
 If the surviving refugees could take some solace from their misery as they 
rested and fed themselves on the increasing amounts of relief food, they faced 
renewed fears: their own vulnerability to the defeated army that led them out 
of Rwanda and to the robber instincts of the underpaid soldiers from Zaire who 
have greeted them here. "Security is getting worse and tensions are building up 
fast," Moumtsis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Refugees on Thursday pounced on a Zairian guard outside the outlying camp 
called Katale and hacked him to death with machetes. Intervention by U.N. 
refugee officials prevented a swift retaliatory attack by other Zairian 
soldiers. But alarm spread through the refugee ranks -- in some places 
automobiles stopped in the middle of the road and blocked traffic so the driver 
could shout out news of the killing and warn of the danger of reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief officials said refugees had suffered repeated robberies and extortion 
by Zairian soldiers. In this case, the checkpoint sentry reportedly demanded 
money from a Rwandan refugee who tried to drive into the camp in his car, 
bearing Rwandan plates. Refugees with cars, radios and other possessions are 
presumed to be people of means and quick targets for soldiers, who are paid 
virtually nothing in Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All over Goma, Zairian soldiers could be seen driving confiscated vehicles. 
Armed soldiers were seen stopping cars and trucks with Rwandan plates. 
Independent relief workers and journalists also have reported extortion by 
soldiers in Zairian uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Local authorities said they would attempt to investigate the attack but more 
pressing was the Zairian commander's demand for the return of the slain 
soldier's rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions also are mounting between Goma's civilians and the refugees. The huge 
influx here has driven up the cost of living to Klondike standards. A 50-cent 
bottle of beer now costs $8, a $25 bag of sugar is more than $60. Local farmers 
say Rwandans are ravaging their banana plantations and vegetable crops. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers on Thursday demanded that Zairian authorities take firmer control of 
refugees, and at least one camp was ordered evacuated and relocated farther 
from town. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, what sounded to be nearby, intermittent automatic rifle fire was 
heard from the direction of the refugee camp where former members of the 
Rwandan army are segregated, supposedly separate from the general refugee 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief officials said the weaponry display demonstrated that attempts to 
disarm the defeated, bitter soldiers had been unsuccessful. It also showed 
civilian refugees that their old army was not entirely toothless, as it 
continued to demand that Rwandans not return home. 
</P>
<P>
 Augustin Rusanganwa, a former official in the defeated Rwandan government, 
said the goal was to keep refugees in camps in the hope -- no matter how vague 
and grasping -- that their tragedy would so alarm the world that global 
intervention in Rwanda would be inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The international community has to bring about negotiations," he said. "The 
war in Rwanda was not a political war, but a tribal war. What I don't 
understand and what many refugees don't understand is how the West, how the 
U.S.A., can accept a minority group taking over the country. That's not 
democracy at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The defeated government, its army and nearly all the refugees here are Hutus, 
who recently accounted for 85% of Rwanda's population. The Rwandan Patriotic 
Front, which won the war, is predominantly Tutsi.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; BROWN SUPPORTS PROGRAM AGAINST DOMESTIC 
VIOLENCE; SHE CRITICIZES WILSON'S RECORD ON THE ISSUE. HIS SPOKESMAN SAYS HE 
OPENED SEVEN WOMEN'S SHELTERS AND APPROPRIATED $30 MILLION FOR THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown on Thursday endorsed a 
comprehensive program against domestic violence, which she described as a 
deadly problem that threatens to tear apart the fabric of society. 
</P>
<P>
 "Domestic violence is a crime against our most cherished institution, our 
family," Brown said during a campaign appearance at the Daybreak Women's 
Shelter in Santa Monica along with state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), 
Assemblywoman Barbara Friedman (D-North Hollywood) and Los Angeles City Atty. 
James Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must not continue to accept domestic violence as an unpleasant part of 
modern society," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the state treasurer, endorsed legislation being sponsored by Watson and 
Friedman to require training in domestic violence for both police and judges 
and creation of emergency response teams to provide victims with psychological, 
medical, financial and legal help. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said it was unfortunate that it took the "tragedy" of the O.J. Simpson 
case to focus national attention on the problem, but predicted that the 
campaign against domestic violence would gather momentum much as the campaign 
of Mothers Against Drunk Driving did against drunken driving in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "MADD did much more than change the law," Brown said. "They changed society's 
attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and the legislators criticized the record of Republican Gov. Pete 
Wilson, Brown's Nov. 8 election foe, on the issue, saying that California has 
more dog shelters than shelters for victims of domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 They did credit Wilson with approving a $30-million appropriation for new 
shelters in the new state budget, but noted that it came only after the Simpson 
case focused public attention on the problem in an election year. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Wilson campaign spokesman Dan Schnur said Wilson had not created 
any dog shelters during his first term, but had opened seven shelters for 
battered women and increased the annual appropriation for them from $2.8 
million to $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur cited other actions and said, "Pete Wilson cared about and worked on 
this issue long before it was politically popular. And he's been in the 
trenches fighting to make the fundamental changes we need so that women are 
safe in the streets and in their homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur noted that Brown had made no mention of domestic violence in the 
33-point anti-crime program she proposed last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 In her remarks, Brown said that domestic violence resulted in the murders of 
253 women in California last year.  
</P>
<P>
 "If we do not do something for the family of California, to intervene and 
break this cycle of domestic violence, we will never be able to build enough 
prisons for the children who become the next generation of batterers and the 
women who become the next generation of victims in this horrendous cycle of 
violence," she said.

EL TORO BASE LAND SWAP CONSIDERED; CONVERSION: IRVINE CO. AND U.S. ARE 
DISCUSSING AN EXCHANGE OF BASE PROPERTY FOR ACREAGE NEAR CLEVELAND NATIONAL 
FOREST. PLAN WOULD GIVE DEVELOPMENT GIANT CONTROL OF ALL OR PART OF AIR STATION 
PROPERTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON and GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. and the U.S. Department of Interior are discussing a possible 
land swap in which the development giant could gain control of all or part of 
El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in exchange for property bordering the 
Cleveland National Forest, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials were in Orange County last week meeting with Irvine Co. 
executives about the proposal for future control of the 4,700-acre military 
base, scheduled to close in 1999, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The likelihood of such an enormous swap is unclear, officials said, and no one 
was sure whether it would boost or hinder prospects for a commercial airport at 
El Toro. But it seems certain to put the county's largest landowner in the 
center of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Supervisor William G. Steiner said Thursday he was notified of 
the talks this week and he seemed open to a further review of an exchange that 
could give the Irvine Co. ownership of base property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure there are some people who would be pleased that whole scenario could 
be placed back in the hands of the business community," Steiner said. "They may 
be able to cut their own deal. Certainly, we have had a good relationship with 
the Irvine Co., so this would not be uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Steiner said he is not ready to abandon the work of the El 
Toro Reuse Planning Authority, the intergovernmental agency created earlier 
this year to develop a plan for conversion of the base to civilian use. 
</P>
<P>
 The future of El Toro has been the most hotly debated and politically charged 
issue that Orange County officials have grappled with in years. Local business 
leaders are pushing a ballot initiative seeking public approval for an airport. 
The measure faces significant opposition from cities in the southern portion of 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder also said she had been informed of the Irvine 
Co. discussions and characterized the talks as "ongoing and conceptual." She 
agreed with Steiner that the work of the planning authority should continue. 
</P>
<P>
 An Irvine Co. official acknowledged Thursday that a possible land exchange 
between the company and the federal government has been "floating around for 
some time," but she described it as an idea, not yet tied to any specific 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had conversations with the Interior Department on a lot of things," 
said Monica Florian, a senior vice president of the company. "The topic of a 
potential exchange has been discussed. There's nothing formal. The only 
understanding that I have of the whole subject of the exchange is very 
preliminary and very general." 
</P>
<P>
 Florian said that although no specific acreage has been formally proposed, 
general discussions have centered on the concept of the federal government 
"exchanging some base land for some of our northern (Orange County) property" 
near the Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) whose district includes 
the base, said the congressman had not heard of the possibility of a land swap. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox has long favored putting the 4,700-acre base up for public bid without any 
preconditions on its use, allowing interested developers to propose conversion 
plans.  
</P>
<P>
 If the base is sold to a private development group, then under Cox's plan, the 
money could be used to offset the cost of moving the Marines from El Toro to 
the Miramar Naval Air Station in San Diego. The moving costs are expected to 
top more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Some government officials involved in the development of a base conversion 
plan for El Toro, however, question whether the Defense Department would be 
willing to give up the Marine base so the Interior Department can obtain some 
environmentally sensitive land with a potentially lower market value. 
</P>
<P>
 The same officials also wonder if this type of deal could meet the Defense 
Department's stated goal of generating revenue from base closures to offset the 
costs of moving personnel to other bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the Irvine Co. has been a big but quiet player in the divisive 
countywide debate over what to do with the base, although the company is the 
largest landowner in the county with significant holdings ringing the entire 
air station. 
</P>
<P>
 Already there is speculation swirling about how such an exchange, if carried 
out, could affect a push for a commercial airport on the site.  
</P>
<P>
 While local business executives supporting an airport are locked in a campaign 
to win passage of a countywide referendum in November, southern county 
officials have been adamantly opposed to such a plan, warning that an airport 
would bring added traffic and noise to their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the timing, officials said the land swap could make moot the 
issue in the November election since a ballot initiative cannot govern private 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, however, some officials believe that placing the Irvine Co. in 
control of El Toro could boost the fortunes of airport proponents.

WILSON OFFERS PLAN TO RETAIN WELFARE CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, hoping to preserve welfare cuts jeopardized by a recent 
court ruling, told federal officials Thursday that he plans to exempt disabled 
recipients and certain children from the reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to federal Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, 
Wilson said he believed the exemptions would "easily resolve" the court's 
problems with California's welfare cuts and remove the legal cloud that has 
hung over them since the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling last 
month invalidating the reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 California Health and Welfare Agency spokeswoman Shannon Bowman said the 
Wilson Administration has not yet determined how many recipients would be 
exempted or the cost to restore their benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the exemptions would apply to families with disabled adults and some 
of the so-called child-only cases -- those in which only the children in a 
family unit are receiving assistance from the Aid to Families With Dependent 
Children program. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, those two categories make up nearly a third of the 918,000 AFDC 
cases. Bowman cautioned, however, that not everyone in that group will be 
granted the exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's decision represents a major concession to the appellate court and it 
indicated that California may no longer be able to institute across-the-board 
welfare reductions as it has done for the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of welfare cuts on disabled adults and children was a key factor in 
the court's 2-1 decision, in which it found that the Bush Administration had 
violated federal law when it approved California's 1.3% AFDC benefit reduction 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The court faulted the Administration for failing to consider the impact the 
1992 cuts would have on the 2.7 million Californians who receive welfare, 
noting that it would put some segments of the welfare population at "increased 
risk of homelessness, inadequate nutrition and a variety of emotional and 
physical problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The state is required to seek federal authorization for such cuts because they 
bring California's welfare benefits below a federally established level. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Bush Administration not only granted the authorization but also gave the 
state approval for future cuts totaling 5%. The following year, 1993, the state 
cut benefits another 2.7%. This year, the governor and the Legislature approved 
a 2.3% reduction, effective Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In its ruling, the court did not specifically order benefits restored but left 
room for the state to reapply to the federal government for new authorization. 
The court made it clear, however, that the new application would have to comply 
with its findings and that the state would be required to show that the cuts 
would not harm recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has said repeatedly that welfare cuts serve as an incentive for 
recipients to go to work and improve conditions for their families. The court 
challenged that notion, saying it could not see how work incentives could 
benefit either disabled recipients or child-only cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said Thursday he expects to submit a new request for federal 
authorization within two weeks, and he urged Shalala to act quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Failure to review and approve the proposal promptly will increase the 
likelihood of additional challenges in state and federal courts," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 But advocates for the poor, who had filed the lawsuit challenging the cuts, 
predicted it would be many months before Shalala makes a final decision. They 
said Wilson has also asked the 9th Circuit Court for a rehearing, and they 
believe Shalala is not likely to respond until the court acts on that request. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis L. Child, an attorney for Legal Services of Northern California, said 
advocates for the poor plan in the meantime to ask the federal appellate court 
to delay implementation of the Sept. 1 welfare cuts. The cuts are expected to 
save the state about $5.6 million a month and are designed to help ease the 
state's budget crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Child said he will argue that since the latest cuts are based on an 
authorization that was invalidated by the court, they should not go into effect 
until the issue is finally resolved, either by Shalala granting a new 
authorization or a court ordering restoration of benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state shouldn't be allowed to proceed with further implementation of cuts 
that rely on an invalidated (authorization)," said Casey McKeever, an attorney 
for the Western Center on Law and Poverty Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 He said advocates for the poor intend in the near future to seek restoration 
of both the 1992 and 1993 benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, when welfare benefits in California reached their highest levels, 
the maximum cash grant for a typical family of three has dropped from $694 a 
month to $607. If the newest cuts go into effect on Sept. 1, benefits will drop 
to $593 a month. The reductions have been offset partially by increases in 
federal food stamps.

 Rep. Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) calls his plan "far more radical" than 
President George Bush's vision of a thousand points of light, and in the ad, he 
points to an audience of Republican supporters as the people who must solve the 
problems of poverty by spending more of their time and money to help the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate said he supports legislation to increase tax deductions for 
charitable giving. As a result, he says to the audience in the commercial: "It 
will mean you will have to stand up and take some of that money that you used 
to pay in federal taxes and give it to your church, give it to your charities, 
give it to the homeless shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can turn the country around," he continues. "We can get rid of the welfare 
state." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's commercial hits the airwaves in California just as the Senate 
race emerges from a bruising seven-week exchange of attack television 
commercials between the Republican and his opponent, Democratic Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent polls, the race continues to be close and, for Huffington, they 
indicate that he has spent so much of his campaign effort criticizing Feinstein 
that most California voters do not know much about him. The new commercial 
seeks to remedy that by providing Huffington's vision of government reform. 
</P>
<P>
 At 60 seconds, the ad is twice as long as most political commercials. 
Huffington, who is financing his campaign from a personal fortune, is estimated 
to have paid about $2 million to air the new ad statewide for about three 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile this week, both candidates continued to posture for the fall 
campaign by exchanging a series of debate challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein suggested in a letter to Huffington on Wednesday that the candidates 
hold three debates in the final six weeks of the race with at least two 
broadcast on television and one on radio. She listed media organizations in San 
Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego as possible hosts and she called on 
Huffington to designate a staff member to begin negotiations about the 
showdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington scoffed at negotiations, saying instead that Feinstein can talk to 
him directly if she wants to debate. He added that he was ready for the faceoff 
anytime and, provided an adequate audience, almost anywhere -- including, if 
she wanted, Thursday evening on the Capitol lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "You tell her, if she wants, I'll be there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Responded Feinstein: "There is a time for all things under the sun. There will 
be debates. Right now, we both have a very big responsibility. It's health care 
reform." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein and her campaign staff said Huffington's proposal for ending welfare 
was unrealistic and, they charged, it shows that his enormous personal wealth 
has left him out of touch with the needs of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's easy for a person like Congressman Huffington, who can buy 
anything he wants any time, to talk about charity," said Feinstein, who is also 
one of the Senate's wealthiest members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hazard a guess that I have spent far more time on skid rows and in 
soup kitchens than Congressman Huffington has," she said. "Some of it can be 
funded with charitable contributions, but a lot of it cannot be because the 
money is not forthcoming. I think it is wishful thinking and an obfuscation of 
fact." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said he has given substantial financial contributions to charity, 
but he acknowledges that he does not have a long background as a volunteer. He 
and his wife, Arianna, started helping at shelters last New Year's Day. Since 
then, he has encouraged his campaign staff to spend time at shelters near his 
Orange County headquarters. The candidate and his wife have also stopped at 
sites throughout the state while on the campaign trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has told reporters since last spring that volunteerism would be a 
theme in his campaign, but he has not focused on the idea until the commercial. 
It is a message that substantially overlaps the major theme of his wife's 
latest book, "The Fourth Instinct." 
</P>
<P>
 The book, Arianna Huffington's seventh, which was released in May, describes a 
spiritual revival under way in America that is essential to solve burgeoning 
social problems such as crime, poverty and inadequate education. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican nominee said in an interview Thursday that he agrees with his 
wife's conclusions in the book. He said he believes the nation is undergoing a 
historic transition that should include a heightened spiritual awareness and, 
as a result, a substantial increase in the amount of charitable giving. 
</P>
<P>
 Government's role, he said, is to reduce the need for welfare by improving the 
economy and creating jobs. "More than anything, real change will begin with a 
change in thinking -- not just better or smarter thinking, but rather a shift 
in who we think of as the problem solvers of society," Huffington said in a 
statement. "Instead of reflexively relying on the federal government to solve 
our problems, I believe we must strengthen and encourage civic institutions -- 
neighborhood associations, volunteer organizations, church and synagogue groups 
-- to reweave the fabric of community. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I am proposing is a far cry from President Bush's calls for a 'thousand 
points of light,' " he added. "I'm calling for something far more radical: the 
replacement of the welfare state with a renewed and revitalized civil society." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's ad profiles a volunteer at the Fred Jordan Mission in Downtown 
Los Angeles, Willie Jordan. Betty Reagan, an administrator at the mission, said 
Willie Jordan and the mission did not endorse Huffington as a candidate, but 
they were thankful for anyone seeking to help the poor. She said Huffington and 
his wife have volunteered at the mission. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of Huffington's plan say it is wishful thinking to believe that 
charitable contributions can accommodate the nation's poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Erlenbusch, executive director of the Los Angeles Coalition to End 
Homelessness, called the plan "simplistic" and worrisome because if government 
support is cut he believes the poor will suffer more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been doing this for 10 years, and under the Reagan Administration they 
said the same thing," he said. "Let's prove that capitalism works; let's prove 
that the private sector can pick it up. What's happened over the last 10 years 
is that homelessness has increased about 15% each year." 
</P>
<P>
 But Huffington got support from some Republican political consultants who said 
he could strike a chord in the public with a fresh-sounding message. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP strategist Sal Russo in Sacramento said "Californians are generous and 
considerate and caring people" who should respond to Huffington's call. Ron 
Smith, an adviser in Los Angeles, said people may be open to such unusual 
solutions because the old ways have not worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that Feinstein is going to say: 'I'm bringing home the 
bacon. This is for you. Vote for me,' " he added. "Huffington is going to say 
that I'm going to solve the problems through volunteerism and the alternative 
is more government, more spending and more taxes."

PIER GROUP; SIX SURFING LEGENDS INDUCTED INTO WALK OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although it shares a name with its more flamboyant Hollywood cousin, the 
inauguration of the Surfing Walk of Fame on Thursday was hardly a glitzy 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it was unapologetically down-home. About 80 people -- many of them 
wearing shorts and flip-flops -- hooted and howled as the inductees were 
announced. And the Walk of Famers did not sashay up to the microphone in 
designer attire flashing million-dollar smiles for the paparazzi.  
</P>
<P>
 This is Surf City, U.S.A., after all, not Tinseltown. And the honorees are 
legendary surfers, not a pack of caffe-latte-guzzling super-agents. 
</P>
<P>
 After speeches by local dignitaries, the names of six immortal surfers, etched 
on small granite stones, were placed on the Main Street sidewalk near the city 
pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Filmmaker Bruce Brown, whose 1964 movie about the quest for the perfect wave, 
"The Endless Summer," introduced surfing to the masses, downplayed the praise 
bestowed on him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really feel like I deserve this," said Brown, 56, garbed in a 
Hawaiian shirt, khaki trousers and running shoes. "I'm flattered. But it's kind 
of embarrassing. I'm more comfortable sitting at home talking to my friends." 
</P>
<P>
 What did he plan to do after the ceremony? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going home to surf," said Brown, whose "The Endless Summer II" was 
recently released. "With the movie now out, I'm trying to get into shape by 
surfing." 
</P>
<P>
 Master of ceremonies Peter Townend, a 1976 world surf champion from Australia 
who lives in Orange County, introduced the four living inductees: Joyce 
Hoffman, a five-time world champion; Robert August, one of the stars of "The 
Endless Summer"; Australian Mark Richards, a four-time world champion, and 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Two surfing pioneers were inducted posthumously, Tom Blake, a Santa Monica 
surfer who invented the surfboard fin in 1935, and Duke Kahanamoku, former 
Olympic swimmer and actor who was known as the "father of surfing." 
</P>
<P>
 "I never met Duke Kahanamoku," Townend said. "But I feel I'm a product of what 
he started way back in 1915 in Australia when he introduced the sport. To me 
it's an honor to talk about people like him." 
</P>
<P>
 Kahanamoku's place in the surfing pantheon is so universally accepted that he 
wasn't even voted on like the rest of those honored Thursday -- he was an 
automatic inductee. Born in Honolulu in 1890, the Duke, as he was known, became 
an inspiration to surfers of all ages. He helped start the first surf club in 
Oahu in 1907, and was voted sheriff of Honolulu 13 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Beside his contributions to surfing, Kahanamoku also won five Olympic swimming 
medals and had a stint in Hollywood with small parts in several films, 
including the 1948 "Wake of the Red Witch," starring John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kahanamoku died in 1968 of a heart attack, his funeral was the biggest 
Hawaii had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 For Hoffman, 47, of San Juan Capistrano, it was a day of pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to know that after 30 years, people remember you as giving 
something to surfing," said Hoffman, who was accompanied by her daughter, 
Samantha, 18. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman is regarded by some as the best female surfing competitor ever. In 
1965, she was named Los Angeles Times Woman of the Year, the only surfer to 
ever win the honor. In the 1960s, she was unbeatable and won five U.S. 
championships and five world championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Samantha recalled hearing a tale about her mother's competitive spirit on a 
trip home from a Santa Cruz contest with rival Jericho Poppler. "Poppler won," 
Samantha said, "and on the long drive home, my mother never said a word to 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 Those outside of surfing may not have heard of Tom Blake. Blake died May 5, 
1994, in Ashland, Wis., where he returned in the early 1980s after a career as 
a lifeguard and surf innovator in Hawaii and Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by Kahanamoku, Blake moved to the West Coast in 1921 at age 19 to 
take up surfing. He gained attention when he entered a surfing competition with 
a board in which he had drilled holes to reduce weight. He became a national 
distance swimming champion for the Los Angeles Athletic Club and competed 
against actor and Olympic star Johnny Weismuller. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1930, Blake invented the first water housing used for surf photography. 
Five years later, after noticing a metal fin on the bottom of a boat, he 
decided to add a fin to a surfboard. The sturdy boards became so popular that 
lifeguards made them a standard piece of lifesaving equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 At Thursday's ceremony, Blake's biographer, Gary Lynch, read from a letter by 
Blake, which read in part: "Nature equals God for all practical thinking. And 
that keeps us on the wave of life." 
</P>
<P>
 At the last minute, the surf walk's organizers agreed to pay $1,000 to the 
Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which owns the trademark "Walk of Fame." Under 
an agreement, Huntington Beach can use the name Surfing Walk of Fame for five 
years with an option to extend that time. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for a walk of fame began in 1990, said Mike Abdelmuti and Ron 
Abdelfattah , co-owners of Jack's Surfboards, who donated $30,000 to get the 
project started.

RUSSIAN TAX POLICE RAID MMM OFFICE, HOME OF ITS CHIEF; FINANCE: AFTER 
COLLAPSING LAST WEEK, THE INVESTMENT FUND ACCUSED OF DEFRAUDING MILLIONS IS 
STILL IN BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Search warrant in hand, Russian tax police came after the reclusive president 
of the country's biggest investment fund Thursday in the Kremlin's heaviest 
swipe yet at what it calls a colossal pyramid scheme that has deceived millions 
of novice capitalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of MMM, which claims about 10 million investors, collapsed last Friday. 
But the company made an amazing comeback this week, launching a new round of 
seductive television advertisements and attracting a monthlong waiting list of 
would-be buyers of its new shares. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday evening, tax police, backed by camouflage-clad special forces in 
black ski masks, raided MMM's central office and broke into President Sergei 
Mavrody's apartment in central Moscow as well, catching him at home with his 
bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government has declared war on us," Mavrody told the Interfax news agency 
by telephone, minutes before police entered his eighth-floor apartment by 
clambering down two stories from the roof on ropes. He had refused to open the 
door to them. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear if Mavrody had been placed under arrest or only subjected to a 
search and then brought in for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 What was clear was that the government was tired of MMM's defiance. And it was 
worried that imitators of the firm will continue to proliferate, giving the 
fledgling Russian securities market -- and capitalism in general -- an 
indelibly bad name. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is only the beginning," Dmitri Vasiliev, deputy head of Russian 
President Boris N. Yeltsin's special commission on securities, said of the 
problems MMM has created. "If the approach is not changed, the scandals will 
multiply." 
</P>
<P>
 The battle over MMM is mainly about money -- possibly as much as $1 billion. 
But it has also turned political. Mavrody claims he has so much support from 
happy shareholders that the government dares not touch him; he has threatened 
to launch a referendum and warned Thursday that tangling with MMM could lead to 
civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasiliev blamed the government's awkward position on its failure to enforce 
the law and get tough with blatant violators of securities rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Russian tax police have said MMM owes at least $25 million in back 
levies, Thursday's searches amounted to their first active attempt to bring 
charges. The Finance Ministry has come across as even more impotent; when it 
called Mavrody to a meeting on Wednesday, he failed to show. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Thursday's search was meant to determine how many shareholders MMM 
has and where its money has gone. If convicted of tax evasion, Mavrody could 
face up to five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the government record on MMM has been one of puzzling tolerance. 
The company has blanketed the airwaves with promises of instant millions for 
months, but authorities made no move to ban the ads because of a lack of laws 
governing them. MMM also issued far more shares than it had license to, then 
reportedly told inspectors it had lost its register of shareholders, thus 
apparently managing to stymie them with the ease of a pupil who says his dog 
ate his homework. 
</P>
<P>
 MMM has never been audited, Vasiliev said -- this despite government estimates 
it was pulling in $2 million a day on its shares. Only recently did top 
government officials begin to warn Russians that the firm was too good to be 
true and that they could lose all their money. 
</P>
<P>
 There has also been no proof of where MMM's money has gone, although Mavrody 
claims it is all invested in solid companies including some defense firms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps even more surprising than officials' passivity is shareholders' 
willingness to believe in MMM -- even after it cut share prices from $50 to 
about 50 cents last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government may do everything it can to stop MMM, but with 10 million 
shareholders, that is no easy task," said Sergei Zaichik, a retired engineer 
who invested all he had, about $3,000, in MMM and is holding on to his shares. 
"We are a force to be reckoned with." 
</P>
<P>
 In a deviation from usual market practice, MMM share prices were set by the 
company itself rather than by demand. For weeks, the firm provided investors 
with about 100% profit per month, apparently simply by using the usual pyramid 
method of paying off earlier investors with money from flocks of later ones. 
</P>
<P>
 When panic hit and people tried to pull out their money, Mavrody froze all 
trading, then dropped the share price so low no one would want to sell. He has 
promised that share prices will rise back to the $50 level in two months or so; 
his promises carry such weight that, brokers say, MMM shares in open trading 
were already up to about $4 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia seems to be the most gullible country on the planet," the Izvestia 
newspaper commented.  
</P>
<P>
 The government has announced it will not reimburse MMM investors for losses. 
Officials have said they cannot in good conscience use taxpayers' money to 
compensate gamblers, even if they are poor. "Market economics means, above all, 
the personal responsibility of each person," Deputy Finance Minister Andrei 
Kazmin told television viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, in a populist move that smacks of the old Communist days, MMM has 
been buying shares back at the old high prices from investors who are deemed 
"especially needy" -- mainly those who must pay for funerals and weddings. A 
standing commission now decides what cases are most worthy, and several hundred 
investors have reportedly gotten their money back. 
</P>
<P>
 And though MMM is suffering, dozens of other firms that offer basically the 
same kind of deal -- and use the same hard-sell ads -- are still flourishing, 
and investor interest does not seem likely to wane until firmer regulation is 
put in place.

RELIGION; POPE'S ENVOY HAD MEETING WITH MEXICO'S MOST WANTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even as Mexican church leaders were demanding that federal police find the 
drug lords believed responsible for the gun battle that killed a Roman Catholic 
cardinal and six others last year, the Pope's ambassador was secretly meeting 
with the suspected masterminds. 
</P>
<P>
 Papal Nuncio Geronimo Prigione's revelations that he spoke separately with two 
of the notorious Arellano brothers in December and January has set off a new 
wave of controversy in the sensitive relationship between the traditionally 
anticlerical Mexican government and the Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arellanos are believed to control the drug trade in northwestern Mexico, 
and since May, 1993 -- when a gunfight in the Guadalajara airport killed 
Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, his driver and five others -- the 
government has offered a $5-million reward for information leading to their 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the most wanted criminals in Mexico," said Atty. Gen. Humberto 
Benitez in an interview this week. "They are fugitives from justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Prigione has exacerbated the outcry by refusing to tell police what the 
alleged drug dealers told him, even though the statements were not made in 
religious confession. This week, politicians from four political parties called 
for the ambassador's expulsion from Mexico for interfering in domestic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "In cases such as that of Prigione, the Mexican constitution should be applied 
as in all (instances) that violate our laws," said Fernando Solana Morales, 
former foreign relations secretary and current ruling party candidate for the 
Mexican Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Prigione's main defenders have been priests and the conservative National 
Action Party (PAN), long linked to the Roman Catholic Church. One newspaper 
cartoon showed PAN presidential candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos 
sprinkling holy water on Prigione, who in turn sprinkled it on a drug dealer. 
The scandal's effect on Fernandez's campaign is not clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Sandoval, Posadas' successor as archbishop of Guadalajara, has defended 
Prigione while continuing to dispute the government's version that the cardinal 
was a victim of mistaken identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval has said publicly that he has spoken with at least four witnesses 
whose accounts of the shootout indicate that there was no confusion involved in 
the cardinal's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Benitez said the attorney general's office has not been given the 
names of those witnesses, whom Sandoval said are afraid of the police. "We have 
40 people awaiting trial in this case, and all of them agree that he got caught 
in the cross-fire of a gun battle between two narcotics gangs," Benitez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident is the most recent controversy surrounding Prigione, the first 
Vatican nuncio to Mexico in more than 60 years. President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari re-established diplomatic relations with the Vatican while eliminating 
the most egregious portions of anticlerical laws. Since becoming the Pope's 
ambassador, Prigione has been implicated in attempts to remove a bishop known 
for defending Indian rights in the southern state of Chiapas, where peasant 
rebels rose up against the government Jan. 1. Bishop Samuel Ruiz has since 
become an important factor in maintaining the uneasy peace in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The government was embarrassed by the cardinal's death, especially because it 
came so soon after relations with the Vatican were re-established. Prigione's 
meeting with the Arellanos has served to shift part of the public condemnation 
for the killing back to the church.

STUMPING FOR CANADA'S CONSERVATIVES; JEAN CHAREST HAS THE FORMIDABLE TASK OF 
REBUILDING SUPPORT FOR HIS PARTY, WHICH LOST ALL BUT TWO PARLIAMENTARY SEATS IN 
THE LAST ELECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG TURNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jean Charest might be forgiven if he feels a bit like the man who inherits the 
family mansion when a favorite aunt dies -- and arrives to find the house 
burned to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Charest, 35, is the new leader of Canada's Progressive Conservative Party, and 
it has fallen to him to rebuild on the wreckage left by his two predecessors, 
former Prime Ministers Brian Mulroney and Kim Campbell. Charest first sought 
the party leadership in June, 1993, when Mulroney gave up the post after 10 
years. He lost to Campbell, who made history by becoming Canada's first woman 
prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months later, Campbell made history again -- by leading her party to the 
worst election defeat ever in Canadian politics. The Liberal Party, led by Jean 
Chretien, swept to power, and of the 152 Conservatives in Parliament, only 
Charest and Elsie Wayne of New Brunswick survived. Campbell lost in her own 
district and was pushed out of the party leadership just before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Charest. 
</P>
<P>
 His rise surprised few in Canadian politics. A Quebecker who represents the 
Eastern Townships region southeast of Montreal, Charest is widely praised as 
thoughtful, moderate, articulate and ambitious -- a bright star in a new 
generation of Canadian political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 But few envy him his current task. Charest not only must rebuild on a depleted 
base -- current polls show Chretien's national popularity in the 60% range, 
with the Conservatives barely registering -- but must do so with a huge 
campaign debt. He also has new competition on the Canadian right in the 
Western-based Reform Party led by Preston Manning of Alberta. 
</P>
<P>
 Charest lacks even a consistent voice in Parliament. With only two members, 
the Conservatives receive no automatic recognition at "Question Time," the 
daily ritual in which the opposition puts the government in the hot seat and 
wins news media attention. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So, rather than sit quietly on a parliamentary back bench in Ottawa, Charest 
has taken to the road, speaking at party fund-raising dinners across the 
country, bucking up the troops and formulating a comeback strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to popularize the party by giving individual members more power and 
to intellectually anchor it with a permanent policy branch, a sort of in-house 
think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conservatives still have a nationwide voter base and organization to build 
on, he said. The Reform Party, in contrast, is just beginning to move out of 
its Western base and is handicapped by an unimpressive performance in 
Parliament thus far. 
</P>
<P>
 But Charest's best opportunity may come in his home province, where surveys 
show he is the most effective spokesman for Canadian unity. If, as many here 
expect, Quebeckers are presented with a referendum on independence within a 
year, Charest plans to play a lead role in the campaign against it. Should the 
referendum be defeated, Charest could emerge as "one of the most popular 
politicians in Canada," said Michael Meighen, a former president of the 
Progressive Conservatives and admitted Charest fan. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, not everyone foresees such a comeback. Manning, for example, 
believes Charest badly underestimates the profound repudiation that the last 
election represented for the Conservatives.  
</P>
<P>
 The precipitous fall of the Conservatives has a certain comic effect as well. 
A weekly program of political satire on CBC radio recently featured a sketch 
depicting Charest as addressing a dinner gathering of the party faithful at a 
McDonald's -- and repeatedly interrupting his speech to take hamburger orders.

BIGGEST NIGERIAN LABOR GROUP CALLS OFF STRIKE, PLANS TALKS WITH ARMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This nation's largest labor organization on Thursday suspended a 2-day-old 
national strike aimed at toppling the military government and said it would 
enter talks with army leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nigeria Labor Congress, a 41-union umbrella group, directed its 5 million 
members to return to their jobs but said it would consider resuming the strike 
Saturday if the talks fail. 
</P>
<P>
 The congress branch in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial center, said it would 
continue the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil workers also vowed to continue their month-old strike, which has deprived 
oil-rich Nigeria of revenue and nearly paralyzed the country. They began the 
strike July 4 to protest the imprisonment of Moshood K. O. Abiola, who appeared 
to be winning the June 12, 1993, presidential election by a landslide before 
the military government annulled it. 
</P>
<P>
 Abiola was arrested after declaring himself president on the first anniversary 
of the election. He is on trial for treason. 
</P>
<P>
 Shopkeepers in Lagos kept their stores closed for a second day Thursday, 
fearing another rampage by youths who used machetes to enforce the nationwide 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's streets were nearly empty. Soldiers and police protected a few 
groups of pedestrians from possible attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Congress President Paschal Bafyau said the organization called off its 
strike after the government requested talks "under a free and fair atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 Congress leaders later left for Abuja, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil workers say their strike has cut crude oil production by 35%. The West 
African country depends on oil for 80% of its revenues. Fuel shortages have 
shut down public transportation and many industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Compliance with the labor congress strike was heavy in Lagos and other 
southern areas where anti-government sentiment is strong. But the walkout 
largely failed in the north. 
</P>
<P>
 The two major oil unions, in a joint statement released Wednesday, said their 
strike would continue until the military steps down and hands over power to 
Abiola. 
</P>
<P>
 "No other action will be sufficient," they said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, police reportedly shot and killed at least two people while 
breaking up peaceful anti-government marches in Lagos. 
</P>
<P>
 Wole Soyinka, the 1986 Nobel laureate in literature, urged those protesting 
Abiola's detention to remain peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the things that are happening are a stain on democracy. Those 
organizing this violence are a disgrace to democracy," Soyinka said Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who went to Nigeria last week at the 
behest of President Clinton, said the country was headed toward a civil war in 
which "the bloodshed could be endless." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Nigeria controls a tenth of OPEC oil production, the United States has 
a clear interest in preventing civil war there, Jackson said after a White 
House meeting with National Security Council members.

8 CIVILIANS KILLED IN ISRAELI AIR STRIKE ON LEBANON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight Lebanese civilians were killed Thursday when Israel conducted its first 
strike against the militant Islamic group Hezbollah since the government 
accused it of attacking Jewish and Israeli institutions abroad, south Lebanese 
security sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 An Israeli army spokeswoman apologized for what she said was the mistaken 
bombing of a home in the village of Deir Zahrani. The spokeswoman said that 
"innocent civilians are not a target" and that the army "expresses sorrow for 
the casualties." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel Radio reported that the incident is under investigation by the army. 
</P>
<P>
 The air raid came one day before U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is 
due to arrive in Damascus, Syria, for another attempt at breaking the deadlock 
in peace negotiations between the Israelis and Syrians. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's incident is likely to heighten the already tense atmosphere in 
southern Lebanon, where Israel and Iranian-backed Hezbollah are engaged in 
deadly tit-for-tat strikes against each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Hezbollah has threatened to fire rockets into northern Israel if Israel 
strikes at it in southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 South Lebanese security sources said eight people were killed and up to 15 
injured in the attack on Deir Zahrani. The sources said a home and adjacent 
shop were flattened in a direct hit from a missile fired from an Israeli jet. 
</P>
<P>
 A husband and wife and their two children were among the dead. Two other 
adults and two children were also reportedly killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources said two earlier air raids struck at a Hezbollah base in the 
village of Ein Bouswar, located midway between the Mediterranean port of Sidon, 
southern Lebanon's largest city, and the inland town of Nabatiyeh. 
</P>
<P>
 Nabatiyeh borders Israel's 440-square-mile, self-proclaimed security zone 
above its northern border. The Israelis have occupied the strip since 1985, 
contending they must secure the border from Katyusha rocket attacks and 
terrorist incursions. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebanese sources said four Israeli jet fighters first fired four missiles on 
Ein Bouswar, then returned and fired a fifth missile an hour later, reportedly 
as guerrillas were picking through the rubble of the first strike. Three jets 
then reportedly attacked Deir Zahrani. There were no reports of casualties 
among guerrillas in Ein Bouswar. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of Lebanese began fleeing their villages in the south last month, 
seeking safety in the north after Israel threatened to make Hezbollah pay for 
bomb attacks on a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires and on the Israeli 
Embassy and another Jewish community center in London. Up to 100 people died in 
the Buenos Aires blast. 
</P>
<P>
 Villagers had begun coming home recently, according to Lebanese news reports, 
believing that the Israelis had decided not to strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel accused Hezbollah and Iran of carrying out last month's attacks, which 
Jerusalem said were meant to derail the peace process. Iran has denied 
involvement in the bombings, as have prominent Hezbollah sheiks. Hezbollah is 
funded and armed by Iran, and has vowed to sabotage Israel's peace negotiations 
with the Palestinians and Arab states. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Buenos Aires attack, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin called for 
cooperation among Western governments and intelligence organizations to thwart 
Hezbollah violence.

ARGENTINE FILES MAY HELP LOCATE CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a potential breakthrough in efforts to find the children of Argentina's 
"disappeared," a senior military officer has admitted for the first time that 
detailed files existed on babies born to women in jail, a lawyer and human 
rights activists said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 If the files can be recovered, several hundred children could be located, 
Estela de Carlotto, head of the Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, said in an interview. 
"This is very important," Carlotto said. "It is a revelation that allows us to 
investigate deeper, and it raises many expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 Retired Gen. Cristino Nicolaides, who served as army chief under the military 
junta that ruled Argentina until 1983, told a federal court that the records 
were kept and may still exist, said Maria Elba Martinez, an attorney for the 
Abuelas organization who was present during Nicolaides' testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, military and civilian officials had said that any files that might 
have existed during the dictatorship were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 During Argentina's "dirty war" in the 1970s, about 9,000 people "disappeared" 
in a terrifying military campaign of torture and murder aimed at eliminating 
dissidents and anyone else who got in the way. Among the victims were children 
who were often kidnaped with their parents and pregnant women who were arrested 
and gave birth in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The children and babies in some cases were given to other families in illegal 
adoptions, their identities lost, seemingly, forever. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, the Abuelas organization was formed by grandmothers crusading to find 
the missing children of their missing children. Since the end of military rule 
in 1983, 55 children have been located, Carlotto said. She estimates that at 
least 400 are still unaccounted for, although the real numbers will never be 
known. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The files revealed by Nicolaides presumably would provide details on what 
happened to specific children -- whether they were killed, adopted or whatever 
their fate. He testified behind closed doors in a court in Cordoba, in central 
Argentina, for four hours Wednesday, as part of a case brought by the Abuelas 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 He refused to comment on what he told the judge. Asked if he had provided 
concrete information on files, he said, "In some cases, yes, in others, no," 
said the Diarios y Noticias wire service in a report from Cordoba. 
</P>
<P>
 But Martinez, the Abuelas attorney, told a radio interviewer Thursday that 
Nicolaides said the files existed and should be in the custody of the interior 
and defense ministries and other military installations. "He said everything 
was in writing . . . carefully documented," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 55 children located, Carlotto said, 31 were returned to their biological 
families -- usually a grandparent or other relative because the parents had 
been killed. Thirteen children were found to have been adopted in good faith; 
those children remained with their adoptive parents but keep in contact with 
their biological relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven children were found to have been killed. The cases of four children are 
being fought in court to remove them from adoptive parents who allegedly knew 
they were participating in an illegal adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 When democracy was restored, Argentina took the bold step of prosecuting and 
jailing several officers held responsible for the savagery of the "dirty war." 
But they were pardoned and freed by President Carlos Saul Menem shortly after 
he came to power in 1989.

DEMOCRATS, CHICAGO, MEMORIES TO CONVENE IN '96; CONVENTION: PARTY AND CITY 
WHOSE REPUTATIONS WERE BLOODIED IN '68 WILL TRY AGAIN. PAYMENT OF POLITICAL 
DEBT TO DALEY FORCES IS A FACTOR IN CHOICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Hoping finally to exorcise the demon memory of its last, bloody national 
convention here in 1968, the Democratic National Committee announced Thursday 
that it will nominate its next presidential candidate in this heartland 
metropolis in August, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Much has changed in the 26 years since Chicago police battered anti-Vietnam 
War protesters in downtown streets and parks while convention delegates quashed 
dissent and debate on the floor -- with the action both outside and inside 
orchestrated by Mayor Richard J. Daley. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Hayden, then a New Left leader who was charged with inciting a riot, is 
now a California state senator who expects to attend this convention as a 
delegate. One anti-war protester of that era, though far removed in England at 
the time, is now President of the United States. Chicago's mayor is still 
Richard Daley, but his middle initial is M., and he is known as "Rich," not 
"Boss," as was his late father. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important for us," Daley said Thursday, adding a twist on the old 
protesters' refrain: "During this period, the whole world will be watching . . 
. our city." While exact dates for the convention have not been set, the new 
United Center is available from Aug. 22 to Aug. 29 and Daley said that the 
event will probably be scheduled during the last week of the month.  
</P>
<P>
 Though the city hosted Democratic conventions at least once and sometimes 
twice each decade between the 1930s and 1960s, "Chicago hasn't been 
blacklisted" since the 1968 tumult, Democratic National Chairman David Wilhelm 
said. The city did not have adequate facilities for a television-age convention 
until the 23,000-seat United Center was built, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection also illustrates the eternal verities of politics. United Center 
will be the site two years from now in part because President Clinton owes 
large political debts to the mayor and his brother, William, who helped 
shepherd the North American Free Trade Agreement through a balky Congress. 
Another reason is that Los Angeles, in vote-rich California, withdrew from the 
running after the devastating earthquake earlier this year. Illinois is also a 
significant factor in the Electoral College. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago's $32.1-million bid package was by far the largest submitted by the 
contenders, which also included New York, San Antonio and New Orleans. Daley 
said that the city anticipates a $100-million boost to the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, echoes of the past hovered over negotiations to bring the convention 
here, especially when local black leaders threatened to disrupt the 1996 
meeting if minorities do not get a bigger piece of service and concessions 
contracts. Though word was leaking out that Chicago was the Democrats' choice, 
the announcement was delayed while contract discussions continued with angry 
African American politicians, who said they wanted 40% of the contracts to go 
to minorities and 20% to women. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They said that they had to set their sights that high because they are sure 
the Democrats and the city will not meet whatever goal is targeted. They were 
not appeased by the solution offered by Wilhelm and Daley, who said they will 
appoint an oversight committee to make sure that 25% of the contracts go to 
minorities and 5% go to women.  
</P>
<P>
 Hayden, too, is mulling whether to organize a demonstration, this time for 
campaign finance and lobbying reform, unless he can get a commitment for a 
platform plank to scrap the current system by 1998.  
</P>
<P>
 "What better way to do it than the convention?" he said. "Back then (in 1968), 
it was machine politics but the focus has shifted much more to money politics."

N.Y. SNIPER STRIKES AGAIN; LONE GUNMAN IS SUSPECTED

<TEXT>
<P>
 A sniper who fires through the windows of late-night businesses on Long Island 
struck for a third time in two weeks, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe one person is responsible for the attacks, which have 
apparently targeted victims at random. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aspects of the ballistics give us cause to believe they may be connected," 
said Detective Lt. John Gierasch, commander of Suffolk County homicide squad. 
</P>
<P>
 The sniper is using a high-powered rifle with a scope and firing at the 
targets from a distant wooded area, Gierasch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These shots were very well placed," he said. "They are accurate shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they have no motive for the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest attack came Wednesday night. A waitress inside a Burger King 
restaurant in Stony Brook was wounded by a bullet that came through the 
restaurant's front window as she was cleaning tables, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathryn A. Spatafora, 43, was in critical but stable condition at the 
University Medical Center on Thursday with a wound to her upper torso. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous two shootings occurred in Commack, 10 miles from Stony Brook, on 
July 22 and July 25, Gierasch said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first case, a man was killed by a gunshot through a restaurant window 
as he sat in a booth having dinner with his wife. Four days later, at a gas 
station a quarter-mile away, an attendant escaped injury when a gunshot 
shattered but didn't penetrate the service station's bulletproof glass. 
</P>
<P>
 All three shootings took place between 9:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have beefed up patrols in those areas.

NASA ROBOT RESUMES TREK FROM VOLCANO 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A robot exploring the inside of an active Alaskan volcano began walking again 
Thursday after its remote power supply was fixed by engineers, scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-legged Dante II robot had started to climb back up the inside of the 
Mt.Spurr volcano, 90 miles west of Anchorage, Wednesday after completing its 
science mission when it suffered a loss of power, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 It spent the night and part of Thursday stranded some 600 feet below the rim 
of the crater. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers, flown by helicopter to examine a generator near the volcano rim 
which supplies power to the robot, managed to repair the problem, said Butler 
Hine, a project scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Power came back up. It (the robot) has resumed the walk up the mountain," he 
told Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
 Hine is one of the scientists at NASA's Ames Research Center near San 
Francisco who are monitoring the mission via satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA, which spent $1.7 million to build the robot, hopes to put its research 
to use one day by using a robot to explore the moon or Mars.

ANTI-ABORTION STANCE OF CHINESE TO BECOME GROUNDS FOR U.S. ASYLUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton has decided to alter U.S. policy and grant refuge in the 
United States to Chinese immigrants who claim that they will be punished for 
opposing abortion in their homeland, government officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy, which is expected to be announced today, would halt the 
deportation of many Chinese immigrants, such as those who arrived in New York 
City last year aboard the freighter Golden Venture and claimed political asylum 
on grounds that they would be persecuted for resisting abortions or mandatory 
sterilization.An estimated 1,000 illegal Chinese immigrants are in detention, 
awaiting deportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the George Bush Administration, Chinese merely had to indicate to 
immigration officials that they feared possible persecution for their 
birth-control views to qualify for political asylum. Immigration officials have 
said that many illegal Chinese immigrants arrived with apparently rehearsed 
speeches about their desires for large families and that the Bush policy was an 
invitation to massive immigration fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Clinton Administration policy, Chinese immigrants who merely said they 
opposed abortion would be deported. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy would grant asylum only to individuals who can prove that they, 
in particular, fear punishment for refusing to undergo abortions or who face 
forced sterilization. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials argued, however, that Clinton was signaling would-be immigrants 
in China that U.S. doors were once again open. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem in the past, said former general counsel Grover Rees of the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service, has been that, even though the rules 
are not as liberal as Chinese think, thousands -- including many single men who 
claim they want large families -- try to enter the United States, only to be 
denied. They are then punished upon their return to China.

ADMINISTRATION ACTS TO SETTLE SUIT ON RELEASE OF HEALTH GROUP RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration said Thursday that it will enter private talks this 
afternoon aimed at settling a lawsuit over whether it must publicly release the 
records of its 1993 health care working group. 
</P>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and White House adviser Ira Magaziner led 
the 500-plus-member group's deliberations that led to the President's health 
care plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assn. of American Physicians and Surgeons, the American Council for Health 
Care Reform and the National Legal Policy Center are seeking hundreds of 
thousands of transcripts, drafts, minutes and other documents generated by the 
working group. 
</P>
<P>
 The three organizations contend federal law requires any such group to meet in 
public if it includes non-government members who may have their own agendas. 
</P>
<P>
 Government lawyer Mark Stern has argued that the working group was too loosely 
structured to be covered by the federal advisory panel law.

CLINTON'S TV ADS PUSH HEALTH REFORM; LEGISLATION: ALL-OUT EFFORT AIMS AT 
SPEAKING 'DIRECTLY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.' ADMINISTRATION IS VAGUE ABOUT WHAT 
BILL THE PRESIDENT IS BACKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton appeared in paid television advertisements Thursday and 
members of his Cabinet hit the road for press interviews as the Administration 
began an all-out effort to lobby for passage of health reform. 
</P>
<P>
 But as has been true for weeks, the Administration continued to be vague about 
precisely what bill the President is supporting, a stance attributable to the 
tangled politics of Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 With at least two differing proposals being offered by the Democratic 
leadership -- one by House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), the 
other by Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) -- Clinton carefully 
avoided endorsing any specific piece of legislation in the television ads. 
Instead, he urged support only for "the new health care approach that will be 
voted on soon." 
</P>
<P>
 "Whose plan passes is not important," Clinton says in the Cable News Network 
ad. "What is important is that you have guaranteed private health insurance 
that can never be taken away." 
</P>
<P>
 Whose bill passes is, however, quite important to the members of Congress who 
have to vote on them. In the House, Democrats increasingly have been warning 
that Gephardt's approach is in danger. Many Democrats are nervous about voting 
for the bill's requirement that all companies insure their workers unless the 
Senate does so as well. Clinton's praise for Mitchell's bill in his press 
conference Wednesday night appeared to be easing the way for other Democrats to 
suggest that something less sweeping than Gephardt's plan might be better. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's bill would impose an employer mandate in the year 2002 and then 
only on a state-by-state basis if a combination of insurance market reforms and 
subsidies have not succeeded in covering at least 95% of the Americans in a 
particular state. 
</P>
<P>
 House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) insisted that he is "highly confident" 
Gephardt's bill will pass. The House is now scheduled to spend the week of Aug. 
15 debating and voting on health care reform with a final vote scheduled for 
Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 But few seemed to share Foley's professed confidence. "I think you might see . 
. . (that) we'll cut out everything . . . and slip in (the) Mitchell (bill)," 
Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) said in an interview. "Everybody here's in an 
uproar," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 There was additional uproar in the Senate, where Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.) objected from the floor to Clinton's implication during his Wednesday 
night press conference that GOP-sponsored health reform bills would not help 
Americans such as Daniel Lumley and John Cox, whom the President introduced 
during the session. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I know, every single bill that has been introduced by Democrats, 
Republicans or bipartisan groups takes care of the pre-existing conditions," 
Dole said, referring to the current insurance industry practice of restricting 
coverage for people who already have health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Some conservatives and moderates might vote for a bill that concentrated on 
eliminating such restrictions and did little more. The problem that Clinton and 
his allies in Congress face, however, is that moves aimed at producing a more 
limited bill are unlikely to gain even a single Republican vote in the House, 
where Republican members seem united against anything close to what Clinton has 
proposed. But such more limited bills would risk losing Democratic votes from 
liberals who think that Mitchell already has compromised too much. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Five liberal Democratic senators called a press conference Thursday to say 
that their votes for Mitchell's bill "cannot be taken for granted" and that the 
majority leader's bill must be "strengthened" to ensure greater coverage than 
95% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very determined to improve this bill," said Sen. Paul Wellstone 
(D-Minn.). He was joined by Sens. Paul Simon of Illinois, Tom Harkin of Iowa, 
Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin and Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another group, this one made up of moderate Republicans and conservative 
Democrats led by Reps. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), J. Roy Rowland (D-Ga.), Fred 
Grandy (R-Iowa) and Michael Bilirakis (R-Fla.), has been working against a 
Monday deadline to produce an alternative bill that could be offered on the 
House floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper and his colleagues in the past have offered proposals that would reform 
insurance markets to ban discriminatory practices, thus allowing consumers to 
take their insurance from job to job and to buy coverage even though they or 
their family members have existing illnesses. They would also offer some 
subsidies to help lower-income workers afford insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of insurance reforms and subsidies has been highly popular 
among many members of Congress, who see the approach as a politically safer 
alternative to the employer mandates contained in Gephardt's bill and, in a 
weaker form, in Mitchell's. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The key problem for the moderate group has been its inability to agree on how 
to pay for the subsidies that its members back. Most Republicans have been 
unwilling to sign onto anything that even resembles a tax increase to pay for 
subsidies, Grandy has said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House, Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said that the Clinton 
television ads are an effort "to speak directly to the American people. There's 
been an incredible amount of information and misinformation around the issue of 
health care over the months. More money has been spent on this issue than on 
any other issue of public policy perhaps in history." 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic strategists hope to broadcast the two-minute ads on CNN every night 
until the Senate begins voting on health care next week. The move is unusual -- 
presidents routinely advertise during their reelection campaigns but do not 
ordinarily do so to urge support for their programs. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials said that they chose the approach in part because ABC, 
CBS and NBC had refused to provide free time for an Oval Office speech on 
health care. The three commercial networks also declined to sell time to the 
Democratic National Committee for the two-minute advertisements, saying that 
they already had sold all the time they had set aside for political 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 The spots will be appear on the cable network at 4:50 p.m. Pacific time.

NAACP'S CHAVIS REJECTS CALLS TO RESIGN; CONTROVERSY: EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SAYS HE 
HAD AUTHORITY TO USE HIS ORGANIZATION'S MONEY TO SECRETLY SETTLE A THREATENED 
SEX DISCRIMINATION SUIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 NAACP Executive Director Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., refusing to yield to mounting 
demands that he resign, said Thursday that it is within his authority to pledge 
the organization's funds to pay up to $332,000 to settle a threatened sex 
discrimination suit brought by a disgruntled former employee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no intention of resigning from the NAACP," the head of the civil 
rights group told reporters at a news conference here. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis, who said that he has been under pressure from NAACP and financial 
backers to clarify the situation, said that sexual harassment charges were not 
involved in the secret agreement with Mary E. Stansel, his former aide. Chavis 
paid her $84,000 -- including $64,000 in NAACP money -- as part of a settlement 
in which she dropped a sexual discrimination and wrongful discharge suit 
against the organization. Terms of that agreement provided for the NAACP to 
help Stansel find an $80,000-a-year job in Washington or pay her up to 
$330,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis declined to discuss whether he had a personal relationship with Stansel 
or the nature of her duties during the six weeks that she worked as his deputy 
at the NAACP's Baltimore headquarters. He acknowledged that news reports 
suggesting he had sexually harassed Stansel -- which he called "false" -- have 
hurt his standing with some NAACP members and with some financial backers of 
the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, an official representing NAACP chapters in Oregon and Washington 
state has threatened to withhold money from the national office until the 
matter is investigated and resolved by the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NAACP currently faces a crisis in leadership, finances and integrity," 
Greg Evans, president of the Washington-Oregon State Conference of Branches, 
said in a letter dated Aug. 1 to NAACP board chairman William F. Gibson. "I 
believe the situation we are currently faced with demands immediate and 
demonstrative action." 
</P>
<P>
 At his news conference, Chavis predicted that he will receive a vote of 
confidence from the NAACP board of directors when it meets to consider the 
matter on Aug. 20 in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggestions that sexual harassment was involved in the settlement are "without 
merit," Chavis said, and have been used "as a ploy to defame both my good 
character and the reputation of the NAACP." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis distributed a letter that he said was written and signed by Rose M. 
Sanders, a noted civil rights attorney from Selma, Ala., who represented 
Stansel in the settlement agreement. "I at no time posed sexual harassment as 
an issue," the letter read. "Sexual discrimination, however, was a claim raised 
and resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 Waving an enlarged copy of the letter before the news cameras, Chavis said: 
"This letter documents the fact that the allegation of sexual harassment was 
never an issue during the negotiation of the agreement concerning Ms. Stansel's 
dispute with the NAACP." He said the letter does not imply that he or the 
National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People is guilty of 
discrimination against Stansel. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as Chavis was elected to lead the organization in April, 1993, he was 
embroiled in a series of fights with members of the board over the direction 
and policies of his administration. Both critics and supporters said that 
Chavis' leadership has angered factions among the organization's traditional 
supporters -- most notably older middle-class black members, Jewish leaders and 
labor organizations -- who oppose his outreach to controversial groups such as 
gangs, gangsta rappers and nationalist black leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Womack, director of the civil rights department of the AFL-CIO in 
Washington, said he told Chavis and Gibson that organized labor is not happy 
with their leadership. "Our support for the NAACP is strong and ongoing," he 
said in an interview. "But in terms of the leadership of the NAACP, that may be 
where the question mark is." 
</P>
<P>
 Womack said organized labor will express its displeasure with Chavis and 
Gibson by redirecting its contributions. "I see less funds going to the 
national (office) and more to the local branches," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 During his news conference, Chavis said that he has talked with major NAACP 
funders, including the Ford Foundation, about recent news reports alleging 
sexual harassment of Stansel. He said he assured the foundation officials that 
nothing improper had transpired with their money. 
</P>
<P>
 Although figures are not available, some board members said privately that 
corporate contributions to the NAACP have waned as controversy has followed 
Chavis. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis, however, disagreed. He said that corporate contributions to the 
organization's estimated $16-million annual budget are up 14% over last year.

<P>
 A rapidly spreading wildland fire in the Sierra just west of Verdi exploded to 
about 1,200 acres Thursday in its first five hours and damaged or destroyed 
three homes, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The homes were among a handful of custom houses at the Sierra foothills. At 
least three were damaged or lost along with three outbuildings, fire 
spokeswoman Carol Burcell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crystal Peak fire was reported shortly before 2 p.m. and raced through 
about 1,000 acres on the California side of the state line before it was three 
hours old, said Tahoe National Forest spokesman Jerry Kent in Truckee, Calif.

SECURITY AT ABORTION CLINICS IS QUESTIONED; PROTESTS: INDIANA DEMONSTRATIONS 
SPOTLIGHT THE INCONSISTENCIES IN FEDERAL OFFICIALS' PROTECTION PLANS, SOME SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first test of the Clinton Administration's resolve to guard abortion 
clinics across the country, federal marshals on Thursday monitored a peaceful 
protest at a clinic here while abortion-rights leaders complained that uneven 
responses and official uncertainty have marred the government's security 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two marshals watched from a gray van as 300 anti-abortion protesters 
sang "Ave Maria" and hoisted photographs of dead fetuses near a Women's Health 
Organization clinic that has been the scene of repeated demonstrations and 
arrests in recent years. A longstanding federal court injunction hampered 
protesters' efforts to dissuade 14 clients from going into the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Flip Benham, director of Operation Rescue, vowed during a rain-battered prayer 
service that the anti-abortion protesters -- in larger numbers -- would 
continue their efforts through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Friday's here, but Sunday's coming!" he thundered. 
</P>
<P>
 National abortion-rights leaders who descended on Ft. Wayne in response to the 
Operation Rescue protests here and in South Bend, Ind., said that in the two 
days since Justice Department officials announced their clinic security policy, 
there have been glaring disparities in the actions taken by marshals in 
different cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshals in South Bend made regular sweeps through an abortion clinic this 
week, activists said. But in Ft. Wayne, marshals have kept to their van, 
watching but not confronting strangers who approach the clinic's entrance. 
Abortion-rights leaders report similar disparities in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 While making preparations for the Ft. Wayne protest, abortion-rights leaders 
also said they were unable to get a clear reading from federal officials 
concerning how marshals would deal with possible violence at the 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 One abortion-rights advocate said the officials also were unable to say 
whether marshals would monitor and record protesters' compliance with court 
injunctions and federal laws that restrict their activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly appreciate (the marshals') presence, but we're having a hard 
time understanding exactly what their mission is -- and we're not sure they 
know either," said Susan Hill, national director of the Women's Health 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Kohsin-Kintigh of the Feminist Majority Foundation's clinic defense 
project, said talks with federal officials, held in Ft. Wayne on Wednesday, 
were strained. "We left without basic questions answered," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department officials said Thursday that their actions are limited by 
the scope of federal law and by time. At a news briefing Thursday, Associate 
Atty. Gen. John Schmidt said the U.S. Marshals Service cannot "provide 
protection for all (clinics) and cannot provide protection indefinitely." 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt said Atty. Gen. Janet Reno and officials of the Marshals Service would 
consult with local police agencies before deciding which of the more than 3,000 
abortion clinics in the United States will be protected. There are more than 
2,600 marshals stations across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department officials have not made public the locations of clinics 
already under guard, but officials and abortion-rights leaders say marshals 
have been posted at the sites of some of the nation's most bitter abortion 
clashes -- in Milwaukee; Des Moines; Wichita, Kan.; Falls Church, Va.; 
Pensacola, Fla.; Melbourne, Fla.; Gulfport, Miss.; Jackson, Miss. and Fargo, 
N.D. 
</P>
<P>
 Two marshals have been sent to Ft. Wayne, where three other marshals already 
are stationed. On Thursday, the two marshals monitoring the anti-abortion 
protest declined to specify their missions. Said one: "We're here to observe." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials won praise from Dr. U. George Klopfer, an abortion doctor 
who was the target of the protest in Ft. Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 Klopfer, a blunt-spoken physician who changes motels frequently and scorns 
guards, agreed to federal protection this week after an anti-abortion activist 
was arrested in the fatal shooting of a doctor and his escort outside a 
Pensacola, Fla., clinic last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unrealistic for organizations to expect the Feds to do everything we'd 
like them to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Klopfer said he has been told that his movements are being monitored by FBI 
agents, but when he arrived in Ft. Wayne on Thursday, he was followed only by a 
car packed with abortion-rights escorts from his South Bend clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Feminist Majority also announced Thursday that volunteer escorts will wear 
bulletproof vests when they accompany women visiting Pensacola's two clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. John Britton, 69, and James H. Barrett, 74, were killed as the doctor 
arrived for work at the Ladies Center in Pensacola last Friday. Barrett's wife, 
June, 68, was wounded in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have charged Paul Hill, a former Presbyterian minister and outspoken 
abortion foe, with murder. He is being held without bond. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate on Thursday voted, 98 to 0, to condemn the Pensacola slayings and 
called on federal law enforcement agencies to ensure protection of abortion 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like it or not, abortion is a legal medical procedure in this country," said 
Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-N.J.). "There is no reason for doctors who provide 
legal abortion services to be threatened as they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Lautenberg was the primary sponsor of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those of us that are pro-life and feel very strongly about protecting the 
lives of the unborn also feel very strongly about protecting the lives of those 
that are born," said Sen. Robert C. Smith (R-N.H.).

PLAYER INDICTED IN DRUG CASE REJOINS RAMS; FOOTBALL: DARRYL HENLEY SAYS HE'S 
FIT AND FOCUSED ON SPORT. SOME FANS WELCOME HIM, OTHERS ARE ANGERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cornerback Darryl Henley was back in a Los Angeles Rams uniform Thursday, 
rejoining the team that released him in May after he was indicted on federal 
drug trafficking charges -- and saying that football is the only thing he's 
worried about right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just had a longer off-season," Henley said, describing a sabbatical from 
the National Football League that began Oct. 5 with a leave of absence after 
federal agents began investigating his alleged role in a cocaine distribution 
network they say operated out of his home in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 Several outraged callers to the Rams' Anaheim headquarters Thursday weren't 
nearly as nonchalant, one going so far as to say he was canceling his season 
tickets. But most fans watching the team practice at UC Irvine said they were 
happy to have another player that might help the struggling franchise get back 
into playoff contention. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need healthy defensive backs," said Irv Adlen, who lives in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Leslie Richardson of Yorba Linda: "He hasn't been convicted of anything 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, awaiting a Jan. 10 trial, on Wednesday signed a one-year, $350,000 
contract that includes several incentive clauses. He worked out twice with the 
team Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley refused to talk about the specifics of the drug charges after the 
morning practice, saying only that they hadn't been a distraction in his 
preparation for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "None (at all)," he said. "I act like you guys (reporters) aren't even there. 
That's my focus. It's only a distraction if I let it become a distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to say anything or relate to anything concerning the things 
that have happened. I've been directed by counsel, and that's the best way." 
</P>
<P>
 After working out with the second-string defense Thursday, Henley said he 
won't be making the trip to Madison, Wis., for the team's exhibition opener 
Saturday against the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
 As a condition of his bail, Henley is not allowed to leave a seven-county 
region in Southern California. His legal representatives have assured the Rams 
that it won't be a problem but are still awaiting a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't heard a thing," Henley said. "I didn't even know about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. John Rayburn, who is helping to prosecute the case, said 
it is unlikely Henley will get a hearing on his request to travel before Aug. 
22 because U.S. District Judge Gary Taylor, who is hearing the case, is out of 
town until then. 
</P>
<P>
 A Rams official also said no word was expected this week. The team isn't 
scheduled to play another game outside of Henley's travel area until Sept. 11 
in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 An unrestricted free agent after the Rams cut him in late May, Henley received 
clearance from the NFL Monday to return. He said there was no question he would 
do so with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to play here," he said. "It makes more sense to handle things here 
and get it done here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team has been good to me, stood by me. Coach (Chuck) Knox has always been 
upfront with me, and he told me I have to come back and work. And it's not like 
I haven't faced adversity." 
</P>
<P>
 Was Henley surprised that the Rams were so eager to re-sign him? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not at all," he said. "I'm grateful, but not surprised. I'm not a problem 
guy. I'm just taking care of my business. Everything that happened back then is 
in the background now. Every day is a new day." 
</P>
<P>
 Henley said he needs "a couple days" to get into playing shape. He said he has 
been working out twice a day with friends in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in pretty good shape," Henley said. "I wasn't winded. I'm just getting 
back into the right frame of mind. It's almost like a freshman, coming out of 
high school." 
</P>
<P>
 Henley said he received a "warm reception" from his teammates when he arrived 
at the Rams' training camp Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so mentally tough right now, I can handle this and that. I'm back out 
here to play football, and that is my primary focus, my only goal until the end 
of the season. I'm glad the Rams stood there and weren't afraid and gave me a 
chance to play football." 
</P>
<P>
 Safety Anthony Newman was particularly pleased his old friend had returned. He 
and Henley talked for 20 minutes after practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darryl is one of my best friends, and knowing he's back on the team fills my 
heart with joy," Newman said. "As to the things off the field, I have nothing 
to say. . . . All I know is I'm happy to see Darryl's face. He's been there for 
me, and I'm going to be there for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox also confined comments to Henley's play on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked good today, and he moved well," Knox said. "He's got those fresh 
legs because he hasn't been in training camp the last two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, a six-year pro from UCLA, started four games at right cornerback last 
season. He left with 186 career tackles and nine interceptions, and Ram coaches 
thought he was approaching All-Pro status. 
</P>
<P>
 He had visited the Rams' Anaheim training facility several times since he left 
the team, meeting with teammates and coaches. He was paid his salary from the 
beginning of his leave of absence until he was released. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley worked out briefly with assistant head coach Joe Vitt in October, but

 The Rams struggled to a 5-11 record last season after knee injuries sidelined 
starting cornerbacks Todd Lyght and Robert Bailey, forcing the team to sign 
free agents as replacements. Was it difficult for Henley to watch his team 
struggle?

 "It was an adjustment," he said, "but I had a few things to worry about of my 
own.

 "Now, I'm just glad to be here."

 Despite the positive attitude expressed by many, the day was not devoid of 
cynicism.

O.C. TOURISM TRADE FEELING THE PINCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Despite balmy weather and an influx of World Cup soccer fans, Orange County is 
having a lackluster summer for tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 Local hotels overall had fewer guests during the first half of 1994, and some 
theme parks reported sluggish attendance in the spring and early summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leisure business has been flat compared to last year," said Patrick Hynes, 
director of public relations for the 1,600-room Anaheim Hilton and Towers, near 
the Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Occupancy at Orange County's major hotels through June was about 64%, off 2% 
from the first six months of 1993, PKF Consulting in Los Angeles reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel managers were not the only ones feeling the pinch. Officials at many 
tourist attractions, among them Disneyland, said spring and early-summer 
business was slow. 
</P>
<P>
 "June was somewhat disappointing for us," said John McClintock, a spokesman 
for Disneyland in Anaheim. The Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, he said, may have 
scared away many of the park's potential visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts supported that premise. Esmael Adibi, an economist and director of 
the Chapman University Center for Economic Research in Orange, said the drop in 
hotel occupancy and the declining number of theme-park visitors are linked and 
will probably show up in lower year-end results for the county's $6.5-billion 
tourism industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim area, which has 18,000 hotel rooms within walking distance of 
Disneyland and is the county's top tourist and convention destination, saw its 
hotel occupancy rate plummet in June, dropping more than 8% from the same month 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say this is mainly the result of the earthquake, which was in 
January, when people are making travel plans," Adibi said. "Still, Orange 
County is a good place to vacation and, barring any other disasters, people 
will forget. It could be that stronger results in July and August will make up 
for this." 
</P>
<P>
 That appears to be the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "July has been much better than we expected," Disneyland's McClintock said, 
partly because of the theme park's newest parade, the Lion King Celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Briggs, general manager of Wild Rivers Water Park in Irvine, said that 
while May and June attendance was down, visitors have been streaming in since 
mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
 "We became very concerned," he said, "but since about two weeks ago, we've 
gone on a tear. . . . This could be our best summer since 1992, our best year." 
</P>
<P>
 At Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, spokesman Bob Ochsner said, daily 
attendance is up an average of 5% to 10% from last year, mostly because of the 
park's new Mystery Lodge attraction, a high-tech re-creation of an ancient 
Canadian Indian lodge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, tourism into Southern California has not fully recovered," he said, 
from recent natural disasters, including last fall's Laguna Beach wildfires. 
"We're seeing mostly Californians and other Westerners and a whole lot of 
locals. People are vacationing more in their back yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel occupancy rates in Los Angeles seemed to be making a comeback, 
increasing 6.9% for the first six months of the year to 65.5%, about one 
percentage point higher than Orange County's rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the 2% decline here, though, local hotels in some areas are doing 
well. Lodgings near John Wayne Airport, which generally cater to traveling 
business people, posted a 12% rise in occupancy for the month of June. 
</P>
<P>
 And sunny weather meant a boost for the beachfront Surf & Sand Hotel in Laguna 
Beach, said Bob Van Ness, director of sales for the 157-room hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "This summer is much better than last year. It's outstanding," he said. "The 
weather played a good part. And the World Cup helped fill the Southern 
California region. We didn't really expect that." 
</P>
<P>
 Several hotels farther away from the ocean, though, also reported gains. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a great summer and a great year," said Bonnie Best, director of 
marketing for the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel. The number of both corporate 
and leisure guests was up nearly 5% through June, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At nearby South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, Orange County's best-known shopping 
center, customer traffic has been "strong and steady" this summer, said Werner 
Escher, director of travel markets for the center. 
</P>
<P>
 But no tourist attraction in Orange County is booming more than the 4-year-old 
Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace in Yorba Linda. Since the death of the 
former President in April, average daily attendance has more than tripled, 
spokesman Kevin Cartwright said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been unbelievable. Never in our wildest dreams did we imagine this kind 
of response," he said. More Empty Rooms at the Inns 
</P>
<P>
 The occupancy rate at Orange County hotels and motels was off 2% for the first 
half of 1994. Though business at convention hotels has held steady, leisure 
travelers have been much scarcer than last year. June and January-to-June

STATE-OF-THE-ART BIG A BOARD TO DEBUT TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fans who go to see the California Angels tonight are sure to see at least 
something sparkle at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Making its debut at tonight's game against the Chicago White Sox will be the 
new $3.6-million Sony Jumbotron Video board. The board is bigger and more 
technologically advanced than its predecessor, which toppled during the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are its color images far brighter, but it is also a good deal more 
resilient, seismically speaking, officials said. Although the screen is 37% 
larger than the old one, it weighs only half as much, said Greg Smith, general 
manager of Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing about video boards is that 15 years ago they didn't exist and now 
you can't live without them," Smith said. "It enhances the entertainment 
opportunities we have with fans. They've come a long way." 
</P>
<P>
 The board features the newest technology from Sony, said Jumbotron spokesman 
Ted Dickson, including improved resolution and contrast, which will be 
particularly noticeable in the daylight. Measuring 30 feet high by 40 feet 
wide, it is the second-largest video board in North America -- behind only the 
one in the Toronto Skydome. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to its improved technology is its ability to combine hundreds of 
thousands of individual blue, red and green lights to produce near natural 
color reproduction, according to Sony. The new Jumbotron will produce an image 
that is 56% brighter, with twice the resolution and three times the contrast of 
the old Jumbotron. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is dazzling," Dickson said. "It's going to look as good, if not better, 
than what you see at home, even in the direct sunlight." 
</P>
<P>
 The screen is used primarily for replays and animation. Unlike the old 
Jumbotron, the new one does without the "Little A" motif that adorned the top 
of the video screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers, who began installing the new board between games in May, have been 
working around-the-clock for the last eight days and will finish the job in 
time for tonight's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have compressed into three months what I consider to be a six- to 
seven-month job," said Ted Rebelowski), project manager. "That Jumbotron will 
be up and running (tonight) thanks to a lot of teamwork." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it could be one of the last Angels' home games for awhile if, as 
threatened, major league baseball players walk out next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Jumbotron will also be usable for football, although how long it will 
be showing videos of the Los Angeles Rams is anybody's guess. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams exercised a 15-month escape clause in their stadium contract in May 
and are being courted by several cities, including Baltimore and St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the giant screen, which is in left-center field, will be ready when the 
Rams hold their home opener Aug. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the old and new Jumbotrons are video-display screens, not traditional 
scoreboards that post the line score or keep track of other ballgames around 
the country. The Big A already has those. 
</P>
<P>
 The old 17-ton Jumbotron did some $10 million in damage when it fell during 
the pre-dawn earthquake, putting out of commission about 1,000 seats in the 
stadium's upper deck in left field. Hundreds could have been killed if an event 
had been taking place during the quake, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony is lending the city $3.3 million to pay for the board, with the city yet 
to finalize how it will repay the loan. Money could come from insurance claims 
on the original Jumbotron's accident, federal earthquake funds or lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials were reluctant Thursday to discuss details of the seismic 
improvements in the new board because the city is considering suing the 
installers of the old board or others. 
</P>
<P>
 "The original Jumbotron was not up to code," Rebelowski said. "This one is up 
to the latest seismic codes. We're confident of the structural integrity of the 
design." 
</P>
<P>
 One major difference in the two designs is that the new Jumbotron will have 
its weight equally distributed among five columns instead of being supported by 
a single column as the old one was, Rebelowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since the opening of baseball season, the ballpark had been making do with a 
temporary video board, which was installed in the lower deck in left field. 
Because of the earthquake damage and the temporary video board, the seating 
capacity was reduced from 64,500 to about 60,000. All the "lost" seats will be 
back in action next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The final frenetic activity to get the Jumbotron working was evident to fans 
who attended the Angels' three-game series against the Seattle Mariners this 
week. No video was available and workers, who had removed the temporary screen, 
worked nonstop even during the ballgames, which was unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just kept the noise down during the game," said Mike McKay, the 
stadium's video scoreboard manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be great," McKay said of the new Jumbotron. "It's going to look 
so good. We've really benefited from the six years of technology" since the 
original Jumbotron was installed in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The old Jumbotron replaced an old-fashioned black-and-white video screen, 
which was installed as part of the stadium expansion in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 McKay, who began working at the stadium when it still had the black-and-white 
screen, said he is amazed at the newest technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody had any idea how committed teams would be to getting these screens," 
he said. "They obviously have become a major part of having a major league 
facility." Screen Debut 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Stadium's new Sony Jumbotron will display bigger, brighter images than 
the old scoreboard. The screen will have a greater range of video-graphic 
capabilities and will also be visible in direct sunlight. A comparison of the 
old and new Jumbotrons:

<P>
 Bigger, Brighter, Better Scoreboard improvements will create sharper images 
and letters that don't blur. Among the changes: * Screen is 37% larger *

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The new scoreboard uses light-emitting devices called cells. Each cell is 
composed of eightpixels, which are trios of red, green and blue lights. Used 
together, they create a single white dot. Cells are configured to maximize the 
number of dots per unit. More dots mean brighter, sharper pictures. Here's the 
light pattern:

VALLEY'S VIOLENT CRIME RATE DROPS SHARPLY; LAW ENFORCEMENT: POLICE SAY QUAKE, 
GANG TRUCE SPUR DECLINE. HOMICIDES DECREASE BY HALF IN EARLY '94. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Violent crime in the San Fernando Valley plunged dramatically during the first 
six months of the year, and Los Angeles Police Department investigators 
attribute the decrease to the Northridge earthquake, a gang truce and money 
made available for additional officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The most striking reduction was in the number of homicides, which dropped by 
just over 50% -- from 77 in the first half of 1993 to 38 in the first six 
months of this year, according to an LAPD analysis of the city's major crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest decline in homicides came in the areas patrolled by the Van Nuys 
and Foothill divisions, while Devonshire had the largest decrease in robberies 
and North Hollywood had the largest reduction in rapes and aggravated assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the drop in homicides, reported rapes were down 6%, robberies 
decreased 18% and aggravated assaults fell 8%, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Citywide, violent crimes fell 15% -- compared with 12% overall in the Valley 
-- while homicides citywide dropped 28%. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of neighborhood anti-crime groups gave credit for the change to 
community-based policing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime is down and that's good," said Harry Coleman, president of the North 
Hills Coordinating Council, a neighborhood improvement group. "It's 
deteriorated to the point where people in the San Fernando Valley have come 
together and said, 'Hey, we're not going to take it anymore.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Among law enforcement officials, there was no consensus on reasons for the 
Valley's 12% drop-off in violent crime, but most detectives cited the Jan. 17 
earthquake and a nine-month truce among Latino gang members in the northeast 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Devonshire (the northwest Valley's police division), the big reason is the 
earthquake," Detective Tom Broad said. "It displaced a lot of people from 
apartment buildings in gang-infested areas, (so) they've had to go somewhere 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 In the northeast Valley's Foothill Division -- where homicides dropped from 24 
to seven -- investigators said the gang truce has been an overriding influence 
on the drop in shootings and other crimes there. 
</P>
<P>
 "That has probably been the biggest factor in the number of homicides," 
Foothill Lt. Joseph Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other officers, however, said the drop was attributable to city funds that 
have been used to pay for police overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's other factors, I'm sure, but the biggest reason is that we were able 
to put more people out there," said Lt. Fred Tuller, who heads the Valley's 
CRASH anti-gang units. "Of course, we can't add more officers right now . . . 
but offering more overtime has had the same effect." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Tuller said police have been targeting high-crime areas -- a 
tactic that has also helped curtail violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of some crime-plagued areas, however, said that even though violent 
crime has dropped in their neighborhoods in the past six months, drug dealing 
has become more prevalent. 
</P>
<P>
 Some blame the truce, which they claim has freed gang members to openly deal 
drugs without fear of reprisal from rival gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not killing each other, but they are still carrying weapons and their 
drug sales are higher," said community activist Paula Rangel, who said her 
neighborhood near Sepulveda Boulevard fills almost nightly with a parade of 
passing motorists and 25 to 30 dealers who sell them crack cocaine and other 
drugs on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Granted, we have not had a killing, and I give them a lot of credit," Rangel 
said, "but they're not doing enough to (stop) drug sales." 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide detectives say the Valley's low number of slayings since January is 
reminiscent of days gone by -- long gone by. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been no gang-against-gang murders this year," said Broad, of the 
Devonshire Division. "And that just doesn't happen . . . not that I remember 
offhand anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some investigators adopted a more measured stance, saying there is no 
accounting for the highs and lows of crime, including the recent downward 
trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It runs in periods," said Larry Kagele, a West Valley robbery detective, 
speaking specifically about the decline in robberies. "There's nothing you can 
really attribute it to, except maybe officers working overtime and making good 
arrests." Decline in Violent Crime

 With the Los Angeles County grand jury moving quickly to look into the 
videotaped beating of a teen-ager by a Compton police officer, community 
activists Thursday called for charges to be filed against the officer and 
demanded that the city's police chief resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Humberto Guizar, who represents 17-year-old Felipe Soltero, was subpoenaed by 
the grand jury and ordered to turn over the crucial videotape that shows 
Officer Michael Jackson lunging at the youth and then striking him at least six 
times with his baton. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's Special Investigations Division is looking into the 
beating, but because no charges have been filed, it cannot subpoena witnesses 
or evidence. The grand jury, however, can order evidence produced. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson was called last Friday by a county children's social worker to the 
mobile home where Soltero lives with his mother, his mother's companion, Manuel 
Shigala, and five other children. The social worker had gone to the residence 
to investigate an allegation of child abuse involving Shigala, 41, and she 
alleged that Soltero had interfered with her and threatened her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's report on the incident said he had to subdue Soltero with his baton 
after the 130-pound youth hit him with his fist while being arrested. Jackson's 
attorney said Thursday that the police officer, who is short of stature but 
weighs more than 180 pounds, wrestled with Soltero before the confrontation 
seen on the tape. 
</P>
<P>
 With the tape's images shown repeatedly on local and national television for a 
third day, angry anti-police rhetoric was accompanied by church-sponsored peace 
rallies and calls for calm. 
</P>
<P>
 "They treat us like animals, and it's time for it to stop," said Theresa 
Allison, founder of the Mothers Reclaiming Our Children organization in Los 
Angeles, one of the groups that was scheduled to participate in a protest march 
Thursday night outside Compton police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that although Jackson is African American and Soltero is Latino, the 
issue is police abuse, not racism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's not make it like a black and Latino thing," she said. "It's human 
beings being beat up, human beings being discriminated against." 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 whites, Latinos and African Americans demonstrated in front of the 
Compton police station for about 30 minutes Thursday evening, chanting "No 
justice! No peace!" The group demanded that a civilian review board investigate 
charges of police misconduct and that charges be filed against Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not about color," said Antoine Brown, one of the demonstrators. "It's 
about the badge." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pedro Pallan, a Compton baker and past president of the city's Latino 
Chamber of Commerce, said the video "proves what we've been saying all along -- 
the Compton police have a hostile attitude toward Latinos." 
</P>
<P>
 Pallan and other Latino leaders in Compton said Compton Police Chief Hourie 
Taylor should be forced to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 The videotape comes at a time when racial animosity and competition for jobs 
and services in Compton is growing, said Robert Almanzan, a spokesman for the 
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. In fact, MALDEF and the 
Compton chapter of the NAACP organized a summit meeting of 300 African American 
and Latino community leaders in April to come up with ways to reduce those 
tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said: "We really need to see this incident for what it's worth and . . 
. get more information before things get heated up more than they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Michael Hannon, who represents Jackson, called attempts to paint his 
client as a racist "a complete fabrication," and said that the videotape shows 
only a fraction of what went on between Soltero and his client. 
</P>
<P>
 Hannon and witnesses at the Westland trailer park said that the two wrestled 
briefly until Soltero's 14-year-old sister tried to stop them. Distracted by 
the girl, Jackson let Soltero up and the youth put up his fists. That is when 
Jackson used his baton to knock Soltero down, Hannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson is "feeling pretty abused, generally, because the news is pillorying 
him based on about 25% of the story," Hannon said. He refused a request for an 
interview with Jackson, who has been placed on paid administrative leave by the 
Compton Police Department after the videotape was broadcast on KNBC-TV Channel 
4. 
</P>
<P>
 Guizar rejected Hannon's version of events. During a brief interview with 
reporters at his attorney's office, Soltero said in Spanish that he did not 
wrestle with Jackson but that the officer knocked him to the ground as he was 
being arrested. When he stood up, the officer hit him in the face with the back 
end of the baton, Soltero said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Guizar, his client later asked Jackson why he had not handcuffed 
Soltero when Soltero was down the first time. Jackson's answer, Guizar said, 
was that he "wanted to have some fun that day." 
</P>
<P>
 Soltero was examined Thursday by Encino neurologist Dr. Martin Levine. 
According to Guizar, Levine determined that Soltero has a concussion, a 
forehead bruise and an injured left elbow, which is causing partial numbness in 
his hand. On the tape Jackson is seen dragging Soltero to his patrol car by his 
elbow, using his baton as a hoist. 
</P>
<P>
 Guizar said Soltero also is experiencing headaches, impaired vision and 
difficulty sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the battle over ownership of the tape continued. KNBC, which 
broadcast the tape for the first time Tuesday, has said it purchased exclusive 
rights to its use for $125 from Soltero's godmother. Citing those rights, the 
station has refused to allow other stations to broadcast it. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, however, an attorney stepped forward to say that the tape was 
actually shot by a neighbor and that Soltero's family did not have the right to 
sell it to a television station. Jim Blancarte, a lawyer who represents Libidia 
Vasquez, said his client sold the tape to Soltero's mother for $60 with the 
understanding that she would only show it to police to get her son released 
from jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Hoffman, KNBC's vice president for news, released a statement Thursday 
night saying that the station had discussed the tape with Vasquez before 
purchasing it from Maria Quintana, Soltero's godmother. With Quintana's 
ownership of the tape now under attack, Hoffman said the station will 
investigate the issue further.

JURY PROBES POLICE BEATING; USE OF FORCE: COMPTON CHIEF HOURIE TAYLOR SAYS HE 
WAS SHOCKED BY THE TAPE, BUT DEFENDS THE DEPARTMENT AND SAYS HE HAS BEEN 
'TRYING TO SENSITIZE OUR OFFICERS TO THE COMMUNITY.' 
</P>

<P>
 The first time Compton Police Chief Hourie Taylor saw the televised videotape 
of one of his officers beating a teen-ager with a police baton, he was shocked, 
Taylor said Thursday. "I was surprised, certainly. I was shocked," Taylor said. 
"I'm not saying his actions were incorrect . . . but I wasn't expecting it."  
</P>
<P>
 The tape, showing Officer Michael Jackson hitting 17-year-old Felipe Soltero 
as he lay on the ground, was especially disconcerting for Taylor, who has spent 
the last two years trying to instill a new attitude in his 125 officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the videotaped beating of Rodney G. King by Los Angeles police 
officers and the riots the next year, Taylor has been putting out the word that 
brutal force is not acceptable in Compton, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're still a quasi-military organization, like all police departments. But 
we're moving toward community-based policing and trying to sensitize our 
officers to the community and the ethnic diversity within it," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 He became acting police chief just days before the riots began -- after about 
23 years on the Compton force -- and was given the job permanently in January, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 As chief, Taylor said, he has fired three officers: one for using excessive 
force and two for improper conduct. Two other officers left the department 
before they could be fired or punished for misconduct, but he would not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "On occasion we do have people who violate procedures and we react to that as 
quickly as possible," Taylor said.  
</P>
<P>
 In describing his department's record of discipline and citizen complaints, 
Taylor is quick to point out that his officers labor under a heavy workload. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, when 29 citizen complaints were recorded -- seven of them alleging 
excessive force -- his officers also handled 160,000 calls for service, Taylor 
said. In 1992, when seven of 25 citizen complaints involved excessive use of 
force, the number of calls was similar, he said. This year, 14 complaints have 
been logged, but Taylor did not know how many of those alleged excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you'll find that the ratio of complaints to radio calls is something 
like one-tenth of 1%," Taylor said. "That's a good record." 
</P>
<P>
 But some in the community are complaining that Taylor's record isn't good 
enough and that he should resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton attorney John Ortega said he filed a complaint of excessive force last 
November on behalf of two Latino youths and never heard from the department 
again -- even after the complaint was apparently found to be without merit, he 
said. Compton police have declined to provide specifics about any excessive 
force complaints.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Taylor) has done a little bit to change," but the change has not 
been fast enough and Taylor should resign, Ortega said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, however, says that change is already happening. And for an 
understaffed department with fewer financial resources than a big city, his 
officers do "a magnificent job," Taylor said.  
</P>
<P>
 Those who don't are quickly disciplined, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Discipline is common in an officer's career, even his own, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like Jackson, who was punished with a one-day suspension in 1991 for an 
off-duty incident, Taylor said he was also suspended for a day in the early 
1970s when he was a Compton patrolman. Although Taylor refused to elaborate on 
the incident for which Jackson was suspended, he did reveal the cause of his 
own suspension: having an on-duty collision in a patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to go through a career without some kind of discipline," Taylor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have tried to create a mind-set that we are going to be professional in our 
work, or the officer will face discipline," Taylor said. "I hope that message 
is out there with all my officers."

SURF MEETS THE TURF; HUNTINGTON INAUGURATES WALK OF FAME WITH 6 IMMORTALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forsaking glitz and glamour, the Surfing Walk of Fame was inaugurated 
Thursday. It was hardly like the hoopla when a star is added to Hollywood's 
Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, this is Huntington Beach. And, these are legendary surfers, more 
known for attacking giant waves on surfboards than posturing before cameras and 
sipping mineral water with a spritz of lime. 
</P>
<P>
 After speeches by local dignitaries, the names of six immortal surfers, etched 
on small granite stones, were placed on the Main Street sidewalk near the city 
pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Filmmaker Bruce Brown, whose 1964 quest for the perfect wave, "Endless 
Summer," introduced surfing to the masses, downplayed the praise bestowed on 
him, in very un-Hollywood-like fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really feel like I deserve this," said Brown, 56, garbed in the beach 
uniform of a Hawaiian shirt, khaki trousers, and running shoes. "I'm flattered. 
But it's kind of embarrassing. I'm more comfortable sitting at home talking to 
my friends." 
</P>
<P>
 What did he plan to do after the ceremony? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going home to surf," said Brown, whose "Endless Summer II" movie was 
recently released. "With the movie now out, I'm trying to get into shape by 
surfing." 
</P>
<P>
 Master of Ceremonies Peter Townend, an Australian and 1976 world surfing 
champion who now lives in Orange County, introduced the four living inductees: 
Joyce Hoffman, a five-time world champion; Robert August, one of the stars of 
the original "Endless Summer"; Australian Mark Richards, a four-time world 
champion; and Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Two surfing pioneers were inducted posthumously, Tom Blake, a Santa Monica 
surfer who invented the surfboard fin in 1935, and Duke Kahanamoku, former 
Olympic swimmer and actor who was known as the "father of surfing." 
</P>
<P>
 "I never met Duke Kahanamoku," Townend said. "But I feel I'm a product of what 
he started way back in 1915 in Australia when he introduced the sport. To me 
it's an honor to talk about people like him." 
</P>
<P>
 Kahanamoku was an automatic inductee for the city's sidewalk. Born in Honolulu 
in 1890, the Duke, as he was known, became an inspiration to surfers of all 
ages. He helped start the first surf club in Oahu in 1907, and was voted 
sheriff of Honolulu 13 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Beside his contributions surfing, Kahanamoku also won five Olympic swimming 
medals and also had a stint in Hollywood with small parts in several films, 
including the 1948 "Wake of the Red Witch," starring John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kahanamoku died in 1968 of a heart attack, his funeral was the biggest 
Hawaii has seen. 
</P>
<P>
 For Hoffman, 47, of San Juan Capistrano, it was a day of pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to know that after 30 years, people remember you as giving 
something to surfing," said Hoffman, who was accompanied by her daughter, 
Samantha, 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman is regarded by some as the best female surfing competitor ever. In 
1965, she was named Los Angeles Times Woman of the Year, the only surfer to win 
the honor. In the '60s, she was unbeatable and won five U.S. championships and 
five world championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever the competitor, her daughter recalled hearing of her mother's toughness 
on a trip to a Santa Cruz contest with rival Jericho Poppler. "Poppler won," 
the daughter said, "and on the long drive home, my mother never said a word to 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 Those outside of surfing may not have heard of Tom Blake. Blake died May 5, in 
Ashland, Wis., where he returned in the early 1980s after a career as a 
lifeguard and surf innovator in Hawaii and Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by Kahanamoku, Blake moved to the West Coast in 1921 at the age of 19 
to take up surfing. He gained attention when he entered a surfing competition 
with a board in which he had drilled holes to reduce weight. He became a 
national distance-swimming champion for the Los Angeles Athletic Club and 
competed against Johnny Weissmuller, who went on to portray Tarzan in a series 
of films. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1930, he invented the first water housing used for surf photography. Five 
years later, after noticing a metal fin on the bottom of a boat, he decided to 
add a fin to a surfboard. The sturdy boards became so popular that lifeguards 
made them a standard piece of lifesaving equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 At Thursday's ceremony, Blake's biographer, Gary Lynch, read from a letter he 
received from Blake. "Nature equals God for all practical thinking. And that 
keeps us on the wave of life. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The inauguration went on after organizers agreed to pay $1,000 to the 
Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which owns the trademark "Walk of Fame." Under 
an agreement, Huntington Beach can use the name Surfing Walk of Fame for five 
years with an option to extend that time. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for a walk of fame began in 1990, said Mike Abdelmuti and Ron 
Abdelfattah, co-owners of Jack's Surfboards, who donated $30,000 to get the 
project started.

DANA PARSONS: RULES OF ENRAGEMENT FROM HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't you love it when outsiders describe Californians as laid-back? They'd 
have everyone believe that "Do Your Own Thing" is our unofficial state motto. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it used to be like that. But this place has become about as laid-back as 
Stalag 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's just Orange County. Lord knows, we all live here to escape anarchy 
and to vote Republican, so why complain about the latest chapter of the Control 
Freak Chronicles? Why even be surprised? 
</P>
<P>
 Here we go again with a homeowner association huffing up its chest and blowing 
a house down. This time it's the Highland Light Village Assn. in Santa Ana, 
where a young couple has allegedly violated a number of regulations set forth 
in the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions -- yes, the feared 
CC&Rs -- known to homeowners in these parts as the most fearsome set of codes 
since those in Cotton Mather's Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the violations charged to Valerie and Drew Keys: 
</P>
<P>
 * Left toys on the front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 * Allowed their children to play in the street. 
</P>
<P>
 * Left oil stains on the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 * Let Venetian blinds in the front window get off-kilter. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, the Keyses have received 16 notices of violations since December 
of 1991. The association has filed suit against them, asking the court to make 
them obey the rules and pay unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a time in America, the classic bad neighbor was easily identifiable: 
They blasted their stereo at midnight or gunned their Chevy at 6 in the morning 
right outside your bedroom window. 
</P>
<P>
 So, to maintain some semblance of order within neighborhoods or behind the 
gated walls of Paradise, residents got together and drew up rules to live by. 
They elected homeowner association board members. When CC&Rs work best, they 
keep crummy neighbors from wreaking havoc. 
</P>
<P>
 All too often, CC&Rs turn Joe Homeowner into Manuel Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
 I reviewed our files for past incidents. Strung together, it's like viewing a 
comic newsreel. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the Laguna Niguel association that protested a young family's swing 
set for their toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the Corona del Mar group that had a 35-pound weight limit for dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the Santa Ana association that cited a woman for kissing her 
boyfriend outside her townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 I could go on. I left out things like basketball hoops on garages or what 
color your house has to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, yeah, I know . . . property values. They'll go down if kids shoot hoops 
or play in the street. Life becomes pretty simple when it's reduced to property 
values. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought it would be fun to track down someone involved in a past squabble, 
just to see whether the passage of time changed their perspective. I found 
Jacquelynn Beiter, a school teacher and mother of six, whose family lived in 
the Crest De Ville community in Laguna Niguel. She and her husband were quoted 
in October of 1991 as being upset with the swing-set regulations that limited 
their height and what color they could be. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beiters still live in Laguna Niguel but moved out of Crest De Ville about 
18 months ago. They didn't leave because of the regulations, Jacquelynn Beiter 
said, but the intervening three years since she was quoted in The Times hasn't 
softened her feelings about the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our situation was financial (regarding moving out), but it also just wasn't 
the place we chose to raise our family," she said. "All the bickering. It just 
wouldn't be a place I'd choose to move back into." 
</P>
<P>
 I told her it's ironic that she now says she wouldn't want to raise a family 
there, because another family also chastised for their swing set had described 
the community before the dispute as a "wonderful place to raise our family." 
</P>
<P>
 "Those of us who had children, that's what we thought," Beiter said. "It got 
to where I wouldn't let my kids play handball against the garage because, my 
God, they might put a mark on it and one of the neighbors might complain. I 
stood up at numerous meetings and said, 'I teach kindergarten all day long' and 
that '5-year-olds can resolve problems much better than the very educated 
people in this community. It's ridiculous.' " 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Beiter to explain the association mentality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've analyzed it as much as I can and think what happened down here is that 
for whatever purpose, you ended up with all these homeowner associations who 
started with the intention of doing good things and unfortunately what happened 
is that all that came out of it was that it created wonderful litigation for 
attorneys. And we are the headquarters for attorneys in the country, so 
somebody's working." 
</P>
<P>
 The Beiters like their new house, but a few months ago a letter arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 It was from the homeowner association, informing the Beiters that, among other 
things, they had left the garage door open and that their dog had been barking 
too much.

SLAIN SUSPECT SERVED TIME FOR BANK ROBBERY; SHOOTING: AUTHORITIES THINK HE 
CARRIED OUT AN APRIL HOLDUP AT THE BANK NEAR WHERE HE WAS KILLED WEDNESDAY. 
THEY SAY HE FIRED AT OFFICERS BEFORE BEING GUNNED DOWN. 
</P>

<P>
 A suspect shot dead by police outside a Costa Mesa bank Wednesday is a 
convicted bank robber who is believed to have held up the same bank in April, 
authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, identified as John R. Mazak, 48, of Mission Viejo, served six years 
of a 26-year sentence at the federal prison in Lompoc after being convicted of 
armed bank robbery in New Mexico and felony weapons violations in Wisconsin, 
according to prison records. He was paroled in December, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators were tight-lipped about the shooting investigation Thursday but 
said Costa Mesa police were returning fire when Mazak was felled in a hail of 
about 20 shots in a parking lot near the Bank of Yorba Linda, 1700 Adams Ave. 
Investigators did not say how many officers were involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Mazak was firing at the police at the time that police shot him," 
Supervising Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans said. "Mr. Mazak fired at 
the officers. The officers returned fire." 
</P>
<P>
 A free-lance paralegal, Mazak had been behind on his rent lately, even though 
he carried large wads of cash, according to a real estate broker who helped him 
find a rental tract home in Mission Viejo in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "He carried a lot of cash on him. We couldn't verify any checking accounts. He 
carried cash only," said Monte Burghardt, a Laguna Niguel broker who said he 
saw Mazak's rental application rejected by several landlords because of poor 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Burghardt said Mazak was friendly and chatted about his upbringing in 
Wisconsin and his hobby of weightlifting. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a real laid-back guy, real mellow. He's real big -- wore Hawaiian shirts 
all the time," Burghardt said. "We talked about his football days. He told me 
how growing up in Wisconsin his family owned a bar and, because of his size, at 
13 or 14 he was working there." 
</P>
<P>
 The broker said Mazak was worried about crime and indicated on his rental 
application that he had left a Costa Mesa apartment in order to "move to a 
better area." In May, Mazak rented a four-bedroom home with a swimming pool in 
Mission Viejo for about $1,500 to $1,600 a month, Burghardt said. The landlord 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said they had little contact with Mazak and knew nothing about him 
except that he shared the blue and white house with two women, several children 
and a dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were fine neighbors. They looked like ordinary neighbors," said 
next-door neighbor Charlotte Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office declined to discuss its investigation. Such 
inquiries are conducted any time police officers are involved in on-duty 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank employees who spotted Mazak outside the bank building Wednesday afternoon 
recognized him as the same person who pulled a gun on a bank manager in April 
after demanding an immediate loan. On Thursday, authorities confirmed their 
suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe he is the subject that robbed the Bank of Yorba Linda on April 
20," said FBI Special Agent Gary Morley of the bureau's office in Santa Ana. 
Morley said authorities planned to review open bank-robbery cases to see if 
Mazak matched the descriptions of suspects in those incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank employees who saw Mazak called police, then trailed him as he walked 
away on Adams Avenue. When police arrived, Mazak led them on a chase through a 
nearby health club and into the parking lot where the showdown occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison records indicate that Mazak landed in Lompoc after being sentenced to 
20 years for a bank robbery in New Mexico in 1984, on top of a six-year 
sentence the year before for weapons violations in Wisconsin. Federal records 
indicate he had a previous felony conviction, but information before 1981 was 
not available on the prison system's computer. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Costa Mesa police shot anyone fatally was in April, 1992, when a 
Huntington Beach man suspected of credit card fraud and drug offenses pulled a 
gun on officers who approached him outside a pancake restaurant. A police 
officer was wounded in that incident.

COUNTY SEEKS TO INCREASE JAIL BOOKING FEES; REVENUE: CITY OFFICIALS ARE 
SURPRISED AT THE MOVE TO CHARGE THEM MORE. ONE SAYS IT "WOULD MAKE MY CITY A 
LITTLE LESS SAFE." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County officials are proposing an 11% increase in booking fees at the 
county jail system. That boost could force cities to pay thousands of dollars 
more each year to house inmates at any of the five county detention centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Long a point of friction between the county and cities, the fees would jump 
from $158 to $176 a prisoner if the proposed increase is approved by the Board 
of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The planned increase took some municipal officials by surprise Thursday, with 
many saying they had not been told it was being considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the strongest voice against an increase came from Garden Grove Police 
Chief Stanley L. Knee, who said that more expensive charges "would make my city 
a little less safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Knee estimated that his officers already are forced to issue citations and 
then release about 1,000 suspects a year because of "prohibitive" booking 
costs. Many of those arrested, the chief said, could have "benefited from some 
time in jail to cool off." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to question whether this is a good decision," Knee said. "But in this 
climate, you hold a person for a couple of hours and he walks out the front 
door" of police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove now pays the county about $300,000 a year to detain prisoners at 
county jail facilities. If the new charges are approved, the city would pay 
nearly $36,000 more each year. That is more than half the average salary of an 
officer in the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Moulson, manager of law enforcement contracts for the Sheriff's 
Department, described the proposal as "fairly routine" because there had been 
no increase in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "With any kind of fee increase, you are looking at recovering the costs you 
incur," Moulson said. "I'm sure this is an assessment of the fact that salaries 
have increased during the past two years and other related costs have gone up." 
</P>
<P>
 County budget officials could not be reached for comment Thursday, but 
statistics provided by the auditor-controller's office show that booking 
revenue has dropped in the past three years, from $2.7 million in 1991-92 to 
$2.2 million in 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 At least part of that drop can be attributed to the fact that some cities have 
built their own jails or have signed less expensive contracts for prisoner 
detention with other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana probably did the most of any city to reduce its booking payments 
when it opened its own 72-bed jail last December. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Santa Ana paid about $1 million to book its prisoners into county 
detention facilities. This year, Lt. Robert Helton said, that payment should be 
cut by 90% or more. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we didn't have that jail, this new fee would really impact us," Helton 
said. "That's a substantial increase." 
</P>
<P>
 Daryl Halls, manager of legislation and policy development for the Orange 
County Division of the League of California Cities, said his office had not 
been notified of the county's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first we've heard about it," Halls said. "We've been opposed to a 
booking fee from the start. Obviously, the cities would be against any 
increase." 
</P>
<P>
 Halls said the proposal comes at a time when local governments are scrambling 
to balance their own budgets and cannot afford to consider further assessments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the sheriff does a good job of managing the jail," Knee said, "but the 
issue is that we're paying for a service that we have absolutely no control 
over. We don't have any say about how the jail is run or how many officers are 
on duty. We have no control over the factors that could drive up the cost of 
housing them there."

JUDGE'S FOE MAKES CASE OUTSIDE HIS COURT; POLITICS: CARYL LEE IS JOINED BY A 
COUPLE WHO ACCUSE DAN DUTCHER OF BEING LENIENT IN HIT-AND-RUN DRUNK DRIVING 
CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A few paces away from where Municipal Judge Dan C. Dutcher dispenses justice, 
his opponent in the November runoff election staged a bit of political theater 
on Thursday with a couple who said they were wronged by the judge and his 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Caryl Lee, who is running against Dutcher, held a news conference 
to blast the judge for being soft on crime and accuse him of mishandling the 
case of a hit-and-run drunk driver who killed 13-year-old Jeff Martinez last 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Lee outside the main entrance of the Westminster Municipal Court where 
Dutcher is seated, were Ed and Gail Martinez, the boy's parents. The couple 
joined the campaign to defeat Dutcher out of anger with the judge's two-year 
sentence for the convicted drunk driver, a repeat offender who killed their 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 The news conference is the latest twist in a highly unusual political battle 
for the judicial post Dutcher has held for a dozen years. Just last month, 
Dutcher filed a lawsuit against Lee, alleging her campaign produced a libelous 
mailer that cost him victory in the June 7 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the Lee news conference ended Thursday, Dutcher emerged from the 
courthouse with his attorney to respond point by point to the charges made by 
Lee and the Martinezes. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of us is soft on crime," Dutcher said, calling Lee's characterization of 
him "mindless rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
 While planning to run with the support of fellow Orange County judges, Dutcher 
said his campaign was forced into the position of "refuting smear tactics." He 
said he filed the lawsuit against his opponent because he wanted the truth of 
his record to come out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They picked one case in 12 years that I handled and they smeared me on that 
one case," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 As they stood before a bank of television cameras, the Lee campaign criticized 
the judge on two fronts. The Martinezes -- already grieving over the loss of 
their son -- contended they are now being victimized by the judge, who is angry 
that the couple has gone public with their complaint against him. Lee and the 
parents also portrayed Dutcher as being soft on crime, as evidenced by his 
handling of the Martinez case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not here today just because justice wasn't served in Dutcher's court," 
Ed Martinez said in a prepared statement. "We're here today because Dutcher 
can't even leave us alone in our grief -- he has to keep hurting us." 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to the lawsuit filed last month by Dutcher against the Lee 
campaign. In the initial filing, the Martinezes were included as defendants in 
the lawsuit -- a move Dutcher said was done in error. The couple was quickly 
removed from the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been sued for bringing information to light that is contained within 
the public record and is all true," Lee said during the news conference. "I 
won't be intimidated by bringing things to light that I think should be brought 
to light. . . . I believe he's too soft on crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to turn the attention toward his opponent, Dutcher said Lee had a poor 
courtroom conviction record as a prosecutor, stating that she had lost the only 
two trials she had prosecuted in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not true," Lee later responded. "My trial record is not relevant and 
is not why we are here today." 
</P>
<P>
 Dutcher agreed with Lee on one point: "I think (the Martinezes) have suffered 
enough, to tell you the truth," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The judicial race heated up in the final days before the June 7 primary when 
Lee circulated a brochure that included a letter signed by the Martinezes. The 
letter listed the numerous mistakes they felt were committed by the "lenient" 
judicial system in the handling of Matthew Wilbur, a repeat drunk driver who 
struck and killed Jeff Martinez just a few blocks from his Westminster home. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the key statements in the brochure -- which is the basis of Dutcher's 
lawsuit -- is a claim by the couple that Dutcher "sentenced this repeat drunk 
driver to one year of actual jail time," even though he sentenced Wilbur to two 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 In the June 7 election, Lee received 38.1% of the vote and Dutcher received 
38%, forcing a November runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutcher said he filed the lawsuit in the hope that the brochure would not be 
used again before the November election. But on Thursday, neither Lee nor the 
Martinezes ruled out future use of the brochure -- which criticizes the judge 
-- claiming it was not inaccurate since Wilbur will serve about 14 months 
behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 The Martinezes also said they will seek state legislation that would make it 
easier to expose a judge's sentencing record.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; IMPROVEMENTS DUE AT PROBLEM INTERSECTION

 The screeches and bangs of cars colliding at the intersection of Magnolia 
Street and Indianapolis Avenue have been all too frequent for Father Gus Krumm. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Last week alone, there were three car accidents in two days at the 
intersection near Sts. Simon & Jude Catholic Church. Two years ago, a priest 
from another local church was killed near the intersection as he pulled into 
Sts. Simon & Jude's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, more than 50 people from the church congregation, in addition to 
local school district officials and residents, attended the City Council 
meeting to ask that something be done about the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the major concerns is that someone is going to die out there," Krumm 
said. "Every day, hundreds of kids go through the intersection." 
</P>
<P>
 There are four schools in the area: the church's school, Edison High School, 
Issac L. Sowers Middle School and S.A. Moffett Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Church member David Munce,17, who was involved in one of the accidents last 
week and was injured, told the council that his and "many other accidents could 
have been prevented. My first concern is the safety of all the people who use 
the corner to cross." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have agreed to install left-turn lanes in both directions on 
Indianapolis Avenue by Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this month, as council members comb through the proposed budget for next 
fiscal year, they will consider spending about $60,000 to install left-turn 
signals on both Magnolia Street and Indianapolis Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a serious issue. Our children's lives are an issue here," said Connie 
Greyshock,a church member whose children attend the local schools. "I would 
have liked to have seen a commitment to have the left-turn arrows before school 
starts." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jim Silva said he plans to make the signals a top priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will save lives in the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City traffic engineer James D. Otterson said 23 intersections in the city that 
need left-turn signals have been identified.  
</P>
<P>
 Office Mike Corcoran, police spokesman, said that from August, 1992, through 
July 30, there were 29 accidents at the Indianapolis-Magnolia intersection. 
Twenty-six people were injured in those accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten of those accidents involved drivers making left turns and failing to yield 
to oncoming cars, Corcoran said. In others, citations were given for running 
red lights and speeding.  
</P>
<P>
 Corcoran said the number of accidents is "certainly higher than the norm. . . 
. It's a hazardous intersection." DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; DRIVER CITED IN BOY'S DEATH WASN'T DRUNK

 The woman who police believe caused an accident that killed a 12-year-old boy 
last week did not have alcohol in her system when the accident occurred, 
according to blood and urine test results released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But police are still awaiting the results of additional drug tests before 
concluding whether 28-year-old Seal Beach resident Cynthia Kaye Lietz was 
intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
 If she is found to have been driving under the influence, Lietz could face 
added child endangerment charges because her young daughter was a passenger in 
her car at the time of the July 26 accident, said Police Sgt. Don Dye. 
</P>
<P>
 Lietz has already been charged with hit-and-run driving and driving with a 
suspended license. The Orange County district attorney's office also could 
charge her with manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary hearing in the case is scheduled for Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that Lietz caused the accident when she suddenly swerved out of 
her northbound traffic lane on Seal Beach Boulevard, forcing an adjacent car to 
jump the curb and hit Christopher Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-year-old was waiting to walk his bike across Seal Beach Boulevard at 
Bolsa Avenue at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Lietz fled the scene of the accident but was arrested a few minutes later. At 
the time, police said they suspected she had been driving while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident will be the focus of a public meeting today at 7:30 p.m. at the 
Mary Wilson Library in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents have called for the speed limit on Seal Beach Boulevard to be 
lowered from the current 45 m.p.h.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they will conduct a traffic study of the area but noted 
that speed was not a factor in the accident. SHELBY GRAD

<P>
 A series of summer activities sponsored by DARE will culminate in a grand 
finale fair from 10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. at Peak Park Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair will honor children who have participated in any of DARE's groups, 
such as martial arts and cheerleading, but the entire community is invited to 
attend, said Kim M. Garber-Bond, city recreation supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody can come, because we are celebrating life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police will offer fingerprinting of children and "Kinder Vision," a videotape 
of children that identifies height and characteristics, Garber-Bond said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other activities include an "Iron POGman" tournament that mixes exercise, 
POGs, cheerleading and tae kwon do clinics, and police demonstrations with 
Rocky the police dog. 
</P>
<P>
 DARE is the Drug Awareness Resistance Education program sponsored jointly by 
the police and recreation departments. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,500 parents and children are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Box lunches will be available for $3.50. 
</P>
<P>
 The park is on Knott Avenue north of La Palma Avenue. LESLEY WRIGHT

 Carol Patterson and other residents of the Harbor Health Care nursing home in 
Fullerton were so moved by the television pictures of suffering in Rwanda and 
Zaire that they decided to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 This morning they will open a drop-off point for donations to the Rwandan 
relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been watching the pictures and talking about it. We wished we could do 
something," said Patterson, a retired Costa Mesa schoolteacher. "Here's an 
opportunity to help." 
</P>
<P>
 People interested in making donations can stop by the nursing home at 2222 N. 
Harbor Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations will be accepted from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., seven days a week. No food 
products or other goods can be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 The cash and checks collected will go the American Red Cross' Rwanda aid fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributions can also be mailed to Rwanda Relief, American Red Cross, P.O. 
Box 11364, Santa Ana, Calif. 92711-1364, or delivered to the Red Cross office 
at 601 N. Golden Circle Drive in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will be used to send food, medical supplies and tents to refugee 
camps along the Rwandan border, where more than a million refugees face 
starvation, disease and lack of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson said other nursing home residents designed a collage of press 
clippings and photos of the crisis in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 The collage is on display at the nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children's suffering is the saddest thing. They seem so helpless," 
Patterson said. "We want to alleviate their misery." 
</P>
<P>
 The American Red Cross is also looking for doctors and nurses to work in 
Rwanda for three months, spokeswoman Judy Iannaccone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical professionals with experience working under emergency conditions and 
who speak French fluently are urged to call (714) 835-5381, Ext. 147. SHELBY

<P>
 Police from across Orange County will join the Sheriff's Department in hosting 
a "Night Out" against crime from 7 to 10 tonight at the Tustin Marine Corps Air 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The event will end a series of activities in Orange County and around the 
nation that began Tuesday with "National Night Out." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in every city were asked to keep their lights on and mingle outdoors 
in an effort for citizens to "take back the night." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our going-away party to crime," said Cpl. Adam Catan, crime prevention 
officer at the base. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to think about it as everybody's night out." 
</P>
<P>
 The police and sheriff's departments decided to have their event on a weekend 
night to make it easier for residents to attend, Catan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything from food to information is free of charge, he said. Prizes will be 
given away throughout the evening, and a disc jockey will provide music. 
</P>
<P>
 Police from Irvine, Orange, Tustin, Santa Ana, Huntington Beach and Anaheim 
have coordinated informational activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officers will demonstrate some of their skills, and Sparky, a 
dog trained for firefighting, will perform. 
</P>
<P>
 Children 6 to 12 are encouraged to enter the event's poster contest. 
</P>
<P>
 They should bring a poster with a crime prevention theme and submit it by 8 
p.m. to compete for a prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Brinks Home Security will join police in offering information on home and 
neighborhood security. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents can have their children fingerprinted and also learn tips on bicycle 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates will open for parking at the base, off Edinger and Red Hill avenues, at 
6:45 p.m. LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA / NEWPORT BEACH; STORM DRAIN PLANNED UNDER 15TH 
STREET 
</P>

<P>
 Residents of 15th Street know that heavy rains bring flooded intersections to 
their neighborhood on the Costa Mesa-Newport Beach border. 
</P>
<P>
 But that will soon change. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities are joining forces to build a storm drain under 15th Street that 
officials said will stop the flooding as well as improve the look of the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 The periodic street flooding has not affected homes, but officials said it can 
make driving tricky. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not desirable to have that much water in the street," said Bill Morris, 
Costa Mesa's director of public works. The improvement project will "keep the 
street drier during the rain and make it less hazardous for vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also calls for the installation of new sidewalks on 15th Street 
between Irvine and Riverside avenues. Some of the existing sidewalks are 
crumbling, and other portions of the street presently have no sidewalks, Morris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm drain is expected to cost about $400,000 to $500,000. The costs are 
going to be divided between the two cities. Work is not expected to begin until 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities recently allocated $11,000 to hire UMA Engineering Inc., which will 
draw up plans for the storm drain. 
</P>
<P>
 The work will require 15th Street to be dug up. "There will be some 
inconveniences while the construction is going on," Morris said. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; CIGARETTE VENDOR BAN LACKS SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to ban cigarette vending machines has failed to gain support from 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Without taking a vote, the council on Tuesday effectively killed the proposal 
that would have required all cigarette vending machines in the city to be 
removed in 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good move, but obviously I don't have the votes," said Councilman 
Bruce A. Broadwater, who acknowledged his defeat by not asking for a vote 
following the half-hour discussion by council members and public comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadwater said that a ban on cigarette vending machines, which several Orange 
County cities have adopted, would make it more difficult for teen-agers to buy 
cigarettes and discourage them from smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 But a majority in the council said that prohibiting the sale of cigarettes 
from vending machines will not deter young people from smoking because they 
will find other ways to obtain cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 A ban would also hurt local businesses still reeling from the recession, and 
it would be another intrusion into the private lives of people and an attempt 
to legislate morality, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be saying, 'We know smoking is not good for you, so we'll take 
cigarettes away from you,' " Mayor Frank Kessler said. "There are more 
important issues for us to be more concerned about." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the ban would be hard to enforce and that the city does not have 
enough code enforcement officials and police officers to go after violators. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Leyes said that bars, nightclubs and other businesses that 
have mostly adult customers should be allowed to operate cigarette vending 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ho Chung said the ban would be bad for business, and Councilman 
Robert F. Dinsen said it would not stop anyone from smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are more concerned about business and taxes than the health of our youth 
and our community," resident Colleen Chapman said. She attended the council 
meeting with her son, Jonathan, a senior at Bolsa Grande High School, who also 
pushed for the adoption of a ban on cigarette vending machines. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; COUNCIL VOTES TO CREATE FIRE BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week voted to join other cities in creating a proposed 
governing body for the Orange County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager George Scarborough told the council that San Juan Capistrano was 
one of the last cities to consider taking part in the proposed joint powers 
authority before the issue goes to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 If formed, the governing body would be launched this fall and assume full 
responsibility for the Orange County Fire Department, which serves several 
cities, including San Juan Capistrano. Each participating city would have a 
voting member on the authority's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a city staff report, 85% of the Orange County Fire Department's 
service area is within cities. The department also provides services for 
unincorporated parts of the county. JEFF BEAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; $100 CHECK BEGINS AMPHITHEATER DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Councilman Wayne L. Peterson is seeking community support to construct an 
amphitheater at Thurston Middle School, which is being partly rebuilt after 
some classrooms were destroyed in the October firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson kicked off the fund-raising effort with a $100 check. An architect, a 
designer and a landscape architect have helped shape early plans for the 
theater, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just charging ahead, although we haven't raised a dime, except for my 
own check," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to speed the process, Peterson is asking residents to join him at the 
site at 5 p.m. today to get involved in the project, which would rely on 
private funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Cheryl Baughn applauded the plan Thursday and said the amphitheater 
could be used for assemblies and plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a very good idea," she said. "It's a very appropriate place for 
it, on the edge of the canyon. It takes advantage of the views and it will add 
to the (landscaping) of the school while still serving a practical purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson said he came up with the idea shortly after the fire when he noticed 
an "unusable" pocket of land behind where the new classrooms will be built. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the land could be excavated, removing five to six feet of earth, 
allowing the installation of a three-tiered, 600-seat amphitheater that would 
feature a grass-covered stage. 
</P>
<P>
 If made part of the rebuilding project, Peterson said, the outdoor theater 
would cost about $50,000, much less than if it were constructed later. 
</P>
<P>
 But the project would have to be funded by Nov. 15, when bids are expected to 
be approved for the larger job, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baughn said that plans for the larger $2.3-million construction project were 
submitted to the state for approval Thursday. She agreed with Peterson that 
timing is important if the theater project is to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 The October firestorm damaged or destroyed more than 400 homes in the Laguna 
Beach area. Thurston, the only school that was burned, lost its main academic 
building with 14 classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The amphitheater project will be discussed at the school board meeting Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents wishing to donate to the project can send money to School Power 
Endowment Fund, Amphitheater, P.O. Box 19, Laguna Beach, Calif. 92652. 
</P>
<P>
 Thurston Middle School is at 2100 Park Ave. Construction Addition If Laguna 
Beach Councilman Wayne L. Peterson has his way, a 600-seat amphitheater will be 
built as part of the firestorm rebuilding taking place on the campus of 
Thurston Middle School. The $50,000 project would be funded from private 
sources.LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TRABUCO CANYON; COURT OKS WORK ON WATER DISTRICT CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An appeals court dismissed a lawsuit this week against Trabuco Canyon Water 
District that sought to stop the construction of a new district operations 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4th District Court of Appeal on Tuesday denied without comment an appeal 
of a lower court decision in July that gave the district the go-ahead to begin 
construction of the two-building, 13,800-square-foot complex in the Trabuco 
Highlands community. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal was made by the Trabuco Highland Community Assn., which opposes the 
project. The 660-home association had contended that the complex is too 
elaborate, is too close to a residential area, and its members were not 
adequately notified of the district's construction plans. 
</P>
<P>
 With the appeal dismissed, grading of the three-acre site began on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of timing and cost issues related to construction, we are now 
proceeding with preliminary site work for the center," said Charles Wall, 
president of the district board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The district serves approximately 4,000 customers in a rural South County area 
contiguous to O'Neill Regional Park and the Cleveland National Forest.LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; 11 TAKE OUT PAPERS FOR COUNCIL 
ELECTION 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eleven people so far have taken out nomination papers for the City Council 
election in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Three council seats are being contested, two of them available because 
incumbents Jeff Vasquez and Gary L. Hausdorfer have publicly announced that 
they will not seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the nine candidates have returned their papers to the city clerk, 
including incumbent Gil Jones and Serge Kohan, who describes himself as a 
salesman with a marketing background. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohan said Wednesday that he plans a grass-roots campaign in which 5,000 to 
6,000 voters will be polled regarding their opinions on four core issues: 
crime, historic preservation, commercial development and immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones has said he wants to make the city more business-friendly while 
continuing with historic preservation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the city clerk's office, others who have taken out nomination 
papers are Philipe Delgado, a chief executive officer and business consultant; 
Robert Hagstrom, a retired military officer; John Greiner, a human resources 
executive and member of the city's Planning Commission; Wyatt Hart, a retired 
Sheriff's Department captain; David Hanson, a pharmacist; Mario Pina, a postal 
carrier; Stan Kensic, a retired police captain; Tim Holsten, a downtown 
business owner; and Tony J. Ionata, a retiree. 
</P>
<P>
 The filing deadline is Aug. 12. If any incumbent whose seat is up for election 
fails to submit papers by then, the deadline will be extended to Aug. 17. AN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; COUNCIL LIMITS TERMS ON 2 COMMISSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council voted unanimously this week to impose term limits on members 
of the Planning Commission and the Parks and Recreation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, which could receive final approval as early as Aug. 15, would 
limit commissioners to no more than three consecutive terms.Each term lasts two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners, who advise council members on local matters, are appointed by 
and serve at the pleasure of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jim Potts, who introduced the measure, said that an influx of new 
commissioners results in fresh perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
 "My idea is that when you get new people in, you get new ideas," he said. 
"There is a burnout factor for being on a committee or a council." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Potts informally called for term limits when he led an 
unsuccessful effort to remove Planning Commissioner Al Baker from his post. 
Baker has served on the advisory panel for the past nine years and has one 
additional year remaining in his term. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Potts in attempting to remove Baker was Councilman Michael J. Doyle. 
However, they were outvoted 3 to 2. Mayor Thomas R. Saltarelli, Councilman 
Jeffery M. Thomas and Councilwoman Tracy Worley all argued that it was unfair 
to remove Baker during the middle of a term. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioners are not the only city officials who may be subject to term 
limits. When voters go to the polls in November, they will decide if term 
limits should be imposed on council members. A council term lasts four years. 
</P>
<P>
 One ballot measure, backed by Potts and Doyle, would prohibit council members 
from serving more than two consecutive terms. A competing measure, favored by 
Saltarelli and Thomas, would limit council members to three consecutive terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley voted to place both of the council-initiated measures on the Nov. 8 
ballot.ALAN EYERLY

COSTA MESA QUICK-PICKER HITS $12.6-MILLION LOTTERY JACKPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAMMY HYUNDJO KRESTA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At just $1 a dream, Joe Spadafore's customers can afford to dream big. 
</P>
<P>
 But for one of his customers, it's no dream. Someone who bought a ticket at 
his store soon can become a multimillionaire by claiming a winning Super Lotto 
ticket worth more than $12.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't it worth a few bucks to dream a little?" Spadafore said of the awaiting 
fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 The unknown winner purchased 10 computerized Quick Pick tickets Tuesday at 4 
p.m. at Bay Crest Spirits and Wine Shop on 17th Street. No one had come forward 
to claim the ticket by Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't win if you don't play," said Spadafore, 40, of Laguna Niguel, 
echoing the Super Lotto motto. 
</P>
<P>
 And he should know. 
</P>
<P>
 Bay Crest Spirits, a 40-year-old liquor store that Spadafore purchased in 
1990, has sold two other winning tickets since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 But this week's jackpot far eclipses the tickets worth $3 million and $6 
million sold in 1989 and 1990, Spadafore said. 
</P>
<P>
 "On real big (jackpot days), it's a big pain in the butt," he said. "We line 
them up outside the door." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest lines were in 1991, when the jackpot soared to $118 million. "They 
knew we'd sold a couple of winners," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people spend an average of $5 on tickets together with a six-pack of 
beer, but "the real hard-core ones spend up to $1,000," he added. "They like to 
gamble, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Spadafore? His limit is $50 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could happen, I guess, but I don't count on it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the slim chance of winning -- one in 18 million -- seems less daunting 
since winners come and go at his store. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the $12-million winning ticket in my hand and I sold it for $10!" he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spadafore said the store was among the top 50 best-selling retailers in the 
state when he bought it in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 There are now about 22,000 retailers selling lottery tickets in California, 
according Bob Taylor, a spokesman for the California lottery. Spadafore's store 
was not among the top 100 sellers as of this year, he said. He did not have 
figures for previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 Each retailer makes 6% of each ticket sold. Last year, ticket sales at 
Spadafore's store grossed $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 On winning tickets, retailers receive one-half of 1% of the total amount won, 
Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bay Crest will receive $63,000 from this week's jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
 If the ticket holder claims the prize within 180 days, he will receive an 
annuity of $454,320 a year after taxes, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having someone come in the first day is unusual," he said. "But if the ticket 
isn't claimed, the money rolls into the California education fund." 
</P>
<P>

EL TORO IS DEEMED BEST OF 5 MILITARY SITES FOR AIRPORT; STUDY: REPORT BACKS FAA 
FINDINGS, WHICH IDENTIFIED THE BASE AS A VIABLE COMMERCIAL FACILITY THAT WOULD 
HAVE MINIMAL IMPACT ON JOHN WAYNE'S PASSENGER BASE. 
</P>

<P>
 The El Toro Marine Corps Air Station is the best existing site in Southern 
California for a new commercial airport of five area military bases scheduled 
to close, but would take little burden off John Wayne Airport if both existed, 
according to a study released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California Assn. of Governments concluded that "El Toro easily 
works best as a commercial airport of all the military bases" but John Wayne 
Airport would still bear the brunt of the demand in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to El Toro, the study also looked at potential airports at Point 
Mugu Naval Weapons Station in Oxnard, March Air Force Base in Riverside County 
and George Air Force Base in San Bernardino County and Norton Air Force Base, 
now called San Bernardino International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the increased passenger travel, an airport at El Toro would bolster 
Orange County's economy by serving as an air cargo facility, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 28% of Southern California's air cargo originates in Orange County, 
"very little of that amount" can be handled at John Wayne Airport, the report 
said. Most cargo is shipped through Los Angeles International Airport, but 
Orange County businesses are forced to deal with early cutoff time for 
overnight deliveries because of congested freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 The new study confirms findings of a 1993 report funded by the Federal 
Aviation Administration, which identified the El Toro base as a "very viable 
commercial airport" that would have minimal impact on John Wayne Airport's 
passenger base. 
</P>
<P>
 However, SCAG excluded the FAA's findings from a report the regional planning 
agency released last year that only addressed the impact that the closures of 
Norton Air Force Base and March Air Force Base would have on existing regional 
airports such as John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to exclude those findings caused a firestorm of controversy from 
those who accused SCAG of playing politics with the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The updated results released Friday, however, did not faze opponents of an El 
Toro airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surprise. Surprise. We've got to give SCAG credit. At least they're 
consistent," said Lake Forest Mayor Marcia Rudolph, who opposes a civilian 
airport at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, the Lake Forest City Council announced it will sue to 
remove an initiative from the November ballot that calls for a commercial 
airport at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the measure is inconsistent with the Orange County General 
Plan, the blueprint for how the county should be developed. 
</P>
<P>
 The SCAG study released Thursday said an airport at El Toro would attract 6.2 
million passengers annually by 2010. But the study also estimated that John 
Wayne would serve 8.4 million passengers annually at the same time, which is 
the maximum amount that airport could handle. 
</P>
<P>
 "John Wayne is better suited to attract demand, since it can serve both 
central and north Orange County, while El Toro would serve primarily south 
Orange County," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the SCAG study also said that both El Toro and John Wayne would still 
lose "a substantial number" of passengers who live in northern Orange County to 
Ontario Airport because it is easier to get to that facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Lonnie Mitchell, spokeswoman for Long Beach Airport, said Long Beach will also 
be competing for passengers from north Orange County and south Los Angeles 
County in the future. The SCAG report did not address the impact that Long 
Beach Airport could have on both El Toro and John Wayne in the competition for 
air passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 The report estimated that Long Beach would serve about 1.4 million passengers 
annually by 2010. Alaska, America West and Sun Jet airlines currently fly out 
of Long Beach Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "North Orange County and south Los Angeles County are definitely markets that 
we want to go after," Mitchell said. "Our biggest selling feature is our 
convenience and close-in parking. It looks like we're going to fit nicely into 
a low-cost niche that's attractive to air travelers." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Partnership 2010 President Tim Cooley said he was encouraged by 
the recent SCAG report. The Orange County group is privately funded and 
develops economic plans for local businesses. It supports a commercial airport 
at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 "An airport at El Toro would give a good jump-start to our local economy and 
take it into the next century," Cooley said. "A 1992 study done for the Los 
Angeles Department of Airports showed that each ton of air cargo is worth 
$10,000 to the local economy and each passenger is worth $500." 
</P>
<P>
 Rudolph said she was not impressed by arguments from proponents who said a 
commercial airport at El Toro is necessary for Orange County's 21st-Century 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This entire report was done with 20th-Century thinking," Rudolph said. "There 
is nothing in it that addresses 21st-Century needs for Orange County."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; ANTI-SMOKING BALLOT MEASURE IS DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The City Council this week dropped an advisory measure on the November ballot 
that would amend the city's smoking ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's 5-0 vote was prompted by Gov. Pete Wilson's signing July 22 of a 
statewide measure that accomplishes many of the same restrictions on smoking in 
public places that the measure addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy I won with the help of the governor," Councilman Henry W. Wedaa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa's proposed ban on smoking in public places, including restaurants and 
all places of employment, has had a roller-coaster ride since the council first 
voted in May to ask residents if they wanted the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, at a meeting Wedaa did not attend, the council voted to remove the 
advisory measure from the ballot and consider a scaled-back version that would 
allow small smoking sections at restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Wedaa persuaded two of his colleagues to put the measure back on 
the ballot. He said an ordinance that allows any smoking in restaurants is not 
sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Wilson signed the new law, Wedaa supported dropping the advisory 
measure from the ballot.  
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Leonard Hampel said the proposed amendment to the city's smoking 
ordinance is similar to the state law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bill is much tougher than most people realize," Hampel said. "It compares 
very favorably to the (proposed) Yorba Linda ordinance." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

 City Council members can no longer charge the city for dry cleaning, 
baby-sitting or vehicle storage. 
</P>
<P>
 The council on Tuesday imposed a revised, pared-down reimbursement policy that 
eliminates all reimbursement except mileage, parking, meals and entertainment 
expenses directly related to the performance of official city duties. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes came after criticism from several residents of Mayor Norman Z. 
Eckenrode's expense reports. Eckenrode was chastised by frequent council 
critics Luci Grismer and Howard Kay for charging the city for newspapers and 
golf outings. 
</P>
<P>
 While Eckenrode defended billing the city more than $300 to play in six golf 
tournaments since 1990 as reimbursement for legitimate city business, he 
requested that the council review the city's reimbursement policy, which 
defined expenses the city would pay for and the procedure for being reimbursed. 
</P>
<P>
 Several council members were surprised they were entitled to bill the city for 
dry cleaning and child care costs stemming from their positions on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "Has anyone actually been using this policy?" asked Councilwoman Maria Moreno. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Robert D'Amato said he could not remember any recent instances of 
council members requesting reimbursement for anything other than meals and 
parking. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

DUMPING AT RESERVATION BLOCKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAUREN STRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of the Torres Martinez band of Desert Cahuilla Indians protested the 
dumping of sludge on their reservation Thursday, carrying picket signs and 
blocking the path of trucks carrying sewage to their community in this rural 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 Private waste management companies truck more than 3,000 tons of solid waste 
to the reservation from Orange and Los Angeles counties each week, dumping it 
on 120 acres they lease from Torres Martinez tribal member Geraldine Ibanez. 
</P>
<P>
 But tribal leaders -- backed by the U.S. Department of the Interior -- have 
ordered the contractors to halt delivery of the sludge, while the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs tries to find ways to dispose of the 470,000 tons of solid waste 
piled five stories high. 
</P>
<P>
 Tribal elder Alec Dominguez, who owns land across the road from the sludge 
heap, says the reservation's water supply has been contaminated and residents' 
health has been jeopardized by the growing pile of manure, which attracts 
hordes of flies and emits enough dust so that children must be kept inside on 
windy days.  
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Mirelez, 12, who spent hours protesting with his mother Thursday, said 
his young cousin had to move from the reservation because she became ill after 
living near the sludge dump. "I would like it just to disappear," he said.

SERVICES SCHEDULED FOR HELEN JOHNSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Funeral services have been finalized for longtime journalist and former UC 
Irvine public relations specialist Helen Johnson, friends said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson died last week of cancer at age 71.A memorial service will be held at 
2 p.m. Wednesday at First Presbyterian Church, 600 N. Main St., Santa Ana.  
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Register employed Johnson from 1948 -- when she arrived from 
her native Pennsylvania -- until 1953. Upon leaving the Register, she joined 
the first corps of reporters at the Los Angeles Times' Orange County operation. 
</P>
<P>
 She directed UCI's public information office from 1969 until 1983, when she 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, Johnson won the Orange County Press Club's Sky Dunlap Award for 
career excellence and contributions to the community. That same year, she 
received UCI's Distinguished Staff member award, the highest accolade given to 
university employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's family members have set up the Helen Johnson Memorial Fund at First 
Presbyterian Church. Donations to the fund -- which will benefit the church -- 
are welcome, said Hilary Kaye, who worked with Johnson at UCI.

MAN SERIOUSLY HURT IN FALL FROM SECOND-STORY WINDOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 21-year-old Huntington Beach man was seriously injured early Thursday when 
he toppled backward out a second-story window, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Todd had been out drinking with friends in Newport Beach on 
Wednesday night, Sgt. Andy Gonis said.After stops at Snug Harbor and 
Margaritaville, Todd purchased beer from a convenience store and returned to a 
friend's second-floor apartment in the 200 block of 33rd Street. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1:45 a.m., Todd "was walking inside the residence and leaned back and 
fell out the window" to the sidewalk below, Gonis said. The window was open, 
and he went through a screen. Tests indicated that Todd was legally drunk, 
Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The young man was taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, where he was 
reported in serious condition, police said.

HONORS MOUNT AS RILEY NEARS END OF SERVICE ON COUNTY BOARD; REMEMBRANCE: 
VETERAN OFFICIAL'S HONESTY, INDUSTRY AND UNFAILING PUBLIC SPIRITEDNESS HAVE 
CREATED LEGIONS OF ADMIRERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM G. STEINER, William G. Steiner is an Orange County Supervisor 
representing the 4th District. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Much has been written and said about the long, distinguished career of Gen. 
Thomas F. Riley, chairman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors. His office 
is filled with awards and remembrances and now, in the final few months of his 
fifth term, his many friends have scheduled one recognition event after another 
to pay their respects to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month, at an 82nd birthday reception in his office, a steady parade 
of secretaries and administrators, community leaders and elected officials, 
former employees and just plain admirers stopped by to wish him well. The 
general, along with Emma Jane, his wife of nearly 56 years, greeted each with a 
genuine sense of appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of us were filled with a sense of nostalgia. So many memories that 
impacted our own individual lives. It seemed impossible to think of the county 
and the Fabulous 5th District, as the General fondly calls it, without his 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 I first met Gen. Riley shortly after I came to Orange County in 1978 to head 
up the Albert Sitton Home, the emergency shelter care facility serving abused 
and neglected children. Even then, I remember how impressed I was with this 
bigger-than-life man with his head of white hair, and square jaw of a retired 
Marine Corps general. Appointed by Gov. Ronald Reagan to the Board of 
Supervisors four years earlier, General Riley was serving as chairman of the 
board during a time of unprecedented crisis for Orange County's victimized 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Child abuse was becoming a national issue and increased numbers of abused and 
neglected children were in need of protective care; yet Albert Sitton Home was 
outmoded and overcrowded. With public funding reduced by the passage of 
Proposition 13, an innovative public-private partnership was needed to fill the 
gap. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Riley took the lead. He encouraged the development of an auxiliary for 
Albert Sitton Home. Out of this grew a tremendous volunteer effort that 
benefited thousands of children over the years. Next, in 1980, the Board of 
Supervisors called together community leaders to challenge them to raise funds 
to construct a new emergency shelter to replace Sitton. Once again, Gen. Riley 
served as a catalyst, bringing divergent interests together, overcoming 
obstacles and making the vision of what was to be Orangewood Children's Home a 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next five years, more than $8 million was raised. The effort was 
handed over to the private sector, with another general, William Lyon, taking 
the lead along with Kathryn G. Thompson and many others who became a powerful 
voice for children who could not easily speak for themselves. Yet through it 
all, Gen. Riley hovered like a concerned parent, quick to come to the rescue 
when the effort could have been derailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Over 15 years in my role as director of Albert Sitton Home and then Orangewood 
Children's Home, and later as director of the Orangewood Children's Foundation, 
I learned that there was a consistent theme in how Gen. Riley is perceived.  
</P>
<P>
 He is a man of his word. He has a strong sense of right and wrong. He believes 
in his duty to God, his country and his fellow man. He is a gentleman, 
thoughtful of others and a champion of those who are less fortunate. He sets a 
pace of a man half his age. He is the first at work in the morning and can 
always be counted on to start a meeting on time. County staff love him. People 
are loyal to him and he returns their loyalty. While he has an occasional 
display of temper he is quick to forgive. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I find myself on the Board of Supervisors, serving with him. Yet for some 
reason I really don't feel like a peer because his stature sets him apart. He 
is the best of the best, a role model. Like a father or kindly grandfather, he 
imparts wisdom. I'm going to miss his leadership on the Board of Supervisors. 
Yet, I hope that in retirement Gen. Riley will have a special ambassador 
status, for I know of no one who could serve the county any better, even as a 
volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 Even better, he should be our supervisor emeritus, for I doubt that there will 
ever be anyone like him again.

SERVICE-SECTOR JOBS GROWTH NO CAUSE FOR CONCERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ESMAEL ADIBI, Esmael Adibi is director of the Center for Economic Research 
at Chapman University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the past 20 years, Orange County's economy has been transformed from a 
bedroom community into a mature and diversified economy. In this process, 
Orange County experienced rapid economic growth and a high level of job 
formation. Total Orange County non-agricultural employment increased from 
474,000 in 1972 to 1.126 million in 1992, an annual average increase of 4.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 The service-producing sector of the economy grew at a much more rapid rate 
than the goods-producing sector over this period. From 1972 to 1992, the 
service-producing sector generated nearly 547,000 jobs, an annual average 
increase of 5.2%. The goods-producing sector, which includes mining, 
construction and manufacturing industries, generated 105,000 jobs, an annual 
average increase of only 2.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 This unbalanced growth has raised some concerns that Orange County's economy 
is being converted from a goods-producing economy into a service-producing one 
and that this trend is not healthy for the economy. This argument is not 
necessarily valid. 
</P>
<P>
 The share of the goods-producing sector of Orange County's economy decreased 
from 34% of total non-agricultural employment in 1972 to 24% in 1992. Several 
factors exacerbated this trend. The 1990-91 recession, which was relatively 
mild and short-lived at the national level, adversely affected Orange County 
for three years and had an especially adverse impact on the construction and 
manufacturing sectors. In addition, defense spending cutbacks caused 
significant job losses. But even if the impact of the recession and the job 
losses derived from corporate downsizing and defense spending cutbacks are 
disregarded, the share of the goods-producing sector of the economy was already 
shrinking over time and this should not be surprising. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 First, the goods-producing sector, particularly manufacturing, is more 
receptive to adopting advanced technological changes than the service-producing 
sector. Consequently, labor productivity in the goods-producing sector grows 
faster than the rest of the economy. As a result, increases in demand for 
manufactured goods are being satisfied mostly by improvement in productivity 
rather than the increase in employment. Secondly, the service-producing sector 
is typically labor-intensive operations where higher demand could mostly be 
satisfied by an increase in employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the rapid growth of the service-producing sector of Orange County has 
been in response to increasing population. A large quantity of manufactured 
goods is exported to other parts of the country and abroad. Output of the 
service-producing sector, however, is produced mainly for the region's 
consumption. Indeed, as the population of Orange County grew, employment in 
retail trade, services, real estate, public utilities and transportation, and 
local government experienced rapid growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Is anything wrong with a region's economy if the concentration of jobs is in 
the non-goods producing sectors? The conventional argument is that 
manufacturing jobs are typically higher paid than other jobs, and the increase 
in non-manufacturing jobs at the expense of manufacturing jobs will hinder the 
region's income growth. But in Orange County, the average hourly wage in the 
manufacturing sector in 1992 was $12.21, only 28 cents more than the 
service-producing sector. Contrary to common belief, service jobs are no longer 
limited to flipping hamburgers or washing cars. The quality of service jobs has 
steadily improved. Continuous increases in demand for data processing, 
telecommunications, financial, legal and health care services have induced a 
rapid growth in jobs that require a high level of skills and training, and pay 
relatively high salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 No one can really predetermine an optimal mix of goods-producing and 
service-producing industries. At higher stages of economic development and 
growth, non-manufacturing jobs are expected to grow at a faster rate. In the 
process, firms will constantly consider expanding, relocating and shutting down 
operations in response to the economic environment, and this is as it should be 
in a free market system.

AROUND TOWN: PREACHER BELTS 'EM OUT FOR THE LORD

 The pastor -- tall and dapper in a double-breasted white suit -- stands before 
his flock and intones, "Praise the Lord . . . are you all as nervous as I am?" 
</P>
<P>
 Not your usual message from the pulpit, but the Rev. Cheviene Jones is no 
ordinary preacher. He's here this Sunday afternoon at Bethel AME Church in 
South-Central to sing and dance. In the name of the Lord, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 The congregation is accustomed to hearing its pastor talk to them about many 
things -- the importance of approaching life with a plan, why talent must go 
hand in hand with discipline, the issue of friendship in the context of O.J. 
Simpson and Al Cowlings. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is not a church service. It is a concert. The pastor, who was once a 
professional musician, is performing to raise money for the church and its 
people projects. 
</P>
<P>
 It's standing room only, not an empty seat among 800. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sing, shout, clap, stomp, praise the Lord as you see fit," entreats program 
co-chair Clarence Bush, one of the warm-up acts. He needn't have urged. 
</P>
<P>
 The pastor, it can safely be said, has charisma. He wows them with "The Lord's 
Prayer," delivered in a voice that flirts with tenor, bass and baritone over a 
range of two-plus octaves, building to a booming "Amen." 
</P>
<P>
 To thunderous applause, he sings "Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child." 
He brings some to their feet with "The Savior Lives in You," which, he notes, 
is "the gospel according to Jones." 
</P>
<P>
 He's really warming up now, dancing in place, high-kicking, clapping. "Is 
everything all right?" It is. "Praise the Lord." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, 52, is no stranger to show business. He used to be in it. Indeed, he 
once played bass guitar on the Playboy Club circuit. Then, in 1974, a messenger 
appeared to him in winged helmet and beckoned him to serve God. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones answered: "No way, no way." 
</P>
<P>
 About six months later, he heard the Lord's voice. The message was ominous, 
Jones recalls: "If I didn't preach, he had no reason to keep me here." 
</P>
<P>
 So he packed up his guitar and enrolled at Interdenominational Theological 
Center in Atlanta, where he might just have been the first student with a 
bachelor's degree in mathematics, a series of underground club gigs, a stint as 
an engineer -- and a French chef's name. 
</P>
<P>
 He explains the name: His father, a chef before becoming a pastor, worked with 
a chef Cheviene (pronounced sheVEEN) at Radium Springs, Ga., a resort "where 
rich people would come in the '20s and '30s." 
</P>
<P>
 At 5, little Cheviene was singing in church, in a voice he believes was "a 
gift of God." At Morris Brown College in Atlanta, where he minored in music, 
Coretta Scott King helped hone that gift. 
</P>
<P>
 But, on graduation, Jones the pragmatist signed on as an engineer with Western 
Electric, which made Ma Bell's telephones. "So boring," he says, "so 
predictable." After eight years, music was on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like Cannonball Adderley told me I could play," says Jones, who 
reckons he became "pretty good." First, with a funky rock group called the 
Kickers and the Pickers, later with a jazz septet, the Prime Ministers, then 
with the Chevy Jones Trio. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came that fateful messenger. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, he'd never considered the ministry. As the eldest of five children 
of a preacher, he'd learned that "people hold the pastor and his family to a 
higher standard than they hold themselves. They want to put you in a glass 
house. They forget that their house is also made of glass." 
</P>
<P>
 As his father moved from church to church, city to city, Jones had always been 
"the new kid on the block," the perpetual outsider. 
</P>
<P>
 But throughout his life he accumulated experiences that would serve him well 
after he accepted his calling to do the Lord's work: The racial prejudice of 
the old South, which made him motivated and disciplined; his civil rights 
activism with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and, of course, 
five years as a musician. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Jones: "I have a tendency not to be as judgmental as some people who 
spent all their time in the church. . . . I try to be compassionate, having 
lived on the other side of the track. I never was a drug addict, but I was 
around them. I was around pimps and prostitutes . . . I was around people who 
did contract killings." 
</P>
<P>
 He enjoys calling himself "a country boy from Georgia," but his flock isn't 
fooled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, honey, he is terrific," says Lucille Harris, who joined Bethel AME in 
1963. "A wonderful minister. The best we've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 The pastor's dollars-and-cents savvy isn't lost on her, either. (His credits 
include graduate studies in business administration). Soon after arriving as 
pastor 22 months ago, he did the first fund-raising concert, raising about 
$12,000 for college scholarships and youth- and family-oriented church 
programs. Last Sunday's concert, with admission by donation, brought in about 
$14,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "A gifted man, multitalented," says Joseph Moss of the Men of Bethel. Moss 
sees nothing bizarre about having his pastor up there singing and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not show business," he says. "This is still church. Even though it's 
singing, it's still singing about the Lord." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yes, one other thing: At theology school, Jones focused on Old Testament 
studies (he is fluent in Hebrew) and has spent years researching an exposition 
of passages from the Old and New Testaments for a book, due out in the fall. 
It's titled "Uncovering the Ark of the Covenant." 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, he also belts out a mean "Old Time Religion." Tarot, Magic and 
Mambo Gumbo 
</P>
<P>
 Hi. My name's Jonathan and I'll be your magician tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 And my name's Zigee. I'll be your fortune teller. 
</P>
<P>
 We're at the Cha Cha Cha in Encino where, on Sunday evenings, sleight of hand 
and tarot card readings are served up free with the Caribbean cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 Tableside, magician Jonathan Matthews fashions a swan from a $20 bill and 
makes it gyrate in mid-air, defying gravity. Surely there's a Mexican jumping 
bean inside? A Caribbean black bean? 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews just smiles and says, "I can also make checks bounce." 
</P>
<P>
 His bag of tricks includes cards, coins and tableware that appear or disappear 
at the flick of a wrist, balls that reproduce like rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
 Watch him tell you which card you've drawn. The cards aren't marked, he 
explains: "They just look that way," splashed with jerk chicken or mambo gumbo. 
</P>
<P>
 Performing up-close-and-personal is different from being in a theater where 
"if someone whispers to his wife, 'I think she's in the box,' it's not going to 
ruin the whole show." Doctors and lawyers are easiest to fool, he's found -- 
too analytical.  
</P>
<P>
 Matthews can sense which tables to avoid. And he never interrupts anyone 
mid-meal. A patron's had a few drinks? All the better. "I can say it's an 
iguana in my hand and they'll believe me." 
</P>
<P>
 More than once, he's played Cupid, making engagement rings appear during 
romantic dinners a deux .  
</P>
<P>
 As Zigee sets out her crystal ball at a corner table, a hostess goes table to 
table, giving numbers to those who wish a reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Zigee is beguiling in a Bo Peep-meets-the-gypsy outfit that is "part 
Hungarian, part Spanish, part Neiman Marcus." And zee accent ? It "comes when I 
put on the costume." OK, she was born Jillian Gotlib in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm known as the good gypsy," Zigee says. "I only give uplifting information, 
something people can use, that's not going to scare them." She doesn't call 
herself a psychic, preferring to use her gift to guide. For example? "To teach 
men to stay romantic with the woman in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Rings glitter on five fingers of the hands that hold the tarot cards. Zigee 
smiles enigmatically: "It's a very good omen to lose a ring to a gypsy. 
Already, I've made five clients very happy." 
</P>
<P>
 The magician and the psychic are a big draw, say owners Lee and Norma Laine: 
"Everyone does music. Music is mundane." 
</P>
<P>
 One diner did protest that Zigee was "the devil." But, Lee noticed, she 
finished dinner before leaving in a huff.

TRIBUTE TO A CREATIVE PAST; IN A TIME OF VIOLENCE AND MADNESS, QUARTET WEST 
PAYS HOMAGE TO THE MID-'40S WITH TUNES OF ROMANCE AND BEAUTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Charlie Haden, the renowned jazz bassist and bandleader, rhapsodizes about the 
City of the Angels of the mid-'40s. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was such a creative period," says Haden, a Malibu resident. He was 
sipping cappuccino in a Santa Monica coffeehouse a day after he returned from a 
European tour by the Liberation Music Orchestra, which he has led since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pop music was so great then, and it sold millions of copies," he goes on. 
"And there were great writers, like Raymond Chandler, and film directors. 
Actors and actresses like Humphrey Bogart and John Garfield and Lauren Bacall 
and Ann Baxter. And the soundtrack composers: Max Steiner, Victor Young, Hugo 
Friedhofer, Dimitri Tiomkin." 
</P>
<P>
 Haden, who turns 57 Saturday, says he gets to revisit that period in a 
personal way through his primary band, Quartet West. "The quartet is my way to 
fantasize about the time," he says. "It's like dreaming, not only when I'm 
asleep, but when I'm awake." 
</P>
<P>
 Quartet West, which plays the Hollywood Bowl on Wednesday, was formed in 1986. 
The foursome is composed of Haden, Ernie Watts (tenor sax), Alan Broadbent 
(piano) and Larance Marable (drums), who replaced original drummer Billy 
Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's last two Verve Records albums, "Haunted Heart" and "Always Say 
Goodbye," pay particular tribute to the past. On "Haunted Heart," Haden 
included snippets of Jo Stafford's original 1947 version of the title tune, 
which follows Quartet West's instrumental interpretation of the Arthur 
Schwartz-Howard Dietz standard. The band also offers such period pieces as 
David Raksin's "The Bad and the Beautiful" and Charlie Parker's "Segment." 
</P>
<P>
 "Always Say Goodbye," released earlier this year, takes Haden's concept a step 
further, since he opens and closes the album with spoken dialogue from the 1946 
classic film "The Big Sleep," which starred Bogart and Bacall. The album 
includes more selections from past decades, among them Raksin's "My Love and I" 
(from the film, "Apache") and the standard "Everything Happens to Me," as well 
as originals by Haden and Broadbent that evoke the era. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, this music has a lush, appealing quality that mixes vibrant melodies 
with pulsating swing, and that's just what Haden intended. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to play songs that are about romance and beauty," he says. 
"There's so much violence and madness in the world now that I think people need 
to be exposed to as much beauty as possible. The point is to touch peoples' 
lives with beauty so that it will create inspiration inside them." 
</P>
<P>
 Haden says beauty and meaning are at the core of jazz. "Jazz is a very special 
art form, and if people are exposed to it, and allow themselves to be touched 
by it, the music has a very positive effect. It can enhance your life." 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz does not get its due, Haden says. Usually it's played in clubs -- an 
atmosphere that he disdains. Jazz belongs in the concert halls, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't played in a club in quite a while, and that makes me happy," he 
says. "There's too many people smoking, talking. There are things going on that 
have nothing to do with the music. Jazz should be looked on at an equal level 
with classical music, and should be presented in beautiful concert halls with 
wonderful acoustic systems." 
</P>
<P>
 Haden has had a thriving career in jazz for more than 30 years. A native of 
Shenandoah, Iowa, at 2 years old he was singing country music in his family's 
touring band, and at 15 discovered jazz. He reached international status at 22, 
when he played bass with free-thinking saxophonist Ornette Coleman's 
ground-breaking quartet. 
</P>
<P>
 Haden has played on more than 400 albums, with everyone from Pat Metheny to 
Keith Jarrett, and is regarded as one of jazz's premier practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Haden has been one of the most restless, gifted and intrepid players in all 
of jazz," wrote Jay Cocks in Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching people who are new to jazz and to his music thrills him, Haden says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone told me that Lauren Bacall heard 'Always Say Goodbye' at a wrap party 
for a film she did with Robert Altman in Paris, and said she wanted to go out 
and get the album," he says. "That kind of thing knocks me out." WHERE AND WHEN

THREE ASPECTS OF WOMAN; 'THE TRIUMPH OF MAEVE' TRACES RELATIONSHIP OF TWO IRISH 
SISTERS AND THEIR TRADITIONALIST MOTHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Robert Koehler writes frequently about 
theater for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ah, the power of three. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christian Trinity. The Three Kings. The three-headed serpents of 
mythology. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, meet the threesome of Constance, Eva and Lady Gore-Booth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realize that they are the three aspects of woman," says playwright-actor 
Victoria Thompson of her new drama, "The Triumph of Maeve," playing at Theatre 
East. 
</P>
<P>
 A drama, incidentally, in three acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson has fashioned that rare creation in American theater: a genuine 
history play, and one with an agenda, albeit an ever-changing one. "Maeve" 
traces the mercurial relationship, from 1899 to 1917, of Irish poet and 
pacifist Eva Gore-Booth, her sister Countess Constance Markiewicz (who helped 
spur the 1916 Irish Easter Rebellion and was the first woman elected to the 
British House of Commons) and their traditionalist mother, Lady Georgina 
Gore-Booth. It is a triangle that bursts the bonds of 19th-Century domestic 
tranquillity -- as if the shuttered characters of Choderlos de Laclos had 
suddenly been dropped into the turmoil of Stendhal's "The Red and the Black." 
</P>
<P>
 The play's shifts between the drawing room of the Gore-Booth family's Irish 
estate of Lissadell and the tense, revolutionary atmosphere of Dublin recall 
Leo Tolstoy's "War and Peace." Not surprisingly, Thompson's most recent theater 
work was a dramatization of letters exchanged between Tolstoy and his wife, 
Sonya, "and I began writing 'Triumph of Maeve' based on Constance's letters to 
Eva," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, though, Thompson had accidentally landed upon this fiery Irish 
family during a trip to Ireland with her husband, T.S. Kerrigan and their three 
children. Kerrigan ("a huge fan of Yeats") was searching for his family roots 
in County Sligo, and the locals urged them to visit Lissadell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in Ireland seems to know about the countess," says Thompson, sitting 
next to director-actor Elaine Welton Hill in a rehearsal room across from the 
theater's main stage. "It's as if she were still alive (she died in 1927), with 
people taking strong pro and con positions on her radical methods to gain 
independence from England. But because I've always been somewhat of a 
nonviolent pacifist myself, I felt close to Eva, who seemed pure and good and 
almost saintly." 
</P>
<P>
 The epistolary draft of the play didn't work, but it did begin a two-year 
process of rewrites, rehearsals and workshop readings, and as it went, Thompson 
says she felt closer to Constance, "as a woman of action." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the current production is modest, with period costumes and furniture 
but no set, Thompson and Hill don't hide the hope that a well-endowed theater 
will snatch it up for a larger production. When asked how many drafts she went 
through to get to the current edition, Thompson places her hand palm-side down 
in midair, about two feet above the floor: "The stack of paper is this high. 
The dead trees! Folks here started calling it 'The Sligo Cycle,' " after the 
Pulitzer-winning, seven-hour "The Kentucky Cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, Hill and two fellow Theatre East actors (Eve Brenner as Lady 
Gore-Booth and George Clifton as Constance's husband Count Casimir) have been 
with the play since its first workshop birth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The one casting mishap, ironically, appears to have been a boon for "Maeve." 
Nan McNamara took over as Eva when Thompson's actor sister, Hilarie Thompson, 
departed. "We still need to talk about why she didn't want to play Eva," the 
playwright said. "We haven't spoken since Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "But as painful as our rift has been, it's shed a whole new light on 
sister-sister relationships for me, and it provided the catalyst for the drama. 
Before this, when we were in workshops, and Theatre East members sitting in 
would ask me what the play was about, I couldn't really answer them. Now, I 
know." 
</P>
<P>
 The Constance-Eva faceoff represents a kind of ongoing Shavian debate within 
the play, as the maturing feminists arrive at opposed positions for their 
shared goal of human liberation. They are more than women's suffragists; 
Thompson shows how Constance moved from being a dilettante painter to feminist 
agitator to political revolutionary, and how Eva evolved from private poet to 
active pacifist during World War I -- an unpopular position among suffragists. 
</P>
<P>
 Lady Gore-Booth, meanwhile, sits on the sidelines, Yesterday's Woman wondering 
if the world is spinning out of control. "She has her say in the end, and it is 
a kind of liberation for her as well," Thompson says. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomorrow's Woman is represented by Constance's daughter, Maeve (played by 
Thompson's own daughter, Hilary Kerrigan), who is named for the ancient Irish 
Queen of Connacht and a matron saint of Irish feminism. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill acknowledges that as part of the "Maeve" core group for two years, she 
feels attached to the play. "It has so many large, epic themes -- God, country, 
sisterhood, justice, betrayal, loyalty, revolution, art -- that it was 
sometimes all-consuming considering it during rehearsals. And we've had such 
dissensions over it. The men here keep saying that the male characters are 
written as weak fobs, as if it's reverse-sexism. But this play is about strong 
women who happen to live in a world they personally share with weak men." 
</P>
<P>
 The men attending the workshop readings have even wondered why Thompson 
refuses to show any sexuality between Eva and her companion, Esther (played by 
Hill). Again, the director and author says, it's a case of men not getting it: 
"These women were a mutual aid," Thompson says, "true friends and support 
during a time when women had only two options -- marriage and spinsterhood. Eva 
and Esther chose a third, and even in 1994, it's still a puzzle to some." Where

THEATER REVIEW; 'SHREW' CARRIES BIG SCHTICK; THE COMEDY SUCCEEDS IN EXCALIBUR'S 
TAKE ON SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY. KATE IS FRESH AND FLIP. BUT PETRUCHIO IS MUCH ADO 
ABOUT NOTHING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Excalibur Theatre Company's production of Shakespeare's "The Taming of the 
Shrew," at the Lionstar Theatre, isn't the first time the play has been treated 
as commedia dell'arte. It's an obvious choice because of the simplicity of the 
plot, the colorful flights of humor and the play's tendency to poke fun at 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Thomas W. Ashworth's decision to make some of the action and dialogue 
slightly anachronistic and to give most of the characters masks has also been 
done before. When Petruchio meets the aging Vincentio while taking his newly 
tamed Kate back to Padua for a visit, calling their broom-handle horses Rameses 
and Trojan gets its laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 So do Petruchio's servants, spinning and colliding like Keystone Cops. So do 
the many bits of vaudeville shtick that Ashworth has tossed in with abandon. 
</P>
<P>
 But the core of any production of the play rests solely on its Kate and its 
Petruchio. 
</P>
<P>
 This staging's Kate, Tally Briggs, is intriguingly volatile in a modern mode, 
fresh and flip, a Valley virago who easily maneuvers the lady's gradual 
domestication without the subservience that usually upsets feminists. 
</P>
<P>
 Briggs' Kate delivers her final speech on a wife's duty with a solid sense 
that she's still boss, though working in the system of her time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carl J. Pfeifer's Petruchio is properly brash and grinning, as swashbuckling 
as any, but he doesn't seem to have found a center for his characterization. 
Maybe it's his habit of checking out the audience every once in a while that 
breaks his concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's an idea that male swagger is enough. The result is a Petruchio that 
is much ado about nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 The supporting actors are successful in ratio to their understanding of 
Ashworth's commedia concept, and their ability to amplify it. Ashworth himself 
is best at this in his performance as the deceptive Tranio, now grand above his 
station as Lucentio's servant, now camp when disguised as his master and 
entreating for the hand of Kate's sister Bianca. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Leslie's Grumio, servant to Petruchio, is a solid piece of comic 
acting, but Leslie could multiply his effects somewhat without overstepping his 
director's framework. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelie McIver's Bianca is very strong, not as meek as often played, but 
obviously Kate's sister with a smoother edge, and Archie Lee Simpson's father, 
Baptista, stands out for his ability to make the verse sound as though it has 
never been spoken before, and a comic flair that is subtle but true. 
</P>
<P>
 Played out commedia style on a bare stage, this "Shrew" is pleasant to look at 
because of A. Jeffrey Schoenberg's splashy and attractive costumes, and in 
spite of the conceit of Sugano's masks, which neither hinder nor help the 
production. Where and When

 If there's an added note of excitement or pride in Gino's voice, it's perhaps 
fueled by the evidence here of the gallery's rich history. "There is so much 
good art out here in California that doesn't get the proper attention," says 
Gino, 65. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orlando Gallery has dedicated itself to giving California artists that 
kind of attention since 1958. Beginning today, the gallery presents a sampling 
of its legacy in a retrospective show that travels from pop art to traditional 
figurative painting, from abstract works to conceptual art, and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may have never got started if we didn't give them their first chance," 
he says of the emerging artists the gallery has introduced over the decades. 
"They may have never had the courage to go out and fight the world of art." 
</P>
<P>
 Gino says he expects to show more than 100 pieces in the show, officially 
titled "Orlando Gallery Collection, from 1960 to 1989," which continues through 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the works in the exhibition will be Susan Clover's paintings of seaside 
realism, and Gary Miner's conceptual art "kits" from the early 1970s. In one of 
those humorous works, the "Laguna Beach Sunset Sculpture Kit" offers prepared 
and sealed packets of sand, shells and a painted sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 One painting by Michael Lloyd is a large canvas of deep blues, mixing precise 
geometric squares with abstract splashes of paint. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was done over 20 years ago," Gino says of the painting. "It's a 
magnificent work. This is why I'm showing the collection. Some of this stuff I 
was showing in the '50s and '60s and '70s are just as avant-garde in the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Grant, the 40-year-old nephew of the late Orlando, and now a partner in 
the gallery, added: "What's great is to watch them grow." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, several of the gallery's artists have moved on to greater 
notoriety, including photographer Judy Fiskin, who was the subject of a solo 
show last year at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. The Orlando 
Gallery was showing Fiskin's small photographs back in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gino acknowledges that it was sometimes a struggle to introduce 
contemporary art, particularly by little-known California-based artists, in the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 When the gallery opened at its first location in Encino in the late 1950s, the 
Ventura Freeway didn't exist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Gino and Orlando, both artists themselves, were determined to carve an 
identity far from the established Los Angeles gallery scene on the west side of 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think art should be in one designated area," Gino says. "It's for the 
masses. How can you pin it down and say this is the only place you can go and 
see art. People should go to it and see it." 
</P>
<P>
 To keep the gallery alive during the early days, Gino took two outside jobs. 
Orlando also worked another job, and at one point the gallery was selling 
certain paintings for as little as $5. "We didn't make any money off the 
gallery" throughout the 1960s, Gino says, though things finally turned around 
in the 1970s at the Sherman Oaks location, where the Orlando Gallery has been 
for the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some people who are not afraid to explore and express themselves, 
and they buy art more now than they used to," Gino says. "Especially younger 
people. I find the younger generation enjoys it so much." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, other galleries have come and gone in the Valley, some of them in 
the very same neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Financially it's difficult," Gino says. "I have learned to do without to 
survive. But I love art. It's important to me. If I had to go out and get 
another job, I'd go do it." Where and When

IMAGES OF LUCK AND LIFE; A MOTHER AND DAUGHTER JOIN CREATIVE FORCES IN AN 
EXHIBITION OF THEIR INTRICATE JAPANESE ORIGAMI ARTWORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The ancient Japanese art of origami is more than a hobby, a way to pass some 
time. It has lasting emotional power, says artist and singer Michie Sahara. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider, she says, the story of the "Thousand Cranes," which emerged from the 
days after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 A young girl stricken with radiation disease was told she would survive if she 
folded 1,000 cranes from paper. She died before she could finish the delicate 
task, Sahara says, "and all the little girls from all over Japan sent cranes to 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 There now stands in Hiroshima a statue of the girl surrounded by 1,000 of the 
elegant birds, and many in Japan still bring paper cranes to weddings and 
anniversaries for luck, Sahara says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crane brings good luck, long life," she says. "It's the most beautiful, 
gorgeous bird. It's been the subject of origami for over 200 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Sahara and her mother, artist and pianist Masako Sakai, emigrated from Tokyo 
in the late 1960s and have since found their own luck with cranes. 
</P>
<P>
 Their own origami works are on exhibition through August at the Sumitomo Bank 
in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Their work combines centuries-old traditions of the form mastered by Sakai, 
combined with new ways of presenting them created by Sahara. 
</P>
<P>
 Their origami is included in the collections of the Pacific Asia Museum in 
Pasadena and the Mingei International Museum in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
 "People normally cut origami and that's it," Sahara says of the works folded 
from hand-painted rice paper. "They don't mount it or anything. We wanted to 
make a finished presentation. So we come up with different things." 
</P>
<P>
 Their "Thousand Cranes," for example, are not bundled loosely together, as is 
customary. Instead, their 1,000 birds of reds, blues, greens and yellows hang 
toward the floor in neat rows from a bamboo rod. 
</P>
<P>
 In a work titled "Rainforest," a square blue canvas depicts the Amazon, with 
gold and silver cords to represent rainfall, as 100 small connected cranes 
gather around a mother figure nearby. "We can't get bigger than that, unless 
somebody makes us some bigger paper." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The source material for these works are the 200-year-old designs created by 
Rokoan, a Buddhist priest, who wrote poetry to accompany his origami. 
</P>
<P>
 Those 49 designs were discovered in an old Japanese book 15 years ago by 
Sakai, who had never before had a lesson in origami. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those models had as many as 100 individual, connected cranes within 
them, created entirely from one sheet of paper from precise incisions, and no 
glue. 
</P>
<P>
 Sakai ultimately mastered all 49 models, becoming one of a very small number 
able to create 100 cranes from a single sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are maybe 20 people who can do 100 cranes," says Sahara, a professional 
singer of jazz-pop standards. She lives with her mother in North Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
 "My mother and I think of these things together," she says. "I think of the 
background, and visualize it and tell her. And my mother says she thinks she 
can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 At the bank, the 22 works are scattered along the walls, with the delicate 
cranes exposed on the varied canvases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought of putting plexiglass over it," Sahara says. "But it was too 
expensive, and origami was originally supposed to be as is . When you enclose 
it in something it looks dead. My mother likes the bird to be alive." 
</P>
<P>
 In that way, the mother and daughter are traditionalists in origami. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, where origami is now enjoying renewed respect as an art after years 
of being taken for granted, some are folding paper into such new designs as 
dinosaurs, pandas, crabs and miscellaneous geometrical patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 Sahara says her mother never dreamed origami would ever get this much 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Japan (some) people . . . think it is just a little hobby to just pass 
time. But she loves doing it." Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: Origami works by Masako Sakai and Michie Sahara.

ENTERTAINMENT NEWS; BANK ON THIS SINGER; YOU CAN EXPECT SOME REAL HONKY-TONK 
SOUNDS WHEN JOHNNY PAYCHECK ARRIVES AT COWBOY PALACE SALOON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES E. FOWLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Country singer Johnny Paycheck's name almost became a household word in the 
1970s when his working-class anthem, "Take This Job and Shove It," rose to No. 
1 on the country-Western charts. The song, which touched a chord with America's 
wage earners, even inspired a movie.  
</P>
<P>
 Then came the '80s, which were not as kind to Paycheck. He battled the law, 
the IRS and his own excesses. But now he's on the comeback trail, and this 
month that trail winds through Chatsworth. He will perform two shows Aug. 18 at 
the Cowboy Palace Saloon, singing his hits and new material. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paycheck is a natural for a honky-tonk," Cowboy Palace owner Bob Rustigian 
said. "His songs fit our place." 
</P>
<P>
 Paycheck, with a hell-raising image and a repertoire that chronicles the life 
and times of America's working and drinking class, certainly does fit the image 
of the Cowboy Palace, which bills itself as the "Last Real Honky-Tonk." 
</P>
<P>
 His songs, including "I'm the Only Hell My Mama Ever Raised," "Pardon Me, I've 
Got Someone to Kill" and "Colorado Kool-Aid" reflect a steamier side of 
American tavern life. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a two-year prison stay resulting from a 1985 barroom shooting, 
Paycheck himself has been singing a somewhat different tune, extolling the joys 
of an alcohol- and drug-free life: The music remains the same, but the man says 
he is completely drug-, alcohol- and nicotine-free.  
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboy Palace, under several different names and owners, has been a 
fixture in the San Fernando Valley country music scene for almost 20 years. 
Although badly damaged in the Northridge earthquake, the club reopened after 
about three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Rustigian says he's looking at Aug. 18 as a test. Although he has no other 
similar concerts scheduled, he thinks that local country-Western fans will 
enjoy seeing recording artists in a club setting, and would like to create a 
regular series. 
</P>
<P>
 Paycheck, for his part, will be upfront and personal, signing autographs 
before each show.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's an intimate setting," Rustigian said. "You can even dance to his 
(Paycheck's) music." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Paycheck will perform two shows, at 9 and 11 p.m., Aug. 18 at the 
Cowboy Palace Saloon, 21635 Devonshire Blvd., Chatsworth. Tickets are $15 for 
each show, and $25 for both. Call (818) 341-0166.

 ONE OF THE GANG: The Rev. D. Kenneth Smith of Tujunga is viewing today's 
opening of Steven Spielberg's remake of "The Little Rascals" a little 
differently than most people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seventh-day Adventist minister portrayed the bookish Waldo in the original 
cast of the "Our Gang" comedy shorts in the 1930s and '40s. The comedies were 
later repackaged for television with the new name "The Little Rascals." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I'll be interested in seeing it," Smith said.  
</P>
<P>
 By the time Smith was 15, he had appeared in more than 50 films. He made his 
movie debut in "The Plot Thickens" (1936). During his film career, he worked 
with such stars as Lucille Ball, ZaSu Pitts and John Barrymore. He appeared in 
22 "Our Gang" episodes along with Spanky, Alfalfa, Buckwheat, Froggy and the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 But by age 15, Smith decided that an acting career was incompatible with his 
new religion. He was baptized that year at a Seventh-day Adventist evangelist 
meeting in North Hollywood, and he quit acting. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith didn't see any of his fellow cast members again until a 1986 reunion in 
Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith served as pastor at Seventh-day Adventist churches in Escondido, 
Fallbrook and Oceanside, then did missionary work in Thailand for 17 years. 
More recently, he was pastor at the La Crescenta and Sunland-Tujunga 
Seventh-day Adventist churches. Now in semi-retirement, Smith serves as an 
associate pastor at the Norwalk Seventh-day Adventist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he has tapes of a few of his films, and that when any of his nine 
grandchildren come to his house in Tujunga, they watch the "Little Rascals" 
over and over again. Smith admits that he still enjoys seeing himself on the 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I chose a different path," Smith said. "But, it's been a very rewarding life. 
I don't regret it, but those years were fun." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Little Rascals," produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment and 
directed by Penelope Spheeris, opens at theaters nationwide today.

COVER STORY; SUPER SELECTION; AS INTEREST IN COMIC BOOKS HAS INCREASED, SO HAS 
THE NUMBER OF STORES SELLING THEM. THE VALLEY IS HOME TO MORE THAN TWO DOZEN, 
MANY OF WHICH OFFER DISCOUNTS, SALES AND MEMBERSHIPS TO ATTRACT REPEAT 
BUSINESS.

 Comic books are big business these days. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 * A Sotheby's auction of rare comic art in New York brought in a record $1.7 
million in June, with the first comic book appearances of Superman and Batman 
fetching nearly $55,000 and $49,000, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 * According to Jesse Leon McCann, customer service representative for Diamond 
Comic Distributors' Los Angeles outlet, a staggering 600 to 800 individual 
comic book titles are published each month. 
</P>
<P>
 * And today through Sunday, tens of thousands of fans will converge on the San 
Diego Comic Con, one of the nation's largest annual comic book conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no surprise, then, that as interest in comics has increased, so have the 
number of stores that sell them. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Over 50 Years of American Comic Books," writer Ron Goulart notes that 
although comic books had been sold for many years through the head shops and 
used record stores of the 1960s and '70s counterculture, stores devoted to 
comics didn't appear in significant numbers until the mid-1970s, when retailers 
were able to bypass wholesalers and deal directly with publishers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it looks like every time you turn around, there's a comic book store," 
says lifelong comics reader Todd Chodorow, 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the San Fernando Valley is home to more than two dozen shops devoted to 
comics and related merchandise -- a competition that has inspired many stores 
to offer discounts, sales and memberships to attract repeat business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the service that's going to sell you on a place," Chodorow says. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite comics' growing market and the proliferation of "mature" -- the 
comic book equivalent of an R rating -- and pornographic titles, some argue 
that much of the industry's output remains rooted in timeworn formulas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market has gotten really, really big," says Joe Masset of Forbidden 
Planet in Sherman Oaks. "It just hasn't gotten all that broad. Comic book 
publishers are still trying to sell superhero books." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, despite the explosion of titles and publishers over the last few 
years, most comics still star costumed superheroes and comic readers remain 
largely male. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of women don't like (comics) because of the way women are portrayed," 
says Rosa Thwett, co-owner of Comic Asylum in West Hills. The opinion is shared 
by most retailers, who note that women generally account for only a fraction of 
their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 There are exceptions, such as 24-year-old Lisa Nelson of Glendale, who spends 
nearly $30 a week on Japanese animation videos and Japanese comics, known as 
manga. According to Nelson, the science fiction-heavy Japanese comics tend to 
feature stronger women. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, the female characters in American comic books are just kind of 
hokey," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, comics are evolving, and so are the stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's because the audience has changed," McCann says. "The way comic book 
stores have changed is the way that readers have changed." 
</P>
<P>
 No longer the domain of the after-school crowd, today's comic book store draws 
everyone from preteen "Spider-Man" and "Batman" readers to adults lured by 
moody, sophisticated titles such as DC Comics' "Sandman." 
</P>
<P>
 In response, many retailers have expanded their merchandise beyond the typical 
$2 comic book to include T-shirts, posters, model kits, trading cards and 
graphic novels -- softcover books with original and reprinted comics material. 
And while many shop owners see them as a passing fad, most are now carrying 
Pogs, those whackable discs that have gripped the grade-school crowd.  
</P>
<P>
 Says Charles Pira of Pee Wee Comics: "I don't think a store can survive just 
on comics nowadays." 
</P>
<P>
 The following is a non-inclusive list of Valley comic book shops, from 
successful veterans to lesser-known newcomers, with an emphasis on the products 
and services that make each unique. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * The Art of Collecting, 6100 Laurel Canyon Blvd., at the Laurel Plaza Mall, 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 When an earthquake shuts your doors for two months, what do you do? Conduct 
business in the parking lot! And so it went for this shop, located on the 
outside of the quake-battered mall. The store is open again, but the mall 
remains closed, its future cloudy. Employee David Wilhite, 27, says Laurel 
Plaza's closure means "a lot less traffic" nowadays, but the store does offer a 
15% discount on new comics with the purchase of a $10 yearly membership. 
Members can also earn "bargain bucks" toward the purchase of back issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Mondays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sundays. 
(818) 766-5604.  
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 * Brave New World, 21048 Devonshire St., Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Opened just over a year ago, Brave New World sells every major comic as well 
as model kits, paperbacks, posters, T-shirts and old magazines such as Mad. 
"We're pretty diverse in what we get," says assistant manager Don Heinsberg, 
25. They also carry mature titles, although you have to ask for them at the 
counter. Like many shops, they also invite the occasional comics professional 
for in-store appearances. Later this month, former "Justice League" penciler 
Adam Hughes will visit the Chatsworth store and its older twin in Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth hours: 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Mondays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 9 
p.m. Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Sundays. (818) 341-2170.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * A Collector's Dream, 21222 Ventura Blvd., Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The store's small floor plan looks something like a studio apartment, and 
perhaps that's appropriate since owner Mike Frank spends virtually all his time 
there. "July 4th was my second day off this year," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelves are stocked with a good number of comics from most major 
publishers. For serious collectors, Frank runs an investment program where 
he'll select $25 worth of comics each month that he believes will increase in 
value. "I want to make my living but I don't want to gouge anybody," says 
Frank, 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays, noon to 6 p.m. Sundays. 
(818) 992-1636.  
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 * Comic Asylum, 22807 1/2 Saticoy St., West Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Catering mostly to kids and teen-agers, Comic Asylum sticks to mainstream 
comics, trading cards and Pogs -- avoiding such higher-priced items as graphic 
novels. "We don't carry off-the-wall kind of stuff," says co-owner Thwett, 24. 
For collectors and investors, the store maintains a bidding wall where 
customers can bring in their comics for weekly, sealed-bid auctions. In 
addition, Pog tournaments are held every Sunday, drawing as many as 50 young 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: noon to 7 p.m. Mondays through Wednesdays, noon to 8 p.m. Thursdays 
through Saturdays, noon to 6 p.m. Sundays. (818) 888-2756.  
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 * Comic City, 6633 Fallbrook Ave., in the Fallbrook Mall, West Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 This brand-new store, like its twin in the Sherman Oaks Galleria, caters 
primarily to kids and teen-agers, says co-owner Greg Schiffman, 25. Although 
they don't carry the weekly selection of new comics, back issues line the walls 
and the store does a brisk business in Pogs. According to Schiffman, the mall 
provides a wide range of customers, with parents and children often browsing 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people want to shop where they feel comfortable," he says. The 
store's name may change after Schiffman resolves some business matters with his 
partner, but you can find it next to Foot Locker. 
</P>
<P>
 West Hills hours: 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 7 
p.m. Sundays. (818) 313-9182.  
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 * Comic Jungle, 8925 Sepulveda Blvd., North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager George Marquez, 24, says the store specializes in popular, mainstream 
comics, trading cards, toys and Pogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a lot more knowledgeable about what they sell," says customer Nathan 
Storey, a 20-year comics reader. 
</P>
<P>
 With every $5 purchase, customers are entered in a monthly drawing for a 
current "hot" comic. Marquez, who speaks some Spanish, says he also tries to 
attract customers from the neighborhood's Latino population -- a demographic 
largely unserved by Valley comic shops. "A lot of people forget that there's a 
potential market for them," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: noon to 7 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays, noon to 8 p.m. Fridays, 11 
a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sundays. (818) 893-4487.  
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 * Comic Odyssey, 8238 Tampa Ave., Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 A clean, well-lit store with a good selection of comics, graphic novels and 
toys, Comic Odyssey has something for all readers. With sister shops in 
Panorama City and Simi Valley, owner Sandy Sansolis, 25, says he tries to serve 
"hard-core collectors" while encouraging new readers to enjoy comics as a 
hobby. 
</P>

 Still, he recognizes that comics fans are notoriously fickle, driven from one 
fad to the next. "If I had Power Rangers, I'd be rich," he says.

 * Continental Comics, 17032 Devonshire St., Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the Jan. 17 quake knocked most of this store's shelves down, but it also 
toppled an interior wall, making the place a bit bigger in the process. Back 
issues are still kept behind the counter -- "to keep 'em in better shape," says 
assistant manager Mike Garanchon, 25 -- but the selection is extensive. At 17 
years old, Continental is one of the older Valley comic book shops.  
</P>
<P>
 "We try to keep everything rather lively," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The store carries a variety of mainstream and esoteric titles, as well as 
Japanese animation videos, trading cards and toys.

<P>
 There's something spooky going on here. Maybe it's the creepy models of 
monsters and ghouls scattered throughout the small shop, their sightless eyes 
peering over your shoulder as you browse.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're almost like an anti-comic store," says owner Taylor White, 32. "We 
cater more toward the old monster crowd."  
</P>
<P>
 Although you'll find the latest comics from most major publishers, the store 
also has a large selection of vintage monster magazines and fanzines targeted 
to sci-fi and fantasy buffs and every stripe of collector. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gone out of our way to make this a much different store," White says.

 * The Flip Side, 18551 Ventura Blvd., Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 Started six years ago in Canoga Park as a used record store with comics, the 
Flip Side now boasts an impressive number of comics titles as well as movie 
posters, paperbacks, trading cards, Pogs and magazines at its 3,000-square-foot 
location. "We wanted to be able to offer customers a wide variety of products," 
says co-owner Derth Obbink, 49. 
</P>
<P>
 The used records and compact discs are still there, offering shoppers unique 
bartering opportunities. "People can trade records for comics or comics for 
records," Obbink says.

 * Forbidden Planet, 14513 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 A worldwide chain of independently owned comics, science-fiction and fantasy 
stores, Forbidden Planet sells a large variety of comics merchandise in the 
back of its neat and clean Valley store behind rows of sci-fi books. There are 
titles from nearly all publishers to choose from; employees will take the time 
to point out comics that match customers' interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Manager Joe Masset, 34, says: "I want people to explore them and 
find the thing they like best." 
</P>
<P>
 On the sci-fi side, the store frequently invites such authors as Ray Bradbury, 
Greg Bear, Clive Barker and William Gibson for book signings.

</P>
<P>
 Longtime DC Comics writer Marv Wolfman is a partner in this modest shop, 
although he's not involved with Future Frontier's sister store in the Santa 
Clarita Valley. The store offers a good selection of mainstream comics and 
comics industry magazines, as well as some trading cards and Pogs. Manager 
Craig Stone says the shop also has monthly sales. 
</P>

 "We can sit here and talk about comics all day," Stone, 21, says of regular 
customers. "I don't care if I sold 'em a book."

<P>
 Part of a three-store chain that began with its popular Hollywood location, 
Golden Apple packs a lot into its small Valley shop -- comics, graphic novels, 
toys, trading cards, videos and more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pretty much get everything we can," says employee Pat Morgan, 24. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection is good, with titles from nearly every publisher available on 
the racks, including "Flaxen," a comic book starring Golden Apple's mascot -- a 
mousy nurse who transforms into a buxom superhero. They also maintain a 24-hour 
hot line at (213) 651-0455 that lists current comics and in-store happenings.

 * Heroes, 1918 W. Olive Ave., Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 A few blocks from Emerald City, Heroes is a more traditional comics shop, 
offering the latest titles from mainstream publishers, as well as action 
figures, posters and a huge selection of non-sports cards. Owner Jake Hagopian, 
26, also carries gift items. Indeed, what better present for a science 
fiction-lovin' Dad than a "Star Trek" necktie?

<P>
 * Heroes & Legends, 5879 Kanan Road, Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Located a bit farther down the road from its previous Kanan Road location, 
Heroes & Legends now shares a mini-mall unit with a video rental store. 
Although new comics and back issues are available, the store concentrates more 
on Hollywood and sports memorabilia, says employee Corey Goldstein, 32. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so many new titles, it's overwhelming," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with current trends, the shop also sells several varieties of 
trading cards and Pogs.

<P>
 Formerly Comic Kingdom, the store and its counterpart in Granada Hills are 
under new management. The selection leans mostly to mainstream comics, although 
trading cards and inexpensive Pogs are also for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 According to employee Cat Jercan, 26, the store is willing to bargain with 
customers to keep them coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to be cheap with everything," he says. "If I have to break even, I will 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Comic Asylum, the store also has weekly Pog tournaments for kids 14 and 
younger. 
</P>

 Hours: 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Mondays through Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.

 Parking isn't great and there's very little breathing room inside, but the 
3-year-old shop is often buzzing with activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of energy," says manager Linda Fougere, 43. 
</P>
<P>
 All major titles are here, as well as every variety of non-sports trading 
cards. And with every $5 purchase, customers are entered in a weekly raffle of 
store merchandise. And parents, if you're on the hunt for "Power Rangers" toys, 
this is the place to come. But be sure to bring your wallet, since the rarities 
aren't cheap.

 * Pee Wee Comics, 7520 Topanga Canyon Blvd., Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Another veteran Valley store, Pee Wee began in 1984 and has since opened shops 
in Agoura Hills and Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to start a store that I'd be comfortable with as a customer," says 
co-owner Charles Pira, 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the store expanded its merchandise line to include toys, 
magazines, T-shirts and collectibles, but as Pira explains, "our biggest push 
is customer service." 
</P>
<P>
 Pee Wee has frequent sales, such as its annual Thanksgiving Day blowout, when 
customers are treated to pie, milk and coffee, and all comics are half off. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 12:30 to 7 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Fridays,

 This is the store with everything -- and 2,000 square feet to hold it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a much wider selection," says Sam Silbert, the store's 28-year-old 
owner. "We carry the full lines -- dozens of companies and a lot of the small 
ones." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the store maintains one of the largest collections of graphic novels 
from publishers large and small, in addition to a wide selection of Japanese 
comics and videos. On the game front, the store carries a sizable number of 
fantasy role-playing products, but no Pogs. "We're out of the Pog business, 
thank God," Silbert says with a chuckle.

 Not a very big store, but clean, bright and stocked with comics and graphic 
novels from most major publishers, as well as toys, models, books and other 
memorabilia related to such sci-fi mainstays as "Star Trek" and "Star Wars." 
</P>
<P>
 "We tend to carry more trendy, unusual items," says manager Barbara Lubbers, 
35. "The staff is geared to talk to the customers and show 'em what we have." 
</P>
<P>
 And although they don't sell back issues in the traditional sense, there are 
usually a few months worth of each comic at cover price.

COVER STORY; A GUILTY PLEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jonah Weiland calls it an addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 He spends nearly $200 on his habit each month, making weekly visits to a 
Canoga Park store for more. 
</P>
<P>
 His vice? Comic books. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22-year-old Northridge resident got hooked on the multicolor fantasies 
nearly nine years ago while a freshman in high school, encouraged by friends 
and an English teacher who taught comics as literature. 
</P>
<P>
 Those friends have moved on, but the addiction remains. 
</P>
<P>
 He started small, buying a few titles at first, but as his income grew, so did 
his reading list. As a sound engineer for radio station KFI-AM 640 in Los 
Angeles, he's now able to afford more than 100 titles a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "My closet's been taken over by them," he admits. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he remembers his first -- a 1986 issue of "Action Comics" that marked 
Superman's last hurrah before a radical make-over. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Chodorow of Reseda, one of Weiland's comics-buying friends, says that 
while he doesn't buy as many titles, he does understand the addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I actually used to spend that much," the 26-year-old psychology graduate 
student says. "It's a bit excessive." 
</P>
<P>
 Both say they seek out titles for the writing, although their tastes differ 
slightly. Chodorow cites comics such as "Groo the Wanderer" and "Next Men" as 
favorites, while Weiland names "Bone" and "Sandman" as his picks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will read a poorly drawn comic if it's well-written," Weiland says. "I will 
drop a poorly written comic in a second." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiland has an enthusiastic booster in his mother, Sue, who agrees that comics 
have more to offer than some parents think. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really are very well-written," she says. "A lot of kids in this day and 
age don't have as much interest in reading. I think anything that encourages 
kids to read helps a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many investors buy "hot" comics simply as a fast-buck investment, 
Weiland only purchases titles he intends to read -- a daunting task given the 
amount he brings home each week from Pee Wee Comics in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get behind," he admits, indicating a months-old pile of comics in a bedroom 
at his parents' home. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiland estimates that he's amassed 6,000 to 7,000 comics in his short time as 
a collector, most protected in plastic bags and boxes and indexed via computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to keep them for the future, maybe so that my kids can have them," he 
says.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the amount of time and money invested in their habits, neither Weiland 
or Chodorow see themselves as "fanboys" -- comics' nerd equivalent. "Mostly 
because I keep myself interested in a lot of things," Weiland says, naming 
science fiction, sports and news as his other passions. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Weiland does acknowledge that despite their increasing 
sophistication, comic books are still something of a guilty pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all juvenile stuff that's fun to read and look back on," he says. "It is 
juvenile, but it's entertaining."

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: THE ROUTE TO RESALE; SHOPS IN PASADENA'S OLD TOWN OFFER 
DESIGNER GOWNS TO HOME FURNISHINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the best destinations for a day of treasure-hunting is Old Town in 
Pasadena, where a cluster of upscale resale stores are within walking distance 
of each other. 
</P>
<P>
 First, a word of warning about Pasadena parking meters: Take plenty of 
quarters because you only get 15 minutes for each one. If you're going to be 
more than two hours, the public parking structures are cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Cancer Society's Discovery Shop is a good place to start for some 
excellent deals on family apparel and home furnishings. All merchandise is 
donated, either by manufacturers, retailers or private citizens, and the 
quality is way above thrift-store fare. Whether your budget will allow $8 or 
$1,800, the pickings are good. 
</P>
<P>
 Four good sources for consignment goods are around the corner on Union Street. 
Silent Partners, a small but well-organized shop, was brimming with good buys 
on women's designer clothing.  
</P>
<P>
 The focus is on apparel for the professional woman, and a large selection of 
suits by Adolfo, Escada and Ellen Tracy reflects this. But there also is 
dazzling evening wear -- some by designers we rarely see in resale stores. We 
found an elegant yellow chiffon gown by Greek designer Stavropoulos. This one 
happened to be new, and was priced at only $189. (In a department store, it 
would probably be $500.) You'll find a wide selection of accessories here, as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 More than three years ago, I wrote about the great buys on men's designer 
apparel at Bailey's, next door to Silent Partners. The deals for men are still 
terrific, and a new department has been added -- designer resale for the larger 
woman, with such names as Tamotsu and Criscione on the racks at $80 or $90, 
when they generally sell for around $300. 
</P>
<P>
 Next door to Bailey's is Resale Madness, which has the largest space of any 
store on the street. When we visited, it had only been open two weeks and the 
selection was slim. Owner Becky Ramey said the furniture "flew out of here" the 
previous week because prices were so low. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross the street to Clothes Heaven, where top designer apparel is crammed onto 
the racks and tagged at about one-fourth of the original price. We found enough 
never-worn haute couture treasures to make the whole day a success. Where to

MAKING SALES 'ROUND THE SOFA; 'HOME SHOPPING' HAS A NEW MEANING AS MORE PEOPLE 
COMBINE BUSINESS WITH PLEASURE TO HAWK MERCHANDISE FROM LIVING ROOMS.

regular contributor to The Times.

<P>
 The invitation may be simple, printed on a flyer or postcard. Come on over for 
tea, coffee cake, even wine and cheese. And shop for jewelry, or baskets, or 
photo albums, even earthquake supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the new home-shopping network, combining the pleasure of gathering with 
friends and neighbors with the fun of seeing new things and buying them. 
Home-based entrepreneurial salespeople, often tied to nationally based firms, 
are putting on social-shopping soirees in homes, offering the host or hostess a 
cut of the total sales or special gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Some salespeople have left careers to create a more flexible, family-friendly 
lifestyle. Debbie Nunez of Agoura worked in a brokerage firm. But now, with 3- 
and 5-year-olds at home, she and her mother, Judy Johnson, sell gold-plated and 
gold-filled jewelry through Karin's Kreations, a West Hills firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Shaw of West Hills left a teaching career to become a sales agent for 
Creative Memories, based in St. Cloud, Minn. She does about eight parties a 
month, during which she teaches how to safely and creatively mount family 
photos, and sells the acid-free colored paper, paper cutters and templates. "I 
love it. I've never enjoyed anything so much," said Shaw, who has four 
children, ages 3 to 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said selling is easier when it is done in a party at someone's home. 
"Most people feel more comfortable working with friends and in a small group 
situation," she said. She also said the growing popularity of home-shopping 
parties is a sign that people are searching for a sense of community. "There's 
a camaraderie -- I see it as a community-building trend." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Others combine the sales career with another day job. Brenda Bunch, a 
registered nurse at Northridge Hospital Medical Center, works out of her home 
in Valencia to schedule basket parties. The baskets, hand-made by Longaberger 
in Ohio, come in all sizes and shapes, and cost between $20 and $90 each. While 
Bunch says she enjoys nursing, she finds selling exciting, and she loves the 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Essrig owns Westlake Village-based Earthquake Services & Products and has 
been organizing earthquake parties for two years. He said advertising was not 
effective in reaching residential communities, and discovered that people buy 
more in a group setting than they do one-on-one. Since the Northridge quake, 
he's been booking three times as many parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Essrig's quake parties start with a little casual socializing, followed by a 
half-hour talk about what to do when a quake occurs. Then he shows a videotape 
of the 1989 Loma Prieta quake -- for shock value -- and reviews the products 
available, from two-person backpacks with first aid supplies, ponchos, food and 
other equipment for $69.95, to a five-person family supply kit for $169. The 
hosting family gets 10% of what is sold that evening, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Longaberger basket parties also feature a short video, highlighting the 
product's craftsmanship and the ways baskets can be used to entertain and 
decorate, said Kathleen Gentile, also a nurse at Northridge Hospital who does 
home parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentile said an average party entails about four hours of work, but nets a 
$250 profit. 
</P>

 She, too, finds that the allure of the parties is the socializing. "Part of 
the intrigue is doing something social," she said. "It's a way to meet other 
people."

<P>
 Because many of their friends have young children, Johnson and Nunez set up 
their parties as an open house. The parents just bring along the kids as they 
schmooze and shop.

 Johnson and Nunez said that their initial investment was less than $1,000, and 
that they have been putting their profits back into inventory.

 "We've always thought of having our own business we could do out of our homes,

STAYING TRUE TO CASUAL, QUIET IMAGE

 Coffeehouses have become the after-hours places, alternatives to nightclubs 
that serve alcohol. Some are even so popular that they've become just like the 
clubs some patrons were trying to escape. Emerson's is one spot that has stayed 
true to its customers and to the idea that a coffeehouse should be a place to 
hang out and relax. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: Emerson's is small and intimate, with two tables outside and about 
a dozen inside. The entertainment area is a spot created by taking a table out 
of the way just inside the door. The house has "Baby Boomer Trivial Pursuit" at 
every table, and customers can ask for just about any board game, including 
chess, a favorite among the regulars. "The owner and the people who work here 
are really into doing what you want," said Christian Carollo, 20, of 
Northridge. "If you're a regular, they remember what you like." 
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: The crowd is young, 18 to 30, casual and, generally, the men 
outnumber the women. "People here don't wear Birkenstocks," said Glendale 
resident Andre Navasargian, 19, which drew a protest from one of his group who 
was. Undaunted, he added, "It's kind of like a Berkeley coffeehouse. The 
atmosphere is very laid back, full of college types." 
</P>
<P>
 THE MUSIC: On a recent Saturday night, Doug Rowell, a bearded folk-rock 
singer, entertained the audience with his off-color songs. Michael Stern, 53, 
of Studio City said he comes to Emerson's whenever Rowell performs, about once 
every two months. "His stuff is mostly original, melodic, irreverent and 
sometimes prurient," Stern said. Despite the lack of a working sound system, 
Rowell kept the crowd's attention with good music and humor. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: Emerson's is a quiet place that has a little of everything. 
Customers can sit and read, or get together and talk with friends. "We were 
trying to decide where to go and we didn't want to go to one of those trendy 
coffeehouses," said Matt Royz, 23, of San Diego. Van Nuys resident Adam Maron, 
also 23, added: "We're not too partial to coffeehouses -- too many trendy 
pseudo-Bohemians. It's taking the heart out of something that was once cool, 
but this one is kinda nice." 
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: One man said he didn't like the food -- which includes sandwiches, 
pasta and pastries -- but others said it was good. A group of men who dropped 
in for coffee and dessert before going to see "The Mask" said the apple pie was 
too dry. Lorenda Starfelt, 39, who lives nearby, said: "There should be more 
tables outside. We sit there when there are tables free." 
</P>
<P>
 SMOKE OUT: Emerson's restaurant permit requires a smoke-free environment 
inside, but smoking is allowed at the outside tables. The indoor ban on smoking 
doesn't sit well with some of the patrons left to brave the elements of Ventura 
Boulevard to indulge their habit. "I only have one question: Why can't you 
smoke in there? You can smoke everywhere in Chicago," said Windy City resident 
Terry Kontos, 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson's, 13203 Ventura Blvd., Studio City, is open from 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. 
Fridays and Saturdays, 8 a.m. to 1 a.m. Sundays through Thursdays. No cover.

RESOURCE FOR WOMEN; THE REFERRAL SERVICE INCLUDES A HOT LINE AND YELLOW PAGES 
DIRECTORY PLUS NETWORKING AND MARKETING WORKSHOPS.

<P>
 Seventeen years ago, Nancy Sardella went looking for a female gynecologist. 
But despite her best efforts, she couldn't find one -- or anyone who could 
recommend one -- short of turning to the phone book. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that other women might share her frustration -- and sensing the 
tip of a business iceberg -- Sardella decided to start the Women's Referral 
Service, a telephone hot line that refers women to businesses and services 
targeted at them, and perhaps more important, are friendly toward them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started out just as something I would do as a community service, so women 
could find each other," said Sardella, whose referral service has grown into a 
multifaceted but still female-oriented business that she says supports her and 
her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the more than 3,000 members of the Women's Referral Service's 16 
Southern California chapters pay a yearly fee, based on the services they 
desire. These services range from participation in networking meetings and 
marketing workshops, to listing in a member directory, to optional inclusion in 
the telephone referral service. In addition, the service publishes the Women's 
Yellow Pages, a 186-page phone directory with advertisements by referral 
service members and other individuals and businesses. The advertisers' target 
customers are women entrepreneurs who earn more than $50,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line: Everything we created here is because there was a need," 
Sardella said. Referral service members "wanted to meet each other, so we 
started the networking meetings. Then we made a directory where we could list 
our names. Then we started the Women's Yellow Pages. And when the recession hit 
California, a lot of our members were going out of business, and so we started 
the workshops." 
</P>
<P>
 This month, the referral service's main office will return to its Sherman Oaks 
location, after a stay in Sardella's home while quake repairs were being made. 
The restored building will be called the Women's Business Development Center 
and will house administrative offices and educational services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge quake also delayed printing of the 1994 Women's Yellow Pages 
from January until May, but the circulation this year was an all-time high of 
90,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although distributed for free, mainly at conferences and to companies that 
want access to businesswomen, the phone directory may be purchased for $10.95 
at specialty bookstores or through the referral service. 
</P>
<P>
 Thumbing through the Women's Yellow pages, you'll first come across the Los 
Angeles Survival Guide, a directory of services for women, followed by a series 
of essays written by Southern California businesswomen. Topics range from 
"Sexual Harassment: Serious Business in the Workplace" to "Meet Your Body: Yoga 
Helps Women Rediscover Themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the real meat of this phone book is the thousands of advertisements from 
women and men (10% of the yellow pages advertisers are male) all of whom have 
been screened by Sardella's staff. "We validate who they are, what they've done 
and look for three good solid references on them," Sardella said. 
</P>
<P>
 If an electrician, for instance, wants to become a member of the referral 
service, or even just to advertise in the Women's Yellow Pages, she pays a fee 
-- the amount varying depending on the services selected. Then she receives an 
application asking her how long she's been in business, what she specializes 
in, and requesting a photocopy of her state license, as well as three signed 
references from customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ask the customers how they know the person and if they know them to 
provide quality service," Sardella said. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone makes it. "If we don't get the references back, they don't 
get approved" either as referral service members or for inclusion in the yellow 
pages, Sardella said. "We've had people apply who come from out of town and 
have nothing established, and if we can't get any information, they don't get 
in. . . . We want to make sure that when somebody uses this, they can really 
trust and rely on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Karen Valenti's North Hollywood Discount Auto Repair has just started 
advertising in the Women's Yellow Pages, she said she thinks it will help 
promote her shop. "Complete auto repair with the feminine understanding," reads 
the slogan than runs with her listing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really care about women taking care of their cars," Valenti said. "There's 
a good feeling of basic honesty and credibility in this business, which they've 
found is very hard to find." 
</P>
<P>
 Valenti said she decided to advertise in the Women's Yellow Pages because of a 
client, also a businesswoman, whose brakes Valenti was repairing. "I hadn't 
heard of it until then, but it got a bug in my ear and I grabbed hold of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Bennett, owner of A.A.&B. Plumbing in Van Nuys, said he has belonged to 
several networking organizations, but that only the Women's Referral Service 
has been worth his time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a camaraderie like nothing I've ever seen," Bennett said. "I won't 
call anyone now without checking with the referral service first." 
</P>
<P>
 And, Bennett said, he has experienced no discomfort as one of the few men in 
an organization made up mostly of women. "There are no games going on," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond providing a networking resource for women, Sardella said she wants to 
emphasize to women entrepreneurs that business today is about relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "The usual business route has changed. It used to be that you could go into 
business, hang a sign outside your door and put an ad in the paper," Sardella 
said. "Business is now happening at the relationship level and it is an art to 
build strategic alliances." 
</P>
<P>
 Sardella's workshops teach women who were once taught to be frugal and to 
manage the household money to become aggressive entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to stop clipping coupons," Sardella said, and start taking risks and 
making strong alliances. Where to Go

entrepreneurial women in Southern California.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; FEEDING THE DREAMS OF STEAK EATERS; THE BEEF IS ESTIMABLE, 
THE REST OF THE MEAL SUBSTANTIAL AT 100 WEST -- AN AMERICAN GRILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 100 West -- An American Grill is sizzling. 
</P>
<P>
 When the restaurant opened two years back (as plain old 100 West), the overly 
ambitious concept -- a selection of tastings from a large, fairly 
indecipherable menu -- apparently confused more people than it convinced. So 
four months ago, the restaurant metamorphosed into a traditional steakhouse, 
better suited to its clientele and more in line with the limitations of a hotel 
kitchen (it's in Glendale's Red Lion Hotel). Now everything works quite well, 
thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 The handsome, spacious dining room, dominated by towering wooden pillars, has 
developed a surprisingly cozy air. The once-harsh overhead lighting has been 
softened, and a series of framed photographs depicting Glendale early in the 
century adds a homey touch to the walls. Now that the place serves an 
old-fashioned steakhouse menu, nostalgia pix (as seen in any number of other 
L.A. steakhouses) make perfect sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the sizzle I referred to is provided by the hot iron platters on which 
all entrees are served. The beef is a steak eater's dream -- grain-fed Montfort 
Chef beef from Colorado, aged for 21 days. The rest of the meal is substantial, 
in the steakhouse manner. All entrees come with a salad as well as a choice of 
potato side dishes. There are also domes of herb-crusted sourdough bread. 
</P>
<P>
 So you need to order judiciously, especially if you're going all out and 
getting an appetizer as well as an entree. There's a good shrimp cocktail, a 
true steakhouse version with four huge prawns hanging out of a huge iced bowl. 
They haven't lost their natural crunch, either, and they're helped along by a 
tangy red cocktail sauce that is not at all shy with the horseradish. 
Workmanlike fried calamari come with a light breading and two sauces, one a 
rather nondescript marinara, the other a gooey herb-cheese sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a tomato-onion salad on the menu, which has a somewhat redundant air, 
given that you automatically get salad (tossed in a sweetish vinaigrette) with 
your entree, and I must say that the tomatoes, though advertised as 
vine-ripened, taste no riper than most you find in a supermarket. The tomato 
salad does have a tangy olive oil and balsamic vinegar dressing, though, and 
aficionados of blue cheese will probably appreciate the liberal way it's 
sprinkled here, giving it a powerful kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Now you are probably ready to grab that wood-handled steak knife and dig into 
a hunk of meat. You could order a tender and flavorful 12-ounce rib eye -- a 
beautifully marbled piece of meat that cuts as easily as ripe cheese. Filet 
mignon is another intelligent choice, an eight-ounce center cut that is leaner 
than the rib eye and nearly as tender. 
</P>
<P>
 The porterhouse, which weighs 14 ounces, demonstrates one of the elemental 
truths of butchering: The filet muscle is far more tender than the strip, which 
constitutes the other side of this cut. The 10-ounce New York sirloin is my 
least favorite of the steaks I tasted here. It's not as tender as the other 
cuts, and perhaps not as intensely beefy either.  
</P>
<P>
 Our waiter described the double-cut lamb chops as "the best in the city," and 
I wouldn't argue. The chops (two to an order) are thick and juicy, with two 
ribs each, and mine were cooked perfectly red in the center, with nicely 
charred edges. The only other entree I've tried was the smoked and grilled half 
chicken, a trencherman's portion that had a somewhat rubbery texture. 
</P>
<P>
 The potato side dishes are all winners. The best of them is 100 West pan-fried 
potato, which is like a shredded potato cake, or perhaps something between a 
potato pancake and hash browns. 
</P>
<P>
 The desserts are pretty much those you expect in a hotel restaurant: berries 
in liqueur, an almond tuile cookie filled with ice cream, a rather tired fudge 
nut pie. But this is a restaurant that knows its limitations and makes the best 
of them. And for that, we can all be just a little bit grateful. Where and When

 DUCK RACE: After a month's delay, the Ventura County Symphony finally has its 
ducks in a row. . . . Its rubber duck race sets sail Saturday. The plan: 
unleash 5,000 or so yellow rubber ducks on a canal near the Santa Clara River. 
Sponsors have adopted 4,500 ducks at five bucks apiece. And the lucky duck to 
finish first brings the winner a new car. . . . At first, the event ran afoul 
of the law. Now everything's ducky and the notoriety has attracted more donors. 
As the symphony's Cassandra Petrovich says: "Nothing gets you more notice than 
being accused of criminal activity." 
</P>
<P>
 LEGAL THRILLER: In the early 1980s, Nancy Taylor Rosenberg was a probation 
officer in Ventura County. She probed the backgrounds of convicted felons and 
recommended sentences. The memory of one convicted rapist, Leonard Chester, 
still haunts her today. . . . "This guy had these long eyelashes and pretty 
face," she said. "It was hard for me to believe he was guilty of these horrible 
crimes." Rosenberg built her third novel, "First Offense," partly around a 
fictional character based on Chester. She signs copies of the book Saturday at 
the Ventura Bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
 GRAFFITI BUSTER: Who you gonna call . . . when taggers deface your 
neighborhood? Erwin Dreger is one of a growing band of citizen crime-fighters 
who've become a vandal's nightmare (B4). . . . When he drives around Simi 
Valley, Dreger breaks for graffiti. He slips into coveralls and blots out 
spray-painted marks with a paint roller. "For me," he said, "it's not enough to 
wait for somebody else to come along and get rid of it." 
</P>
<P>
 MARATHON MAN: Twenty-two miles across the sea, Santa Catalina is waiting . . . 
for Jim McConica. For a decade, the Ventura car dealer held the record for 
swimming the channel in 8 hours, 27 minutes. But his record fell last fall to 
another marathon swimmer. Since then, McConica has prepared to take the plunge 
again (C8). . . . At 43, he races daily against the clock. "I had to do it 
again," he said, "before I was too old."

HOUSE APPROVES 2 WIDE-RANGING BANKING BILLS; CONGRESS: ONE WOULD REPEAL 
INTERSTATE RESTRICTIONS, THE OTHER WOULD ENCOURAGE LENDING IN DISTRESSED AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The House approved two wide-ranging banking bills Thursday, one repealing 
decades-old restrictions on interstate banking and the other encouraging 
lending in distressed communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The interstate measure, approved on a voice vote, dismantles legal barriers 
dating to the 1920s and is expected to accelerate the already-rapid pace of 
consolidation in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The second bill, passed 410 to 12, is a watered-down version of what President 
Clinton proposed in his 1992 election campaign. It authorizes spending $382 
million over four years to encourage lending in inner cities, poor rural areas 
and Native American reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton originally envisioned spending nearly $1 billion to create 100 
for-profit banks specializing in community development lending. However, most 
of the reduced amount in the bill would be spent on grants to existing lending 
organizations, many of which are nonprofit. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to a third could be spent on deposit-insurance subsidies to non-specialized 
commercial banks and savings institutions that increase their lending in 
distressed neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Both bills represent compromises worked out last week in a conference 
committee of House members and senators. 
</P>
<P>
 Approval by the Senate, expected within the next two weeks, would send the 
bills to Clinton, who is expected to sign both. However, there is a chance the 
interstate measure could be delayed in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) is threatening to use parliamentary tactics to hold 
up final passage. He objects to a provision overturning a court decision that 
erodes Texas home foreclosure protections that also prevent homeowners in the 
state from obtaining home equity loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Interstate banking advocates say the measure would make banking more 
convenient for the 60 million Americans who live in metropolitan areas 
straddling state borders. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time, consumers will be able to do their banking at whatever 
branch is most convenient to them, be it across town or across the country," 
said Rep. Stephen L. Neal (D-N.C.) 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents say lifting interstate barriers will produce a banking system less 
prone to failure and better able to lend in good times and bad. Opponents warn 
it would mean fewer and bigger banks, more layoffs of bank employees and less 
control over lending by local bankers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This legislation may actually be a boon to big banks but a bust to consumers. 
They could end up having credit decisions made by lenders who sit in offices 
thousands of miles away," said Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II (D-Mass.)

POLL RESULTS BY BOTH SIDES IN LANDFILL ISSUE DIFFER; ECOLOGY: SURVEY BY BACKERS 
OF WELDON CANYON SITE SAYS 56% OF VOTERS WOULD SUPPORT INITIATIVE. OPPONENTS' 
RESEARCH SHOWS ONLY 43% IN FAVOR. 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura County voters would approve the Weldon Canyon landfill measure by a 
2-to-1 landslide, according to a poll released Thursday by project supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 But Weldon's foes have commissioned their own poll, and say their results show 
the contest is neck-and-neck. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only thing the two groups agree on is that there is surprisingly 
little difference between voters in the east and west county, despite rhetoric 
on both sides characterizing the fight as a divisive battle between the two 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no east versus west conflict in the county over Weldon," said Robert 
G. Meadows, president of Decision Research, the polling firm hired by the 
landfill backers. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, scheduled for the November ballot, would give landfill 
supporters the zoning and land-use approvals needed to build the dump. Federal, 
state and other local agencies would still have to grant permits for it to 
operate. 
</P>
<P>
 Meadows said his poll of 650 likely voters in late July showed that 56% of the 
voters countywide would favor the initiative. In the eastern portion of the 
county, 64% would favor the measure, compared to 56% in the west county. The 
poll has a margin of error of 4.5 percentage points in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not really surprised at all," said Eloise Brown, the Moorpark activist 
who heads the pro-landfill Ventura Citizens for Environmental Solutions. The 
group, which paid for the poll, is closely connected to Taconic Resources Inc., 
the company behind the landfill initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown characterized landfill opponents as a small group of not-in-my-back-yard 
activists who do not represent the county as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the years there have been an extraordinarily active and vocal group of 
NIMBYs, while the rest of us who have tolerated what's happened have been too 
quiet," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But a second poll, conducted days later for the Environmental Defense Center 
in Santa Barbara, produced strikingly different results. 
</P>
<P>
 That poll showed 43% of the county's voters support the measure and 40% are 
against it. The poll of 400 likely voters, conducted by National Demographic 
Corp. of Claremont, had a margin of error of 5 percentage points, pollsters 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 In that poll, 42% of west county voters and 45% of east county voters favored 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were bracing ourselves for horrific results," said John Nava, a leader in 
the anti-dump movement. "The bottom line is that, in fact, it's very close." 
</P>
<P>
 That point could be moot if opponents win a legal challenge aimed at knocking 
the initiative off the ballot. A judge is scheduled to hear arguments on the 
case Aug. 22, despite pleas from landfill supporters that he wait until after 
the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 Polling experts say a difference in survey results is not particularly 
surprising when opposing sides are asking the questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're basically polling for their side," said Susan H. Pinkus, assistant 
director of The Los Angeles Times Poll. "They try to find out which arguments 
are going to work." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Weldon foes, for instance, asked about alternatives to landfills, as well 
as questions they could use to develop campaign strategy, Nava said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pro-landfill Ventura Citizens group quizzed voters about their perception 
of the Ojai residents who were instrumental in killing the Weldon Canyon 
project before it came to the Board of Supervisors last year, said Meadows, a 
pollster based in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Meadows also asked questions pertinent to the two Ventura County supervisor 
races that will be decided in November. He said he did not know how his clients 
would use that information, but those elections could change the current 
anti-Weldon majority on the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Nava charged that the landfill supporters' poll, released to reporters 
Thursday morning, was intended primarily for public consumption. The opponents' 
poll was released as a response, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They ran their survey for propaganda purposes," Nava argued. "They want to 
use their so-called 'scientific' results to stampede undecided voters into 
their camp." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meadows defended his poll. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of the poll is really not so you would have a news release," he 
said. "The Ventura Citizens group, they're interested in knowing what people 
think and not in fooling themselves. They need to get an honest assessment." 
</P>
<P>
 His workers read the exact wording of the ballot initiative to likely voters 
at the beginning and again at the end of the questioning -- a technique Pinkus 
said is considered reliable by independent pollsters. 
</P>
<P>
 The opponents' pollsters did not read the initiative or specifically mention 
Weldon Canyon in a key question, referring instead to "a new landfill to open 
near Ojai." 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Nava said the opponents' poll was primarily for internal use and 
was intended to get a rough gauge of people's attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't the battle of the polls," Meadows added. "The voters are going to 
make this decision." What the Surveys Found Supporters and opponents of 
building a landfill at Weldon Canyon released results of voter surveys 
Thursday. Here are the results: 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents' question: "To promote recycling and to resolve the problem of 
solid waste disposal, shall Ventura County allow the building of a solid-waste 
landfill at Weldon Canyon . . . provided that the landfill meets or exceeds all 
health and safety requirements and obtains all permits from federal, state and 
local agencies responsible for maintaining air and water quality and that the 
disposal fees not exceed the amount set by the county or the cities using the 
landfill?"

DISABLED GET JOBS CLEANING POLLING BOOTHS; LABOR: WORKERS WITH MENTAL DISORDERS 
ARE ALSO INSPECTING THE BALLOTING MACHINES UNDER A CONTRACT WITH VENTURA 
COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mentally disabled workers are helping prepare for November's election by 
cleaning polling booths and inspecting balloting machines -- a jobs 
breakthrough that advocates hope could lead to more county contracts in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County elections office has contracted with ARC-Ventura County for 
disabled workers to wipe smudges and dirt from 4,000 polling booths and to make 
sure ballot punch machines are working properly, said Alisa Mahrer, who heads 
up the jobs program for ARC-Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first time that ARC has subcontracted its workers for jobs in county 
government, Mahrer said. She hopes it will open the door to more county jobs 
for the mentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would love to see our workers used more often by county government," Mahrer 
said. "The possibilities are wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheila Mahon is among four adults who work in the election office's warehouse 
Monday through Thursday from 8:30 to 2:30 wiping grime from polling booths and 
reboxing them. 
</P>
<P>
 The work is repetitive, but Mahon said she is glad to have it. She saves every 
penny she makes in a bank account, Mahon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go to Disneyland," said Mahon, 40, who lives with her parents in 
Ojai. "I've never been there." 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Dunbar, 22, of Santa Barbara said he, too, is grateful for the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets boring at home watching TV all day," Dunbar said. "I used to do that 
for two years, but then I got the hang of working." 
</P>
<P>
 Maintenance on the polling booths and ballot machines is routinely done after 
each election, said Georgia Dennehy, an elections department supervisor. It 
traditionally has been farmed out on contract to warehouse workers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a friend told her about ARC's work program, Dennehy decided to check 
it out. After talking to ARC officials and touring its Ventura assembly plant, 
Dennehy and elections chief Bruce Bradley decided to award the contract to ARC 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Altruism was not their only motive, Dennehy said. The county also saved money: 
Contract warehouse workers are individually paid $7.68 per hour, but ARC agreed 
to supply workers at $6.35 an hour and make the deal even sweeter by only 
charging the county for two workers, instead of the four actually assigned to 
the cleaning job. 
</P>
<P>
 The theory behind that agreement was that the disabled workers' productivity 
may not be as high as a worker who has no disabilities, Mahrer said. She said 
the workers themselves do not suffer from the arrangement because ARC 
reimburses them to make sure they receive a minimum wage of about $5 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But warehouse supervisor Danny Lopez said he is impressed by what he's seen so 
far. The ARC workers started on July 18 and are scheduled to finish the job by 
the end of August. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had good workers in the past," said Lopez, who has run the warehouse for 
five years. "But the people from ARC are very concentrated on the task at hand. 
They are very efficient." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley agreed, calling the workers the "Forrest Gump Brigade." 
</P>
<P>
 "Their ability to concentrate is like his," said Bradley, referring to the 
fictional movie hero who overcomes mental slowness to live a life of success 
and achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys just don't goof off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahrer said ARC teaches the disabled how to perform simple tasks at five 
ARC-owned job sites spread throughout Ventura County. Then the group tries to 
match a person's abilities with the job requests it receives from 38 employers 
countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 ARC workers find short-term and permanent jobs at grocery stores, flower 
shops, pet stores and clerical offices. But until this year, the 40-year-old 
agency had never placed workers in a county government job, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mahrer said she hopes the success of the workers in the elections division 
will spur other county department heads to hire workers, either directly or 
through a subcontract with ARC. 
</P>
<P>
 ARC usually supplies a "job coach" to supervise the disabled employee's work, 
she said.  
</P>
<P>
 But some workers become so good at their job that the coach is no longer 
necessary, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 ARC serves about 300 developmentally disabled adults in Ventura County. Most 
of them suffer from mental disorders that occur at birth, such as Down's 
syndrome, cerebral palsy and mental retardation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 ARC's ultimate goal is to encourage independence in disabled people and help 
them find permanent jobs, she said. Other county jobs that ARC workers could do 
include stuffing and labeling envelopes, stocking equipment and performing 
janitorial work, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I truly believe there is a job out there for everyone," Mahrer said. "But it 
has to be the right job for the right person."

ELECTIONS / FINANCING; O'CONNELL TOP FUND-RAISER IN LEGISLATIVE RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblyman Jack O'Connell has raised more cash for his state Senate campaign 
than any other Ventura County legislative candidate and holds a huge 
fund-raising lead over his Republican opponent in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign finance reports filed this week by O'Connell show that the 
Carpinteria Democrat had $247,018 in his campaign account as of the end of 
June, while Republican opponent Steve MacElvaine reported less than $3,000 in 
the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The two are competing for the seat being vacated by retiring state Sen. Gary 
Hart (D-Santa Barbara), whose 18th District covers Ventura, Santa Paula, Ojai 
and all of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Among O'Connell's largest contributors were the California Medical PAC, which 
gave $3,250; the California Optometric PAC, which gave $6,100, and the 
California State Employees Assn., which contributed $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MacElvaine, a cattle rancher and former San Luis Obispo County supervisor, 
spent $124,496 to defeat Santa Barbara businessman Steve Decker in the 
Republican primary in June. 
</P>
<P>
 MacElvaine said he is undeterred by O'Connell's fund-raising prowess, pointing 
out that the district is nearly split down the middle between Republican and 
Democratic voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need $1 million to go up against him," said MacElvaine, who has 
loaned his campaign $90,000. "We'll raise enough to compete against him." 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for O'Connell's 35th Assembly District seat, Republican candidate 
Brooks Firestone holds a significant fund-raising lead over Democratic 
challenger Mindy Lorenz. 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone reported $211,557 in cash on hand as of June 30, including loans of 
more than $65,000 from himself and family members. Meanwhile, Lorenz reported a 
mere $1,496 in the bank following her expensive primary victory over Bob Ream, 
an aide to Hart. Both Lorenz and Ream spent more than $100,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Since filing her last financial report, Lorenz said she has raised an 
additional $20,000 and has a number of fund-raising events planned in coming 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew (Firestone) would have a financial advantage coming out of an 
uncontested primary," said Lorenz, who has loaned her campaign $10,000. "But I 
have more name recognition. That's what the primary did for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard) far exceeded the fund-raising efforts of 
Democratic challenger Dorothy Maron. Takasugi had $57,137 in reserves at the 
end of June, while Maron reported a balance of $2,664. 
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi received a $1,000 contribution from Exxon Corp. and contributions of 
$500 each from the California Telephone Assn., Hewlett Packard and the 
California Medical PAC, according to his latest financial statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi is seeking reelection in the 37th Assembly District, which extends 
from Oxnard to Moorpark and Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Maron said she knows she faces an uphill battle against Takasugi but believes 
she can run a credible grass-roots campaign against the assemblyman. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question I have my work cut out for me," said Maron, who has 
loaned her campaign $6,000. "I'm certainly not going to be able to raise what 
Mr. Takasugi has raised. . . . I'm a Democrat. We have more difficulty raising 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 In statewide races, state Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), a candidate for 
lieutenant governor, spent $316,942 to win the GOP primary. She will face 
Democratic state Controller Gray Davis in the lieutenant governor's race in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wright reported a balance of $9,839 at the end of June, with $105,653 in 
outstanding debts. Davis, on the other hand, had a whopping $2.3 million in 
cash on hand, with $14,231 in unpaid debts. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), who is running for state 
controller, spent $381,173 to win the GOP primary. He had $30,000 on hand for 
the fall campaign against Los Angeles businesswoman Kathleen Connell. Connell's 
financial report was not available. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor were financial reports available for Assemblywoman Paula L. Boland 
(R-Granada Hills) or her 19-year-old Democratic challenger, Josh Arce of 
Chatsworth. Boland's 38th Assembly District covers Simi Valley, Fillmore and 
portions of the western San Fernando Valley.

OXNARD HOUSES SEARCHED IN RAID TO DETER GANGS; CRIME: POLICE MAKE 15 ARRESTS. 
EVIDENCE IS SOUGHT IN RECENT SHOOTINGS AND BEATING AT A PARK. A GUN, KNIFE AND 
ARMOR-PIERCING BULLETS ARE SEIZED.

<P>
 As part of an ongoing effort to curb gang violence in Ventura County, police 
searched dozens of houses throughout Oxnard early Thursday and arrested 15 
people -- including three men suspected of a burglary in Thousand Oaks hours 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those targeted were suspected members of three local gangs, in whose 
homes police seized a .22-caliber handgun, a five-inch knife in a leather 
sheath, armor-piercing bullets, several baseball bats and a pair of bolt 
cutters considered burglary tools. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers also confiscated photographs, newspaper clippings of previous gang 
sweeps and notebooks scrawled with gang graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 One goal of the raids was to find evidence related to a spate of recent 
shootings and a serious beating last weekend in an Oxnard park. 
</P>
<P>
 To do that, police targeted for the first time members of a black street gang 
that they say has grown increasingly violent. Investigators believe the gang, 
which surfaced about five years ago and now has about 40 members, is 
responsible for 10 recent unsolved shootings and the beating at the park last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We find guns just about every time we stop them," said Oxnard Police Officer 
James Seitz during a 6 a.m. briefing before the operation. "With these guys, we 
can't emphasize officer safety enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all of the materials seized, police said they found little evidence 
related to the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the luck of the draw," said Oxnard Police Sgt. Chuck Hookstra, who 
spearheaded the raids. "They never know when we're going to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, police said past high-profile raids have had a chilling effect on gang 
violence, at least for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the youths targeted Thursday are considered hard-core gang members and 
have been arrested in connection with a serious gang crime, officials said. In 
all, Oxnard police gang files contain the names of about 2,500 suspected gang 
members, and more than 300 with strong ties to six Oxnard gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Police Chief Harold Hurtt said focusing on the most serious offenders 
sends a message discouraging youths with weaker ties to gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to reduce crime, you've got to lock up your known criminals 
-- bottom line," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And Probation Officer Santos Hernandez said the high-profile raids -- a staple 
of countywide gang suppression efforts for the past two years -- are needed 
because of the type of individuals involved and the violent nature of crimes 
they commit. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Oxnard police conducted a similar raid on a smaller scale. With 
assistance from other departments, officers swept through 14 homes, arrested 
one person and served written warnings to other gang members that future crimes 
would meet with stiffer penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's raids began at 7 a.m. with 50 officers from every police agency in 
the county fanning out across Oxnard in squad cars and unmarked vehicles. Eight 
teams of police and probation officers searched 39 homes of suspected gang 
members, all of whom had agreed to random searches as a condition of probation. 
</P>
<P>
 On Astoria Place in west Oxnard, a dozen officers surrounded a cream-and-gray 
home on a block of older tract houses with well-kept yards. Eight suspected 
members of the Black Mafia Gang, the group linked to the recent shootings, were 
ordered to sit outside while police searched the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidden beneath a pillow in the garage, officers found four credit cards 
reported stolen from a car in Thousand Oaks about 1 a.m. Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested three suspected gang members on suspicion of burglary. Two 
girls from Thousand Oaks, ages 13 and 14, were also arrested at the house on 
suspicion of being under the influence of crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 At various locations throughout the morning, six other people were arrested 
for violating their probation, one other person was arrested on a narcotics 
charge and two others were arrested on outstanding warrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by a police officer how he was doing, one man replied before ducking 
into the squad car: "I was fine until today." 
</P>
<P>
 About 90 minutes later on the south end of town, police knocked on a familiar 
door in the College Estates neighborhood. The house, a two-story stucco-trimmed 
home with peeling brown paint, has been raided by police at least twice before. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, officers seized guns and ammunition. This time, however, they 
found nothing to arrest the suspected Filipino gang member living at the 
address. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, police made no arrests at the house next door where a year earlier 
they had confiscated a semiautomatic assault rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later on Boston Way, a 58-year-old man wearing a T-shirt emblazoned 
with "U.S.A." watched as a half-dozen officers surrounded and then searched the 
house next door. 
</P>
<P>
 Police turned up no contraband and made no arrests, but the retired military 
officer said he appreciated the police attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he described the street as quiet in recent years, the man said he has 
watched the 25-year-old neighborhood steadily deteriorated and property values 
drop. He said he keeps guns inside for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got my own arsenal," he said, ticking off the half-dozen handguns and 
shotguns he owns. "They all know I've got guns and I've got an alarm."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; RESIDENTS ATTACK PLAN TO SELL BOWLING ALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON GRANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 100 angry Ojai residents and small-business owners denounced a plan 
to convert the city's only bowling alley into a Pay Less Drug Store outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten hundreds of signatures from people to keep the bowling alley," 
Ojai business owner Joy Grove told the Planning Commission on Wednesday."This 
will impact what's available to our children." 
</P>
<P>
 Grove, who owns a surplus store near Ojai Valley Bowl, is vice president of 
the 50-member Ojai Valley Retailers' Assn. Merchants from the group have joined 
forces with bowling enthusiasts and other residents who say their small town 
already lacks recreational opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Payne, a Pay Less real estate manager, said after the meeting that his 
company will not decide whether to submit a formal application to the city to 
buy the property from the Boersch Family Trust until next week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pay Less has agreed to buy the trust's 6,000-square-foot building if the 
city approves the chain's plan, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission took no formal action, but several members said the preliminary 
Pay Less proposal does not meet Ojai's standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners listened to a flurry of complaints from residents and 
small-business owners who argued that a Pay Less store will bring large trucks 
that will clog city streets. Some also complained that the large chain store 
would undersell independent merchants, putting them out of business. JASON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SEMINAR TO ADDRESS NEW PESTICIDE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Growers are invited to attend a free seminar that will bring them up-to- date 
on new federal regulations dealing with pesticide use and worker safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The seminar is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Aug. 18 in the lower plaza assembly 
auditorium at the Ventura County Government Center in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The talk will help farmers, nursery growers and greenhouse owners sort through 
regulations that became law in January, said horticulturist Julie Newman, an 
adviser in the Ventura office of the UC Cooperative Extension, a forum sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 People who harvest, for example, must undergo safety training, as well as 
those who spray pesticides, she said. And workers will have to wait longer to 
enter a field after it has been sprayed with pesticide, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration for the seminar begins at 8 a.m. on Aug. 18. The forum is 
expected to run for about two hours, Newman said. For more information, call 
Newman at 645-1459. KAY SAILLANT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MEINERS OAKS; MAN GETS 32 MONTHS IN FATAL CAR CRASH

<P>
 A Meiners Oaks man with a history of driving drunk was sentenced Thursday to 
32 months in prison for smashing his car into an approaching vehicle on 
California 33 in February and killing a 6-year-old Oxnard boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmund Castro pleaded guilty to vehicular manslaughter and felony drunk 
driving in May.The sentence was handed down by Ventura County Superior Court 
Judge Charles R. McGrath. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro, a 34-year-old professional speedway racer nicknamed "Fast Eddie," had 
a 0.13% blood-alcohol levelwhen his car crossed into the oncoming lane and 
struck a vehicle carrying five people, including Sergio Ramirez, 6, authorities 
said. The state's blood-alcohol limit is 0.08%. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergio, who had been riding in the back seat, suffered major head injuriesand 
died later at Ojai Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cold, hard, cruel fact is this gentleman has been making these choices 
for a long, long time," Deputy Dist. Atty. Donna K. Gissing told the judge, 
urging a prison term of four years and eight months. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to two prior drunk-driving-related convictions, Gissing added, "He's 
had his wake-up calls." 
</P>
<P>
 Castro's lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Bryant J. Fitzpatrick, acknowledged 
that his client had an alcohol problem but said he has stopped drinking and has 
taken responsibility for the crash and Sergio's death. Fitzpatrick disputed a 
probation report that accused Castro of blaming the crash on mechanical 
defects, wind gusts and the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "He pled guilty; that's not an excuse," the defense lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing, Sergio's mother, Clara Servin, said she was glad to have 
the case completed. "I feel that he should have gone to prison for life, even 
though that won't bring back Sergio," said Servin, flanked by her two surviving 
sons, Charles, 11, and Daniel, 9. DWAYNE BRAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: RED CROSS CHAPTER AIDS RWANDA RELIEF

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a slow start, the Ventura County chapter of the American Red Cross has 
raised more than $4,000 since July 20 in relief funds for Rwandan refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian E. Bolton, chapter executive director, said that donations have stepped 
up since world attention began to focus last month in the flight of more than 1 
million Rwandans into Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only received one donation of $40 until July 20," Bolton said. The chapter 
made its first Rwandan aid request May 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolton said people did not originally contribute because they thought 
"whatever they could do would not be enough to have an impact." 
</P>
<P>
 But that is not true, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody making a donation of $7 is going to provide enough food to feed one 
person for a month," he said. "For $70 we can treat 35 cholera patients to save 
their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Contributions should be sent to: "Rwanda Relief" c/o American Red Cross, P.O. 
Box 5850, Ventura 93005-5850. Or call 1-800-842-2200 to charge to Visa, 
MasterCard or American Express. DARYL KELLEY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: GROUP TO PURSUE PUBLIC SAFETY FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS JORDAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Law enforcement leaders and their supporters have agreed to pursue a ballot 
initiative as the best way to force Ventura County to spend more money on 
public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have a problem: They are too late to add a measure to November's 
ballot and do not want to wait a year for another countywide election. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Citizens for a Safe Ventura County say they plan to collect enough 
signatures to put the measure on a future ballot, then use the petitions to 
pressure the Board of Supervisors into accepting the proposal before it reaches 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as we have an initiative drafted, which should be 45 to 60 days, 
we'll be out there collecting signatures," group chairman Otto Stoll said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoll, Sheriff Larry Carpenter, Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury and officers 
of firefighter and deputy sheriff's unions have met in support of the strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would restrict use of special Proposition 172 sales taxes that 
voters approved last year. Ventura County supervisors pledged all the revenue 
to enhance public safety, but then shifted about $1.2 million to the coroner's 
office and legal services for children. PHYLLIS JORDAN

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; FATHER HELD AFTER BARRICADING CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 33-year-old Oxnard man has been arrested after holding police at bay for 
five hours, threatening to kill his four children and shattering the windows of 
his house, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Everett Luna was taken into custody about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday after a 
police SWAT team forced its way into the house and found Luna asleep in his 
living room. 
</P>
<P>
 Luna was booked into Ventura County Jail on suspicion of vandalism and willful 
cruelty to a child. He was being held in lieu of $5,000 bail, according to the 
jail watch commander. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard police said the incident began with a fight between Luna and his mother 
at the family's home in the 500 block of East Yucca Street. When officers 
arrived about 6:35 p.m., Luna had barricaded himself inside and was threatening 
to kill his children, ages 2 to 10, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 As police tried to negotiate with Luna, three of his children escaped. Angry 
that police would not send the children back into the house, Luna began 
destroying the interior of the house and smashing out glass windows, according 
to Sgt. Dan Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 The SWAT team rescued the fourth child while entering the home to arrest Luna.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: MOORPARK; CITY FAILS TO FIND A FIRST-TIME BUYER 
FOR HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After six months of trying, the city of Moorpark has given up on finding a 
qualified moderate-income buyer interested in purchasing a three-bedroom house 
owned by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first time that the city has tried to sell a house through its 
first-time home-buyers program.The house was one of five meant for first-time 
buyers that were built in 1990 by Griffin Homes in its roughly 400-home Campus 
Hills development. 
</P>
<P>
 To assist in purchasing the houses, the city at the time offered a $30,000 
loan to each of five families. In December of last year, however, the city 
learned that a bank was about to foreclose on one of the homeowners, and it 
purchased the house -- valued at about $200,000 -- for slightly more than 
$180,000, Senior City Planner Deborah Traffenstedt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since March, the city has tried to find qualified buyers for the house, 
Traffenstedt said. To qualify, buyers had to show that they had never owned a 
home before and that they had a moderate income -- roughly $68,000 for a family 
of four -- she said. Five families applied for the program, but none qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were various reasons that they didn't qualify," she said, adding that 
the biggest obstacle was their inability to qualify for a bank loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will now open the bidding to all comers and plans on selling the 
1,326-square-foot house for about $190,000 to $200,000. The city has spent 
$6,200 since May for insurance, utilities and making improvements. Interested 
buyers should contact the city at 529-6864. SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: SIMI VALLEY; TRAIN SEVERS FOOT OF SLEEPING 
TRANSIENT

<P>
 A passing freight train cut off a transient's foot Thursday in Simi Valley as 
he slept beside the tracks, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors at Simi Valley Hospital said they were unable to save Kevin 
Asunction's foot, which was almost completely severed shortly after 1 p.m. as 
he napped near the train tunnel through Santa Susana Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we know is he says he was sleeping near the tracks," said Simi Valley 
Police Lt. Don Austin. "He put a foot up on the tracks and he got run over by a 
freight train." 
</P>
<P>
 Asunction apparently was able to crawl to a building nearby for help, and 
someone called an ambulance for him, Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pruner Ambulance rushed him to the hospital, but in several hours of surgery, 
doctors were unable to reattach his foot, which had been crushed in the mishap, 
said JoLynn de la Torre, a hospital spokeswoman. Asunction was listed in stable 
condition late Thursday. MACK REED

EAST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: THOUSAND OAKS; COUNCIL APPROVES GARBAGE BILL 
INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks residents will see their monthly garbage bills jump by 2.6% next 
year since the City Council has approved new franchise agreements with three 
trash disposal firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-cents-a-month increase in residential rates for next year will boost 
the average family's bill to $18.05 a month.The commercial rate will jump about 
3%, so a business filling one large bin a week would pay $94.40 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The franchise agreements approved by the City Council on Tuesday differ from 
the traditional Thousand Oaks trash contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in city history, the garbage haulers have secured a 
multiyear agreement, good for five years. Also, their rates will be adjusted 
automatically each year to match inflation, so the council will no longer have 
to hold public hearings for every fee hike. 
</P>
<P>
 The streamlined process should save the city $50,000 a year, plus considerable 
staff and council time, according to Carolyn Greene of the Public Works 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with next year's 2.6% increase, Thousand Oaks residents still pay one of 
the lowest trash collection rates in Ventura County, Greene said. The council 
voted 4 to 1 to accept the new contracts, with Councilwoman Elois Zeanah 
dissenting. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: COUNCIL ADDS POWERS TO PUSH MALL PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned that unreasonable demands from tenants could jeopardize the 
$30-million Janss Mall renovation, Thousand Oaks City Council members have 
voted themselves the right to use the power of condemnation to push the project 
forward if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 All council members said they would be reluctant to use condemnation to force 
any tenant to accept the renovation plans. But on a 3-2 vote, they reserved the 
right to take such action. Councilwomen Elois Zeanah and Jaime Zukowski 
dissented. 
</P>
<P>
 Mall owner Bill Janss requested council members to publicly affirm their right 
to initiate condemnation proceedings should his negotiations with tenants reach 
an impasse. He and other mall owners would reimburse the city for all costs 
incurred during a condemnation proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 In initiating a condemnation, city officials would probably focus on one 
narrow provision in several tenants' leases: a phrase guaranteeing anchor 
stores the right to veto any renovation project. 
</P>
<P>
 The city would appraise the value of that veto right and then buy it in order 
to break a logjam in negotiations and allow the renovations to proceed, City 
Atty. Mark Sellers said. "Otherwise," Sellers wrote in a memo to the council, 
"these tenants could unreasonably frustrate this important redevelopment 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
 The council's action angered some tenants, who believe the Janss Mall 
landlords will use the threat of condemnation as a club to force agreement 
during touchy negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 John Murray, an attorney for Toys R Us, said company executives fear that "the 
developer will not enter into any constructive dialogue with Toys in the 
future" now that condemnation is an option. 
</P>
<P>
 But condemnation could be used to benefit some tenants, especially the owners 
of small stores, Sellers said. Under federal law, tenants who sell their leases 
can shelter their profits from taxes for three years while they seek a new 
location. They get the tax break only by showing a letter threatening 
condemnation. STEPHANIE SIMON

PANEL URGES FUNDING TO DEVELOP LAND FOR CITY PARKS; THOUSAND OAKS: OFFICIALS 
DISCUSS POSSIBLE SOURCES OF MONEY, INCLUDING EARMARKING TAX DOLLARS FOR 
PROJECTS AND TURNING TO DEVELOPERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Thousand Oaks may turn to developers, or even homeowners, to help pay for the 
long overdue conversion of hundreds of acres of vacant city parkland into 
baseball diamonds and playgrounds, city officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Development on the parkland, most of which consists of open fields currently 
being used for soccer, has been stymied by the Conejo Recreation and Park 
District's lack of money for maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we can pay to plant the grass, but we can't afford to mow or water 
it," said district planner Jim Gilmore. "Right now we're using all of the land 
that we can afford to maintain." 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting of the General Plan Review Committee on Thursday, top city 
officials said the City Council should step in and find ways to pay for park 
improvements.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of field space out there, and it's just not being utilized," 
said Councilwoman Judy Lazar, one of four committee members. "I think it's 
clear from residents of this city that this should be a priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the committee discussed several possible solutions to the problem, 
including earmarking existing tax dollars for parks and turning to developers 
for money.  
</P>
<P>
 Developers are typically asked to contribute the land for parks when a project 
is proposed, but not for the funds to maintain them. Now, said council and 
committee member Elois Zeanah, the city should start asking for both. 
</P>
<P>
 I n response to that proposal, local business leaders said they felt 
developers were contributing enough.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's clear that developers are paying much more than their own way," 
said Thousand Oaks architect Neal Scribner. "I don't think the law will allow 
much more." 
</P>
<P>
 If residents want parks and recreation facilities, "they are going to have to 
figure out how to pay for (the amenities) themselves," Scribner said. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Planner John Prescott said the city has made similar agreements with 
developers in the past, just on a smaller scale. 
</P>
<P>
 In agreements with developers of the Shapell and Lang Ranch projects, Prescott 
said the builders agreed not only to donate the land but to develop the 
facility as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But because there is so little land remaining for development in the city, 
Prescott added that the committee ought to search for other sources of funding 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 One possibility, Lazar said, was to tap into the city's bedroom tax, which was 
used in part to purchase Conejo Creek Park North. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee suggested that the current $100 to $200 tax, which is levied on 
residents based on the number of bedrooms in their home, be spent on specific 
recreation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we could recommend that the council earmark this money to specific 
projects, so we could start to see improvements," Zeanah said. 
</P>
<P>
 If that money is divided properly between park improvements and a reserve fund 
for park maintenance, Gilmore said the plan could be successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see them consider that," Gilmore said. "I think any way that (the 
recreation and park district) and the city can work together will be beneficial 
to the public." 
</P>
<P>
 The General Plan Review Committee, which convenes monthly to discuss revision 
of the city's blueprint for the future, is made up of Zeanah, Lazar and 
Planning Commissioners Irving Wasserman and Marilyn Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members agreed Thursday to compile their ideas about improving the 
parks and present them to the council later this year. Undeveloped Parks in

IN SIMI VALLEY, ACTIVIST DUO GIVES NEIGHBORHOOD GRAFFITI THE BRUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley resident Erwin Dreger hates graffiti so much he keeps a tub of 
paint, coveralls and a long-armed roller stashed in his van so he can 
immediately censor the offending scrawl wherever he goes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am passionate in my feelings against graffiti," Dreger, 58, said one recent 
morning, as he slathered a thick beige coating over a black-and-red jumble of 
marks near the Arroyo Simi. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many decent, productive people in Simi Valley, and we should not 
be forced to live with this garbage," said the self-employed upholsterer. "For 
me it's not enough to wait for somebody else to come along and get rid of it. I 
have to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreger is not alone. At the urging of the city, a growing number of Simi 
Valley residents are taking brushes into their own hands in the ongoing battle 
to keep their neighborhoods graffiti-free. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting more and more people coming in to get the paint," said John 
Watring, assistant director of public works. "People get really excited when 
they find out there's something they can do about the graffiti." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday morning, Dreger bumped into fellow graffiti buster and avid bicyclist 
Larry Hainline while on patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair, who had never met before, exchanged gleeful introductions and 
immediately began comparing notes about graffiti styles and painting methods. 
</P>
<P>
 Hainline, 66, a retired electrical engineer, cruises up and down the paved 
Arroyo Simi by bicycle each day, taking note of the graffiti so he can return 
with paint. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dreger favors a more casual approach, throwing white coveralls over his linen 
slacks and shirt and setting to work immediately.  
</P>
<P>
 "Did you see what they did up on the bridge over the weekend?" Hainline asked. 
He launched into a detailed description of the scrawls marring the bridge over 
the Arroyo Simi, south of Royal Avenue, since reduced by him to innocuous beige 
splotches. 
</P>
<P>
 Hainline and Dreger then discussed the fresh graffiti on a nearby traffic 
signal, sharing their distress at not being allowed to paint the markings out 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The city prohibits residents from painting over graffiti on city streets, 
leaving the work to an experienced contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 But for private property and less visible spots like the Arroyo Simi, the city 
welcomes residents' help and provides an unlimited supply of recycled paint in 
five-gallon buckets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was anger that drove Hainline to arm himself with paint. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got fed up," he said. "The people who paint this graffiti are 
subhumans, more like animals that spray their urine on every bush and fireplug 
to let others know they were there." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months the city has stepped up efforts to wipe the problem out.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council passed a tough graffiti ordinance in January, making parents 
liable for up to $10,000 in damages and fines resulting from their children's 
graffiti. The council also banned the sale of spray paint, etching tools and 
wide-tip markers to minors. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the council authorized hiring a contractor to scour the streets 
for graffiti. And the city set up a hot line for graffiti reports, offering a 
$1,000 reward to people who provide information that helps arrest and convict 
vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But reports of graffiti continue to climb. From January to May of 1993, the 
Simi Valley Police Department recorded 1,450 graffiti reports, Sgt. Rex Jones 
said. For the same period this year the number rose to 1,607. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreger remains undaunted. "Anything I can do to slow it down, anything to let 
them know we are not giving up, that makes it worthwhile," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Hainline agreed. "It's a little frustrating to keep covering over the same 
spot each day," he said. "But I do feel like I'm making a difference." FYI 
</P>
<P>

SUSPECTED SHOPLIFTER SHOT OUTSIDE STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON GRANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 16-year-old suspected shoplifter was shot by an Oxnard store manager 
Thursday after the youth left the market and was confronted by store employees, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth, identified only as an Oxnard resident, was taken by ambulance to 
St. John's Regional Medical Center, where authorities refused to comment on his 
condition at the request of his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Police did not identify the boy because of his age. 
</P>
<P>
 Store manager Ibrahim Himideh, 33, shot the youth with a small-caliber 
handgun. Police said the teen-ager was holding a knife, but exactly what 
prompted the manager to fire is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth was confronted by several employees of Oxnard Ranch Market on 
Pleasant Valley Road after they allegedly saw him pick up merchandise and leave 
without paying, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Himideh said in an interview that he was trying to protect his employees when 
he shot the youth. But he would not comment on the circumstances immediately 
before he fired. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the sudden he reaches into his pants and pulls out what seems like a gun 
to one of my employees," the manager said. "So my employee started screaming, 
'It's a gun, it's a gun.' So I ran outside and see this guy basically flinging 
this knife left and right so he can get away." 
</P>
<P>
 "I seen this huge knife in his hand," he said, "and I was under the assumption 
that he had maybe a gun in his other hand. . . . Obviously, someone's life was 
at risk." JASON GRANT

THREAT OF SUITS MAY KILL PLAN TO LIMIT HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The threat of lawsuits is prompting a majority of Moorpark City Council 
members to consider backing away from a proposed growth-control ordinance that 
would limit the number of homes built each year within city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has been warned by a building industry group that if the city 
adopts the new ordinance a lawsuit will follow.  
</P>
<P>
 The city of Oceanside recently lost a six-year legal battle over its 
slow-growth law to the Building Industry Assn. of Southern California. 
Oceanside spent $2 million defending its law -- called Proposition A, which 
limited the number of homes built each year in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to the Oceanside case, building industry representatives told the 
Moorpark City Council on Wednesday night that city officials would lose a legal 
challenge against the slow-growth law they are now drafting.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question about it," said Mayor Paul Lawrason. "If you read the 
case it looks as though numerical caps may be on their way out. I think we will 
all have to step back and take a look at this ordinance. We may have to take an 
entirely different approach here." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Lawrason, Councilmen Scott Montgomery and Bernardo Perez are 
having second thoughts about numerical caps on building permits that could 
subject the city to a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft ordinance was drawn up during a yearlong process by an ad hoc 
committee of council members, planners, developers and local residents. It is 
meant to take the place of the city's existing slow-growth law, called Measure 
F, which expires in December, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 As drafted, the ordinance would limit the number of building permits issued 
each year to 250 dwellings. The strict limit on building permits matches the 
projected growth outlined in the city's General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet supporters argue that the slow-growth law would be gutted if the council 
removes the numerical limits on building permits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know about the potential changes. I just know I support what was 
originally recommended by the committee," said Roseann Mikos of the Ventura 
County Environmental Coalition's Moorpark chapter. "It's clear that the people 
in this town want effective managed growth." 
</P>
<P>
 Her views are supported by Councilmen John Wozniak and Patrick Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 But builders argue that the law is unfair to them, said Dee Zinke, executive 
director of the Building Industry Assn.'s Ventura chapter. Zinke said existing 
environmental controls and planning procedures guard against uncontrolled 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She stressed that placing "arbitrary" numerical limits on the number of homes 
built each year was unnecessary as well as legally indefensible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't believe they can defend this ordinance," Zinke said. "It's not 
prudent for them to move forward on this. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically there's a real vacuum of information out there," she said. "People 
are under the false perception that when the economy turns around there will be 
a huge boom, but that's just not the reality of development today." 
</P>
<P>
 William Fulton, a Ventura-based urban planner and writer, said although he 
does not generally support numerical caps limiting growth, he believed Moorpark 
could legally set limits on growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not quite sure if it's an indefensible law -- as the builders argue," he 
said. "It sounds more like the question of whether the marketplace should 
control the pace of building or whether a law should meter growth from year to 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Fulton said studies comparing development in Simi Valley before it adopted a 
growth control ordinance and Thousand Oaks, which had an ordinance, showed the 
laws had little effect on overall development. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He said growth control ordinances have a symbolic value in a community. "It 
gives cities the feeling that they control the ball, but the outcome is not 
going to be that much different whether or not you have a cap." 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything else, Fulton said, the pace of growth is determined by the 
underlying politics in a community. Public attitudes toward growth, he said, 
are usually reflected on city councils and planning commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Councilman Perez agrees that the limits in the draft ordinance may go 
too far, he said it's important to renew the city's growth control ordinance in 
some form. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we get with an extension of Measure F is a comfort zone for people," 
Perez said. "Despite what has been said I think that Measure F has worked."

ARTICLE REINFORCED A MISCONCEPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am a science teacher who constantly attempts to dispel myths concerning 
evolution and how organisms change over time. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore I was disappointed in your July 28 article concerning the pygmy 
mammoth fossil found in the Channel Islands.The article said that once the 
woolly mammoths were on the islands "they began to shrink." A paleontologist 
was quoted as saying, "When large animals stay on an island they usually become 
smaller." 
</P>
<P>
 People need to understand that animals do not just "shrink" and "become 
smaller" for lack of anything better to do on a small island. In reality, if it 
is beneficial for the smaller of the species to survive, they will reproduce 
with their small genes and create more small animals. The larger ones will 
become extinct as will their large genes, thus creating a new population of 
smaller organisms over time. 
</P>
<P>
 This simple concept is the basis of evolution and natural selection. I am 
positive Jim Mead, the paleontologist quoted, was speaking in layman's terms. 
But the article should have clarified his statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea that organisms spontaneously modify themselves is such a common 
misconception that as an educator I am frustrated to see it constantly 
reinforced.

SPECIAL INTERESTS WIN IN PORT HUENEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What is wrong with Washington is what is wrong with Port Hueneme. After the 
voters reject a tax increase, the City Council quickly and stealthily votes one 
in anyway.The message is clear: The citizens just don't know what is good for 
them. Once again, special interests win and the taxpayer has yet another burden 
to support the insatiable appetite of government. 
</P>
<P>
 (The "Save Our Police" crowd was well-organized and spent a lot of money to 
persuade the voters that the city just has to have its very own Police 
Department). The only thing saving the taxpayer was the two-thirds requirement 
to pass a tax increase the people of California had previously voted into place 
-- a measure passed to help protect citizens against well-organized, 
big-spending, special interests. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the "Save Our Police" crowd appealed to the City Council for a special 
utilities tax to the tune of $500,000 a year, the council agreed. Not a single 
nay vote. Sounds a lot like how things work in Washington. The bureaucrats know 
what is best for us whether we like it or not.  
</P>
<P>
 It is time to "Save the City" and vote the bums out.

POWERLESS TO FIGHT THE ELECTRIC CARS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a few visionaries seem to regard the electric car as somewhat of a 
panacea for smog problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Not I. I see it quite differently. I get a nightmarish picture in my mind of 
discarded (possibly acid-leaking) batteries stacked higher than the pyramids of 
Egypt in our nation's landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 And I foresee the necessity for building ever-more electrical power plants for 
recharging batteries. Otherwise, the inevitable brownouts could occur at 
over-capacitated plants. That means the use of extra fuels (of various types) 
to operate the turbines in those new plants -- plants that would belch out 
smokestack emissions of dubious quality. 
</P>
<P>
 A tongue-in-cheek conjecture? Perhaps.

FIRST GAME VERY NEARLY A NIGHTMARE; BASKETBALL: U.S. TRAILS SPAIN AT ONE POINT 
IN FIRST HALF BEFORE PULLING AWAY FOR 115-100 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The question before the 1994 World Championship of Basketball started was 
whether Dream Team II could beat the original Dream Team that won the 1992 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 When the U.S. team trailed late in the first half Thursday night, the question 
was whether it could beat Spain, fifth in the European championships and a 
41-point loser to Dream Team I in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Dream Team II went on to win its first-round, Pool A game, 115-100, behind the 
outside shooting of Joe Dumars and Reggie Miller. But the ease with which Spain 
scored on the Americans leaves some doubt about how the heavy gold medal 
favorites will fare the rest of the 11-day tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumars scored 21 points and Miller had 20 for the Americans, who pulled away 
in the second half as Spanish Coach Manuel Sainz benched several of the players 
who did so well in the first 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumars, the only U.S. team member with an NBA championship ring, scored 12 
points in the first 10:07. When his three-pointer with 9:53 left in the first 
half gave the United States a 34-22 advantage, the Americans looked 
unstoppable. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the next four minutes, the Spaniards dominated, outscoring the U.S. 
team 20-7 for a 42-41 edge with 5:26 left. Backup forward Alberto Herreros 
scored eight of his 11 first-half points in the run, including a shocking 
three-pointer that put Spain ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 The slim advantage lasted just six seconds, however, as Kevin Johnson 
converted a three-point play that put the United States ahead to stay. 
Johnson's free throw with 3.7 seconds left made it 59-51 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 The original Dream Team, led by Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Charles 
Barkley, had one brief first-half scare at the Olympics, trailing Croatia 25-23 
with 9:44 left in the gold-medal game. The Americans went on to win that game 
by 32. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain trailed just 62-55 early in the second half before the Americans pulled 
away with a 16-0 run capped by two three-pointers from Miller and one by 
Dumars, who had three 3s in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The burst gave Dream Team II a 78-55 lead with 14:10 left, and it went on to 
lead 99-74 before Spain closed to 110-98 with 2:37 left behind Jordi 
Villacampa, who scored 23 of his 28 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Antonio Orenga 14 points for Spain. Herreros did not play in the second 
half, nor did Ferran Martinez, who had 10 first-half points. Basketball Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Ortiz scored 19 points, leading six Puerto Rico players in double figures 
in a 102-74 rout of Egypt in a first-round game at the World Championship of 
Basketball. Puerto Rico was the gold-medal team in the Goodwill Games last 
month. . . . Dino Radja had 25 points and eight rebounds to lead Croatia's NBA 
frontline in an 85-65 victory over Cuba in its opener. Radja, who plays for the 
Boston Celtics, was 11 for 16 from the field and was joined on the dominating 
frontline by Toni Kukoc of the Chicago Bulls, who had 11 points and 12 
rebounds, and Stojan Vrankovic, who played for the Celtics and had 14 points 
and 12 rebounds. . . . Andrew Gaze's free throw with 13 seconds to play was 
Australia's only point of the final six minutes, but it still hung on for an 
87-85 victory over South Korea. Gaze had 31 points. . . . Panagiotis Fassoulas 
had 18 points and 10 rebounds to lead Greece to a 68-58 victory over Germany.

RISING DISCO FEVER; BOOGIE KNIGHTS IS ONE GROUP CASHING IN ON AN UPSURGE OF 
CAMPY NOSTALGIA IN THE VALLEY.

 Robbie Schwyzer was a junior high school kid in the 1970s, a little rocker in 
a "Disco Sucks" T-shirt. But Vinnie Guiseppi Tortelli is a singing- dancing 
drummer with perfect hair and tight polyester pants. He's a crusader in a band 
called the Boogie Knights, trapped in a rhythm and a decade once considered 
unmentionable. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Vinnie is just a disguise, of course, a role for Schwyzer to play from 
behind the drum kit, pounding out the simple beats to such timeless titles as 
"Disco Inferno" and "Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?" He's here at FM Station this night 
with his pals in the Boogie Knights, waiting for the moment he can step out to 
center stage under his John Travolta wig for a few glorious, feverish dance 
steps for the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minute we get in the wigs and somewhat in disguise, we don't care about 
embarrassment or anything," Schwyzer, 26, says of the band and their horrifying 
retro outfits. "It's kind of strange. You can let go and not care." 
</P>
<P>
 This weekly Wednesday night gig at the North Hollywood rock club is only one 
stop on a never-ending tour of campy nostalgia and driving beats. On Thursdays 
they're back at Pelican's Retreat in Calabasas. At the Metro Bay Club in 
Ventura on Saturdays. And then there's that free airplane ride every Sunday to 
play for some particularly rabid fans at Arizona State University in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing new about the '70s revival, the bell-bottoms, the pounding beats, the 
Afros, the long, goofy hair. In Hollywood, the club 1970 was spinning old 
funk-pop records barely a decade after the original era was declared dead and 
buried. But now it's spread to the San Fernando Valley, the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think disco has ever really died," Schwyzer insists. After all, '80s 
acts like Wham! and Berlin often incorporated prominent beats to massive 
success on dance floors and pop radio. But more important, the actual funk 
tracks recorded by the likes of Parliament, the Sugar Hill Gang, The Stylistics 
etc. are being sampled prominently in new chart-topping albums by Snoop Doggy 
Dogg, Ice Cube and Dr. Dre, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're bringing it back," Dave Hewitt, Pelican's talent director, says of 
the new hip-hop artists. "And they're opening up the eyes of a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, the weekly disco-themed night -- with DJ John Lorre spinning 
old records between the Boogie Knights sets -- is the busiest night of the week 
for the 500-capacity club, with a long line waiting to get inside. "If you 
don't get out there by 11 you might as well take a seat outside," Hewitt says. 
"You're not going to get in." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Butler, alias Boogie Knights guitarist J. J. Vernon Woods, says: "For a 
while it was cool to hate disco. The generation now either hates it fondly, or 
they just like it. Even if they hated it back then, they enjoy looking back and 
hating it now." 
</P>
<P>
 "For a younger crowd it's just danceable music," says Schwyzer. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeding this interest, late-night and cable television is flooded with 
commercials hawking album compilations of "all the hits" from the era writer 
Tom Wolfe dubbed The Me Decade. Meanwhile, at the Insomnia Cafe in Sherman 
Oaks, owner and former club DJ John Dunn has launched Boob Tube '70s TV Night 
every Monday. There, customers can sip their coffee, juice, tea and other 
nonalcoholic beverage to the soothing video images of "The Brady Bunch," "The 
Partridge Family," "Mannix," "Mission Impossible" and other appropriate 
television series on three 17-inch monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn says that he's "absolutely" had no problem mixing campy '70s culture with 
the Insomnia's inherent bohemian groove. "We play the 'Saturday Night Fever' 
soundtrack a lot," Dunn says. "The flavor is unique, and it's tongue in cheek." 
</P>
<P>
 He enjoyed a particularly close view of the disco era beginning in 1977, when 
he was still a North Hollywood High School student, starting a career working 
as a club DJ. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so easy to put up a mirror ball, put on some searchlights, some police 
lights and have an incredible dance," Dunn, now 35, says of those days. "The 
whole feeling of that sort of free love, alcohol, pot smoking culture of the 
'70s made for the greatest parties. Even into the '80s nobody was really 
thinking about tomorrow, or what their responsibilities were. That's really 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids today have their rap parties and their raves. But it isn't like it was 
then. There were no fights, no problems. They were just into dancing." 
</P>
<P>
 The sound of the '70s amounted to much more than the singles Donna Summer and 
other dance music artists were releasing then. 
</P>
<P>
 And new bands like the Black Crowes and such longtime survivors as Aerosmith 
offer a harder-edged version of the era. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's little of that corner of the '70s in the Boogie Knights 
repertoire. The quartet, which also includes singer Adam Shore, 26 (alias 
Calvin Lywn), and bassist Doug McRoy, 30 (alias Corderious Washington), sticks 
close to the Studio 54 songbook. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now people are looking back and realizing a lot of it was real good music," 
says guitarist Butler. "There were really good beats, and there was that 
comical aspect to the lyrics." 
</P>
<P>
 The band is now making plans to record an album of its own, with hopes of 
writing some new disco material with the flavor of the original songs. 
</P>
<P>
 But that may not be as easy as that at first sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to relate to what disco was," says Schwyzer. "You had to be in 
that era, when it was just dance and party. It's weird to get into the mind of 
people who used to write disco music. Even as simplistic as it is, it's all 
about a different vibe." 
</P>
<P>
 The revival won't last forever, of course, Hewitt acknowledges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're actually catching it close to its peak, to the mountain top," he says. 
"Hundreds of people are coming Thursday nights. It's taken about a year." 
</P>
<P>
 But he's already signed a band, set to start performing in September, that 
plays hit music from the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The KROQ stuff is going to come back. I'm talking Duran Duran, Soft Cell, 
Flock of Seagulls. I'm going to bring a band in called Up All Night to play 
flashback new wave. That's going to be the next phase." 
</P>
<P>
 At Insomnia, Dunn expects much the same, just as revivals of '50s and '60s 
music and style each had their turns. The '80s are only inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Should be scary," he says. Where and When

CISNEROS AND RIORDAN TOUR 'GHOST TOWNS'; EARTHQUAKE: HUD SECRETARY SAYS THAT 
CONGRESS WILL APPROVE REDISTRIBUTION OF $225 MILLION TO LEND FOR REBUILDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros and Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan 
toured San Fernando Valley "ghost towns" Thursday, drawing attention to a new 
strategy to jump-start repair work in apartment neighborhoods with heavy quake 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidestepping rubble and ducking under the roof of a partly collapsed garage, 
the two leaders met the owners of two Granada Hills apartment complexes, 
apartments that city officials say might never be rebuilt without the funds the 
administration hopes to shift from other earthquake programs into housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ghost towns" are concentrations of uninhabited apartment buildings condemned 
for quake damage that attract squatters and become centers for drug use, gang 
gatherings and other crimes, which city officials fear will drag down the 
surrounding neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to an appeal by Riordan, President Clinton earlier this month 
asked Congress to redistribute $225 million from highway and school 
retrofitting projects to the city governments of Los Angeles and Santa Monica, 
to be lent to owners of damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds would go into 30-year, no-interest loans with no payments due for 
the first six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the reallocation has yet to receive congressional approval, Cisneros 
said he is confident that "Congress is on board," and that the money will start 
to reach local officials in "a matter of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan, accompanied by northeast Valley Councilman Richard Alarcon, responded 
by praising the Clinton Administration for its quick response to his request, 
made "about a week ago," for the extra housing funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, Cisneros said the Riordan Administration's deft handling of 
earthquake relief gave him great confidence in entrusting the money to the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejecting criticism that the money is being taken from other urgently needed 
projects, Cisneros said it is needed to address a crisis that could leave the 
city with permanent blight and cause long-term damage to its economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see that this is uninhabitable, unacceptable for the long run," 
Cisneros said, standing before the eerie facade of a broken 69-unit building on 
Kingsbury Street that leans in all directions, exactly as it did the day after 
the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just put yourself in the shoes of an apartment owner who had tenants who are 
gone after the damage," Cisneros said. "They can no longer make bank payments 
and have no choice without help but to walk away. The loser when an apartment 
owner walks away from an apartment like this is the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles housing officials have identified 13 "ghost towns," either 
individual blocks of apartment buildings and condominiums or whole 
neighborhoods that have become virtually uninhabited because so many buildings 
suffered such extensive damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are concerned that these areas will attract crime and squatters and 
remain blighted for years to come if the owners of the buildings do not receive 
adequate assistance to rebuild. Because the owners' equity in some of the 
buildings is so small, they may not qualify for Small Business Administration 
loans. In other cases, the damage far exceeds the SBA's limit of $1.5 million 
per building. 
</P>
<P>
 The new money -- $200 million to Los Angeles and $25 million to Santa Monica 
-- will help rebuild about 17,000 units, "about half the number unable to get 
the necessary funds," Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual no-interest loans would be used to supplement other sources of 
capital, Los Angeles city housing consultant Rich Wallach said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the 69-unit building on Kingsbury, for example, the rebuilding 
package would consist of $2 million in federal loans, $1 million in interest 
write-downs by the bank and $250,000 cash put in by the owner, Wallach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, during a meeting with the Los Angeles Times editorial 
board, Cisneros said he believes more attention should be paid to the 
priorities of future earthquake preparedness to minimize the loss of life. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was moved by a visit to a school room where light fixtures fell on 
desks and shards of broken glass were embedded in chairs, a scene that 
illustrated the potential loss of life if an earthquake occurs on a school day. 
</P>
<P>
 But there aren't enough resources to protect every structure from the great 
potential power of quakes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, Cisneros said, he wants the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development to take the lead in evaluating all aspects of earthquake 
preparedness -- from local ordinances to the federal budget -- to give the 
highest priority to measures that will save lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went back to Washington convinced that we need to look at areas where for 
the least amount of money we could save the most lives if this were to happen 
at an hour when people were in office buildings and children were in schools," 
he said.

LOCAL AGENCIES COPE WITH FEAR OF TERRORISM; ENCINO: JEWISH AND ABORTION-RIGHTS 
GROUPS INCREASE PRECAUTIONS AFTER BOMBINGS ABROAD AND SLAYING OF A PHYSICIAN IN 
FLORIDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With recent attacks against Jews abroad and doctors in Florida clearly 
weighing on their minds, Jewish leaders and abortion-rights activists said 
Thursday they are keeping their fears in check while taking precautions against 
acts of terrorism here. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anti-Defamation League sponsored a security seminar Thursday in Encino, 
and abortion-rights groups said they are confident that their network of clinic 
protectors would fend off trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear of terrorism has been heightened by anti-Jewish bombings that killed or 
wounded more than 100 people in Buenos Aires, Panama City and London last month 
and by the second fatal shooting of an abortion-clinic physician, which 
occurred in Florida last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials with both the FBI and the Los Angeles Police Department 
said they know of no immediate danger to synagogues in Los Angeles, which has 
the nation's second-largest Jewish community, they advised Jewish groups to 
remain on alert and outlined several precautions, including watching for 
suspicious visitors and packages. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FBI has received no information regarding any imminent attack in Los 
Angeles," Special Agent David Staretz told representatives of Jewish groups 
gathered at Valley Beth Shalom Synagogue in Encino. "That's not to say you 
shouldn't remain on alert." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Jewish and abortion-rights groups said Thursday that they 
are paying more attention to security measures, but also carrying on with their 
daily affairs and refusing to cave in to fear. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a number of questions about whether to remove Jewish signs" from 
synagogues, schools and businesses, said Mary Krasn, director of the ADL's San 
Fernando Valley branch. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I've given them an unequivocal no. At no time should we hide our 
identities or shrink from the world. But we also need to review our security 
procedures," Krasn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Abortion-rights activists take a similar stance. "Right now, all seems to be 
quiet, but we remain vigilant," said Katherine Spillar, national coordinator 
for the Feminist Majority Foundation, which runs clinic defense projects around 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, Spillar said in a telephone interview from Washington, clinics 
have reported no death threats or other unusual activity. 
</P>
<P>
 She attributed the calm to a history of abortion-rights activism in the Los 
Angeles area, crediting the deterrent effect of "10,000 people in that area, 
literally, that we've trained in clinic defense and who've come out to clinics 
over the last five years whenever needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Josie Corning, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Los Angeles, agreed, 
saying the nonprofit group's network of volunteer protectors is standing by, 
although there have been no signs of violence so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Corning added that Planned Parenthood began taking heavy security measures at 
its 11 Los Angeles clinics at least three years ago, when abortion foes such as 
Operation Rescue started becoming more violent. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Jewish groups have long been sensitive to violent attacks and the 
need for vigilance. But last month's flurry of terrorism, including the July 18 
bombing at a Buenos Aires Jewish center that left at least 96 people dead, 
renewed concern that Jews everywhere are targets. 
</P>
<P>
 After that attack and the bombings that followed, some Jewish groups in Los 
Angeles received threats, Krasn said Thursday. She declined to provide details 
but added, "As far as I know, none of the threats materialized." 
</P>
<P>
 At least one bomb threat was directed at the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum 
of Tolerance on Pico Boulevard, an LAPD spokeswoman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A police bomb squad was sent there on July 28 after a caller warned of 
explosives on the premises. Nothing was found and a man was later arrested and 
charged with two counts of making false bomb threats, said Officer Sandra 
Castello. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though it has not been targeted by specific threats, at least one Jewish 
organization has changed its habits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Intercoms with buzzer-activated locks to admit visitors have been in place at 
the United Jewish Appeal office in Sherman Oaks since the fund-raising group 
moved in last November. But it was only after a July 26 car bombing outside the 
Israeli Embassy in London that the UJA began using the security system, said 
administrative assistant Debby Bennett, who attended Thursday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Jewish groups represented included several synagogues, a cemetery, the 
Russian Community Center in West Los Angeles and the Jewish Family Service's 
Family Friends Project in North Hollywood, whose director expressed concern 
about the difficulty of screening visitors in the storefront walk-in operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are things to look for? Like the woman in London with the Harrod's bag?" 
asked Susan Forer-Dehrey, referring to the well-dressed, middle-aged woman seen 
leaving a car in London shortly before it exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no stereotype," replied Sean Ben-Menahem, a security consultant for 
the Jewish Federation Council. "For the next two weeks," he advised, "receive 
no off-the-street clients. Establish a system of appointments only." 
</P>
<P>
 "What about the Jewish High Holidays, which are a month away?" another guest 
wanted to know. "Could the police increase their patrols during that time? 
Should we increase security?" 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Capt. James McMurray of the Van Nuys Division suggested that 
congregations weigh what they can afford against how much of a threat they 
perceive. He added that police patrols are alerted to Jewish holiday dates and 
keep lists of potential hate-crime targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Betty Levy, director of B'nai B'rith Women's Pacific Southwest 
Region, wanted to know if her group should continue to publicize events. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben-Menahem suggested hiring guards for those events or using hand-held radios 
to keep tabs on guests, but otherwise carrying on as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't stop life," he said.

A CAUSE CELEB; ACTOR ED BEGLEY CRAMS FOR AN ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just the day before, environmentally vigilant actor Ed Begley Jr. stood before 
the five Los Angeles County supervisors, arguing that there would be no need 
for more landfills if everyone followed his example and discarded only enough 
trash each week to fill a glove compartment. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, to prove that it was no idle boast, Begley -- his brow shiny with 
sweat -- was straining to cram a week's worth of household trash into the tiny 
glove compartment of his battery-powered Volkswagen Rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has got to be the smallest goddamn glove box in the history of man," 
said Begley, who is best known for his television role as a doctor on the 
dramatic series "St. Elsewhere." "This is the one time I wish I owned a Buick 
Le Sabre." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Begley rode his bicycle 13 miles from Studio City to Downtown to 
boast to the supervisors that if everyone in Los Angeles did as he did and 
recycled their yard trimmings and aluminum cans, there would be no need to 
expand the Sunshine Canyon landfill or fill any other pristine canyon with 
garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I throw away one glove compartment's worth of trash every week," Begley said. 
"I know it's doable." 
</P>
<P>
 Sniffed a spokesman for Supervisor Ed Edelman: "Dramatic hyperbole." 
</P>
<P>
 Was Begley's boast fiction or fact? 
</P>
<P>
 The Times went to his Studio City home Wednesday to throw down the gauntlet. 
Given scant warning of the visit, Begley swore he had squirreled away no trash 
to reduce the load. But he had taken the time to slip into a Greenpeace web 
belt, white T-shirt and jeans -- laundered, of course, with non-phosphate 
detergent, one of the many environmentally correct products he uses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It all begins right here," said Begley, pointing to three cardboard cartons 
resting on his wood floor, beneath a desk. He sorts every scrap of paper that 
passes through the door of the one-story, solar-powered ranch house with its 
drought-resistant front lawn, where he lives alone except for frequent visits 
from his two teen-age children and his girlfriend.  
</P>
<P>
 To reduce the flow of junk mail, he personally calls every company that sends 
him a catalogue and asks to be taken off the mailing list. About once a month, 
Begley hops into his $12,000 electric car and putt-putts over to a Sun Valley 
recycler to sell the boxes of separated colored and white paper and 
uncorrugated cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Charging into his kitchen, reporter in pursuit, Begley picked over his kitchen 
trash before emptying it into a larger white bag (made of recycled plastic, 
naturally): a plastic oatmeal cookie wrapper, an empty bag for brown rice. No 
problem there. But what are these objects taking up so much room? Begley 
scowled. 
</P>
<P>
 "My girlfriend was over. I'm not responsible for this milk carton," he said. 
"And my kids had some cream cheese that went bad, that's why this thing is 
here."  
</P>
<P>
 Conspicuously absent from Begley's trash cans were the frozen-food packages 
with their microwaveable trays that many harried Angelenos rely on for 
sustenance -- which cannot be recycled. "I have a microwave," Begley said, "but 
the most I use it for is maybe to heat up a tofu dog. I grow most of my own 
food." 
</P>
<P>
 Then it's out toward the garden, with a quick peek at the yellow bin provided 
by the city for aluminum cans, glass bottles and other recyclable materials. 
"God smiled at me . . . by making me part of one of the city's first recycling 
pilot programs," Begley said, caressing the plastic bin. 
</P>
<P>
 But Begley's real pride and joy is a brown mound of decaying yard trimmings 
and tomato skins that lay just outside his back door. The compost heap produces 
enough soil to replenish the beds of corn, beets and tomatoes that take up 
almost every inch of his spacious yard. 
</P>
<P>
 By this time, Begley had collected enough trash to fill the white plastic bag 
to a depth of about seven bulging inches. He hurried through the garden to the 
garage, where his taupe electric car was recharging with its hood up. On the 
way, he compulsively squeezed the bag to condense the load.

<P>
 Sitting down in the passenger seat, Begley popped open the glove compartment, 
which is the size of a small breadbox. He took a deep breath and, using both 
hands, tried to cram the bag in. It didn't fit.  
</P>
<P>
 But the indefatigable actor had one more trick up his sleeve. Well, actually, 
up his pants. Propping his legs up on the glove compartment, Begley shoved with 
the force of leg muscles that have bicycled over the Sepulveda Pass countless 
times. The bottom of the glove box actually bulged as the bursting bag squeezed 
in, inch by inch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It fits!" Begley shouted triumphantly, slamming shut the glove box before the 
garbage could escape. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't really know if I could do it."  
</P>
<P>
 Begley acknowledges that most city residents would have a hard time recycling 
as much trash as he does. And he knows there's not much environmental benefit 
in driving 20 miles in a gasoline-powered car to discard paper waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics confirm his suspicions. Although 578,000 households in Los Angeles, 
or 80%, now participate in some form of curbside recycling, only half of them 
separate their yard trimmings, which makes up one-third of the city's waste.  
</P>
<P>
 "OK, let them produce four glove compartmentfuls," Begley said. "It would 
still be less than we do now. Then we could begin to close Lopez Canyon and 
other problem landfills." Waste Reduction Tips In addition to utilizing the 
city's curbside recycling program and drop-off centers, residents can take a 
number of measures to reduce waste: Buy recycled products and products with 
least amount of packaging. Make compost for the garden. Buy economy size to 
reduce number of containers thrown away. Use reusable mugs and eating utensils 
instead of plastic and Styrofoam. Buy reusable instead of disposable items, 
such as razors. In Los Angeles, call (800) 773-CITY for ways to reduce waste; 
call (800) 332-SAVE for the recycling center nearest you.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; CITY REGULATORS REMOVE BIRDS FROM HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Animal regulators came to the conclusion that a large, ramshackle house in 
North Hollywood wasn't even for the birds, and so they confiscated several 
hundred peacocks, peahens, pigeons and macaws Thursday that were crammed into 
outdoor cages or running loose through an elderly woman's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal control officers -- it took about 10, in gloves and masks, to remove 
and impound the whole flock -- said in recent days it was unclear if the birds 
had been fed, given water or adequately shielded from the heat. The house, they 
said, is in severe disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
 "The birds are in cages or just running loose in and out of the house," said 
Michael Burns, a district supervisor with the Los Angeles City Department of 
Animal Regulation. "It's a mess. I don't know if there's running water, there 
are piles of rubbish and trash in the house, you can see through portions of 
the ceiling." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns said the bird tale began more than a year ago, when neighbors in the 
7900 block of Atoll Avenue complained about the loud caws of the peacocks.  
</P>
<P>
 Upon inspection, Burns said, regulators determined that many of the roughly 
500 birds were being kept too close to neighboring houses and each other, but 
that there was no inhumane treatment. The house, Burns said, sits on a large 
lot with enough space for the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 After several follow-up inspections, he said, the birds' keeper, Richard Long, 
brought his makeshift sanctuary up to code. 
</P>
<P>
 But several weeks ago, Long ran afoul of the law on another matter, Burns 
said, and left his pets and elderly mother for a stint in jail. By the end of 
last week, inspectors determined that the woman, whom Burns identified as 
Lucille Lockwood, was unable to care for the birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns said he was unsure why Long was keeping the birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have been anything," Burns said. "Sometimes people start a hobby and 
it gets out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
 The birds are being kept at a city facility and at the nonprofit Wildlife 
Waystation in the Angeles National Forest. Burns said officials have not 
determined whether they will file criminal charges. ABIGAIL GOLDMAN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; ANTI-PANHANDLING SIGNS REMOVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leaders of an anti-panhandling effort in Van Nuys have run into difficulty 
with Caltrans workers who are removing their controversial signs from freeway 
off-ramps where panhandlers congregate. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs, which read "Don't Patronize The Vagrants, Don't Be Conned, Help Is 
Available" feature a menacing-looking man with his hand reaching out.They were 
posted on Caltrans signs at the bottom of the San Diego Freeway off-ramps at 
Nordhoff Street and Roscoe Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 But after being put up last month by members of the Sepulveda Boulevard 
Business Watch, the signs were torn down by Caltrans workers last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure this is something Caltrans can assist us with to discourage the 
panhandlers' activity," Flip Smith, president of the Sepulveda Boulevard 
Business Watch said Thursday. "The panhandlers are dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he is concerned that panhandlers tie up traffic at the off-ramps 
and contribute to a negative perception of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vincent Moreno, a Caltrans spokesman, said state law prohibits non-traffic 
signs from being posted on state right of way areas. He also was unable to say 
whether Caltrans would respond to a plea of cooperation from Smith's group. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort was the latest by Smith's group to rid the off-ramps of 
panhandlers. In January, the group proposed using the panhandling design on the 
signs on a leaflet to be distributed by police. That idea was struck down after 
city officials deemed the flyer insensitive to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, no other solution has materialized, frustrating those such as 
Officer Henry Acosta of the LAPD's Devonshire Division, who supported the 
leaflet proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "At all the community meetings I go to, people always bring up the guys down 
at the off-ramps aggressively panhandling, and they wonder why we can't do 
something about it," Acosta said. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; RESIDENTS WANT VOICE IN STREET WIDENING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Leaders of the Studio City Residents Assn. have expressed concerns that they 
were not consulted on a proposal to widen Lankershim Boulevard between Ventura 
and Cahuenga boulevards. The widening could mean the removal of mature trees in 
the median of Lankershim Boulevard, according to association President Tony 
Lucente and board member Patty Kirby. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucente said he has heard that the proposal is being discussed by the Los 
Angeles Department of Transportation, MCA Inc. and the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel strongly that we deserve a right to influence any decision affecting 
this area," Lucente wrote in a letter Wednesday to Robert Yates, general 
manager of the transportation department.  
</P>
<P>
 "(Association) members who live near this site have expressed their concerns 
regarding mitigation measures which might be undertaken without our knowledge," 
the letter reads. "Please confirm the details of traffic mitigation measures on 
Lankershim Boulevard, including the impact on the mature trees currently in the 
median."  
</P>
<P>
 The widening is intended to accommodate increased traffic expected by the 
planned Metro Rail station in Universal City, Lucente said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby said that removing the median and the trees would give the area a "hard 
commercial appearance" and could reduce safety for pedestrians crossing the 
street. Acknowledging that traffic is congested in the area, Kirby said she 
nonetheless believes that the residents association should be allowed to have 
input into the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Yates said Thursday that he had not received Lucente's letter and that 
although he was aware of the widening project he knew few details about it. 
Yates referred questions to transit chief James Okasaki, who could not be 
reached Thursday afternoon. KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; TRUCK JACKKNIFES ACROSS FREEWAY LANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A tractor-trailer heading north on the Golden State Freeway jackknifed 
Thursday morning when an out-of-control car ran into it, forcing the big rig 
over the concrete center divider with its trailer sprawled across the remaining 
lanes of traffic, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no injuries in the accident, which began when Chun Yung of Los 
Angeles had problems with a tire shortly after 9 a.m. while driving in the fast 
lane.Yung lost control of his car and careened into the path of the truck, said 
Officer Mark Garrett of the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck's driver, Jesus Zepeda of Irwindale, in the third lane of the 
four-lane freeway, tried to avoid the car but then ran over its right front 
hood and dragged the passenger vehicle along as it swerved onto the south-bound 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 The tractor spilled about 20 gallons of its own diesel fuel onto the roadway, 
complicating efforts to clear the accident and move morning traffic along, 
Garrett said. All lanes were reopened at 11:43 a.m., he said. ABIGAIL GOLDMAN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; RESIDENTS UPSET BY THE LOSS OF 9 TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Local residents are mourning the loss of nine stately trees along Dickens 
Street just west of Cedros Avenue that were cut down to allow the street to be 
widened. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer of a senior housing project at the corner of Dickens and Cedros, 
the Menorah Housing Federation, was required by the city to widen the street as 
a condition of project approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were opposed to it," said Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks 
Homeowners Assn. "The Department of Transportation doesn't care about trees and 
the aesthetics of a community -- they just care about getting cars through the 
area." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame that they removed the trees," said Jeff Brain, chairman of the 
Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan Review Board. "The trees added character to the 
street." 
</P>
<P>
 The trees, a carob and eight silk-oaks ranging in height from 25 to 52 feet, 
were cut down Monday. Although the tree removal generated shock and dismay in 
some quarters, community leaders had known for some time what the city had in 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighborhood group that targeted the project might have gotten better 
results if it had lobbied for a more sensitive development rather than no 
project at all, Close suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Department of Public Works recommended Dickens Street be widened so 
that moving cars could pass parked cars more safely, and to accommodate the 
additional traffic that the housing project was anticipated to generate, said 
Roger Ketterer, a civil engineer with the department's Bureau of Engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickens Street is a designated collector street, meaning that it connects 
local streets to major roadways, but it is narrower than the standard width of 
a collector street, 44 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Robert Takasaki, senior transportation engineer with the 
transportation department, city policy requires that when a proposed 
development is located on a collector street, the builder must bring the street 
up to the standard width, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Katz, a housing consultant for Menorah, said the development will 
replace the trees by next spring or earlier with 10 four-foot-box-size sycamore 
trees -- meaning the bases of the trees are potted in four-foot-square boxes.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; YOUNG AUTHORS MEET TO SHARE THEIR WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To share their Lilliputian literary feats, more than 200 children in the 
Summer Academic Program for Elementary School Students at Cal State Northridge 
gathered for an outdoor writers convention to read from the books, reports and 
articles they had written. 
</P>
<P>
 The young writers composed their works in the creative writing, report writing 
and journalism classes at CSUN, and read and discussed them at the Young 
Authors Fair on Thursday as a culmination to the summer program. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the fair is to get youngsters in grades one through six to take 
pride in their accomplishments, said Arlinda Eaton, director of the summer 
program, who has found that the children involved come to consider themselves 
published authors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the books have their picture on the back with a blurb that says, 
'This is Matthew's third book. . . ,' " Eaton said with a chuckle. She has 
found that the students are very enthusiastic about sharing their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "They read to the group, show them the illustrations and the group talks about 
the book, asking questions like 'What made you think of that?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The fictional pieces range from that of 7-year-old Colette Yee of Northridge, 
whose pop-up book "Susan's Walk" shows a little girl's walk over mountains and 
under bridges, to Granada Hills resident Denny Wu's gruesome action-adventure 
novella "The Ninjas," in which the bad guys have their noses sliced off, get 
chopped up into little pieces and have their houses blown up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like karate because I like blood," said Denny, looking forward to a career 
as a kung fu novelist. 
</P>
<P>
 Future journalist Nicole Diamond, 10, of Northridge said she enjoys writing 
profiles such as the one she did about one of the summer program's teachers, 
Cindy Bean. Nicole reported: "It's a lot of fun to get to interview people and 
find out more about them." 
</P>
<P>
 Journalism instructor Linda Marsh, who led one of the discussion groups at the 
fair, said: "They are all very good writers and they learn to develop their 
language arts skills." MAKI BECKER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: LAWYER APOLOGIZES TO COURT OVER PROFANITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If he had it to do all over again, Encino defense attorney Alex Kessel says 
he'd call prosecutor Renee Urman a "lowlife" in need of diet pills, but he'd 
leave out the four-letter words. 
</P>
<P>
 Kessel escaped being held in contempt of court Thursday when he apologized to 
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Kathryne Ann Stoltz for using profane language in 
her courtroom. He apologized to the court staff, saying he didn't mean to 
offend them. 
</P>
<P>
 To Urman, however, Kessel offered no apology. "I looked her in the eye and I 
told her how I felt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltz had summoned Kessel to argue why he should not be held in contempt for 
calling the prosecutor a name that included two separate vulgar words, and 
saying she "needs (expletive deleted) diet pills." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge and jury did not hear Kessel's language during a trial earlier this 
month, but Urman and the court staff did. 
</P>
<P>
 After accepting Kessel's apology and promise that he would not use foul 
language in her courtroom again, Stoltz dropped the matter. She did observe 
that Kessel's mea culpa "was a little belated." 
</P>
<P>
 Kessel argued that he was just exercising his constitutional right to express 
his feelings to Urman, who "has a way of provoking people. That woman can be 
quite calculating." 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, he's "always been a gentleman" in court, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Urman "fired the first shot," Kessel said -- telling him to take a 
tranquilizer after he protested because she had a defense witness arrested in 
the hallway on an outstanding traffic violation.  
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, he said, she rolled her eyes when he cross-examined 
witnesses, said things under her breath and otherwise acted as badly as he did 
-- except she didn't use profanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltz said, however, that Kessel, "aware of (Urman's) reputation" around the 
courthouse, came 'looking to deal a little street justice" and "beat her up 
psychologically during the course of the trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Urman did not attend the contempt hearing and could not be reached. ANN W.

<P>
 A tenant accused of stealing expensive furniture and fixtures from the Encino 
home of former state Sen. Alan Robbins was freed Thursday after posting $30,000 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
 As he left his Encino home for a birthday party Wednesday evening, Ted Titmas 
was arrested and booked on suspicion of grand theft, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 He is scheduled to be arraigned in Van Nuys Municipal Court on Aug. 24, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Herbert R. Lapin said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police and court records, Robbins leased his home to Titmas while 
he was serving a federal prison sentence for racketeering and tax evasion. The 
lease for the house on Oak View Drive included a purchase option. 
</P>
<P>
 But Titmas fell behind on his payments and eventually filed for bankruptcy. 
After being evicted, he told Robbins the furniture had been placed in storage 
for safekeeping, and that some of it was auctioned by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon his release from prison, Robbins discovered that the house had been 
stripped bare. He reported $92,000 worth of furniture and fixtures missing, 
including desks, a hand-carved dining table and 10 chairs, expensive Persian 
and Chinese rugs, a Senate desk, antique fixtures, a chandelier, designer 
toilets and a bidet, two bathtubs and sinks, 10 doors and seven sets of drapes.

MAN ROBS BANK OF BUNDLES OF $20S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A robber made off with "several bundles of $20 bills" Thursday from an 
American Savings Bank branch, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 A man entered the bank in the 23000 block of Lyons Avenue and told a teller, 
"Give me the money or you're dead," said Sgt. Rick Doan of the Santa Clarita 
Valley Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Doan said the robber -- a white man in his late 20s, 6 feet tall, weighing 175 
pounds with reddish-brown hair and mustache -- held his hands in such a way as 
to suggest that he had a weapon, but none was seen. 
</P>
<P>
 The man left the bank on foot, ran across Lyons Avenue and headed north into a 
residential area. Sheriff's deputies, working with three police dogs and a 
helicopter, were unable to track him. 
</P>
<P>
 Doan said the exact amount of money taken had not been determined.

METROLINK TRAIN STRIKES, KILLS WOMAN; FATALITY: VICTIM, WHO WAS HOLDING A

<P>
 A Metrolink train Thursday struck and killed a woman who walked onto the 
tracks with a Bible in what police said appeared to be a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 About half the 18 pedestrians killed by Metrolink trains since service began 
in October, 1992, have been classified as suicides. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the woman, believed to be a transient in her mid-30s, was 
sitting on a rock alongside the tracks near San Fernando Road and Sheldon 
Street, reading a Bible, when the No. 216 train approached about 2:50 p.m., 
bound from Santa Clarita to downtown Los Angeles, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the best we can make out, the engineer sounded his horn several times," 
Los Angeles Police Sgt. Monte Houze said. "She decided to cross the tracks as 
the train was going by." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Deputy Joseph Marko said the train, traveling about 80 m.p.h., 
carried the woman's body more than 100 yards, depositing it alongside the 
tracks before coming to a stop about three-quarters of a mile from the point of 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The train, which was due in Los Angeles at 3:16 p.m., was delayed about two 
hours. None of the 25 passengers were injured, Houze said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours after the incident, pages of the Bible the woman carried fluttered about 
the track and the white sheets covering the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the beginning of the year, five people have been killed by Metrolink 
trains, about half of them suicides, said Bill Currier, Metrolink's director of 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have all kinds of reasons, I suppose," Currier said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate incident Thursday, a homeless man sleeping by the side of tracks 
near the Santa Susana Pass tunnel was hit by a freight train, which severed his 
foot. Kevin Asunction was able to crawl to a nearby building and was taken to 
Simi Valley Hospital, where he was in stable condition, a hospital spokeswoman 
said.

LANDFILL EXPANSION CLEARS HURDLE; ENVIRONMENT: JUDGE WILL LIFT ORDER BARRING 
BROWNING-FERRIS FROM DOING ANY WORK AT SUNSHINE CANYON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A judge Thursday cleared the way for expansion of Sunshine Canyon Landfill to 
resume in a wooded canyon north of Granada Hills, dealing nearby residents 
another setback in their efforts to stop the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne said that within 10 days, she 
will lift a restraining order barring dump operator Browning-Ferris Industries 
Inc. from felling any trees or doing any work in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents vowed to appeal the ruling, an action that could extend the stay 
another 20 days. In the meantime, the Los Angeles City Council will meet today 
to discuss dropping its objections to the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Browning-Ferris was given permission in December by the Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors to expand the now-idle landfill's capacity by 17 million 
tons. When crews started ripping out trees in June, opponents sued. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne ruled Thursday that the lawsuit filed by the North Valley Coalition of 
Concerned Citizens failed to raise any new issues. Over the past three years, 
the coalition has attacked the dump project on numerous legal fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a total and complete victory for us," Browning-Ferris spokesman Arnie 
Berghoff said. "The judge showed that this case had no merits and that it was 
just one in a series of delaying tactics by the North Valley Coalition." 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition attorney Rosemary Woodlock disagreed, saying: "BFI certainly is not 
out of the woods yet." In addition to appealing Thursday's decision, the 
coalition has a separate lawsuit on other issues regarding the dump pending in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 In dismissing the coalition's lawsuit, Wayne ruled that Browning-Ferris and 
Los Angeles County had complied with all state laws as the expansion project 
worked its way through the approval process. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than lift the construction ban immediately, however, Wayne allowed 10 
days for the coalition to appeal. In the past, Browning-Ferris crews have begun 
work at the earliest possible opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of a county oversight committee's permission to begin 
construction in June, crews began work. By the end of the weekend, roughly 
1,400 trees were cut down, prompting Wayne to issue her injunction. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the dump was first approved in 1991, the coalition has been joined in 
its legal challenges by the city of Los Angeles, which closed the dump in 1991. 
The expansion will take place on adjacent land just outside the city limits in 
Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 After running up more than $500,000 in legal bills, the City Council is 
considering settling with Browning-Ferris, leaving the coalition to fight the 
dump on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The council will meet in closed session today to discuss a settlement 
proposal. Although the negotiations are secret, documents and interviews reveal 
that Browning-Ferris is offering the city at least $1.5 million in legal fees 
and community improvements to drop its objections. A county condition that city 
trash be excluded from the landfill would also be eliminated. In return, 
Browning-Ferris reportedly wants the council to grant access to the expansion 
along a road through the current dump site. 
</P>
<P>
 But Woodlock threatened that the coalition would turn around and sue its 
former allies if city officials enter into an agreement with Browning-Ferris 
that circumvents the normal city approval process -- such as one that grants 
road access without a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the city is settling the case to avoid legal costs, they need to be 
careful," she said.

PLANNING COMMISSION VOTES TO LEGALIZE HOME-BASED BUSINESSES; ZONING: ADVOCATES 
CRITICIZE SOME RESTRICTIONS IN PROPOSED NEW LAW. HOMEOWNERS WHO OPPOSE PLAN 
FEAR IT WOULD TURN NEIGHBORHOODS INTO COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The city of Los Angeles moved a step closer to allowing businesses to operate 
in residential areas, with a city panel voting unanimously Thursday to legalize 
more than two dozen home-based occupations. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote by the city's Planning Commission came nearly 10 years after 
officials first began to study whether to change zoning codes that prohibit 
commercial operations in residential neighborhoods. Only doctors, dentists and 
ministers were allowed to conduct business in their homes under the current 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the City Council, the proposed ordinance would bring Los 
Angeles in line with dozens of other municipalities in Southern California that 
have legalized home-based business, and have begun to collect city fees on the 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission decision followed more than three hours of public 
testimony from homeowners, most of whom fear the law would turn residential 
neighborhoods into crowded commercial districts. Home business supporters were 
also heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an unfair burden on residential communities that are trying to 
establish a peaceful, restful and quiet atmosphere," said Alan Kishbaugh, 
president of the Federation of Hillside and Canyon Assns., which represents 
about 250,000 residents on both sides of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of home-based businesses testified at the hearing that they are 
happy the city is finally attempting to legalize such enterprises, but they 
criticized many restrictions in the proposed law. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Judy Corbet, who has a temporary permit to operate a 
costume-making business out of her North Hollywood home, challenged a provision 
that allows only 25% of a home's floor space to be used for a commercial 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does it matter how much space is used as long as it doesn't affect the 
neighbors?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning officials acknowledged that when they drafted the proposed law they 
realized it would not completely please both sides. But they urged the 
commission to adopt the proposal and allow them to make adjustments to the law 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our best effort," said Robert JanoviciCQ, the city's chief zoning 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 As written, the ordinance would: 
</P>
<P>
 * Permit 26 occupations in single-family and multifamily neighborhoods, 
including accountants, attorneys, engineers and composers; 
</P>
<P>
 * Charge a home business license fee, ranging from $50 to $150; 
</P>
<P>
 * Prohibit outdoor signs advertising the business; 
</P>
<P>
 * Prohibit hiring employees who do not live in the home; 
</P>
<P>
 * Limit business operations to 25% of the home's floor space; 
</P>
<P>
 * Ban all excessive noise, dust or vibrations caused by the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses that violate the proposed law could be fined or shut down entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning officials said the ordinance requires a public hearing for those 
businesses that do not meet the criteria. Also, the proposed law allows the 
commission and zoning administrators to add or eliminate occupations from the 
list of permitted businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no estimates on the number of home-based businesses now operating 
illegally in the city. But approximately 2,500 residents each year are turned 
down by the city's Building and Safety Department for permits to operate home 
businesses, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 City revenues would have increased by $125,000 to $250,000 annually if each of 
those requests had been permitted and the owners charged a license fee of $50 
to $100. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort to regulate home-based businesses in Los Angeles started in 1985 
when the late City Councilman Howard Finn asked city planning officials to 
draft regulations to allow such enterprises in residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 But twice the Planning Commission has rejected planning staff recommendations, 
sending the proposals back for further study. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Laura Chick, who had asked planning officials to try again, told 
the commission on Thursday that despite some problems with the ordinance, it 
should be approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city must make a statement that they value the home-based businesses," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the vote Debra Schacher, the head of a home-based business association 
in Irvine, said, "We are pleased that we have gotten this far but we should 
have been much further by now." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Murley, president of the Woodland Hills Homeowners Assn., took the 
opposite side, saying, "We feel this is essentially gutting the (residential 
single-family) zone." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ordinance next will be heard by the council's Planning and Land 
Use Committee. No date has yet been scheduled.

BODY BELIEVED TO BE THAT OF MISSING WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A body found Thursday morning in a remote area north of Lancaster is believed 
to be that of Earlene Udagar, 35, who was reported missing this week, Los 
Angeles County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Ron Spear said investigators must await the results of a coroner's 
autopsy but believe that the cause of death was suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's body was found next to a parked car just off Avenue E at the 
Antelope Valley Freeway. Homicide investigators found a medicine vial at the 
scene and traced the car's registration to Udagar, Spear said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, deputies asked for the public's help in locating the 
Lancaster woman, who had not been seen since July 23. The coroner's staff will 
make a final determination on the identity of the body, Spear said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; EX-GIRLFRIEND SAYS MARTIAL ARTIST TOLD UNKNOWN 
SLAYING DETAILS; TRIAL: CHERYL DESMARTEAU ALSO SAYS THE SUSPECT CHANGED HIS 
ALIBI. THE DEFENSE GETS A WITNESS TO SAY HE WAS UNSURE ABOUT SEEING THE ACCUSED 
NEAR THE CRIME SCENE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The ex-girlfriend of a martial arts instructor accused of killing a co-worker 
testified Thursday that the defendant knew details of the incident before 
police and changed his alibi during the weeks after the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Foltz also continued to build his case against 
Stuart Edward Milburn, 27, by presenting two witnesses to the Los Angeles 
Superior Court jury who said they saw Milburn near the murder scene at about 
the time it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 But Milburn's attorney, Darryl Mounger, got one witness to admit he has doubts 
that Milburn is the person he saw the night of the murder. Mounger also pointed 
out that the other witness may be confused about what day she claims to have 
seen Milburn. 
</P>
<P>
 Milburn is accused of killing Veronica Estrada, 29, about 8:15 p.m. Dec. 15, 
1993, as she walked home alone on Soledad Canyon Road in Santa Clarita. He is 
one of the people who found her partly clothed body in bushes alongside the 
road the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have charged that Milburn killed Estrada because he was jealous of 
her accomplishments. She was the American Taekwondo Assn.'s top-ranked female 
competitor in the second-level black belt division and was named instructor of 
the year at Taekwondo USA in Canyon Country where she and Milburn worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Desmarteau, a San Fernando Valley resident, testified that she met 
Milburn in April, 1993, and that they later dated until the end of the year. 
She said he asked her to come to his house the night of the day Estrada's body 
was found, and told her Estrada had been "struck from behind and strangled" 
between 8 and 9 p.m. the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. John Laurie, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department homicide 
detective, testified that he interviewed Milburn briefly several hours after 
Estrada's body was found, but never told Milburn those details because they 
were still unknown to police officials.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Foltz said nor did other investigators tell Milburn about the time 
and cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
 Milburn told her he had left the studio about 8 p.m. the night of the murder, 
Desmarteau said. "He said he was not feeling well, he left the studio and went 
home to sleep," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when Milburn found out in January that he was a suspect, Desmarteau 
said that he then told her he had been at a record store next door to the tae 
kwon do studio where he worked. That statement remains Milburn's alibi at the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Mounger said Milburn's statement about going home the night of the murder was 
intentionally misleading, but for relatively innocent reasons. "He talked to 
some other female (that night)," he said. "He just didn't want to tell her 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Thursday, two motorists testified that they were driving along Soledad 
Canyon Road near the murder scene and saw a man on foot between 8:15 and 8:30 
p.m. Both witnesses later picked Milburn as that man when police showed them a 
photo lineup of six suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Alfonso, a Canyon Country resident, said he saw a man step up on a curb 
between 8:25 and 8:30 p.m. But he told Mounger the man he saw wore different 
glasses from those Milburn wears now and that the man had disheveled blond 
hair. Milburn's is red. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you look at Mr. Milburn today, can you say for sure he is the person you 
saw that night?" Mounger asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No I cannot," Alfonso replied. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alfonso also testified that he is positive Estrada's boyfriend, Eddie 
Hockaday, is not the man he saw.  
</P>
<P>
 Mounger filed a motion Monday stating he will present evidence Hockaday or an 
unknown assailant committed the murder. Judge Charles E. Horan is expected to 
rule after prosecutors file a written response. 
</P>
<P>
 Foltz has dismissed Mounger's motion as "a joke" intended to divert attention 
from Milburn. 
</P>
<P>
 Milburn is in custody without bail. He faces life in prison without the 
possibility of parole if convicted of first-degree murder with special 
circumstances of lying in wait, forcible sodomy and attempted rape.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; WITNESS TESTIFIES IN SLAYING OF BOYS; ANTELOPE 
VALLEY: TWO ACCUSED KILLERS CAME TO HIS HOUSE TO CHANGE CLOTHES AND GET RID OF 
A VAN, LITTLEROCK MAN SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A witness in the trial of two Antelope Valley men accused of stabbing two 
teen-age runaways to death two years ago testified Thursday that the men came 
to his house the morning after the killings to change their clothes and get rid 
of the van they had allegedly stolen from the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution claims that Joseph Tomas Orcasitas, 21, of Littlerock and Jose 
Angel Orona, 23, of Palmdale were part of a burglary ring and that they killed 
David Benjamin Scott, 14, of Llano to prevent him from testifying against them. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The pair also are charged with killing David's companion, Daniel Kufeldt, 15, 
of Palmdale. The boys' bodies were found June 22, 1992, in a remote desert 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron L. Smalstig, the prosecutor, said Orcasitas and Orona 
lured the teen-agers "to a remote area and killed them and left the bodies to 
rot out in the desert." 
</P>
<P>
 Orcasitas and Orona are each charged with two counts of murder with the 
special circumstances of multiple murder, conspiracy, lying in wait, murder 
during a robbery and murder of a witness. They could receive the death penalty 
if they are convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Andres Valdez, 20, of Littlerock, testified Thursday in Los Angeles 
Superior Court that he heard the door to his house open about 2 a.m. and that 
when he knocked on his bathroom door, he "saw Joe and Casper wearing towels 
around their waists." 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez told the court it was normal for Antelope Valley youths to stay at his 
house for drug parties while his mother was working. It was no different the 
morning after the killings, Valdez said, except that Orcasitas and Orona 
returned with the van David had stolen from his own family days earlier, and 
David did not return with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They asked me to get rid of the van, and I said no," Valdez said. "The only 
thing I can remember is telling them that I didn't think what they were doing 
was right." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys for both men contend that the prosecution lacks credible 
witnesses and that prosecution witnesses are exchanging their testimony for 
leniency.  
</P>
<P>
 Valdez was questioned by Deputy Public Defender Alan Budde, Orcasitas' 
attorney, about his numerous suicide attempts and years of drug use. 
</P>
<P>
 After Valdez described a menu of drugs he was using on a regular basis at the 
time, including heroin, cocaine, speed and alcohol, Budde asked, "Was that a 
typical day of drugs you ingested?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Valdez answered. "I'd say I was incoherent." 
</P>
<P>
 On May 29, 1992, Orona attended a party at Valdez's house where he told 
Durwood (Billy) Bland III, a key witness for the prosecution, that David had 
stolen his ring, according to a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department report. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to court documents, a friend, Brian Peak, drove Orona, Orcasitas and 
Bland to a campground near Big Rock Creek in Angeles National Forest where the 
two youths were camped. Peak was freed from jail after pleading no contest to 
being an accessory to the boys' killings. 
</P>
<P>
 Bland drove the boys to 96th Street East and Avenue V, and lured them out of 
the van, authorities said. Orona demanded the ring from David, according to a 
sheriff's report, but David told them he didn't have it. Orona then started 
stabbing David, the report says.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; BABY GETS NEW HEART AT UCLA; HEALTH: DAVID 
PATT, BORN WITH AN UNDERDEVELOPED VENTRICLE, UNDERGOES A SUCCESSFUL TRANSPLANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 A rare heart transplant performed for the first time at UCLA Medical Center 
has given the infant son of a Santa Clarita couple a new chance at life. 
</P>
<P>
 David Henry Patt, son of Roy and Sarah Patt, was born July 19 with an 
underdeveloped left heart ventricle. He was 16 days old Wednesday when doctors 
successfully replaced his heart with that of a 4-day-old infant. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite having the largest heart transplant program in the country, the 
early-morning operation was the first time doctors at UCLA have performed a 
neonatal heart transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are just a few centers in the country that do neonatal transplants, so 
it's still very rare," said Dr. Hillel Laks, the medical center's chief of 
cardiac surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby's parents said in an interview that they are thankful not only for 
the doctors who performed the four-hour operation, but also for the anonymous, 
out-of-state family that agreed to donate the heart of their newborn infant, 
who had died. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel grateful that someone was able to give the gift of life during their 
time of tragedy," said Sarah Patt, 27. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somewhere along the line, somebody lost a baby," said Roy Patt, 36. "It would 
be very difficult to let somebody take your precious, newborn baby, even when 
you know it's for a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Patts said they have been fortunate throughout their experience, from when 
they first learned of David's heart defect by accident, to this week when the 
donated heart became available -- one day before doctors were prepared to 
proceed with a riskier surgery instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patts first discovered the baby's heart defect when Sarah Patt, a 
fifth-grade teacher at Sulphur Springs Elementary School, went to UCLA Medical 
Center for a belated ultrasound examination during the 26th week of her 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things were so strange that we found out at all," said Roy Patt, who works as 
a printing broker. "We probably wouldn't be here at all if it weren't for a 
series of flukes that put us in a better position than most people (of 
knowing)." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Patt's doctors had three choices -- abort the baby, proceed with a 
surgery to reconstruct the heart's aorta to link it solely to the right 
ventricle or wait for a donated heart for a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the survival rate is three times higher for a transplant patient -- 
near 90% -- it can only be attempted when a donated heart becomes available. 
After two difficult weeks, the Patts received word of a possible donor from 
outside California -- one day before doctors planned to go ahead with the other 
less successful procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was almost like a fantasy fairy tale type of thing," said Sarah Patt. "I'm 
still trying to absorb it." 
</P>
<P>
 Barring a rejection of the new heart, doctors expect David to live a normal 
life. The only accommodation that must be made to his transplanted heart will 
be a regular injection of immuno-suppressant drugs.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; VALENCIA NATIONAL BANK NAMES PRESIDENT;

 A Los Angeles man with a 24-year career in banking and business operations was 
named president of Valencia National Bank on Thursday, replacing the founding 
president, who was ousted June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 John M. Reardon, an executive officer for The Ram Cos., is scheduled to take 
over the post Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ram Cos., based in Oklahoma, is a conglomerate of firms that include 
manufacturing and financial operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Reardon has previously served as president and chief operating officer of 
Oklahoma-based Southwestern Bank & Trust Co., a bank similar in size to 
Valencia National Bank, officials said. Reardon also is a onetime senior vice 
president of Wells Fargo Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "John Reardon is bringing to our bank the kind of banking, marketing and 
business experience we need at this time," Lou Garasi, chairman of the bank's 
board of directors, said in a prepared statement. "His previous success in 
these areas make him a good match for our bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we will now be able to serve Santa Clarita Valley consumers and 
businesses even better than we have in the past," Garasi added. 
</P>
<P>
 Reardon, who is in his early 50s, holds a bachelor's degree in marketing from 
Oklahoma State University and an advanced degree from Southern Methodist 
University's Southwestern Graduate School of Banking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Banking is a fascinating industry, but is going through considerable change 
now, requiring unique talents," Reardon said. "My business experience helps me 
better understand and serve the banking needs of our business customers, 
because I've been in their position." 
</P>
<P>
 Reardon takes over the post previously held by Robert Manley, who was fired by 
bank directors June 1 after he refused to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Directors cited declining earnings at the bank and said Manley was 
unresponsive to shareholders and customers. Manley insists that he was ousted 
for trying to collect unpaid loans -- including several owed by bank directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Manley, who has since been named regional vice president of American Pacific 
State Bank's Valencia branch slated to open later this month, filed a 
$2-million lawsuit in July against Valencia National Bank directors over his 
termination.

PLAYERS STAND BY AUG. 12; BASEBALL: ANGER OVER OWNERS' FAILED PENSION PAYMENT 
WON'T LEAD TO EARLIER STRIKE DATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Although angered by club owners' refusal to make a $7.8-million pension 
payment from All-Star game receipts, major league player representatives agreed 
with the recommendation of their union leaders Thursday to retain their strike 
deadline of Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because the owners have behaved in a highly irresponsible and 
provocative manner, perhaps intentionally, doesn't mean the players have to," 
Don Fehr, the union's executive director, said after a conference call with 
player representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was considerable sentiment for an earlier (strike) date, perhaps as 
soon as tomorrow, but the goal is to negotiate a new (bargaining) agreement, 
and we still feel that Aug. 12 best maximizes that possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Fehr said, he "doesn't want anybody to think the issue (of 
the pension payment) will go away or be compromised. There will not be an 
agreement without the payment and interest on it. We will continue to pursue 
legal remedies and make a choice (from among the options) within a few days." 
</P>
<P>
 The players insist that they would not have played the All-Star game if they 
had known the owners were going to withhold the payment due on Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief negotiator, said again Thursday that there 
was no obligation to make that payment because the pension provisions in the 
bargaining agreement expired on March 19. "I understand the players may be 
sorry we didn't make a payment we weren't obligated to make," Ravitch said, 
seeming to shrug off the depth of the players' anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased this tempest in a teapot has passed and we're back to the 
bargaining table to talk about the real issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the two sides met in work groups Thursday afternoon and will 
meet again this morning. There has been virtually no negotiation on the main 
issue of salary cap vs. status quo, but union counsel Lauren Rich said she 
wouldn't dismiss the significance of the work groups. As long as there is 
dialogue, she said, there is hope. 
</P>
<P>
 The player representatives had to be convinced of that. Fehr said that about 
10 teams had taken straw polls and favored an earlier date. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the feeling was, "Why are the owners doing this, what are they trying 
to accomplish, unless it's to force a strike as soon as possible? What (the 
owners) did flies in the face of any desire management might express about 
reaching an agreement. But we've learned a hard lesson through the years and it 
still resonates. We have to make our own decisions and do what we have to do 
when we feel it's appropriate. A strike is a last resort. We're not going to 
exercise that option until we have no other choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr contends that a strike is the union's only leverage. He fears that the 
owners will ultimately declare an impasse and unilaterally implement a 
salary-cap system. He said Thursday that it appears unlikely baseball can avoid 
its eighth work stoppage in 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr's pessimism didn't prevent the union from proposing a plan by which the 
clubs would increase their revenue sharing to aid the small markets without 
tying it to a salary cap. Sources said the plan is based on sharing all 
broadcast revenue -- local as well as national -- but it is expected to be 
rejected by big-market clubs, which agreed to Ravitch's increased formula only 
if it was tied to a cap by which the players, as the union contends, pays them 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr indicated that he would release details of his proposal after it has been 
fully presented to the owners, probably today.

MIKE DOWNEY: BUTLER'S PERSISTENT HERE, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brett Butler -- center fielder, labor leader -- came to work Thursday morning 
in shirt and tie, carrying his suit coat. He looked as purposeful as Jimmy 
Hoffa in a plant full of truck drivers. High noon was approaching, and he and 
his fellow union organizers did not intend to blink.  
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to push our hot button, trying to get us to go out," Butler, 
the player representative of the Dodgers, said emphatically after spreading the 
word to his colleagues that their strike date would remain Aug. 12, as 
scheduled, and not be nudged forward in response to management's withholding of 
pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler took a conference call with the union's executive director, Donald 
Fehr, then strode into an anteroom behind the Dodger clubhouse with pitcher 
Orel Hershiser in lockstep, tagging along for moral support.  
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing surprises me . . . what the owners do. We have to look at the 
under-mindedness (sic) of this," Butler said flatly, revealing neither anger 
nor relief.  
</P>
<P>
 "What was the real reason for them doing this? Was it to cause us to strike? 
Because you're sitting here thinking, and fans are sitting there thinking, 'The 
players are striking.' And, you know, 'It's the players' fault.' Well, we're 
here to tell you that the owners tried to push us out." 
</P>
<P>
 But the union stood firm.  
</P>
<P>
 Butler set his square jaw. He said with conviction: "We're as strong a union 
as you're going to find in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a beautiful day for baseball, and the Dodgers and San Diego Padres 
stayed and played. They waited for their marching orders until a little past 11 
a.m., when Fehr confirmed that despite what he described as an "irresponsible 
and provocative" attempt by the owners to hasten a walkout, America's 
ballplaying union would not be double-dared into the picket lines. Around the 
home team's clubhouse, gallows humor abounded. Dodger third baseman Tim Wallach 
wore a shirt that read: "Shut Up and Play." On a chalkboard where a clubhouse 
attendant had written the words, PACK YOUR BAGS AND BATS, so as to notify the 
players that their scheduled trip would proceed as usual, someone else had 
scribbled a joking addendum: SEE YOU NEXT SPRING.  
</P>
<P>
 In the manager's office, Tom Lasorda watched Fehr's pronouncement on cable TV. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "Who was it that said the only thing we have to fear is Fehr himself?" Lasorda 
asked. "Good line." 
</P>
<P>
 His first-place team could be on strike one week from today, perhaps never to 
return to Dodger Stadium until 1995.  
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda listened intently as Fehr said, "It keeps coming back to a basic 
question. Why in the world are the owners doing this? What do they hope to 
accomplish? I don't really have an answer to that, unless it is to force a 
strike as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda snickered. He said, "Why don't the owners just hand over the money to 
guys threatening to go on strike? There's a funny question. Why do you think ?" 
</P>
<P>
 Outdoors near the batting cage, Dodger outfielder Cory Snyder said it was 
understandable why the players were upset.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking now about money (that was) supposed to go to the pension and 
welfare fund," Snyder said. "This is money for people who already did their 
work, people who are counting on that money." 
</P>
<P>
 By noon, busloads of children from 136 day camps throughout California began 
to fill the stands. It is summertime and baseball business as usual. Young 
pitchers Doug Brocail, Bryce Florie and Jeff Tabaka of the Padres signed 
autographs by the bunches. Shagging flies, Billy Bean flipped baseballs into 
the right-field stands while Trevor Hoffman entertained fans by collapsing into 
a heap after being struck by a fungo-batted baseball, pretending to be mortally 
wounded.  
</P>
<P>
 The players are trying to keep spirits up, including their own.  
</P>
<P>
 But Butler knows their strike has merely been averted, not aborted. It won't 
be over until the fatcats sing. It won't be over until management and labor can 
come to some form of mutual consent, until players whose indignation ranged 
"from one extreme to the other" over the past 48 hours can somehow compromise 
enough to call this walkout to a halt.  
</P>
<P>
 Butler never wanted to be in this position. He only wanted to be in center 
field.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodger player rep did most of the talking, Hershiser sticking close but 
mainly back-patting.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm managing," Hershiser said.  
</P>
<P>
 Passing by Butler's locker, Bill Russell, a Dodger coach, tried to ease some 
of the stress Butler was clearly under.  
</P>
<P>
 "Brett Fehr!" Russell called him. "Brett Fehr!" 
</P>
<P>
 Butler smiled, wanly.  
</P>
<P>
 He returned to the serious matter at hand and said: "Peter O'Malley pays us a 
sum of money, a great sum of money, to perform, and we intend to live up to 
those obligations like nothing else has happened. In a good-faith negotiation, 
we can still have this thing done by the 12th.  
</P>
<P>
 "But there's one thing that is clear -- the players are unified." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley, owner of the Dodgers, was not present on what could have been the 
team's final day. He was in Managua, Nicaragua, attending an amateur baseball 
tournament.  
</P>
<P>
 One week from today, amateur baseball could be all there is. That and minor 
league ball. But no minor leaguers would have the nerve to play in their place, 
of this the major leaguers are sure. Brett Butler, labor leader, will tolerate 
no scabs.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was in the minor leagues in 1981, and they asked me in Richmond, Virginia, 
would I go to the big leagues to take the place of the players that were (not) 
there. And my comment then was, 'They're there to help me.' Now I'm on the 
other side of the fence and I'm 37 years old and on the latter part of my 
career. And the fact of the matter is, they tried to break us then and they're 
trying to break us now.  
</P>
<P>
 "They won't."

CBS BAGS TWO MAJOR BOWL GAMES IN NEW SETUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the announcement Thursday of a new bowl alliance, college football took a 
step toward eliminating the logjam of bowl games on New Year's Day, and CBS 
showed it is still a major player in the sports television business. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning after the 1995 season, the Orange, Fiesta and Sugar bowls will 
alternate each year as the site of a matchup of the top two teams available to 
the alliance, which hopefully would be the top two teams in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The games will be played in prime time on Dec. 31, Jan. 1 and Jan. 2. CBS will 
televise the Orange and Fiesta bowls, ABC the Sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is part of our plan to be a major player and restore our involvement in 
sports programming to the highest level," said David Kenin, president of CBS 
Sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with the 1996 season, CBS will carry Big East and Southeastern 
Conference games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Atlantic Coast Conference, the Big East, the SEC and the Big 12 (formerly 
the Big Eight) are involved in the new alliance. The Southwest Conference will 
be involved only for the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific 10 and the Big Ten will remain affiliated with the Rose Bowl, 
which could offer a national championship game only if the nation's two top 
teams came from those conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, we look at this as a positive," said Jim Muldoon, Pac-10 director of 
communications. "It means it is unlikely that the Rose Bowl will host a 
national championship game, but it could also mean that the Rose Bowl will be 
televised unopposed by another bowl game, and that's a plus." 
</P>
<P>
 The big loser is the Cotton Bowl, which had bid to become what is being called 
a Tier 1 bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen better days," Cotton Bowl executive John Scovell said. But he 
added: "The sun is still shining on the Cotton Bowl. The three bowls plus the 
Rose Bowl will eliminate only eight teams." 
</P>
<P>
 To get Tier 1 designations, the Fiesta Bowl reportedly bid $118 million, the 
Orange Bowl $104 million and the Sugar Bowl $98 million. The money comes from 
sponsorship and television contracts. The average payout per team will be $8.5 
million.

HRBEK SAYS HIS TIME HAS COME; BASEBALL: TWINS' FIRST BASEMAN ANNOUNCES 
RETIREMENT EFFECTIVE AT THE END OF THIS SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kent Hrbek grew up near old Met Stadium and, he says, bleeds Minnesota Twins 
red, white and blue. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer able to wear his uniform proudly, the big first baseman announced 
Thursday that he will retire at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I can still hit. The problem is getting there after I hit it," said 
Hrbek, who has battled several injuries the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hitting the ball off the wall and not being able to make it to second base, I 
don't like that. And I can't play first base like I used to. It's not that I 
really wanted to (retire), but I think I had to. I wasn't doing the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the game. I love the people. It's just time for Kent to sit down and 
take on some other loves in the game of life -- fishing, hunting, family 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Hrbek, 34, has spent his entire career in the Twins organization. He is the 
only member of the current team to have worn a Minnesota uniform at the old 
Met, and he and Kirby Puckett are the only ones left from the 1987 World Series 
championship team. 
</P>
<P>
 "My house is painted red, white and blue. I'm going to bleed Twins colors," he 
said. "I'm a Twins fan, I've always been a Twins fan and I will continue being 
a Twins fan forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Hrbek, who ranks in the Twins' top five in almost every offensive category, is 
the second former All-Star to retire this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago's Ryne Sandberg, perhaps the era's best second baseman, didn't wait 
until the end of the season to retire. He left the Cubs in May, walking away 
from about $15 million because he said the game was no longer fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Hrbek is not a probable Hall of Famer like Sandberg but has been one of 
baseball's best first basemen during a 13-year career. He's in the final season 
of a five-year, $14 million contract and says he's still having fun. But he 
simply doesn't feel he has played well the last couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hrbek originally had planned to announce his retirement in September. But with 
a strike threatening to end the season next week, Hrbek moved up his 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was wondering if we were even going to show up here today, the way they 
were talking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The union, angry about management's decision not to make the Aug. 1 payment to 
the players' pension plan, considered walking immediately but instead decided 
to keep the Aug. 12 strike date. 
</P>
<P>
 Hrbek would be happy if the strike never happens because playing baseball for 
the Twins is the one thing he loves most. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of fun. It's a great atmosphere in the Twins' clubhouse," he 
said. "It's kind of like sitting by a campfire, talking about that big fish 
that got away. All the talking and stuff is probably the part of the game I'll 
miss the most. 
</P>
<P>
 "There ain't nothing wrong with hitting a home run and jogging around the 
bases, either. I enjoy that, also." 
</P>
<P>
 Hrbek has 291 home runs, second in club history to Harmon Killebrew's 475. 
This season, Hrbek's worst, he has only eight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to a good friend of mine, Gary Gaetti," Hrbek said, referring to his 
one-time teammate and best friend who now plays for Kansas City. "He saw me 
round first base the other day when I hit a double in Kansas City. He said, 'It 
looks like you should retire,' the way I was running the bases." 
</P>
<P>
 Hrbek went from Class A ball to the Twins on Aug. 24, 1981, and started that 
day at New York. He beat the Yankees with a 12th-inning home run and has 
anchored the Twins' infield ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a career batting average of .282, with 1,076 RBIs, 1,741 hits, 900 runs 
and 2,961 total bases. He holds the major-league record with 164 home runs in 
domed ballparks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not really a big man on records," Hrbek said. He then held up his right 
hand, where he wore his 1991 World Series championship ring. "I've got one of 
these on my finger and I've got one sitting at home. I guess that was the 
goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Tom Kelly will miss Hrbek's hitting, fielding and have-fun attitude. 
Mostly, he'll miss the way Hrbek's big left-handed bat disrupts an opponent's 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the opposing manager doesn't want to face him," Kelly said. "He causes 
confusion to the other manager and to the bullpen." 
</P>
<P>
 Puckett was saddened that Hrbek's career is ending but was happy that Hrbek is 
going out on his own terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "He lives in the Land of 10,000 Lakes and he wants to fish in all 10,000 of 
them," Puckett said. "I can't blame him." 
</P>
<P>
 Hrbek, who was offered $1.5 million more to play for Detroit five years ago 
but decided to stay in Minnesota, said he'll always be a Twin. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll see me in the stands cheering the Twins on," he said, "as long as I 
can make it up and down the stairs."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; MUST NOT HAVE BEEN CAMERA DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The day after Reggie Smith was ejected from Wednesday night's game by home 
plate umpire Larry Poncino, the Dodger coach was still steaming. So was crew 
chief Bruce Froemming. 
</P>
<P>
 Froemming said Smith was ejected in the Padre half of the seventh inning 
because he "flaunted" a photograph of a called third strike at Poncino, then 
waved his hands in disgust. Smith said he didn't do any of that. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he was upset initially because Raul Mondesi, in the bottom of the 
sixth inning, had taken a called third strike. He thought the pitch might have 
been too close for Mondesi to take. So he went into the video room and made a 
still picture of the pitch, taken from a camera on top of the stadium.  
</P>
<P>
 "I walked out with it and said to (the players), 'You guys are not going to 
believe this, I'm sick of this,' " Smith said, referring to the called third 
strike, not Mondesi's decision not to swing. "And Poncino said, 'That's it, 
you're gone.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Froemming, though, said Smith has made still photos of calls several times 
this season. He said the umpires were aware of Smith's tactic after Tuesday's 
game, when players mentioned to him that they had seen pictures of a few 
questionable calls.  
</P>
<P>
 "If they want that for their review, fine, and they want to look at it and 
say, 'Hey he missed it' or whatever, fine, that's their review," Froemming 
said. "We're not perfect, but we are not going to be intimidated by some stupid 
camera that sits at an elevation of 300 feet above a ballpark. If they can call 
pitches from there, then that's where they can put the umpire, up there, and 
you would have a nice evening." MARYANN HUDSON

SURFING; GILL, ON HER OWN TERMS, TOPS MENCZER

 Tricia Gill left the women's surfing tour six years ago because it was wearing 
on her. She still wanted to surf, but not on demand -- competition would be her 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Gill, 28, chose to compete in both the Op Pro and the U.S. Open of 
Surfing. Without the pressure of world standings and constant touring, she has 
shined in the two contests at Huntington Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second round of the U.S. Open's main event, Gill beat 1993 world 
champion Pauline Menczer. At her mother's coaching, Gill caught a wave with the 
opening buzzer, instead of waiting for the best waves in the 3- to 5-foot surf. 
 
</P>
<P>
 With four minutes to go in the 25-minute heat, Menczer needed a 7.9 to move 
into first place. Gill, of Carlsbad, paddled around the priority buoy to keep 
Menczer from catching the wave she needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're friends, so I feel bad," Gill said of her maneuver that spelled the end 
for Menczer. "When I was on the tour, I never even used the priority buoy." 
</P>
<P>
 Gill will face Kylie Webb of Australia in the quarterfinals today at 2:20 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In men's surfing, all four wild cards advanced to the third round. Surfing in 
better conditions at 6 a.m., former world champion Tom Curren had the best wave 
selection, catching three barrel rides from only four waves. He scored a 9.17, 
the highest score of the day. One judge gave him a perfect 10. JODY BERGER

POSTCARD / ST. PETERSBURG; HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS FOR RUSSIA'S TAMARA 
MOSKVINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Given the freedom to leave Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union, 
Tamara Moskvina seemed like a good candidate to do so. The dollars, after all, 
are greener on the other side. One famous figure skating coach left for 
California. Another left for New York. So why not Moskvina? 
</P>
<P>
 When I met her this week in the city where she has been involved in pairs 
figure skating for more than three decades, first as a competitor who won a 
silver medal in the World Championships and later as a coach who groomed two 
Olympic gold medalists and two silver medalists, she was frazzled. 
</P>
<P>
 She is not responsible for the problems that the Yubileiny Sports Palace had 
producing ice, but it is the rink where she coaches and she wanted to do 
anything she could to help. A proud woman, she was a little embarrassed. But 
just a little. 
</P>
<P>
 As others who know and love Russia have pointed out, an ice rink with no ice 
might be an inconvenience for the Goodwill Games, but it hardly rates among the 
country's most dispiriting problems. Workers with no jobs and markets with no 
food, those are problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But just as the Russians eventually mustered their energy and their know-how 
and put Yubileiny on-line Thursday night for the figure skating competition, 
Moskvina said they will do the same for their country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russian people are very talented, very enthusiastic and have often found it 
necessary to find the answers to difficult situations," she said. "We have a 
very strong character." 
</P>
<P>
 She is concerned, however, that it might take longer because the city that 
Peter the Great founded as Russia's "Window to the West" has been so widely 
opened, especially to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not happy with the intrusion of the American culture," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She fears that it will make Russians, well, less Russian. 
</P>
<P>
 She already has noticed it in her sport. It was easier in the past, she said, 
to lure Russian skaters to the Kirov Ballet, now the Mariinsky, which they used 
as inspiration for their performances. Now, she said, they are more interested 
in rock videos. 
</P>
<P>
 That does not mean, she emphasized, that she dislikes the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like America very much," she said. "But it is not my home. I am Russian, 
and St. Petersburg is my home. How do you like it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beautiful," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now," she said, "you know why everyone does not want to emigrate." RANDY 
HARVEY

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; HENLEY RETURNS FROM LONG 'OFF-SEASON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cornerback Darryl Henley was back in a Ram uniform Thursday, rejoining the 
team that released him last May after he was indicted on federal drug 
trafficking charges -- and saying that football is the only thing he's worried 
about right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just had a longer off-season," Henley said, describing a sabbatical from 
the NFL that began Oct. 5 with a leave of absence after federal agents began 
investigating his alleged role in a cocaine distribution network they say 
operated out of his home in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 Several outraged callers to the Rams' Anaheim headquarters Thursday weren't 
nearly as nonchalant, one going so far as to say he was canceling his season 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, awaiting a Jan. 10 trial, on Wednesday signed a one-year, $350,000 
contract that includes several incentive clauses. He worked out twice with the 
team Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley refused to talk about the specifics of the drug charges after the 
morning practice, saying only that they hadn't been a distraction in his 
preparation for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "None (at all)," he said. "I act like you guys (reporters) aren't even there. 
That's my focus. It's only a distraction if I let it become a distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to say anything or relate to anything concerning the things 
that have happened. I've been directed by counsel, and that's the best way."

EXPERIMENTAL TWILIGHT RACING AT DEL MAR TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While not quite following the lead of the Chicago Cubs out of the daylight and 
into the night, the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club will approach the edge of 
darkness today. 
</P>
<P>
 First post for an experimental twilight program, the track's first, will be 4 
p.m. The card will be shortened to eight races, the seventh being the featured 
Honey Fox Handicap, because of the flirtation with dusk.The last race is 
expected to be run at 7:25. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're successful, I think we might be interested in a lighted program," 
said Dan Smith, Del Mar's director of marketing and media. "But I don't think 
we'd do it like Hollywood Park and go 7 to 11 (p.m.). I think we'd be more 
likely to start at 4 and not worry about running out of light with a nine-race 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 At present, Del Mar has no lights for racing. DAVE DISTEL

PARISH JOINS HORNETS AS MOURNING'S BACKUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Parish, arriving with three NBA championship rings and a pending 
invitation to the Hall of Fame, insists he doesn't mind taking a backup role 
with the Charlotte Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
 "My ego has been in check for a long time," the nine-time All-Star center of 
the Boston Celtics said Thursday after signing a multi-year contract with the 
Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming off the bench behind a fine young center like Alonzo Mourning fits my 
style," said the 7-foot Parish, the NBA's oldest player, who will turn 41 on 
Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 While terms weren't disclosed, published reports said Parish agreed to a 
two-year deal with an optional third year, and a guarantee of about $5.5 
million. That amount would increase to about $7.5 million if Parish plays three 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Parish expects to play about 10 to 15 minutes a game, sometimes alongside 
Mourning, the Hornets' 6-10 center.

OLD FRIEND LOVULLO WEARS A DIFFERENT CAP; BASEBALL: FORMER ANGEL INFIELDER WAS 
CALLED UP BY THE MARINERS JUST IN TIME FOR A VISIT TO ANAHEIM STADIUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Torey Lovullo walked into familiar surroundings this week at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of heading for the home team's clubhouse, as he had so many times 
before, he went through the doors marked "Visitors." 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside, he pulled on the gray pants and blue practice jersey of the 
Seattle Mariners, slipped on a cap with an 'S' on it and headed to the field. 
</P>
<P>
 His work day was just beginning, but waves of emotion had already started 
rolling over him. This was his first game back in the major leagues and his 
first day back at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovullo, 29, was an Angel for only one season, but memories and friendships 
die hard. Heck, Prime Ticket almost nightly runs a tape of Lovullo hurling his 
batting helmet into the air after his hit beat the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 J.T. Snow, Lovullo's best friend on the Angels and his roommate when they were 
members of the Yankee organization, is the enemy now, along with other buddies 
such as Gary DiSarcina and Chad Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The visitors' locker room is the other way," Angel pitcher Russ Springer 
said, cracking a smile when he spotted Lovullo in the hallway leading to the 
clubhouses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russell, how are you?" Lovullo said, shaking Springer's hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "My best friends in the game are on that team," Lovullo had told a reporter 
earlier. "It was hard. I had talked to J.T. on the phone. Now, seeing them all 
together, that was strange. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just glad to be back home in Anaheim. I'm excited. I want to stick it to 
(the Angels). I want to have the game on the line and do a number on them. 
There's going to be a lot of emotion." 
</P>
<P>
 Lovullo, from UCLA, played in 116 major league games last year, a career-high, 
batting .251 with six home runs and 30 runs batted in. They were modest numbers 
to be sure, but Lovullo's impact extended beyond statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Two clutch hits stand out in the Angels' unexpectedly successful first half of 
'93. Each built excitement when none was expected. Without those sorts of 
contributions, the Angels this season have fallen into what seems to be an 
emotional abyss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to think they might be missing me," Lovullo said. "Obviously, 
they've gone in a different direction and didn't see a need for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels released Lovullo during spring training, opting instead for Rex 
Hudler and Spike Owen as their utility infielders. Each has contributed, and 
Owen, playing a position other than shortstop for the first time in his career, 
has become the everyday third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovullo was stung by the move, but now says he only had himself to blame. 
After his first full season as a major league player, he said he eased up a 
little bit, didn't work as hard as usual over the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps he fooled himself with his success. There were reasons to be content 
as an Angel. 
</P>
<P>
 In an early season game against Boston and Roger Clemens, Lovullo hit what 
turned out to be the game-winning homer in a 2-1 Angel victory. The Angels' 
postgame mood was joyous. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on the day before the All-Star break, Lovullo's bases-loaded single in 
the 14th inning gave the Angels a 3-2 victory over the Yankees. It also pulled 
the Angels within two games of first place in the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
 You've probably seen the tape dozens of times by now, maybe without realizing 
what it was. Half running, half skipping, Lovullo rounded first base, tore off 
his helmet and chucked it into the sky. In a flash, he was mobbed by teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports, L.A. style.  
</P>
<P>
 If there was a defining moment of the Angels' fast start, that was it. After 
the break, they faltered, unable to keep pace in the AL West. But Lovullo 
always hoped management would remember the good times of '93. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end of spring training, the Angels cut him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll fault myself for the rest of my life," said Lovullo, who was claimed 
from the waiver wire by Seattle April 1. "I wasn't ready for spring training. I 
felt last year I would be ready without working the way I did before. I was 
kind of shocked. I knew they had to make a move, but (getting released) was the 
last thing on my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Time has passed, but Lovullo can't forget his past as an Angel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be lying if I said I didn't think a lot about last year," he said. "It's 
baseball. It's a business. (But) I had an awfully good time here last year." 
</P>
<P>
 This week proved to be another adventure in the business side of the game for 
Lovullo. Tuesday, he traded places with 19-year-old shortstop Alex Rodriguez, 
who was optioned to triple-A Calgary. It marks Lovullo's third stint in the 
major leagues this season. In 30 games so far, he has hit .213 with two homers 
and seven RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 This visit to the majors, however, appears doomed by the expected players' 
strike, which is set to begin Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Lovullo searches for his niche with the Mariners. When he was a 
member of the Detroit Tigers, Sparky Anderson said something to the effect that 
it would take an act of Congress to get Lovullo out of the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Several seasons have passed since then and Lovullo is still trying to hustle 
an everyday spot in a major league lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss the heck out of them," he said of his former teammates. "But you have 
to move on. I think I need to get in the lineup and show how I can play the 
game."

ANGEL DROPS IN AT FIRST; SATRIANO TO HELP HIS SON COACH IN CABA WORLD SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Westlake Senators needed a hand. So they called on a guy who was as handy 
as any player who ever wore a California Angels uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Senators, a traveling team of 14-year-old players from the Valley, 
Ventura County and West L.A., approached a key tournament, they persuaded Nick 
Satriano to come aboard as coach. Satriano, 24, is the baseball coach at Malibu 
High, which opened its doors two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In doing so, the Senators tapped into a baseball gold mine. After winning the 
tournament to qualify for the Continental Amateur Baseball Assn. World Series, 
Manager Lory Goldstein enlisted the services of Nick's father, Tom, who played 
for 10 years in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senators (29-6, 9-2 in CABA competition) begin play today in the CABA 
series at Avery Field in Dublin, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 The series is for teams affiliated with the American Amateur Baseball 
Congress, which fields age-group teams in divisions named after Stan Musial, 
Connie Mack and Sandy Koufax. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24-team series is a round-robin tournament that concludes Aug. 13. 
Westlake, which won the state title last month in Monterey Park, will face 
Hawaii today. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Satriano, 53, will coach first base for the Senators. In his 10-year 
big-league career -- which began with a bang when he homered for his first hit 
in 1961 -- Satriano played for the Angels and Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the definitive utility player and was nicknamed "Mr. Everything," while 
playing for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 During one doubleheader in the sweltering heat of New York, he played first, 
second and third base in the first game, then caught and played third in the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1964, his fourth season with the Angels, Satriano played all four infield 
positions, plus 25 games at catcher. He compiled a lifetime average of .225. 
</P>
<P>
 Satriano hit only 21 career homers. Heck, he had to hit the first one twice. 
</P>
<P>
 While playing in Baltimore during his rookie season, he homered in the third 
inning off Dick Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was rounding third, I felt a drop of rain hit my shoulder," Satriano 
said. "By the time I got to the dugout, it was a deluge." 
</P>
<P>
 The game was rained out and so was the homer. A week later in Cleveland, he 
homered in the ninth inning off Mudcat Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a guy who hit 21 homers in his whole career, that's a pretty funny way to 
start," Satriano said. 
</P>
<P>
 Satriano lives in West Los Angeles and runs an accounting firm in that 
community. He has coached his son's youth league teams many times before and 
doesn't plan to do much for the Senators other than enjoy the ride and watch 
his son run the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just going to sit back, watch what happens and maybe give some occasional 
advice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Satriano helped out at a handful of practices as the Senators readied for 
their series run. Of course, his son had to tell the players about his father's 
career -- which ended long before the players were born. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, they generally welcomed his sage advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always a challenge," Satriano said. "Everybody has their way of doing 
things. Eventually, they usually come around." 
</P>
<P>
 Satriano can come around as often as he would like, as far as Lory Goldstein 
is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been wonderful with the kids," said the Senators' manager, who lives in 
Westlake Village. "It's a great baseball family. They fit right in with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Family, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Gina Satriano, Tom's daughter, is a pitcher with the Silver Bullets, the 
recently formed all-female hardball team. Nick played at UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Satriano likes the Senators' chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell you what, this team has some talent," he said. "They've got some good 
arms, good team speed and a couple of pretty good catchers." 
</P>
<P>
 He qualifies as a good catch himself.

FERNANDEZ IN A SUB CONSCIOUS STATE; BASEBALL: ROLE OF BACKUP LONG HAS BEEN 
FAMILIAR TO PHOENIX CATCHER AND FORMER CSUN QUARTERBACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The memory unfolds like a dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Fernandez looks up from the on-deck circle and into the crowd at 
Candlestick Park. He hears no sounds in this silent-screen recollection. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants trail, 8-7, with two out in the bottom of the eighth inning. The 
tying run is on third base. 
</P>
<P>
 As Fernandez takes his place in the batter's box one phrase echoes in his 
head: "Get a good pitch. Get a good pitch. Get a good . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The first pitch approaches in what seems like slow motion. A ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The next pitch arrives. Fernandez swings and strokes a clean base hit to right 
field. Tie score. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez is standing at first base, soaking in the scene. The crowd is 
cheering, but he doesn't hear it. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco Giants are playing the Oakland A's in the Bay Series, just 
before the start of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, Fernandez's hit -- off Ed Vosberg, a journeyman left-hander -- 
has knotted the score in nothing more than a practice game. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Fernandez, the hit might as well have come off Sandy Koufax in the 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Big league park. Big league uniform. Family back home in San Lorenzo, Calif., 
watching on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years toiling in the minor leagues for this moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "For just about five seconds, that was much bigger than just an RBI-hit in an 
exhibition game," Fernandez said. "It was really neat." 
</P>
<P>
 How soon the bubble bursts. Six pitches later, Fernandez is picked off first. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality bites. 
</P>
<P>
 If, as Andy Warhol claims, each person experiences 15 minutes of fame in a 
lifetime, Fernandez figures he has plenty of time remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 He is sitting at his cubicle in the clubhouse of the Phoenix Firebirds, the 
Giants' affiliate in the triple-A Pacific Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
 In a little less than two hours, the Firebirds will play host to the Colorado 
Springs Sky Sox. But, for the most part, Fernandez's work is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 He has caught pitchers working in the bullpen. He has taken his requisite 
hacks in the batting cage. He has listened to batting coach Duane Espy tell 
him, for the umpteenth time, what a fine swing he has. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he will sit and watch the game from the dugout. This is his routine as the 
backup catcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasn't this always been his routine? 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez, 28, hasn't been a starter since he was a two-sport star at Chabot 
College, a junior college in Northern California. Even at Cal State Northridge 
he was a backup -- in two sports, no less. 
</P>
<P>
 Always the usher, never the groom. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez came to Northridge in the fall of 1985 on a football scholarship, 
expecting to be "the star quarterback." It never happened. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first season with the Matadors, Fernandez lost a close battle with 
Chris Parker, another junior college transfer, for the job as starting 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker, who later played arena football, set school records for passes 
attempted and completed in a season. In two seasons Fernandez passed for fewer 
than 800 yards. So much for a career on the gridiron.  
</P>
<P>
 He went out for baseball as an afterthought and saw even less game action than 
he did in football. In two seasons he played in 18 games and had only 44 
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 As Parker was in football, Fernandez said, Northridge catcher Scott McIntyre 
was "the better player." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, George Genovese, a renowned Giant scout in the area, thought enough of 
Fernandez's catching skills to sign him as a free agent late in the summer of 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Genovese was taking much of a gamble. The only signing bonus 
Fernandez received was an airline ticket to Arizona for the fall instructional 
league. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in his seventh professional season, Fernandez has defied the odds. He 
survived a .226 batting average in his rookie season at Class-A Clinton, Iowa, 
in 1988. He survived three stops in Class-A San Jose, and three more in 
double-A Shreveport, La. This is his third stint in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way he has been understudy to major leaguers Steve Decker, Scooter 
Tucker and Jim McNamara. "If you want to make it to the big leagues," Fernandez 
said with a laugh, "I'm the guy to have behind you." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Alfonso, manager of the Firebirds, has been in professional baseball 26 
years as a player and coach. He is sure there have been other players who 
battled their way up to triple A despite never winning a full-time job. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I can't name one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his minor-league career, Fernandez has 901 at-bats. For a regular, that's 
about two full seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 During one stretch this season, Phoenix played 69 games in 68 days. Fernandez 
played consecutive games only once -- when starter Tom Lampkin missed a 
four-game series in Vancouver because of an illness. 
</P>
<P>
 The longest extended periods of playing time in Fernandez's career were the 40 
games he played in two months for the Firebirds last season and a streak of 16 
consecutive games for Shreveport two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Stablefeldt, a Northridge assistant, used to tell Fernandez the first 
thing he would learn in the minors was his "breaking point" -- the juncture at 
which the grind of catching every day exceeds a player's physical capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still haven't found out what mine is," Fernandez said. "In my role, I 
probably never will." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledges that hitting has been a career-long problem. Fernandez has 
never hit better than .263 in a season, which he accomplished in all of 76 
at-bats for San Jose in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hitting was the problem early," Alfonso said. "Now it's the inability to get 
more playing time to find out just how much he really has improved." 
</P>
<P>
 By watching and listening, Fernandez said, he has improved plenty, a claim 
supported by Alfonso. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dan is one of the few guys I've seen in this game who has improved every 
year," Alfonso said. "If he had a little more experience in school, before he 
signed, I'm not so sure he wouldn't have made the big leagues by now." 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, he has mastered some of the fundamentals of hitting only recently, 
occasionally to the surprise of baffled teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I notice things and will say something to a guy who plays all the 
time and he'll look at me like I just came out of Little League," said 
Fernandez, who is batting .260 in 100 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here I am, in my seventh year, and I'm just now experiencing some success at 
this stuff. There's no substitute for actually doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez's game is similar to that of Kirt Manwaring. The Giants' Gold 
Glove-winning catcher is a .240 hitter who calls a good game and is strong 
defensively. Fernandez threw out almost half of the runners who attempted to 
steal on him last season and committed eight errors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say I catch about as well as it can be done," Fernandez said. "They just 
want to see me become a little more consistent (as a hitter) at the plate." 
</P>
<P>
 And therein, of course, lies the paradox. How might the Giants expect 
consistent play from one who so rarely plays? 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez has considered the same question "about a thousand times." 
</P>
<P>
 "That had always been an excuse, kind of a crutch for me. 'They don't play me 
regularly. That's why I don't hit.' Finally, I said forget it. There are no 
excuses. When you play, produce. That's it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez's attitude has made him a favorite throughout the Giants 
organization. Said Alfonso, who formerly headed the entire minor league system: 
"Every time we'd have meetings, there was always a manager who wanted him. He's 
that kind of kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Fernandez doesn't grapple with bitterness occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes," he said, "I get really depressed and tired of doing what I'm 
doing -- or what I'm not doing. But then I go home, think about it a little 
bit, and come back the next day hungrier than I've ever been. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, I'm not where I want to be, but . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 He gestures toward his teammates cavorting around the Firebird clubhouse. 
There is carpet on the floor, a stereo system, a television hookup and 
air-conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
 Many professional ballplayers have it a lot worse. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . I'm doing basically what I want to be doing." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the big leagues, but not the bush leagues, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey," he said, "considering what they probably expected out of me when I 
started, I'm in triple A and still playin'. That's not too bad."

GOING AGAINST TIDE OF TIME; AT 43, VENTURA'S MCCONICA OUT OF SYNC IN BID TO 
REPRISE 1983 CATALINA CHANNEL SWIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARKUSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim McConica's biological clock was ticking. It wasn't enough that he had the 
job, the wife, the kids, and the house on the hill a few blocks from the 
Ventura high school where he was a star swimmer in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, at 42, Jim McConica was running out of time. He had become his 
own ultimate nightmare, a man without a challenge. So he recycled an old one 
and devoted a year to it. 
</P>
<P>
 He would again swim the 22-mile stretch from Catalina Island to the nearest 
shore on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, proving that middle age precludes nothing, 
that what matters most is the mind and the man. 
</P>
<P>
 He even convinced himself that he could break the record he set in 1983 -- 8 
hours 27 minutes -- which is recognized by the Catalina Channel Swimming 
Federation in Manhattan Beach. Then, when he discovered in September of last 
year that some 24-year-old kid from Texas had shaved 13 minutes off his mark, 
that just made McConica even more determined. He had his challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, at precisely midnight, McConica dove into the Pacific Ocean. He went 
after his past. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was quite a past. As a senior in 1969, he led the Buena High swim team 
to a Southern Section championship. On scholarship at USC, he won two gold 
medals and one silver at the 1971 Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
 The next challenge was Munich and the 1972 Olympics. Among the swimmers 
competing with him for a berth on the U.S. team was a kid from Indiana named 
Mark Spitz. A year earlier, McConica said, he had become the first U.S. swimmer 
-- following Spitz -- to swim the 200-yard freestyle in less than 1:40. 
</P>
<P>
 But McConica traveled to Germany at his own expense. He missed qualifying for 
the team by one place -- by one-tenth of a second. "It was very disappointing," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He competed for another year, but he knew he couldn't spend his life in the 
water. There was a career in the real world to build. His grandfather had 
founded a car dealership in Ventura in 1929 and McConica's father had assumed 
the business. Now it was his turn to work there. 
</P>
<P>
 He gave up swimming for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just burned out," he said. "Swimming wasn't part of my life anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't resist the sport forever, though. In the early 1980s, he dove 
right back into the deep end. With only two weeks of preparation, he made his 
first Catalina swim in October, 1982, at the age of 31. It took him more than 
nine hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't lift my arms over my head for days," he recalled. "I thought I had 
done some serious damage to myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, he began preparations for another channel swim the next summer. 
This time, he trained thoroughly. This time, he set the record, breaking the 
old mark by six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 One channel conquered, he set out for another, the most famous of all. In 
1988, he navigated the English Channel in 8 hours 39 minutes which, he is proud 
to say, was the second-fastest time of the 60 attempts that summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Back home, he competed in a series of swimming events. In 1989, he was ranked 
third in the country among long-distance swimmers. Peter Daland, his USC coach, 
said McConica's success in the channel swims surprises him. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a guy who was a middle-distance swimmer in college, it's a big jump to go 
22 miles in the sea," Daland said. "He's effective from 50 yards all the way to 
22 miles, and very few people have that range." 
</P>
<P>
 While still competing in long-distance races, suddenly last summer the idea of 
another Catalina run hit him again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to do it again before I was too old," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He began training a year ago, working on his mind first. Since the Catalina 
Channel Swimming Federation started to keep thorough records in the early 
1970s, more than 50 people have completed the swim. But more than twice as many 
quit in the ocean. The federation charts swims from Catalina to Palos Verdes -- 
McConica's route -- and vice versa, as well as other destinations to and from 
the island. 
</P>
<P>
 "The toughest part is to get yourself mentally committed," McConica said. 
"Once you do that, the physical part is easier." 
</P>
<P>
 The mental part got help from Chad Hundeby. He's the Texas upstart who set the 
record last summer. He also happens to be one of the nation's best marathon 
swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just locked the whole thing into place," McConica said. "It was 
inevitable" that someone would break it. "I was happy that it had lasted 10 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 For almost a year, he swam an average of 31 miles a week. In the last month, 
he rose at 4 a.m. six days a week to practice alone in the ocean near Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was more physically and mentally prepared than I was for the other three 
channel swims," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He had even scouted the elements. On the night before the swim, he measured 
the ocean's currents and plotted his pace. For the first four hours, he would 
take 68 strokes per minute, then work up to 72 for the second four hours. 
</P>
<P>
 He would be closely monitored by a six-member crew on a 32-foot sailboat. The 
crew, which included a federation observer and his brother who had flown in 
from Colorado, was responsible for counting his strokes and the miles he had 
traveled. 
</P>
<P>
 The swim started at midnight, and it didn't take long for McConica to realize 
he was in hot water. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the currents were stronger than the crew's projections, which meant 
McConica couldn't swim on a straight line. He was swimming farther and gaining 
less ground than he needed to make record time. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when he took 10-second breaks for food and water every 15 minutes and 
was informed by the crew of his status, he remained confident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was waiting for the currents to change," he said. "They had changed the 
night before." 
</P>
<P>
 Not on this night, however. He also faced rough seas. Two hours into the swim, 
McConica felt seasick. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4:30 a.m., shortly after the halfway point, he realized the record was 
impossible. The currents hadn't changed. "It then became a situation where I 
was just trying to complete the swim," he said. "All I had worked for the whole 
year was gone." 
</P>
<P>
 An hour later, seasickness overwhelmed him -- he threw up a dozen times -- and 
he aborted the swim. "I might have been a little stronger mentally," he said, 
"if I had been in a record-breaking position." 
</P>
<P>
 The crew pulled him into the boat. His parents greeted him at the shore and he 
trudged home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I let a lot of people down," he said, "the people on the boat, 
and all those who helped me through the year." 
</P>
<P>
 McConica also disappointed himself. The challenge had not been met. 
</P>
<P>
 Will he try again? He looks away. No answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Was he simply a victim of unlucky circumstances? Or has Jim McConica, the 
former Buena High standout, the Trojan gold-medal winner, the man who missed 
Munich by one-tenth of a second, finally, at age 43, come face to face with 
Father Time? 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep trying to fight old age," he said. "I don't want to cave in to it. I 
don't want to think about it."

WRIGHT STILL HAS STUFF TO ESCAPE A TOUGH JAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jaret Wright could have cracked. It would have been the easy thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright had runners on second and third and no outs in the first inning. 
Normally, it would be no sweat. He'd just blow the next three batters away, 
just as he had done for Katella High School this spring. But this was 
different. This was for money. 
</P>
<P>
 He was pitching for Burlington (N.C.) in his first professional game. People 
were watching, people from the Cleveland Indians' front office who had dished 
out a $1.2-million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 "My nerves got to me," Wright said. "I figured I better do something. I needed 
to get my head straight right then." 
</P>
<P>
 Three batters, three strikeouts. Problems? What problems? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a normal game after that," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright overcame his jitters quickly against Martinsville (Va.) in his debut 
Wednesday. He struck out the side in the first, showing the Indian officials in 
attendance why they had paid such a hefty fee for his services. 
</P>
<P>
 Some scouts have predicted that Wright will be in the major leagues within 
three years and he took a first step toward living up to those expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, who was scheduled to throw 60 pitches, went 2 2/3 innings, striking 
out four. He gave up two hits, walked three and left with two runners on base. 
Both scored. Martinsville won, 5-4, but Wright was not involved in the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a big, strong kid and has great stuff," said Jim Cabella, Burlington's 
manager. "That's the makings of a pretty good pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wright, who left with a 2-0 lead, was just happy to be done with that 
first outing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember when I've been more nervous," Wright said. "I walked the 
first guy on four pitches. That didn't help. There was such a buildup to the 
whole thing. It's been that way for a couple weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was hard for Wright to avoid such treatment. He was, after all, under a 
microscope. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians drafted Wright with the 10th pick overall in the June draft. Like 
everyone else, they had been impressed with his 90 m.p.h. fastball. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright was 7-2 with a 2.98 earned-run average for Katella last season. He 
struck out 100 batters in 75 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential costs a bundle and negotiations dragged on. Wright finally signed 
July 21 amid much fanfare at Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
 "They brought me to the stadium that night and flashed that I had signed on 
the message board," said Wright, the son of former Angel pitcher Clyde Wright. 
"I got a tour of the ballpark and threw some in the bullpen. I was there three 
days and it was great." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting back there is going to take some work. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright was assigned to Burlington, a Class-A team. His reputation, or at least 
the size of his bonus, preceded him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got there and the guys wanted me to buy a new team bus," Wright said. "I 
kind of had to put my foot down. I told them, 'I'm making the same amount of 
money as you guys.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Well, give or take a million. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, I have a little more money," Wright said. "But the bus looked in fine 
shape to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright believed he was ready to pitch immediately. He had worked out at his 
father's pitching school and pitched in a couple of Connie Mack games for the 
Orange County Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Indians were taking no chances with their investment. Wright pitched 
in simulated games and threw in the bullpen before he was allowed to start. 
</P>
<P>
 The time allowed him to adjust off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time I've lived away from home," Wright said. "It's a 
change. For one thing, I have to go out and buy some food. The fridge is 
empty." 
</P>
<P>
 That problem was easy. Wright and his three roommates live across the street 
from a fast-food place. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a McDonald's and a mall," Wright said. "That's it. Burlington is a 
small place." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a 1 1/2-hour bus ride to Martinsville. Wright did his best calm his 
nerves. It wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Robertson, the Indians' scouting director, was coming to see Wright's 
first game. Back in Orange County, his parents were listening to the game over 
the telephone. A family friend who lives in the Burlington area placed the 
receiver next to the radio so the Wrights could hear the broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 So much attention didn't help.  
</P>
<P>
 "I slept on the bus, but when I woke up, I got nervous again," Wright said. 
"After I walked the first guy, I figured I better find the strike zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Things didn't get much better when the second batter reached on an infield 
single. A double steal left runners on second and third, but Wright overpowered 
the next three hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cabella: "Yeah, he was a little shaky at first. But after that first 
batter, he settled down and just let it go."

DUKES HOPING TO AVOID REPEAT OF '93 COLLAPSE; TEAMTENNIS: NEWPORT BEACH IS 
AGAIN THE FAVORITE IN THE PLAYOFFS. BUT IDAHO AND NEW JERSEY COULD PRESENT 
PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the World TeamTennis season began four weeks ago, Dukes owner Fred 
Lieberman said he had the league's best team on paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Four weeks, 14 victories and no losses later, Lieberman is wearing a 
self-satisfying "I-told-you-so" smile. 
</P>
<P>
 But after what happened to the Dukes in the last two WTT finals, Lieberman was 
not about to make any such statements before his team's semifinal match tonight 
in Sacramento against Idaho, which defeated Sacramento, 28-23, in Wednesday's 
quarterfinal. New Jersey meets San Antonio on Saturday in the other semifinal. 
The final is scheduled Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an old ballplayer (in the minor leagues), I'm very superstitious," 
Lieberman said. "I don't want to say anything to jinx us." 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberman still feels a little spooked after witnessing last year's collapse 
against Wichita in the final. The Dukes entered the last set holding a 
one-point lead with their best event -- mixed doubles -- to come. But Trevor 
Kronemann, last year's male co-MVP, opened the set by having his serve broken. 
The Dukes went on to lose the set, 6-2, and the match, 26-23. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little numb watching that," Lieberman said. "I still don't understand 
what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dukes finished the 1993 season with a 13-1 record, but they were even more 
dominating this season. Only their victories over New Jersey and Idaho were 
close -- both were won by a point. Every other match was all but decided long 
before the last set. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dukes had the top men's singles player and WTT male MVP in Kelly Jones, 
who won 80 games and lost 47 (.630), the second-best women's singles record 
(.583), compiled mainly by Zina Garrison Jackson and Larisa Neiland, the top 
women's doubles record (.585), compiled mainly by Garrison Jackson and Neiland, 
and the second-best mixed doubles record (.574), compiled mainly by Kronemann 
and Neiland. 
</P>
<P>
 The men's doubles team of Kronemann and Jones was ranked third, but it won 
more than 57% of its games. 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberman says the key to his team's perfect season has been Neiland, a 
28-year-old Latvian who had not played team tennis until this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larisa would be my MVP of the league," Lieberman said. "I didn't know her 
game that well, but based what people that I trust told me, I knew she'd be 
good. They told me she'd be the find of the year. I think she was clearly the 
difference in our team. We don't have a weakness, even though some people 
thought it might be Larisa." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the league agreed with Lieberman because she was named WTTs rookie 
of the year and female MVP. Ranked as the third-best doubles player on tour, 
Neiland also stood out in singles this season. While Garrison Jackson was in 
Germany playing in the Federation Cup, Neiland filled in and won 26 of 42 
games. Her .619 winning percentage was the highest of any women's singles 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dukes' winning percentage of 1.000 was the highest of any team in league 
history. Still, Lieberman said a couple teams make him uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a lock for us," he said. "New Jersey (11-3) and Idaho (9-6) can 
beat us on any given day. On paper, Idaho was the second best team this year. 
I'm nervous about playing them. They have more emotion than any team that could 
play us because they all played here last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberman's emotions about his perfect regular season are somewhat mixed. One 
minute he's smiling about his team's success on the court, the next minute he's 
looking up into the stands at John Wayne Tennis Club and grimacing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lieberman sold some 1,100 season tickets, he rarely had more than 600 
or 700 people in the stands. The crowd of 2,487 to see Jimmy Connors' Phoenix 
Smash was the only box-office highlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (lack of support) makes this a little bittersweet," Lieberman said. "This 
is a tough town. In other towns like Boise and Sacramento, tennis is the only 
thing going on. Here you've got yuppie boxing (in Irvine), summer league 
basketball and Magic Johnson, two baseball teams. It's a very competitive area 
for the entertainment dollar." 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberman discounted the notion that his ticket prices ($15 and $25) were too 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's the money," he said. "It's the complacency, the attitude. 
The parking situation at the (John Wayne Tennis) club isn't ideal and I'm sure 
that turns some people away." 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberman already has talked about selling the franchise after the season, but 
he said he hasn't made up his mind yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning changes a lot of things," he said. "One tends to forget all the empty 
seats. Then again, if I do sell, this could be the way to go out. I've never 
won anything like this before." Dukes in the Playoffs 
</P>
<P>
 What: World TeamTennis Playoffs 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Gold River Racquet Club in Gold River, a suburb of Sacramento. The 
outdoor club seats 2,400. 
</P>
<P>
 Semifinal matchups: Newport Beach Dukes (14-0) vs. Idaho Sneakers (9-6), 
tonight at 7 p.m.; San Antonio Racquets (8-7) vs. New Jersey Stars (11-3), 
Saturday at 7 p.m. The winners meet Sunday at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Comments: Newport Beach, which has lost in the final the last two years, is 
unquestionably the team to beat. But Idaho and New Jersey have both come close 
to beating the Dukes this season before losing by one point. Idaho, coached by 
former Dukes and UC Irvine Coach Greg Patton, will be plenty motivated.Patton 
has two former Dukes, Manon Bollegraf and Amy Frazier, on his roster. His two 
men players are Rick and Jon Leach, the former Laguna Beach High and USC stars. 
Frazier finished the season with the best singles record of any female in the 
WTT (77-53 for a .592 percentage). New Jersey, led by Martina Navratilova 
(71-51 in singles, .582), will be the sentimental favorite of the Sacramento 
fans.

GILL IS PICKING HER SPOTS -- AND THRIVING; SURFING: CARLSBAD WOMAN WHO LEFT 
TOUR SIX YEARS AGO UPSETS WORLD CHAMPION MENCZER TO REACH QUARTERFINALS. 
</P>

 Tricia Gill left the women's surfing tour six years ago because the demands 
were wearing on her. She still wanted to surf, but not on demand. She wanted to 
choose when she would compete. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Gill chose to surf both the Op Pro and the U.S. Open of Surfing. 
Without the pressure of world standings and constant competition, she has 
shined in the two contests at Huntington Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, in the second round of the U.S. Open's main event, Gill, 28, took 
down the 1993 world champion, Pauline Menczer of Australia. At her mother's 
coaching, Gill took off on a wave with the opening buzzer. Instead of waiting 
for the best waves in the 3-5 foot surf, she chose to get started early. 
</P>
<P>
 With four minutes to go in the 25-minute heat, Menczer needed a 7.9 to move 
into the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking advantage of the priority buoy used in one-on-one competition, Gill 
kept Menczer from catching the wave she needed. Afterward, it was a mixture of 
emotions -- elation and relief for getting through the round, sadness with a 
little guilt for defeating her friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shocked. I know Pauline and she's really good," Gill said. "I really 
respect her. She gets three maneuvers to a wave." 
</P>
<P>
 Gill joined the tour when she was 18, and stayed four years. She quit when she 
was fifth in the standings and settled into a routine in Carlsbad, where she 
works nights at a grocery store and surfs with friends and neighbors during the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Gill will face Kylie Webb of Australia in the quarterfinals, which begin at 
2:20 p.m. today. Op Pro winner Frieda Zamba of Flagler Beach, Fla., faces 
Rochelle Ballard of Kuaui, Hawaii; Huntington Beach's Nea Post surfs against 
Kathy Newman of Australia, and top-seeded Lisa Andersen of Ormond Beach, Fla., 
faces Vanessa Osborne of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 In men's surfing, all four wild cards advanced to the third round. Surfing in 
better conditions at 6 a.m., former world champion Tom Curren caught three tube 
barrel rides in four waves. He scored a 9.17, the highest scoring ride of the 
day. One judge gave him a perfect 10. He now faces Australian Dave Macauley, 
who finished third on the 1993 world tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach's Richie Collins defeated Barton Lynch of Australia and will 
face Gary Elkerton in the first heat at 6 a.m. today. San Juan Capistrano's 
Shane Stoneman beat Australian Martin Potter by .03 points. He meets 1992 world 
champion Kelly Slater at 9:20 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Deffenbaugh of Huntington Beach has not surfed since he won his 
first-round heat Wednesday. In the third round, he faces Cardiff's Rob Machado 
at 11:50 a.m.

HALLOWED GROUND; ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY CAME FROM HUMBLE BEGINNINGS. BUT 
130 YEARS LATER,IT'S AMERICA'S MOST PRESTIGIOUS BURIAL SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a sultry summer morning at Arlington National Cemetery, Erwin Henry Shupp 
was buried on a grassy knoll as a bugler played taps and soldiers fired a rifle 
volley at the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 At 9 a.m., just after the bell tolled in a faraway cemetery clock tower, seven 
white horses pulled a gun carriage carrying a flag-covered casket with Shupp's 
cremated remains along a cemetery road, under the oak and magnolia trees, to 
his waiting grave. 
</P>
<P>
 His friends had called him Ed, this Army lieutenant colonel who loved to ride 
horses and had served as a field artillery officer in World War II, later 
working as a Southern California aerospace engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 But after eight painful years fighting cancer, Shupp finally took his place 
alongside so many other soldiers and statesmen here at Arlington National -- 
the most prestigious burial grounds in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same July day, 23 other funerals were held at Arlington. Some, like 
Shupp's, featured military honors -- a somber black gun carriage, or caisson, 
and an honor guard. Others were simple affairs attended by a few family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Established during the Civil War as a burial ground for Union soldiers, the 
cemetery has taken in the remains of more than 232,000 Americans, including 
Presidents and judges, admirals, astronauts, war heroes and social pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, 4.5 million tourists visit the graves of President John F. Kennedy; 
his wife, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis; his brother Sen. Robert Kennedy, and U.S. 
Supreme Court Justices Earl Warren, Oliver Wendell Holmes and William O. 
Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 At Arlington, soldiers and generals are buried side by side, fighting men and 
women sharing a field of realized dreams, their marble markers stretching out 
in elegant symmetry to the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It must make dying a little easier to know you'll be buried at Arlington," 
cemetery historian Kathy Shenkle said. "One thing is for sure, you'll be in 
good company for some time to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the names of those buried in Arlington's 612 acres read like some 
comprehensive American history book: Arctic explorers Robert E. Peary and 
Richard Byrd. President William Howard Taft. Boxing great Joe Louis. Audie 
Murphy, the most decorated World War II veteran. Statesman John Foster Dulles. 
World War II Gens. Omar Bradley and George C. Marshall. Scopes "Monkey Trial" 
prosecutor William Jennings Bryan. And Civil War veteran Abner Doubleday, 
credited in myth with the invention of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 With them are 21 Marines killed in a 1983 terrorist bombing in Lebanon, as 
well as the eight men who died in the failed 1980 attempt to rescue American 
hostages in Iran. And countless everyday soldiers who fought in World Wars I 
and II, in Korea and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 To join Arlington's ranks is no easy task: Most of those buried here qualified 
because they died on the battlefield, or on active military duty, or served the 
country at least 20 years. Others held the nation's highest military 
decorations or the Purple Heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "It meant a lot to him to be buried here," said one mourner at a military 
service. "You just can't put a price on it." 
</P>
<P>
 A day at Arlington provides a peaceful break from the intensity of the 
nation's capital just across the Potomac River. Boisterous onlookers suddenly 
quiet as they come upon the eternal flame at the JFK grave site and approach 
the Tomb of the Unknowns, guarded around the clock by a solitary sentinel. 
</P>
<P>
 An average of 18 funerals take place daily at Arlington, the second-largest 
national cemetery after Long Island National Cemetery in New York. At the 
height of the Vietnam war, 35 burials were held daily. 
</P>
<P>
 At the present rate, the cemetery will be filled by the year 2025. "Nobody," 
one worker said, "wants to see that day come." 
</P>
<P>
 Every morning, one half-hour before the first funeral, the flag outside 
Arlington House, once the home of Robert E. Lee, is lowered to half staff, 
where it remains until half an hour after the day's last ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 The cemetery's most elaborate ceremony, full honors, is reserved for the 
highest-ranking officers and includes a rifle salute, riderless horse with 
boots reversed in the stirrups, a military band and a casket carried on a 
horse-drawn caisson, flanked by members of the U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry 
Regiment, "the Old Guard." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Col. Albert Isler, a chaplain who presided over the Shupp ceremony, 
performed five other funerals that day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen bagpipe and harp players, gospel-singing soloists, even a boombox 
playing rap music," he said. "People add their own touches as a way of saying 
farewell." 
</P>
<P>
 Worse than summer funerals in humid northern Virginia are the wintertime 
ceremonies where stern-faced military honor guardsmen shiver under thin coats 
and white gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wind chill is 20-below, your hands are frozen, your nose is running, and 
you can't do anything about it," Isler said. "But you know the family is just 
as cold. They're suffering more than you." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its present-day grandeur, Arlington National Cemetery started as a 
virtual potter's field. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,100-acre plantation was once owned by John Parke Custis, the adopted son 
of President George Washington. It was eventually willed to Mary Lee -- wife of 
Robert E., then a young Army officer. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1861, with the Civil War approaching, Lee resigned his commission rather 
than bear arms against his native Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, federal troops crossed the Potomac and turned Arlington House into an 
Army headquarters. Three years later, the government confiscated the property, 
transforming a section into a cemetery for the legions of unidentified Union 
soldiers who had died at the hands of Lee's troops. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 15, 1864, there were 65 funerals on the estate. By war's end, the 
hillsides were marked by the headstones of 16,000 soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 As well, 482 Confederate soldiers and civilians are buried at Arlington, near 
an area called Freedman's Village, where 3,800 freed slaves are buried, their 
headstones marked only "Civilian" or "Citizen." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the decades, Arlington has perhaps become best known for its silent 
salute to four anonymous soldiers: The Tomb of the Unknowns remains the 
cemetery's most symbolic site. 
</P>
<P>
 In a large white sarcophagus lie the remains of soldiers from World Wars I and 
II, and from the Korean and Vietnam wars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is really what made veterans first notice 
Arlington cemetery," historian Shenkle said. "It's what made it a prestigious 
place in the eyes of many. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some argue that the cemetery's status comes from John Kennedy. But Arlington 
had already achieved its stature by then. That's why Kennedy was buried here in 
the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 While home to the country's honored dead, Arlington National continues to 
capture the imagination of its living: Shenkle is often deluged with questions 
about the place and its rituals. 
</P>
<P>
 The post-burial rifle volleys, for example, trace to the Civil War when the 
opposing armies fired such volleys to signal an end to the truces that were 
often declared to allow both sides to collect their dead and wounded from the 
battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
 Arlington is the only national cemetery that uses horse-drawn caissons to 
transport remains. Flags used to drape coffins are carefully folded in a 
triangular shape reminiscent of the soldiers' hats of the Revolutionary War. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Shenkle: "This job is like playing 20 Questions. There's still a lot of 
interest out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Another tradition is that of the Arlington Ladies -- a sisterhood of 150 
military wives and widows from the Army, Navy and Air Force -- at least one of 
whom attends every funeral to ensure no soldier goes to the grave alone. 
</P>
<P>
 They're professional mourners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Military funerals are ritualistic, rigid and just plain scary," said Pat 
Thompson, who attended the funeral for Shupp, the former artillery officer and 
aerospace engineer. She handed Shupp's closest relative at the service, his 
wife's sister, a note of thanks from the U.S. Army for his services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've stood by our husbands for the last 30 years while they served their 
country and can lend these widows a personal touch," Thompson said. "As for the 
men, we say that no one in the U.S. Army will ever die alone. One of us will 
always be there." Sometimes, an Arlington Lady is the only one there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Arlington funeral is the most moving experience on Earth," said Nancy 
Schado, head of the Army branch of the Arlington Ladies. "There's just 
something about the forlorn look of the caisson and the sound of the horses' 
hoofs. It sends goose bumps down my spine." 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven years ago, Schado buried her husband at Arlington with full military 
honors. She remembers walking behind the riderless horse, fighting back tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't get used to these funerals -- ever," she said. "But it's harder 
when you bury your own husband. You tell yourself nothing can hurt him anymore. 
You have to go forward, like he trained you to do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arlington National Cemetery often inspires emotion. But none perhaps as widely 
felt as on the day John F. Kennedy was buried here in November, 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 Columnist Jimmy Breslin, then a reporter for the now-defunct New York Herald 
Tribune, was among hundreds of journalists who covered the event. On the 
morning of the funeral, instead of trailing the Washington press corps, Breslin 
struck out on his own to Arlington. 
</P>
<P>
 He interviewed Clifton Pollard, a quiet, 42-year-old backhoe operator who 
spoke about the honor of digging the slain President's grave -- even if it was 
his day off. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that day Breslin has never returned to Arlington. With typical candor, 
he expressed doubts about the cemetery's mystique. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no good place to be buried," he said. "Man is always attempting to 
add some glory to death and is incapable of doing so. The ground speaks for 
itself. It opens up. And you're gone." 
</P>
<P>
 But on that afternoon 31 years ago, Breslin wrote with stylish strength about 
the mourning of both a nation and a widowed Jacqueline Kennedy -- with 
Arlington National as his stage: 
</P>
<P>
 This must be the worst time of all, when a woman sees the coffin with her 
husband inside and it is in place to be buried under the earth. Now she knows 
that it is forever. Now there is nothing. There is no casket to kiss or hold 
with your hands. Nothing material to cling to. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The ceremonies began, with jet planes roaring overhead and leaves falling from 
the sky. On this hill behind the coffin, people prayed aloud. They were 
cameramen and writers and soldiers and Secret Service men and they were saying 
prayers out loud and choking. In front of the grave, Lyndon Johnson kept his 
head turned to his right. He is President and he had to remain composed. It was 
better that he did not look at the casket and grave of John Fitzgerald Kennedy 
too often.  
</P>
<P>
 Then it was over and black limousines rushed under the cemetery trees and out 
onto the boulevard toward the White House.  
</P>
<P>
 "What time is it?" a man standing on the hill was asked. He looked at his 
watch.  
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty minutes past three," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is half-past 9 and the soldiers are carrying the urn with the remains 
of Lt. Col. Erwin Shupp toward the grave site. 
</P>
<P>
 A lone soldier, standing straight and tall and stone-faced, beats a snare 
drum, and the American flag is folded into triangles and handed to a family 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 On a nearby hill, a firing party squeezes off three successive volleys, the 
reports rolling again and again off the white grave markers of soldiers who 
rest in peace here.

BEHIND THE WHEEL: IN THE COMFORT ZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shop for an imported car and you will fit a snooty buyer profile that measures 
combined family income, number of sport utilities in the garage, your 
occupational status and college education. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who purchase mid-size Chevys demographically slip into something more 
comfortable. They conceivably have a lifetime bowling average of 155, log 
workweeks by hours, are on their first wife and third digital watch, still 
thirst for Utica Club, prefer Leno to Letterman and trust all appliances by 
Kenmore. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not talking down. 
</P>
<P>
 This is going eyeball to eyeball with mighty Middle America, the economic core 
of this nation and a significant corps of millions that daily spends billions 
on high-value generics by JCPenney, Sears, Radio Shack and General Motors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Three and Big Macs, in fact, couldn't survive without 'em. High 
technology and low production are not for these buyers. High value and low 
price certainly are. 
</P>
<P>
 So is Chevrolet's 1995 Lumina series, a typical mass-market lineup stretching 
from a four-door sedan that could snore on any shelf alongside Wonderbread, to 
a Monte Carlo redux that is livelier and much sportier than the lengthy, 
luxurious Montes of the '70s and '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Luminas are good, honest cars with base prices starting at $16,000, which 
is lower than the median price of a new import. Included in that cost is V-6 
power, automatic transmission, disc brakes, air conditioning, power steering 
and dual air bags. Also quiet room for six and anti-lock brakes that are a 
basement bargain at $386. 
</P>
<P>
 Even an uplevel Lumina LS with a heftier sound system, ABS and power windows 
still starts at only $17,495. 
</P>
<P>
 What one doesn't get in the base Lumina sedan is anything to stir the spirit. 
This is an automobile for those who really don't care what they drive as long 
as it gets them there. It adds nothing but a boring lump of metal to your 
driveway, features minimalist tweed upholstery and fuzzy liners, and is about 
as predictable as a tract home. 
</P>
<P>
 It also gets quite alarmed if asked to do anything dramatic involving 
steering, gas pedal or brakes over 73 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, a Lumina is safe, trustworthy transportation that does get 
you there and in complete comfort. The speed of its passage is acceptable. 
Controls are huge, of rubberized industrial build and can be operated while 
wearing boxing gloves. The refrigeration will chill a side of beef and the 
sturdy little 3.1-liter V-6 with 160 horsepower will easily live out this 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Monte Carlo shows much more vitality and charm. 
</P>
<P>
 It also bears no more resemblance to earlier generations than actor Wyatt Earp 
does to his fast-fingered ancestor. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank heavens. For although a certain sentiment lingers for Montes and their 
18-year ministry that ended in 1988, they were never quite the car you would 
take everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, they had V-8 power and up to 360 horsepower at times -- but blew most of 
it budging a car that weighed close to two tons. Yup, the name had a 
continental flourish -- but at 18 feet long with Ruebenesque fenders, this was 
nothing you'd want to try parking on the narrow and clotted streets of Monte 
Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
 One model worth a durn was the lighter, shorter SS of 1983. Everybody got to 
play NASCAR racer in this one. Three years later the speedy SS begat the Aero 
Coupe and sucked in more disciples. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, about the only holdovers for Monte Carlo's 1995 reincarnation are two 
doors and a modicum of distinction. 
</P>
<P>
 It now is a front-drive vehicle in two flavors, the Monte Carlo LS and Monte 
Carlo Z34. The SS is replaced at the top of the line by the Z34 with a sticker 
of $19,495. The cast-iron V-8 is no more and the available engines are both 
V-6s with aluminum heads: the 160-horsepower version and a 3.4 liter producing 
210 horsepower. 
</P>
<P>
 The heftier engine was standard power on our test car, a Monte Carlo Z34 in 
ace of hearts scarlet and distinguished by a discreet rear deck badge. It 
shares new hoofs -- conventional but quite handsome five-spoke, 16-inch 
aluminum wheels -- with the Monte Carlo LS. Both models have gaps for grilles, 
rather than the horizontal slits of the Lumina. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such touches of spiffiness -- which nicely elevate the two Montes from the 
Lumina's domestic, mill-run styling -- are carried to the insides. 
</P>
<P>
 A tachometer improves the visuals of the instrument cluster, although one 
could question its worth to the driver of any vehicle where shifting is by a 
four-speed automatic and mostly out of our hands. But the padded center console 
with cubby and cup holder have definite purpose. A centrally mounted gearshift 
has the feel of sportiness, if not essential function. 
</P>
<P>
 Vinyls appear richer than those in the Lumina. Seat fabrics -- with leather an 
option -- are of higher quality. And the front corners of the cabin are a very 
pleasing arc of walnut -- albeit faux -- curving from door to dashboard and 
framing door and window controls. 
</P>
<P>
 But save the Z34's rear seats for ill-tempered in-laws. Even with front chairs 
at a mid-point setting, it's a knee cruncher back there. 
</P>
<P>
 And use both eyes, all three mirrors and a double shoulder glance before 
changing lanes. Then repeat the scan. Because the car's broad, solid C-pillars 
will reduce vision better than a poke in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing superb about the performance and handling of the Z34. There 
also is nothing to hate about it either. Margins of speed and maneuvering 
precision are up to the level of some of the mid-size competition -- such as 
Ford Thunderbird -- and only a turn or two below very high standards set by the 
rest: Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and Chrysler's LH cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The trunk is large. Good sealing and insulation keep road noises and engine 
roar from disturbing the conversations and daydreams of occupants. Seating 
support is balanced nicely between bun-nipping buckets and slippery sofa. The 
Monte Carlo drinks regular unleaded and delivers about 23 m.p.g. 
</P>
<P>
 And if that sounds solid but average, capable but ordinary, so be it. There 
may, indeed, be high wisdom in designing in generalities and building populist. 
There's certainly a fiscal safety in the numbers of building a series such as 
the Chevrolet Lumina/Monte Carlo -- then rebadging and recycling it as Buick 
Regal, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and Pontiac Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Volvo sold 72,000 cars in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same 12 months, GM sold more than 500,000 Regals, Grand Prix, Cutlasses 
and Luminas.

that rules the world. 1995 Chevrolet Monte Carlo Z34

THE GOODS; ECONOTES; WHAT GOES AROUND MAY RETURN AS A PHONE BOOK

<P>
 The new Pacific Bell directories started arriving in Los Angeles households 
this week and, though it doesn't show, both the white pages and the yellow 
pages are considerably greener. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, they're using more recycled paper. The Integrated Waste 
Management Board in Sacramento reports that of the 112,000 tons of paper used 
to publish the 1994 directories, nearly 45% is recycled content paper, a huge 
increase over years past. The board, which oversees the state's landfills, has 
commended both Pacific Bell (11.7 million customers in California) and GTE (3.1 
million) for helping to divert paper from the landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 Being environmentally friendly is new for the phone directory. For the past 
few years, the book has suffered the paradox of being a major source of 
consumer information (it's estimated that approximately 500 people a minute 
look up something in the yellow pages in Los Angeles County) and a major 
irritant to environmentalists who deplore the wasted paper. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is particularly sharp in competitive Los Angeles, where as many as 
six hefty directories a year are deposited on each doorstep by the two phone 
companies and other commercial publishers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recycling is something we've looked at for some time," says Nancy Swasey, 
spokeswoman for the Pac Bell directories. Although phone books occupy less than 
half of 1% of the space in landfills, she said, "it's still a matter of being 
this large object that comes to your doorstep, and we didn't want it to be 
viewed negatively." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past few years since forming the Yellow Pages Environmental Network, 
the publishers have changed the directories by removing the shiny varnish from 
the covers, substituting nontoxic glues and inks, and working with paper 
suppliers to add up to 50% of recycled fiber. "There are phone books in the 
country that are 100% recycled fiber, but it adds so much bulk they're twice 
their original size, which defeats the purpose," Swasey says. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Pac Bell and GTE have launched numerous community outreach programs to 
get the books recycled. The new Pac Bell directories have a toll-free recycling 
information number printed on the cover. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been hard for recyclers to sell paper, but that's changing too," Swasey 
says. "Some cities (not Los Angeles) now have curbside programs that sell to 
our paper supplier Daishowa America in Port Angelus, Wash. They take the books 
back and we buy the paper from them. That's really closing the loop." 
</P>
<P>
 They're also seeking other uses for recycled phone books, Carrie Hyun of GTE 
says: "Our main mission now is to find companies or businesses (that) will 
recycle directories into other products. These presently include ceiling tiles, 
hydro-seeding mulch, paper towels and napkins, and others." Roundup

TECHNO WATCH: THE GOODS; BASEBALL SCORES AT A GLANCE

 Sure to be a hit with baseball fans is SportsTrax, a wireless 
sports-information monitor that delivers scores of your favorite team, inning 
by inning, on a beeper-size device you can hold in your hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, it is available only for the Chicago White Sox and the Toronto Blue 
Jays, but it is expected to be on-line for every major league team by the 
opening of the 1995 season. SportsTrax, from Motorola, is easily operated with 
one push-button and can be used in most urban areas. Commercial-free, the 
device gets game updates from the stadium press box -- usually within two 
minutes of the on-field activity. Its tiny screen displays the inning, the 
score, which team is at bat, the number of outs and the position of base 
runners. 
</P>
<P>
 A sound activator -- which can be turned off -- gives a variety of audible 
alerts to indicate the start of a game, end of an inning, run scored, home run 
and when there is a rally taking place. The screen also displays the previous 
game's score and the starting time of the next game. 
</P>
<P>
 Licensed by Major League Baseball Properties, SportsTrax ($149, including 
wrist strap) has no monthly fees and, for White Sox and Blue Jay fans, includes 
game updates (and playoffs) through the end of the 1997 season. The device 
operates on two AAA batteries, which Motorola reps say will last for half a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 To order a White Sox SportsTrax, call (800) 621-0521. For the Blue Jays 
version, call (800) 850-TRAX. And keep watching the skies for SportsTrax to 
appear in NFL, NBA and NHL form. At Long Last, TV Sans the Commercials 
</P>
<P>
 Television addicts will cheer Commercial Brake, a nifty little device that 
automatically zaps commercials from programs or movies recorded on a VCR. It's 
due on the market in early September. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since remote-controlled TVs and VCRs were invented, viewers have zapped 
and zipped through commercials from recorded programs. Film buffs trying to 
archive old movies have done the same. But that requires patience and a quick 
trigger finger on the fast-forward button. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Encino inventor Jerry Iggulden has a way to eliminate commercials for 
you. The Commercial Brake box easily connects to your VCR with cables, Iggulden 
says. It makes a "playback map" of where the commercials are while the program 
is being recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through sophisticated electronics, it watches while the recording is being 
made and can tell where the commercials took place," he explains. "Then when 
the program is played back, the screen goes to blue for five seconds and zips 
through the commercial." The audio is muted as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Iggulden owns the technology with Arthur D. Little Enterprises Inc. of 
Cambridge, Mass., a company that helps inventors commercialize their ideas. By 
next spring, Iggulden expects his technology to be built into several 
brand-name VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial Brake ($200) is being produced by Arista Technologies Inc. in 
Hauppauge, N.Y. To find stores in your area that sell it, call (800) 5-ARISTA.

SOME REAL TURN-ONS; IF YOU TAKE A DIM VIEW OF THE AVERAGE BULB, FLUORESCENTS 
MAY PUT THINGS IN A NEW LIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY LIBMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With their awkward shapes and unflatteringly harsh light, for decades 
fluorescent lights paled in com parison to incandescent bulbs for most 
home-lighting needs. 
</P>
<P>
 But compact fluorescents, introduced into the U.S. market in the early 1980s, 
may be worth another look. 
</P>
<P>
 These lamps are shorter than traditional fluorescent tubes, fit into smaller 
spaces and give a warmer, incandescent-like glow, says Gregory B. Sharp, a 
specialist in residential technology at Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 They also use about a quarter of the energy to produce the same light as 
incandescents. (A 20-watt compact fluorescent produces as much light as a 
75-watt incandescent.) And they last about 10,000 hours -- much longer than 
incandescents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the life of the compact fluorescent lamp, you'd go through at least 12 
to 14 incandescent replacements," Sharp says. "(Each) compact fluorescent will 
save you $30 to $35 based on the cost of bulbs and energy -- using Edison's 
residential rate." 
</P>
<P>
 The lights are best used in "areas that you need to light most -- such as the 
kitchen or living room -- because the pay back is shorter," Sharp says. "If you 
have a little closet light that you rarely turn on, a standard incandescent 
would be recommended." 
</P>
<P>
 One drawback to compact fluorescents is the retail price of $16 to $20 apiece, 
which makes them too expensive for many stores to carry. They're usually 
available in large building-supply outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 The light also may come on slowly. "When the lamp comes on, it needs to heat 
up to produce a full amount of light," says Fred Berryman of the California 
Energy Commission. Some older lamps blinked when switched on, but new ones 
start as fast as incandescents or within a second. 
</P>
<P>
 Compact fluorescents come in screw-in or plug-in versions. The plug-in lamp is 
cheaper to replace because the ballast required to start and control its output 
is in the fixture, not the lamp. Some ballasts for plug-in lamps are part of 
the fixture; others can be replaced separately. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as compact fluorescents have won converts, so has another newer light 
source, halogen bulbs. These produce about 10% to 20% more light than 
incandescents by creating a higher filament temperature. They also last about 
twice as long -- 1,500 to 2,000 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 So while they're more efficient than incandescents, they're less efficient 
than fluorescents. "They're also not necessarily a better value economically 
because purchase prices range from $3 to $12," Sharp says.  
</P>
<P>
 But the lights can produce nice effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people like the mood they can give," Sharp says. "They will also 
accurately portray colors and focus a beam of light into a small area, so they 
are effective accenting something or lighting artifacts. And they work well 
with dimming systems." 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional incandescent light -- which works by driving current through a 
tungsten filament thinner than a human hair -- also has advantages. The bulbs 
are relatively cheap to buy, give good color rendition and are versatile enough 
for most household uses, Sharp says. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have a shorter life than other light sources and require more energy. 
</P>
<P>
 In one area vital to many people -- putting on makeup -- fluorescents are 
superior, experts say. A full-spectrum fluorescent is most effective in 
applying makeup, while a soft pink is most flattering once the covering is 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "The full spectrum is as close to daylight as you're going to get," says 
Jessica Vitti, manager and vice president of Aida Grey, a Beverly Hills 
institute of beauty. "It doesn't give you shadows and tells you exactly what 
your skin is going to look like in the light. 
</P>
<P>
 "The soft pink brings out the natural color of the skin. It makes everyone 
look good. You don't want anything with blue in it. It's almost a hospital kind 
of lighting where you look very pale." 
</P>
<P>
 At one time fluorescents were considered too unflattering to use in many areas 
of the home because they appeared white or almost blue, says Michael 
Siminovitch, who has researched compact fluorescents for six years at the 
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 But new phosphors -- powders on the inside of the glass tube -- give a warm, 
incandescent-like appearance more suitable to the home, the scientist says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lighting designer Paulie Jenkins adds that people with darker complexions 
might try using different shades of light. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very black people sometimes have almost a blue tint and a lavender 
(fluorescent light) will make their skin look good," says Jenkins, who has 
created lighting for almost 300 shows worldwide. "But if you have a black 
person who has more of a brown or yellow cast to the skin, you need to go more 
into ambers." 
</P>
<P>
 "For someone with an olive-toned skin, you might use pale amber. I'd stay away 
from pink. That turns the skin gray," says Jenkins, who has worked on such 
shows as "A Little Night Music" at the Doolittle Theater and "In the Belly of 
the Beast" at the Mark Taper Forum.  
</P>
<P>
 In many outdoor situations, halogen lamps may be effective. These lights, 
which resemble head lamps in a car, bounce light off a reflector, creating a 
beam that can light a specific area, Sharp says. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet compact fluorescents would also be a good selection for outdoor lamps that 
will be left on a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you need to light up an outdoor area for security," Berryman says, "these 
are . . . longer lived than incandescents, and they run three to five times 
more light per watt, so they are significantly more efficient."

PRESENTING YOURSELF IN THE BEST POSSIBLE LIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY LIBMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here are some home-lighting recommendations from Fred Berryman, a lighting 
specialist since 1978 at the California Energy Commission in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitchen: The best combination is smaller general ceiling lights with compact 
fluorescents over work areas such as the sink. Separate switches allow you to 
turn on only the lights you need for each situation. Warning: Incandescent 
lights recessed in the ceiling waste energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bathrooms: The recommendation is similar to kitchens. Because new California 
building codes require fluorescents in bathrooms and kitchens, the market has 
produced attractive full-sized and compact fluorescents.  
</P>
<P>
 Hallways: A ceiling-mounted compact fluorescent can spread light on hallway 
walls, providing a cheerful environment.  
</P>
<P>
 Family room/office: Consider cove lighting -- lights mounted on the wall or 
near the ceiling behind decorative shields -- to spread light evenly over the 
ceiling without glare. The inside of the shield should be highly reflective. 
Caution: Fluorescents are efficient, so avoid using too much light. Another 
strategy is to put several smaller lights in the cove and use a couple of 
switches to turn on several levels of lighting, which also serves as an 
inexpensive approach to dimming. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedroom: Bedrooms in new homes often have no overhead lighting -- only 
switch-operated wall outlets. If you want overhead lights, consider cove 
lighting. But make sure you're not making your bedroom as bright as an office. 
</P>
<P>
 Living room/dining room: Fluorescents in a cove may produce indirect light on 
a wall behind the couch or off the ceiling. You'd also want some table lamps 
and task lighting, such as reading lamps. To spotlight art work, use 
low-voltage halogen spotlights. Avoid energy-inefficient halogen torchiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the house: Consider controls and switches. In areas of infrequent 
use where children may leave lights on, sensors can turn off lights in timed 
intervals after someone leaves the space. Also, low voltage control systems 
with master panels allow you to shut off all the lights in the house by pushing 
one button when you leave in the morning. GARY LIBMAN

R S V P / INTO THE NIGHT: HARRISON FORD MAKES THE PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Scene: Wednesday's benefit West Coast premiere of Paramount's "Clear and 
Present Danger." Both the screening and outdoor after-party were on the 
studio's lot. The big draw of the evening was star Harrison Ford, who said, 
"Frankly, I'd rather be home milking the cow. But I'm pleased to be able to 
bring people's attention to the movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Ford; co-stars Joaquim de Almeida, Henry Czerny and Ann 
Magnuson; director Phillip Noyce; producer Mace Neufeld; plus 900 guests, 
including Tom Arnold, Alan Ladd Jr., Buzz and Lois Aldrin, William Friedkin, 
Ron Meyer, Rob Friedman, Sid Ganis and Paramount execs Sherry Lansing, Jonathan 
Dolgen and Barry London. 
</P>
<P>
 Buzz: Among the filmmakers there was pleasure with the good reviews. "It's 
better than a slap in the belly with a wet fish," was the way Ford put it. 
Among the guests there was the arcane art of estimating success. "It'll do $100 
million on inertia alone," said one. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Act of Self-Defense: Screenwriter John Milius' wife, Elan Oberon, brought 
her own heavy-duty, gun-range-style ear protectors, which she wore through much 
of the screening. "It's too loud," she said. "It hurts my ears." On the other 
hand, Milius said his hearing has been so damaged by proximity to guns and 
explosions that "I can't hear what people are saying to me at parties. I find 
myself just agreeing with whatever they say." 
</P>
<P>
 Dress Mode: According to one fashion expert, what was stylish were T-shirts 
worn under sleeveless dresses, skirts with suspenders worn over T-shirts, and 
vests worn over T-shirts. Passe were "rayon floral nostalgia dresses. But the 
way to update them is to wear them over a T-shirt." 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: Ford on the Jack Ryan persona: "I think it's important when you play a 
character who does extraordinary things to allow the audience to see some 
aspect of the character that is like themselves. So you can help create an 
emotional continuity between the character and the audience. So they feel they 
have a representative and it's not just a story about someone who has nothing 
to do with their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: Tickets were $300; more than $300,000 was netted for Stop 
Cancer. "Every penny of this goes to fund research," said Paramount's Lansing, 
who co-chaired the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastimes: Noyce spent the day at half a dozen theaters watching the film with 
the public. He slipped away from the screening to do the same thing. "I've seen 
it before with indoctrinated audiences," the director said. "Now I want to see 
it with the guy who values the $7 he paid."

 Houghton Mifflin Co. announced that it would fold its Ticknor & Fields 
imprint, and Harcourt Brace & Co. laid off a dozen editorial staffers in a 
sharp reduction of its adult trade division. While taking over rival publisher 
Macmillan Inc. in a $553-million deal, Simon & Schuster closed the newly 
acquired Atheneum imprint and said it would put out fewer books under the 
Macmillan name. 
</P>
<P>
 These corporate pullbacks, coupled with the earlier closings of quality units 
such as Summit Books, have prompted debates about whether serious books have 
been eclipsed by the kind of commercial sure shots written by Tom Clancy and 
John Grisham. 
</P>
<P>
 Those discussions likely will continue. Meanwhile, leading publishers are 
developing other outlets. These new subsidiaries may not share the literary 
pedigree of the ones closed down, but they are fresh attempts to market books 
in a competitive environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in publishing are going to be every bit as aggressive in acquiring 
books," said Leigh Haber, vice president and associate publisher of Scribners, 
"but they may be exercising the kind of wisdom and pragmatism that did not 
exist in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the latest developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * The mighty Simon & Schuster next year plans to start a line of fiction in 
the larger, trade-paperback format. Although details have yet to be announced, 
titles in the new Scribner line (not to be confused with S&S' Scribners 
hardcovers) are expected to come from a variety of sources, including S&S and 
the Macmillan back list. 
</P>
<P>
 * Riverhead is a new line of nonfiction being developed at the Putnam Berkley 
Group Inc. by Susan J. Petersen, who became executive vice president in 
November after a long stretch at Random House. 
</P>
<P>
 * Putnam Berkley also is launching Boulevard, a new imprint of fiction and 
nonfiction, both in hardcover and paperback, based on popular entertainment and 
media personalities. The first of about 48 titles a year to bear the Boulevard 
imprint, beginning in June, will include Diane Duane's "The Venom Factor," a 
novel dealing with the Spiderman comic-strip character, and Kevin Anderson's 
"Young Jedi Knights," a story inspired by the "Star Wars" movies. Rap poet Dana 
Bryant's "Song of the Sirens" is also on the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 * Harvest Books, a trade-paperback division of Harcourt Brace based in San 
Diego, is increasing its output (now about 60 books a year) and placing greater 
emphasis on Harvest originals. For example, Harvest's fall list includes John 
Loveday's "Halo," a poetic first novel of the Old West published to great 
acclaim in Britain two years ago, and another British import, Lloyd Jones' 
"Biografi," a rare travelogue of long-isolated Albania. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kodansha America, a branch of Japan's leading publisher, has released the 
first titles in its Kodansha Globe line of nonfiction trade paperbacks, which 
will number 24 a year. The early offerings include Ted Kerasote's "Bloodties: 
Nature, Culture, and the Hunt" and George Condominas' "We Have Eaten the 
Forest," an account of a Montagnard village in Vietnam. Both had been published 
previously in hardcover outside Kodansha. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Ballantine Publishing Group is adding Moorings, newly established in 
Nashville, Tenn., to its array of imprints. Starting next year, Moorings plans 
to publish up to 30 titles annually for the expanding Christian and 
inspirational market. 
</P>
<P>
 * St. Martin's Press is preparing to establish a line of literary hardcovers 
and trade paperbacks under the Picador banner, a name long associated with 
quality publishing in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Most readers probably do not care which companies publish the books they plan 
to buy. Indeed, industry cynics snicker that the latest start-ups are little 
more than flag-waving gimmicks designed to enliven sales reps' pitches to their 
bookselling customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, plans at Penguin USA to launch a new division specializing in books 
about intellectual and social issues have not survived the death of Erwin A. 
Glikes in the spring. Glikes, former publisher of the Free Press, was joining 
Penguin to develop the imprint. 
</P>
<P>
 "Erwin wanted to create it for us and it doesn't exist without him," Peter 
Mayer, chief executive of the Penguin Group, said this week.  
</P>

 On the Racks: If the ground rumbles Aug. 17, it may be because an estimated 2 
million copies of Tom Clancy's new yarn, "Debt of Honor" (Putnam), are 
scheduled to be laid down in stores. The novel, which received a rave in last 
week's Publishers Weekly, puts hero Jack Ryan in a war of wills set off by what 
the reviewer calls "a power-hungry Japanese financier." 
</P>
<P>
 Laurence Leamer's "The Kennedy Women: The Saga of an American Family," newly 
published by Villard Books, checks in at 935 pages and a list price of $27.50, 
and weighs a hefty 3 pounds, 2.5 ounces with its jacket on. Though an 
unauthorized report, Leamer's book is based, among other sources, on his rare 
interviews with three of President John F. Kennedy's surviving sisters, as well 
as with the nuns who care for Rosemary Kennedy, a resident of a Wisconsin home 
for the mentally retarded since 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 Also: An unusual book about the late Jacqueline Onassis is on the spring 
schedule of Farrar, Straus. Wayne Koestenbaum, a poet and cultural critic whose 
"The Queen's Throat" was a bestseller last year, is writing an interpretation 
of Jackie the icon. 
</P>

 Afterwords: Spy has returned to newsstands looking and reading like the 
satirical magazine of old except for one glaring omission: no fresh dish from 
Celia Brady. You remember Brady, a pseudonym for the impressively plugged-in 
person (or persons) who wrote "The Industry" column about Hollywood deals and 
boorish behavior in the movie biz. Will Celia return? We certainly hope so. 
"Everything is still developing," Spy Editor James Mauro says. "I can't really 
talk about it." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 To celebrate the imminent publication of Alison Lurie's "Women and Ghosts," a 
collection of spooky tales, the publisher Nan A. Talese / Doubleday will offer 
$500 to the writer of the best unpublished ghost story that it receives. Lurie 
herself will judge double-spaced, typed entries of no more than 6,000 words 
sent by Oct. 31 to: Write an Original Ghost Story Contest, 1540 Broadway, 18th 
Floor, New York, N.Y. 10036.

TACO BELL FIRES FOOTE CONE, SPLITS ACCOUNT; ADVERTISING: TWO AGENCIES WILL PLAN 
NEW CAMPAIGN FOR O.C.-BASED FAST-FOOD CHAIN, RE-EMPHASIZING ITS VALUE MENU. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Taco Bell Corp. has ended its six-year relationship with the agency that gave 
it the "Run for the Border" campaign and is dividing its $150-million annual 
advertising budget between Dallas-based Richards Group and the New York and 
Orange County offices of Bozell Jacobs Kenyan and Eckard. 
</P>
<P>
 In leaving Foote Cone & Belding, which developed Taco Bell's youth-oriented 
advertising and its "border" campaigns, Taco Bell appears to be changing its 
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you'll see is a sort of 'back to the future' for us, a refocus on 
value," said Blaise Mercadante, vice president of marketing services. (PepsiCo, 
the Mexican-style food chain's parent company, was a merchandising sponsor of 
the "Back to the Future" movies, and its products were featured in the films.) 
"The new campaign will build on value (in) new, exciting ways," Mercadante 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based Taco Bell has promoted a so-called value menu since 1988, when 
Foote Cone was signed to the advertising account, but the fast-food chain's 
officials apparently felt that the low-price message has been downplayed in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to change the rules again and keep our competitors following our 
lead," Kenneth T. Stevens, Taco Bell's new president, said in July, when he 
announced that the ad campaign was up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Foote Cone's San Francisco office, which handled the Taco Bell 
account, could not be reached for comment. The office recently laid off two top 
creative executives after losing the $30-million Pacific Bell account, and 
although it has replaced the phone company with the same-sized E&J Gallo 
varietal wine account, industry journal AdWeek magazine recently suggested that 
more layoffs could follow if Taco Bell bolted. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Taco Bell gave competing agencies only a month to come up with pitches 
for the account, Mercadante said, Bozell and Richards have not yet created a 
campaign. "That's what we'll be spending the next few months on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both agencies have experience in restaurant advertising. Bozell has done work 
for another PepsiCo subsidiary, Pizza Hut, and currently handles the $6-million 
annual account for Taco Bell's Hot 'n Now drive-through hamburger chain. 
Richards handles several restaurants, including the TGIFriday's chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards Group also devised the popular "we'll keep a light on for you" 
campaign for Motel 6 that features the homey voice of essayist Tom Bodett. 
</P>
<P>
 Bozell, with $1.5 billion in annual billings as of May, includes Chrysler 
Corp., JC Penney & Co. and Merrill Lynch & Co. among its clients. 
</P>
<P>
 PepsiCo reportedly is concerned about lagging profits in its restaurant 
divisions -- Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC, operator of the Kentucky Fried 
Chicken chain. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second quarter, weaker-than-expected profits from the restaurant 
operations helped depress PepsiCo's results. 
</P>
<P>
 At Taco Bell, operating profit fell 5% to $54.6 million from $57.4 million 
even as revenue jumped 19% to $761.7 million. The company, which posted $3.9 
billion in revenue for 1993, says it expects continued worldwide growth to push 
its sales to $20 billion a year by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its 4,500 Taco Bell fast food restaurants, the company owns 
Chevys Restaurants, a 48-unit chain of traditional full-service restaurants 
specializing in "Tex-Mex" food; and the 200-unit Hot 'n Now hamburger chain.

SHOPTALK PAYS OFF; MULTILINGUAL COURSE HELPS RIOT VICTIMS

 Pang Kim still remembers clearly the day the interior decorations store he 
built with his wife, Hye, was destroyed in the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was completely burned," Kim said of his original Living Art store 
in Koreatown, which was 2 1/2 blocks from its present location. "My wife 
started crying. I had a helpless feeling. Ten years of effort were in there, 
and they were all gone." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kims were eager to rebuild, they said, but they felt disoriented and 
vulnerable -- until they enrolled in a business course aimed at helping 
Koreatown merchants rebuild after the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Pang Kim says, their business, which makes the bedding Korean newlyweds 
traditionally give their in-laws, is stronger than ever. "No one can break my 
business, because I have a good foundation with that knowledge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, in a ceremony at the Harvard Grand Hotel in Koreatown, the Kims will 
be part of the 70-member first graduating class of the 13-week multilingual 
business program. The program is sponsored by the Alliance for Neighborhood 
Economic Development, a unit of the Korean Youth and Community Center, and the 
Entrepreneurial Training Program at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is a small but important part of a $1.6-million effort by the city 
of Los Angeles to teach 1,200 people the basics of running a small business in 
the wake of the rioting that destroyed more than 10,000 firms and caused $1 
billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has really been articulated in community meetings is the need for 
providing ownership opportunities of local businesses to local residents," said 
Marilyn Lurie, a director in the city's community development department. 
</P>
<P>
 Also among the 70 students -- most of them Korean Americans or Latinos -- are 
former grocery and convenience store owners who have opened self-service 
laundries, restaurants, an indoor swap meet and a store that sells dehydrated 
fruit. 
</P>
<P>

 Juan Zamora lost everything when his shoe-making business was looted and 
burned. He has since opened a larger store, Calzado Don Juan ("Footwear by Mr. 
Juan") and employs five people who make leather shoes, wallets, belts and other 
items. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora credits his business class, which was taught in Spanish, with giving 
him the know-how to build a solid foundation for the second time around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm planning to make my business bigger than before," Zamora said. "The class 
reinforced that. I have more confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the students had little, if any, formal business training, almost all 
had years of experience running mom-and-pop stores in Koreatown, Pico-Union and 
South-Central Los Angeles, said Patrice Wong, director of the Alliance for 
Neighborhood Economic Development. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people know how to run their businesses. Most of them had operated a 
business for over a decade," said Sun Chung, a public accountant who taught 45 
students in Korean and English. "It's just that the riots happened and they 
lost their whole business. We taught them how to rebuild and protect their 
businesses so that nothing like this will ever happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 The classes met once a week and used a USC-designed curriculum that focuses on 
basics such as marketing, accounting, employee management and legal 
considerations. Special emphasis was given to doing business in a multicultural 
community, Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 When they finished the classes, students wrote business plans to help them 
secure financing through alternative loan programs in the community, Wong said. 
Twenty students have finished their business plans so far, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus Arguelles, a management consultant who taught business classes in 
Spanish and English, said this is the first time the entrepreneurial courses 
have been taught in languages other than English. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are making history," Arguelles said. "A lot of the thriving smaller 
businesses in Southern California are not English-speaking," but they are 
making money and creating jobs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the riots, the Korean neighborhood development group sought assistance 
from the USC Business Expansion Network, which helps the small-business 
community and provides entrepreneurial training, to help Koreatown merchants 
rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we were cooperating with them, together we identified this need for 
additional entrepreneurial training and looked at how we could solve the 
problem together," said Debbie Esparza, executive director of the USC Business 
Expansion Network. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong and Esparza secured funding from Los Angeles city and county agencies, 
found bilingual instructors and offered the class free to riot victims in 
Koreatown -- which is about half Latino -- and neighboring communities. More 
classes will be offered in September, as soon as new textbooks can be printed, 
Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the key to the program's success is the instruction in students' 
native languages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes concepts and words in English are difficult to explain in English 
-- things like amortization or depreciation, " Wong said. "One woman in our 
Asian class who has very limited English-speaking skills went through a program 
in English and maybe understood a tenth of it. When she went through our class 
with the Korean (instruction), things really started to jell." 
</P>
<P>
 Locke Yut, Harry Tse and Katherine Wong decided to take the business course 
after their plans to reopen the grocery store they ran for almost 30 years were 
thwarted. Instead, they opened a coin laundry in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they plan to open more. Because of the class, "we know exactly what to 
look for, how to negotiate with other people and how to build the business," 
Yut said. Having written a business plan "makes you a lot more confident to 
know exactly what you're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Vaquerano wrote a business plan for a public relations firm that would 
specialize in serving the Central American community in Los Angeles. During the 
course, he told his classmates he would one day write press releases about the 
very companies they are now working to build. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to the graduation ceremony," Vaquerano said. "We all 
worked very hard. Getting the certificate, you know, it says you have been able 
to achieve a goal."

CHINESE COURT UPHOLDS WALT DISNEY CO. COPYRIGHT; RULING: SIZE OF PENALTY IS 
SEEN AS A TEST OF COMMITMENT TO CRACK DOWN ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PIRACY. 
</P>

<P>
 For the first time, a Chinese court has recognized a U.S. company's copyright, 
taking a critical step toward what experts say could be general protection for 
foreign goods and ideas in China. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ruling Wednesday, the court agreed with Burbank-based Walt Disney Co. 
that a Chinese publisher and its distributor had pirated children's books 
bearing a Mickey Mouse logo and based on Disney's animated films. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first copyright violation case brought by a U.S. company that went 
to trial in a court in China, a hotbed of intellectual property piracy that 
costs U.S. companies hundreds of millions of dollars annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the decision could be significant for U.S. companies if it signals 
China's intentions to adhere to international standards on patent, trademark 
and copyright protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "This looks to be a significant development in that courts and governmental 
authorities in that part of the world now appear to be showing greater respect 
for the intellectual property of U.S. companies," said Gary Reback, head of the 
intellectual property practice at the Palo Alto law firm Wilson, Sonsini, 
Goodrich & Rosati. 
</P>
<P>
 China has been under pressure from the United States to crack down on 
companies that illegally copy U.S. companies' ideas and goods, especially in 
technology, software, publishing, films and recordings. On June 30, U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor placed China on the U.S. government's "Super 301" 
list of countries believed to tolerate intellectual property piracy and began a 
six-month investigation of theft accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the 301 regulations, if China fails to resolve the U.S. complaints, it 
could face trade sanctions equal to the amount of losses the U.S. companies 
attribute to such piracy. In 1993, Kantor's office said, those losses were more 
than $800 million in copyright theft alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade office said 94% of computer software in use in China is pirated, and 
the situation in compact and laser discs is reportedly even more egregious. 
CDs, CD-ROMs and laser discs counterfeited in China are now flooding worldwide 
markets, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling by the recently formed intellectual property division of the 
Beijing People's Intermediate Court ended the liability portion of the trial. 
The penalty phase will follow, a Disney official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers say the size of penalties imposed in the Disney case will be a major 
test of China's commitment to its piracy crackdown. U.S. companies have 
complained that in the past when they tried to protect their rights under 
trademark infringement laws, the few penalties imposed by Chinese courts have 
been minuscule. In an earlier Disney case involving trademark infringement, a 
Chinese publisher was fined only $91. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wednesday's ruling, the Beijing court found that books published and 
distributed by Beijing Children's Publishing Press and New China Book Store 
Distribution Center were identical to a series produced earlier by another 
Chinese company under a Disney license that expired in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire Robinson, vice president and counsel at Disney, said the case centered 
on about 300,000 books bearing a Mickey Mouse or Jiminy Cricket logo. The books 
were based on such films as "Snow White," "Cinderella" and "Peter Pan." Disney 
is seeking an injunction against the illegal publishing and distribution of the 
books and penalties equal to profits made by the pirates. That would be less 
than $300,000, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the penalty imposed begins to approach Disney's losses, that would be a 
significant victory for U.S. companies, said Robert Holleyman, president of the 
Business Software Assn. That group, which represents major U.S. software 
makers, has five copyright infringement cases pending in Beijing.

 The South Coast Air Quality Management District -- for years the focus of 
angry complaints from businesses big and small -- on Thursday touted the 
results of a three-year effort to improve the way it regulates industry in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the agency is more business friendly without giving up on our 
environmental goals," said James M. Lents, AQMD executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 And business leaders generally agreed, giving good marks to the district for 
faster permit issuance and greater appreciation of the impact on the regional 
economy of the stiffest clean-air rules in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't heard near the level of moaning and groaning that I heard five 
years ago," said Lloyd Greif, president of Greif & Co., a Los Angeles-based 
investment banking firm with clients that include printing, manufacturing and 
packaging companies. "There is a new climate at the AQMD . . . . and I think 
it's good." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeb Stuart, executive director of the California Manufacturing Assn.'s Air 
Quality Alliance, a group of 35 large manufacturers and utilities in the South 
Coast district, gave much the same assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're much more sensitive to the impact they have on the economy, 
and they need to be," said Stuart, a former chief executive of the AQMD. "We 
also agree that they've done a good job in accelerating permit processing time 
and making the system work better." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even as district officials announced their good news, district switchboard 
operators were fending off yet another, if smaller, wave of complaints -- this 
time from small businesses that have recently received annual bills under a 
state-mandated toxics program that in some cases have jumped by as much as 
450%. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the most part, the district's own programs have settled into more 
efficient routines as personnel have become more experienced and bugs have been 
worked out of the regulatory system. 
</P>
<P>
 A backlog of 26,000 permit applications in 1991 long ago disappeared -- though 
speedier permitting techniques have been aided by a falloff in permit 
applications in the depressed regional economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But district executives have also come up with flexible ways of lowering air 
emissions that are now being copied by air districts as far-flung as Illinois 
and Texas. AQMD Score Card 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a deluge of angry complaints from Southern California businesses 
about its clean-air rules, the South Coast Air Quality Management District set 
out in 1991 to improve its procedures. On Thursday, the district released a 
progress report on its efforts. The highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 Faster Permitting 
</P>
<P>
 * 1991: Backlog of 26,000 equipment permit applications; waiting period 
averages 87 working days. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1994: No backlog; waiting period averages 37 working days; 85% of 
small-business permits issued within seven working days. 
</P>
<P>
 Market Incentives 
</P>
<P>
 * 1991: Inflexible regulations for big companies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1994: A market-based emissions credit-trading system for the 390 largest 
businesses saves $58 million in firms' pollution-control costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Extended Deadlines 
</P>
<P>
 * 1991: Strict rules for screen printers, wood furniture makers and aerospace 
industry that would have resulted in coatings -- water-based, not oil-based -- 
inferior to those of out-of-state competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1994: Rule deadlines have been postponed until new coatings meet industry 
quality standards.GOVERNMENT REGULATION

QVC BOARD APPROVES $1.42-BILLION TAKEOVER; MERGER: UNABLE TO ATTRACT A BETTER 
OFFER, THE SHOPPING CHANNEL ACCEPTS A SLIGHTLY SWEETER COMCAST AND LIBERTY 
MEDIA BID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Unable to attract a better offer from another party, directors of QVC Inc. on 
Thursday accepted a slightly sweetened $1.42-billion takeover bid from its two 
largest shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Comcast Corp. and Liberty Media Corp. are expected to launch their tender 
offer for all outstanding QVC shares within five days, offering $46 per share 
instead of their original $44 for each of the 63% of QVC shares they don't 
already own. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote signals the effective end of QVC Chairman Barry Diller's era at the 
home shopping network, although he will remain until December to oversee a 
transition, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diller had tried hard to drum up a rival bid to fetch a higher price for the 
company, but none materialized, even though, sources said, regional phone 
companies BellSouth, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech each considered such a move. 
</P>
<P>
 "The process has now been completed, and maximum value has been obtained for 
the shareholders," Diller said in a prepared statement. "I had committed to 
make that the sole focus of my attention, and if and when the merger is 
consummated, I will do my best to provide for a perfect transition." 
</P>
<P>
 Said one source in the QVC camp: "We had no third-party bid, and we had no 
internal plan that would create great value." 
</P>
<P>
 The source acknowledged that the idea of a massive stock repurchase was 
unappealing to Diller because it would have burdened the company with debt and 
restricted its activities to retailing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many Wall Street sources said QVC might be worth $50 per share, most 
said they knew a bidding war was unlikely once Liberty Media threw its weight 
behind Comcast. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the two largest shareholders decide that's all they're going to pay, 
that's it," said one analyst, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Diller had always intended to use QVC as a launching pad for grander things. 
When his bid for Paramount Communications Inc. failed in February, he proposed 
a sale of the company to CBS Inc., which would have placed him at the helm of 
the combined companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The CBS deal was torpedoed, however, by Comcast's surprise bid last month to 
buy QVC. That bid was joined later by Liberty Media, another large shareholder 
that is being reacquired by cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was over weeks ago," declared one securities analyst who follows all three 
companies. "The only interesting thing is where (Diller) is going to bounce to 
next. I think he will go on vacation for a couple of weeks, and then after 
Labor Day the rumors will start up again. If it moves, it's got Barry there!" 
</P>
<P>
 In his 18 months there, Diller drew unprecedented attention to the home 
shopping network by luring high-profile visitors to its West Chester, Pa., 
headquarters and spinning visions of an interactive future. 
</P>
<P>
 Just six months into the job, Diller proposed a merger with chief rival Home 
Shopping Network in a stock swap that would have been worth $1.4 billion. But 
the merger was questioned seriously by federal antitrust regulators, and the 
proposal was scrapped after Diller bid for Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of May, Diller controlled about 9% of QVC's stock and still had a 
voting partnership with Comcast. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, however, he did not have sufficient clout to override the wishes 
-- and financial resources -- of that founding shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Diller will walk away with $118 million for his QVC stint. In addition 
to his initial investment in the company, he received a signing bonus of 
$5-million worth of QVC stock and options for an additional 6 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 As previously agreed, Comcast will own 57% of the company and have management 
control, and Liberty Media will hold 43%. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweetened bid added about $70 million to the purchase price. The total 
cost of the acquisition includes $90 million for the cost of canceling stock 
options and completing the transaction, a Comcast executive said. 
</P>
<P>
 In trading Thursday, QVC shares rose 75 cents to $44.75, while Comcast slipped 
25 cents to $15.625. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberty Media rose 25 cents to $23, while Tele-Communications Inc. rose 12.5 
cents to $23. It was a hectic day for Liberty, which held a shareholder meeting 
Thursday in Denver to approve a plan to merge with TCI, the nation's largest 
cable TV operator that spun off Liberty just three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Liberty and Comcast attorneys were still ironing out details of 
their bid and would not put out a formal announcement until Friday.

LEARNING BUSINESS' LANGUAGES; MULTILINGUAL USC COURSE HELPS RIOT VICTIMS 
REBUILD

 Pang Kim still remembers clearly the day the interior decorations store he 
built with his wife, Hye, was destroyed in the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was completely burned," Kim said of his original Living Art store 
in Koreatown, which was 2 1/2 blocks from its present location. "My wife 
started crying. I had a helpless feeling. Ten years of effort were in there, 
and they were all gone." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kims were eager to rebuild, they said, but they felt disoriented and 
vulnerable -- until they enrolled in a business course aimed at helping 
Koreatown merchants rebuild after the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Pang Kim says, their business, which makes the bedding Korean newlyweds 
traditionally give their in-laws, is stronger than ever. "No one can break my 
business, because I have a good foundation with that knowledge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, in a ceremony at the Harvard Grand Hotel in Koreatown, the Kims will 
be part of the 70-member first graduating class of the 13-week multilingual 
business program. The program is sponsored by the Alliance for Neighborhood 
Economic Development, a unit of the Korean Youth and Community Center, and the 
Entrepreneurial Training Program at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is a small but important part of a $1.6-million effort by the city 
of Los Angeles to teach 1,200 people the basics of running a small business in 
the wake of the rioting that destroyed more than 10,000 firms and caused $1 
billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has really been articulated in community meetings is the need for 
providing ownership opportunities of local businesses to local residents," said 
Marilyn Lurie, a director in the city's community development department. 
</P>
<P>
 Also among the 70 students -- most of them Korean Americans or Latinos -- are 
former grocery and convenience store owners who have opened self-service 
laundries, restaurants, an indoor swap meet and a store that sells dehydrated 
fruit. 
</P>
<P>

 Juan Zamora lost everything when his shoe-making business was looted and 
burned. He has since opened a larger store, Calzado Don Juan ("Footwear by Mr. 
Juan") and employs five people who make leather shoes, wallets, belts and other 
items. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora credits his business class, which was taught in Spanish, with giving 
him the know-how to build a solid foundation for the second time around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm planning to make my business bigger than before," Zamora said. "The class 
reinforced that. I have more confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the students had little, if any, formal business training, almost all 
had years of experience running mom-and-pop stores in Koreatown, Pico-Union and 
South-Central Los Angeles, said Patrice Wong, director of the Alliance for 
Neighborhood Economic Development. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people know how to run their businesses. Most of them had operated a 
business for over a decade," said Sun Chung, a public accountant who taught 45 
students in Korean and English. "It's just that the riots happened and they 
lost their whole business. We taught them how to rebuild and protect their 
businesses so that nothing like this will ever happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 The classes met once a week and used a USC-designed curriculum that focuses on 
basics such as marketing, accounting, employee management and legal 
considerations. Special emphasis was given to doing business in a multicultural 
community, Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 When they finished the classes, students wrote business plans to help them 
secure financing through alternative loan programs in the community, Wong said. 
Twenty students have finished their business plans so far, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus Arguelles, a management consultant who taught business classes in 
Spanish and English, said this is the first time the entrepreneurial courses 
have been taught in languages other than English. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are making history," Arguelles said. "A lot of the thriving smaller 
businesses in Southern California are not English-speaking," but they are 
making money and creating jobs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the riots, the Korean neighborhood development group sought assistance 
from the USC Business Expansion Network, which helps the small-business 
community and provides entrepreneurial training, to help Koreatown merchants 
rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we were cooperating with them, together we identified this need for 
additional entrepreneurial training and looked at how we could solve the 
problem together," said Debbie Esparza, executive director of the USC Business 
Expansion Network. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong and Esparza secured funding from Los Angeles city and county agencies, 
found bilingual instructors and offered the class free to riot victims in 
Koreatown -- which is about half Latino -- and neighboring communities. More 
classes will be offered in September, as soon as new textbooks can be printed, 
Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the key to the program's success is the instruction in students' 
native languages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes concepts and words in English are difficult to explain in English 
-- things like amortization or depreciation, " Wong said. "One woman in our 
Asian class who has very limited English-speaking skills went through a program 
in English and maybe understood a tenth of it. When she went through our class 
with the Korean (instruction), things really started to jell."

TELECOMMUNICATIONS BILL FACES EXTINCTION IN SENATE; CONGRESS: MEASURE 
LANGUISHES DUE TO BITTER DEBATE BETWEEN BABY BELLS AND SEN. ERNEST HOLLINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Telecommunications reform -- which the Clinton Administration says can deliver 
1.4 million new jobs and a $100-billion economic boost over the next decade -- 
appears to be in jeopardy as time runs short on a measure aimed at spurring 
competition among cable operators, phone companies and long-distance carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 A sweeping telecommunications bill that supporters say would lower phone bills 
and bring advanced new Information Age services to consumers and businesses is 
languishing in the Senate due to a bitter clash between the seven regional Bell 
phone companies and Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), the powerful chairman of 
the Senate Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the House last month passed a similar bill by an overwhelming 423-5 
vote, the Senate version faces extinction due to an impasse over the highly 
contentious issue of allowing the regional Bell telephone companies into the 
long-distance telephone business. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers, lobbyists and consumer groups remain engaged in a furious scramble 
to broker a deal before Congress recesses this month. The Senate calendar 
dictates that a compromise must be reached by Tuesday at the latest, Senate 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those involved in the negotiations expressed optimism that a meeting 
scheduled for today could resolve the remaining issues. But BellSouth Corp. 
Vice President R.L. Mickey McGuire, in a draft memo circulated Thursday, said 
the sides remain at odds on the preconditions to the Bells providing 
long-distance service and whether they must form a separate unit to market such 
service, among other issues. McGuire also said in the memo that telephone rate 
regulation and issues concerning the terms of competition between telephone and 
cable companies have not been fully resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are down to the final hours unless there is an agreement on new language," 
Bill McCloskey, a spokesman for the Baby Bells' task force, said before the 
Wednesday meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes are high for the nation as well as the Clinton Administration. In a 
recent briefing paper produced by the President's Council of Economic Advisers, 
officials say legislative reform of the $300-billion telecommunications 
industry would boost America's global competitiveness and produce 1.4 million 
jobs by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapid convergence of television, computers and telephones promises to 
transform the way Americans live, work and communicate, the council said. The 
high expectations for such an electronic network were dramatized last month in 
the federal government's first auction of the airwaves, when investor 
enthusiasm drove bids to a startling total of $833 million for licenses to 
offer new wireless communications services. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But on Capitol Hill, telecom reform has been eclipsed by the health care 
debate, and it lacks the high-profile White House support that the North 
American Free Trade Agreement enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a significant setback if" reform legislation did not pass this 
year, acknowledged the White House's chief telecommunications czar, Assistant 
Commerce Secretary Larry Irving. "We are still optimistic he (Hollings) is 
going to push a bill through." 
</P>
<P>
 The stalemate over telecommunications reform dates to 1982, when the Justice 
Department broke up AT&T's telephone monopoly and created the seven regional 
Bell companies. The Baby Bells were barred from manufacturing telephone 
equipment or providing long-distance services -- restrictions they've been 
battling ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bells, which share a $100-billion local phone market, are especially eager 
to enter the burgeoning long-distance business. They say they can use the 
revenue to help them invest in the so-called information highway as well as 
offset the cost of providing residential phone service. 
</P>
<P>
 But many lawmakers worry that the Bells would use their monopoly control over 
local telephone service to gain unfair advantage in long-distance. The 
long-distance companies and other Bell opponents say the Bells must not be 
allowed to compete in long-distance until there is true competition in local 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial version of Hollings' bill would have required "actual and 
demonstrable" competition in the local telephone exchange before the regional 
Bell companies could compete in long-distance. A competing bill by Sen. John 
Breaux (D-La.) and Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) would allow local phone companies 
into long-distance one year after the enactment of legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollings recently abandoned the "actual and demonstrable" provision in his 
bill after several Republican Commerce Committee members urged him to 
reconsider. But the Baby Bells have resisted attempts to replace the language 
with some other precondition. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, they have mounted a no-holds-barred lobbying campaign -- 
featuring full-page advertisements in major newspapers -- in which they make 
the curious claim that there is actually no competition in the long-distance 
market, and thus only their entry into the business will bring rates down. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Bells' tactics have infuriated Hollings, who has indicated he won't be 
deterred by warnings that his refusal to give in to the Bells' demands will 
doom legislation again this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American communications system is the envy of the world and I don't want 
to mess it up," Hollings wrote in a July 29 letter to Sen. George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.).

 Arco Cuts Capital Spending: Atlantic Richfield Co. said it will reduce capital 
spending by 36%.The announcement came less than three weeks after the oil 
company said it would cut costs by $400 million annually in a reorganization 
that will eliminate 3,300 jobs. Los Angeles-based Arco is shifting its emphasis 
from Alaska to foreign operations and a new natural gas subsidiary in the Lower 
48 states. It budgeted $9.2 billion for the years 1994 through 1998, compared 
to $14.3 billion from 1989-93. The earlier period included heavy Alaska 
expenses, including disappointing explorations last year in the Beaufort Sea 
and Cook Inlet.

VEGAS WILL GET A TASTE OF THE BIG APPLE; TOURISM: MGM GRAND, PRIMADONNA RESORTS 
TO BUILD $300-MILLION HOTEL-CASINO WITH NEW YORK THEME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 MGM Grand, the creator of the world's largest hotel-casino, and Primadonna 
Resorts, an operator of value-oriented casinos, said Thursday that they will 
build a $300-million hotel-casino in Las Vegas with a New York theme. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,500-room hotel and casino, to be called the New York-New York, is the 
fourth major new project announced this year in Las Vegas. The two companies 
will be equal partners in the venture. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hotel-casino will virtually re-create the best of New York, with themed 
restaurants, a theater and an extensive entertainment center with multiple 
rides and attractions," said Robert Maxey, chief executive of MGM Grand. 
</P>
<P>
 Primadonna spokesman Lance Ignon said the company developed the idea for the 
project and approached MGM Grand with it. 
</P>
<P>
 MGM Grand offered both expertise in large-scale casinos and a prime 18-acre 
site on the Las Vegas Strip. The site is at the intersection that already 
boasts the MGM Grand, Excalibur, Luxor and Tropicana properties. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the primo spot," Ignon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Primm, chief executive of Primadonna, said the property will re-create 
New York's famous skyline and include such landmarks as the Statue of Liberty, 
the Empire State Building, Central Park and Coney Island. It will include a 
water flume ride, motion simulation rides and a roller coaster that will tower 
more than 200 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will serve as a magnet to get more and more people to that end of the 
Strip," said James Murren, a gaming industry analyst with C.J. Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you combine this with the Gold Strike-Mirage deal, the other Mirage 
property and the ITT Desert Kingdom, you have a lineup for '96-97 that will 
bring a lot more people to Las Vegas," Murren said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new projects will lead to a 15% to 20% increase in the number of visitors 
to Las Vegas, which now attracts 25 million visitors a year, a number now 
growing at 8% to 10% a year, Murren said.

KIDDER PROBE SAYS JETT ACTED ALONE; SECURITIES: BUT REPORT ALSO FAULTS 
SUPERVISORS FOR NOT DETECTING THE PHONY-PROFITS SCHEME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 An in-house probe by Kidder, Peabody & Co. blames Joseph Jett, its former 
chief bond trader who was fired in April, as the mastermind and sole culprit in 
a trading scam to create $350 million in phantom profits. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 85-page report, ordered by Kidder parent General Electric Co. and 
released Thursday, says the scheme went undetected for nearly three years 
because of startling lapses in oversight by Kidder supervisors and a breakdown 
in internal Kidder controls. 
</P>
<P>
 The report describes repeated instances when Jett's superiors only glanced at 
his trading records and could have detected the fraud if they had scrutinized 
basic details such as trading dates. 
</P>
<P>
 When the fraud was discovered, the inquiry found, Jett had amassed nearly $90 
billion worth of Treasury securities on Kidder's books, an astounding amount 
nearly equivalent in size to Brazil's foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The inquiry, led by former Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement 
chief Gary Lynch, is the latest attempt by GE and its brokerage unit to contain 
the fallout from the alleged scheme by Jett to create the bogus trading 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidder also said Thursday that it fired one of Jett's former supervisors, 
Melvin Mullin. Mullin, cited in the report for inadequately supervising Jett, 
is the fourth top-level Kidder figure to lose his job in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Kidder said it demoted David Bernstein and Charles Fiumefreddo, 
two fixed-income employees who were temporarily reassigned in April when Jett 
was fired. Four other fixed-income employees reassigned at the time were 
reprimanded and reinstated, the firm said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jett was dismissed April 17 after Kidder accused him of generating the phantom 
bond profits in a trading scheme aimed at hiding about $100 million in trading 
losses. Kidder charged that Jett had also inflated his bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for Jett, Kenneth Warner, vigorously disputed the findings of the 
inquiry. Jett was not interviewed by the probe's investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had Jett's account of what really happened been considered, the conclusions 
of this report would necessarily have been dramatically different," Warner said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Mullin is the latest high-level casualty of the problems at Kidder. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, another Jett supervisor, Edward Cerullo, resigned as chief of 
Kidder's fixed-income division. In addition, GE ousted Michael Carpenter, 
Kidder's chairman and chief executive, and replaced him with two top GE 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Jett, who has denied any wrongdoing, has contended that Cerullo devised the 
bond trading scheme and ordered him to carry it out as part of an effort to 
pare down the firm's assets at the end of each quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the report concludes that Jett's transactions "could not have been 
used to reduce the balance sheet." It rejected Jett's argument that Kidder 
management was aware of and approved of his trading deals.

 Joint Chip Deal Scrapped: Intel Corp. is selling its stake in VLSI Technology 
Inc. as the two companies ended an agreement to jointly develop chips for 
hand-held computers, VLSI said.Under the 1992 agreement, the companies 
developed a chip set called Polar for hand-held computers. While both companies 
will support Polar customers, they have decided that it no longer serves their 
business interests to extend the original agreement, San Jose-based VLSI said. 
Santa Clara-based Intel plans to sell its stake of 5.36 million shares of VLSI, 
which it acquired as part of the technology agreement.

 IBM Cuts Jobs in Storage Division: IBM laid off 320 people in the division, 
which makes devices to store computerized data.It also announced plans to move 
the division's disk drive assembly work from San Jose to Asia, resulting in the 
loss of another 800 jobs by the end of next year. The division will also narrow 
its product focus to a few common technologies, IBM said. The layoffs occurred 
at IBM facilities in San Jose and Rochester, Minn., involving a range of 
administrative, engineering and development personnel. They are part of a 
broader effort to cut about 35,000 jobs this year. Through June 30, IBM had cut 
about 11,000 jobs.

 Unitrin Takeover Bid Gets Costlier: American General Corp. voiced 
disappointment with Unitrin Inc.'s decision to adopt a stockholder rights plan, 
whose purpose is to frustrate its $2.6-billion cash bid for the Chicago-based 
insurer.Unitrin's plan would give stockholders the right to buy extra Unitrin 
shares for each share owned if anybody acquires 15% of the firm's existing 
stock without board approval. The move effectively increases the number of 
Unitrin shares, making any takeover offer more costly. Unitrin rejected last 
month's $2.6-billion offer by American General to buy the company.

 Insured Quake Losses Pass $7-Billion Mark: Property losses from the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake have climbed to $7.2 billion, the American Insurance 
Services Group Inc. said. More than 300,000 claims are expected to be filed 
with insurers, the group said. About 90% of claims have been closed, but the 
percentage has remained relatively constant in recent weeks due to new claim 
submissions.

 Office Vacancy Rate Falls: The figure for U.S. office buildings was the lowest 
since 1985 in the second quarter, as suburban office markets showed stronger 
leasing activity than downtown areas. Nationally, the amount of vacant office 
space stood at 16.3% at the end of the second quarter, down from 18% a year ago 
and a high of 19% in 1992, according to commercial real estate firm CB 
Commercial.The improvement in vacancy rates was led mainly by office properties 
in suburban markets, as technological advances allow tenants to flee urban 
areas. The study, which covers 50 markets across the country, found that the 
vacancy rate for suburban office properties fell about 2.5 percentage points to 
16.1%, the lowest level in at least 10 years.

 House Approves Two Banking Bills: One of the bills repeals decades-old 
restrictions on interstate banking and the other encourages lending in 
distressed communities.The interstate measure, approved on a voice vote, 
dismantles legal barriers dating to the 1920s and is expected to accelerate the 
already-rapid pace of consolidation in the industry. The second bill, passed 
410 to 12, is a watered-down version of one proposed by President Clinton in 
his 1992 election campaign. It authorizes spending $382 million over four years 
to encourage lending in inner cities, poor rural areas and Native American 
reservations. Approval by the Senate, expected within the next two weeks, would 
send the bills to Clinton, who is expected to sign both.

 Kodak May Buy Control of Qualex: The photographic giant is close to reaching 
agreement to pay $220 million for Actava Group Inc.'s half-share in Qualex 
Inc., the companies' photo-finishing joint venture. Eastman Kodak Co., the 
world's largest photographic company, and Actava are completing negotiations 
that could seal an accord within two weeks, sources familiar with the 
transaction said. The purchase of Qualex, the nation's largest wholesale 
film-developing company, with 50 labs in the United States, would be Kodak's 
first venture into developing services since it was freed to do so in a May 
court decision.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: YOUR MONEY; TAKEOVER MANIA -- MOST INVESTORS AREN'T 
BUYING IT 
</P>

 The corporate takeover wave keeps rolling, enriching those investors lucky 
enough to own the stocks of the targets. But for everyone else, this latest 
bout of merger mania is a non-event, or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The non-event is in the stock market as a whole: Despite the busiest takeover 
activity since the late 1980s, Wall Street is getting no collective lift. The 
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, at 458.40 on Thursday, is no higher than it 
was in mid-March, before mergers began to mushroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The "worse" is in stocks of the companies doing the taking over: At least in 
the case of the highest-profile deals of recent months, the acquirers' shares 
generally are lower today than before they made their bids. In some cases, the 
stock declines of the bidders have been dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 What this market reaction suggests is that many investors don't like the 
bidders' choice of targets or the prices paid, or don't see a fast enough or 
high enough payoff from the deals. Or all of the above. 
</P>
<P>
 To be fair to the executives fueling this merger wave, they are thinking 
long-term while many of their shareholders are thinking short-term. As an 
investor, if you fear that your earnings in Company X will be diluted for a 
year or so as it digests Company Y, you may jettison your Company X stock for 
the time being -- even if you agree that the merger is a smart move for the 
long haul. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arbitrage also plays a role in depressing acquiring companies' shares: If a 
deal is a stock swap, Wall Street arbs who buy and hold the target's shares 
until the deal closes frequently "short" the acquiring firm's stock as a hedge. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Wall Street pros say the overt lack of enthusiasm for bidders' stocks 
isn't a good sign. The rising fear is that too many of the corporate buyers are 
overconfident -- and overpaying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a little bit of the 'greater-fool' theory going on now," says 
Scott Black, a principal at $650-million-asset Delphi Capital in Boston. In 
other words, 'I may be a fool for paying $2 billion, but I'd be a greater fool 
to let this opportunity fall into a competitor's hands.' 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, Black views this week's $8.5-billion bid by American Home 
Products for American Cyanamid as extremely rich, at more than 20 times 
Cyanamid's expected 1994 earnings. "I can't see it for a slow-growth company," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, virtually all of today's merger deals are done in the name of 
"synergy": Businesses are buying other businesses they believe are natural fits 
with their own. Cost savings will produce terrific returns for shareholders in 
the long run. Bigger is better. Etc., etc., etc. 
</P>
<P>
 The takeovers of the late 1980s also were justified by a catchy phrase. Then 
-- the era of buy-'em-and-break-'em-up -- buyouts were always done to "realize 
shareholder value." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, in the midst of any mania, expectations begin to far exceed 
realities. "It's probably fair to say that the vast majority of corporate 
acquisitions tend not to earn the kinds of returns that everybody expected them 
to," says Source Capital's George Michaelis, a veteran Los Angeles money 
manager who has witnessed many market cycles come and go. 
</P>
<P>
 David Tripple, manager of the Pioneer II stock fund in Boston, worries that 
the re-emergence of hostile bids (like American Home's) smacks of desperation 
on the part of corporate execs in slow-growing industries. "People with too 
much cash and not enough growth prospects can make the most questionable 
acquisitions," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the question is whether investors can conclude that this takeover wave 
is a certain sign of a market top, Michaelis, Tripple and others say the answer 
is probably not yet. Outside of aggressive bidding for certain assets, 
Michaelis says, "Nothing (else) smacks of late-cycle excesses" in this market. 
The heavy use of debt, for example, is conspicuously absent so far, he notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, it's disturbing that investors by and large can't seem to get excited 
about a takeover rush that Corporate America contends is all about synergy and 
big returns down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 To a significant degree, the corporate buyer has replaced the public in the 
market this year, as mutual fund investors in particular have pulled back. One 
buying mania has replaced another, yet the best the broad market can do is hold 
steady. That's not what bull markets are about. Synergy? What Synergy? 
</P>
<P>
 Investors haven't been kind to stocks of the bidders in the latest takeover 
wave: Most have fallen since they announced their bids. A look at some of the 
biggest deals of recent months and how the bidders' stocks have fared.

 Skidding automotive stocks and lackluster buying ahead of important economic 
data weighed down Wall Street on Thursday, with the market closing lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term bond yields moved higher after a Federal Reserve official suggested 
that an employment report due out today might prompt the central bank to raise 
short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Investment downgrades hit shares of the Big Three auto makers early, setting 
the tone for the session. Selling intensified toward the close after bond 
prices slumped on renewed fears that the Fed will raise interest rates again. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors, meanwhile, saw no reason to buy ahead of jobs data due out today 
that could move the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which reached its highest level since 
mid-June earlier this week, fell 26.87 points, closing at 3,765.79 as 294.29 
million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Losers outnumbered gainers 4 to 3 on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns about what the Labor Department's employment data might suggest about 
economic growth caused many investors to sit on the sidelines Thursday. Most 
analysts expect the number of new jobs created in July to come in at about 
215,000, significantly lower than June's levels and indicating that the economy 
has slowed a bit and inflation is under control. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech in Salt Lake City, Wayne Parry, president of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of San Francisco, said it isn't clear that there is any slack in the labor 
market. Investors took that to mean that if the July data shows higher 
employment than is expected, the Fed may be prompted to raise short-term 
interest rates to cool off the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Parry's comments spooked bond traders, and the yield on the Treasury's 
bellwether 30-year bond rose to 7.40% from 7.34% on Wednesday. Its price, which 
moves in the opposite direction, was down a quarter-point, or $2.50 per $1,000 
in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond selloff heightened anxiety among equity investors, who had been 
optimistic all week that a series of recent statistics portraying moderate 
economic growth would allow the Fed to keep interest rates where they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks had rallied earlier in the week amid hopes for steady interest rates, 
but the renewed doubts about the rate outlook Thursday spurred selling. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Metz, vice president at Oppenheimer & Co., said the analysts' demotion 
of automotive issues cast a pall over the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "The story today was autos," Metz said. "It put a chill on the market 
overall." 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of the Big Three car makers fell in heavy trading after Merrill Lynch 
downgraded them for reporting the weakest sales in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors closely monitor auto stocks as bellwethers of economically sensitive 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * General Motors tumbled 2 1/8 to 50 3/4, Ford fell 2 to 29 1/2 and Chrysler 
Corp. was off 1 3/4 at 45 5/8, all on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 * An issue making its debut on the Big Board, Shandong Huaneng Power 
Development, was the volume leader, with 14.07 million American depository 
receipts changing hands. It closed at 14 1/4, unchanged from its offering 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 * Georgia-Pacific fell 2 3/8 to 67. Goldman Sachs removed the stock from its 
"recommended" list. Other paper stocks were also weak, including International 
Paper, off 1 1/8 at 75, and Weyerhaeuser, which dipped 1 1/8 to 43. 
</P>
<P>
 * Caremark International fell 2 3/4 to 22 3/4 in response to news that the 
company, a big supplier of intravenous drugs, was indicted for allegedly paying 
more than $1.1 million in kickbacks to a doctor who referred his patients to 
Caremark. 
</P>
<P>
 * General Electric dropped 1 1/8 to 48 1/2. GE's Kidder, Peabody & Co. 
subsidiary released an in-house probe of a costly and embarrassing financial 
scandal that blames fired star trader Joseph Jett as the major culprit. The 
probe revealed lapses of supervision at the brokerage, and Kidder said it fired 
the manager who hired Jett three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wal-Mart Stores slipped 5/8 to 24 3/8 after the retailer reported its sales 
fell slightly in July. Sears Roebuck, which also had lower July sales, fell 7/8 
to 47 1/4. Dayton Hudson rose 7/8 to 83 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * VSLI plunged 1 1/2 to 13 on news that Intel was discontinuing a technology 
agreement with VSLI to develop a new computer product and was divesting its 
stake in the company. Intel fell 1 3/4 to 57 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chiron rose 1 1/4 to 55 1/4 in response to news that it has entered a pact 
with Ribozyme Pharmaceuticals to develop drugs to treat HIV and several other 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Action overseas offered little to inspire U.S. traders. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average ended down 15.56 points at 2,183.36 as 
chemical stocks eased and weaker bond futures prices dampened market sentiment. 
In London, the Financial Times 100-share average closed at 3,150.5, down 9.9 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks ended slightly firmer in Tokyo, with the Nikkei-225 average rising 
44.11 points to close at 20,676.84. Mexico's Bolsa index rose 6.50 points to 
close at 2573.81, its fifth straight gain and its highest level since March 7. 
</P>
<P>
 In currency trading, the dollar advanced in largely technical dealings ahead 
of the July employment report, with a rumored impending U.S. invasion of Haiti 
giving the greenback an early lift. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar rose to its high for the week against the German mark, despite the 
absence of any significant new economic data or policy statements, a move 
PaineWebber Vice President Stephen Flanagan called a "bullish signal." 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed in New York at 1.588 German marks, up from 1.578 on 
Wednesday. It also rose against the Japanese yen, closing at 100.38 yen, up 
from 100.35. 
</P>
<P>
 Lumber prices ended lower Wednesday after a Canadian-U.S. trade panel struck 
down American tariffs on Canadian wood imports. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling by the joint panel could free up Canadian timber exports to the 
United States, which have been restricted since 1992 by a 6.5% duty collected 
by the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the effect on prices, traders said they were skeptical about the 
actual impact of the ruling. It was the third time the tariff had been struck 
down by a bi-national panel and it was uncertain whether lumber mills would 
lower prices once the tariff was removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the ruling, lumber prices gyrated within a $17 range, on rumors that 
British Columbia timber workers were staging wildcat strikes. A union had in 
fact just called for strike vote. 
</P>
<P>
 September lumber ended $7.30 lower at $334.30 per 1,000 board feet, the lowest 
price for the spot contract since April 29.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: YOUR MONEY; ARBITRATORS UNFAIR, CAR OWNERS 
SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than one-fifth of Toyota, Lexis and Porsche owners who participated in a 
program to resolve warranty disputes in 1993 thought they were treated fairly, 
a survey shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, administered by the American Automobile Assn., has been 
discontinued. As previously reported, AAA said it decided to get out of the 
arbitration business to focus resources on activities that served its members. 
The decision came as regulators in Florida and California questioned the 
fairness of the AAA program. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the survey, 19% of the car owners using the arbitration program 
thought they were treated fairly and 63% of participants said they did not get 
the award they wanted. The survey was conducted by the California Arbitration 
Review Board, which each year asks participants' opinions of state-certified 
arbitration programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Arbitration programs are intended to settle warranty disputes without costly 
lawsuits. An arbitrator may order the manufacturer to replace or repair a 
vehicle under warranty or to offer the consumer restitution. The arbitrator may 
also deny the claim or propose some other settlement. The process is binding on 
the manufacturer but not on the consumer, who may go to court if dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford owners were the group most satisfied with arbitration. According to the 
survey, 47% who went through arbitration thought the process was fair and 
received the results they were looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found that 35% of General Motors owners thought arbitrators had 
treated them fairly. The Better Business Bureau runs the GM program, and it 
tends to mediate a high percentage of cases before they reach arbitration. 
One-quarter of Chrysler owners said the arbitrators were fair. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey comes as the Legislature is considering a bill that would replace 
manufacturers' programs with a state-run board. A Senate Judiciary Committee 
hearing on the bill is scheduled for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>

 Shock around the clock: Talk about scaring up business. In mail solicitations 
for its accidental-death policy, Allstate Insurance Co. traces the steps of a 
make-believe guy, A.J. Smith, as he narrowly escapes disaster 20 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Among A.J.'s close encounters: He is nearly killed crossing a street and feels 
threatened when a fired co-worker returns to the office to argue. 
</P>
<P>
 A.J.'s family is accident-prone. His wife nearly strikes a lamppost while 
driving. An electric socket at home is overloaded. A.J.'s kids gulp their food 
and risk choking -- no doubt because they know the wiring is about to blow. 
</P>
<P>
 We can only hope that after such a charmed day, A.J. doesn't settle into his 
recliner and croak from a heart attack. The accidental-death policy wouldn't 
cover him then. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to what we see as the moral of this story: Accidental death 
policies are inexpensive because coverage is limited. Premium dollars are 
better spent on life insurance, which also covers accidental deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sounding the alarm: The cost of having a security alarm service is likely to 
go up as a result of telephone rate increases tentatively approved by the 
California Public Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan L. Pepper, an attorney representing the California Alarm Assn., said the 
state's security alarm industry expects its costs to rise by $15 million to $20 
million a year if the PUC adopts the rate increases next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepper said the biggest increases will come in private-line services, in which 
the security company leases a separate dedicated phone line for each alarm 
system it monitors. High-risk establishments such as jewelry stores, drugstores 
and government agencies use private-line services. 
</P>
<P>
 For GTE customers, for example, installation charges for a private line are 
expected to jump to $253.87 from $92. Monthly charges would triple to $18.08 
from $6. 
</P>
<P>
 Residential customers whose alarm services run on their regular phone lines 
may see a small boost in security charges because local phone rates are also 
rising, Pepper said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Holding the line: How's this for encouragement? In mailings offering customers 
a $20 discount on phone installation, Pacific Bell warns that "installation 
charges may increase substantially as a result of rate proceedings currently 
under review by the California Public Utilities Commission." 
</P>
<P>
 The warning appears outdated. In a tentative ruling issued last month, the PUC 
turned down PacBell's request to raise installation rates. They are expected to 
remain at $34.75 for each residential line and $70.75 for each business line. 
The discount offer expires Aug. 14. How They Did... 
</P>
<P>
 The state Arbitration Review Board examined how arbitrators settled auto 
warranty disputes in 1993. New-car owners can seek arbitration of disputes over 
defects or repairs if they are dissatisfied with the dealer's response. The 
state-monitored program is intended to head off costly lawsuits.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; AUTO STOCKS SKID, TAKING DOW WITH THEM; YIELDS RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Time Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks dropped in a late selloff Thursday, hurt by a slide in auto stocks and 
jitters ahead of today's report on July employment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials slumped 26.87 points to 3,765.79, with most of the decline 
occurring in the last hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broad market, losers outnumbered winners by 12 to 9 on the New York 
Stock Exchange in active trading of 294 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the day, heavy selling of the Big Three auto stocks dampened the 
market's tone. The stocks fell after a Merrill Lynch analyst downgraded them to 
"neutral" from "above average" in the wake of disappointing July auto sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "The story (Thursday) was autos," said Michael Metz, analyst at Oppenheimer & 
Co. "It put a chill on the market overall." 
</P>
<P>
 As the day wore on, analysts said investors began to concentrate on the 
possibility of another official interest rate hike soon by the Federal Reserve 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the market's worries stemmed from the government's report Thursday 
that the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits last week declined 
to the lowest level since February. 
</P>
<P>
 That set the stage for today's report on July employment. If job creation was 
robust last month, investors fear, the Fed will be compelled to raise 
short-term interest rates again to further cool the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech in Salt Lake City, Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of San Francisco, heightened investors' worries when he said that the Fed 
worries about a lack of slack in the job market -- potentially signaling higher 
wage inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the stock market seemed to be far more worried Thursday than the bond 
market. Bond yields closed only slightly higher, with the 30-year Treasury bond 
yield finishing at 7.40% compared to 7.38% on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Merrill Lynch's downgrade pushed GM shares down 2 1/8 to 50 3/4, Ford down 2 
to 29 1/2 and Chrysler down 1 3/4 to 45 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Some auto parts suppliers also fell. Eaton dropped 1 7/8 to 49, Goodyear lost 
1 1/8 to 33 7/8 and TRW was off 3/8 to 71 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Paper and lumber stocks, which have soared recently, were hit by profit 
taking. Georgia-Pacific fell 2 3/8 to 67 after brokerage Goldman Sachs removed 
the stock from its "recommended" list. Other losers included International 
Paper, off 1 1/8 to 75, and Weyerhaeuser, down 1 1/8 to 43. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oil stocks also came under pressure. Phillips lost 1 3/8 to 30 1/2, Mobil 
sank 1 1/2 to 82 3/8 and Unocal eased 5/8 to 28 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Retailers were mixed after reporting July sales. Wal-Mart fell 5/8 to 24 3/8 
and Lowe's tumbled 3 3/8 to 32 3/4 on disappointing sales reports, but Dayton 
Hudson gained 7/8 to 83 1/8 and electronics retailer Circuit City jumped 1 3/8 
to 22 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Caremark International fell 2 3/8 to 21 1/8 in response to news that the 
company, a big supplier of intravenous drugs, was indicted for allegedly paying 
more than $1.1 million in kickbacks to a doctor who referred his patients to 
Caremark. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shandong Huaneng Power Development made its initial public stock offering 
and closed on the NYSE at 14 1/4, the same as its offering price. The company 
owns interests in certain coal-fired electric power generating plants in 
fast-growing Shandong Province, China. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among the day's big losers, California Micro Devices shares collapsed when a 
slew of fourth-quarter product returns led investors to speculate that the 
company could face future accounting concerns. The stock plunged 8 7/8 to 13 
1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the takeover rumor mill, Warner Lambert jumped 2 1/8 to 74 3/8 as some 
traders bet the company could be the next health care target. But other drug 
stocks were mixed. Schering-Plough fell 1 to 66 5/8 and Pfizer was unchanged at 
63 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among Southland issues, lingerie maker Body Drama jumped 1 1/8 to 2 3/4 
after the company's majority owner, Beeba's Creations, announced plans to take 
Body Drama private. A tender offer will be made at $2.93 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 In overseas trading, Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average ended down 15.56 points 
at 2,183.36 as chemical stocks eased and weaker bond futures prices dampened 
sentiment. In London, the FTSE-100 index eased 9.9 points to 3,150.5. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks ended slightly firmer in Tokyo, with the Nikkei-225 average rising 
44.11 points to 20,676.84. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index inched up 6.50 points to 2,573.81, its fifth 
straight gain and its highest level since March 7. 
</P>
<P>
 In currency trading, the dollar advanced in largely technical dealings ahead 
of the July employment report, with a rumored impending U.S. invasion of Haiti 
giving the greenback an early lift. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar rose to its high for the week against the German mark, despite the 
absence of any significant new economic data or policy statements, a move 
PaineWebber analyst Stephen Flanagan called a "bullish signal." 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed in New York at 1.588 German marks, up from 1.578 on 
Wednesday. It also rose against the Japanese yen, closing at 100.38 yen, up 
from 100.35. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodities markets, livestock futures surged, bolstered by signs of strong 
demand for meat. 
</P>
<P>
 But grain prices were lower. At the Chicago Board of Trade, widespread rains 
across the Midwest washed away concern about recent dryness in some states and 
pressured grain prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Soybean futures fell to a 20-month low amid prospects for record or 
near-record crops this year.

COMPANY TOWN; TAPED CALL CAN'T BE USED IN POLYGRAM SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A strange twist has developed in an already-bitter battle involving maverick 
record producer Rick Rubin, who wants to get out of a venture his American 
Recordings has with a unit of PolyGram to sell his records overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin has sued in Los Angeles to break a venture with PolyGram's London-based 
Phonogram unit, arguing that it hasn't properly sold albums by his artists, 
which include the Black Crowes.He also claims he's owed nearly $14 million. 
Phonogram has countersued in Great Britain to make Rubin honor the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it comes out that Phonogram obtained through a hacker a tape recording of 
an allegedly juicy telephone conference call among Rubin, music lawyer John 
Branca and various Rubin executives, one of whom was on a cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court papers in London, a chief chancery master denied a request 
by Phonogram to enter the tape into evidence and has taken possession of it.

THE BIZ / JAMES BATES: COMPANY TOWN; MORRIS FINDS NEW LIFE UNDER RIFKIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In one pocket of his Armani trousers, Arnold Rifkin always carries something 
that undoubtedly sets him apart from most Hollywood agents: paper clips. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day he selects a handful of them -- not the small flimsy ones he detests 
but the thick, tough kind -- and stuffs them into a pocket. Throughout the day, 
he twists them, links them together, pulls them apart to release his abundant 
nervous energy. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time not long ago when it seemed that Rifkin had little more than 
paper clips to keep the motion picture group at the venerable William Morris 
Agency from unraveling altogether. The operation he walked into in October, 
1992 -- when Morris spent $25 million to buy the Triad Artists talent agency 
where Rifkin was a partner and subsequently head of its highest-profile unit -- 
was in tatters. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently departed were such stars as Julia Roberts, Tom Hanks, Michelle 
Pfeiffer and Mel Gibson, as well as directors such as Tim Burton and John 
McTiernan. Usually they left in tandem with their agents, who could not resist 
the siren-like calls of hotter rivals Creative Artists Agency and International 
Creative Management. Morris wasn't doing much to help: One agent already making 
$350,000 a year was said to be unable to get a $15,000 raise. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems had their genesis when agent legend Stan Kamen died in 1986, 
leaving a huge void. Kamen had represented a host of top stars, including 
Warren Beatty and Barbra Steisand. With nobody to fill his shoes, stars soon 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 Defections of stars and agents are any agency's worst nightmare -- Hollywood's 
equivalent of a bank run. A client or two leave and the whispering starts. A 
few more defections and you become George Bailey blocking the building and loan 
door in "It's a Wonderful Life," appealing to the loyalty of customers ready to 
head down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 It got so bad that the joke around Hollywood was if you were wanted by the 
police, Morris was the place to hide because nobody would find you. "The 
abyss," recalls veteran Morris agent John Burnham, who with colleague Mike 
Simpson had to hold the department together during its worst period. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony was that Morris remained financially strong. It is virtually 
debt-free, is one of Beverly Hills' bigger landlords, remains a major force in 
television with such shows as "Cosby" and "Roseanne," and continues to collect 
checks like an annuity from decades-old deals ranging from Elvis Presley 
projects to "MASH" episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the public image took a beating, and the Triad acquisition was meant to 
change that. On a practical level, Triad brought much needed clients -- Danny 
Glover, Emma Thompson, Daniel Day-Lewis and the actor most closely associated 
with Rifkin, Bruce Willis -- to join such longtime clients as Clint Eastwood. 
Triad also brought a first-rate music department that included top groups Pearl 
Jam, Nirvana and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. 
</P>
<P>
 It also brought Rifkin, 47, who became worldwide head of Morris' motion 
picture department. The former New York fur salesman at times makes agenting 
seem more like New Age-nting. For his first staff meeting, he insisted on using 
a screening room rather than the usual Morris conference room. "There had been 
too much negativity in that room," he says now. 
</P>
<P>
 To change the feel of the conference room, Rifkin strolled down the street, 
bought some Ralph Lauren bedsheets and covered the chairs with them. To get the 
right mood in his office, he supervised all details of the furnishings, 
including how deep guests sink into his couch. 
</P>
<P>
 Locker-room-like exhortations became common. One message was to "change 
channels, turn up the volume," intended to drown out the bad talk about the 
place. He printed T-shirts for the staff that said "Commit and Execute." 
</P>
<P>
 The merger -- dubbed "Armani meets Brooks Bros.," referring to Rifkin's 
stylishly dressed crew and the conservative Morris crowd -- survived most 
expectations. The two sides bonded as Rifkin had hoped. Agent Burnham, who 
today freely admits he couldn't stand Rifkin the first six months, became a big 
fan. Rifkin also controlled a notorious temper that had him screaming at 
everyone from studio executives to other agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have good fistfights, but at the end of the day we try to do what is best 
for both of us," says producer Andy Vajna, a Rifkin friend. Rifkin credits 
therapy with helping him control his temper." 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, the hemorrhaging stopped, though Morris lately has been 
fighting to keep one of its agents from jumping to CAA. There were some 
signings of new clients, notably director Walter Hill and actor Robert Duvall. 
Morris has been working to develop independent filmmakers and was especially 
buoyed by the recent Cannes Film Festival where "Pulp Fiction" -- with director 
Quentin Tarantino and actors Willis and John Travolta, all Morris clients -- 
was the big winner. As for Rifkin, in a vote of confidence he was recently made 
a member of the agency's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still detractors. The most pointed criticism is that Morris remains 
thin when it comes to bankable stars and directors that studios feel they need 
to make blockbusters -- a gap evidenced by their limited participation in some 
of the highest-grossing movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawling out of an abyss is no easy task. One lawyer says the agency's motion 
pictures group "used to be a low third, now they're a high third." 
</P>
<P>
 An insider adds, "On a scale of one to 10, it was a minus 5. Now it's a 5."

LICENSING SEEN AS KEY TO BIOMEDICINE'S RISE; RESEARCH: UCI'S PLANNED CENTER CAN 
HELP EXPAND THE INDUSTRY, PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND BUSINESS LEADERS AGREE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Only with the right research and licensing agreements can UC Irvine's planned 
biomedical research center help expand that industry in Orange County, public 
officials and business people agreed at a hearing Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaired by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), the morning session 
in the Irvine City Council's chambers drew several dozen company officials for 
a discussion of the role the research center might play in creating companies 
and jobs and how state government could encourage such growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers said academics and company executives must understand each other 
better to develop marketable products quickly from research. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, academics tend not to think about the patent potential of basic 
research, said Dr. Michael Selsted, associate vice chancellor for research and 
graduate study at the university. 
</P>
<P>
 But "if there isn't patent protection on a product, you can't attract 
investors," he said. "The first thing people say to us when they're talking 
about licensing a product for their company is, 'Has a patent been applied 
for?' " 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, some company officials said they must get better at imagining 
the commercial uses of new technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've licensed things from UCI before, but we tend not to do it because it's 
difficult" to obtain full commercial protections on publicly funded research, 
said W. Charles Johnson, a scientific officer with Fullerton-based Beckman 
Instruments Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The biomedical companies' heavy reliance on university research makes schools 
central to the development of a regional industry. In California, Orange County 
competes with San Diego and the San Francisco Bay Area for biomedical companies 
and jobs, and planners hope the proposed UCI center will advance this county's 
position as defense-manufacturing jobs decline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Companies follow universities," said David Anast, a local industry analyst. 
The UCI center will work especially well if its research focuses on products 
that can be manufactured easily, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anast, who publishes an industry newsletter, said he counted about a thousand 
medical manufacturers in Orange County in a recent survey. Of those, about a 
hundred make biological or pharmaceutical products; the others make biomedical 
products, particularly medical equipment and instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on the first building in UCI's Center for the Health Sciences is 
scheduled to begin in January. Dr. Thomas Cesario, acting dean of the UCI 
College of Medicine, said the university hopes to have 10 buildings on the 
43-acre site and that a private-sector research park will grow on an adjacent 
250-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the funding for the first building, a $22-million neuroscience 
research center, will be provided by state bonds. UCI's medical school is 
contributing $6 million, and $1 million was bequeathed by a faculty member. UCI 
is still trying to raise the remaining $4 million to complete the building, a 
spokeswoman said. There are no plans to fund the other buildings yet, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's biomedical industry is sure to lure new companies to fill the 
research park. Daniel Korpolinski, president and chief executive of 
Irvine-based Cocensys, said biotechnology companies depend closely on the 
expertise of others nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Cocensys, which develops and markets drugs to treat conditions such as 
epilepsy, sleep disorders and head trauma, is itself a spinoff from work done 
by USC faculty, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Korpolinski said the state could support companies like his by reducing the 
amount of administrative tasks required to do business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're overburdened with permits and with forms," he said. "We'd like to 
cooperate to help truncate the process" of paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 The state could also help by addressing more general issues such as improving 
the quality of public education. He said potential employees from out of the 
state tell him they worry about public education when they think about 
relocating to California. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedom Communications Chief Executive James Rosse, chairman of a committee 
looking at links between UCI and the business community, said Orange County's 
situation reminds him of Silicon Valley's growth around Stanford University, 
where he was once provost. 
</P>
<P>
 At Stanford, at the height of the boom, he said, "it was sometimes hard to 
tell who were the academics and who were the entrepreneurs."

ENGINEERING FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fluor Corp. said Thursday that its vice chairman, Vince Kontny, has decided to 
take early retirement after 29 years at the engineering giant. 
</P>
<P>
 Kontny, 57, said in a statement that he looking forward to spending more time 
with his family and on outside interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have mixed emotions leaving at this time, given the company's considerable 
success," Kontny said. Second-quarter net income for Fluor was $47.7 million, 
up 14% over the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor Chairman Les McCraw praised Kontny as having "made a significant 
contribution to the company, particularly with his participation in the 
creation of Fluor Daniel in 1986 and its growth since that time."

 Merger Suit Filed: Shareholders of Viratek Inc. and SPI Pharmaceuticals Inc. 
have filed two lawsuits in Delaware, where the companies are incorporated, 
seeking to block the companies' proposed merger with ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., 
which would create a $500-million company. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa-based ICN Pharmaceuticals said Tuesday it planned to merge with 
Viratek, SPI and ICN Biomedicals Inc., all in which ICN Pharmaceuticals holds a 
major stake. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the suits, filed by shareholder Solomon Jallath, contends that the 
proposed exchange of stock is unfair and does not maximize shareholder value 
for owners of Viratek and SPI stock. 
</P>
<P>
 David Calef, spokesman for all four companies, responded, "We think the merger 
provides the best value for all shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
 The stock of three of the four companies dropped Wednesday to prices below 
Monday's pre-announcement prices. Only ICN Biomedicals stock has risen, from 
$3.50 Monday to $3.875 at Thursday's close. ICN Pharmaceuticals shares dropped 
to $9.625 Thursday from Monday's three-month high of $10.50; Viratek common 
stock fell to $9.50 from Monday's $10.75, and SPI shares dropped to $18.625 
from $21 on Monday. ICN Pharmaceuticals is traded on the New York Stock 
Exchange, the others on the American Stock Exchange.

RECALLING OR FABRICATING PAST ABUSE?; PSYCHOTHERAPY: MICHAEL YAPKO SAYS MUCH 
SO-CALLED 'RECOVERED MEMORY' IS IN FACT SUGGESTED BY COUNSELORS. OTHERS FIND 
MERITS IN THEIR METHODS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNE WRIGHT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To psychologist and author Michael Yapko, much of what goes on in the name of 
psychotherapy is "blatantly stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 First there was Freud's theory of penis envy, then in the 1970s there were 
nude encounters and LSD therapy. Today, people delve into past-life regression 
and turn to crystals for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of it "is just moronic," says the San Diego therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yapko, an expert in memory and hypnosis, says the therapy most en vogue 
today goes beyond absurdity. Recalling memories of sexual abuse -- either real 
or imagined -- is the latest fad in psychotherapy -- and it may be the most 
dangerous, Yapko warns. 
</P>
<P>
 His controversial new book, "Suggestions of Abuse"(Simon & Schuster, $22), is 
an indictment of mental health professionals who lead their patients to 
mistakenly believe they are victims of sexual abuse, thus recklessly and 
unwittingly destroying lives and families. 
</P>
<P>
 Yapko, a soft-spoken clinician, has created an uproar among mental health 
professionals by writing the first book to take the profession to task for its 
techniques in recovering memory, based on research and surveys of nearly 900 
therapists across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics who disagree with Yapko's views say he exaggerates the problem, relies 
on inconclusive research and may frighten real abuse victims, keeping them from 
seeking psychological help. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very dangerous implication," contends Lenore Terr, a San Francisco 
psychologist who writes about recovered memory cases in her recently published 
book, "Unchained Memories" (Basic Books, HarperCollins, $22). 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people who have extreme anxiety and need psychotherapy. 
And if they start thinking that evil therapists will get ahold of them and 
force them into believing things, I think we are going to lose a lot of people 
who could have been helped," Terr cautions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Public debate over recovered memories has raged in the press and been 
highlighted in several high-profile court cases, including the lawsuit 
involving Holly Ramona, an Irvine woman who accused her father of molesting 
her. The accusations arose while she was under therapy at Western Medical 
Center-Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Yapko's research sought to determine the level and quality of his colleagues' 
expertise in the area of memories and hypnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 His conclusion is that some therapists engaging in recovered memory therapy 
are "frighteningly" misinformed and are suggesting memories of abuse that may 
never have happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised and in many cases shocked . . . that so many of my colleagues 
are conducting their clinical practice on the basis of misinformation and 
myth," Yapko said during an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before "recovered memories" became the trendy topic of talk shows, Yapko 
had begun to express dismay over the growing preoccupation therapists had with 
finding evidence of past abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1980s, while writing a textbook on the clinical use of hypnosis, 
Yapko says he would get called about once every three months by a therapist 
asking that he hypnotize a patient to determine if the patient had been 
sexually abused as a child. 
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1980s, the frequency of such calls from therapists had grown to 
nearly daily. Concerned, he warned therapists in the revised edition of his 
textbook about the potential dangers of using hypnosis or other suggestive 
techniques to unearth buried memories. 
</P>
<P>
 He was soon inundated with calls, letters and visits from people all over the 
country who feared they had been mishandled by a therapist, that their memories 
of abuse may have been untrue and their lives shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yapko says it was one particularly desperate phone call from a woman who 
wanted him to hypnotize her that really spurred him to write "Suggestions of 
Abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the straw that broke the camel's back," Yapko recalls. She said she 
wanted to discover if she had been sexually abused as a child. "What makes you 
think you might have been abused?" Yapko asked. The woman responded: "Well, I 
called another therapist for help with my poor self-esteem, and she told me 
that I must have been abused as a child and I should have hypnosis to find 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Yapko was stunned. "I thought, this is crazy," he says. 
</P>
<P>

 "When I first started talking about this in 1991, (colleagues) were real 
irritated," Yapko says. "It was not politically correct to raise any doubts 
about therapists' practices in such a sensitive arena like sexual abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the profession is still polarized over the issue of recovered 
memories, Yapko says increasing numbers of colleagues accept the warning that 
if not used properly, hypnosis and other techniques may lead patients to adopt 
false memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I really want to make clear is that abuse does happen with alarming 
frequency. . . . This is not about disbelieving or discounting abuse 
survivors," Yapko says. 
</P>
<P>
 "But under conditions of sloppy therapy, people can be led to believe things 
that are not true, including that they were abused." 
</P>
<P>
 Yapko says he wrote the book to both educate and alert the public and help 
families who have become entangled in these cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Allegations based on supposed repressed memories have reached epidemic 
proportions in this country, he says.  
</P>
<P>
 In surveys presented to therapists at psychotherapy conventions, he questioned 
professionals about their knowledge and practice of recovering memories and 
hypnosis. He surveyed those at therapy training courses he taught. He also 
viewed videotapes of therapists' sessions with patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The recovered memory theory holds that people who may have suffered a 
traumatic experience such as sexual abuse may repress or psychologically block 
out the memory because it is too painful. At a later time, the memory may 
surface on its own or be recovered with the help of hypnosis, counseling or 
drug therapy, according to some professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Yapko doesn't deny that some people may repress terrible memories. But he and 
others admit that there is no way to know if a reclaimed memory is true unless 
there is corroborating evidence.  
</P>
<P>
 James L. McGaugh, director of UCI's Center for the Neurobiology of Learning 
and Memory, is a scientist who has done research in the field of memory since 
1956. He says the recovered memory movement among some therapists is 
"absolutely irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
 McGaugh insists there is no scientific evidence to prove that so-called 
recovered memories are accurate.  
</P>
<P>
 The number of cases in which people are claiming to have sudden memories of 
terrible experiences in their past is astonishing, he says. There is an entire 
"cottage industry" that has grown up around this kind of therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 He says people are willing to embrace the therapy because they want some kind 
of explanation for why they have problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin lawyer Brandt Caudill, who often defends therapists in lawsuits 
stemming from repressed memory cases, says there has been a dramatic upswing in 
lawsuits filed against therapists by patients who contend they were wronged 
during therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent verdict in the Ramona case had a significant impact on the public, 
Caudill says. In May, a Napa Valley Superior Court jury awarded Gary Ramona 
$500,000, ruling that his daughter's therapists had wronged him by implanting 
false memories of child abuse during her therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Caudill said his office alone has about two dozen cases pending in California 
courts.  
</P>
<P>
 The American Psychiatric Assn.'s Board of Trustees issued a statement in 
December expressing concern that "the public confusion and dismay over this 
issue and the possibility of false accusations not discredit the reports of 
patients who have indeed been traumatized by actual previous abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yapko's concern lies with how patients' memories are being recalled and what 
role therapists and other outside influences may have played in forming that 
memory.  
</P>
<P>
 Did the patient remember the memory independently? Or did a therapist draw it 
out under hypnosis, under the influence of the drug sodium Amytal or during 
suggestive questioning? Was it in a dream? Or could the memory be an image once 
seen in a movie or read in a book? 
</P>
<P>
 The therapists' responses to his survey "indicate grave cause for concern," 
Yapko says. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the great majority of therapists are well-intentioned people who 
genuinely want to help their clients, the survey data make it abundantly clear 
that too many therapists hold beliefs that are sometimes arbitrary, sometimes 
sheer myth, and sometimes outright dangerous to their clients' well-being," 
Yapko writes in the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 864 therapists who responded to one portion of the survey, 57% admitted 
"that they do nothing at all to differentiate truth from fiction" when dealing 
with patients' memories, Yapko writes. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-three percent of the therapists who participated in the survey believed 
that "if someone doesn't remember much about his or her childhood, it is most 
likely because it was somehow traumatic," he reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Although research on hypnosis as an effective investigative method shows 
conflicting results, nearly half believe that memories obtained under hypnosis 
are more accurate than simply remembering, Yapko says.  
</P>
<P>
 Hypnosis is "not a lie detector, nor does it prevent either intentional or 
unintentional deception on the part of the hypnotized person," Yapko writes. 
Yet one in five of the therapists questioned said they believed that people 
cannot lie under hypnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Yapko said he was heartened to find that 75% believed it is possible to 
"suggest false memories to someone who then incorporates them as true 
memories." Nearly one in five therapists said they could point to cases where 
it seemed likely that a victim's trauma was somehow suggested by the therapist 
rather than a real experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Terr, an author and clinical professor of psychiatry at UC San Francisco, 
disagrees with Yapko over the frequency of patients being mishandled by 
therapists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he overstates the problem," Terr said in an interview.  
</P>
<P>
 She is an expert on trauma and memory and is known for her research on the 
kidnaped children of Chowchilla. She was an expert witness for the prosecution 
in the 1991 murder conviction of George Franklin in Redwood City. Franklin was 
found guilty based on his daughter's testimony that, after 20 years, she 
suddenly remembered seeing her father murder her childhood friend. Terr also 
testified on the behalf of the therapists sued in the Gary Ramona case. 
</P>
<P>
 Terr, who has faced off against Yapko on the talk show circuit, says it is 
rare for recovered memories to be wholly false. She also disagrees with Yapko's 
view that many mental health professionals are so misinformed about memory that 
they are planting memories in their patients' minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Most therapists are well-intentioned and treat people properly, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it sometimes happens. . . . There are a few rotten eggs in any 
basket. . . . But he has numbers that I really would find mind-boggling.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the number of people who are having true return of memory are much 
greater than the number of people who are having implanted memories by someone 
else," Terr says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yapko contends the risk of patients' true memories being contaminated or 
false memories being suggested is very real. 
</P>
<P>
 In his book, he cites examples of some of the comments and questioning 
techniques used by therapists that he believes can carelessly lead patients to 
develop false memories of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the lack of evidence to suspect the patient was abused, according to 
Yapko, a therapist might say, "Your symptoms seem to fit the profile of someone 
who was sexually abused as a child. Were you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Another approach may be, "I have reason to believe you were sexually abused as 
a child. Can you think of any experiences you might have had that would be 
considered evidence of abuse?" 
</P>
<P>
 These types of statements and questions can lead to confusion and distress and 
potentially taint real memories with sexual connotations, Yapko argues. After 
hearing these remarks, the patient is forced to consider the possibility that 
he may have been abused, even if he never had any reason to believe so. 
Sometimes allegations of satanic ritual abuse and evidence in these cases sound 
very far-fetched to observers, said attorney Caudill. "But look at the Jeffrey 
Dahmer case, the Branch Davidians or the Jim Jones case. These cases were very 
outlandish." No one would have believed such events could have happened, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion of going to a therapist seeking help for a specific problem and 
having them suggest -- without any corroborating evidence -- that you may have 
been sexually abused as a child is frightening, said Yapko. 
</P>
<P>
 He advises adults and parents of young children who are going to therapy to be 
wary of mental health professionals who jump to conclusions and offer snap 
opinions on whether the patient fits a profile of an abuse victim. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a legitimate concern," Yapko said. "There are paranoid therapists. 
There are therapists who are intent on finding abuse with no matter what 
someone comes in for, including acne."

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; KROQ OF AGES; DEEJAY RICHARD BLADE TUNES INTO 
TEEN FANS WHO TUNE INTO HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE MONETTE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Christine Monette will be a senior 
this fall at Rosary High School in Fullerton. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a summer state of mind, many Orange County teens are sleeping in and waking 
up to the voice of Richard Blade, KROQ's disc jockey from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Blade, known for his flashback lunches (playing old favorites at the noon 
hour) and many promotional club appearances, draws listeners with his British 
accent and energy, both on the air and off. A 6-foot-3 bachelor in his early 
40s, Blade loves working at what he calls, "the greatest station on Earth." 
Some of the benefits: He hears the new music first and can go to any concert he 
wants. 
</P>
<P>
 KROQ-FM (106.7) out of Burbank has been a driving force in the popular trend 
of alternative rock music.  
</P>
<P>
 This year, KROQ is third overall in Arbitron ratings for the L.A. market; it 
received Billboard's station of the year award in 1993 and the Rolling Stone 
Reader's Choice award of station of the year in 1993 and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributing to that success is Blade, who grew up in England and moved to 
California, he says, for three reasons: sunshine, blue skies and California 
women.  
</P>
<P>
 Blake usually works five nights a week at clubs as a deejay, which gives him 
the chance to play whatever music he wants and to see the audience reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite often I'm the first one who can come back (to the station) and tell 
Kevin, our program director, that (Orange County alternative-rock band) 
Offspring is going to be huge, or Greenday is going to be huge, because I'll 
put it on at the club and people will scream and run out, so you know it is 
going to do well." 
</P>
<P>
 Blade loves to dance, but because he spends most of his club time as a deejay, 
he has to settle for dancing behind the deejay booth. "On the fifth night it's 
sometimes a little tiring, but I never ever take it for granted. I really love 
my job, and I like meeting the people, and I really like playing the club 
music." 
</P>
<P>
 Not every encounter with listeners is wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst is when people stop you in a supermarket when you are just in a 
T-shirt and shorts and they'll say, 'Do you have any tickets?' And you'll say, 
'I'm sorry, I don't,' and they'll say, 'Give me some T-shirts then.' And you 
are just wearing your own T-shirt and shorts and it's obvious you are not 
carrying anything and you go, 'I don't have anything on me. I got some stickers 
in my car,' and they'll (get mad) and walk off . . . but that is, fortunately, 
rare." 
</P>
<P>
 A large portion of KROQ's listening audience is teens. Blade says he considers 
it a responsibility to not promote drugs or drinking. KROQ music does not focus 
specifically on teens like some stations do, he said, but teens are listened to 
and respected as KROQ listeners.  
</P>
<P>
 "We accept teens as part of the audience; they are not the audience, but they 
are a part of it, and we don't like to differentiate and say you are an adult, 
and you are a teen; you are part of the audience and you are equal," Blake 
said. This may be one reason why the station has such broad appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The station receives hundreds of new record releases each week. After the 
music directors sort out the really bad stuff, Blake said, the deejays will 
listen to about 50 CDs in one of their weekly meetings, which can go for hours. 
"If you are the 49th CD, you better be damn good because we are nearly asleep 
by then," Blake said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teens play a big part in discovering new music. They are the ones who "have 
their ears to the ground," Black said. Teens call the request lines most 
frequently, so if the station receives a lot of requests for a song, it will be 
moved up in the rotation. If it's a song the station hasn't been playing, 
deejays will go back and listen to it again, to see what they've been missing. 
</P>
<P>
 The radio station continues to evolve. "One thing KROQ will never be is the 
same the next day," Blake said. "At KROQ we are always trying to change. As 
important as the flashbacks are to us . . . we are always trying to get the new 
music and the new direction. Five years ago we were very much in a dance mode, 
as in Depeche Mode. Now we are very much into grunge and rock, and also punk 
now, with Greenday and Offspring, etc. We don't know where we are going to be 
tomorrow -- we just want to get the best music we can.  
</P>
<P>
 "Just as teens change everyday and every generation, so we want to change 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 The station plans to be on-line by the end of the year, so that deejays will 
be able to communicate with listeners instantly through E-mail. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Blade didn't always dream of being a deejay. When he was 12, he wanted to be a 
marine biologist. So now he occasionally teaches scuba diving instead. He also 
wanted to be an actor. After graduating from an all-boys school, he went on to 
receive his BA in acting from Westminster College at Oxford. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has had parts in various plays, he likes radio better because 
"acting takes so long. Radio is live and immediate; you do it and you are out 
of there. With acting it takes all day to do one scene, so it can drive you 
crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Blade said that when he was growing up in England there was a lot less 
pressure than at present in the United States. "In England, a gang was just a 
group of guys or girls. A drive-by would be when you drive by a girls' school 
to check out the babes." 
</P>
<P>
 Blade was inspired by some college deejays, but his greatest motivation 
happened while working as a club deejay throughout Europe. He was living out of 
a suitcase, working different countries. While in Switzerland, graffiti on an 
apartment wall caught his eye. Written by a disillusioned club deejay, it said: 
"You can sing along with the radio, but you can never be on it." Blade made up 
his mind that day that he would be on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Blade has worked as a deejay at a variety of stations from Bakersfield to San 
Luis Obispo. At the smaller ones, he had to do everything from selling time to 
taking out the trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Blade says he really wanted to work at KROQ, even while being a deejay at KNAC 
in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to come around about once a week and drop off a tape (at KROQ) and 
say, 'Anytime you get a vacancy, I'm your man.' And one day the program 
director, Rick Carroll, called up and said, 'We've got an opening for two weeks 
while someone is on vacation. You'll have to quit your job at KNAC, and you'll 
have to work for us for free." 
</P>
<P>
 Blade said yes, he'd do it. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of his first shift, the station owner came in and asked if he 
worked there. When Blake said he was just filling in, the owner told him not 
anymore, "I'll find a space for you." Blade served as production director for 
three months and was then given the morning show. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Blade says goal-setting is very important, but for now he's fulfilled the 
goals he set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to come to the States, and I did; I wanted to work at the greatest 
station in the world, and I am; I wanted to do TV, and I have; I wanted to do 
films, and I have; I wanted to write a couple screenplays and I did, and sold 
them. And now . . . my goal is just to be the best that I can be within the 
radio station." 
</P>
<P>
 Blade says he is shy and being a deejay helps him to be extroverted and meet 
people. Asking someone if they listen to KROQ is a lot better line than, "Do 
you come here often?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blade sees music as part of a continuum. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my dad's age, people listened to Chubby Checker and Bill Haley and the 
Comets, and the world was going to hell in a handbasket. Before that, people 
listened to Marty Shore and Glenn Miller and the Big Bands, and before that 
there was the Charleston and ragtime. I don't think Pearl Jam is the end of the 
world; I think it's just the next evolution in music." 
</P>
<P>
 In 20 to 30 years, today's teens will be in positions of power, Blade says, 
and he hopes that they run things better than previous generations. He says he 
strongly believes in women leaders. "I think women make great leaders when it 
comes to politics, much better than men as a rule." 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up is getting harder, he says, with more difficult and dangerous 
pressures every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Blade offers these words of advice: "Try and keep away from drugs, (although) 
I know it's really hard; don't marry too young, and set yourself a goal. Don't 
be surprised if your life goal changes as you go along. I never planned to be a 
deejay . . . but I love what I'm doing. Be prepared to be flexible as you go 
along in life, and don't let pressure push you off your path. Take your time 
and realize you're still young."

 Virginity is only a state of mind. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the message some New York City educators want to get across to sexually 
active teens: It's never too late to become a virgin.The name for the concept? 
Secondary virginity. 
</P>
<P>
 It's "a nice way of saying that even if you have been sleeping around for 
years, you can be clean again," one proponent said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is wrong with telling a child that it's a good idea to stop (having 
sex)? That is what we promote for drugs," board of education advisory member 
Liliana Trivelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the board's student representative, Andrea Schlesinger, 17, said she 
doesn't think the idea will apply to most of her peers. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondary virginity implies that "you can make up for your mistake," 
Schlesinger, 17, said. "For many young people, it was not a mistake."

 What do trees do when they're dying of thirst? They cry out loud! 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists have recently learned that some trees give off ultrasonic chirps -- 
sounds that are too high for humans to hear -- during a drought. And the 
thirstier the trees get, the more they chirp. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound weird? Not to bark beetles, says one scientist who has been studying the 
sounds. The insects, which attack sick trees, may listen for the chirps. 
</P>
<P>
 The trees' chirps are being recorded to see if they help the insects tell an 
unhealthy tree from a healthy one. "When I slowed down the tape to hear the 
chirps," the researcher said, "they sounded like bongo drums or popcorn 
popping!"

MY TURN: OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; EVEN HEROES ARE ONLY HUMAN, SO PUT 
THE PEDESTALS AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RACHI SHIH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Rachi Shih is a junior at Sunny Hills High 
School in Fullerton. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every kid has a hero. Having one -- be it a firefighter, Hillary Clinton or a 
Mighty Morphin Power Ranger -- is a fundamental part of growing up, a basic 
characteristic of childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, kids are given a wide spectrum from which to select their idols. From 
sports heroes to powerful magnates, they are the object of adoration for 
kindergartners to adolescents. Some even become lifelong heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as we place these superstars onto pedestals, we often forget that they 
are real people too -- people who stumble over cracks in the sidewalk and who 
succumb to the same pressures we do. When we realize this astonishing fact, we 
feel confused and lost, for our personal icons have fallen from their platforms 
-- an inconceivable event. 
</P>
<P>
 We need to understand that is was we who made our heroes who they are. Heroes 
are ordinary people without their public and support, yet we expect them to be 
supernatural. Though it is hard, we need to accept that a fallen star is a 
normal human being and that he or she was always such, even at the height of 
greatness. 
</P>
<P>
 Take O.J. Simpson, now charged with a double homicide. The Simpson case is 
spurring debates on the legitimacy of our legal system, spousal-abuse awareness 
and disputes over the Fourth Amendment. We wonder what happened to the American 
hero. He will always have his loyal fans and supporters; his Heisman trophy 
will never be taken away; yet nothing can deny the fact that he is a murder 
suspect.  
</P>
<P>
 He is the perfect example of a man turned into myth. News of the case sent us 
reeling, with most of us in disbelief and with hope in our hearts that he is 
innocent. He was a paradigm of excellence, which crumbled after we found out he 
was a person, too. 
</P>
<P>
 We all have our ideals, which seem to manifest themselves in our personal 
heroes. Yet they are the same as we are: human beings. As we recognize this, it 
becomes the more difficult to see them as idols. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why we need to search within ourselves for our heroes.

GRASS-ROOTS SCENE IS FERTILE, BUT DROUGHT'S COMING; POP MUSIC: OFFSPRING HAS A 
SMASH WITH 'SMASH,' BUT COSTA MESA CLUB OUR HOUSE IS CLOSING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The national success of the Offspring, whose "Smash" album has lived up to its 
name by cracking the Top 20 on the Billboard pop chart, represents a new 
breakthrough for Orange County's grass-roots rock scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, back on the home front it's business as usual: Another 
promising alternative-music venue on the chronically anemic club scene is about 
to fold. 
</P>
<P>
 After eight months of adventurous bookings of local bands and touring 
underground acts, Our House in Costa Mesa will cease its regular concert 
programming at the end of this month. The club's independent promoter, Chris 
Fahey, said there may be occasional concerts at Our House in the future, but 
nothing approaching the schedule that had seen one to three shows a week at the 
182-capacity club at 720 W. 19th St. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, Fahey said, is that Our House's daytime operation as a 
coffeehouse and restaurant stopped a few months ago, and the owner, the Wahoo's 
Fish Taco chain, will no longer provide staff on concert nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Fahey said that his own company, Stab You in the Back Productions, is 
basically a two-man operation (with partner Mike Torribo) and can't muster 
enough staff on its own to run regular shows. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fahey said he hopes the types of acts he has booked -- among them Drive Like 
Jehu, Claw Hammer, the Muffs and John Doe -- will find a place at the Foothill 
in Signal Hill, where veteran promoter Steve Zepeda is now booking alternative 
and roots-rock concerts on Thursday and Friday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure he'll see a lot more of the touring bands we've been splitting up," 
Fahey said. "Now everybody's got to drive to Long Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining shows at Our House are: the Women, the Meices, Sasabe Giants and 
South Bay Surfers, Aug. 13; Fluf, Loraine and the Summer Hits, Aug. 19; Claw 
Hammer, Custom Floor, Tanner and Grasshopper, Aug. 20, and aMiniature and No 
Knife, Aug. 26. All shows are for ages 21 and up and cost $4 or $5, except for 
the Fluf concert, which is open to all ages and costs $8.

SOFTWARE REVIEW; FILLING SUMMER DAYS; A VARIETY OF WELL-DESIGNED COMPUTER GAMES 
AND ADVENTURES CAN EDUCATE AND ENTERTAIN CHILDREN AND GIVE THEIR PARENTS A 
BREAK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Summer lasts 94 days, from June 21 through Sept. 22. For mothers with 
preschoolers at home, it's twice that long. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because children 3 to 5 can bend the laws of relativity. Time slows 
down when it's punc tuated every 60 seconds by calls for food, entertainment 
and grooming service. 
</P>
<P>
 Legos, crayons, train sets and the rest were invented for mothers, to give 
them a break during the long stretch from June to September. Now computers have 
been added to the maternal arsenal. But what can a 3-year-old do on a computer? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is: quite a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Putt-Putt Goes to the Moon" (Humongous Entertainment, $54.95) is the latest 
in a line of spectacularly well-designed adventures for tots. (The other titles 
are "Putt-Putt Joins the Parade," "Fatty Bear's Birthday Surprise" and "Fatty 
Bear's Funpack.") With beautiful cartoon screens and droll "hot spots" (click 
and something silly happens), these games create a seamless world kids can 
explore and control. Most kids prefer Putt-Putt to Fatty Bear. Older kids (5) 
will be able to solve the games' central problems, but even 3-year-olds can 
wander happily. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Playroom" (Broderbund, $37.50) has won awards from educators and 
parents' groups for treating kids' minds with respect while giving them a 
delightful introduction to computer power. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Backyard" (Broderbund, $35). This sequel to "The Playroom," shares its 
design brio and is chock full of loopy surprises. An array of nature lessons 
are gleaned from scrutiny of an ordinary back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 * "A.J.'s World of Discovery" (Bright Star, $49.94) is one of the best-kept 
secrets on the children's computer scene: clever, cunningly designed, powerful 
and full of waggish animations. (Bonus: Inexpensive add-on curriculum diskettes 
are available when kids are ready to acquire elementary-school skills.) 
</P>
<P>
 * "Scooter's Magic Castle" (EAKids, $49.95). In Scooter's enchanted and varied 
world there's always something new to discover. Parents and kids rave about 
Scooter. Even after a year kids can root out another secret or two from within 
this meticulously crafted entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Thinkin' Things" (Edmark, $59.95). A distinguished manufacturer of early 
curriculum software designed this charming exploration game, which includes 
simple music, design and problem-solving activities. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Tuneland" (7th Level, $49.95). Howie Mandel's voice enlivens this CD-ROM 
flight of whimsy, accessible to anyone with enough dexterity to click a mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Mixed-Up Mother Goose" (Sierra, $29.95 diskette; $39.95 CD-ROM). Children 
help characters from their favorite nursery rhymes complete tasks. (Give Jack 
and Jill a pail and they can run up the hill and fetch a pail of water, etc.) 
Challenging for 3-year-olds, it's a great introduction for kids 4 and older to 
the new breed of problem-solving computer games that will loom large in our 
kids' futures. COMPUTER ART CENTERS 
</P>
<P>
 Computer Art Centers' open-ended play makes them ideal brain-building fun. And 
for Moms, no-mess art has got to rank up there with the invention of fire as a 
milestone toward civilized living. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crayola Amazing Art Adventure" (Micrografx, $59.95) is the latest addition to 
the growing field of computer creativity tools. Easy to use, it includes, 
besides the basic canvas with umpteen million gorgeous colors, a coloring book, 
dot-to-dot puzzles, paint-by-numbers, draw-and-fill features and wonderful 
sound effects. With some special drawing tools (a "crazy line" maker, a rainbow 
fill option and 16 "magic effects"), plus 60 animations, it's as feature-packed 
as they get. However, it demands powerful hardware to run satisfactorily. 
</P>
<P>
 Another new arrival is "Colorforms Computer Fun Set" (Gryphon Software, 
$49.00). For Mac only, it's a good choice for youngest mouse-clickers because 
of its simplicity. Besides the canvas it's got copious stickers and background 
scenes. These allow anyone, regardless of drafting ability or hand-eye 
coordination, to create satisfying artworks. Also for Mac, the more powerful 
"EAKids Art Center" (Electronic Arts, $49.95), is a superb creativity kit that 
will satisfy older kids while working just fine for toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
 The classic art center is "Kid Pix" which has now been upgraded to the more 
powerful "Kid Pix 2" (Broderbund, $44.95). The granddaddy of this genre for 
home PC, it will run on older PCs yet remains an elegantly designed tool full 
of up-to-date surprises: silly sound effects, "hidden pictures" (revealed like 
gravestone rubbings), stamps and a coloring book. A companion to it is 
Broderbund's "Kid Cuts" ($44.95), which requires a printer and offers a variety 
of cutouts and construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
 How many games does a preschooler need? (At these prices, whatever Mom and Dad 
can afford, and be grateful for it!) The nonprofit educational newsletter 
Children's Software Review recommends 10 games altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 It may take a while to acquire that many. After collecting a few games, IBM 
and compatible users with four megabytes of RAM or more will want to install 
"KidDesk" (Edmark, $39.95). With "KidDesk" pre-readers can run their programs 
from a screen of icons, without waiting for Mom or Dad to enter commands.

COVER STORY; SUPER SELECTION; AS INTEREST IN COMIC BOOKS HAS INCREASED, SO HAS 
THE NUMBER OF STORES SELLING THEM. THE VALLEY IS HOME TO MORE THAN TWO DOZEN, 
MANY OF WHICH OFFER DISCOUNTS, SALES AND MEMBERSHIPS TO ATTRACT REPEAT 
BUSINESS.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Comic books are big business these days. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 * A Sotheby's auction of rare comic art in New York brought in a record $1.7 
million in June, with the first comic book appearances of Superman and Batman 
fetching nearly $55,000 and $49,000, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 * According to Jesse Leon McCann, customer service representative for Diamond 
Comic Distributors' Los Angeles outlet, a staggering 600 to 800 individual 
comic book titles are published each month. 
</P>
<P>
 * And today through Sunday, tens of thousands of fans will converge on the San 
Diego Comic Con, one of the nation's largest annual comic book conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no surprise, then, that as interest in comics has increased, so have the 
number of stores that sell them. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Over 50 Years of American Comic Books," writer Ron Goulart notes that 
although comic books had been sold for many years through the head shops and 
used record stores of the 1960s and '70s counterculture, stores devoted to 
comics didn't appear in significant numbers until the mid-1970s, when retailers 
were able to bypass wholesalers and deal directly with publishers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it looks like every time you turn around, there's a comic book store," 
says lifelong comics reader Todd Chodorow, 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the San Fernando Valley is home to more than two dozen shops devoted to 
comics and related merchandise -- a competition that has inspired many stores 
to offer discounts, sales and memberships to attract repeat business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the service that's going to sell you on a place," Chodorow says. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite comics' growing market and the proliferation of "mature" -- the 
comic book equivalent of an R rating -- and pornographic titles, some argue 
that much of the industry's output remains rooted in timeworn formulas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market has gotten really, really big," says Joe Masset of Forbidden 
Planet in Sherman Oaks. "It just hasn't gotten all that broad. Comic book 
publishers are still trying to sell superhero books." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, despite the explosion of titles and publishers over the last few 
years, most comics still star costumed superheroes and comic readers remain 
largely male. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of women don't like (comics) because of the way women are portrayed," 
says Rosa Thwett, co-owner of Comic Asylum in West Hills. The opinion is shared 
by most retailers, who note that women generally account for only a fraction of 
their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 There are exceptions, such as 24-year-old Lisa Nelson of Glendale, who spends 
nearly $30 a week on Japanese animation videos and Japanese comics, known as 
manga. According to Nelson, the science fiction-heavy Japanese comics tend to 
feature stronger women. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, the female characters in American comic books are just kind of 
hokey," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, comics are evolving, and so are the stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's because the audience has changed," McCann says. "The way comic book 
stores have changed is the way that readers have changed." 
</P>
<P>
 No longer the domain of the after-school crowd, today's comic book store draws 
everyone from preteen "Spider-Man" and "Batman" readers to adults lured by 
moody, sophisticated titles such as DC Comics' "Sandman." 
</P>
<P>
 In response, many retailers have expanded their merchandise beyond the typical 
$2 comic book to include T-shirts, posters, model kits, trading cards and 
graphic novels -- softcover books with original and reprinted comics material. 
And while many shop owners see them as a passing fad, most are now carrying 
Pogs, those whackable discs that have gripped the grade-school crowd.  
</P>
<P>
 Says Charles Pira of Pee Wee Comics: "I don't think a store can survive just 
on comics nowadays." 
</P>
<P>
 The following is a non-inclusive list of Valley comic book shops, from 
successful veterans to lesser-known newcomers, with an emphasis on the products 
and services that make each unique. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Art of Collecting, 6100 Laurel Canyon Blvd., at the Laurel Plaza Mall, 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 When an earthquake shuts your doors for two months, what do you do? Conduct 
business in the parking lot! And so it went for this shop, located on the 
outside of the quake-battered mall. The store is open again, but the mall 
remains closed, its future cloudy. Employee David Wilhite, 27, says Laurel 
Plaza's closure means "a lot less traffic" nowadays, but the store does offer a 
15% discount on new comics with the purchase of a $10 yearly membership. 
Members can also earn "bargain bucks" toward the purchase of back issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Mondays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sundays. 
(818) 766-5604.  
</P>
<P>
 * Brave New World, 21048 Devonshire St., Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Opened just over a year ago, Brave New World sells every major comic as well 
as model kits, paperbacks, posters, T-shirts and old magazines such as Mad. 
"We're pretty diverse in what we get," says assistant manager Don Heinsberg, 
25. They also carry mature titles, although you have to ask for them at the 
counter. Like many shops, they also invite the occasional comics professional 
for in-store appearances. Later this month, former "Justice League" penciler 
Adam Hughes will visit the Chatsworth store and its older twin in Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth hours: 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Mondays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 9 
p.m. Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Sundays. (818) 341-2170.  
</P>
<P>
 * A Collector's Dream, 21222 Ventura Blvd., Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The store's small floor plan looks something like a studio apartment, and 
perhaps that's appropriate since owner Mike Frank spends virtually all his time 
there. "July 4th was my second day off this year," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelves are stocked with a good number of comics from most major 
publishers. For serious collectors, Frank runs an investment program where 
he'll select $25 worth of comics each month that he believes will increase in 
value. "I want to make my living but I don't want to gouge anybody," says 
Frank, 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays, noon to 6 p.m. Sundays. 
(818) 992-1636.  
</P>
<P>
 * Comic Asylum, 22807 1/2 Saticoy St., West Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Catering mostly to kids and teen-agers, Comic Asylum sticks to mainstream 
comics, trading cards and Pogs -- avoiding such higher-priced items as graphic 
novels. "We don't carry off-the-wall kind of stuff," says co-owner Thwett, 24. 
For collectors and investors, the store maintains a bidding wall where 
customers can bring in their comics for weekly, sealed-bid auctions. In 
addition, Pog tournaments are held every Sunday, drawing as many as 50 young 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: noon to 7 p.m. Mondays through Wednesdays, noon to 8 p.m. Thursdays 
through Saturdays, noon to 6 p.m. Sundays. (818) 888-2756.  
</P>
<P>
 * Comic City, 6633 Fallbrook Ave., in the Fallbrook Mall, West Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 This brand-new store, like its twin in the Sherman Oaks Galleria, caters 
primarily to kids and teen-agers, says co-owner Greg Schiffman, 25. Although 
they don't carry the weekly selection of new comics, back issues line the walls 
and the store does a brisk business in Pogs. According to Schiffman, the mall 
provides a wide range of customers, with parents and children often browsing 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people want to shop where they feel comfortable," he says. The 
store's name may change after Schiffman resolves some business matters with his 
partner, but you can find it next to Foot Locker. 
</P>
<P>
 West Hills hours: 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 7 
p.m. Sundays. (818) 313-9182.  
</P>
<P>
 * Comic Jungle, 8925 Sepulveda Blvd., North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager George Marquez, 24, says the store specializes in popular, mainstream 
comics, trading cards, toys and Pogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a lot more knowledgeable about what they sell," says customer Nathan 
Storey, a 20-year comics reader. 
</P>
<P>
 With every $5 purchase, customers are entered in a monthly drawing for a 
current "hot" comic. Marquez, who speaks some Spanish, says he also tries to 
attract customers from the neighborhood's Latino population -- a demographic 
largely unserved by Valley comic shops. "A lot of people forget that there's a 
potential market for them," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: noon to 7 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays, noon to 8 p.m. Fridays, 11 
a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sundays. (818) 893-4487.  
</P>
<P>
 * Comic Odyssey, 8238 Tampa Ave., Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 A clean, well-lit store with a good selection of comics, graphic novels and 
toys, Comic Odyssey has something for all readers. With sister shops in 
Panorama City and Simi Valley, owner Sandy Sansolis, 25, says he tries to serve 
"hard-core collectors" while encouraging new readers to enjoy comics as a 
hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he recognizes that comics fans are notoriously fickle, driven from one 
fad to the next. "If I had Power Rangers, I'd be rich," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 Reseda hours: 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturdays through Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 8 
p.m. Thursdays and Fridays. (818) 341-9630.  
</P>
<P>
 * Continental Comics, 17032 Devonshire St., Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the Jan. 17 quake knocked most of this store's shelves down, but it also 
toppled an interior wall, making the place a bit bigger in the process. Back 
issues are still kept behind the counter -- "to keep 'em in better shape," says 
assistant manager Mike Garanchon, 25 -- but the selection is extensive. At 17 
years old, Continental is one of the older Valley comic book shops.  
</P>
<P>
 "We try to keep everything rather lively," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The store carries a variety of mainstream and esoteric titles, as well as 
Japanese animation videos, trading cards and toys.  
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 11:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Mondays through Wednesdays, 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sundays. 
(818) 368-8909.  
</P>
<P>
 * Emerald City, 1802 W. Olive Ave., Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 There's something spooky going on here. Maybe it's the creepy models of 
monsters and ghouls scattered throughout the small shop, their sightless eyes 
peering over your shoulder as you browse.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're almost like an anti-comic store," says owner Taylor White, 32. "We 
cater more toward the old monster crowd."  
</P>
<P>
 Although you'll find the latest comics from most major publishers, the store 
also has a large selection of vintage monster magazines and fanzines targeted 
to sci-fi and fantasy buffs and every stripe of collector. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gone out of our way to make this a much different store," White says. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Mondays, Tuesdays and Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
Wednesdays through Fridays. Closed Sundays. (818) 842-9383.  
</P>
<P>
 * The Flip Side, 18551 Ventura Blvd., Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 Started six years ago in Canoga Park as a used record store with comics, the 
Flip Side now boasts an impressive number of comics titles as well as movie 
posters, paperbacks, trading cards, Pogs and magazines at its 3,000-square-foot 
location. "We wanted to be able to offer customers a wide variety of products," 
says co-owner Derth Obbink, 49. 
</P>
<P>
 The used records and compact discs are still there, offering shoppers unique 
bartering opportunities. "People can trade records for comics or comics for 
records," Obbink says. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Fridays 
and Saturdays, noon to 6 p.m. Sundays. (818) 758-9103.  
</P>
<P>
 * Forbidden Planet, 14513 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 A worldwide chain of independently owned comics, science-fiction and fantasy 
stores, Forbidden Planet sells a large variety of comics merchandise in the 
back of its neat and clean Valley store behind rows of sci-fi books. There are 
titles from nearly all publishers to choose from; employees will take the time 
to point out comics that match customers' interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Manager Joe Masset, 34, says: "I want people to explore them and 
find the thing they like best." 
</P>
<P>
 On the sci-fi side, the store frequently invites such authors as Ray Bradbury, 
Greg Bear, Clive Barker and William Gibson for book signings. 
</P>

 Hours: 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sundays, Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 
9 p.m. Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. (818) 995-0151.

 * Future Frontier Comics & Collectibles, 8205 Woodman Ave., Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime DC Comics writer Marv Wolfman is a partner in this modest shop, 
although he's not involved with Future Frontier's sister store in the Santa 
Clarita Valley. The store offers a good selection of mainstream comics and 
comics industry magazines, as well as some trading cards and Pogs. Manager 
Craig Stone says the shop also has monthly sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can sit here and talk about comics all day," Stone, 21, says of regular 
customers. "I don't care if I sold 'em a book." 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily. (818) 908-1216.  
</P>
<P>
 * Golden Apple, 8962 Reseda Blvd., Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of a three-store chain that began with its popular Hollywood location, 
Golden Apple packs a lot into its small Valley shop -- comics, graphic novels, 
toys, trading cards, videos and more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pretty much get everything we can," says employee Pat Morgan, 24. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection is good, with titles from nearly every publisher available on 
the racks, including "Flaxen," a comic book starring Golden Apple's mascot -- a 
mousy nurse who transforms into a buxom superhero. They also maintain a 24-hour 
hot line at (213) 651-0455 that lists current comics and in-store happenings. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge hours: 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays, noon to 5 p.m. 
Sundays. (818) 993-7804.  
</P>
<P>
 * Heroes, 1918 W. Olive Ave., Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 A few blocks from Emerald City, Heroes is a more traditional comics shop, 
offering the latest titles from mainstream publishers, as well as action 
figures, posters and a huge selection of non-sports cards. Owner Jake Hagopian, 
26, also carries gift items. Indeed, what better present for a science 
fiction-lovin' Dad than a "Star Trek" necktie? 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: noon to 7 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Fridays, 10 
a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sundays. (818) 562-1900.  
</P>
<P>
 * Heroes & Legends, 5879 Kanan Road, Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Located a bit farther down the road from its previous Kanan Road location, 
Heroes & Legends now shares a mini-mall unit with a video rental store. 
Although new comics and back issues are available, the store concentrates more 
on Hollywood and sports memorabilia, says employee Corey Goldstein, 32. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so many new titles, it's overwhelming," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with current trends, the shop also sells several varieties of 
trading cards and Pogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. (818) 991-5979.  
</P>
<P>
 * Komic Con, 11824 Ventura Blvd., Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Formerly Comic Kingdom, the store and its counterpart in Granada Hills are 
under new management. The selection leans mostly to mainstream comics, although 
trading cards and inexpensive Pogs are also for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 According to employee Cat Jercan, 26, the store is willing to bargain with 
customers to keep them coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to be cheap with everything," he says. "If I have to break even, I will 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Comic Asylum, the store also has weekly Pog tournaments for kids 14 and 
younger. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Mondays through Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
Thursdays through Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sundays. (818) 761-3753.  
</P>
<P>
 * Komic Kid, 6800 Balboa Blvd., Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking isn't great and there's very little breathing room inside, but the 
3-year-old shop is often buzzing with activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of energy," says manager Linda Fougere, 43. 
</P>
<P>
 All major titles are here, as well as every variety of non-sports trading 
cards. And with every $5 purchase, customers are entered in a weekly raffle of 
store merchandise. And parents, if you're on the hunt for "Power Rangers" toys, 
this is the place to come. But be sure to bring your wallet, since the rarities 
aren't cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: noon to 8 p.m. Mondays through Fridays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturdays and 
Sundays. (818) 997-0289.  
</P>
<P>
 * Pee Wee Comics, 7520 Topanga Canyon Blvd., Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Another veteran Valley store, Pee Wee began in 1984 and has since opened shops 
in Agoura Hills and Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to start a store that I'd be comfortable with as a customer," says 
co-owner Charles Pira, 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the store expanded its merchandise line to include toys, 
magazines, T-shirts and collectibles, but as Pira explains, "our biggest push 
is customer service." 
</P>
<P>
 Pee Wee has frequent sales, such as its annual Thanksgiving Day blowout, when 
customers are treated to pie, milk and coffee, and all comics are half off. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 12:30 to 7 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Fridays, 
10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturdays, noon to 5 p.m. Sundays. (818) 348-2083.  
</P>
<P>
 * Shooting Star Comics & Games, 618 E. Colorado Blvd., Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the store with everything -- and 2,000 square feet to hold it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a much wider selection," says Sam Silbert, the store's 28-year-old 
owner. "We carry the full lines -- dozens of companies and a lot of the small 
ones." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the store maintains one of the largest collections of graphic novels 
from publishers large and small, in addition to a wide selection of Japanese 
comics and videos. On the game front, the store carries a sizable number of 
fantasy role-playing products, but no Pogs. "We're out of the Pog business, 
thank God," Silbert says with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: noon to 7 p.m. daily. (818) 502-1535.  
</P>
<P>
 * Things From Another World, 1000 Universal Center Drive, at the Universal 
CityWalk, Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a very big store, but clean, bright and stocked with comics and graphic 
novels from most major publishers, as well as toys, models, books and other 
memorabilia related to such sci-fi mainstays as "Star Trek" and "Star Wars." 
</P>
<P>
 "We tend to carry more trendy, unusual items," says manager Barbara Lubbers, 
35. "The staff is geared to talk to the customers and show 'em what we have." 
</P>
<P>
 And although they don't sell back issues in the traditional sense, there are 
usually a few months worth of each comic at cover price. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Sundays through Thursdays, 11 a.m. to midnight 
Fridays and Saturdays. (818) 622-8464.
