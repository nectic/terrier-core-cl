KING/DREW'S DOCTOR TRAINING PROGRAM OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An accrediting agency that had threatened to shut down a training program for 
young emergency physicians at the Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center 
has instead granted the program full approval, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education unconditionally 
approved the program after the medical center pledged to hire eight additional 
emergency medicine specialists to supervise 42 resident physicians who provide 
the bulk of the patient care in the county hospital's busy emergency room and 
trauma center. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Reed Tuckson, president of Drew University, said he was very pleased with 
the decision. He said teamwork by the university, hospital and county officials 
helped resolve the accreditors' major concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Gray, director of hospitals for the Department of Health Services, said 
the vital program was saved partly by a personal visit that top medical center 
officials paid to accreditors in Chicago. Gray said the officials from the 
hospital emphasized the hospital's important mission and outlined their efforts 
to comply with accrediting standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The county-operated hospital near Watts serves mostly the poor and uninsured, 
including a high percentage of gunshot victims and trauma patients. The 
emergency department is the hospital's hub, accounting for about 78% of all 
patients who are admitted.  
</P>
<P>
 The agency last year criticized the inadequate supervision of residents in the 
emergency department, noting that only one senior physician was required to 
supervise patient care at night and on weekends. Two senior physicians 
typically worked the day shift. Resident physicians told accreditors they 
consult the supervising physician on only a couple of cases each shift. "In a 
facility with 65,000 visits, this is inadequate supervision," the report said.  
</P>
<P>
 The hiring of additional senior doctors, who are working as independent 
contractors instead of Civil Service county employees, has enabled the hospital 
to assign two senior physicians instead of one to supervise emergency patient 
care from 7 a.m. to midnight most days. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital also moved to replace the chairman of the emergency department, 
Dr. William Shoemaker, with an emergency specialist from County-USC Medical 
Center, Dr. H. Range Hutson, who is being paid $120,000 for a six-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shoemaker protested his removal, sued for reinstatement and won a 
preliminary injunction blocking his demotion. The hospital so far has not 
reinstated him. Shoemaker's attorney, Rees Lloyd, is seeking to hold medical 
center officials in contempt. 
</P>
<P>
 The accreditation council put the emergency medicine training program on 
probation three years ago, and in November threatened to revoke its 
accreditation. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray said seven emergency medicine specialists have been hired, including 
Hutson, and an eighth is being recruited. He said the new doctors will work a 
minimum of 48 hours a week, devoting at least 65% of their time to the 
supervision of patient care. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that five new doctors are scheduled to work shifts in the 
emergency room this month. They are typically scheduled to work only two or 
three eight-hour shifts a week. Gray said the rest of the time they will 
perform administrative work or tend to other responsibilities.

JOB ACTION BY POLICE TARGETS L.A. TOURISM; LABOR: IF WAGE DISPUTE IS NOT 
SETTLED SOON, UNION SAYS IT WILL DISTRIBUTE TO TRAVEL OFFICIALS A VIDEOTAPE 
PORTRAYING THE CITY AS CRIME-RIDDEN. OFFICERS HAVE GONE 20 MONTHS WITHOUT A 
CONTRACT. 
</P>

<P>
 Threatening to tarnish the city's reputation as a tourist destination, the 
union for Los Angeles police officers said Tuesday that unless its contract 
dispute is settled soon it will distribute a videotape to travel and convention 
officials that shows Los Angeles to be a crime-ridden area. 
</P>
<P>
 The videotape will highlight the declining morale among LAPD officers, who 
have worked without a contract for 20 months. It will use riot footage and 
statistics indicating that crime is rampant, union officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat by the Police Protective League comes in advance of this summer's 
World Cup soccer competition, as well as a series of large national 
conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you, the leaders of this city, cannot make us your No. 1 priority as you 
have been telling the public in your rhetoric, then we will clearly demonstrate 
that we can impact the very source of our dispute, the city treasury," union 
President Danny Staggs told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat is part of a series of job actions the union has initiated in 
recent months to try to force the city to grant the first pay raise for 
officers since July, 1991. The union represents 7,500 officers, ranked 
lieutenant and below. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, police officers picketed outside City Hall and later called a "blue 
flu" in which hundreds of rank-and-file officers called in sick to protest the 
stalled contract talks. The sickout lasted a single day before a judge ordered 
the officers back to work. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest action, Staggs insisted that the union is not bluffing, saying 
it has begun preparing the videotape and an accompanying brochure for release 
to convention planners, tourist agencies, trade publications and consulates 
located in Los Angeles. Staggs did not indicate to the council when the 
videotapes might go out. 
</P>
<P>
 In City Hall, some of those sympathetic to the officers' cause said they 
understand the union's frustration and hope an agreement will be reached before 
the videotape is distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years now they've put their neck on the line," said Councilman Joel 
Wachs, who is pushing for a pay raise for officers. "They go out there and work 
their tails off and they don't get anything. They're frustrated and I 
understand their frustration." 
</P>
<P>
 But others criticized the union's tactic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Serious negotiating belongs at the bargaining table, not in tactics such as 
this," Mayor Richard Riordan said in a statement. "I hope that, upon 
reflection, the union will reconsider this tactic." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky compared the union's threat to a scene from the 
movie "Blazing Saddles." 
</P>
<P>
 "They are basically holding a gun to their own head and to the city's head and 
saying, 'If you don't do what we want, we'll pull the trigger,' " Yaroslavsky 
said. "In the end who gets hurt by that?" 
</P>
<P>
 The next negotiating session is set for Thursday. The police union is 
insisting on a salary increase comparable to the 9% raise over four years that 
workers at the Department of Water and Power received last fall after going on 
strike. City officials contend that the budget situation is too grim for an 
immediate raise. 
</P>
<P>
 The tactic the police union is employing is not without precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the Los Angeles Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union Local 11 mailed 
out 2,500 copies of a video called "City on the Edge" that contrasted positive 
images of Los Angeles -- wide beaches, glitzy shops and luxurious hotels -- 
with scenes of poverty, violence and desperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the controversial tape was distributed, the union settled its 
contract with hotel owners.

A $7-MILLION ORDER; PIZZA MAKER TASTES VICTORY AFTER SUING INSURANCE FIRM OVER 
RIOT LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Dennis Stephan may soon be rolling in dough. 
</P>
<P>
 And we're not talking about the pasty base to that Pepperoni and Sausage 
Deluxe that he was happily flipping in the air Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 33-year-old Willowbrook pizza maker was wearing an ear-to-ear grin because 
of a $7-million verdict he has won against an insurance company that failed to 
honor its policy after his Domino's Pizza outlet was destroyed in the 1992 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the $225,000 in coverage that he thought he would be paid for his 
store in a gutted strip mall, Stephan was offered a $20,000 settlement by the 
Philadelpia-based Insurance Company of North America. 
</P>
<P>
 In the superheated fast-food business, that's barely enough to replace a 
single oven -- not a computerized, stainless steel-and-tile high-speed kitchen 
capable of cranking out a pizza-to-go every 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, parts of Stephan's life were starting to topple like dominoes. 
</P>
<P>
 He had to permanently lay off his 20 employees at the wrecked store at 643 E. 
El Segundo Blvd. Then he started falling behind on bills at the two other pizza 
outlets he runs in neighboring Carson. As he tottered on the brink of closing 
them too, the bank foreclosed on his family's home in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a pizza man, not a lawyer," Stephan says. But when the insurance company 
stubbornly ignored his protests that the policy number on the settlement offer 
was mysteriously different from that on his pre-riot insurance certificate, he 
sued. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After a 2 1/2-week trial in Los Angeles that ended last week, a jury awarded 
Stephan $249,416 in compensatory damages and another $6.5 million in punitive 
damages. Legal experts say the judgment is the largest of its type to emerge 
from the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody should have to go through what I've been through," Stephan said, 
taking a breather at one of his Carson outlets after positioning pepperoni, 
sausage, green peppers, onions and mushrooms on the Deluxe and whipping it onto 
the oven conveyor belt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't describe what it felt like when my livelihood went up in smoke. And I 
can't describe what it was like afterward -- my insurance company put me 
through hell." 
</P>
<P>
 On April 30, 1992, Stephan was watching television when his burning store 
flashed on the screen. But it was his future that flashed before him 12 days 
later when the insurance company rejected his claim. 
</P>
<P>
 He tried to employ his Willowbrook workers at the Carson stores, but soon 
those outlets were in jeopardy too. With his cash flow cut by a third, Stephan 
rapidly fell behind in paying his landlords, the utility companies and the 
vendors who supply him with pizza ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 He was about $200,000 behind in his business bills when the bank foreclosed on 
his Redondo Beach home. Stephan, his wife, Josie, and their 6-month-old son, 
Jacob, have been ordered out by the end of next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill collectors are calling constantly, every day," said Stephan's 
35-year-old brother, Norm, who works as business manager for the franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Stephan's lawyer, Stephen L. Thomas of West Los Angeles: "He's been 
absolutely destitute. It's taken a lot of grit to hold on when he didn't really 
have the wherewithal to hold on." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the insurance company did not return calls Tuesday. But the case 
is not yet over, said Mike Krill, whose staff acted as agents for Insurance 
Company of North America. He has been ordered to pay a $249,000 share of the 
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are certain that the verdict is not justified," said Krill, president of 
an insurance agency in Northern California. "We hope that further legal 
proceedings will correct the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephan said he is not worried about an appeal. And he vowed that becoming an 
instant millionaire will not change him. 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to invest his award in new Domino's outlets in the 
Compton-Carson-Willowbrook area. "I want to help rebuild L.A. while I rebuild 
myself," he said.

PUBLIC'S DEMAND FOR PEPPER SPRAY IS BIGGER THAN SUPPLY IN L.A. AREA; 
SELF-DEFENSE: MANY STORES ARE AWAITING SHIPMENTS FROM DISTRIBUTORS OR STATE 
AUTHORIZATION. MORE PRODUCT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE NEXT WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 During the past year, Susan Morrow has purchased the three items she considers 
necessary for survival in Los Angeles: a 9-millimeter pistol that she keeps 
under her bed, a stun gun that she carries in her car and a brass whistle that 
she keeps on her key ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow had hoped to add pepper spray to her arsenal Tuesday, the first day the 
spray was made available to the public in California. 
</P>
<P>
 She called gun stores. She called shooting ranges. She called self-defense 
firms. But no one she contacted said they were selling the spray. Finally, she 
called a newspaper office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been waiting months for this. Where," she asked, a hint of desperation 
in her voice, "can I get some pepper spray today?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although California stores were authorized to make the pepper spray available 
Tuesday, many stores were waiting for their shipments from the distributor. 
Others were waiting for state workers to inspect their businesses and authorize 
them to sell the product. 
</P>
<P>
 Most gun shops and self-defense firms said they would not be able to sell the 
pepper spray until later in the week or early next week. The few who were able 
to sell the spray Tuesday were deluged with customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting so many calls we can't get everyone in . . . right away," said 
Milo  
</P>
<P>
 Speriglio, director of the Nick Harris Detective Academy. "We even got a call 
from a video company that wants the spray for all their employees." 
</P>
<P>
 California joins 47 states that allow pepper spray for self-defense. Still, 
there is some controversy over its use. The American Civil Liberties Union has 
criticized making the spray available to the public, calling for more research 
on its safety and reliability.  
</P>
<P>
 "We'd love to have a magic bullet that would save lives and not cause injury," 
said Mary Tokita, director of media relations for the ACLU's Los Angeles office 
"But this isn't it. There are a number of questions that need to be answered. 
Using the public as guinea pigs isn't a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Although a number of suspects exposed to pepper spray during arrests have died 
in custody, "we think it's probably coincidental," said David Boyd, a director 
for the National Institute of Justice, which is conducting an extensive study 
on the substance. In only one case has a medical examiner attributed pepper 
spray to the fatality, Boyd said. And it is questionable whether the spray was 
the direct cause of death in that case, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepper spray will incapacitate a suspect -- "to the extent that they are 
forced to their knees" -- about 90% of the time, Boyd said. But even in those 
cases where suspects, usually those who are mentally deranged or under the 
influence of drugs, are not fully incapacitated, the spray can be effective. 
They still must close their eyes for several minutes, Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tear gas, he said, is much less reliable. Tear gas has a tendency to vaporize, 
and a cloud of the gas can drift back onto the user. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Steve Wilkinson of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has been 
impressed with the results of the spray during its use in the field the past 
two years. He recalled a recent family disturbance in South-Central Los Angeles 
where a combative, unruly suspect threatened officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "After he was sprayed, he immediately went to his knees, and we walked around 
and handcuffed him with no resistance," said Wilkinson, who also has a weapons 
instruction business and plans to soon begin selling pepper spray. "The pain is 
so intense, the suspects don't want to do anything except go along with the 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 Oleoresin capsicum, the scientific name of the substance, is a pepper extract 
in an oil base that sticks to the eyes, nose and mouth. The spray has a 
blinding and choking effect and overpowers a person with a burning sensation 
that makes breathing difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the only variety of pepper spray that dealers are authorized to sell 
was approved by the state two weeks ago, firms did not have much time to order 
shipments. Suppliers have been deluged by orders from more than 200 California 
firms. Dealers that do not have permits to sell tear gas now have to be cleared 
by state workers to sell the spray, a process that should be completed by the 
end of next week. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 approved retail outlets in the state -- 35 in the Los Angeles area 
-- will be selling pepper spray. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be much easier to obtain the spray than tear gas. In most cases, tear 
gas certification takes about two hours of training at a community college, law 
enforcement agency or weapons range. Applicants then have to visit a retail 
outlet to purchase the tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who want to obtain pepper spray can do it all at one location in about 
30 minutes. Applicants can either watch a 30-minute training video or take a 
30-question test and then demonstrate their ability to use the canisters. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have taken a Mace class must pay a $12 state certification fee to 
carry the spray; all others must pay $17. The cost of the spray is $15 to $20. 
</P>
<P>
 Herb Danner, an executive with Defense Technology Corp. of America, which 
manufactures the only variety of pepper spray authorized for use in California, 
has been sprayed more than 20 times -- voluntarily, for testing purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pain is excruciating . . . you don't want to know about it," he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WEST HILLS; SUSPECT 
SHOT BY POLICE IS IN SERIOUS CONDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A suspected burglar, shot by police after allegedly attempting to run over an 
officer who was trying to arrest him in West Hills, remained hospitalized 
Tuesday in serious condition, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 When his condition permits, Hootan Safaee, 18, will be booked for residential 
burglary and assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer, said Los Angeles 
Police Department spokesman Lt. John Dunkin.Safaee was being treated at Holy 
Cross Medical Center for a bullet wound in the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Plainclothes officers from the LAPD's elite anti-crime task force, known as 
COBRA, were conducting a surveillance operation Monday involving Safaee -- who 
they believed was a burglar in the West San Fernando Valley -- when they 
allegedly saw him burglarize a home about 4 p.m., Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers waited until the burglary was complete, then asked other officers 
to assist them in arresting Safaee as he left the scene in his car with an 
unidentified male passenger. Safaee put his car in reverse and accelerated, 
striking the officer, who fired one round at Safaee's car, police said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; DRAWINGS 
USED TO DESCRIBE MAN'S CASTRATION BY WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A doctor using anatomical drawings gave jurors a graphic description Tuesday 
of a man's castration by his wife, and a prosecutor said he would show that the 
woman acted after accusing her husband of infidelity. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty.Larry Longo said in an opening statement that Aurelia 
Macias, 35, cut off her husband's testicles with a large pair of scissors while 
he slept. The prosecutor said Aurelia Macias dialed 911 after the attack and 
told the operator: "I cut my husband's testicles out." 
</P>
<P>
 The wife, charged with felony mayhem in the Sept. 20, 1992, attack on Jaime 
Macias, sat with her head down staring at the counsel table as the first 
witness, Dr. Eric Robins, told of Jaime Macias' distress at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Nan Whitfield reserved until later in the trial her 
right to deliver an opening statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Longo said Macias was asleep in a drunken stupor after imbibing more than 16 
beers during a baptism party for a friend's child. During the party, Aurelia 
Macias accused her husband of infidelity, Longo said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the couple's 17-year-old son heard his father moaning, discovered his 
injuries and went with him to the hospital. He said the son was sent home and 
found one testicle, but it was too late to try reattachment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maciases have reunited and did not want the case tried. But Longo has 
vowed to convict Aurelia Macias, comparing the case to that of a battered wife 
who refuses to testify against her husband. Whitfield has said that Aurelia 
Macias was abused by her husband.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; LAPD HAS 
MADE STRIDES TOWARD REFORM, PANEL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the 2 1/2 years since a blue-ribbon commission made sweeping 
recommendations for reforming the Los Angeles Police Department, its leaders 
have made strides toward achieving some of the panel's recommendations but 
others remain stalled by budgetary shortfalls and other obstacles, commission 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Independent Commission -- widely known as the Christopher Commission for 
its co-chairman, Warren Christopher -- produced more than 100 proposals for 
reform. Among proposals yet to be enacted are creation of a computerized system 
for tracking problem officers, regular psychological testing and counseling for 
officers, and a new personnel evaluation system. But the LAPD has taken steps 
to improve background checks for incoming officers, among other reforms, 
officials said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: TAGGER, 17, SOUGHT IN 2 
KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 17-year-old member of a teen-age graffiti tagging crew was identified 
Tuesday by Los Angeles police as the prime suspect in two killings and two 
attempted murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they are seeking David Askew -- whose spray-paint-wielding clique 
goes by the initials "W.D.C" for "We Don't Care" -- in the four attacks, which 
occurred over the last four months. The crimes include the murder of a 
70-year-old Los Angeles man who was gunned down at his front door. 
</P>
<P>
 "David, . . . we're asking you to do the right thing and turn yourself in," 
said Deputy Police Chief Mark Kroeker. The crime spree, Kroeker said at a news 
conference, "has gone beyond the vandalism taggers normally do and has moved 
into a string of violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily, authorities withhold the names of juveniles accused of crimes. 
However, a judge permitted the release of Askew's name and photograph because 
of the number and severity of the crimes involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Askew and his family had lived near 50th and South Hoover streets and had 
owned a mini-mart in the neighborhood, but they recently sold the business and 
moved, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 Typically, taggers do not engage in violence. But Detectives Russell Poole and 
Carlos Velasquez said they believe Askew and his group were seeking more than 
the simple notoriety of a scrawled nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said the first of the four attacks occurred Nov. 12 when a 
South-Central man was gunned down in a drive-by shooting in the 5300 block of 
South Normandie Avenue. The man, who is recovering, told police that Askew shot 
him, detectives said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second incident came less than a week later, on Nov. 18, when Robert 
Hamilton Jr., 70, was robbed on the way home, police said. Hamilton, they said, 
had just been to the bank and withdrawn a large amount of cash when he was 
confronted by two men who robbed him at his front door. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton's daughter, Rosalind Parks, 30, said she, her husband and her two 
children, ages 11 and 3, were inside at the time of the robbery. They did not 
know what was happening, she said, until they heard the gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 On his deathbed, her father told her that one of the robbers -- identified by 
witnesses as Askew -- had demanded to be let into the house, Parks said. When 
Hamilton refused, she said, he was shot. He died Feb. 15 at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The third attack occurred Feb. 11 in Askew's home, authorities said. In the 
midst of an argument, Michael Harris, 28, was shot to death. Later, a witness 
to the killing also was shot but survived to identify Askew, police said. That 
man is on a life-support system. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about Askew's whereabouts is asked to contact the 
South Bureau homicide division at (213) 237-1310. SHAWN HUBLER

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: ESCAPE ATTEMPT GETS AID 
FROM A FRIEND -- AND A QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roy (JoJo) Ward Jr., a suspected killer and fugitive who staged an 
unsuccessful escape from the jail of the Lennox sheriff's station, apparently 
got help from two outside sources. 
</P>
<P>
 One: a Los Angeles gang member who authorities believe intentionally got 
himself arrested so he could smuggle a gun into the jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The other: the Northridge quake, which disrupted the department's automatic 
fingerprint identification system and led authorities to treat Ward like a 
simple run-of-the-mill drug dealer instead of a dangerous escape artist. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until later that investigators learned that Ward, 24, was wanted by 
federal authorities for a variety of charges, including staging a daring 
Thanksgiving weekend breakout from a Shreveport, La., jail with the aid of a 
gun hidden inside a turkey dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy is a dangerous man," said Capt. Jack Scully, commander of the Lennox 
station. "I have no doubt he will try to escape again." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward was arrested Wednesday in the Athens district by deputies who said they 
discovered about a pound of cocaine in his car. He produced a driver's license 
in the name of Sam Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies did not know that "Sam Hall" was Ward, a longtime Los Angeles gang 
member who had escaped from the California Youth Authority as a teen-ager and 
fled to Louisiana, where he served three years for manslaughter and was 
awaiting sentencing on federal weapons charges when he broke out last November. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ward was arrested on the cocaine possession charge last week, deputies 
took him to Lennox station, an aging facility that has five holding cells. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, sheriff's spokesman Deputy Larry Mead said, it would have taken 
only about an hour for a computer check of the fingerprints to reveal "Hall's" 
true identity. But since the Jan. 17 earthquake damaged the Hall of Justice, 
where the Sheriff's Department's fingerprint section is located, the department 
has had to use other agencies' computers to run fingerprint checks, sometimes 
taking days. 
</P>
<P>
 If they had known who Ward was, Scully said, he would have received special 
handling as a dangerous escape risk. As it was, he was put into a holding cell 
with other crime suspects. The holding cells are equipped with pay phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Scully said investigators are still trying to determine exactly what happened 
next. But they believe that Ward may have called outside contacts and arranged 
for a gang member named Damon Goff, 24, to smuggle a gun into the jail. 
</P>
<P>
 During the failed escape Friday morning, Scully said, Ward held a gun to the 
head of a jailer and pulled the trigger. The round did not go off. 
</P>
<P>
 Goff and Ward were arraigned Tuesday on charges of attempted murder, assault 
with a deadly weapon on a police officer and bringing a weapon into the jail.

 They're good role models even if they do drool in public: As part of its 
anti-drug effort, the U.S. Customs Service hands out trading cards celebrating 
its Hall of Fame of K-9 interdictors. The cards list phone numbers on the back 
that advise citizens how to report "suspicious activities." The hard-eyed 
hounds carry such menacing names as Marauder (Miami, Fla.), Champ (New 
Orleans), Desperado (Laredo, Tex.) and Sparky (Chicago). 
</P>
<P>
 All except the L.A. rep -- Muffin. 
</P>
<P>
 Just to help this town dispel its Lotus Land reputation, we wish Customs could 
have selected a cur with a more imposing name. Oh well. At least, Muffin's not 
a poodle.

 Urban Myth No. 5,212: It's linked to the earthquake, of course -- what isn't 
these days? The Times has heard from several callers who claim there's a 
conspiracy to hide the fact that the quake's magnitude was really 8.0. One 
caller quoted an unnamed structural engineer who said that only an 8.0 temblor 
could have inflicted the damage of the Northridge quake. And why the 
conspiracy? The unfounded rumor that FEMA is obligated to give outright grants, 
rather than loans, to damaged houses and businesses after quakes of 8.0 or 
more. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Cover-up: Adweek magazine reports that the Museum Square building on Wilshire 
Boulevard has unveiled "the latest way to cover up earthquake damage . . . with 
advertising. With a healthy chunk of one corner of the building noticeably 
missing, managers decided to cover it up (with) a large banner that reads, 'Now 
leasing,' directly over the damage." 
</P>
<P>
 The building's management said the placement was intentional, adding, "The 
damage is cosmetic, which is why we put a banner over it. . . . We were going 
to put a Band-Aid up, but it was taking too long. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Adweek's comment: "Interesting strategy, but would it fly in a client 
meeting?" 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks, but hope we don't see you again on TV for a while: Ken Wilkins of 
Northridge writes that Angelenos "didn't look to the mayor, governor or the 
President for comfort and understanding" after the quake. No, they turned to 
the U.S. Geological Survey's Lucy Jones and Caltech's Kate Hutton, whom he 
salutes in verse: 
</P>
<P>
 With mikes in their faces the questions abound  
</P>
<P>
 But cautious are the answers on the shaking ground.  
</P>
<P>
 Their knowledge is great and their patience is long  
</P>
<P>
 As each shock is noted, just where and how strong.  
</P>
<P>
 So break our dishes and rattle our bones --  
</P>
<P>
 We still have Hutton and we still have Jones. miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
 Newspaper stands selling real-estate advertisers are common. But we saw one in 
Westwood that advertised property a bit north of L.A. It was titled, "Oregon 
Rentals and Homes for Sale."

REWARDS OKD IN POLICE DEATHS; CRIME: GOVERNOR AUTHORIZES $50,000 IN EACH OF TWO 
CASES. HE CALLS FOR INCREASING THE MAXIMUM THE STATE MAY OFFER TO $100,000.

 One day after attending the funeral of slain Los Angeles Police Officer 
Christy Lynne Hamilton, Gov. Pete Wilson signed executive orders Tuesday 
offering two $50,000 rewards for information leading to the arrest and 
conviction of the killers of two other Southern California police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson offered rewards in the deaths of Howard Ellsworth Dallies Jr. of Garden 
Grove and Martin Ganz of Manhattan Beach, both gunned down in the line of duty. 
Nine law enforcement officers were killed in Southern California during the 
past year; only the killers of Dallies and Ganz remain at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanked by Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren and several Los Angeles-area law enforcement 
authorities, Wilson also announced that he is asking the Legislature to 
introduce a bill to amend the state penal code to give him the authority to 
offer rewards of up to $100,000. The code limits such rewards to $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "An attack on a peace officer is an attack on all of us," Wilson said at a 
Downtown Los Angeles news conference held in the shadow of a memorial that 
honors nearly 200 slain officers. "They have given their lives for us. Now we 
must keep faith with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, 22 California peace officers have been killed while on duty. 
Hamilton, a 45-year-old rookie and mother of two, was shot last week by a 
Northridge teen-ager who had killed his father, then waited to ambush arriving 
police officers. Hamilton had graduated from the Police Academy just four days 
before she died. 
</P>
<P>
 Ganz, a five-year veteran of the Manhattan Beach Police Department, was shot 
Dec. 27 while making a late night traffic stop outside the Manhattan Village 
shopping mall. He was 29. Dallies, who had served on the Garden Grove Police 
Department for nine years, was gunned down by a motorcyclist on a residential 
street on March 9, 1993. He was 36. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is running for reelection. During his term in office, he has offered 
four previous rewards totaling $120,000. The money for the rewards comes from 
the state's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe larger awards can attract more tips to crack a tough case," Wilson 
said, adding that by offering larger sums, "we . . . send the message that we 
won't rest until cop killers are arrested, prosecuted and given the penalty 
they deserve -- the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Dr. Debra Glaser, the LAPD's acting chief police psychologist, 
rewards can be very helpful, even in instances when tipsters worry that coming 
forward will place them in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some people who would probably call to help if they could, 
regardless of whether there is a reward. Then there are some people who don't 
want to get involved, no matter how big a reward is offered. But for the people 
in the middle, the desire not to get involved can sometimes be overridden by 
money," Glaser said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess some people need to be motivated or need to be pushed," she added. 
"But that's better than people not calling at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Cmdr. David J. Gascon, a spokesman for the LAPD, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it may take a significant amount of money to break information 
free," he said, adding that the rewards announced Tuesday were valuable both 
for the tips they may yield and for the point they underscore. "Elected 
officials and the community at large are speaking with one voice, saying, 'We 
can't allow police officers to be victims.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Brownell, co-founder of an anonymous tip hot line called WeTip, said that 
62% of the people who call decline the $1,000 reward that is offered for 
turning in criminals. But 38% accept it, and Brownell believes that the bigger 
the reward, the more tipsters call in. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who put out fires in oil fields get paid a fantastic amount of 
money because of the extreme danger they're in," he said. "The same condition 
applies here."

GUNMAN DIED OF HEAD INJURIES, CORONER RULES; AUTOPSY: RESULTS ALSO REVEAL THAT 
DAVID FUKUTO HAD NOT INGESTED DRUGS OR ALCOHOL BEFORE HE BURST INTO A 
CONFERENCE ROOM AND KILLED TWO POLICE OFFICERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN E. MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County coroner's office has determined that David Fukuto, the 
masked gunman who killed two Palos Verdes Estates police officers last month, 
died from head injuries and asphyxia while being wrestled to the ground by 
police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The autopsy results showed that Fukuto, 32, had not taken drugs or alcohol 
prior to the incident, spokesman Scott Carrier said, eliminating a possible 
explanation for the bizarre and still-unexplained attack during a motivational 
seminar for Palos Verdes Estates police and city employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's office, which has classified Fukuto's death a homicide because 
it occurred at the hands of others, did not release an autopsy report but 
issued a news release summarizing its results. Carrier said the autopsy 
findings were completed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing in writing, but we knew the world was wanting to know the 
results, and that is why we put out the information," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrier said the official cause of death was traumatic head injuries and 
asphyxia due to "neck and body compression and blunt force trauma" when 
officers subdued Fukuto moments after the gunman burst into the 12th-floor 
conference room where 13 top police and city officials were meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Fukuto, with a pistol in each hand, was confronted by two officers -- Capt. 
Michael Tracy, 50, and Sgt. Vernon Thomas Vanderpool, 57 -- whom he shot to 
death before being wrestled to the ground by other officers. The gunman, the 
son of state District Court of Appeal Justice Morio Fukuto, died a short time 
later at Little Company of Mary Hospital in Torrance, Carrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrier provided no details of the fatal injuries to Fukuto's head, saying 
only that the self-employed life insurance salesman apparently had been kicked 
or beaten. Fukuto did not die from a police chokehold because none of his neck 
or throat bones were broken or fractured, Carrier said, although it was 
possible that Fukuto's bulletproof vest pushed up against his neck and choked 
his air passage. 
</P>
<P>
 "This man was apparently swarmed (by the officers), and they took him down on 
the floor and were on top of him trying to restrain him," Carrier said. "It was 
because of them doing this that we came to the finding of compression to the 
neck and body." 
</P>
<P>
 District attorney spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said the coroner's finding that 
Fukuto's death was a homicide means that he "was killed by other persons and 
did not die from natural causes." But Gibbons said the autopsy results 
represent only one facet of the district attorney's investigation.  
</P>
<P>
 "Once we have all of the elements in, we will sit down and evaluate them and 
make our decision on how to proceed," Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance Police Sgt. Dave Smith said investigators have begun forwarding 
information to the district attorney's office, which is expected to make a 
finding within a week. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since the attack, Fukuto's parents issued a public 
statement about the incident, Smith said. "Judge Fukuto spoke with our 
investigators today and told them that it is the family's intent not to pursue 
any investigation or make any accusation of wrongdoing against the Palos Verdes 
Estates Police Department involving the death of their son," Smith said.

MAN ACCUSED OF MOLESTING GIRL ON PLANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Hermosa Beach man has been arrested on charges of molesting a 12-year-old 
girl on a crowded Southwest Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, 
police in Las Vegas said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl said that other passengers and a flight attendant did nothing to stop 
the man despite her loud and repeated cries to "Stop touching me! I don't like 
it!" 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's mother, Tammy Ruffner, said the suspect approached her after the 
plane landed and "told me I was a neglectful mother for allowing my daughter to 
fly alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, when the man tried to leave, Ruffner's boyfriend and a 
Southwest employee grabbed the suspect and held him until police arrived, 
Ruffner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Edward Gustafson, 48, was arrested at McCarran International Airport 
and held at the Clark County Detention Center on $30,000 bond, Las Vegas police 
said. Gustafson later posted bail and was released. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest issued a statement from its corporate offices in Dallas expressing 
regret about the incident and saying that an internal investigation has begun, 
according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's father, Steve Craig, who is divorced from Ruffner, said his 
daughter visited him in Lakewood last weekend. He said he put her on 
Southwest's Flight 407 for the 45-minute trip to her home in Las Vegas Sunday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline does not assign specific seats to its passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl said that before she boarded the plane, she saw two friends of her 
father who were going to be on the same flight. She said she boarded early, 
selecting an aisle seat for herself and saving the two seats beside her for her 
father's friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "But two (other) men got on the plane and told me they wanted those seats," 
she said. "They said I couldn't save seats. They pushed me over next to the 
window and sat down. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I turned away and tried to go to sleep, but the man next to me reached over 
me," she said. "He touched my breasts . . . and the inside of my leg. . . . I 
asked him to stop, and told him I didn't like it, but he kept doing it. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The other passengers did absolutely nothing," she said. "The lady behind me 
said, 'Be quiet!' The others did nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 The girl said that when a male flight attendant stopped by to serve drinks, 
she turned to Gustafson and said in a loud voice, "Stop touching me! . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "But the steward did nothing," she said. "I looked right at him, and he did 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 The girl said she didn't get up and try to find her father's friends "because 
I didn't want to push past those two guys next to me. Besides, the plane was 
full, and I didn't think I could find another seat." 
</P>
<P>
 When the plane landed in Las Vegas, the girl ran to her mother and burst into 
tears. The mother's boyfriend and a Southwest supervisor chased down Gustafson 
and held him until the arrest was made, the girl said. Police said the man who 
had been sitting with Gustafson was not held.

SCHOOL SHOOTING THREAT REPORTED; VIOLENCE: SOUTH GATE TEACHER ALLEGEDLY SAID HE 
WOULD MOW DOWN THOSE IN THE FACULTY LOUNGE. HIS ATTORNEY CALLS THE CHARGES 
OVERBLOWN.

 The South Gate kindergarten teacher who brought a loaded handgun on campus 
last week threatened to saw off a shotgun and mow down teachers in the faculty 
lounge, then kill himself, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Jett Jr., who appeared in South Gate Municipal Court on Tuesday, made 
the threats against the staff at Montara Street Elementary School last Thursday 
evening in a telephone call to a substitute teacher, authorities said. Jett 
indicated that he was incensed that someone at the school had told police about 
the handgun in his car, which was parked in the school lot, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very specific about sawing off his shotgun to mow down and cut down 
the teachers in the lounge," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Tia Fisher. "He made very 
concrete threats. He named names. He had the firepower to carry it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Jett, who did not enter a plea in court Tuesday, was first arrested on the 
handgun charge Thursday and released on $20,000 bond. He was rearrested Friday 
at a school district office for the threats, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 Jett's bail was initially set at $150,000, then raised to $1 million Friday 
after police found other weapons in the Torrance home he shares with his 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, South Gate Municipal Court Commissioner Ana Maria Luna reduced 
Jett's bail to $750,000 and set a preliminary hearing for March 14. Luna said 
the teacher still posed a danger to the school staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert McDaniel, Jett's attorney, said Tuesday that the charges are overblown 
and that the 36-year-old teacher is innocent. Jett was charged with two 
felonies -- bringing a handgun on school grounds and making terrorist threats 
-- and could face a maximum of seven years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me if we look at the individual involved, we'll see someone who 
is really incapable of hurting anybody," McDaniel said. "He is a fine, 
upstanding citizen who would never hurt a fly." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher said in court that Jett indicated he would "hunt down and kill" 
whomever reported the gun to police, and that if it was the teacher's assistant 
in his class he would kill her. Further, Fisher said, Jett threatened to bring 
his shotgun and "end the careers" of all the teachers at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher said the school principal indicated that Jett had previously been 
reproached for teaching kindergarten in camouflage clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jett's parents said their son is a war enthusiast who enjoys collecting guns. 
They said they were shocked by the allegations. "He's a gun collector, he's a 
Civil War re-enactor and he's a member of the NRA in good standing," Mary Jett 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 At Montara Elementary School, Principal Juliana Dawson refused to discuss the 
case.

COUNTY SUPERVISORS REJECT HIRING FREEZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite projections of severe budget shortfalls, the Los Angeles County Board 
of Supervisors on Tuesday turned back an effort to implement a hiring freeze 
and voted instead to exempt several county departments from any future hiring 
freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the supervisors agreed to take up the matter again in two weeks, the 
vote was a blow to the county's new chief administrative officer, Sally Reed, 
who proposed the hard-and-fast freeze on all hiring and promotions to lessen 
the need for significant layoffs later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course I'm disappointed, but these are hard decisions," Reed said after 
the four-hour debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed told the board that by postponing the freeze "we are sending absolutely 
the wrong message" to scores of department heads. "What you are doing today is 
weakening our control of the budget," Reed said. "Now every department head 
will know they can come to the board on any given Tuesday for an exemption," 
from any hiring freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 The board agreed to exempt two new Sheriff's Department academy classes -- 
about 200 cadets -- from the hiring freeze, as well as any medical personnel 
necessary to maintaining accreditation of the county's hospital facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed said the board must begin preparing for a projected $1-billion budget 
shortfall when the new fiscal year begins in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has had a hiring freeze of a sort in effect for the last year. 
Described by Reed as a "Swiss cheese freeze," it allows hundreds of new workers 
to be hired each month. In the past year, nearly 5,000 employees have been 
hired by the county, according to figures compiled by Reed's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors were divided on the freeze proposal. Supervisor Gloria Molina 
advocated a tough freeze, but wanted a clear, definitive implementation plan 
first. Supervisor Ed Edelman said a hard-and-fast freeze unfairly ties the 
hands of department heads and he recommended they be given a target budget cut 
and be allowed to design their own plan for meeting it.

BILL BOYARSKY: HERNANDEZ'S ILL-ADVISED PUSH FOR SEPARATISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Hernandez is a bundle of anger and 
frustration these days. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotions fill his bulky body. When he speaks he has trouble expressing 
himself, as if he can't find the words to convey his feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Hernandez's rage is prompted by the trouble he has encountered in 
trying to help a part of his district, a poor, overcrowded, gang- and 
drug-ridden old neighborhood within walking distance of Downtown's glittering 
high-rises. 
</P>
<P>
 So desperate is Hernandez to relieve the overcrowding in crumbling apartments 
that he has embraced a radical solution. He is proposing to limit residency in 
a new city-subsidized, 32-unit low-income apartment development in Pico Union 
to those living in three ZIP codes surrounding the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the residents of those ZIP codes are almost entirely Latino, the 
practical effect of the proposal would be to restrict occupancy to Latinos. 
This would be a dramatic departure from current city policy of opening such 
low-income housing to all of L.A.'s poor. And, in the view of some city 
officials and council members, it would be tantamount to government-approved 
discrimination against poor people who live in other areas, including an 
impoverished black population in nearby South L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who is black, whether he thought 
the proposal amounted to government-sponsored segregation. He said that is not 
Hernandez's intention but the plan could set such a precedent. A white liberal, 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, said, "the minute we do things by geography is the 
day Balkanized Los Angeles arrives." 
</P>
<P>
 But to the angry Hernandez, L.A. is already a city of Balkanized neighborhoods 
segregated by race and class. And the affluent ones have adopted neighborhood 
zoning plans that effectively ban construction of low-income housing such as 
Pico Union's Crescent Court housing development. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday morning I stopped by Crescent Court, which is just about ready for 
occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
 I could see why the neighbors were so anxious to have it for themselves. The 
Crescent Court development consists of two-story duplexes, with stucco and wood 
exteriors painted in a sharp yellow and gray. Newly planted grass was growing 
in the yards.  
</P>
<P>
 Although a fairly new condo development is across the street from Crescent 
Court, most of the apartment buildings in the neighborhood date back to the 
early part of the century. Three or four families are packed into some of the 
old apartment units, making this L.A.'s most densely populated area. The street 
looked peaceful. But the graffiti on the walls told of gang occupation, and I 
knew from past visits that drug dealers operated on street corners, especially 
near the crowded schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The overcrowding and the dangerous streets constitute powerful arguments for 
Hernandez's plan to give the residents preference in Crescent Court. So is the 
history of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '40s and '50s, the area around the new apartment development was a 
solid, working-class Mexican American neighborhood. But much of it was 
bulldozed to make room for the huge interchange of the Santa Monica and Harbor 
freeways; a big Pep Boys headquarters building, and, finally, the mammoth 
expansion of the Convention Center. Each time, residents had to scramble for 
new housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pico Union people have been moved from one place to another place to 
another place," Hernandez told the City Council's Housing and Community 
Development Committee on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is another chapter of history, just as important, that argues 
against the city sponsoring a restricted housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the '50s, when the civil rights movement was emerging, a multiracial 
liberal coalition proposed a law banning racial discrimination in California 
residential real estate sales. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1963, the coalition was strong enough to take on the powerful real estate 
lobby in the Legislature. When the coalition's fair housing bill got tied up in 
the Senate, after passing the Assembly, black and white families staged a 
sit-in in the Capitol rotunda. It lasted for days and the crowd's singing of 
"We Shall Overcome" was an uplifting counterpoint to the Legislature's usual 
cynicism. Finally, the measure passed. That wasn't the end of the story. The 
voters repealed it, the courts reinstated it, and a generation of liberals have 
never forgotten their coalition days. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'd watched a lot of this history as a reporter. I remember the times the 
Mexican American community vainly fought for their neighborhood. I can 
understand Hernandez's anger. 
</P>
<P>
 But separatism is a losing course. We can see that in Bosnia. The old 
California liberals were right when they fought segregated housing more than 30 
years ago.

DINAH SHORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "TV Pioneer, Entertainer Dinah Shore Dies at 76," Feb. 25: 
</P>
<P>
 The articles about Dinah Shore understandably emphasize her remarkable 
professional career. She was the best! 
</P>
<P>
 It should also be noted, however, that she devoted her skill and prestige to 
innumerable civic, sporting, charitable and political activities. I was the 
beneficiary of Dinah's active support in my 1958 campaign for attorney general 
and as a result we became good friends. Indeed, I had the pleasure of 
performing her daughter's wedding ceremony. Dinah's loss will be deeply felt; 
she will be fondly remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 JUSTICE STANLEY MOSK 
</P>
<P>
 Supreme Court of California, San Francisco 
</P>
<P>
 * Stories about the late Dinah Shore have focused on her television career, 
and most readers will remember her for that. But it is only fair to recall her 
extraordinary success as a recording artist. 
</P>
<P>
 During the era of the Big Bands, and the glory years of the pop singers that 
flourished after World War II, Dinah Shore was the third biggest selling 
recording artist. Dinah Shore was, among the girl singers, the only one who had 
major success as a solo recording artist during the early '40s, when the bands 
were dominating the scene. Although she made some studio recordings with bands, 
she was never hired as a band singer. She got a job as a radio singer which led 
to a record contract, and she began appearing on the charts of best-selling 
records in 1941. She had several hits every year from 1941 through 1952, 
including No. 1 in 1944 ("I'll Walk Alone") and 1948 ("Buttons and Bows"). Her 
total of 37 hits makes her fourth on the all-time list of pre-rock singers.

U.N. EMBARGO AGAINST IRAQ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to Ramsey Clark's Column Left, "Iraq Embargo Is Killing Kids; 
End It Now," Feb. 22: 
</P>
<P>
 Sanctions against the government of Iraq were imposed because of that 
government's well-documented record of brutality against minority indigenous 
people living within its borders. It represents a brutal, but necessary 
measure, as it curbs the ability of the Iraqi government to do business, and 
represents the price that the Iraqi people are required to pay for supporting 
the regime. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clark is so concerned over the humaneness of this situation, and the 
suffering that it entails, perhaps he would consider the suffering of the 
"marsh Arabs" of Iraq, the Shiite Muslims of the southeastern region of the 
country, whose suffering at the hands of the Iraqi government was so vividly 
detailed in a brilliant report on the "MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour" of Feb. 21. 
The report details how the government is draining the marshes, depriving these 
people of water for working, food and life itself, as part of a systematic 
attempt at genocide, much as practiced against the Iraqi Kurds. The report is 
enlightening for all who can see it, and is eloquent rebuttal to Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 BARRY SCHNEIDER 
</P>
<P>
 Chino 
</P>
<P>
 * I find it disturbing that an allegedly well-meaning humanist such as Clark 
would so skillfully misrepresent the situation. There has never been an embargo 
preventing the importation of food and medicine. The problem is that aside from 
international contributions of such items, the Iraqi government refuses to 
purchase these items. The claim is lack of foreign exchange. If Saddam Hussein 
would be willing to release a few bucks from his hoard in the Swiss banks, the 
women and children of Iraq would not be deprived of anything. 
</P>
<P>
 I find it especially hypocritical for Clark to argue against embargoes since 
he was most vehement in proposing the embargo in place of military action prior 
to the Persian Gulf War. Is he opposed to the Haitian embargo too? Clark should 
use his skills of persuasion on Hussein if he has the welfare of the Iraqi 
people at heart. 
</P>
<P>
 IRWIN GROSSMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * Clark's column impressed me. He told of the devastating effect the embargo 
has had on the citizens of Iraq. I agree with him that innocent people suffer 
more than the heads of government. 
</P>
<P>
 However, what about the embargo we have placed against Cuba these last 30 
years? They are suffering also. In the case of Cuba we (the United States) have 
done so unilaterally. Even the United Nations has berated us for doing so. Even 
our "friends" have voted against us! Is it not time to end that embargo first? 
Cuba has suffered long enough.

SECTION 8 HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Guido De Rienzo raises valid points about the difficulties low-income 
renters face in the San Fernando Valley and throughout the Los Angeles area 
(Opinion, Feb. 6). However, his assumptions about the Section 8 emergency 
housing program are off base. 
</P>
<P>
 By committing his emergency reserve to this program, HUD Secretary Henry 
Cisneros recognized that the Section 8 program is the most effective means of 
quickly providing decent and safe housing for very low-income families 
displaced by the disaster. Section 8 certificate holders have the assurance of 
18 months of rental assistance so their rent will be affordable. The Housing 
Authority inspects units prior to guaranteeing the owner Section 8, so the 
tenants are assured of a decent and safe home, which the owner must maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Housing Authority sets the total rent (the tenant's payment plus 
the subsidy) according to prevailing rents for similar unsubsidized units, rent 
gouging is prevented. The Housing Authority also helps tenants find units in 
all areas of the city by providing certificate holders with listings of 
property owners who want to participate in the Section 8 program. Finally, 
Cisneros has committed HUD staff and resources to quickly address any 
discrimination by landlords and to assist tenants with mobility difficulties to 
locate and move into units. 
</P>
<P>
 De Rienzo suggests that "housing grants" replace the Section 8 program. Such 
an approach would be devastating to very low-income families who need the help 
of Housing Authority employees to locate units, negotiate rents with landlords 
and ensure good housing quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Housing Authority's employees, most of whom are represented by De Rienzo's 
American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), are 
making it possible through their heroic efforts and professionalism for very 
low-income families to rebound from the earthquake.

FUNDING PRIORITIES AND EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I read with interest your interview with Education Secretary Richard Riley 
regarding challenges faced by our nation's public education system (Opinion, 
Feb. 13). While Riley's assessment of the problems in today's public eduction 
system is generally accurate, he neglects to mention another factor which 
heavily contributes to the problems of California's public eduction system: our 
state's spending priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed California budget for 1994-95, the state would allot $4,217 
per K-12 student, which is the same amount the state is spending this current 
school year. If the budget is approved, it will be the fourth year in a row our 
schools have not received a cost-of-living adjustment. And, in real terms, that 
relates to an actual 3% reduction in purchasing power, or $116 less per 
student. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last 10 years, K-12 funding has increased only 4.7% while overall state 
spending increased 6.7%. Spending for welfare rose 8.5% and funding for prisons 
has jumped to 14.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, we spend an extraordinary amount of state and federal money on 
unemployment, health, welfare and prison programs now because we haven't 
invested enough to educate children early and well. We spend $19,000 in the 
first year on a drop-out student who receives AFDC, food stamps and Medi-Cal, 
having given birth to a child. We jump to spend $32,000 to keep a young person 
in the California Youth Authority for one year, but we can't come up with an 
extra pittance to keep the same youngster productively in school. Unless we 
change our funding priorities, the quality of our society and our total tax 
burden will continue to worsen. 
</P>
<P>
 California needs to re-evaluate its priorities: Pay for and implement 
effective schooling strategies now and avoid having to commit to costlier 
solutions later.

AT LAST, THE WEST SHOWS SOME SPINE; POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS QUICKLY FOLLOW JET 
ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Monday U.S. F-16 fighters flying for NATO shot down four Serbian warplanes 
returning from a bombing raid on a Bosnian munitions plant. On Tuesday, after 
talks in Moscow, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said that for the first 
time in two years his forces will allow aid flights into the besieged Muslim 
town of Tuzla. 
</P>
<P>
 Did the air attack cause the change? NATO and Russia were sharing (or 
competing for) credit. Karadzic linked the opening of the Tuzla airport not to 
the NATO attack but to a Russian commitment to send peacekeepers to Tuzla to 
keep out military deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S.-SPONSORED PACT: The airport opening thus parallels the silencing of the 
Serb artillery around Sarajevo as an action that places Russia and NATO in de 
facto cooperation. Washington and London welcomed the Tuzla announcement, and 
Russia, significantly, did not condemn the NATO attack. Bosnian Muslim 
skepticism about the benevolent intent of Russian troops on Bosnian soil is 
understandable, but more important, perhaps, is the fact that both Karadzic and 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev described their talks as difficult. For 
the Serbs, the new developments in Sarajevo and Tuzla may be a retreat rather 
than a defeat, but a retreat is still a far cry from victory, and the Tuzla 
announcement occasioned no Serb elation. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Bosnian Serbs, under Russian pressure, were opening the Tuzla 
airport, the Bosnian Muslims and Croats, under U.S. pressure, were signing an 
agreement in Washington for a binational, Muslim-Croat Bosnian state in 
federation with Croatia. The three-way ethnic partition of Bosnia proposed by 
European Union negotiators has now clearly been set aside. Monday's NATO 
attack, though directed at Serbian planes, seems to have strengthened the shaky 
Croatian-Muslim truce in areas where there had been fighting even as 
negotiations grew more serious in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 NO VIETNAM: This should not come as a huge surprise. The Balkans are not to be 
compared with Vietnam in population, strategic location or political position. 
Vietnam, with three times the Balkans' population, is halfway around the world 
from the United States and during the Vietnam War enjoyed the advantage of 
secure overland supply lines and the backing of a superpower only too happy to 
see its rival bogged down in an unwinnable war. The Balkans lie next door to 
Italy, a NATO member, and lack secure supply lines and the ability to play one 
superpower against the other. All that had been wanting to make these factors 
yield peace was a demonstration that the major powers were prepared to use 
their overwhelming military advantage. As this demonstration has come, the 
impact has been dramatic and immediate. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson to be drawn is painfully obvious. One can only regret that it was 
not drawn two years ago, on behalf of Croatia as well as Bosnia, sparing Europe 
thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of refugees, not to speak of a 
debilitating doubt about the state of its collective security.

RIGHTS WATCH; BUSINESS OF SCOUTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It ought to be enough that William and Michael Randall, twin brothers in 
Orange County, say they enjoy being Boy Scouts and have no intention of 
imposing their views on anyone else. But they have had to change troops because 
of ill feeling over their refusal to profess belief in God.And the county 
chapter of the Boy Scouts of America wants to exclude them from membership 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4th District Court of Appeal Monday ruled wisely in the latest chapter of 
a long-running clash between the Scouts and the boys, represented by their 
father. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit Orange County Council of the Scouts argued that it is a private 
organization with constitutionally protected rights of association and that as 
such it can decide whom to admit and exclude. But the court held instead that 
the council is a business, with stores, $9 million in assets and an annual 
budget of $4 million. As such, the Scouts are subject to the state Unruh Civil 
Rights Act, which prohibits businesses from discriminating on the basis of 
religion or race. 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, a lower court judge who reviewed the case earlier said the 
activities the boys were engaged in were not about religion at all.  
</P>
<P>
 If the young people are uncomfortable swearing allegiance, why not leave them 
alone, rather than insisting on extracting an oath? Unfortunately, the dispute 
is likely to drag on, because the Scouts say they plan to appeal to the state 
Supreme Court.  
</P>
<P>
 It would be far better to drop the matter, to avoid putting the boys through 
further litigation and scrutiny.

SKY-HIGH COST FOR A PANACEA; '3 STRIKES' ANTI-CRIME INITIATIVE WOULD REQUIRE 
MANY BILLIONS, STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Americans struggle to find ways to achieve national health care reform, 
cost is an absorbing concern. Yet in the present anti-crime stampede it seems 
that California lawmakers are all but oblivious to what the price tag will be 
if the "three strikes and you're out" notion becomes law. The Legislature is 
rushing to approve proposals that eventually would thud down onto the state 
budget with near-paralyzing impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Corrections on Monday released its long-awaited 
estimate of costs under a three-strikes initiative that backers will put on the 
November ballot if a legislative version unexpectedly fails. It turns out that 
California would have to build 20 prisons -- above the 12 already planned -- 
and spend $2 billion a year to operate them by the end of the 1990s. The 
operating cost would continue to increase for about 30 years, when the 
additional cost of running the new facilities would be $5.7 billion annually. 
By that time, the California prison population, now 120,000 inmates and already 
the largest in any state, would have grown by 275,000. This estimate does not 
include the court system's cost for more and possibly longer criminal trials or 
medical expenditures for the prisons' mushrooming elderly population. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative and its counterpart bill would impose mandatory life terms for 
third-time felons, including those convicted of serious but not violent crimes 
such as burglary. Gov. Pete Wilson says he supports the initiative and its 
counterpart legislation. Five mandatory-sentencing proposals have passed the 
Assembly without detailed cost analysis and may go to the Senate floor by 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing the Corrections Department numbers, Assemblyman John Vasconcellos 
(D-Santa Clara), chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, 
courageously declared: "We can't afford that. There is no state of California 
left, except for the police and prison state." 
</P>
<P>
 A wiser and less expensive plan would be to impose life terms on violent 
repeat felons alone, or perhaps to lock them up only until middle age, when 
research indicates violence diminishes.

 TREMORS IN AN OLD FRIENDSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fears for what was once dubbed the "special relationship" between Washington 
and London prompted this week's visit of British Prime Minister John Major to 
President Clinton. What's at stake is nothing less than an extraordinary 
bilateral alliance that has fought two world wars together and has in so many 
other ways contributed to world order. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hands of Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt -- or even, for 
that matter, in those of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan -- that 
relationship was special. But the current thought among the respective foreign 
policy establishments is that it would be better to bury the adjective special 
and replace it with something less elevating. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be a mistake. Each of the two nations needs an ally on which it can 
count in the crunch, and neither Washington nor London is likely to find anyone 
better for quite a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship ran into serious trouble even before Clinton's election; 
during the U.S. presidential campaign operatives from the British Conservative 
Party helped the Bush reelection effort, an outrageous intervention in the 
internal political affairs of the United States that angered Clinton's people. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither is London entirely happy with Clinton, of course. His decision to 
grant a visitor's visa to the head of the Irish Republican Army's political 
wing evoked bitter criticism from the British government -- further evidence 
that the personal chemistry between Clinton and Major is not what it might be. 
However, chemistry is irrelevant: Thatcher and George Bush did not get on well, 
as her memoirs reveal, but bilateral relations were excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Clinton and Major are masters of non-ideological common sense, which is 
the linchpin of the special British-American alliance. It is their job to get 
along: Too much depends on it.

PLATFORM; RESPECT FOR THE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMAND ARABIAN, an associate justice of the state Supreme Court, told 
delegates to a recent Independent Cities Assn. seminar that public safety is a 
challenge that cities must meet: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Good citizens are now behind bars . . . on the windows of their homes. Parents 
forbid their children to play in the local park.Recently I read a newspaper 
account of some 11-year-old children writing wills to their parents, telling 
them what clothes they wished to be buried in. 
</P>
<P>
 Collectively, we are faced with a challenge. How we choose to respond will 
either restore the safety and security of our streets and homes, or ensure the 
relinquishment of our freedom to the scourge of crime and the will of the 
outlaw. 
</P>
<P>
 We must make it resoundingly clear to those who choose to disregard the rule 
of law necessary for a prosperous and secure society that any anti-social 
behavior will be met swiftly and severely. Respect for law enforcement is at 
tragically low levels. Sadly, many cities have tolerated the gradual 
development of a hate-a-cop culture. Support for these last barriers between 
the citizenry and anarchy must begin with elected officials and civic leaders 
in every town.

PERSPECTIVE ON MEXICO; UNINTENDED REVOLUTION IN CHIAPAS; PASSED OVER BY 
SALINAS, CAMACHO IS TEMPTED TO RIDE HIS NEW IMAGE INTO AN INDEPENDENT RUN FOR 
THE PRESIDENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE DRESSER, Denise Dresser is a professor of political science at the 
Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico (ITAM) and currently a visiting 
scholar at the Center for International Studies at USC. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As peace talks evolve in a cathedral in Chiapas, another political drama with 
far-reaching consequences is unfolding in Mexico. It is becoming increasingly 
clear that the government's representative, Manuel Camacho Solis, while 
negotiating with the Zapatista National Liberation Front is also testing a 
behind-the-scenes campaign to become Mexico's next president. If he proceeds, 
Mexico may soon witness the unraveling of the ruling party and the end of the 
political system that has governed the country for more than 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
 As President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's "commissioner for peace," Camacho has 
spent the past few weeks negotiating and ingratiating himself with the masked 
leaders of Mexico's peasant rebellion -- and getting voluminous coverage in the 
media. In the meantime, his top aides have organized dinners for their boss 
with Mexico's most powerful businessmen, rented a large office building 
(presumably for campaign headquarters) in Mexico City, leaked Camacho's 
presidential aspirations to the foreign press and conducted nationwide polls to 
measure his popularity. The "Magnificent Seven" -- as the Camacho team is 
jokingly referred to -- are playing hard ball and high politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people, including Camacho himself, thought that he would be Salinas' 
choice to head the PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party) ticket in August. 
Instead, Salinas chose a protege, Luis Donaldo Colosio, whose campaign 
officially began on Jan. 1, the day the rebellion broke out in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdened by Camacho's growing popularity and the anti-government sentiments 
awakened by Chiapas, Colosio is running a clumsy and ineffectual campaign. 
Camacho might try to persuade Salinas that Colosio has become a political 
liability and should be removed. 
</P>
<P>
 While this might appeal to Salinas' well-known pragmatism, the president may 
not be willing to risk unleashing political havoc in the name of democracy. In 
that case, Camacho could run as the candidate of one of Mexico's smaller 
parties that may be willing to support his candidacy in return for future power 
and prestige. Camacho would portray himself as Mexico's modernizing yet 
moderate alternative; as more of a democrat than the PRI-tainted candidate and 
as less of a radical than the leftist Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it would be a mistake to view Camacho as the beacon of democracy in 
Mexico. He has played by the PRI's rules for more than 15 years. As mayor of 
Mexico City, he was recognized as a political broker, not as an apostle of 
substantive political reform. His considerable mediating skills helped Salinas 
save face after the turbulent and widely questioned presidential elections in 
1988. And several of his top aides are young dinosaurs, known for their less 
than modern political practices.  
</P>
<P>
 Camacho is a Mexican version of Japan's Morihiro Hosokawa -- a pragmatic 
tactician using a crisis and the attendant outcry for reform to further his 
political standing. Like Hosokawa, he can be viewed as a modernizer but also as 
an opportunist, seeking to transform the political system so that he can lead 
it. Once in power, however, like most politicians, he would have to be pushed 
and prodded to loosen the reins.  
</P>
<P>
 Would a Camacho candidacy spur political change in Mexico? Initially it would 
split an already divided and bewildered PRI. Ever since the Chiapas uprising, 
members of Mexico's ruling party no longer know whether to gamble on Salinas 
the lame duck, Colosio the dazed and confused or Camacho the loose cannon. 
Colosio's removal would certainly lead his supporters to revolt, and a period 
of instability and political cannibalism would ensue. Yet a Camacho candidacy 
would mean the end of the PRI as Mexico has known it, opening windows of 
opportunity for the kind of competitive politics Mexico so desperately needs. 
Whether that is worth the climate of uncertainty that his experimental 
challenge to PRI would create is something only Camacho can calculate.  
</P>
<P>
 Mexican politics were in a state of flux before the Chiapas crisis erupted, 
but Camacho may consider the gravity of that complication reason enough to put 
his presidential ambitions on the back burner for six years. If Colosio 
miraculously recovers in the polls, or if the negotiations in Chiapas get 
bogged down, Camacho may retrench and wait until after the August election to 
build his own political base, a Mexican social democratic party, from which to 
run for the presidency in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, it will be a great irony if Camacho the rejected uses his role 
as commissioner of peace to springboard back into the political wars.

FEMINISM SELLS WOMEN SHORT; RATHER THAN BEING PREPARED TO DEAL EFFECTIVELY WITH 
LIFE, WOMEN ARE BEING TAUGHT TO WHINE AND SUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH SHERVEN, Judith Sherven is a clinical psychologist in West Los 
Angeles who is writing a book on women and victimization. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Feminist Marianne Walters desires a "world where one might never need to fear 
sexual harassment." Rather than a worldly, professional woman, she sounds like 
a small, innocent child dreaming of perfection to keep away the night demons. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual harassment cannot ever be eradicated because much of it exists through 
the interpretive eye of the beholder. Confusion and miscommunication between 
men and women is a reality to be learned about and negotiated rather than 
wished away. 
</P>
<P>
 Current radical feminist rhetoric like Walters' undermines the goal of equal 
rights and responsibilities for women in favor of the romantic and narcissistic 
ideal of a perfect, stress-free world -- for women. In this disempowering 
fantasy, women do not have to grow up or become responsible for themselves. 
That leaves men the only responsible people on the planet. Instead of insisting 
that women achieve their potential, the makers of these child's-world fantasies 
encourage women to blame men and society for all of their difficulties. They 
teach women to look to Big Daddy Government and Great Mama National 
Organization for Women to solve all their problems. Any woman who aspires to 
personal power or success should be outraged at this fragile-pansy propaganda. 
Yet there are few voices willing to risk the righteous judgment of the feminist 
elite. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of it: Feminist leaders, purportedly women of thought and consequence, 
treating themselves and their fellow women like overgrown baby dolls who can 
neither think for themselves nor prevail against all-powerful men. For example, 
current politically correct dogma insists that if two adults get drunk and have 
consensual sex, only the man should be held accountable for what transpires.  
</P>
<P>
 As a woman and as a clinical psychologist for 15 years, I am deeply afraid for 
my sex. Women's leaders today are teaching victimhood as the primary identity 
for all women and powerlessness as strength. I have heard feminist attorney and 
radio talk-show personality Gloria Allred stretch the bounds of credibility by 
repeatedly asserting that "women do not lie." She has no difficulty, however, 
pronouncing men as liars, potential rapists and woman-haters. 
</P>
<P>
 More hysteria is evident when a college professor feels "sexually abused" by 
having a Goya nude hanging in her classroom, and another woman sues for sexual 
harassment because a male colleague brings her roses. Women are undone by 
admiring looks and feel enraged and abused by complimentary whistles on the 
street. One would think women never told dirty jokes. Are women really nothing 
more than retrograde Victorians?  
</P>
<P>
 The denial of women's flaws and faults is pathological. It keeps women 
ignorant of their complicity in their own victimization. It provides no 
preparation for living in the real world in which bad things happen. 
Discomfort, obstacles and misfortune cannot be avoided, no matter how innocent 
women pretend to be. The fact is that life is an unfolding mystery and it 
happens to all of us. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy is that today's women, rather than being prepared to cope more 
effectively and powerfully with life's adversities, are being told to whine and 
sue because they have experienced some of life's troubles. I am not talking 
about rape or any other crime that was on the books prior to 
political-correctness thought control. I am talking about the expectation that 
a woman should be able to "never fear sexual harassment." That is absurd, just 
as moronic as it would be for men to imagine that they could never feel 
manipulated by a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, women's movement leaders fail to understand that in their demand for 
innocence they place the responsibility for women's comfort and safety solely 
in the hands of men. As a result, women are being educated to see themselves as 
ever more dependent and helpless. 
</P>
<P>
 It is frightening to see females portrayed as unable to cope in the real world 
of men and women, penises and vaginas, desire and attraction. We fought so hard 
to be sexually and socially liberated. Is this squeamishness what feminism has 
wrought?

RETURN TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE AND STICK TO TERMS OF AGREEMENT; PEACE TALKS: 
PALESTINIANS MUST NOT USE HEBRON TO VIOLATE THE DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By URI OREN, Uri Oren is Israel's consul general in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We are witnessing a Palestinian attempt to take advantage of the tragedy in 
Hebron in order to breach the basic agreement set forth in the Declaration of 
Principles. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians are trying to move negotiation of the future of the settlements 
tothe intermediate stage, in complete contradiction to the agreements that they 
accepted and signed. It is explicitly stated in the Declaration of Principles 
that the issue of the settlements will be discussed and decided in the final 
stages of the proceedings. At that stage, the various aspects of life in the 
West Bank and Gaza will be weighed and shaped. The final stage is set to be 
completed in five years and the discussions are to begin in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview on CNN last Friday, Israel's ambassador to the United States, 
Itamar Rabinovich, pointed out to his colleague from the Palestine Liberation 
Organization, Saeb Arikat, that raising such a demand would be a serious 
mistake. The signed agreement and its basic principles must be honored in their 
entirety. Yasser Arafat knows this well. He knows that the basic recognition of 
the PLO by Israel that preceded the signing of the Declaration of Principles in 
Washington rested upon Arafat's personal ability as the Palestinian leader to 
prove his credibility. The security of the residents of Israel is dependent 
upon this. It is vital for the success of the peace process. The recent history 
of Arafat's actions and behavior have not supported his credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat must not waste the credit that the government of Israel has given him. 
Moreover, Arafat's strength and ability to gain the faith of the Israeli public 
that he intends to be a good neighbor is his one and only chance to reach the 
bargaining table three years from now, with the goodwill of the government of 
Israel and wide public support for working out the future of the West Bank and 
Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us return to the negotiating table without delay on the basis of the 
statement of principles that was signed on Sept. 13. We all know that we have 
nowhere else to go.

CRIME AND PRISONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Before we start building prisons (at a cost of some $100,000 per cell) to 
launch a new offensive in the "war on crime," let's consider the effectiveness 
of prisons. In fact, let's examine the whole concept of "crime and punishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Why do we put people in prison when they violate the law? It seems to me that 
there are four main reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 1) "That'll teach 'em a lesson." The presumption here is that by putting a 
criminal in prison for a portion of his life, large or small, we give him an 
opportunity to reflect upon his behavior so that when he comes out, he'll be a 
decent, law-abiding citizen. Result: At any given time, about two-thirds of 
those in prison have been there before. This doesn't work! 
</P>
<P>
 2) "We've got to protect the public!" This works, but only for the time the 
criminal is in prison. To really accomplish this goal, we need to give every 
felon a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 3) "The mental well-being of the victims." To put it another way, it's 
vengeance, revenge.  
</P>
<P>
 4) "Prisons send a message." Nearly every society in human history has relied 
upon prisons to serve as a deterrent to crime. But the crime rate still keeps 
rising now. So either not enough people are getting the message, or the message 
has no meaning. It's true that we cannot count the crimes that were not 
committed because the criminal was deterred by the thought of prison. But 
plenty are being committed despite the "message." 
</P>
<P>
 Prisons are very expensive, and so are prisoners. Maybe it's time we tried 
something different, whether it is compulsory "boot camp," psychological 
counseling, whatever. What we really want to do is to change the behavior of 
those who commit crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 And prisons are failing to do this.

 ICY ATTITUDE? The Disney people paid big bucks to hook up with ice star Nancy 
Kerrigan. But "cranky" is how she was described when she got to Disney World in 
Florida on Monday. During the Disney parade she even said to Mickey himself, 
"this is so dumb." Cable talk show host Tom Snyder replayed her comments and 
suggested: "Nancy, lighten up." . . . Maybe she'll be in a better mood when she 
gets to Orange County. Plans are still in the works for her first official 
Disneyland appearance, but she's scheduled to skate on the ice at Anaheim Arena 
on July 1.

 BIG TET: Organizers of the recent Tet Festival in Little Saigon had two goals: 
to give their community a meaningful celebration, and to raise enough money to 
do it all again next year. But last month, says spokesman Van T. Tran, "I think 
we made history." . . . The festival made its largest profit, $100,000. Part 
will pay for next year's event. And nearly half will be donated to local 
community groups.

 UCI WANTED LIST: If you'd once made the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list, would you 
put it on your resume? The official brochure for UC Irvine's WomenFest '94 (B9) 
notes that Thursday's keynote speaker, activist Angela Davis, once made the 
famous list for some of her radical activities. . . . Davis, a political author 
and UC Santa Cruz professor, is familiar with the UCI campus. She was a 
humanities lecturer and researcher there last quarter.

 EASY AS PIE: How do you motivate youngsters to raise school funds? Larry 
Lebrecht, principal of the Christ Lutheran elementary school in Brea, came up 
with a gimmick that's bound to be copied: Top fund-raiser would get to throw a 
whipped cream pie in his face. The excited students raised $12,958 in a 
jog-a-thon, enough for some much-needed computer equipment. . . . The amount 
was "totally unexpected," says Roni Pinault, one of the organizers. It was her 
9-year-old son, Robby, who raised the most -- and got to throw the pie.

HOUSTON WINS VOCALIST, TOP SONG GRAMMYS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was deja vu for Whitney Houston at the 36th annual Grammys on Tuesday night 
as she took the awards for best pop female vocalist and song of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Just three weeks ago, she collected eight trophies at the American Music 
Awards for her single, "I Will Always Love You," and the soundtrack to the 
movie "The Bodyguard." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone can dig and understand 'I Will Always Love You'," she said 
backstage. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolly Parton, who wrote the torch song two decades ago, presented the Grammy 
to Miss Houston. The single has been one of the fastest-selling tunes in music 
history, and the movie soundtrack has sold more than 10 million copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Bennett, country star Mary-Chapin Carpenter and the Disney soundtrack for 
"Aladdin" were among the early winners as the recording industry honored its 
top performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sting, Billy Joel, Houston and Neil Young were among the competitors for the 
prestigious record of the year to be awarded during the televised portion of 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston took the first award of the televised proceedings, best pop vocal 
performance-female, for "I Will Always Love You." Just three weeks ago, she 
collected eight trophies at the American Music Awards for her single, "I Will 
Always Love You," and the soundtrack to the movie "The Bodyguard." 
</P>
<P>
 Dolly Parton, who wrote the torch song two decades ago, presented the Grammy 
to Houston. The single has been one of the fastest-selling tunes in music 
history, and the movie soundtrack has sold more than 10 million copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Other early winners were Aerosmith for best rock group, and U2 for alternative 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 U2's Bono was greeted with cheers and gasps when he used a four-letter word in 
delivering "a message to the young people of America." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the telecast, the "Aladdin" soundtrack was responsible for four 
Grammys. Last year, the movie won two Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle won the award for best pop performance by a duo 
or group for singing, "A Whole New World (Aladdin's Theme)." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter, the country singer who grew up in New Jersey, won the best female 
country vocal performance. Lucinda Williams' "Passionate Kisses," which 
Carpenter covered, received the award for best country song. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett's "Steppin' Out" beat Barbra Streisand's "Back to Broadway" for best 
traditional pop vocal performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a thrill," Bennett said. "I don't know what Barbra's going to say about 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside Radio City Music Hall, a group of protesters that included Kim Gordon 
of Sonic Youth and members of the Breeders criticized the elimination of the 
award for best female rock vocal. 
</P>
<P>
 The other awards for "Aladdin" were: best musical album for children, and best 
instrumental composition written for a motion picture or for television. The 
theme song won best song written for a motion picture or television. 
</P>
<P>
 Sting, whose six nominations topped the field for performers, picked up two 
technical Grammys -- best engineered album and best music video (long form). 
</P>
<P>
 Sting was nominated for record and song for his single "If I Ever Lose My 
Faith in You" and for album with "Ten Summoner's Tales." 
</P>
<P>
 Winners were determined by the ballots of 6,500 voting members of the National 
Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Sting, Joel was also nominated for the song, record and album of the year 
awards. Joel's wife, Christie Brinkley, painted the cover to his "River of 
Dreams" album. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harvest Moon," which represented Young's return to acoustic rock, was 
nominated for song and record of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 R.E.M.'s "Automatic For the People" won nominations for best album and best 
alternative record of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Belly, Blind Melon, Toni Braxton, Digable Planets and SWV competed for the 
best new artist Grammy. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Sinatra, Aretha Franklin, jazz artist Bill Evans and pianist Arthur 
Rubinstein were all to receive lifetime achievement awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The academy also planned to honor songwriter Curtis Mayfield, paralyzed four 
years ago when a lighting tower fell on him, with a performance by an all-star 
band.

 WE'RE HOT: This has certainly been a strange winter in the weather department. 
Rainfall is way down, and now we're hitting a sudden heat wave (above). . . . 
Monday's high of 82 is above average, and today's expected high of 83 would be 
a record. 
</P>
<P>
 QUAKE AID: Hollywood turned out at Paramount Studios Saturday night to raise 
about $15,000 for quake-damaged businesses in the Valley. . . . "It's not what 
we had wanted," said one organizer of the Achey Quakey Benefit, which featured 
a night of cabaret, but the event was still considered a success. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW HOPE: There's some exciting news for those waging the painful battle 
against Lou Gehrig's disease, officially known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS). A new drug, tested in France, apparently slows the disease's 
progression. . . . . But Lynn Klein, a vice president of the ALS Assn. in 
Woodland Hills, cautions the drug is no treatment, and probably won't be ready 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 MAD ABOUT HOOP: March is here, which means madness is coming. For those 
unfamiliar with this annual craze, it's almost time for March Madness, the 
ritual of post-season high school and college basketball tournaments. . . This 
year, some ex-San Fernando and Antelope Valley players likely to make the NCAA 
Tournament include: New Mexico State's D. J. Jackson, New Orleans' Tony Madison 
and UCLA's Marquis Burns. 
</P>
<P>
 NO JUNK FOOD: Arcenio Herrera, a marathon runner from Guatemala now living in 
Sherman Oaks, is always in training. He eats mostly fresh fruit shakes, pasta, 
vegetables, fish, rice and beans. Even his wife has gotten into the act, losing 
more than 60 pounds since the two met in September. . . Herrera, who will run 
in Sunday's L. A. Marathon, addressed students Tuesday at Lassen Elementary 
School in North Hills. (B2) Balmy Days

 The Valley is experiencing unusually high temperatures. Monday's high in 
Burbank was above the average for this time of year and today's high is 
expected to surpass the March 2 record. Burbank highs: 03,11,06,14 1994

 RACE GOES ON: Nearly 500 of the 16,000 runners signed up for the Los Angeles 
Marathon are from Ventura County . . . Registration will continue until 
Saturday at 5 p.m. or until there are 19,000 runners, whichever comes first. . 
. The Jan. 17 quake threw training schedules off-track for many Southern 
Californians (C1), including some residents of hard-hit Fillmore, but most are 
game to compete in Sunday's race. Some Fillmore residents will bus to the race 
with Ventura-based Team Inside Track.

<P>
 HOT STUFF: Consumer demand for pepper spray is hot, but if delays in getting 
the new self-defense spray persist, suppliers say it may not be worth the 
trouble (B1). . . Some Ventura County retailers are still awaiting paperwork 
from the state that will allow them to sell the spray . . . "The state's 
falling down on the job," said one Oxnard gun store owner. Mace is available in 
many stores, but some suppliers say they may stop selling it for similar 
reasons: red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 WEIGHTY MATTERS: Get out your yardstick, it's National Weights and Measures 
Week . . . Ventura County's weights and measures division is celebrating its 
79th anniversary. Nationwide enforcement began in 1799.. . . The county's five 
inspectors examine store checkout scanners, gas pumps, truck scales and 
packaged goods for measurement accuracy, issuing nearly 60 citations a year . . 
. "Most people don't realize someone is around protecting them," said division 
head Bill Korth.

 JEWISH VETERANS: Jewish veterans in Ventura County have formed two new groups 
. . . Jewish War Veterans Post 23 meets at Temple Etz Chaim in Thousand Oaks 
while Post 101 meets at Temple Beth Torah in Ventura . . . Upcoming plans: 
helping with Memorial Day observances in May and commemorating the 50th 
anniversary of the Normandy invasion in June . . . The veterans want "to keep 
their own memories," said Rabbi Shimon Paskow of Temple Etz Chaim. Ready to Run

HENRY H. CLIFFORD; COLLECTOR OF WESTERN LORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Henry H. Clifford, collector of Western Americana who owned one of only two 
complete "Zamorano 80" collections of distinguished books on early California 
history, has died. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford died Feb. 21 in Pasadena, his family announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A retired investment counselor who began his collecting with stamps when he 
was a child, Clifford completed the coveted book collection in 1988 after 35 
painstaking years. The only other complete set is owned by the Frederick W. 
Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford stored his collection in a Los Angeles bank vault, making it 
available to interested parties on request. He believed that rare books given 
to a library get "buried with rare exception." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Zamorano 80" list was compiled in 1945 by the Los Angeles-based 
bibliophiles' Zamorano Club. The list and the club were named for Juan Vicente 
Zamorano, who in the early 19th Century became California's first printer. 
</P>
<P>
 The most valuable book in the collection of 18th- and 19th-Century volumes is 
considered to be "The Life and Adventures of Joaquin Murieta, the Celebrated 
California Bandit," written in 1854 by John Rollin Ridge, son of a Cherokee 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford bought the rare volume nearly two decades ago from a private owner in 
Maine, assuring that he could complete his Zamorano list. 
</P>
<P>
 He completed the list in early 1988 with the $42,000 purchase of two volumes 
from the fabled Estelle Doheny book collection -- a 1770 book by explorer 
Miguel Costanso on the first land expedition into California and an 1831 work 
by Mexican government official Carlos Antonio Carrillo about strengthening 
California defenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Books were not the only thing collected by the Pasadena investor. He moved 
from stamps to western express covers (envelopes), Gold Rush era coins, Native 
American costumes and such memorabilia as miners' scales, a Wells Fargo 
strongbox and the stagecoach guard's shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably should have been a museum curator," Clifford told The Times in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 His interest in Western history led him into the historic riding clubs 
Rancheros Visitadores, Los Caballeros and Westerners, along with the more 
traditional Valley Hunt Club, Zamorano Club and the California Club. He was 
also president of the California Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know," he said of stamp collecting in 1960, "where a hobby like 
this will take you." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in St. Louis, Clifford spent most of his life in Pasadena. As a student 
at Yale, he helped found the singing group "Eight Sons of Eli." 
</P>
<P>
 With time out to serve in the Navy during World War II, Clifford worked half a 
century for his family investment firm, now Clifford Associates in Pasadena, 
retiring in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford is survived by his wife of 60 years, Lucetta Andrews Clifford; a 
daughter, Sally Smith of Sacramento; a son, Tony Clifford of Pasadena, four 
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

NEW DRUG SEEMS TO SLOW EFFECTS OF GEHRIG'S DISEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An experimental new drug appears to be the first to slow the fatal progression 
of Lou Gehrig's disease, which until now has defied all attempts at treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The medicine, called riluzole, is not a cure.But "survival almost doubled in 
some patients" in a study financed by the manufacturer, Dr. Jeffrey Rothstein 
of Johns Hopkins University said. "That's just unheard of." 
</P>
<P>
 Rothstein is co-directing another, larger study of the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The study by the manufacturer, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, is being reported in this 
week's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 The illness, formally known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, killed 
Gehrig, a New York Yankees' first baseman, in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
 ALS is a nerve disease that robs people of muscle control, resulting in 
weakness and wasting. Eventually, victims lose all control of their muscles, 
including breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether this drug will turn out to play a major role in the illness remains to 
be seen. Some experts are skeptical.

WITNESS SAYS SHE SAW DEFENDANT SHOOT FLORIDA ABORTION DOCTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A witness testified Tuesday in the trial of a man accused of killing an 
abortion doctor that she saw the defendant fire the fatal shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard three pops," Della Lindsey said."The first pop got my attention and 
then I saw the man shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 She identified Michael F. Griffin in court but said that, at the time of the 
shooting last March 10, she was about 200 feet away and was unable to see who 
his target was. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin, 32, an anti-abortion activist, is accused of shooting Dr. David Gunn, 
47, of Eufaula, Ala., three times in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunn was shot when he arrived for work at the back of Pensacola Women's 
Medical Services while an anti-abortion demonstration was being held in front 
of the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey, who worked at a shop in the same commercial complex, is expected to 
be the only prosecution witness claiming actually to have seen the gun being 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are expected to say they saw Griffin behind the clinic just after the 
shooting or watched him drop a revolver near Gunn's body. 
</P>
<P>
 On cross-examination, Lindsey denied suggestions by defense lawyer Robert 
Kerrigan that she only presumed Griffin was the shooter because she saw him a 
few minutes later in a police car, after he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial was interrupted briefly Tuesday when Griffin approached Circuit 
Judge John Parnham during a break and complained that Assistant State Atty. 
James Murray was signaling prosecution witnesses by nodding his head and 
looking over the top of his glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray denied the allegation, saying he looked over the top of his glasses to 
see distant objects. Kerrigan said he had not noticed any signaling.

LANDFILL GETS EXTENSION DESPITE NUNS' PROTEST; ENVIRONMENT: BOARD SAYS 
SANITATION DISTRICT MUST WORK TO RESOLVE SOME OF BAILARD DUMP'S PROBLEMS OR 
RISK ITS CLOSURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite health concerns and other issues raised by a group of nuns who 
neighbor the Bailard Landfill in Oxnard, the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors voted Tuesday to extend for three more years the life of the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than four hours of debate, the board voted 4 to 1 to keep the dump 
open. Supervisor John K. Flynn, whose district the landfill is in, opposed the 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
 The nuns of Sister Servants of Mary argued that the noise, odor and dust from 
the landfill were a health risk. They asked the board to force the Regional 
Sanitation District, the dump's operator, to pay for their relocation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Nieves Consel, 88, who has served in the order for 69 years, said that 
those who come to the Oxnard convent for religious training spend a lot of time 
outdoors, and that she worries that their health may be harmed because of the 
dump. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am pleading with you to relocate the sisters," Consel said. "I'm not asking 
for me, because I am old and will die in not too many years, but for the young 
sisters. Take care of them so they can take care of the sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Showing their support, more than 50 nuns, many of them from the order's 
Newbury Park convalescent hospital, crowded the board's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Agreeing that the nuns' concerns must be addressed, the board ordered the 
Regional Sanitation District to work out an agreement over the next 45 days to 
resolve some of the problems or risk closure of the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 While sympathizing with the nuns, most of the board members Tuesday said there 
was no practical alternative immediately available for dealing with the more 
than 1,000 tons of trash dumped daily at Bailard other than to keep the 
landfill open. 
</P>
<P>
 But Flynn accused his fellow supervisors of lacking leadership for failing to 
come up with another solution, reserving especially harsh words for Supervisor 
Maria VanderKolk. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's just as phony as hell," he said in an interview after the meeting. 
"Claiming to be an environmentalist and then voting for a landfill on a river." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, VanderKolk said her decision was a matter of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any other choice," she said before her vote. "We all want to 
close Bailard, but it's a matter of what's reasonable. Hopefully we can come up 
with a alternative in the next 3 1/2 years." 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly three decades of living near the dump, the nuns argued that the 
odor and noise generated from the 180-acre landfill had become unbearable and 
presented the board with a petition with 9,000 signatures demanding that the 
landfill be closed or the convent be relocated at county expense. The nuns 
recently hired an attorney to assist them in their fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not interested in money," said Stanley Cohen, the Oxnard attorney 
representing the nuns. "Our primary concerns are that the impacts of extending 
the dump be mitigated. Right now, I don't see how they can mitigate the impacts 
without moving the sisters." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said he was not surprised by the board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really had already made up their mind about extending the dump," he 
said. "The question now is whether the (sanitation) district is prepared to 
relocate the nuns." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the two sides can come to an agreement is still an open question. 
While sanitation district officials said they would abide by the board's order 
to work out an agreement with the nuns, they also said they would not pay for 
their permanent relocation. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as we make a reasonable offer and negotiate in good faith, I'm sure 
that we can work something out with the nuns, but permanent relocation is not 
an acceptable alternative," said Mark Zirbel, an attorney representing the 
sanitation district. He said the district could not afford to pay for such a 
move.

 Zirbel and Clint Whitney, general manager of the sanitation district, argued 
to the board that the landfill met every existing environmental standard. They 
said they believed that building a sound wall around the convent and installing 
an air filter inside the building could solve the nuns' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Consel said such measures would only make the nuns feel like 
prisoners because they would be forced to stay inside their convent.

HOT SPELL BRINGS A SUMMER PREVIEW; WEATHER: HIGH-PRESSURE CONDITION CREATES 
UNSEASONAL HEAT WAVE. VENTURA BREAKS RECORD FOR DATE WITH 84.

 From Thousand Oaks to Ventura, residents sought shade and cold drinks Tuesday 
as an unusual hot spell caused record high temperatures across Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday was the hottest day of the year so far, and today promises to be even 
warmer, said Bruce Entwistle, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service 
in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The temperatures are going to stay pretty warm," he said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura was the county's hottest community Tuesday with a high of 84, a record 
for the date, said Tom Johnston, a private climatologist who studies Ventura 
County weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard's high of 83 was also a record, while Ojai and Thousand Oaks recorded 
temperatures of 82 and 81 degrees, respectively, National Weather Service 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Thousand Oaks, Santa Paula and Ojai are expected to be the hot spots at 
85 degrees, while the coastal regions cool off to the mid- to upper 70s -- 
still above normal. 
</P>
<P>
 A high-pressure condition is creating the unseasonal heat wave, which may last 
through the weekend, Entwistle said. However, forecasters said sea breezes that 
would drop the high temperatures back into the 70s could blow in Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's warm weather prompted Thousand Oaks resident Paula Osterbrink to 
have a picnic with her daughter, 4-year-old Ali. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is a beautiful day," said Osterbrink, who had spread out a feast of 
sandwiches, salad and cheese on a lawn at Cal Lutheran University. "It's always 
been in the back of my mind to come here. I thought it would be nice to have a 
picnic." 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Mataisz and Eric Bryant, also Thousand Oaks residents, set Tuesday 
aside for spring-cleaning -- of their horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been wanting to do this for a long time, but you can't do it when it's 
cold," Mataisz said while soaping her dirty white horse, Shandu, in their 
driveway. "We're trying to turn this brown horse white again." 
</P>
<P>
 Mataisz said she was surprised by the sudden heat wave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sweating this morning at 10 a.m.," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Paula, Sue Ricards and her 8-year-old son, Joseph, headed to Foster's 
Freeze, both for the ice cream and the air conditioning. A 47-year resident of 
Santa Paula, Ricards said she can't recall such a hot spell in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't remember any time where we've had such a short cold season," she 
said. "Being this hot this early on, it's more like June." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Kotake Farms strawberry ranch in Camarillo, workers tucked red and blue 
bandannas under baseball caps to keep the blazing sun off the back of their 
necks and guzzled water to keep cool. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's not windy, it makes it hard for us," Maricruz Ruiz said while wiping 
sweat from her forehead. Ruiz said many workers began to feel faint Tuesday 
because of the sudden heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Agricultural meteorologist Terry Schaeffer said the hot weather will mature 
the county's strawberry crops faster than normal, which could be problematic 
because berry prices are currently low. 
</P>
<P>
 But other crops in the county would not be affected by the warming trend, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Water-wise, we're in real good shape. We have to realize we're in a semiarid 
climate. . . . We have to take the wet weather when we get it," he said, adding 
that the county still needs more rain before summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the clear skies and hot sun that blanketed the county Tuesday, 
Schaeffer was optimistic. "If we get two to three inches in March, we should be 
in pretty good shape," he said.

OXNARD COUNCIL OKS CHANGES IN ANTI-GRAFFITI LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a flurry of 11th-hour protests, the Oxnard City Council gave final 
approval Tuesday to tough new measures requiring property owners to promptly 
erase graffiti or face criminal penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the amendments to the city's anti-graffiti ordinance, property owners 
can be fined up to $500 for failing to remove graffiti after being ordered to 
do so by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Half a dozen property owners urged the council to strike that provision from 
the city law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't take it out on the taxpayers," 75-year-old Inez Brown told council 
members. "Common sense will tell you I'm not supposed to pay for somebody 
else's dirty work." 
</P>
<P>
 Added businessman Alvin Aggen: "You are destroying property values. You are 
destroying everything that is good for business in Oxnard." 
</P>
<P>
 But council members, who unanimously adopted the new measures without comment, 
said after the meeting that aggressive action is needed to slow the spread of 
graffiti, an inner-city plague that robs the Oxnard treasury of $600,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The fines could help the city recoup the costs of removing graffiti. But 
council members said the last thing they want to do is penalize property owners 
victimized by graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's primarily designed to get the attention of people who ignore our pleas 
to cooperate," Councilman Michael Plisky said of the new measures. "If this 
thing becomes even slightly abusive, I will immediately bring it back for 
reconsideration." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Mayor Manuel Lopez: "The last thing we want to do is punish the 
victims." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard joins other Ventura County cities that in recent years have adopted 
tough anti-graffiti laws. 
</P>
<P>
 From Thousand Oaks to Moorpark to Ventura, city officials have adopted 
ordinances requiring merchants to lock up spray paint, markers and other tools 
used by graffiti artists. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, a law adopted earlier this year holds parents liable for up to 
$10,000 in damages and fines resulting from their children's vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo City Council last year adopted a law that enables the city to 
hold parents liable and allows the city manager to give property owners 48 
hours to remove graffiti or pay the city for its removal. 
</P>
<P>
 The amendments approved Tuesday in Oxnard broaden the scope of the city's 
anti-graffiti regulations and clarify some of the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the amended ordinance, adults and minors are prohibited from possessing 
in public places objects that could be used for graffiti. In addition, the law 
prohibits the sale of spray paint and other graffiti paraphernalia to minors 
without an adult being present. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the provision of the law that allowed property owners to be fined 
if they failed to promptly erase graffiti that drew criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that provision, the city manager can order the removal of graffiti from 
private property. At that point, a property owner would have 10 days to erase 
the blight. If the property owner fails to do so, he can be fined $100 for the 
first offense, $200 for the second and $500 for each subsequent violation. 
</P>
<P>
 The city supplies rollers and buckets of paint to property owners who wish to 
erase graffiti themselves. The city will also remove the scrawl from homes and 
businesses and charge according to the amount of damage. 
</P>
<P>
 After the council approved the first reading of the ordinance two weeks ago, 
residents began to complain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get up from your full-time jobs, look around and see what needs to be done," 
resident Jean Joneson told council members Tuesday. "This garbage here, what 
you're doing is uncalled-for." 
</P>
<P>
 But other residents told the council that they support the tough measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "This ordinance will give the City Council the kind of leverage they need to 
go after these vandals," said John Branthoover, who heads a community patrol in 
Oxnard's Rio Lindo neighborhood.

SHERIFF, D. A. TO GET MOST OF TAX FUNDS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: COUNTY'S FIRE CHIEF 
CRITICIZES SUPERVISORS' DISTRIBUTION OF THE EXPECTED $26 MILLION IN PROP. 172 
REVENUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ignoring pleas from the Ventura County Fire Department, the Board of 
Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously agreed to devote more than 90% of an 
expected $26 million in special sales tax revenue to law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 County Fire Chief George Lund had asked the supervisors to give $5.5 million 
to his department, saying voters had intended that some of the tax money go to 
firefighters when Proposition 172 was approved in November. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Lund walked out of the supervisors' meeting in disgust, board members 
agreed to allocate $24 million from the tax to the sheriff, district attorney, 
public defender and corrections services director. The supervisors will decide 
later how to spend the remaining $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Larry Carpenter, who plans to use a large portion of the money for the 
new county jail near Santa Paula, said the supervisors showed "some real 
courage." 
</P>
<P>
 "They've done what a lot of people thought they would not do," said Carpenter, 
whose department will receive nearly $17 million from the tax next year. "They 
have struck a real blow for safe streets in Ventura County. A strong blow." 
</P>
<P>
 Lund, however, said later that he felt betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the tax was passed by the greater majority because of the massive 
fires in Southern California," Lund said. "The voters saw our services as part 
of the public safety. But today we are not even considered as part of the 
conversation. . . . I'm extremely disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials defended their decision, saying the Fire Department must make 
its operations more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 A county audit of the Fire Department last year found that the department is 
top-heavy with managers, spends too much on overtime and is lax with sick 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lund disputes the audit's findings, the supervisors have pushed for 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to give the Fire Department any more money until some 
restructuring is done," Supervisor John K. Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maggie Kildee added: "We have a very good Fire Department. . . . 
But they have to come to us with a plan that outlines the best way to provide 
services." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria E. VanderKolk said she believes that law enforcement should 
be the top priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I hear about is crime," VanderKolk said. "We can argue about why 
Proposition 172 was passed." Referring to a Northern California girl who was 
kidnaped and slain last year, VanderKolk added, "I think Polly Klaas may have 
been on the minds of voters too." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since voters agreed to make permanent a half-cent sales tax to shore up 
the budgets of local public safety agencies, the lobbying efforts for the funds 
have been fierce. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unprecedented move, members of the county's criminal justice system 
banded together and submitted a request for the $24 million last week. Lund 
quickly drafted his own plea for $5.5 million, money he hoped to use to restore 
19 positions eliminated last year because of budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 And leaders of Ventura County's 10 cities sent a letter to the board asking 
for $2.6 million for other law enforcement efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the supervisors voted as they had promised, giving the money to 
the crime fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have mixed emotions," said Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo, who 
lobbied Tuesday on the cities' behalf for a slice of the funds. "I'm happy the 
criminal justice agencies got what they had asked for. However, the citizens of 
the cities are going to be mighty disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people in Thousand Oaks voted for this because they wanted more police 
services. I don't see us getting any more police services," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But county law enforcement officials say the cities will reap the benefits 
from the expanded services. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter, whose department provides law enforcement services to half of the 
county's cities, said he plans to hire 92 deputies, trainees and a technician. 
He said he also will use $10 million to operate the new Todd Road Jail, 
scheduled to open next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Defender Kenneth I. Clayman, whose office will receive $746,105, said 
he plans to hire five attorneys, two investigators, two law clerks and a social 
worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will enable us to keep up," Clayman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Frank C. Woodson, corrections services agency director, will 
receive $2 million for his department. The money will be used to hire 41 
employees, primarily probation officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said his office, which will receive about $2 
million, plans to add 33 positions, including 11 attorneys and six 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to make a difference in this county," Bradbury said. "We have been 
losing ground badly for the last four years. It's been held together with 
baling wire and chewing gum. But this is going to get us back like 
gangbusters."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CITY ASKED TO STUDY SMOKING ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council on Tuesday ordered a review of the city's smoking 
ordinance to determine whether it needs to be beefed up in the wake of concerns 
over secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of Mayor Manuel Lopez, council members unanimously agreed to 
ask city staff members to study the issue and bring back a report next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are five cities that have recently upgraded their smoking ordinances 
and the county has likewise upgraded its ordinance," Lopez said. "I would like 
to request that we schedule a study session to review our ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
 Five cities in the county have approved tough new regulations since July, when 
Moorpark prohibited smoking in restaurants, public buildings and in the 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Camarillo City Council approved an ordinance that would bar 
smoking in all public areas except bars and some hotel rooms. The council must 
approve the ordinance at a second reading for it to become law. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard's existing ordinance, approved in 1988, gives employers the right to 
decide whether to allow smoking in the workplace. It prohibits smoking in 
office restrooms, lounges and reception areas but does not regulate smoking in 
restaurants, stores and other establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said he raised the issue after residents continued to express concerns 
about the danger of secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to compare it to the other cities and see if we need to take any 
further action," he said. FRED ALVAREZ

 It's official: The Cameroon Indomitable Lions will prepare for the 1994 World 
Cup soccer championships at Oxnard College. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federation Internationalle de Football Assn. last week formally approved 
Oxnard College as a training site for the soccer team from Cameroon, one of 
three African nations participating in this summer's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard city and college officials are scheduled to meet with Cameroon 
representatives today at the college. The team's 35 players, coaches and 
trainers are expected to arrive in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity to put the city of Oxnard and Oxnard College on the 
world map," Mayor Manuel Lopez said. "We hope that the economic opportunities 
afforded to the city will benefit our hotels, restaurants and retail 
businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard College was chosen last week as a training venue along with Cal State 
Fullerton, Loyola Marymount University and UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, workers and volunteers have transformed an open field at the 
college into a world-class soccer field. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameroon, a French-speaking nation on the coast of West Africa, was one of the 
most popular teams of the last World Cup competition, held four years ago in 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 300 nations will participate in the World Cup event, held every four 
years since 1930. This is the first time that the United States has hosted the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rose Bowl in Pasadena will be one of nine sites nationwide holding the 
soccer matches from June 17 to July 17. FRED ALVAREZ

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: BID FOR HOME-BUYING ASSISTANCE OPPOSED

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying the money should be used for downtown housing instead, the Ventura City 
Council decided early Tuesday against spending $1 million for down payment 
assistance to low- and moderate-income home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing assistance program, which was proposed by Councilwoman Rosa Lee 
Measures, would have provided down payment help to about 40 families.Eligible 
residents would have received up to $30,000 in loans and would have to put down 
a minimum of 5% of the value of the home from their own funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't move, we will lose the opportunity because interest rates are 
beginning to go back up," Measures said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also had the backing of Councilmen Jack Tingstrom and Jim Monahan, 
but the remaining council members rejected it because they would rather have 
the money go for multiunit housing in the downtown area, which city leaders are 
trying to revitalize. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should put our money where our mouth is," said Councilman Gregory L. 
Carson, who advocated that the money be spent for downtown. "I'm not willing at 
this point to commit that money to help 40 people buy houses." 
</P>
<P>
 When Measures realized that Carson, Councilmen Gary Tuttle and Steve Bennett 
and Mayor Tom Buford intended to vote against her proposal, she withdrew the 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1 million comes from money left over after the city recently paid off 
housing bonds. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; COUNCIL OKS RULES TO REGULATE CABLE RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura city leaders have adopted a set of rules that will allow officials to 
regulate cable television rates later, if they wish. 
</P>
<P>
 The action Monday night allows the city to receive federal certification as a 
body capable of regulating local cable rates for basic-tier service. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal guidelines stipulate both consumer and cable company rights should 
the city decide to step in and regulate basic cable rates. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a majority of the council members said they have reservations about 
actually becoming the regulatory agency for basic cable rates. Some who were 
opposed to regulation said they voted in favor of adopting the guidelines to 
keep their options open in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Buford voted against the measure, and council members Jack 
Tingstrom, Gregory L. Carson and Rosa Lee Measures said they are not willing to 
spend city funds on the regulation. Councilman Gary Tuttle said he is still in 
favor of regulating but has serious reservations about the cost and may later 
drop the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Steve Bennett and Jim Monahan are the strongest proponents for 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the marketplace is restricted from functioning, we need the government 
as a regulator," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials estimate that 60% to 65% of Ventura's 35,546 households 
subscribe to one of the two cable companies that receive a franchise from the 
city. PEGGY Y. LEE

<P>
 After months of looking for a tenant, the Ventura City Council has approved a 
10-year lease for a restaurant and retail operation at the end of California 
Street across from the Holiday Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 The council Monday approved leasing the three-store, 5,800-square-foot complex 
to three local businessmen who hope to install a restaurant and retail shops 
this summer at the site of the former Charlie's Seaside Cafe & Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Wachter, one of the new tenants, said he envisions a bistro-type 
restaurant that will serve light fare. He owns and operates Eric Ericsson's at 
the end of Seaward Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Several retail shops operated by Chuck Smith, who owns K. B. Roberts downtown, 
are also planned. Officials at the C Street Surfing Museum, which is already in 
the complex, are negotiating with Wachter, Smith and developer Tom Wood about 
whether they will stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the lease, the trio will provide at least $300,000 worth of 
tenant improvements in the building by Sept. 1. In return, they will not have 
to pay the city about two years worth of rent. Rent will be about $4,850 per 
month, or 4% of the gross receipts, whichever is higher. In the sixth lease 
year, the rent will increase by $308 per month. 
</P>
<P>
 If tenant improvements are not done by Sept. 1, rent will be charged at 
$30,000 per month, City Atty. Peter D. Bulens said. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CITY COUNCIL DROPS BUS ROUTE TO OJAI

<P>
 The Ventura City Council has decided to cut bus service from Ventura to Ojai 
but will keep a route from Buenaventura Mall to Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 City Transportation Engineer Nazir Lalani, who recommended dropping both 
routes, said too few people use the two lines, which cost the city nearly 
$150,000 a year to operate. 
</P>
<P>
 The fares from the Ojai bus line make up about 4% of its costs, and the fares 
from the Ventura Harbor line make up about 8% of its costs, Lalani said. The 
city's goal is to subsidize only 80% of a bus line's operation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council decided unanimously Monday to keep the bus route to Ventura 
Harbor because some residents who regularly travel that way pleaded with city 
leaders to retain it. No one spoke against dropping bus service to Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 "We depend on the bus to get us to the bank," said Beverly Decara, who opposed 
the cut.  
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Mayor Tom Buford said: "I think we're asking for trouble if we sit 
here and eliminate a route with two days notice." PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; WOMAN'S ESTATE TO BENEFIT 3 AGENCIES

<P>
 The dying wish of an Oxnard woman stricken with a debilitating rheumatic 
disease will help three Ventura County charitable agencies continue their work 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medical Resource Foundation, the Boys & Girls Club Foundation of Ventura 
and the Arthritis Foundation of Ventura County have each received $165,000 from 
the estate of Marilyn Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed, 68, died in April after being bedridden for several years with 
dermatomyositis, an arthritis-like disease of the connective tissues. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a very extraordinary person and wanted to make a difference," said 
Millie Schofield, executive director of the Ventura-based Medical Resource 
Foundation. The gift to the Boys & Girls Club Foundation will ensure that the 
club can continue serving young people ages 5 to 19. The gift to the local 
branch of the Arthritis Foundation will help fund research on dermatomyositis 
as well as support the foundation's services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medical Resource Foundation supports special programs of the Ventura 
County Medical Center, with a focus in recent years on newborns, infants and 
children. FRED ALVAREZ

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER BRIDGE REPLACEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing safety concerns, the Moorpark City Council tonight will consider 
whether to spend about $2.5 million to replace an elevated portion of Spring 
Road that runs across the Arroyo Simi. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only a matter of time before that bridge gives way," Councilman Scott 
Montgomery said."The engineering and style of architecture was built for a time 
when the arroyo was far less of a massive force than it is now" during heavy 
rains. 
</P>
<P>
 While officials with the state Department of Transportation have advised the 
city that the two-lane bridge need only be rehabilitated, council members say 
they are convinced that replacement makes more sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bridge has the characteristic of accumulating a lot of debris and 
causing the water to rise up and over the road, creating what we all feel is a 
pretty hazardous situation," Mayor Paul Lawrason said. 
</P>
<P>
 About $506,000 of the replacement costs may come from federal grants, 
officials said, and the city now has $567,000 in hand to devote to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Replacing the bridge would also allow the city to widen its two lanes of 
traffic and add a bicycle/pedestrian lane, Lawrason said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do support replacing it," he said. "But I also am concerned about the total 
cost and where the money's coming from." 
</P>
<P>
 The council will discuss whether to move ahead with the replacement and 
sources of additional funds, such as issuance of bonds, borrowing or seeking 
contributions from developers with land in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will begin at 7 p.m. at Moorpark City Hall, 799 Moorpark Ave.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; 11 INDICTED AFTER COCAINE DRUG BUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal grand jury has indicted 11 people in a three-year cocaine and 
money-laundering investigation that began in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictments were issued Tuesday, naming the first of dozens of suspects 
taken into custody as a result of the undercover operation organized by the 
Ventura County Sheriff's Department and the Oxnard office of the U.S. Customs 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the suspects live in Ventura County, but one of them, Ruben Dario 
Mendez-Reascos, was responsible for the shipment of 200 kilograms of cocaine to 
Thousand Oaks on Jan. 12, the indictment says. 
</P>
<P>
 Undercover agents had been hired by Mendez-Reascos to take the cocaine to 
Detroit and exchange it for $800,000 in cash to be laundered through U.S. bank 
accounts, said Sgt. Gary Pentis, who supervised much of the case. Instead, 
investigators seized the cocaine and traded phony drugs for the money in 
Detroit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendez-Reascos is in federal custody in Detroit and is expected to be brought 
to Los Angeles, Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other suspects named in the indictment were Fernando Barrera-Saavedra, 
Guillermo Ruiz, Shawn Michael Perry, Lexiea Underwood, Anthony Duane Vinson, 
Mark Langenhahn, George Drakopoulos and Lacides L. Angarita. A man and a woman 
from Los Angeles were also indicted, but they have not been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrera-Saavedra is a resident of Bogota and remains in Colombia. The other 
eight suspects were taken into custody late last year or in January in Detroit, 
Chicago or Houston, Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, which began with a Thousand Oaks informant in October, 1991, led to 
the largest cash seizure of any Ventura County investigation and the 
second-largest seizure of cocaine. Authorities said $5.8 million in cash has 
been confiscated, along with nearly 1,000 pounds of cocaine. JULIE FIELDS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; INSTITUTE'S LODGE FACES WRECKING BALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A historic lodge near Simi Valley that served as a central office for the 
Brandeis-Bardin Institute until its near-collapse during the Jan. 17 earthquake 
will fall to the wrecking ball, a county historical board has decided. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maier house, built in 1914 by beer-maker Henry Maier, was approved for 
demolition by the Ventura County Historical Heritage Board after officials from 
the institute said it would be too costly to repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Constructed of river rock and hollow, plaster-covered brick, the two-story 
Spanish-style house buckled during the quake, a glass atrium at its center 
crumbling to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's absolutely no way you can put something back together that is so 
shattered," said board member and Simi Valley historian Patricia Havens. "It 
would be like trying to put together a broken teacup and trusting it to hold 
hot tea." 
</P>
<P>
 The house was purchased in 1947 by noted educator Shlomo Bardin to house the 
Jewish educational center he had founded six years earlier with Supreme Court 
Justice Louis D. Brandeis. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Jewish people from around the world gather at the center each year 
for programs on religion and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute plans to raze the Maier house and construct a new center in its 
place, said Jeremy Barnett, assistant director of administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old house had a lot of good memories," he said. "But it's the people who 
really bring value to the institute." SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; PANEL VOTES AGAINST WIDENING OF ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks Planning Commission has agreed to recommend that a stretch 
of Reino Road not be expanded from two to four lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission voted 4 to 1 Monday night to recommend that the City Council 
reject the widening.The move would allow the city to add amenities to a 
half-mile stretch of the roadway north of Potrero Road, including a bicycle 
path and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Cancellation of the road widening is the first of many proposed revisions to 
the city's 25-year General Plan forwarded to the commission by the General Plan 
Review Committee, made up of city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The section of Reino Road, which would have to be rezoned under the 
commission's recommendation to keep its two-lane status, connects with a larger 
four-lane section. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Commissioner Mervyn Kopp, who voted against the proposal, said it 
could create a safety hazard to keep the roadway as it is. He compared the 
quick switch from four lanes to two lanes to Kanan Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us that Kanan Road had been engineered beautifully, and there are a 
lot of deaths on Kanan Road," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City traffic engineers told the commission that the road would safely 
accommodate future traffic with two lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Marilyn Carpenter, a member of the General Plan Review Committee, 
urged the commission to follow the committee's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 "At no time would the committee recommend something that is unsafe," she said. 
"And I feel that this recommendation is consistent with the strong views of the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Debate on other recommended changes to the General Plan involving Nedjatollah 
Cohan's property along Reino was postponed until March 21. MATTHEW MOSK

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; CHANGES STUDIED IN LAW REVIEW PROCESS 
</P>

<P>
 Hoping to avoid sometimes embarrassing lapses in the city's review of proposed 
ordinances, the Moorpark City Council tonight will consider a new procedure 
guaranteeing proper scrutiny of local laws before they are adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to tighten up the process, so it's very clear to everyone that's 
involved in the process what the steps are, so it always follows the same 
steps," Mayor Paul Lawrason said."It's easy in preparing one of those to leave 
something out or not get it reviewed by the lawyer before they bring it to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members have been left shaking their heads in amazement at times over 
the past year when told that proposed laws on the brink of adoption had not 
been given a full review by staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to become more efficient in conducting our business," Councilman 
Bernardo Perez said. "Too many times in the past, and possibly in our haste to 
initiate action, we weren't as ready as we thought for certain items, primarily 
ordinances." 
</P>
<P>
 The new procedure ensures that every proposed ordinance receives a full review 
by staff members, the city manager and city attorney before finding its way to 
the council dais. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider the policy at its meeting beginning at 7 p.m. at 
Moorpark City Hall, 799 Moorpark Ave. JAMES MAIELLA JR.

FATHER, SON BURIED IN QUIET CAMARILLO RITES; FUNERAL: ABOUT 300 ATTEND SERVICES 
FOR STEVEN GOLLY AND CHRISTOPHER, 17, WHO KILLED THREE, INCLUDING A POLICE 
OFFICER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A minister told mourners who gathered Tuesday for the funeral of Christopher 
Golly that the Northridge teen-ager should not be remembered solely for "the 
last chapter" of his life -- the shooting rampage in which he killed his 
father, a policewoman and himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "A person's life cannot be summed up in the events of one day," the Rev. 
Craige Le Breton told about 300 people crowded into a chapel for the private 
funeral for Christopher and his father, Steven, at Conejo Mountain Memorial 
Park in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We remember not simply the last chapter. We remember all the chapters that 
came before." 
</P>
<P>
 The quiet ceremony was in stark contrast with one attended Monday by thousands 
of mourners -- including 3,500 police officers, Gov. Pete Wilson and Los 
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan -- for Los Angeles Police Officer Christy 
Hamilton of Thousand Oaks. Christopher Golly killed Hamilton with one rifle 
shot after he slew his father, then lured police to the Golly home with a 911 
call, before committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 While Hamilton was honored with a 21-gun salute and remembered as a brave 
woman who had recently achieved her long-held dream of becoming a police 
officer, the eulogy for Christopher Golly, 17, concentrated on his promising 
preteen years, before he developed emotional problems and became a heavy user 
of Methedrine, or "speed." 
</P>
<P>
 Le Breton referred to Christopher Even Golly as a "Bicentennial baby," born in 
1976 and coincidentally the 1,976th baby born at Northridge Hospital Medical 
Center. He said Christopher was an honors student at Pinecrest School. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a quiet person," the pastor said. "He was creative in writing. He 
wrote poetry." 
</P>
<P>
 Family friends have said in interviews that Christopher began to change four 
years ago when his mother died of a cocaine overdose. He became lax in his 
schoolwork, was eventually put in a special program for troubled students and 
was convicted of marijuana possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Ray Golly, 47, was remembered by Le Breton as a native of Los Angeles 
who began his successful career in the electrical supply business after a brief 
stint in the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 (Although friends earlier described Golly as a Vietnam veteran, service 
records obtained by The Times showed that Golly was discharged before 
completing boot camp.) 
</P>
<P>
 Le Breton noted that Steven was known to his friends as hospitable and a great 
cook, but also as a man who had "strong opinions." 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps, we might sum it up by saying that he was a man who expected much of 
himself and of many others," the pastor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship between father and son deteriorated in recent years, friends 
say, with Christopher threatening his father. The one recreation they enjoyed 
together was target practice in Angeles National Forest with the guns in 
Steven's collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher used a semiautomatic rifle his father had given him to kill both 
Steven and Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other speaker at the half-hour service was Christopher's friend, 
James Gates, who said in a voice cracking with emotion that "no matter what I 
was up against," he could count on Christopher for support. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members at the funeral included Steven's mother, Eleanor, who lives in 
Camarillo, and his sister, Karen Wharton, who lives in La Crescenta. Also 
attending were the other three people in the house when the rampage began -- 
Susan Bever, Steven's girlfriend for the past three years; her son, Aaron 
Bever, and Aaron's girlfriend, Connie McGovern. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven and Christopher were laid to rest in identical caskets in adjoining 
graves. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's pallbearers included several of his close friends, including 
Alon Karpovsky of Granada Hills. "I was keeping myself from thinking of the 
memories we shared because I would most likely cry," Karpovsky, 16, said after 
the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking, 'I am carrying Chris in my hand.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the ceremony, several of Christopher's friends climbed into a 
van in front of the chapel to change from their dark, comparatively formal 
outfits into shorts and T-shirts, then cranked up rap music on the stereo and 
headed for the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 As they left, Karpovsky considered what he would say to Christopher if his 
friend was still alive. "I'd say, 'Dude, keep on fighting, don't quit,' " 
Karpovsky said.

COUNTY OFFICIALS PLAN EXPERIMENT WITH 1-STOP SOCIAL SERVICE CENTERS; 
GOVERNMENT: THE LOCATIONS WILL IMITATE FEDERALLY RUN DISASTER FACILITIES BY 
GIVING RESIDENTS ACCESS TO SEVERAL AGENCIES AT ONCE. 
</P>

 Thrown together at disaster aid centers by the earthquake, Ventura County 
social services officials said Tuesday that they will try to stay together 
after the recovery to serve the public better. 
</P>
<P>
 County Public Social Services Agency officials said they plan to spend an 
anticipated $7.5-million federal disaster aid grant to open full-time, one-stop 
social service centers in Simi Valley and Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 The centers will imitate federally run disaster centers by giving residents 
access to several county agencies at once -- including those handling mental 
health, public health, welfare and job counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 If the centers work well for the estimated 18-month life of the grant, 
officials would seek federal, state and county money keep them open and set up 
others in cities around Ventura County, said Barbara Fitzgerald, chief deputy 
director of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing this as the model for the future," Fitzgerald said. "We've 
always talked about a multi-service center. . . . But this gets us to do it 
earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 The social services department heads agreed Tuesday at their weekly meeting 
that if the experiment works, they will try to make the one-stop centers 
permanent, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Benedetto, disaster coordinator for the county Department of Mental 
Health, said the one-stop centers could bring counseling and other services to 
mental health clients and disaster victims who might not seek such help 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that it would help by providing an informal counseling atmosphere" 
for disaster victims who are seeking help from other county agencies, Benedetto 
said. "People who normally would not want to come into a therapist's office . . 
. would be more willing to come in to get services and, in a very informal way, 
to be able to talk to someone about the stress they have in terms of the 
earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 As recovery from the quake winds down, the one-stop centers could help welfare 
recipients get job counseling, for example. Immunizations, medical checkups and 
other public health services could also be provided. 
</P>
<P>
 And mental health caseworkers could steer their clients to other agencies for 
help with food and housing, Benedetto said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these people don't know how to get these services because they're 
afraid" of officials due to their illness, he said. "We would just walk them 
over, and we would stay with them while they fill out the form. . . . We'd be 
able to be a coach for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald said the centers would also include counselors from the county 
Office of Alcohol and Drug Programs and caseworkers for county programs on 
adult abuse and in-home support for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of a holistic approach to human services," she said of the centers, 
which could be set up in Fillmore and Simi Valley within a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is where they will be housed. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaster coordinators for Supervisors Maggie Kildee and Vicky Howard are 
looking for county office space, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
 If county-owned space cannot be found, the agencies will have to consider 
renting other space, said Melody Rafelson, an aide to Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 The search may be especially difficult in Fillmore, where so much of the 
business district was damaged in the earthquake, said Kathy Long, an aide to 
Kildee. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the centers are set up, however, they could help provide services to the 
public more quickly in case of another disaster, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the pilot's successful . . . and cost-effective, what you'd have in place 
is a system," Long said. "All you'd need to do is increase the volume of 
staffing in case of disaster."

GOVERNOR HELPS TO DEDICATE AMGEN LAB; THOUSAND OAKS: AT $50-MILLION RESEARCH 
FACILITY, WILSON SAYS VISIT UNDERSCORES COMMITMENT TO SMALL BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Amgen scientists gave Gov. Pete Wilson a science lesson Tuesday as he donned a 
lab coat and toured a biotechnology laboratory at the dedication of the 
Thousand Oaks company's new $50-million research facility. 
</P>
<P>
 After examining tiny protein crystals through a microscope and listening to a 
brief explanation of molecular structures, the governor stepped out of the lab 
and into a more comfortable position -- in front of an audience of 1,800 Amgen 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can hardly wait to call my 92-year-old father and tell him that I've been 
looking inside molecules," Wilson quipped. "He'll say, 'Son, I told you you 
shouldn't drink in the morning.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson told the employees that his visit to Amgen's headquarters underscores a 
commitment to small business in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to help small businesses grow and not snuff them out," he said. 
"Because when they grow, they become Amgen." 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen was founded in Thousand Oaks in 1980 and is now the largest independent 
biotechnology firm in the world. The company reported annual revenues last year 
of $1.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The new research building, which is on the perimeter of the company's 100-acre 
property at the west end of the city, will create space for about 300 
researchers and scientists and 150 support personnel, Amgen officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The research performed in the new building may lead to treatments for a number 
of diseases, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, Amgen officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientist Timothy Ossland, who recently moved into the 185,000-square-foot 
building, gave Wilson a half-hour tour of the laboratories and demonstrated how 
the collection of computers, microscopes and robots work. 
</P>
<P>
 Ossland said he was still in awe of the new facility, especially when thinking 
back to 1981, the year he joined the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came here, we worked out of half of a small building," he said. 
"What has happened in 13 years has been astonishing." 
</P>
<P>
 After the tour, Wilson spoke from the ground floor of the building's central 
atrium, where workers crowded around banisters, looking down from two upper 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's really exciting that he came here," said Elizabeth Singer, a 
technician in the lab toured by the governor. "It's nice to be recognized for 
what we do here and to be told that it's important." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to recognizing the workers at the event, Wilson appointed Gordon 
Binder, Amgen's chief executive officer, to a new state council on 
biotechnology. The council will help Wilson encourage growth of the 
biotechnology industry in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Several city officials who attended the event said they were pleased with the 
worldwide attention that Amgen has brought to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 They added, however, that the morning's festivities would not affect the City 
Council's scheduled debate on the company's plans later that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen officials were expected to ask the City Council to approve the firm's 
25-year expansion plan, which would include the construction of several new 
buildings and the creation of 1,500 new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was rejected by the Thousand Oaks Planning Commission last month 
because some of the proposed buildings were considered too tall. But Ed 
Bjurstrom, project manager for the expansion, said he was confident that Amgen 
would reach an agreement with the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council continued to debate Amgen's proposal late into the night Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The building dedicated Tuesday was built before the company's long-term plans 
were completed and is one of several that have been under construction for the 
past year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the ceremony, Wilson praised what he said was Amgen's willingness to invest 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing and forward-thinking companies like Amgen are absolutely crucial to 
California's future," he said.

FRANCES TATE GIBSON; ENCINO PIONEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frances Tate Gibson, who with her husband operated Encino's first grocery 
store and post office more than 50 years ago, has died at a Santa Rosa 
hospital. She was 93. 
</P>
<P>
 An Encino resident for nearly six decades before she retired to Northern 
California with her husband, Mrs. Gibson died Thursday of a degeneration of the 
esophagus, according to a representative of the Sonoma County bureau of vital 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Bakersfield, Mrs. Gibson met her husband, Theo (Ted) Gibson, while 
attending high school in Monrovia. The couple moved from Monrovia to Encino in 
1925. According to Mrs. Gibson's longtime friend, Josie Hendricks, the couple 
ran the community's first grocery store and service station at the corner of 
Ventura Boulevard and Oak Park Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1938, the Gibsons sold the store's contents and established Encino's first 
post office on the site on April 8 of that year. Mr. Gibson served as the 
location's first postmaster until 1946 and later worked in the real estate 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 During World War II, Mrs. Gibson volunteered at Birmingham Hospital (later 
Birmingham High School) in Van Nuys. She was also active in numerous clubs and 
organizations for many years, including the Encino Historical Society, the 
Encino Women's Club and the Encino Republican Club. In the mid-1980s, the 
Gibsons retired to Santa Rosa, Hendricks said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her husband of 72 years, Mrs. Gibson is survived by a grandson. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no services. Lafferty & Smith Colonial Chapel in Santa Rosa handled 
the arrangements, and according to Hendricks, Mrs. Gibson's cremated remains 
will be interred at Oakwood Memorial Park in Chatsworth. Memorial donations may 
be made in Mrs. Gibson's name to the Encino chapter of the Kiwanis Club.

NEWSWIRE: PGA COMMISSIONER BEMAN PLANS TO RESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deane Beman, who presided over a 20-year period of growth and prosperity -- 
and controversy -- has decided to resign as commissioner of the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Beman announced Tuesday he will not seek an extension of his contract, which 
runs through December, 1995.Beman, 55, a former U.S. and British Amateur 
champion and winner of four PGA Tour titles, said he hopes to compete in some 
senior tour events. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard J. Ferris, tournament policy board chairman, said a selection 
committee has been appointed. Beman said he will leave when his successor is 
named. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beman's 20-year reign, tour purses grew from $8.2 million to more than $103 
million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the PGA has enjoyed success under Beman, there were some 
controversies surrounding his administration -- the multimillion dollar suit 
over square-grooved clubs, a highly critical series of articles in Golf Digest, 
a lengthy dispute with leading European players over playing rights and 
responsibilities on the American tour. Miscellany 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. men's volleyball team will play its six-match World Volleyball League 
home schedule at the San Diego Sports Arena. Team USA will play host to Greece 
on May 6 and 8, Bulgaria on May 27-28, and defending Olympic champion Brazil on 
June 3 and 5.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; PIAZZA ADJUSTS TO BIGGER FAN DEMANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With success has come attention, and there is nobody at Dodgertown generating 
more fan interest than catcher Mike Piazza, who is learning to deal with it the 
best he can. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that my job is to play baseball, and above that I try to accommodate 
everybody I can, but it's difficult sometimes," Piazza said Tuesday at Vero 
Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "Undoubtedly people will say that you have changed, but you have to make some 
changes in order to get your job done. I would like to sign autographs for 
everybody, but I can only do the best that I can." 
</P>
<P>
 When Piazza finishes his daily workouts, he usually goes back to his 
condominium on the beach, where he rooms with first baseman Eric Karros and 
pitcher Greg Hansell, and regroups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to take a walk on the beach and do something like feed the sea gulls," 
Piazza said. "It helps to keep my mind simple. Because I know that someday all 
of the fanfare will end, and when it's over, I want to be the same person that 
I was before." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza's recently signed contract, $4.2 million for three years, has set a 
precedent for other players in the organization and also seems to be helping 
players on other clubs, such as Angel outfielder Tim Salmon, who has been 
offered a four-year, $7-million deal.  
</P>
<P>
 The next Dodger player to benefit from Piazza's contract will probably be 
shortstop Jose Offerman, whom the Dodgers are close to signing to a two-year 
contract. Besides Offerman, only pitchers Pedro Astacio and Kip Gross remain 
unsigned. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Under the guidance of hitting coach Reggie Smith, outfielder Darryl Strawberry 
has altered his swing this spring. The wide loop at the start has been 
minimized and the follow-through elongated. The results in batting practice 
have been positive.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the loop, which has been part of Strawberry's trademark swing, 
needed to be reduced because it put added stress on Strawberry's surgically 
repaired back. "I think that's what caused (his back problem) in the first 
place," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Vice President Fred Claire said reports on the condition of 
Strawberry's back are good. "(Team physical therapist) Pat Screnar said the 
Darryl we have known has never been stronger," Claire said. "He put on another 
awesome display today in batting practice, but the most exciting thing is the 
freedom of his swing -- he's not restricted in any way and he is able to swing 
day after day." Claire said that to his knowledge, Strawberry has not 
experienced any new difficulties off the field, adding: "He has worked hard, 
his approach has been great, his attitude gets an A." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Roger Cedeno, a top outfield prospect for the Dodgers, injured a knee while 
sliding in a winter league playoff game a month ago and will have arthroscopic 
surgery later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedeno, who is only 19, has risen through the ranks so quickly that, depending 
on the condition of his knee, he is scheduled to play in Albuquerque this 
season. He is a switch-hitter, mainly for average but with some power, and 
plays both center and left field. MARYANN HUDSON

BOND YIELDS SOAR AS DOW DROPS 22.79 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * Fresh signs of higher inflation Tuesday sent Treasury bond yields soaring to 
eight-month highs, pushing prices sharply lower. 
</P>
<P>
 * The stock market took its cue from the bond market and fell broadly. Credit  
</P>
<P>
 To bond investors already jittery over inflation, a report by the nation's 
purchasing executives prompted wide speculation that the Federal Reserve Board 
could move as early as Friday to raise interest rates again to check price 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 The news sent 30-year bond yields surging to 6.78% from 6.65% on Monday and 
the price, which moves in the opposite direction, down 1 15/32 points, or 
$14.69 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the highest bond yield since it closed at 6.78% on June 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Shorter-term yields posted even sharper gains on expectations of another 
tightening by the Fed, which raised rates on Feb. 4 for the first time in five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Purchasing Management reported an unexpected surge in 
prices last month to the highest level since October, 1990.  
</P>
<P>
 Higher inflation and interest rates tend to reduce the value of bonds, which 
pay a fixed rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchasing managers survey was particularly worrisome to fixed-income 
investors because the Fed has said that such economic indicators now figure 
more importantly in its interest rate decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Another report arousing inflation worries was the Commerce Department's upward 
revision of gross domestic product to 7.5% in the fourth quarter of last year 
from the previous estimate of 5.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Some market participants speculated that the Fed may move again Friday if the 
Labor Department's monthly employment report shows an unexpected rise in the 
nation's payrolls. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 Stocks spent the day solidly lower, although they recovered from their worst 
levels toward the day's end. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average lost 22.79 to 3,809.23 on Big Board volume 
totaling 300 million shares. In the broader market, declining issues 
outnumbered advances by about 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other major market indicators, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks 
fell 2.70 to 464.44, while the NYSE's composite index fell 1.42 to 257.81. The 
Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks lost 3.86 to 788.64. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 Financial stocks tumbled in response to the higher rates, with American 
Express losing 3/8 to 28 7/8 and Travelers falling 1 1/2 to 35 5/8, both in 
active trading. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks were also hit hard, with AST Research falling 2 3/4 to 28 
3/4, Hewlett-Packard slipping 3/4 to 89 7/8 and Intel Corp. off 2 to 66 3/4. 
Bucking the trend was Digital Equipment, which was upgraded to "buy" from 
"hold" by Salomon Bros. and rose 2 1/8 to 31 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among blue chip cyclical stocks, Alcoa shrank 3/4 to 74 1/2, Goodyear Tire 
dropped 1 1/4 to 44, DuPont fell 3/4 to 52 1/2 and International Paper dropped 
1 to 71 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * ShowBiz Pizza Time shrank 1 1/2 to 13 1/2 after it reported a fourth-quarter 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 * Snapple fell 1 3/4 to 27 1/8 after Coca-Cola said it will compete in the 
fruit drink market. 
</P>

 Denver Airport's Opening Delayed: Mayor Wellington Webb, after meeting with 
officials from United and Continental airlines, postponed the opening of Denver 
International Airport to May 15 from March 9. The hang-up is the automated 
system that will move passengers' baggage from the terminal check-in area to 
the planes in the three concourses.Continental Airlines Inc. of Houston and 
Chicago-based UAL Corp.'s United, the major hub operators at Denver, agreed to 
cover the full cost of the delay, estimated at $30 million. It was the third 
delay of the opening of the $3.2-million facility being built to replace the 
city's Stapleton Airport.

 Steelmaker Hit by Strike: About 4,000 members of the United Steelworkers of 
America walked off their jobs at Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. plants in 
three states. It was the company's second labor dispute in nine years. Union 
negotiators said pensions, medical benefits, salaries and retiree insurance 
were some of the sticking points. Wheeling-Pittsburgh, based in Wheeling, W. 
Va., is the nation's eighth-largest company producing steel from scratch. Last 
year, the company performed strongly but still posted a loss of $6.2 million as 
it paid off debt earlier than anticipated. The current, three-year labor 
contract was part of the company's re-emergence from bankruptcy in 1991.

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; AN ANTHOLOGY FROM (AND ABOUT) THE SOUL; SOUL: AN 
ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SPIRIT, READINGS FROM SOCRATES TO RAY CHARLES; EDITED BY 
PHIL COUSINEAU . HARPERSANFRANCISCO $18, 288 PAGES.

 S oul is a four-letter word that carries a crushing accumulation of 
metaphorical baggage, and Phil Cousineau ponders virtually all its meanings in 
"Soul: An Archaeology of the Spirit," an audacious but rewarding anthology of 
poetry, song, fairy tale, meditation, reminiscence, disputation and confession 
that spans a few millennia of human civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 Cousineau, biographer of myth-master Joseph Campbell, set himself the task of 
collecting everything he could find on the subject of the soul and offering it 
up as "a collage of sub-atomic word traces of the soul's movement through us 
and through the world." The whole enterprise is intended to be -- and is -- 
inspiring, often mind-blowing, sometimes even a little scary. 
</P>
<P>
 "To probe the images of the soul as the vital force, the source of 
consciousness, the persistence of things, the core individuality, the depth 
dimension, the raw, blue rhythm of life," writes Cousineau by way of 
introduction, "is to suddenly, with Lear, 'take upon us the mystery of things, 
as if we were God's spies.' " 
</P>
<P>
 No single unifying principle can be discerned in Cousineau's selections, which 
ricochet wildly from Genesis to Gnostic creation myths to the Second Khanda 
Upanishad; from West African folk tales to Dervish poetry to the verses of T.S. 
Eliot; from Aristotle on "The Essential Whatness" to Tracy Kidder on "The Soul 
of the Computer"; from Cicero to William Blake to Ramakrishna; from James Joyce 
to Eldridge Cleaver to Pablo Neruda; from Abelard and Heloise to H.P. Blavatsky 
to Raymond Carver and Alice Walker. 
</P>
<P>
 Cousineau's reach is intentionally (and appropriately) cosmic, and "Soul" is a 
mixed bag of spiritual yearning, theological speculation and intellectual 
curiosity. To the anticipated criticism that his book is a multicultural and 
metaphysical hodgepodge, Cousineau simply shrugs and says: Here it is, take it, 
and make of it what you will. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I'm haunted by vexing questions: Why do I hear Gregorian chant, 
hell-for-leather sermons, and the whiskey-and-smoke voice of Ray Charles 
whenever I hear the very word soul ?" he muses. "Why does this cavernous 
universe within me resound like a cathedral organ reverberating with Bach, the 
three-tone chords of Tibetan monks, and sometimes, in the heat of the night, 
the chilling opening chords of Percy Sledge's soul-piercing 'When a Man Loves a 
Woman'?" 
</P>
<P>
 As if to show us exactly what he means, Cousineau has selected fragments that 
ponder soul in all its disparate and sometimes unrelated meanings. St. Teresa 
of Avila fancies the soul to be an interior castle fashioned of diamond; 
Descartes insists that the "material soul" is seated in the pineal gland of the 
human brain; the American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow rhapsodizes on the 
human voice as "the organ of the soul." And so we are hardly surprised when 
Cousineau throws in a riff on soul music by African American music critic Al 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was soul something like a breeze," he ponders, "something you couldn't 
picture or grab but could only feel like you could the wind off the Gulf when 
the day cooled down. . . ?" 
</P>
<P>
 Cousineau also considers Bruno Bettelheim's argument that the mistranslation 
of Freud's work into English unfairly concealed and distorted Freud's interest 
in "that unknown nether world in which, according to ancient myths, the souls 
of men dwell." And Jung, of course, was unabashed in his celebration of the 
human soul. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should the simple mind deny . . . that the 'soul' lives in a realm beyond 
the body?" Jung wrote. "I must admit that I can see as little nonsense in this 
so-called superstition as in the findings of research regarding heredity or the 
basic instincts." 
</P>
<P>
 Often enough, the readings have less to do with the soul in its classical 
sense than with ideas and experiences that we know by other names: love, 
comfort, inspiration, longing, remorse. Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl, for 
example, recalls how the luminous awareness of his wife's love kept him alive 
in a concentration camp during the Holocaust, and psychologist Sue Nathan 
reveals the shattering emotional repercussions that attended her decision to 
abort her fourth pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Committed to life, not death, having always celebrated my fertility and joy 
in giving birth, I fell into an abyss of despair from which I could see no 
exit," writes Nathan, somehow echoing the confessional literature of the Middle 
Ages as she recalls "a crisis at the deepest center of my being -- a crisis of 
soul -- unlike any other experience of suffering I have encountered." 
</P>
<P>
 And, significantly, Cousineau includes a passage by Albert Schweitzer in which 
the good doctor invokes the soul as a touchstone of moral behavior: "You know 
of the disease in Central Africa called sleeping sickness," he wrote. "There 
also exists a sleeping sickness of the soul." 
</P>
<P>
 Here, I think, is the essence of what Cousineau hopes to accomplish with his 
book. If there is a common theme in the crazy quilt of "Soul," it is a moral 
and spiritual wake-up call, a massive antidote to what Wallace Stegner called 
the "soul-sickness" of contemporary world. 
</P>
<P>
 Against what Cousineau correctly characterizes as the "corrosive loneliness, 
vague purposelessness, and hall-of-mirrors narcissism" of late 20th-Century 
human existence, Cousineau offers a bracing and yet somehow intoxicating brew 
intended to revive us and fortify us. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a postmodern world of instantaneous revisionism of all we hold scared," 
writes Cousineau in defense of his whole marvelous enterprise, "soul is an 
existential anchor for the drifting ship of awareness."

JERRY BROWN GETS A RUSH OUT OF RADIO; MEDIA: THE VETERAN POLITICIAN IS THRIVING 
ON 'WE THE PEOPLE,' HIS NEW TALK SHOW, WHICH IS OFF TO A MODEST START. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A tape of children reciting the preamble to the Constitution fades to silence 
and then former California Gov. Edmund G. "Jerry" Brown Jr. starts to vent. 
</P>
<P>
 "You throw a candy wrapper out of your car window and you get a $500 fine 
because every state in the union has an anti-litter law," he says on "We the 
People," his new radio call-in show. "But a chemical company can get an 
official permit to poison your neighborhood. . . . Industry lobbyists say 
everything's OK, a little cancer is the price of progress, you have to take 
your risks in life. I don't think so. I don't think the government's doing 
enough to protect us. Not when a kid's lungs are being irreparably damaged, 
when breast and prostate cancers are increasing and when the sperm count is 
down, when the forests are dying, when frogs and birds are disappearing all 
over the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty of heat to open a recent edition of his two-hour weekday radio show. 
And little cooling as his outrage turns to acid rain, "reduction of growth 
capacity . . . cancers, allergies, respiratory diseases. . . . It goes on with 
government permission and government knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown entered the crowded talk-radio arena Jan. 31 from a studio in Oakland. 
In a start-up reminiscent of his spartan 1992 campaign for President, his show 
has been picked up by about 30 or so stations, the biggest of which is 
50,000-watt WSSH in Boston. His syndicator, Talk America Radio Network, based 
in Marboro, Mass., counts columnist Jack Anderson as its only other brand-name 
personality. 
</P>
<P>
 However, modest beginnings or not, Brown sounds no less fervent than he did 
when network news teams and leading pundits crowded his trail after he defeated 
Bill Clinton in the 1992 Connecticut primary. He denounces "Pentagon spenders 
and prison builders" and "the corruption of the political class" as if he were 
on the stump once more. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reminded in an interview that he used talk radio effectively in 1992, speaking 
with every backwater station and big-city powerhouse, including the raunchy 
Howard Stern, who endorsed him, Brown said that those on-air skills hardly 
prepared him to host his own show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just feel it's a lot of work, to have a lot of knowledge, to keep talking," 
he said. "But I appreciate the value of the talk-show format. Ideas are 
complicated. The quickie newscasts distort and simplify the issues, but a talk 
show allows you a few hours to really explore the issues. There's a narrative 
in the talk-show format whereas the mainstream media is like acupuncture of 
entertainment and isolation. Your brain is agitated, but your mind is not 
engaged." 
</P>
<P>
 If Brown's swipe at the "mainstream media" echoes that giant of the format, 
Rush Limbaugh, who routinely criticizes the "mainstream media culture," it's 
because the liberal Jerry and the conservative Rush both position their shows 
as alternative forums. As Brown orients himself to his new role, he has been 
struck by Limbaugh's tenacity on issues that the conservative holds important. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "When Limbaugh has a project, he does it justice and it's not glossed over," 
Brown said. "He's been harping on Clinton and Whitewater for about three months 
now. He certainly pounds home an idea. It's pretty incredible. . . . I 
basically define him as a tall-storyteller of rightist perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 Fine. But Limbaugh attracts more than 5 million listeners per quarter-hour by 
enlivening his show with song parodies and other mischief. It is respectfully 
pointed out to Brown that no one will ever accuse him of being a song-and-dance 
man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do have a dry sense of humor," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has passionate callers. One of them knew all about the emissions from 
her local incinerator and the political connections of those who own the 
facility. Another told Brown how "government-regulated hemp technologies," or 
the harvesting of natural fibers, could conserve trees. Brown lingered with 
each, cutting in and out of conversations with "bumpers" of country-rock music. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, whose gubernatorial experience and progressive ideas certainly have 
earned him a place at the roundtable of talk-media meisters, may serve as a 
welcome counterbalance on stations dominated by Limbaugh, G. Gordon Liddy and 
other bullhorns of the right. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's questionable whether he will line up affiliates in many of the top 
markets. A random survey of leading radio executives revealed that they wanted 
to hear Brown's show, even though they were all but certain that it would be 
too arid for their needs. 
</P>
<P>
 At New York's WABC, program director John Mainelli will have the option in May 
of adding ABC Radio's new weekend show featuring Texas populist Jim Hightower. 
Mainelli also noted that he would have tried to hire Mario Cuomo if the New 
York governor had not decided to seek a fourth term this year. Brown may have 
to look elsewhere in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Is he doing the show to prepare for a rematch with Clinton in 1996? Brown 
credits the President with having a "modest impact. He can't stem the drift 
toward greater inequality and environmental deterioration." Then he dodged the 
question of whether he will run again, saying that he is committed to the new 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to get into the media because I think the mainstream media is part 
of the problem," he said. "I just want to make the show work and shake up the 
system."

TV REVIEWS; POLITICALLY CORRECT KUNG FU IN 'SON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First "On Deadly Ground," and now the TV movie "Vanishing Son" -- it's not 
often that we get two politically correct kung fu features in nearly the same 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vanishing Son" (at 8 tonight on KTLA-TV Channel 5) handily allows you to feel 
bad for the plight of the immigrant, then to cheer as anyone who stands in the 
way of the immigrant gets hurt bad. In the non-martial arts, that's what they 
call a contrived double-whammy. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell Wong (the abusive husband in "The Joy Luck Club") and Chi Muoi Lo star 
as diametrically opposed Chinese brothers -- one's Goofus, the other's Gallant 
-- whose lives take very different paths once they smuggle themselves into 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not so totally different. Both come equipped with fists -- and feet -- 
of fury, and use them to escape being set upon by predators, which, 
fortunately, occurs at about 15-minute intervals. Trapped by Chinese soldiers 
during a Tian An Men Square-type protest, they kick their way out. Cornered 
stateside by jail mates, creditors or gangsters, they kick their way out. 
Disagreeing on employment opportunities -- sensible Wong wants to stay 
straight, while hot-head Lo goes for the gangsta plan -- they kick the hell out 
of each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine Bruce Lee starring in "Combination Platter" and you'll have the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 At least "Vanishing Son" has its heart in the right place, redressing a minor 
historical grievance. After directing "Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story," which 
touched on the fact that the old series "Kung Fu" was originally designed for 
Lee, filmmaker Rob Cohen wanted to create a new show that would actually cast 
Asian Americans as Asians. "Son" is it, with three more installments scheduled 
to follow tonight's two-hour pilot (written and executive produced by Cohen, 
directed by John Nicolella). 
</P>
<P>
 Wong is handsome and limber enough, and Lo has some nice moments in the late 
going, crying over his life-long jealousy. But between the "Fingers"-like 
subplot -- in which Wong instantly gets a gig as a concert violinist (if only 
he can protect his pinkies!) and romances the babe in the adjoining chair, all 
the post-"Godfather" juxtaposed-brothers stuff and token contemporary asides -- 
like the gay character who speaks up only to inform the audience he's a gay 
character -- "Son" doesn't take long to kick up some camp.  
</P>
<P>
 Look on the bright side, fu fans: The fight scenes are fun, and there's no 
David Carradine around to preach pseudo-pacifism. CHRIS WILLMAN

TV REVIEWS; NEW TOM ARNOLD SHOW JUST FILLING TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You have to hand it to Tom and Roseanne Arnold. It's not every couple who has 
the clout to wangle back-to-back forgettable comedies that have the husband's 
name in the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to rebound from the demise of last season's grating "The Jackie Thomas 
Show" on ABC, Tom Arnold returns at 8:30 tonight on Channels 2 and 8 playing a 
kinder, gentler welder who has moved his wife and five kids into a construction 
trailer by the dream home he is building on a farm in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 The series is "Tom." The executive producers/creators/writers are the Arnolds 
and Steve Pepoon. The network is CBS, which reportedly had been wooing the 
Arnolds following "Roseanne" superstar Roseanne's celebrated epic tiffs with 
ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC recently announced a new three-year deal for "Roseanne." But Roseanne 
immediately denied making a new deal with ABC. If you think that's confusing, 
let's look in on the farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Arnold is likable enough as Tom Graham, a stereotypical, 
rough-on-the-edges lug with a heart of gold. He's most appealing when joshing 
with his brother-in-law. Based on its premiere, however, "Tom" reeks of 
ordinariness, being one of those series that is neither bad nor good, filling 
space without either offending or rewarding. It's just . . . there. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little humor or character consistency to sustain the opening half 
hour, which finds Tom ridiculing his wife, Dorothy (Alison LaPlaca), for 
wanting to go to law school. 
</P>
<P>
 Her: "I'm going to be a lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 Him (snickering): "That's super, honey. I'm going to be an astronaut." 
</P>
<P>
 Whereupon she dumps a bowl of food on his head. 
</P>
<P>
 But he has a change of heart later, telling her that she should go to law 
school. But she has a change of heart, telling him that she shouldn't go to law 
school. But he goes to the registrar's office later, making sure she does go to 
law school. Then she agrees she should go to law school. "But wait a minute," 
she adds. "How are we going to pay for this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Huh? She applied to law school, got accepted to law school, responded angrily 
when Tom mocked her plans to attend law school, and only now is wondering how 
they're going to pay for law school? Only a Philadelphia lawyer could decode 
this fine print. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course. That's it. A Philadelphia lawyer played by you-know-who in a third 
Tom Arnold series, "The Tom T. Thomas Show." Watch for the promos. HOWARD

HUNTINGTON BILLED FOR SALARY SPIKING; GOVERNMENT: CITY MUST PAY THE STATE 
RETIREMENT SYSTEM NEARLY $1 MILLION. COUNCILMAN SAYS COST WILL STOP THE 
PRACTICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BARKER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state retirement system has billed Huntington Beach nearly $1 million for 
allowing city retirees to artificially inflate their final-year salaries to 
boost their retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman David Sullivan, a leading critic of the practice known as 
"spiking," announced Tuesday that the city had received the bills from the 
Public Employees' Retirement System following an audit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I estimate that the city has already ripped off the state retirement system 
for at least $2.5 million," Sullivan said. "At least now there will be a price 
tag for spiking. I cannot find words strong enough to express my disgust for 
the salary spiking process." 
</P>
<P>
 Salary spiking became a heated issue in Huntington Beach in January, 1992, 
after state Controller Gray Davis charged that 16 Huntington Beach city 
retirees had inflated their final-year salaries. The controller's office said 
that although spiking wasn't illegal, such practices drain the state's 
retirement system. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis had singled out Huntington Beach and Anaheim as cities where retirees 
improperly counted sick leave, vacation days, car allowances and other perks to 
boost their salaries, from which pension payments are calculated. 
</P>
<P>
 In Anaheim, the retirement packages of two former city managers were listed as 
examples of pension spiking. The most dramatic of those was the case of former 
Anaheim City Manager William O. Talley, whose salary was increased from $97,390 
yearly to $159,109 within the year before he resigned in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim City Manager James D. Ruth said Tuesday that the city has not received 
any recent bills from the state retirement system. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth W. Marzion, a spokesman for the state retirement system, said Tuesday 
that bills totaling $24 million have been mailed to California cities for 
spiking. It was not immediately known which ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan said Huntington Beach received the first bill in November for 
$447,413. He learned Tuesday from City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga that 
the city received another bill Feb. 14 for $471,000, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have been waiting for the city to disclose this $447,000 bill to the 
public," Sullivan said at a news conference. "Since it has been . . . months 
since this bill arrived, I can only assume that the city does not intend to 
disclose this information. It therefore becomes my duty as a councilman to 
inform the public."  
</P>
<P>
 Personnel Director William Osness said the city had been expecting the bills 
following an audit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know when or how much," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's surplus in the Public Employees Retirement System, from state 
overcharges of previous years, covers all but $11,000 of the first bill, 
Sullivan said. But the city will have to pay the second bill from the general 
fund, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan said that city employee unions have had provisions in their contracts 
allowing spiking for a number of years. In previous cases, employees have 
increased retirement pay as much as $11,000 a year, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 About 30% of the employees have agreed to drop the practice in recent contract 
negotiations, but remaining employee groups are trying to retain it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 New state legislation taking effect July 1 will prohibit the computing of 
unused vacation for salary and retirement purposes, he said. Employees will 
still be able to use city retirement contributions if the city and labor 
association agree, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan said he was pleased that the state was charging the cities that allow 
spiking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that people know that there is a price to pay, there won't be anything 
such as spiking," he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees who participate "are taking money out of the retirement fund from 
all other state and city employees who don't spike their salaries, and 
ultimately from the taxpayers who will have to pay the bill," he said.

DANA PARSONS: STRIPPING BARE THE OBJECTIONS TO ADULT ENTERTAINMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Would we have a better world if they shut down every topless nightclub, adult 
bookstore and massage parlor? 
</P>
<P>
 Let's hope we never have to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, I'm kidding! I'm kidding! 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's because I'm a disgusting man with no moral compass, but I cannot 
take up arms in the burgeoning battle over Orange County's adult-entertainment 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, you didn't know there was a battle? 
</P>
<P>
 I haven't seen this level of hostility since my old stomping grounds of Denver 
made national news with a topless doughnut shop. Well, the doughnuts weren't 
topless . . . oh, you know what I mean. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is threatening to turn blue. 
</P>
<P>
 * Newport Beach rejected a permit for what would have been the city's first 
nude-dancing bar. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fountain Valley, after receiving inquiries about nude-dance nightclubs, 
passed a temporary ordinance to keep out adult businesses, even while conceding 
that it can't make the ban permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 * Costa Mesa has refused to issue permits to two existing massage parlors, 
saying they must close down later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some Santa Ana residents are wary that two topless nightclubs will spawn 
imitators in other neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Anaheim lost a couple attempts to thwart topless dancing and a 
police sergeant warned of a possible "groundswell" of such clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The adult entertainment business poses particularly ticklish problems for 
places like Orange County, where the entrepreneurial supply-and-demand business 
ethic butts heads with presumed moral sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Confession time: I have attended performances at both Paddy Murphy's and 
Captain Cream's, two Orange County establishments that feature (are you sitting 
down for this?) topless dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 I know that many protesters are convinced that patrons of such places are life 
forms of the lowest order, but the crowds generally look like the guys who hang 
out at sports bars on Saturday night. Some young guys in T-shirts, some 
businessmen wearing shirts and ties, and a bunch of nondescript palookas in 
between. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh sure, they yell stupid stuff but it's just as often at one of their buddies 
as it is at the dancers. And trust me, they know the dancers consider them all 
goofballs ready to part with their cash. What I'm saying is, clubs like that 
may have great sociological meaning, but it's pretty much lost on everybody 
inside the joint. 
</P>
<P>
 So why does everybody get so uptight? 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley Mayor John Collins says he realizes the city can't ban adult 
businesses. Its best hope is to confine them to particular areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins says he's convinced such places erode the American fabric of family 
and basic values. He likens it to the barrage of TV programs that, he says, 
undermine the traditional mom / dad / daughter / son scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without question, it's not just a majority but a vast majority of citizens of 
this city don't want this type of business in their city, period," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 While he won't disregard any federal or state laws that permit adult 
businesses, Collins says, he is personally opposed to them. "If it (a topless 
club, for example) goes in someplace, I'd be one of the first people down there 
to picket," he says. "I can do that as a private citizen, not as mayor. I 
wouldn't have my mayor's hat on then. I'd put on my Red Sox hat." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked what it is that bugs him. "I guess I wouldn't picket one in Anaheim or 
Garden Grove or Costa Mesa," he says. "I guess I don't feel that strongly about 
it, but I don't want them in my city." 
</P>
<P>
 What is it that people really fear from an adult bookstore? Why would people 
not fear having one of those naughty books in their home and yet cringe at them 
in a store? 
</P>
<P>
 Why isn't Orange County's conservative community crying out, "Wait a minute, 
dirty books don't kill people; people kill people." And, surely we know that 
topless dancers don't kill people. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't the presence of the stuff that offends. And you can't even say with 
complete certainty that it's the kind of people that stuff attracts: remember 
Jimmy Swaggart? He preached to millions over TV and yet he had that thing for 
Penthouse magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 So, is it just the idea we don't like? Do we hate being tempted by stuff like 
that? Would it make our moral choices much simpler if there wasn't a place down 
the street to go to ? Are we protecting ourselves from ourselves? 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry to leave you hanging, but I have no idea what the answer is. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm content knowing that some of history's most entertaining fights have come 
between moralists and whatever you call the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of you will be outraged by the imminent battles over adult entertainment 
in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 I, for one, expect to be amused. 
</P>

FULLERTON POLICE ARREST SUSPECT IN ATM FRAUD RING; CRIME: AUTHORITIES BELIEVE 
HE IS PART OF A NETWORK TARGETING BANK OF AMERICA. THIS IS THE COUNTY'S SECOND 
CARD SCAM ARREST IN A MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Quick thinking by a bank customer who flagged down police after seeing someone 
loitering near an automated teller machine led to the arrest of a man suspected 
of being part of an ATM fraud ring, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Shimon Levi, 29, was arrested without incident Monday night after police found 
him carrying a handgun outside the Bank of America at 1831 W. Orangethorpe 
Ave., said Fullerton Police Lt. Tony Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers who searched Levi's car found more than 200 counterfeit ATM cards, 
$4,200 in $20 bills and a list of bank account numbers, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Levi) had a large map of Orange County laying out 18 other locations of Bank 
of Americas," Hernandez said. "It looked like he was just getting started for 
the evening and had made all of the withdrawals out of the ATM machine at this 
bank." 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe Levi was not working alone, but is part of a ring targeting 
Bank of America customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Levi, a resident of West Hills in the San Fernando Valley, was being held 
Tuesday at the Federal Detention Center in Los Angeles on suspicion of forgery, 
fraudulent use of credit cards and possession of a loaded handgun, Hernandez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said the ring uses receipts left behind at ATMs to obtain customers' 
account numbers and surveillance to obtain their personal identification 
number, or PIN. The ring apparently manufactures phony ATM cards and encodes 
their magnetic strips with filched account numbers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ring will either videotape or use binoculars or telescopes to watch 
people put their (PIN) numbers into the machines," Hernandez said.  
</P>
<P>
 This is the second time in a month that police in Orange County have arrested 
people in connection with an ATM card scam. On Feb. 9, Newport Beach police 
arrested three men and charged them in an ATM fraud scheme that may have netted 
$100,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, police seized 500 automated teller machine cards, magnetic 
strips for altering the cards, a telescope, $20,000 in cash and two firearms. 
The three men are in custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los 
Angeles awaiting arraignment March 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Both cases were turned over by local police to the U.S. Secret Service, which 
investigates the counterfeiting of credit cards, a federal offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal investigators would not comment on the case Tuesday. Local police said 
they did not know if the two Orange County cases are linked or if either is 
connected to a major automated teller ring in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley ring, which has been operating for more than a year, 
is believed to be responsible for stealing at least $100,000 from Bank of 
America customers' accounts, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In that scheme, authorities said the thieves have used high-powered cameras 
hidden in vans, hotel rooms and rented offices to tape customers as they 
entered their PINs. They then pair card numbers with the PINs by noting when 
the transaction took place and matching the time of day printed on the 
discarded ATM receipt to the hour recorded on the videotape, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of America has apparently been a target because, until recently, its 
machines printed the entire account number on receipts. The bank, however, 
ceased the practice in December, the same month it was reported that federal 
agents were investigating the San Fernando Valley ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Other banks such as Wells Fargo and Great Western discontinued printing the 
entire account numbers on ATM receipts as a security measure in mid-1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of America's spokesman Harvey Radin said the discovery of the San 
Fernando Valley ring and the change in procedure at his bank were merely a 
coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an isolated case, and blocking out the numbers was not a result of 
that situation," Radin said. "It's an extra safety measure that adds another 
element of security." 
</P>
<P>
 Radin recommends the following steps to protect yourself from becoming a 
victim of ATM fraud: 
</P>
<P>
 * Be aware of your surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shield the key pad with your hand or your body while entering your code. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not leave your transaction receipt behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you take these relatively simple steps, you can protect yourself so you 
won't be a victim of this type of fraud," Radin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Radin said customers who prove to be legitimate victims of fraud are 
reimbursed for their loss after their complaint is thoroughly investigated. 
Most ATM accounts have withdrawal limits, usually between $200 and $500 a day, 
which restricts the amount of money a thief can take at one time. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of America has more than 3,400 automated teller machines throughout the 
state. Radin said that despite the recent incidents, fraudulent use of these 
machines is still extremely rare, accounting for less than one-tenth of 1% of 
all transactions.

3 ARRESTED IN KILLING OF MOVIE SECURITY GUARD; CRIME: THE SUSPECTS ARE SANTA 
ANA MEN. A POLICE OFFICIAL CALLED THE KILLING OF THE MARINE VET AT HIS THEATER 
JOB 'ONE OF THE MOST SENSELESS KILLINGS I'VE EVER SEEN.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Three Santa Ana men were arrested in connection with the shooting death of an 
unarmed security guard last month in what one police official described Tuesday 
as "probably one of the most senseless killings I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 During a news conference, police identified the suspects as Jerry Lee Alonzo 
Jr., 19, the suspected gunman, and his alleged accomplices, Rafael Maldonado, 
20, and Jessie Pena, 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Police Lt. Timm Browne said that Alonzo, who has no previous criminal 
record, admitted his role in the slaying of Dagoberto R. Carrero, a 23-year-old 
former Marine and veteran of the Persian Gulf War who was on his last day as a 
security guard at Century City Centre Theatre when he was killed Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 All three suspects, who were arrested Monday night, were being held in Orange 
County Jail without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The break in the case came from an anonymous tip, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on what we have so far," Browne said, "this gets down to a kid working 
himself into a rage, going home and getting a gun, and killing someone over 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Browne said that in his 24-year career, "this is probably one of the most 
senseless, heartless killings I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Bowen, Carrero's brother-in-law and a family spokesman, said that Carrero 
was shot "over disrespect, instead of settling out behind the shed with fists 
like you used to." 
</P>
<P>
 "His job was to keep the peace in the theater, and he did a good job of 
keeping the peace," said Bowen, 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this guy goes to the gas chamber. He deserves everything he gets." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe the killing was a result of an incident at the Century 
City Centre Theatre involving Carrero and Alonzo a month before the shooting, 
in which "Alonzo had taken some offense," Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, on Feb. 19, Alonzo apparently watched as Carrero got involved 
in an incident involving six teen-agers who reportedly threatened the security 
guard when he asked them to leave the theater so a crew could clean up after a 
showing of a film at 7:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Alonzo pretended to side with Carrero in the dispute with the teen-agers. He 
then left the theater and went to Santa Ana to get a handgun, Browne said. He 
returned to the theater and shot Carrero, after which he paged the two other 
suspects and asked them to pick him up in the theater parking lot, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun has not been recovered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alonzo told investigators that Carrero "did not pay him respect," according to 
Browne. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, police had been seeking the six teen-agers with whom Carrero had 
argued, but that group was ruled out as suspects after investigators received a 
tip which led to Alonzo and his two friends, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of fear of retribution, the informant has not claimed the $10,000 
reward offered by Patrol One, Carrero's employer, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrero, a native of Puerto Rico, was buried on Saturday at a funeral attended 
by nearly 230 family members, friends and a Marine Corps honor guard, filling 
an Orange mortuary to capacity to say goodby to the former serviceman. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrero, who survived seven months of flying helicopter missions in the 
Persian Gulf, was chosen Marine of the Year in 1991 from among the 250 members 
of his Tustin-based helicopter squadron. Carrero was a junior aerial gunner 
instructor and a crew chief on a four-member CH-53 helicopter team. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen said Carrero worked two eight-hour shifts a day to support his family 
and had planned to attend college. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was his last night working at the theater," Bowen said sadly. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrero had been accepted into the Air National Guard, and was scheduled to 
fly to Texas on Thursday for a four-month training session, which Carrero hoped 
would help pay for college, Bowen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrero is survived by his 27-year-old wife, Nicole, and the couple's 
9-month-old daughter, Jeralyn. The couple had been married for 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen said that his sister was "relieved" to learn of the arrest, but that the 
loss of her husband "hasn't even hit her yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen said that as a Marine, Carrero learned to be prepared for any 
eventuality, so he carried enough life insurance that his wife "is OK for a 
while."  
</P>
<P>
 A Patrol One official said that Nicole Carrero qualifies for the standard 
$115,000 workers' compensation death benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have great admiration for the Orange Police Department for being able to 
get these guys this fast," said Bill Bancroft, the company's owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Honorah Bowen, the 83-year-old grandmother of Nicole Carrero, said the family 
is relieved that the suspects are in custody, but she said that she is 
particularly concerned about her great-granddaughter, who will never get to 
know her father. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what's so sad is that dear little girl who's missing him so much 
already," she said. "What will the rest of her life be like?" 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Bowen praised Orange police for the swift arrests, but he said finding 
out the circumstances of the shooting has added to the family's grief. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes it worse," he said. "To get killed over a token or because you 
dissed somebody, that's ridiculous. It's crazy. But we wanted the case resolved 
and we wanted to know the reason behind the killing."

ABSTINENCE STATEMENT CRITICIZED AS ANTI-GAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Sandra L. Genis has declared this week Abstinence Week in Costa Mesa, an 
official reminder that the only foolproof way to avoid getting AIDS through sex 
is not to have sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Health educators generally welcomed the declaration, but said sexual 
abstinence cannot be encouraged as the only defense against pregnancy and 
disease. They also berated as inflammatory a statement that was issued by 
Abstinence Week organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The red 'AIDS' ribbon is a lie," read a statement distributed by the group. 
"It promotes a lifestyle and education that allows sex with a condom." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement, with a white ribbon pinned to one side, was distributed last 
week at the City Council meeting where the mayor made her declaration. The text 
also attacked the reliability of condoms and added, "the red 'AIDS' ribbon is 
stained with blood, blood that could be infected and kill me." 
</P>
<P>
 Abstinence Week is not a week without sex, but a time for people to reflect on 
the benefits of delaying sexual activity until marriage, according to organizer 
Barbara Whitacre. "We need to give support to our teens who want to be 
abstinent." 
</P>
<P>
 Genis made the declaration, which covers the week that began Sunday, at 
Whitacre's request. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a worthwhile thing to declare," Genis said. "Heaven knows 
it's the only foolproof thing we've got against some of these things." 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa is the only city in the county to declare Abstinence Week. The 
council has traditionally given the mayor authority to make such 
pronouncements. 
</P>
<P>
 But after questions were raised about the organizers' statement, the mayor was 
quick to distance herself from its specifics and noted that it was not part of 
the official declaration. "I didn't write the thing, and I just kind of glanced 
at it," she said. "That is not an official city statement." 
</P>
<P>
 And after learning that some critics considered the statement anti-gay, the 
organizers revised it to eliminate references to the red ribbon, which has 
become an international symbol of the fight against AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers say they hope Abstinence Week will be recognized by other cities as 
well. Whitacre said the idea came to her during a conversation with friends at 
a meeting at Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitacre gave a brief speech in favor of abstinence at the Feb. 22 council 
meeting and passed out the white-ribboned statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's anti-gay," said David Martin, president of the California Assn. 
of AIDS Agencies, a statewide organization that provides assistance to local 
health educators. "I don't view that (red) ribbon as an endorsement of 
activities that would lead to HIV infection." 
</P>
<P>
 After learning of Martin's comments, Clark Emerson, an Orange resident who 
wrote the statement, discarded the roughly 900 flyers he had prepared. "I was 
not trying to offend any individuals," he said. "I was trying to make a point 
about an idea." 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote a new statement focusing on the risks of condoms and the benefits of 
abstinence. To teach a young person to depend on condoms, which no one believes 
are 100% effective at preventing HIV transmission, is wrong and deadly, Emerson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Martin said he wonders why the council endorsed Abstinence Week after 
Whitacre presented such an offensive statement. "I think it speaks to a lack of 
awareness on the part of the mayor and City Council," he said. Several council 
members said they first saw the white ribbons and statements on their chairs 
when the Feb. 22 meeting began. 
</P>
<P>
 Genis acknowledged that she spoke with Whitacre about Abstinence Week several 
days before the meeting, but said she had not carefully read the short 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it is anti-gay," Genis said after reviewing the statement. "If 
people choose to take things personally, then that's their prerogative." 
</P>
<P>
 Council member Mary Hornbuckle, who also did not read the whole statement 
before the meeting began, said she wished the council had talked about it 
beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have found that offensive," she said of the statement, "simply 
because this is a personal decision."  
</P>
<P>
 Hornbuckle said she is concerned about the appearance of a council endorsement 
for the statement. "I suspect it's an area that government doesn't have a lot 
of business in," she said. "It probably should be a decision made by the whole 
council." 
</P>
<P>
 In November, Genis was criticized by local arts officials after she refused to 
issue a written proclamation of A Day Without Art as part of a worldwide 
observance of the toll AIDS has taken. Genis did verbally declare the day, in 
the same way she declared Abstinence Week. She said she reserves written 
proclamations for residents or local organizations deserving of recognition for 
special achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 Several county health educators interviewed by The Times said they approved of 
Abstinence Week, but all emphasized that abstinence should be presented along 
with condom education and other safer-sex lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people are having sex, it's hard to get them to stop," said Jack Herzberg, 
program director for the AIDS Response Program, the oldest AIDS-education 
organization in the county. "I don't think that promoting abstinence as the 
only alternative is reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always present abstinence as an option," Herzberg said. "And for people 
who choose to be sexually active, they need to know how to keep themselves 
safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson, Whitacre and others criticize health educators who talk of abstinence 
and also give a frank discussion of condoms and other birth control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that when you mix the message like that, it discredits the choice 
for abstinence," said Priscilla Hurley, director of Choices/Teen Awareness 
Inc., a non-sectarian Anaheim group that has taught abstinence classes in North 
County school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of them hear that waiting is a good idea, but if you can't wait, use a 
condom," Hurley said of students. "But when I ask them what that communicates, 
90% of them respond that that gives them permission." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurley says her group steers clear of religious messages when it teaches young 
people how to maintain abstinence. Whitacre said Abstinence Week also has no 
religious agenda. "To me it's not a religious issue; it's a health issue," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more of the programs are looking at the benefits of delaying sexual 
activity," Penny Weismuller, county manger for disease control, said. But she 
stressed that "abstinence is a part of a total message that recognizes what's 
going on with young people. You don't just present either side of the message."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; SALE OF A DISTRICT CEMETERY APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Board of Supervisors Tuesday approved the sale of the 
120-year-old Magnolia Memorial Park Cemetery in Garden Grove to a private 
company for $31,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-acre cemetery, which belonged to the Orange County Cemetery District, 
was sold to the Omega Society Inc. of Santa Ana. District officials say the 
transaction was likely the first sale of a public cemetery in California 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees of the cemetery district recommended selling the parcel to help 
offset state revenue losses that are expected to total $700,000 by the end of 
the year. The losses have forced the agency to reduce its staff and contract 
work for landscaping and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think it was in the best interest of everyone involved," said 
district General Manager Sam Randall. "It was a prudent decision for the board 
of trustees and showed real foresight and concern by the board to concur with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Several county residents with relatives buried in the cemetery spoke at a 
public hearing before the board's 4-0 vote and expressed concern that a new 
owner might not maintain the cemetery grounds as well as the district has. 
</P>
<P>
 An Omega representative told the board and the speakers that the terms of the 
sale required that the company keep the cemetery up to district standards.  
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said the sale made good business sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Change doesn't come easily . . . (but) this will reduce the size and expense 
of government," she said. "The direction of the future is privatization." 
</P>
<P>
 Randall agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Privatization is a sensitive issue and if it happens to be a cemetery it can 
be even more sensitive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia Cemetery, with 3,800 plots, is the smallest of the districts four 
cemeteries. There is room at the cemetery for about 1,000 additional plots. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action Tuesday, the board agreed to spend $255,000 to extend for six 
months a program that resulted in removal of 237,000 square feet of graffiti 
since July. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members contributed $255,000 to start the graffiti abatement program 
last year and decided to fund it for another six months after reviewing the 
program's initial success. 
</P>
<P>
 Last July, the county had 327,000 square feet of graffiti to be removed, 
county officials said. The graffiti is now down to 90,000 square feet, and all 
of it should be gone by the end of the month, the board was told by officials 
from the county's Environmental Management Agency.MATT LAIT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; CAL STATE GROUP BACKS GRAPE BOYCOTT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Student leaders at Cal State Fullerton pledged Tuesday to ban California table 
grapes on campus in support of the United Farm Workers, who are pressing for 
stronger protections against pesticides and better working conditions for 
migrant farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the university's Associated Students board of directors voted to 
prohibit grapes at any event they sponsor and to encourage all other university 
groups to honor the UFW boycott. 
</P>
<P>
 A resolution adopted by Associated Students on Tuesday supports the UFW's 
efforts to educate farm workers about the dangers of "8 million pounds of 
unnecessary toxic pesticides used (on) table grapes each year." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to recognize the plight of the UFW, " said Associated Students 
President Christopher Lowe, 23. "A number of student organizations on campus 
have made this issue extremely important, and the (Associated Students) is 
happy to be joining" other colleges and universities to support the grape 
boycott. 
</P>
<P>
 One Associated Students board member, however, opposed the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel that the (Associated Students) has the right to take away the 
choice of what other students put in their own bodies," said David Lamm, who 
represents the School of Communications on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Russ Jobin, a UFW volunteer organizer, said Cal State Fullerton's support is 
encouraging, and helps place attention on the union's grape boycott as the 
anniversary of UFW founder Cesar Chavez' death approaches. Chavez died in his 
sleep of natural causes in April, 1993, while visiting Yuma, Ariz.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a resurrection of support for the boycott since Cesar died," 
Jobin said. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; TEST SCORES TOP STATE, NATIONAL 
AVERAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students at all grade levels in the Capistrano Unified School District scored 
well above state and national averages on a variety of assessment tests last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials told trustees Monday they believe the results validate the 
work of teachers and administrators from kindergarten through high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where all student scores are factored in, we are enjoying continued 
improvement and a positive growth curve," said Assistant Supt. Barbara F. 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests included aptitude and achievement tests for college placement to 
standardized tests measuring elementary school pupils' progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am extremely proud of what is happening in our school district," Trustee 
Annette B. Gude said. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said they were especially pleased with results from the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test, the entrance exam used by hundreds of state and 
private universities and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a greater percentage of seniors took the SAT in 1993 than in 1992, 
which often will drive down the districtwide results, the average verbal score 
increased 10 points and the average math score went up 9 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, 46% of Capistrano Unified's seniors took the SAT, compared to 44% in 
1992. The average 1993 verbal score was 457 and the average math score was 528. 
The combined score of 985 placed the district 44 points above the state average 
and 50 points above the national average. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Levens, coordinator of secondary instructional support, noted that 
students who reported themselves in the top 10% of their graduating class did 
exceptionally well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their scores are absolutely phenomenal when you compare them to the state and 
national data," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The average combined verbal and math score for the top students was 1193, 107 
points higher than their state counterparts and 94 points above the national 
mean. Their performance also showed a 20-point increase from 1992 and a leap of 
60 points from five years before. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors performed similarly on Advanced Placement tests, college board 
achievement tests and the American College Testing Program tests. The composite 
ACT score in 1993 dropped to 23.3 from 23.6 in 1992 because of declines in math 
and reading, but stayed ahead of the state and national scores of 21.3 and 
20.7, respectively. Twenty-five more students, 269, took the test in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 High school and middle school students also placed above average in the Golden 
State Examinations administered by the California Department of Education. The 
exams tested students' abilities in first-year algebra, geometry, U.S. history, 
economics, biology and chemistry. Whereas 37% of students statewide received 
special recognition for strong performance on the tests, 58% of Capistrano 
Unified students achieved the honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in the California Achievement Test that measures basic skills of 
young pupils, 95% of the district's elementary schools recorded averages at or 
above grade level. RICHARD CORE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; 2 DOGS BOUGHT FOR POLICE CANINE UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Police Department has purchased two police dogs for more than $15,000 to 
replace Dingo, a veteran dog who died in January, and Hondo, a second police 
dog that is near retirement age. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly purchased dogs were imported from Europe three weeks ago and sent to 
a monthlong training session in Riverside, said Newport Beach Lt. Paul Henisey. 
</P>
<P>
 The money for the new German shepherd dogs came from public donations 
following Dingo's death from complications after surgery. And the police 
department is preparing to retire Hondo in coming months, leaving it with one 
dog. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the expenditure Monday night when it approved its 
consent calendar, a list of routine items voted on as a group. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things we have found is that the dogs are very effective tools," 
said Newport Beach Lt. Paul Henisey. "So because of that, and . . . the amount 
of community support for the canine program," they decided to bring the canine 
units back up to three. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials say the newly acquired dogs being trained in commands, 
operations and search techniques will begin work in April. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the new police dogs is from Germany, the other from Czechoslovakia. 
And, for example, the dog born and raised in Germany learned commands from 
German handlers. Once it reaches Newport Beach, the canine officers will learn 
German to communicate with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the public donations left over have been put into a special account to 
be used to pay for training the dogs in narcotics sniffing.BOB ELSTONPOLICE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; TRI-CITIES TO DISCUSS MARINES' WATER DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tri-Cities Water District will outline the benefits of a recently forged deal 
to buy water from the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton during tonight's City 
Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-minute presentation will detail the district's purchase of water in the 
San Mateo Basin, an approximately $5-million transaction that water officials 
say would provide a badly needed source of emergency water. 
</P>
<P>
 However, critics of the purchase say the water district, whose main customer 
is San Clemente, may be spending too much. San Clemente water users, who make 
up about 70% of the district's customers, may ultimately pay for the water 
purchase in the form of higher rates, say city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement was approved by the water board last week, despite the urging of 
Mayor Scott Diehl to move more slowly on the project. However, the council is 
not likely to take action on the issue on Wednesday, Diehl said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal with the Marine Corps comes at a time when the county is considering 
merging the Tri-Cities district with other water agencies. It would be the 
first time the Marines have allowed a civilian government to tap the vast pools 
of underground water at the base. FRANK MESSINA

<P>
 The pros and cons of converting the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station into a 
commercial airport will be discussed March 9 at a community forum sponsored by 
the Irvine Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach Mayor Clarence J. Turner will speak in favor of turning El Toro 
into an air cargo facility when the Pentagon closes the base at the end of the 
decade.Retired Col. Leonard Fuchs will speak against the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber of Commerce officials said the event is designed to present residents 
with both sides of the airport debate. A previous chamber-sponsored forum 
focused on how the base conversion process works. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine and several other South County cities oppose converting El Toro into an 
airport, fearing the move would cause noise, traffic and pollution problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Newport Beach, Garden Grove, Anaheim and several other cities 
support the airport concept because they said it will give the local economy a 
needed boost. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum will take place at the Irvine Civic Center from 7 to 9 p.m. The 
public is welcome to attend. The event will also be televised live on Dimension 
Cable Channel 3. 
</P>
<P>
 After Turner and Fuchs make their presentations, a panel of local experts will 
field questions from the audience.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; FIFTH-GRADERS LEARN TO BRING STORY TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once upon a time there was a shy little girl named Thao Nguyen who feared 
public speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Thao, 10, of Westminster, got nervous at being the center of attention and 
preferred to stay clear of the limelight. Then, one day, her fairy godteacher 
at Carrillo Elementary School showed Thao's fifth-grade class how to act out 
vivid tales with wild arm motions and different voices. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past few months, the teacher's magic transformed Thao and her 
classmates into master storytellers, capable of enthralling large audiences 
with words and gestures. So, on Friday, Thao stepped confidently in front of 
almost 100 of her peers and wove her tale of a village trickster who got what 
he deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, it was kind of scary, but now it's really enjoyable" to act out a 
story for a group, she said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Her teacher, Traci Hoff, started using storytelling as a instructional device 
earlier this school year and said that it has paid off for her students both 
inside and out of the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's improved their writing, reading, poise and self-confidence. They tell me 
they would never have been able to (perform alone) before. But now, they do and 
they're very proud of themselves," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, her students perform for the younger children on campus on a regular 
basis and coach each other on ways to improve their performances. Some of the 
tricks the performers have learned include using sound effects, arm movements 
and descriptive words to evoke mental images and involve listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important part is doing the voices. You do a deep voice for big, 
mean people and a high squeaky voice for little animals and people," said Lisa 
Co, 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Learning to tell a story well has already helped her in other subjects in 
school. In fact, she attributes improvement in her grades in writing -- from Bs 
to A's -- to her involvement in telling stories: "If you learn how to 
story-tell, your writing is more descriptive and exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the students at Carrillo will perform at a storytelling festival 
sponsored by the County Department of Education on Saturday. The festival, held 
at the Department of Education, 200 Kalmus Drive, Costa Mesa, will run from 9 
a.m. to noon. About 100 children from all over the county will participate in 
the event. Admission is free, spokeswoman Julie Chan said. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Friday, 34 students from Carrillo practiced their skills, telling tales 
of wicked princesses, helpful elves, forest giants and hungry hippopotamuses to 
a rapt crowd of youngsters who smiled and giggled during the assembly. The 
performers waved their arms, knocked on imaginary doors and portrayed numerous 
characters often with breathless delight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they were good. They were exciting," said Lindsey Ellis, 10, after 
the show. "The way they described it, it really made you visualize a picture in 
your head." 
</P>
<P>
 For Thao, whose shyness has been replaced with self-confidence, storytelling 
had become a wonderful habit. 
</P>
<P>
 'It makes you feel really good inside. It's a feeling that you're sharing 
something special," she told the young man who came to watch her perform. 
</P>
<P>
 It was clear to everyone that sharing stories had helped Thao grow into a 
better, smarter person; and that when she shared her gift with others, she 
received many gifts in return. 
</P>
<P>
 The End. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTY'S BASE REUSE PLAN CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By E. J. GONG JR.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors decided Tuesday to seek federal permission for 
an animal shelter, an alcohol detention facility and a juvenile hall on the 
Tustin Marine Corps Air Station, despite opposition from Tustin officials who 
say those uses are not compatible with the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We disagree with the county. We think those plans will not work, and don't 
fit into our overall reuse plan," Tustin City Manager William A. Huston said. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have met with Tustin leaders for the past two weeks, but 
remain far apart on several issues involving the future of the 1,600-acre base, 
which will be converted to civilian use after 1997.  
</P>
<P>
 "How is a sobering-up facility going to be appropriate and compatible with 
educational facilities and private development like a housing complex on the 
base?" Huston said. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials maintain that the Tustin base closure presents an opportunity 
to build "high-priority" facilities which the county badly needs.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have an obligation to provide these services to the public and here's an 
opportunity to potentially receive land and buildings free. It's an opportunity 
we just can't let go by without trying to capitalize on it," said Ernie 
Schneider, county administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
 According to federal law, land and buildings at closed military bases can be 
given or sold at below-market prices to local governments as long as the 
federal government approves of their future uses. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted unanimously Tuesday to submit applications to various federal 
departments for the animal shelter, an alcohol detention center and a juvenile 
hall. Meanwhile, the city of Tustin will submit its own reuse plan. The 
Department of the Navy will eventually decide how the base will be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider said that moving the animal shelter from Orange would free up land 
for expansion at the Theo Lacy Branch Jail. He also said a second juvenile hall 
is needed to relieve the overcrowded facility in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin and county officials have agreed on certain uses for the base that 
include an 80-acre urban park, a child-care shelter, a regional law enforcement 
training facility, a family resource center and a jail for inmates on daytime 
work furloughs. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have about a month to submit the applications to the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 City manager Huston is optimistic the government will eventually decide to 
follow the city's reuse plan and reject the county's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congress didn't close down the base to make it a grab bag for county 
agencies," he said. E. J. GONG JR.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; ACTIVIST, CLUB OWNER PLAN RUN FOR COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blues guitarist and city restaurateur Randell Young formally declared his 
candidacy for Santa Ana mayor at his jazz club Tuesday, prompting plumbing 
contractor and community activist John Raya to announce his own plans to run. 
</P>
<P>
 The statements are an early starting gun for what promises to be an active 
political season in Santa Ana, where the mayoral seat and three council seats 
are up for grabs in November. 
</P>
<P>
 But before Young can run, he must overcome one hurdle: The San Clemente 
resident has to move to Santa Ana and register to vote here. That technicality 
has provided early fodder for Raya. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politicians have moved, historically, to get into races. I think ultimately 
the voters decide whether they like that or not," Raya said. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, 39, said he spends all but his sleeping hours in the city and is 
committed to its future. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were a poor person in Santa Ana, and somebody was willing to move from a 
very nice neighborhood in San Clemente -- somebody who already has two 
businesses in Santa Ana and wants to improve the business community and make it 
easier for me to find a job -- I would appreciate that," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said he is looking for a slate of three council hopefuls willing to work 
with him to promote businesses. "I'm really not interested in just being mayor 
and not furthering this agenda. One of the objectives I have to accomplish is 
to recruit three people to run with me who will take on these council-people in 
their districts." 
</P>
<P>
 Young owns a small record company and the namesake Randell's, a jazz and 
supper club on Hutton Centre Drive, and manages commercial property in Santa 
Ana and Santa Monica.  
</P>
<P>
 Raya, 40, said he will officially announce his candidacy within the next week. 
</P>
<P>
 While Raya said he also is eager to improve the climate for business, he said 
more must be done to ensure that the city's youth are prepared to fill the jobs 
created by business. 
</P>
<P>
 Raya has served on the Rancho Santiago College Board of Trustees and lost a 
bid for reelection. He has also served on the city's redevelopment and housing 
advisory commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates can obtain papers after July 18 and must file them with the city by 
Aug. 12. Young must move to the city before picking up the paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Daniel H. Young will not seek reelection. Councilman Robert L. 
Richardson has not said whether he will seek a second term. Councilwoman 
Patricia A. McGuigan has declared in her campaign committee statement that she 
will run; and Mayor Pro Tem Miguel A. Pulido Jr.'s seat will be open, as he has 
served two full terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido is keeping his intentions under wraps. LEE ROMNEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; DISTRICT OFFICIALS' HEARINGS BEGIN TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hearings to determine the professional futures of three top administrators 
with the Orange Unified School District accused of sexual harassment begin 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 10 more hearings have been scheduled this month, the outcome of which 
will determine whether one administrator will be fired and two others 
demoted.Because the three chose to have closed hearings, the public may not 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Supt. Richard L. Donoghue, Chief Fiscal Officer Joyce Capelle and 
Howard Mason, director of maintenance operations and transportation, face 
disciplinary actions following a monthlong investigation into sexual harassment 
in the school district conducted in the fall. Based on the findings of the 
investigation, the school board voted to initiate steps to fire Donoghue and 
demote Capelle and Mason. 
</P>
<P>
 Donoghue, 48, is accused of inappropriate touching of employees, distributing 
lewd materials and using sexually offensive language in the workplace.  
</P>
<P>
 Mason, 45, and Capelle, 39, are accused of immoral conduct, intimidation and 
creation of a hostile work environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Donoghue has not returned to work, being placed on "home assignment" in late 
November. Officials will not say whether he is still being paid.  
</P>
<P>
 The three have denied the allegations and have filed a $60-million lawsuit 
against the district, its attorneys, interim Supt. Marilyn Corey and two 
unnamed board members. The suit alleges, among other things, defamation, 
invasion of privacy and breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the hearings regard a personnel matter, officials and attorneys 
associated with the case would not provide further details. MARTIN MILLER

PLASTIC MEDI-CAL ID CARDS INTRODUCED LOCALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's Medi-Cal patients Tuesday began using the state's new plastic 
ID cards that allow doctors and other medical providers to check eligibility, 
eliminate fraud and speed reimbursements. 
</P>
<P>
 The new California Benefits Identification Cards eliminate the bother of 
answering questions about eligibility and waiting for paper cards, which were 
reissued each month, said Linda Monroe, a spokeswoman with Orange County's 
social services agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The cards use a magnetic strip encoded with a patient's medical coverage 
information. Doctors will run the new cards through a machine to link them with 
computer information in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe said they also will give quick verification of the patient's 
eligibility and whether a co-payment is required. 
</P>
<P>
 "They use them just like your ATM machine," Monroe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, clients receive new Medi-Cal paper cards each month with stickers 
showing the services for which they are eligible, Monroe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stickers are peeled off and sent with the billing to Sacramento. If the 
stickers run out before the end of the month, the patient must ask the county 
for more. Monroe said the new card eliminates such problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, people who have received the cards include 230,000 Medi-Cal 
recipients and another 42,000 senior citizens and blind or disabled residents 
who receive benefits under the federal Supplemental Security Income program. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents eligible for Medi-Cal include adults ages 21 to 64 who do not have 
dependent children and are not blind and disabled. They must meet an income 
requirement that, for a family of four, cannot exceed $1,100 a month, or they 
will have to pay a portion for health insurance coverage, Monroe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beside Orange County, four other California counties have received the new 
cards -- Santa Clara, Napa, Yuba and Butte. 
</P>
<P>
 The state expects to issue 5 million Medi-Cal cards in California by June, 
said a state Department of Health Services spokesman.

 STATE SEEKS REVERSAL OF GIONIS RULING; COURTS: ATTORNEY GENERAL CHALLENGES 
SUCCESSFUL APPEAL THAT ALLEGED A VIOLATION OF CONFIDENTIALITY AND PROSECUTORIAL 
MISCONDUCT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN WEIKEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state attorney general will ask the California Supreme Court to throw out 
an appeals court decision that reversed the convictions of Thomas A. Gionis, a 
wealthy doctor found guilty in 1992 of orchestrating an assault on the daughter 
of actor John Wayne during a bitter child custody fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. Rhonda Cartwright-Ladendorf said Tuesday she will challenge 
a Feb. 18 decision by the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana to overturn 
Gionis' four felony convictions that resulted in a five-year prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 Gionis, an orthopedic surgeon and the estranged husband of Aissa Wayne, had 
been found guilty of hiring two henchmen to attack Wayne and her boyfriend, 
Roger Luby, outside Luby's Newport Beach estate on Oct. 3, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 In the assault, Wayne's limbs were bound and she was thrown face first onto a 
garage floor, cutting her head. Luby was pistol-whipped, then his attackers 
slashed his Achilles' tendons. 
</P>
<P>
 A panel of three justices unanimously held that Orange County Superior Court 
Judge Theodore E. Millard improperly allowed incriminating testimony from a 
family law attorney who had once represented Gionis, in violation of the 
attorney-client privilege. All discussions between lawyer and client are 
supposed to remain confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 They also concluded that the case should be reversed because of improper final 
arguments by the prosecutor, former Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeoffrey L. Robinson. 
The opinion cited Robinson for his "vitriolic rebuttal and personal attacks" on 
Gionis' flamboyant attorney, Bruce Cutler, who is known for his defense of New 
York mobster John Gotti. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the decision is legally incorrect," said Cartwright-Ladendorf, who 
handles appeals for the criminal division of the attorney general's office. "I 
think the attorney should have been allowed to testify, and Mr. Robinson's 
statements do not constitute misconduct at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Cartwright-Ladendorf declined to elaborate further because she has not fully 
prepared her arguments. She has until March 28 to file her appeal with the 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 On the witness stand, lawyer John Lueck, whom Gionis had tried to hire and who 
represented him for one court appearance, testified that Gionis had made some 
threatening remarks about Wayne in his presence about 1 1/2 years before the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's final arguments quoted Shakespeare, Charles Dickens and Danish 
proverbs to repeatedly make the point before the jury that it is an attorney's 
"duty to lie, conceal, distort and slander everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney William Kopeny, who is now representing Gionis, said Tuesday that it 
is common for the losing party at the appeals court level to ask the Supreme 
Court to overturn the ruling. But he added, "It is very rare for the court to 
take the case, particularly when the court of appeals decision is not 
published. I am very hopeful the Supreme Court will not intervene." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty. John D. Conley, who supervises felony prosecutions, said 
"a joint decision" was made by the district attorney's office and state 
attorney general to challenge the 4th District Court of Appeal's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 When the decision was announced, Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi called the 
justices "Monday morning quarterbacks" and defended his office against the 
appeals court, which questioned whether Robinson's "habits may expose a need 
for additional training of trial deputies."

COUNTY WILL GET A FIREFIGHTING HELICOPTER; PUBLIC SAFETY: BOARD FOLLOWS ADVICE 
IN REPORT ON OCTOBER WILDFIRES, AGREES TO SPEND UP TO $1.25 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acting on recommendations of the county's top fire official, the Board of 
Supervisors agreed Tuesday to spend up to $1.25 million on a short-term service 
contract for a firefighting helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials plan to have the helicopter available to Orange County by May, 
which is the start of the next fire season. The board approved the measure 4 to 
0, with Supervisor Thomas F. Riley absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry J. Holms, director of fire services, said the request for a short-term 
helicopter contract will immediately enhance the department's firefighting 
capabilities and give fire officials time to explore financially feasible ways 
of maintaining long-term helicopter service. 
</P>
<P>
 The short-term helicopter contract, which will cover 12 to 18 months, will be 
funded by existing savings within the County Fire Department budget. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 50-page report to the board entitled "Firestorms 1993," Holms said that 
helicopters capable of dumping large quantities of water could have had a 
dramatic effect on efforts to halt the spread of the Laguna Beach fire. That 
fire destroyed or damaged 441 homes at a cost of $528 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Helicopters, once deemed a luxury, are now necessary, critical components in 
emergency response capability," according to the report, which recommends that 
the county acquire or have access to two helicopters.  
</P>
<P>
 The county has traditionally relied on other agencies to provide helicopter 
service. But the devastating firestorms in Laguna Beach, Anaheim Hills and off 
the Ortega Highway showed that too much damage can occur while the county waits 
for helicopter assistance from another agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Firefighting helicopters, the one type of equipment that could have had a 
positive impact during the critical early stages of the recent fires, were 
initially unavailable," the Fire Department's report states. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the options fire officials are investigating for long-term helicopter 
service are buying new helicopters, refurbishing surplus military helicopters 
and renting or leasing helicopters from private companies. 
</P>
<P>
 County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said the California Department 
of Forestry also has offered to give a helicopter to the county, but it would 
cost about $250,000 to refurbish that aircraft. Even then, Schneider said, the 
chopper might not meet the county's firefighting needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are issues the Fire Department needs to analyze," Schneider said. Fire 
officials are expected to return to the board with helicopter recommendations 
in about six months. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the helicopters, Holms' report on the recent fires also 
recommends that the county buy portable pumps for firetrucks and improve its 
communication system. 
</P>
<P>
 "The response to disasters like fires and floods begins long before the first 
alarm is heard or the first rainfall," Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said. "I 
don't think it can be emphasized enough that we have to get going for emergency 
preparedness in every department long before anything actually occurs."

PANEL OKS $8.8 MILLION MORE FOR TOLLWAY; TRANSPORTATION: CONTRACTOR, HINDERED 
BY COURT DELAYS, WOULD USE MONEY TO ASSURE OPENING ON SCHEDULE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Court-ordered construction delays on the San Joaquin Hills tollway would 
result in paying another $8.8 million to the prime contractor under a proposed 
agreement intended to have the tollway open as scheduled in January, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra money will come from a $100-million emergency fund created when the 
San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency last year borrowed $1.2 
billion from investors to pay for the road. The borrowing in the form of bonds 
will be repaid by future toll revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract amendment was approved Tuesday by a committee of the San Joaquin 
Hills Transportation Corridor Agency board of directors, with a vote by the 
full board in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Added to $11 million in previous design changes, the proposed amendment would 
bring total construction costs about $20 million above the original 
construction contract of $743 million. With other, non-construction costs taken 
into account, the total project is expected to cost $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Already partly under construction, the 15-mile, publicly owned toll road would 
connect the Corona del Mar Freeway with Interstate 5 near San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime contractor, Kiewit Pacific, had sought $34 million to prevent 
postponement of opening day due to an injunction issued by a federal judge last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Issued at the request of environmentalists long opposed to the tollway, the 
injunction allows construction at both ends of the 15-mile corridor, but not 
near Laguna Canyon and adjacent greenbelt areas in mid-route. Because the 
injunction changes the original work plan, Kiewit said it would need an 
accelerated work schedule to finish the project on time. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Linda A. McLaughlin is expected to soon hold a final 
hearing on whether to lift the injunction or make it permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 A ruling against the tollway agency would force tollway officials to prepare 
new environmental reviews, possibly delaying the project six months to a year 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach Councilman Phil Sansone, a tollway committee board member, said 
he is alarmed by the original $34-million bill for court delays submitted by 
Kiewit Pacific. The fact that it was reduced substantially, he said, shows that 
such bills "ought to be closely scrutinized." 
</P>
<P>
 Tollway executive Greg Henk explained, however, that Kiewit Pacific helped 
greatly by finding more efficient ways to keep the project going despite the 
court's preliminary injunction. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate development, Corona del Mar residents continued their campaign 
to have proposed toll booths eliminated from Newport Coast Drive, which is 
scheduled to become part of the toll road. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to the tollway board's operations and finance committees, tollway 
Finance Chief Wally Kreutzen said it would take an endowment of $69 million to 
generate interest income equal to toll revenue that would be lost if the booths 
aren't installed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tollway officials said they have no idea where to get the $69 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Sansone, the Newport Beach councilman, has been pressing the agency to remove 
the booths on behalf of Corona del Mar constituents who argue that tolls will 
divert traffic to toll-free Coast Highway as an alternative route, thus 
increasing congestion there. 
</P>
<P>
 California Atty. Gen. Daniel E. Lungren's staff recently decided to issue an 
opinion on the legality of adding Newport Coast Drive to the tollway. 
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) and Corona del Mar homeowners have 
persuaded Lungren to examine several issues, including whether the county had 
legal authority to turn a publicly owned toll-free road over to the tollway 
agency, and whether there was adequate public notice of the action. 
</P>
<P>
 If they can't kill the tolls on Newport Coast Drive, residents have asked the 
county to provide a second free bypass.  
</P>
<P>
 One alternative, which would involve a Z-shaped extension of several surface 
streets, is a "non-parallel route" and is "not adequate," Yvonne Houssels, 
president of the Harbor View Hills Homeowners Assn., told the tollway 
operations committee Tuesday.

 However, a friend of Susan White said Tuesday night that White, foster mother 
of the child, Taj Jayyusi, had received custody and that they were staying at 
an undisclosed location. 
</P>
<P>
 A smiling White left the courtroom after the hearing and rushed to hug 
supporters who had waited for her since the session began at 1:30 p.m. and went 
until late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 White, her attorney and county officials declined to discuss the case, citing 
the gag order issued by Juvenile Court Referee Gary L. Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
 White's lawyer, Redmond P. McAneny, would say only: "I do not intend to be 
back in that courtroom." Tuesday's session ended a closed-door hearing that 
began last week. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend then drove White next door to the Orangewood Children's Home, a 
shelter for abused or neglected children where Taj has been living since Feb. 
18. 
</P>
<P>
 Taj's biological parents, Yaser and Deborah Ann Jayyusi, allegedly abducted 
the child from White's Rancho Santa Margarita home Feb. 12, police have said. 
The couple were arrested in Cerritos Feb. 18 as Yaser Jayyusi tried to pick up 
his paycheck. The boy was with them at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Taj and a 2-year-old sister entered foster care two years ago after being 
taken from the Jayyusis because of allegations of physical abuse, according to 
county Department of Social Services officials and court records. 
</P>
<P>
 White, a special education teacher, had begun proceedings to adopt the boy 
when his parents allegedly snatched him as he played in her garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Both parents are now being held at the County Jail on suspicion of child 
abduction.

O.C. MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO WEAPONS CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Costa Mesa man has pleaded guilty to possessing a sawed-off shotgun and 
faces up to 10 years in prison, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Josh D. Lee, 23, who was arrested last July by federal agents who were 
investigating an alleged plot by skinheads in Orange and Los Angeles counties, 
entered the plea Friday in Federal District Court. He was scheduled to begin 
trial Tuesday on the federal weapons charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say that although Lee was arrested during the skinhead 
investigation, there is no evidence that he was a white supremacist or harbored 
racist views. At his sentencing, which is scheduled for June 13, Lee faces a 
10-year prison term, three years' supervised probation and a $250,000 fine.

DRIVER RUNS, FIRES SHOTS AT END OF 4-FREEWAY POLICE PURSUIT; CRIME: THE SUSPECT 
CALMLY SPOKE TO OFFICERS ON A CAR PHONE DURING THE CHASE, WHICH REACHED SPEEDS 
OF 80 M.P.H. 
</P>

<P>
 A man who chatted on a cellular phone with police Tuesday as he led them on a 
high-speed chase over four freeways later jumped from the moving Mercedes, 
broke into a home and fired at officers as two stunned residents watched. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, who were not hit, used pepper spray and tackled the man, identified as 
Devon Michael Loren, 26. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase began about 2 p.m. at Tustin Acura, after the sales staff notified 
police that a man and woman were trying to buy a Cadillac using stolen drivers' 
licenses and other stolen documents, Tustin Lt. Houston Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 When officers arrived, Loren fled alone in the 1992 Mercedes-Benz 190 the 
couple had arrived in, police said. He got on the Riverside Freeway with up to 
12 police vehicles in close pursuit. Swerving through traffic as he drove 80 
m.p.h. on the Riverside, Orange, Costa Mesa and Santa Ana freeways, Loren 
casually talked on a car phone with a police officer, his elbow out the window 
and drank a soda, officers and witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was talking to our officer back at the Acura dealership," Williams said. 
"Our officer said he should pull over and surrender and nothing would happen to 
him. He told our officer he needed to have a smoke and think about it and then 
hung up." 
</P>
<P>
 Loren got off the freeway in Anaheim and continued to drive at 80 m.p.h., 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where we really got concerned," Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Mercedes struck a Highway Patrol car at State College Boulevard and La 
Palma Avenue, but continued on. 
</P>
<P>
 When Loren reached the corner of Philadelphia Street and Mills Drive, he 
jumped from the car while it was still moving and ran into a house, past two 
residents inside, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Loren "reached into a black bag he was carrying and refused to remove his hand 
while fighting with officers," Anaheim Sgt. Steve Rodig said, "then fired two 
shots from a handgun and was subdued." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the driverless Mercedes jumped a curb and traveled 200 yards south 
down the sidewalk on Philadelphia before it crashed into a chain link fence. 
</P>
<P>
 One eyewitness, who would not give his name, said he looked out his window 
when he heard tires screeching and saw the car chugging down the sidewalk.  
</P>
<P>
 "I threw my shoes on and ran out the door, because I knew there were some kids 
playing up the street and I wanted to stop the car before it got to them," the 
witness said. "But before I caught up with it, it crashed into the fence. It's 
amazing that nobody was around and got hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Loren, whose hometown was not known, was booked on suspicion of attempted 
murder of a police officer and was being held Tuesday in the Anaheim City Jail 
in lieu on $250,000 bail. His companion, Anita Beverly, 39, of Laguna Hills, 
was booked on suspicion of burglary, attempted grand theft and fraudulent 
application and was being held by Tustin police. Loren initially identified 
himself as Quincy Jones III, 23, of Los Angeles.

 To kick off national Women's History Month, UC Irvine on Tuesday launched the 
campus's first WomenFest, a three-day celebration of cultural performances, art 
shows and speakers, highlighting the struggles and accomplishments of women. 
</P>
<P>
 For UCI, WomenFest '94 is especially appropriate, festival planners said, 
given that its new chancellor, Laurel Wilkening, is the first woman at UCI to 
hold that title. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening opened the noon ceremony, praising the efforts of the students and 
faculty who worked to launch the festival and lauding the perseverance of women 
who made the historic month a national recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "With our new chancellor on board, this was the best of all years to have this 
celebration," said Wendy Sayers, who chaired the planning committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Goldsmid, another festival organizer and director of UCI's Women's 
Resource Center, said WomenFest '94 seeks to recognize "the issues among women 
and between women." 
</P>
<P>
 "Women have different interests, issues and priorities among one another, and 
we want to emphasize those differences as well," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other activities include cultural performances, an arts and crafts fair and 
various exhibits on campus. Also, a video festival today and Thursday focuses 
on the different cultures of contemporary literary women. The show includes 
30-minute videos featuring Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Toni Morrison and 
emerging roles of Asian women and Latinas. 
</P>
<P>
 Today at 2 p.m., a panel of students will discuss "beauty" across ethnic and 
cultural lines. At 5:30 p.m., Irvine psychologist Dr. Valerie Gold-Neil will 
present "HIV: Women's Voices," a presentation she created, directed and 
produced. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, a panel of women will debate the usage and connotation of 
"feminist." The scheduled panelists are Betty Hanna-Witherspoon, pastor of 
Turner AME Church in Culver City; Jane Newman, associate professor at UCI; 
Chanzo Nettles-Taalamu, who chairs Senut Sisterhood Society in Los Angeles; and 
Lisa Marquise-McClanahan, coordinator of the Bayview Chapter of National 
Organization for Women. WomenFest '94

GOV. WILSON PUTS $50,000 REWARDS ON POLICE KILLINGS; CRIME: SLAIN OFFICERS ARE 
FROM GARDEN GROVE AND MANHATTAN BEACH. GOVERNOR CALLS DEATHS 'AN ATTACK ON ALL 
OF US.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Declaring that an attack on a police officer is "an attack on all of us," Gov. 
Pete Wilson announced Tuesday $50,000 rewards for information leading to the 
arrest and conviction of the killers of Garden Grove Police Officer Howard E. 
Dallies Jr. and Manhattan Beach Police Officer Martin Ganz. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor said he hoped the rewards will "raise the profile of the 
investigation and attract more leads." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also announced that he is asking the Legislature to introduce a bill to 
increase to $100,000 the maximum reward for cases where a peace officer is 
killed in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallies, of Garden Grove, was gunned down by a motorcyclist on March 9 of last 
year, and Ganz, also a Garden Grove resident, was shot and killed during a 
traffic stop in December. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, all cop killers deserve the death penalty," Wilson 
said, adding that there is "no more fitting tribute that we can make to these 
slain officers than to assure their families of our resolve to take action 
swiftly to bring their killers to justice." 
</P>
<P>
 The governor, who is expected to face a tough reelection battle this year, 
made his announcement in a ceremony at the Los Angeles Police Officers 
Memorial. The choice of that telegenic setting in vote-rich Southern California 
underscores Wilson's desire to boost his public profile as a tough 
crime-fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the state Penal Code, Wilson has the power to issue monetary rewards of 
up to $50,000 for information leading to the arrest of prison escapees or 
persons responsible for capital offenses. The rewards must be requested by 
local law enforcement agencies. During his Administration, Wilson has offered 
four such rewards. 
</P>
<P>
 Police in Garden Grove said they were pleased by the governor's announcement 
and expressed hope that the money would help spark news clues that might lead 
to a break in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "This certainly is a nice gesture," said Sgt. George Jaramillo. "Any time we 
have something that enhances our chances of getting new leads, we're happy." 
</P>
<P>
 After Dallies was killed, nearly 40 investigators from seven police 
departments banded together to form the largest homicide task force in Orange 
County history. In June the task force was scaled back to about a dozen 
investigators. It was disbanded late last year as most of the fresh leads were 
exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
 But investigators aren't even close to giving up, Jaramillo said. Detectives 
continue to pore over the evidence they have, sifting through old clues to be 
sure they haven't missed anything.  
</P>
<P>
 Police have produced a computer-enhanced sketch of the murder suspect showing 
a man with long blond hair topped with a blue baseball cap. Detectives believe 
the acne-scarred, young-looking man also was responsible for severely wounding 
Santa Ana security guard Rene Carpio in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In Manhattan Beach, police are continuing to hunt for the killer of Ganz, who 
had purchased his boyhood home in Garden Grove just before he was killed.

RAFTER RAISES A GLASS, THEN OUSTS COURIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are signs that young Patrick Rafter, only 21 and already ranked 49th in 
the world, is quickly catching on to the formula for being a truly great 
Australian tennis player. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he served and volleyed and beat one of the top players in the game in 
the Newsweek Champions Cup, ousting defending champion Jim Courier Tuesday in a 
1 1/2-hour first-rounder, 7-6 (7-2), 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, afterward, he described his prematch preparation as follows: "I came in 
here pretty low. All I did the last three weeks was lose in the first round in 
singles and doubles. So I decided to come here, just kind of stuff it, relax 
and have a beer." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, an Australian star is brewing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stands, watching Rafter put Courier on ice, were a couple of Aussie 
past-masters of tennis and tall cool ones, Ken Rosewall and Rod Laver. From 
that pair, along with the likes of John Newcombe, Tony Roche and Fred Stolle, 
comes a tradition of excellence in quickness to the net and to the keg. The 
Aussies have been winners who have always had a barrel of fun. Literally. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rafter had some bad moments against an always-battling Courier, all he 
had to do was glance up into the stands for moral support. Locating Rosewall 
and Laver might have been made easier by simply looking for the sun reflecting 
off metal cans.  
</P>
<P>
 "Muscles and Rocket," he said. "Good to know those guys are there watching. 
Those are two of the greatest players ever. I think you'll see the Aussies come 
up on top again soon." 
</P>
<P>
 There would be no argument on that from Courier, the still-struggling No. 3 
player in the world, who summed it all up pretty well afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patrick played a good match and served very well," Courier said. "Other than 
that, it's all he had to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The implication was that Courier didn't do much of anything very well, and 
that made him the exception on a day when all the other seeded players, 
including No. 1 Pete Sampras and comeback-bound Andre Agassi, advanced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't strike the ball well," Courier said. "The match seemed to go 
much quicker than I wanted it to. I wasn't able to work myself into it like I 
like to." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras, No. 1 in the world, had no such trouble working himself into his 
match with veteran Spaniard Emilio Sanchez. He came out slugging, and 1 hour 1 
minute later was still firing bullet serves and bullet passing shots and even 
bullet volleys at a completed overwhelmed Sanchez. The score was 6-1, 6-1. 
Sanchez said, "He destroyed me." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras fired seven aces at Sanchez, hit 36 winners, won 90% of the points 
played when he got his first serve in and 80% of the points played when he came 
to the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish this could happen everyday," Sampras said, "but unfortunately, it 
can't." 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi went through Richey Reneberg in the night session, 6-3, 6-3, which was 
not surprising, despite Agassi's drop from top-10 status to No. 31 while 
sitting out with a wrist injury that required surgery late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 What was surprising was the appearance of the new Agassi image in the press 
gathering afterward. Once the subject of rock 'n roll tennis and the object of 
groupies galore, a slimmer, trimmer, apparently deeper Agassi described his new 
approach to tennis and life. 
</P>
<P>
 "My time away was the most important of my life," he said, sounding almost 
professorial. "I've been doing this since I was a little kid, when your dad 
hands you a racket and you go play. Then you go to an academy at age 13, you 
don't go to college and soon you turn pro. You are always playing for reasons 
that are not long term. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I realize that tennis is a part of who I am, and it is also a platform 
for the obstacles that I face." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said, "Image isn't everything. Express yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Other seeded players advancing were No. 7 Todd Martin, 6-0, 4-6, 6-1 over 
Marcos Ondruska of South Africa; No. 10 Petra Korda of the Czech Republic, 7-5, 
6-1 over Mark Woodforde of Australia; No. 11 Marc Rosset of Switzerland, 3-6, 
6-2, 6-2 over Gilbert Schaller of Austria; No. 12 Alexander Volkov of Russia, 
6-4, 6-4 over Jim Grabb, and No. 15 MaliVai Washington, 6-4, 6-0 over David 
Nainkin of South Africa. . . . Jim Courier, on the difference between this year 
and last year, when he won: "Last year, it was Jim with a trophy over his head. 
This year, it is Jim with a golf club in his hands." . . . Courier's record 
here was 16-3 going into Tuesday's match. . . . Tuesday's attendance, the 
expected new record, was 15,967. The day session was 9,966, the night 6,001. 
Monday's record was 14,561.

<P>
 The Orlando Magic's run at first place in the Eastern Division stalled in 
Houston on Tuesday night as Shaquille O'Neal was no match for Hakeem Olajuwon. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon scored 26 points and Sam Cassell got all his 16 points in the second 
half as the Rockets ended the Magic's seven-game winning streak, 97-85. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassell did not score until 1:19 remained in the third quarter. Then he 
equaled a season high as the Rockets ended a two-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon helped hold O'Neal, the league's leading scorer, to 19 points on 
eight-for-19 shooting. Olajuwon was aided by Otis Thorpe's 19 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really came out and swarmed on defense against Shaq, and it was tough to 
get him one-on-one," said Coach Brian Hill of Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 112, Charlotte 96 -- Kendall Gill and Gary Payton broke loose in the 
second half and finished with 21 and 20 points, respectively, as the 
SuperSonics rallied in the fourth quarter at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 102, Minnesota 99 -- Danny Manning, in his home debut for the Hawks, 
made a 12-foot jumper with eight seconds left, salvaging a victory. Manning 
scored 21 points on eight-for-13 shooting and Stacey Augmon had 21 points. 
Christian Laettner scored 21 points for Minnesota, which has lost 11 in a row 
on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 106, Portland 94 -- Rik Smits had 24 points and 13 rebounds, his fifth 
consecutive game with more than 10 in each category, as the Pacers ended the 
Trail Blazers' six-game winning streak in a game at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 108, Detroit 98 -- Chris Morris continued his tear from three-point 
range by making a team-record six as the Nets overcame a slow start at East 
Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 109, Philadelphia 103 -- Pervis Ellison had season highs of 25 
points and 12 rebounds as the Bullets ended a six-game losing streak and 
extended the 76ers' losing streak to 10 at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 110, Milwaukee 102 -- Glen Rice scored 25 points, including 16 in the 
first quarter at Milwaukee, and Grant Long had a season-high 22 as the Heat 
went five games above the .500 mark for the first time in franchise history.

 New York 100, Sacramento 88 -- Patrick Ewing scored 28 points and had a 
season-high 21 rebounds as the Knicks ended a four-game losing streak with the 
win at Sacramento. Greg Anthony scored 18 points and John Starks had 16.

NOTHING UNIQUE AS CLIPPERS COLLAPSE AGAIN; PRO BASKETBALL: THE WARRIORS GO ON A 
23-7 RUN IN FOURTH QUARTER AND END THREE-GAME SKID, 114-109. 
</P>

 Dominique Wilkins sighed as he began to discuss the Clippers' fourth-quarter 
collapse against Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading by 14 points going into the final quarter, the Clippers were outscored 
by 39-20 in the last 12 minutes en route to losing for the seventh time in 
their last eight games, 114-109, before a sellout crowd of 15,025. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just kind of gave it away in the end," Wilkins said. "But the effort was 
there tonight. This is a different Clipper team than I've seen in a long time. 
The last two games we should have won, but we're going to get some things to go 
our way. We went through a stretch in Atlanta where we had games like this. 
Every team goes through stretches like this. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I understand, before they didn't play with that intensity, and now 
that intensity is there." 
</P>
<P>
 After shooting 52.1% in the first three quarters, the Clippers shot 32% in the 
fourth quarter, missing 13 of 19 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't make the shots we needed to make," Clipper Coach Bob Weiss 
said. "We didn't make the big shots. When you miss against these guys, they're 
going to run you." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, who had a game-high 29 points and 11 rebounds, scored only two points 
in the fourth quarter, missing three of four shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Harper, who had 22 points, missed three of five shots in the final quarter 
and guard Gary Grant, who had 19 points, missed all three shots he took in the 
last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Warrior guard Latrell Sprewell had nine of his 27 points in the final quarter 
and Chris Mullin had nine of his 13 points. Sprewell made three of four shots 
in the fourth quarter and Mullin made four of five shots as the Warriors shot 
58% in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie forward Chris Webber, the first player selected in the 1993 NBA draft, 
celebrated his 21st birthday by getting 26 points and a season-high 18 
rebounds, including 11 offensive rebounds as the Warriors ended a three-game 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading by 98-87 with 8:06 remaining, they went on a 23-7 run to take a 
110-105 lead. The Clippers went 2:11 without scoring as Golden State took 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to give Golden State a lot of credit," said Clipper rookie guard 
Terry Dehere, who had 11 points in a reserve role. "A 10-point lead is not 
much, you still have to concentrate and make every possession a good one." 
</P>
<P>
 Leading by 74-71, the Clippers outscored the Warriors 15-4 in the last 5:37 of 
the third quarter to take an 89-75 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper had seven points in the spurt, making a three-pointer and two layups 
and Wilkins, who had 12 points in the quarter, had four points, making a layup 
and two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 But they fell apart for the second game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who lost by 46 points in their last game here, don't usually 
attract many fans on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 But that has apparently changed, now that they have acquired Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
 When Wilkins was introduced, a fan dressed in a Clipper hat and red satin 
jacket held up a homemade sign that read: "Dominique Wilkins rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Harper, suspended for one game for making negative comments, has filed a 
grievance against the team. The suspension cost Harper, who makes $4 million, 
$48,780.49. . . . Former Stanford star Todd Lichti, who was waived by Orlando 
on Wednesday, signed a 10-day contract with the Warriors on Monday. He was the 
15th player selected in the 1989 NBA draft.

MORNING BRIEFING: BIG LEFTY PROMISES TO GIVE NEW MEANING TO 'AIR' JORDAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Randy Johnson, Seattle's 6-foot-10 left-handed pitcher, isn't all that 
impressed with Michael Jordan's venture into major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see how much air time he'd get on one of my (inside) pitches," 
Johnson says. "He has a press conference every day and all he's doing is 
hitting 80-m.p.h. fastballs. Big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Johnson: He also says he is going to ask the Seattle SuperSonics for an 
NBA tryout because he "could probably block a 235-pounder out of the middle 
better than Jordan can hit a baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: In what league are the sports franchises known as Bullfrogs, 
Barracudas, Phantoms and Vipers? 
</P>
<P>
 One man's view: From Dave Kindred of the Sporting News: 
</P>
<P>
 "Johann Olav Koss is a Norwegian speedskating hero who set a world record in 
the 10,000 meters that may stand for half a century. . . . In his moment of 
victory, Koss announced what he would do with the $30,000 awarded him by 
Norway's Olympic Committee. He would send it to Sarajevo, where money is needed 
desperately. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps other athletes made private donations. Of Americans, only Bonnie 
Blair announced hers. She would give $5,000. Two seats away at a press 
conference, the new American millionaire Nancy Kerrigan did a recital of her 
soup contracts, shoe deals and sunglasses agreements before ending the spiel 
with a giggle. 'So many,' she says. She offered the Sarajevans nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Changing times: The Edmonton Oilers, who set an NHL record with 36 shorthanded 
goals in 1983-84, are the only team without one this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope springs eternal: He is 64 and hasn't won anything except a couple of 
Senior Skins since 1988, but Arnold Palmer has a feeling that he will win again 
on the Senior PGA Tour, maybe this week in the GTE West tournament at Ojai 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer underwent a sinus operation a few days after Christmas, but a month 
later he shot a 69 at Pebble Beach. Three similar rounds would win on the 
50-and-older circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that my game has improved a great deal, especially my iron play," 
Palmer says. "It's given me a lift to want to play a little more, too. As a 
result, I think that my new mind-set and my better game will make me more 
competitive this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Long season: If Florida's Bob Kudelski plays in all remaining Panther games, 
he will set an NHL record for most games played in the regular season -- 87. 
</P>
<P>
 Kudelski played 42 games for the Ottawa Senators before the Jan. 6 trade that 
brought him to Florida. The Panthers had only played 39 games when Kudelski 
arrived, so he has the chance to play in the remaining 45, establishing an NHL 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 Clever commercial: A motor oil company, showcasing national top-fuel champion 
Eddie Hill in a magazine layout, came up with this: 
</P>
<P>
 "On the NHRA drag racing circuit, there are 117 straightaways . . . but only 
one Hill." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Teams in the Roller Hockey International League. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Volleyball star Bob Samuelson, on why the U.S. team went through an 
18-38 season: "I don't think, in the middle of a game, we should be worrying 
about getting a bulkhead seat on the flight home." SHAV GLICK

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 My idea of an optimist is someone who believes Wayne Gretzky will break Gordie 
Howe's record with an empty-net goal. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 How long has it been since the Kings won a game? They beat the Mighty Ducks at 
Anaheim on Feb. 11. That was the day before the start of the Winter Olympics. 
Yeah, that long ago. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky needs five goals to reach 802 for his career. The Kings need one 
victory to reach 22 for the season. I'm not sure which will happen first. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 After the 3-3 tie with the Montreal Canadiens on Monday night, Gretzky, 
usually one of the most cooperative newspaper interview subjects in sports, 
fled the locker room before reporters arrived. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Kings, given a lift by Marty McSorley at wing, played well enough to win 
during their first Forum West game against Montreal since the Stanley Cup 
finals last April. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Melrose, on Canadien goaltender Patrick Roy: "As long as he's there, 
they've got a chance to win the Stanley Cup." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Among others impressed was former King goaltender Gary (Scoop) Edwards, who 
was a guest commentator on the Montreal radio broadcast, and is starting a 
painting contracting business in Thousand Oaks. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I like Robb Stauber's fighting spirit. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 USC expects to double its previous biggest Sports Arena crowd of the year -- 
6,123 last Saturday for the overtime victory over California -- when UCLA makes 
its annual visit Thursday night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans have won four of the last six meetings, but the Bruins have a 
105-91 edge in the series. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA was 19-59 against USC until Coach John Wooden arrived in Westwood in 
1948. Wooden was 61-20 against the cross-town rival. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The only school that has a winning record against UCLA in more than 20 games 
is Brigham Young (11-10). . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins hope to return to the Sports Arena on March 24 and 26 for the NCAA 
West Regionals, which already are sold out. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Purdue forward Glenn Robinson is favored, but Connecticut forward Donyell 
Marshall will get some Eastern support for player-of-the-year honors. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Both the Connecticut men's and women's basketball teams are ranked fourth in 
the Associated Press polls. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Among the best little-known players in the nation is Missouri guard Melvin 
Booker, who is a major reason the Tigers remain unbeaten in the Big Eight. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams are able to sign a relatively young, free-agent quarterback such 
as Scott Mitchell or Chris Miller, they won't have to draft a passer in the 
first round. Most NFL scouts don't rate Trent Dilfer or Heath Shuler as highly 
as they did Drew Bledsoe or Rick Mirer last year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Rickey Henderson batting third? It could happen this season if Oakland 
Athletic rookie speedster Kerwin Moore is able to win the center field job. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 A nice comeback story would be that of Bobby Ojeda, who is among the early 
surprises in the New York Yankees' camp. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Zaun has a good shot to emulate uncle Rick Dempsey by making the 
Baltimore Orioles' roster as a catcher. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 You will have to go to Japan to see Rob Deer, Dan Gladden or Mike Pagliarulo 
play baseball this season. . . .  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The inaugural Southern Classic, a two-month series of races featuring members 
of the U.S. national cycling team, will be held at the Olympic Velodrome at Cal 
State Dominguez Hills starting Sunday. Mark (the Outlaw) Whitehead, a former 
national champion who is billing himself as the Lenny Dykstra of cycling, will 
attempt a comeback after a five-year retirement. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Look-alikes: Derrick Coleman and rapper Dr. Dre. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Leading welterweight contender Yory Boy Campas has the longest winning streak 
in pro boxing. He won his 55th consecutive fight and scored his 50th knockout 
recently in Tijuana, where 2,500 fans were turned away. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Pernell Whitaker's first bout since his "draw" with Julio Cesar Chavez will be 
on April 9 against Santos Cardona in a pay-per-view show from Norfolk, Va. Next 
might be a rematch with Buddy McGirt, who faces Livingstone Bramble on the same 
card. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I lost my rooting interest in the Santa Anita Handicap when Diazo, trained by 
Bill Shoemaker and ridden by Laffit Pincay, was withdrawn because of a training 
injury. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the most intriguing race of the weekend is Sunday's San Rafael 
Stakes, which will bring together some of the best Kentucky Derby prospects. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Please say it's not true that Ted Williams, who could tell when a baseball was 
thrown a millimeter outside the plate, has been left with poor eyesight after a 
stroke.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: EASTERN SIERRA GETS A REPRIEVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eastern Sierra lakes and streams will not be shortchanged, after all. 
</P>
<P>
 A 20% cut in the number of trout planted in the Eastern Sierra was averted 
when the Department of Fish and Game decided to take other measures, such as 
hiring freezes and schedule changes, to compensate for a reduction in federal 
funds to operate its hatchery program. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Boyd Gibbons said the department "will be stocking more fish 
earlier," which means fewer fish will be stocked later in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbons' plan will begin with the stocking of more than 45,000 catchable 
rainbow trout in Inyo County before Saturday's early trout season opener -- 
general trout season begins April 30. Inyo and Mono County waters will get 
about 278,000 trout before the general season opener, more than three times as 
many as were planted before previous season openers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatchery supervisor Mike Haynie said that taking more trout out of the 
hatcheries early in the season will not only save the DFG money used for their 
upkeep, but will reduce "pond loading" and help the remaining trout to grow 
faster and larger, which should enable hatchery personnel to plant larger -- 
but fewer -- fish as the season progresses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two lakes, six streams and 55 miles of the Owens River will be stocked before 
Saturday's early season opener, with 19,000 fish earmarked for Independence 
Creek, George Creek, Lone Pine Creek, Tuttle Creek, Symms Creek and Cottonwood 
Creek; the Owens River below Tinemaha Reservoir, Diaz Lake and Pleasant Valley 
Reservoir. More than 26,000 trout have already been stocked in parts of the 
Owens River and Pleasant Valley Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anglers are now required to display their licenses on their clothing while 
fishing, or face being fined by DFG wardens. The new regulation went into 
effect Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 SALTWATER -- Southland fishermen are still waiting for the pre-spring white 
seabass bite to start near the Channel Islands, meanwhile settling for mostly 
rock cod and rockfish. According to Cortez Yacht Charters in Lemon Grove, an 
early season surface bite has begun at San Martin Island off Baja California. 
The Holiday returned from a 2 1/2-day trip to San Diego late last week with 45 
yellowtail to 18 pounds, more than 200 barracuda and a 28-pound white seabass. 
Cabo San Lucas: Fishing has been so good for marlin that anglers have been 
hard-pressed to find a boat, but that should change because marlin fishing is 
finally beginning to slow. Boats are still averaging one to three fish a day, 
however. Wahoo are either becoming more abundant or more willing to strike 
lures, and dorado action is picking up. 
</P>
<P>
 SHOWTIME -- Representatives of the great outdoors will be packed indoors today 
through March 6 during the annual Fred Hall Western Fishing and Tackle Show at 
the Long Beach Convention Center. But peddlers of boats, fishing, hunting and 
camping gear and outdoors-related vacations are only part of the show. Kids can 
fish for trout in an outdoor pond; novice fishermen can pick up tips from 
experts, and prospective big-game fishermen can get a taste of the experience 
by sitting in a mechanical fighting chair. Also on hand will be the United 
Anglers of Southern California. The group will be asking for support in its 
battles against Senate Bill 1478, which would open the Catalina Channel to 
gill-net fishermen between July 15 and Aug. 15, and against the recent influx 
of longline fishing vessels into Southland ports -- notably Ventura Harbor. 
Show hours are Wednesday through Friday from 2-10 p.m.; Saturday from 10 
a.m.-10 p.m., and Sunday from 10 a.m.-7 p.m. Cost is $7.50 for adults and free 
for children 12 and younger. 
</P>
<P>
 HUNTING -- A series of special wild turkey hunts is scheduled to begin on 
March 26 at Lake Mendocino, east of Ukiah. Access is by boat only. Method of 
take is by shotgun or archery. Hunt days are Saturdays and Wednesdays during 
the spring wild turkey season through April 30. Hunters may apply for one date 
only by mailing a standard U.S. Postal Service postcard listing their name, 
mailing address, hunting license number, boat registration number and one date 
of their choice. Two hunters may apply on one card. Applications mailed to the 
Department of Fish and Game -- Lake Mendocino Spring Turkey Hunt, P.O. Box 47, 
Yountville, CA. 94599 -- must be received by March 15 to be included in the 
drawing. Successful applicants will be notified. 
</P>
<P>
 CONSERVATION -- The South Bay Chapter of the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation 
will hold its second annual banquet-auction Saturday at 5 p.m. at the Los 
Angeles Convention Center. Proceeds will be used for the preservation of elk 
resource and habitat. Cost is $90 per couple, $60 single. Details: (310) 
539-2272. 
</P>
<P>
 CALENDAR -- Tom Ishkanian of the Sport Chalet fishing department will give a 
presentation on fishing the West at the South Bay Flyfishers' meeting tonight 
at 7 at the Westchester Townhouse. . . . Ventura College is offering beginning 
fly-fishing classes for four weeks -- the last two in area waters -- beginning 
Saturday, with Jerry Bliss as instructor. Cost is $85. Details: (805) 647-4245 
or (805) 654-6459. . . . Jim Criner, an authority on fly-fishing in Montana, 
will give a presentation Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. in the community room at Rio San 
Gabriel Park in Downey. Details: (310) 425-7936. . . . Don Bullock's California 
Gun & Collector's Show & Sale will be held March 12-13 at the Fairplex in

FISHING REPORT: SUDDENLY, LAKE PIRU A BASS HAVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lake Piru is not reputed to be a bass fishery like nearby Lake Casitas and 
Castaic Lake, but in the past week anglers at the Ventura County reservoir did 
much to boost its reputation as such. 
</P>
<P>
 Aron Masters of Chatsworth, fishing with plastic worms throughout the lake, 
caught and released 60 bass, including two 5-pounders. Dick Denlinger of 
Moorpark, meanwhile, hauled in a 13 1/2-pounder that attacked his Rapala lure. 
Garrett Godfrey of Fillmore, was fishing for trout with Power Bait in a marina 
when a 9-pounder struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here 15 years and I've never seen anything like it," marina manager 
Art Caldara said.

INGLEWOOD TURNS UP HEAT, MOVES CLOSER TO SECTION TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Finally, the pressure worked, the steals came and Inglewood was on the brink 
of its first Southern Section II-AA championship since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sentinels' relentless full-court press eventually wore down No. 8 ranked 
Santa Barbara early in the fourth quarter when they blew the game open and 
cruised to a 70-53 win in the Division II-AA semifinals Tuesday night before 
300 at Morningside High. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought if we could keep the pressure on them, it would get to them," 
Sentinel Coach Patrick Roy said. "They broke down." 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-ranked Inglewood (27-3) forced 15 turnovers and held the No. 8 Dons 
(27-3) to one field goal (a three-pointer at the buzzer) in the fourth quarter. 
The Sentinels, who led 34-32 at the half, and 52-45 after three periods, 
outscored the Dons, 18-8, in the final quarter. Inglewood will play Riverside 
North (28-0) for the title Saturday at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought they could press them, but they seemed real calm in the first 
half," said Inglewood 6-4 junior forward Paul Pierce, who had a game-high 34 
points, 12 rebounds, seven steals and three blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "That kid's a superstar," said Don Coach Bob Purdy. "We couldn't stop him. He 
could shoot it outside, inside and rebound." 
</P>
<P>
 Jabari Simmons, a 6-foot-6 senior center led Santa Barbara with 20 points, but 
only six came after intermission.  
</P>
<P>
 "We said we weren't going to just let him cut across the key and get the 
ball," Roy said. "For him to beat us, he would have to beat us at the foul 
line." 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons was two for seven from the free throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 Don sophomore point guard Mike Garrett had particular trouble handling the 
ball against the constant harassing of senior guard Sam Turks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not used to that type of pressure," Purdy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Garrett: "He talked to me and tried to get me out of my game and he did a 
good job."

DIVISION II-A BOYS' BASKETBALL; TUSTIN'S DELAY CAN'T SLOW ROUT BY NO. 1 
DOMINGUEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tustin High looked like the steppingstone it was meant to be Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton Dominguez, which came oh-so-close to a Southern Section title a year 
ago, stomped the Tillers, 70-35, in the Division II-A boys' semifinals at 
Compton College. Dominguez will play Bellflower St. John Bosco on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a return engagement for the Dons (27-2), who lost to Riverside J.W. North 
by a point last season when Jamie Gillin missed a jumper at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way our kids looked at it, anything short of reaching the title game 
would have been an unsuccessful season," Dominguez Coach Russell Otis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin (22-8) never had a chance. The Dons, the division's top-seeded team, 
were bigger, quicker and had more depth. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, the Tillers took a stab at some strategy. They opened the game in a delay, 
trying to squeeze time off the clock. It didn't even delay the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 After nine possessions, Tustin was zero for six from the field and had four 
turnovers. The Tillers didn't even score until Doug Gottlieb made a layup with 
2 minutes 24 seconds left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons, who have won 18 consecutive games, scored the first 11 points and 
were ahead, 19-2, at the end of the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were overwhelming . . . just overwhelming," Tustin Coach Andy Ground 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons, who use five players 6 feet 4 or taller, outrebounded Tustin, 44-14. 
The Tillers have only one player taller than 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Price scored 15 points and had 10 rebounds. Daryl Todd had 13 points and 
eight rebounds. Gillin had 11 and five. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a team pounds the glass like that against us, we have no chance," Ground 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez got the Tillers down and made sure they stayed there with a stifling 
defense. The Dons led, 50-14, after three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin made only 13 of 58 shots. So unnerved were the Tillers, that they threw 
up nine airballs. Gottlieb, the Tillers' leading scorer, had four. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Aguilar had made five three-pointers and scored 21 points in the 
quarterfinal victory over Pasadena Muir. He went scoreless, missing all seven 
of his shots.

DIVISION II BOYS' SOCCER; MATER DEI TOPS LONG BEACH WILSON'S CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mater Dei badly outplayed a listless Long Beach Wilson team for 75 minutes but 
only the last five mattered. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-seeded Wilson scored the tying goal with five minutes left and the game 
appeared to be headed for overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mater Dei never blinked and senior Ryan Chaput scored with barely more 
than a minute left to give the Monarchs a 2-1 victory Tuesday and their first 
Southern Section boys' soccer final appearance in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-seeded Mater Dei will meet Esperanza at 8 p.m. Friday at Gahr High 
School in the Division II final. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that we dominated and I felt in my heart of hearts that we could do it 
anyway," Mater Dei Coach Martin Stringer said. "We got what we deserved 
(Tuesday)." 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei (22-2-4) outshot Wilson (20-3-3), 17-7, was quicker to the ball and 
was more aggressive than the Bruins throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 After a scoreless first half, the Monarchs scored in the opening 30 seconds of 
the second half on Kevin Quigley's header (his 22nd goal) that rebounded to him 
after Mike McCabe's shot hit the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the first header he's had all season," Stringer said. 'He couldn't 
have picked a better time." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson took only one shot in the next 35 minutes to Mater Dei's 11, but the 
Bears scored when Chris Levy rebounded Pat Baldwin's header. 
</P>
<P>
 "It set us back, totally," Quigley said. "But our coach keeps telling us to 
keep our heads up." 
</P>
<P>
 Quigley had his head up when he received Danny Smith's throw-in, turned his 
defender and nailed a crossing pass to Chaput, who only needed to tap the ball 
into an open net.

DIVISION I GIRLS' SOCCER; SHIFT HURTS CAPISTRANO VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley got soft. Palos Verdes Peninsula got psyched. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section Division I girls' soccer teams changed during the second 
half of their semifinal game Tuesday at Capistrano Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
 The personality shift worked in Peninsula's favor and the Panthers won, 2-1, 
to advance to Friday's final against top-seeded Marina. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we'd beat them; it hasn't hit me," said senior forward Kim McKay, 
who scored to give the a 1-0 lead in the first half. "We took that halftime 
lead and I think we thought we weren't going to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 On an assist by halfback Lindsay Light, McKay found the open net 23 minutes 
into the game. The Cougars had several other scoring threats before the half 
but couldn't connect. 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula got the momentum it needed 16 minutes into the second half, when 
Capistrano Valley (21-5-3) was slapped with a dangerous-play foul and the 
Panthers (26-1-3) were awarded a free kick. Sasha Danna kicked from the left 
side and inside the midfield mark. Teammate Traci Arkenberg headed it in for a 
1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "They scored their first goal on a call that was controversial at best," 
Cougar Coach Harry Hutcheson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said McKay: "Everyone was stunned. If we would have gone into overtime, we 
would have won. We would have wanted it more." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars never got the chance. They never recovered from the shock. 
</P>
<P>
 With five minutes left, Arkenberg beat fullback Erin Conners to the ball. As 
goalie Sheila Teran came out of the box to defend, Arkenberg jumped over Teran 
and scored the winning goal on the run. 
</P>
<P>
 They were her 54th and 55th goals of the season. Capistrano Valley knew about 
the UCLA-bound senior, but couldn't defend against her for both halves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arkenberg was the player we need to keep off the ball, and she scored both 
their goals," Hutcheson said.

DIVISION II GIRLS' SOCCER; TOP-SEEDED TEAM KNOCKS OUT CANYON, 2-1 
</P>

<P>
 Canyon took a one-goal lead into the second half, but couldn't hang on and 
fell, 2-1, to visiting Torrance Bishop Montgomery in a Southern Section 
Division II girls' soccer semifinal Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comanches (17-6-3), who reached the Division II final last season, entered 
the game as heavy underdogs to the top-seeded Knights (20-2-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the first half, Canyon struck first, when Kim Nelson passed to 
Kerry Anderson leading a three-on-none break. Anderson pushed the ball to the 
left of goalkeeper Celeste Adams for the early advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead held until the Knights scored with about 20 minutes left to play.  
</P>
<P>
 Canyon goalkeeper Robin Schmidt came out of the box trying to cut off the 
angle on a Bishop Montgomery corner kick. The ball slid past her in front of 
the goal and right to Bishop Montgomery's Bridgett Arnett, who kicked it in. 
The referee ruled that the ball cleared the goal line just before two Canyon 
defenders cleared it. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two minutes later, Schmidt left the box again and Michelle Kallas 
kicked it into the upper left corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was (Schmidt's) call to go out and try to mess up the play," Canyon Coach 
John Williams said. "Their girl had no angle at all. I thought the first goal 
was cleared, but the referee had a much better angle than I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams snuffed out Canyon's chances late in the second half, recording three of 
her seven saves in the last 10 minutes. Schmidt had eight saves for Canyon. JON

 Esperanza and Buena played 120 minutes of scoreless soccer before the Aztecs 
finally won the game on the last shot of the shootout in a Southern Section 
Division II girls' soccer game Tuesday at Buena. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza's Kim Gallo kicked the ball past goalkeeper Stacy Hebert to give the 
Aztecs the shootout, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Unseeded Esperanza (20-5-4) advanced to the title game against top-seeded 
Bishop Montgomery at 2 p.m. Saturday at Cerritos Gahr High. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the way I planned it to happen," Esperanza Coach Phyllis 
Scarborough said. "Nobody likes to go the finals on a shootout, but those are 
the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Montgomery (20-2-2) reached the final with a 2-1 victory over Canyon 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena (21-3-5) went up in the shootout, 1-0, on a goal from Monica Almaraz. 
Esperanza tied it on a goal by Jenny Parkison. Megan Munday and Barbara Almaraz 
scored for Buena and Tammy Lyon and Diana Guy kept it even for Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
 The key save came when Esperanza goalie Chris Gehrls knocked away a shot by 
Allyson Munday. That gave Gallo the chance to win it.

DIVISION II-A GIRLS' BASKETBALL; SAN BERNARDINO STOPS CYPRESS SHORT OF GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After attaining its preseason goal of qualifying for a playoff semifinal for 
the first time, the Cypress girls' basketball team, quite naturally, revised 
its expectations of what would constitute a completely successful season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centurions believed this was their season, and they wanted to make their 
convictions known to San Bernardino in the Southern Section Division II-A 
semifinals Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Cypress, San Bernardino has goals of its own, and the 
Cardinals made their point with a 60-51 victory over second-seeded Cypress at 
Kennedy High. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just lost to a better team," Cypress Coach John Selbe said. "They hit all 
the big shots and they did a lot of things right. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a very good team . . . I hope they go on and win the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 San Andreas League champion San Bernardino (25-4) will play top-seeded Mission 
Hills Alemany (27-0) for the Division II-A championship Saturday at Cal Poly 
Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centurions trailed by 18 points, 44-26, with 36 seconds remaining in the 
third quarter. But Cypress charged back in the fourth quarter behind standout 
senior center Jessica Eggleston and junior forward Julie Adams -- and with a 
little help from the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino missed its first six free throws of the quarter, allowing the 
Centurions to close the gap. Eggleston scored 10 of her 17 points in the 
quarter and Adams scored seven of her game-high 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Two free throws by Eggleston with 1:40 remaining cut San Bernardino's lead to 
five, 54-49. But two free throws by the Cardinals' La Tonya Kindle (15 points) 
and a layup by Kizzy Hollman following an offensive rebound put San Bernardino 
ahead by nine, 58-49, with 1:15 to play.

DIVISION I GIRLS' SOCCER; TOP-SEEDED MARINA BEATS MATER DEI FOR ANOTHER SHOT IN 
FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Marina's 3-1 victory over Mater Dei in the Southern Section Division I girls' 
soccer semifinals Tuesday at Mater Dei High was a perfect example of why the 
Vikings have a 37-game unbeaten streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs (20-6-1) threw everything they had at Marina (26-0-1) in the 
first half and went in at halftime tied, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 But the top-seeded Vikings -- who last lost Jan. 27, 1993, to Edison -- never 
panicked, stuck to their game plan and dominated the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcy Crouch and Amy Rubenstein scored second-half goals for Marina, which 
outshot Mater Dei, 14-1, in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings advanced to the final to face Palos Verdes Peninsula (23-1-3) at 6 
p.m. Friday at Cerritos Gahr High. Marina tied Claremont, 1-1, in the Division 
I title game last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been waiting about a year for this," Marina Coach Bobby Bruch said. 
"After tying for the championship last year, it was like getting teased with 
just the whipped cream and cherry on the top of a chocolate shake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that we're back in the finals, we want to down it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Crouch helped put Marina into the final, scoring on a corner kick in the 55th 
minute. Crouch hooked her kick into the upper right corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "That goal kind of deflated us," Mater Dei Coach Michelle Myers said. "In the 
second half, I think the kids started to realize they were getting tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubenstein's goal in the 65th minute gave Marina a 3-1 lead and the Monarchs 
never threatened in the final 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina scored the game's first goal in the 15th minute on a header by junior 
Cassie Campbell off a centering pass by Rubenstein. It was Campbell's 28th goal 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 24th minute, Mater Dei's Teresa Buechler sprinted up the right side and 
sent a crossing pass to the middle of the penalty area where Sara Stratton 
knocked the ball past Marina goalie Jennifer Simmons for a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton got another great scoring chance in the final minute of the half, but 
Simmons denied her making a leaping save on a shot from the top of the penalty 
area.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Esperanza needed overtime, sudden death and then a shootout Tuesday to earn a 
chance to defend its Southern Section Division II boys' soccer title. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza and top-seeded Santa Barbara were tied, 1-1, after regulation and 
overtime, but the Aztecs won the shootout, 3-2.Esperanza (18-5-5) will play 
Mater Dei (23-2-4) for the title at 8 p.m. Saturday at Cerritos Gahr High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza led the shootout, 3-2, when Santa Barbara's Garrett Cole set up for 
the final kick, but Aztec goalie Jason Fiske drove to his right to knock away 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara (26-2-2) took a 1-0 lead in the first half on a goal by Carlos 
Moralas. Esperanza came back to tie it about 17 minutes into the first half 
when Mark Alleman scored his 19th goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara appeared to have scored three minutes later, but the official 
waved off the goal saying it was supposed to be an indirect kick, not a free 
kick. JOHN ZANT

DIVISION IV BOYS' SOCCER; LA HABRA LOSES MOMENTUM, GAME TO EL MONTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The La Habra boys' soccer team lost to El Monte, 4-1, in a Southern Section 
Division IV semifinal game Thursday at El Monte High. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra (18-6-1) scored seven minutes into the game.Brendan Malm passed the 
ball to John Mendrin, who kicked it in from the top of the penalty box. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions, Mission Valley League champions for the past five years, recovered 
by scoring four minutes later. Alex Lemus headed the ball toward the middle of 
the goal, and Juan Sedano kicked it in. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders, making their first appearance in postseason play, never 
regained their momentum, allowing El Monte (23-0-2) to score two more goals 
before the half -- one on a penalty kick by Limas, and the other when Sedano 
guided in Felipe Rodriguez's corner kick over diving goalie Javier Flores. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a little more heart than they did at the beginning, but we weren't 
consistent with our aggressive play, that's why we lost the game," said La 
Habra Coach Mario Munoz, who is in his first year.  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the first half, when El Monte outshot La Habra, 8-2, the ball spent 
time near both goals in the second half. But by the end of the game, the 
out-manned and ill-matched Highlanders wore the dogged expressions of men 
trying to stave off the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Sedano scored his third goal from about 20 yards, on a pass from Cesar Jimenez 
with two minutes left.

DIVISION IV BOYS' SOCCER; SANTA MARGARITA FAILS TO GET PAST RIVERSIDE POLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELANIE NEFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Margarita, the defending  
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section champion, failed to capitalize on the shaky first-half play 
of top-seeded Riverside Poly , and lost, 1-0, in the Southern Section Division 
IV boys' soccer semifinals Tuesday at Santa Margarita High. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside Poly (27-0-1) started slow in the first half, with the Eagles 
outshooting the Bears, 9-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were nervous," Poly Coach Tom Wilson said. "We just kept knocking 
the ball out and our forwards were exhausted." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita (16-5-5) had four open-shot opportunities in the first half 
but couldn't score.  
</P>
<P>
 Senior defenseman Jeff Maguire was outstanding on both ends, keeping Poly's 
forwards in check and taking three shots of his own, one of which bounced off 
the post with five minutes left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were unlucky," Eagle Coach Curt Bauer said. "We needed to get a couple in, 
in the first half when we had the chance." 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, Santa Margarita's chances were few. Poly took two quick 
shots in the first two minutes and kept Santa Margarita goalkeeper Mike Greco 
on his toes. 
</P>
<P>
 Poly's Julio Luna and Israel Baltazar controlled the ball for most of the 
second half, but Marc Dunbar finally put it into the net. With 26 minutes left, 
Danny Mann passed the ball to Dunbar in front of the goal and Dunbar drilled a 
shot just beyond Greco's reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did exactly what we expected," Bauer said. "They faked a cross pass and 
beat us across the line." 
</P>
<P>
 With five minutes left, Santa Margarita, led by junior Seth George, put the 
pressure on with five scoring opportunities, all on free kicks and throw-ins. 
But the Bears defense held.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / MIKE DIGIOVANNA: NO. 1 BASEBALL TEAM WILL STILL 
TRY HARDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sunday's 2-0 victory over Georgia Tech propelled Cal State Fullerton to the 
top spot in two of the nation's three major college baseball polls, but there 
were no balloons or party streamers in the Titan baseball office Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton coaches, mindful of the Titans' swoon after ascending to No. 2 
midway through the 1993 season, were in no mood to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 They saw what happened after last season's 14-game winning streak and 22-7 
start -- a 13-12 finish, including three losses to Long Beach State, and 
elimination in the NCAA Central II Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 They know better. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't continue to improve last year," said George Horton, associate head 
coach. "We got happy with what we had done, and our work habits were not as 
good. The Long Beach series sent a shock wave through us, and we never 
recovered." 
</P>
<P>
 Horton and head Coach Augie Garrido already have taken measures to avoid 
another letdown this season, challenging players more in practice and devising 
ways to make practices more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our responsibility not to let complacency set in," Horton said. "We want 
the players' mind set to be the same in practice as it is games." 
</P>
<P>
 The coaches are encouraged by the fact that this is a veteran team -- six 
position starters and six pitchers are back from the 1993 team, and several say 
they have learned from last year's mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 And Horton and Garrido still don't think the Titans have played their best 
baseball, even though they're 15-2, ranked No. 1 by Collegiate Baseball 
Magazine and USA Today and No. 2 by Baseball America, behind Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still feel we have a long way to go," Horton said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Upon further review: A recount of ticket stubs from Sunday's Anaheim Hilton & 
Towers finale between Fullerton and previously top-ranked Georgia Tech revealed 
the crowd to be 1,920, not 1,861, as was reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way it was a Titan Sports Complex sellout, one that was achieved 
without the benefit of Kevin Costner on the marquee. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of more than 2,000 saw the movie star help christen the stadium in 
1992, the only other sellout in three years, but fans came Sunday for the 
glitter of a big game, not a big name. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton also attracted 1,623 for Saturday's game against Oklahoma, and the 
weekend crowds were significantly larger than any the Titan basketball team has 
drawn. Its season high is 1,236 for a game against Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Has Fullerton finally found a revenue sport? 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowds speak well for the interest in college baseball," Garrido said. 
"This venue can handle these types of crowds, and with the right teamwork on 
the part of the university and athletic department, this could be happening on 
a regular basis." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To catch a thief: Titan first baseman Adam Millan, one of the team's slower 
players, caught everyone by surprise when he got a huge jump off Georgia Tech 
pitcher Al Gogolin and stole third in the sixth inning Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He shocked the . . . out of me," third base Coach Rick Vanderhook said. "My 
eyes went, 'Whoa!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Millan's heads-up play created a run. He was able to score on a wild pitch 
that made it 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like the basketball coach watching his guy shoot a 40-footer," Horton 
said. "You're going, 'No, no . . . nice shot!' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Iron man: Titan basketball Coach Brad Holland played 108 holes of golf Monday 
at the Yorba Linda Country Club as part of a booster-club event. 
</P>
<P>
 And he was still standing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "My arms are a little stiff and my hands are sore, but I don't have any 
blisters," said Holland, who teed off at 7:30 a.m. and didn't stop until 6 p.m. 
"My clubs were more tired than I was." 
</P>
<P>
 Holland, an avid golfer with a 6-8 handicap, shot 74-76-83-80-81-77. He had 11 
birdies, two triple bogeys and raised about $5,000 for his team. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carolina dreaming: Jeff Maes and Laszlo Molnar became the first wrestlers in 
school history to become four-time NCAA tournament qualifiers with strong 
performances in the Pacific 10 Championships last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Maes placed third in the 126-pound division, and Molnar finished third at 167 
pounds. Ken Workman, unseeded in the 142-pound bracket, upset top-seeded Tony 
Evans of Boise State in the first round and won two more matches before losing 
to Oregon's Cory Sonnen, 5-4, in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 Maes, Molnar and Workman will be joined in Raleigh, N.C., for the March 17-19 
NCAA championships by teammate Dwayne Buth, who placed third at 190 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we surprised a lot of people," Fullerton Coach Ardeshir Asgari said. 
"We also had four NCAA qualifiers last year, which is the second-highest in 
school history. We had seven qualifiers three years ago, but that was when our 
budget was $100,000. Now, it's one-third of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's basketball game between Fullerton and UC Santa Barbara in Titan Gym 
has been moved to 4:30 p.m. to accommodate Prime Ticket, which will televise 
the game. . . . The women's gymnastic team's score of 194.1 in Friday's meet 
against Michigan was the fourth-highest home score in school history. The 
Titans travel to UCLA Friday to face the Bruins and Michigan State in a 
tri-meet. . . . The Fullerton women's fencing team won the Intercollegiate 
Fencing Conference of Southern California title with an 11-1 record, while the 
men finished fifth with a 4-8 mark. Both teams, coached by Heizaburo Okawa, 
will compete in the NCAA Western regionals this weekend at USC. The NCAA 
championships are March 18-22 at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass.

 Basketball is something Johnson does, albeit very well, while waiting for 
softball season. Johnson, a first baseman, already has signed to attend 
Oklahoma on a softball scholarship next fall.Meanwhile, she is passing the time 
as one of the better basketball players around. She helped Cypress to its first 
State tournament berth last week with her contributions in two playoff 
victories. She scored 38 points in two games, including making 15 of 21 shots 
from the field. She scored a season-high 24 points in the victory over Ventura 
on Saturday. Other notables: 
</P>
<P>
 * Kristin Brun, Golden West guard, had 27 rebounds, scored 19 points and had 
13 assists in two playoff victories. 
</P>
<P>
 * Petra Murdoch, Orange Coast, made the game-winning basket in the closing 
seconds as the Pirates beat Chaffey, 66-65, in the playoffs.

 Two years ago, Howard used mostly sophomores and freshmen and suffered through 
a 5-18-1 season. It paid off last season. The Panthers were co-champions with 
Santa Ana Valley and reached the quarterfinals of the Southern Section IV-A 
playoffs. Almost everyone is back, so they are certainly league favorites. 
Archuleta was the league MVP last season. He is a solid hitter and fast. 
Estrada, Mantranga and Maresh were first-team all-league picks. The entire 
infield is back, as is Garza at catcher. The only concerns, and they are 
minimal, are Gonzales and Harris, who are on the basketball team that reached 
the playoffs. They might need time to get ready. Still, there are plenty of 
other arms around.

 The Comanches reached the Division IV-A quarterfinals last season and have a 
good nucleus of players back. Redfox, Valent and Wilson were all-league picks. 
All three are good hitters. The outfield is solid with Wilson and Valent, but 
the infield has some holes to fill. Gutierrez and Wyatt should move from the 
bench to the starting lineup as infielders. Pitching will be the key. Strunz is 
the only one with varsity experience and will have to assume responsibility of 
being the No. 1 starter, at least for now. Jacobs and Patterson are talented, 
but untested. One or both will have to step forward for the Comanches to 
challenge for the league title. Canyon didn't get any favors from the league's 
schedule-makers. The Comanches open against the league favorites, Santa Ana 
Valley and Orange, on the road. They will have to play four consecutive games 
against those two teams after the spring break. There's not much room for 
error.

 A tough team to figure, last year and this season. The Spartans were 
runners-up in the Santa Ana Elks tournament but missed the playoffs by one game 
last season. They have a good nucleus back. Parker and Brady give them two 
solid starters. Brady was a second-team Times Orange County selection as a 
kicker in football. They had better pitch well because they are unlikely to get 
much support. The Spartans need players to develop as hitters, something Wilson 
said hasn't happened yet. The left side of the infield is strong with McMahon, 
the starting quarterback last fall, and Case, who was a first-team all-league 
selection. Halbert was honorable mention all-league, so the Spartans are set at 
catcher. Then come the questions. The outfield spots are up for grabs, except 
for D'Amato. Second base is anyone's guess. There are several good, but 
inexperienced, pitchers if Brady or Parker falter. The best of them is Hansen, 
who worked out of the bullpen last season.

 The Falcons, co-champions a year ago, should make a run at the league title. 
They don't have quite as much returning talent as Orange, but they're close. 
Serrano (5-3, 2.36 ERA) and Crosby (5-6, 3.13) give Santa Ana Valley two 
quality starters. Serrano was a first-team all-league selection and Crosby was 
a second-team pick. Nunez (.324) and Macias (.314) are the team's best 
returning hitters. Ayala, who was injured last season, will be asked to replace 
all-league second baseman Martin Ortega (.523), who graduated. The Falcons have 
good hitters but lack power. The defense is solid in the outfield, where all 
three starters return. The key will be at catcher, where either Martin and 
Chavez come through. All in all, the Falcons have plenty of talent and should 
give Orange a good chase.

 Mott, the son of long-time Vanguard Coach Don Mott, takes over this season. El 
Modena was within a victory of qualifying for the playoffs. The Vanguards 
should be in the running again this year, as they have two experienced 
pitchers. Hanson and May have been on the varsity since they were sophomores. 
Hanson was 6-2 and May 4-5 last season. "We're going to count heavily on those 
two," Mott said. "Our pitching will be strong. It will all depend on how we do 
some of the little things." Such as hit. Gross led the team last season, 
batting better than .400, but most of the young batters will need time to 
develop. Only four seniors were on the varsity last season. "I don't think 
hitting will be a problem," Mott said. "But we're going to have to do things 
like bunt and hit and run. I told our kids, if we're in the game going into the 
seventh inning, we have a chance because of our pitching."

TIME OF RENEWAL IN FIRE-SCARRED LAGUNA; REBUILDING: NEW HOME IS RISING FROM 
ASHES WITH FIRST PERMIT ISSUED UNDER SPEEDED CITY PROCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL and LESLIE EARNEST, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 838 Manzanita Drive, both the physical and symbolic rebuilding of 
fire-ravaged Laguna Beach has begun. 
</P>
<P>
 There, Charles and Louise Benton are determined to put the worst disaster in 
Orange County history behind them. They are the first to obtain a city permit 
to replace the hillside home they lost when a firestorm swept through the 
community on Oct. 27 and claimed 366 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the wood studs of the walls are framed in place and a roof has been 
buttoned on top. 
</P>
<P>
 "I built this home 35 years ago," said 78-year-old Louise Couse Benton, a 
well-known local artist who visits the construction site each day. "I knew I 
could do it again." 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks ahead, many other homeowners will follow the Bentons as the city 
begins to reassemble itself from the wreckage left by the fire. The welcome 
sight of new construction springing up in the neighborhoods, the chorus of 
hammers and saws and the energy of the workers is an important part of the 
healing process still desperately needed in this coastal city of 24,000 people, 
said City Councilman Wayne L. Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to get to the point of putting their lives back together," 
Peterson said. "You can't really do that in a rented apartment somewhere. You 
have to be able to move forward, get the kids back in school, get the old phone 
numbers back and slowly pull everything back into order." 
</P>
<P>
 To help that effort, this city -- notorious for rigid construction standards 
-- has streamlined its building permit process. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the Bentons' permits, three more have been issued so far -- 
including two in county-controlled Emerald Bay. More are expected and, within 
30 days, a dozen more homes should start going up all over the city, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be wonderful to see the new growth," said Susan Sandys, a six-year 
resident. "As it is now, you can still see the scars all over the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Pushed along by hot Santa Ana winds on that infamous afternoon in October, the 
fast-moving flames burned a path of ruin down Laguna Canyon toward the ocean 
and into the Emerald Bay, Canyon Acres and Mystic Hills neighborhoods. Entire 
residential streets, once chockablock with homes, were scorched and the 
structures leveled to their foundations and chimneys. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last four months, while homeowners struggled with the shock of loss 
and negotiated with their insurance agents, the city's energies have been 
dedicated to a cleanup period. The barren hillsides were sandbagged to protect 
against mudslides, and the mounds of rubble and ash have been swept from city 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest chapter in the ongoing story of post-fire Laguna Beach is the 
rebuilding, said Mayor Ann Christoph. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of the cleanup was finished by Christmas," said Christoph, a 
landscape architect. "Then the utility companies came in and made their 
repairs. . . . Now the city can regrow and come back. I think the community 
will be relieved to see people rebuilding their homes and the city come back to 
normal." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bentons, both residents of Laguna Beach since the 1930s, did not set out 
to be pioneers in the rebuilding effort. But Louise Benton was ahead of many 
others because she knew just what she wanted: the same wood-and-glass home 
designed by renowned Laguna Beach architect Chris Abel in 1959 and built by 
local craftsman Jim Schoenleber. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a wonderful home with beautiful views," she said. "We've made a few 
changes, but it will have beautiful, beautiful views again. That was my main 
thought." 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,400-square-foot Manzanita Drive home was actually built by Louise and 
Irven Couse, her first husband. After he died, Louise five years ago married 
Charles Benton, 82, known for the popular Benton's Coffee Shop once located at 
Main Beach, whose own first wife had died. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bentons' application was given a "more or less over-the-counter" approval, 
said Kyle Butterwick, the city's director of community development for the last 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's often agonizing permit process has been temporarily revamped to 
ease homeowners' nerves and get Laguna Beach under construction again, 
Butterwick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a very high priority of the city to expedite the permit process," 
Butterwick said. "As a result, things are moving very quickly now." 
</P>
<P>
 As of last Friday, 50 applications for permits have been submitted to the 
city, including nine in one day -- last Thursday -- Butterwick said. During 
normal times, the city might get three or four permit applications a month, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the streamlined process came strict rebuilding guidelines, 
something Laguna Beach learned from the cities of Oakland and Berkeley, which 
were hit by catastrophic fires in 1992. Those cities moved quickly without 
guidelines and wound up mired in squabbles among neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They encountered some serious neighborhood disagreements on the size and 
scale of the houses and they had to do a midstream re-evaluation of their 
approach," Butterwick said. "We found a key was to provide some parameters on 
what homeowners can and cannot do. . . . So far, things are going pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 The new guidelines are set up to make the process quicker for those, like the 
Bentons, who want to make few changes to their homes, city officials said. The 
new process relies heavily on the reaction from surrounding neighbors who are 
notified of the permit application, Butterwick said. 
</P>
<P>
 A homeowner seeking merely to rebuild an old home can bypass the city's 
five-member Design Review Board, and a permit could be issued in as little as a 
week if no neighbors object, officials said. Those who want to make more 
radical improvements, altering more than 50% of their homes, must go before the 
more rigorous Design Review Board. Over the years, property owners seeking 
extensive variances from city codes have been known to struggle for months 
attempting to win city approval. Once the fire reconstruction ends, Butterwick 
said, the city will resume its former, more stringent permitting process. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the key remaining question is what will come from the rebuilding of 
Laguna Beach, a tourist mecca known for its charm and village atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Emerald Bay, where few homes sell for less than $1 million, will probably 
be affected least while funky Canyon Acres, a mix of beach cottages and art 
studios, might sport a new look altogether by 1995, city officials said. 
</P>

 "I'm very concerned about Canyon Acres," said Councilman Peterson, who has 
discussed that enclave's rebuilding with its leaders. "Canyon Acres will never 
be just like it was before. What's important is that it evolve into where the 
residents are today, not where they were 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Butterwick said one of the goals of the city staff is to help the 
neighborhoods re-establish their identities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to say you would not witness a noticeable change," Butterwick 
said. "We certainly don't want to see the neighborhoods overbuilt or changed to 
a repetitious architectural style. Neighborhoods here are eclectic and 
diversified in their appearance and that is in the interests of everybody, to 
re-create that diversity." 
</P>
<P>
 * ADDED PROTECTION: Orange County will obtain a firefighting helicopter. B4 
Streamlined Permit Process 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach homeowners burned out by last fall's fires can apply for building 
permits using an accelerated process created just for them. A recently adopted 
rebuilding policy for fire survivors cuts much of the red tape for regular 
building permits. Some of the provisions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Those who rebuild from original blueprints and add no more than 10% in size 
do not have to submit to a design review. Approval is usually granted within a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 * Expansion of more than 10% and less than 50% does not require design review 
unless neighbors complain about changes. City planning staff tries to settle 
controversy. If successful, permit is approved without design review; if not, 
review is conducted only for portion of blueprint in question. 
</P>
<P>
 * Additions of 50% or more to original blueprints are sent to the top of the 
agenda for design review. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city has: 
</P>
<P>
 * Published a detailed explanation of the permit process. 
</P>
<P>
 * Added a zoning plan and a structural plan checker to handle permit 
applications.

HOUSTON WINS THREE TOP GRAMMY AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 And the winner again . . . Whitney Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the scene may have shifted from the American Music Awards last month 
in Los Angeles to the Grammy Awards here on Tuesday night, the result was the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston, whose success with the massive hit "I Will Always Love You" earned 
her an armful of awards in the fan-based American Music Awards, walked away 
with three more major Grammys. They included record and album of the year, as 
voted by 7,000 members of the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, the nationally televised event from Radio City Music Hall seemed 
like a Houston TV special. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a white sequined evening gown, she opened the program by singing "I 
Will Always Love You," the song from the soundtrack album "The Bodyguard," 
which has sold more than 25 million copies worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Dolly Parton, who wrote the tune in the early 1970s, and David 
Foster, who produced Houston's hit version of it, stepped to the podium to 
announce the award for best female pop vocal. 
</P>
<P>
 "On behalf of myself and the Internal Revenue Service, I'd like to thank 
Whitney for making my song such an enormous hit," Parton said. "When I wrote 
that song 22 years ago, I had a heartache. But it's amazing how healing money 
can be." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty minutes after accepting that award, Houston returned to the podium to 
accept the record of the year Grammy for the same recording. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to thank everybody who bought the record, who loved it" she said. "God 
bless you. Peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone else Tuesday seemed like part of the supporting cast -- even producer 
and arranger Foster, who won four awards largely for his work with Houston, and 
composer Alan Menken, who won four awards for music associated with another 
soundtrack, for the animated movie "Aladdin." 
</P>
<P>
 But the real co-star was Frank Sinatra, whose appearance for a Grammy Legends 
award resulted in the evening's biggest embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 After a poignant introduction by U2's lead singer Bono, Sinatra was well into 
a long, casual speech when he was suddenly interrupted by an announcement of 
other Grammy winners. Telecast host Garry Shandling said later, "Mr. Sinatra 
should have (been allowed to finish) his speech." 
</P>
<P>
 Houston's only loss during the three-hour ceremony was in the female R & B 
vocal category, which was won by Toni Braxton, who was also named best new 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster's awards pushed his Grammy total to 12, while Menken's career total 
soared to nine. His latest included best song and best song for a motion 
picture -- "A Whole New World," co-written by Tim Rice. Peabo Bryson and Regina 
Belle's recording of "A Whole New World" was also voted best pop vocal by a 
duo. Quincy Jones, the all-time non-classical Grammy leader, won his 26th for a 
collaboration with the late Miles Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Other multiple winners included Sting, who was honored for male pop vocal and 
long-form video, and saxophonist Joe Henderson, for jazz instrumental solo and 
jazz instrumental by an individual or group. "The Complete Billie Holiday on 
Verve 1945-1959" earned three awards, including best album notes, recording 
package and historical album. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Bennett scored perhaps the evening's biggest upset when he defeated the 
highly favored Barbra Streisand in the traditional pop vocal category. Bruce 
Hornsby and Branford Marsalis took the best pop instrumental performance title. 
</P>
<P>
 U2's "Zooropa" was named best alternative album, while Meat Loaf captured best 
rock vocal with his comeback hit "I'd Do Anything for Love (but I Won't Do 
That)". Aerosmith won in the rock group voting, while the Stone Temple Pilots 
upset the more critically admired Smashing Pumpkins in the hard rock category. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran Ozzy Osbourne was cited in the metal competition. 
</P>
<P>
 In classical categories, the much-awarded Chicago Symphony, under two guest 
conductors, took, or was associated with, top Grammys in five areas.

AMENDMENT TO BALANCE BUDGET FAILS IN SENATE; DEFICIT: MEASURE LACKS 4 VOTES OF 
TWO-THIRDS NEEDED. HOUSE SEEN PASSING CONTROVERSIAL PROPOSAL IN GESTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With President Clinton leading the opposition, the Senate narrowly defeated a 
constitutional amendment Tuesday designed to balance the federal budget within 
seven years. Advocates of the politically and economically explosive proposal 
fell four votes short of the required two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate split, 63 to 37, in favor of an amendment sponsored by Sen. Paul 
Simon (D-Ill.), but supporters needed 67 votes to prevail in the latest 
showdown of a long-running Capitol Hill issue. 
</P>
<P>
 California's Democratic senators were on opposite sides, with Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein voting for the amendment and Sen. Barbara Boxer voting against it. 
</P>
<P>
 Only hours before the key roll call, Clinton called the amendment a "recipe 
for total paralysis" and warned that it would endanger the economic recovery. 
Simon's amendment would have forbidden deficit spending after the year 2001 
unless three-fifths of the House and Senate approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) countered: "The balanced-budget 
amendment may not be perfect but, absent political courage, it may be the only 
way we will ever eliminate the federal deficit." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the proposal promised to keep up the fight. As Simon put it: 
"This isn't going to die. The deficit will keep piling up." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-four Democrats and three Republicans combined to block passage of the 
Simon amendment. Forty-one Republicans and 22 Democrats voted for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not through," said Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), a principal sponsor. 
"We're going to continue until we get it passed." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Taxpayers' Union, a leading advocate of the Simon amendment, 
termed the outcome "a temporary triumph" and NTU Chairman James Davidson added: 
"This issue will not die, and the House of Representatives can give the 
amendment new momentum when it comes to a vote there this month." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the House is expected to approve a balanced-budget amendment, the 
measure appears to be dead at least for this session of Congress. The 
Constitution can be amended by a two-thirds vote by both the Senate and House 
and ratification by 38 states. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate aides said it is unlikely that the Senate will vote again this year on 
the issue, which has divided liberal and conservative lawmakers of both parties 
for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate passed such an amendment in 1982, but the House did not act. In 
1986, the Senate fell one vote short of approving a similar proposal, and the 
House came within nine votes of passing a balanced-budget measure in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Familiar arguments were made during this year's weeklong debate. Proponents of 
the amendment said that Congress would never develop the discipline to check 
perennial red-ink spending without a constitutional mandate. Opponents 
contended that the proposal is a gimmick that would prove unworkable and would 
be unnecessary if lawmakers made tough choices to reduce spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike in previous years, however, Tuesday's Senate vote came at a time when 
the nation's red-ink crisis finally appears to be on the wane. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest Clinton Administration forecasts show the deficit declining next 
year to $176 billion, down from a peak of $290 billion in 1992. Responsible is 
a combination of an improving economy, which is generating increasing tax 
revenues, and the package of tax hikes and spending cuts enacted by Congress 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office likewise has forecast a steadily 
declining deficit and reported that the crisis is effectively over for the 
remainder of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, Clinton strongly 
opposed the balanced-budget proposal. In the Senate, Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.) and Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) 
orchestrated the opposition, while Simon joined with a large group of 
conservatives to support the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 In his concluding remarks, Mitchell accused the proponents of "political 
posturing" that would avoid tough budget-cutting decisions while appearing to 
favor them. "It would be an abdication of our responsibility to succumb to the 
temptation to cast the easy vote for this proposal," Mitchell said. "It's a 
gimmick, a very transparent gimmick." 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy that apparently blocked adoption of the amendment involved the 
introduction of an alternative sponsored by Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) that would 
exempt Social Security and capital investments from the budget-balancing 
requirements and allowed for their suspension in times of recession. 
</P>
<P>
 While opponents contended that Reid's proposal was a sham too weak to restrain 
deficit spending, proponents argued that it would prevent budget-balancing at 
the expense of senior citizens and provide needed flexibility in government 
outlays during recessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Reid's plan was defeated 78 to 22, falling 45 votes short of the required 
two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Although only 22 senators sided with Reid, they included several who later 
opposed the Simon version, providing the essential votes to block its adoption. 
Opponents said that these senators could now tell constituents that they voted 
for a balanced-budget amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 22 supporters were six Democrats and four Republicans who will stand 
for reelection this fall, including Feinstein. Boxer also voted for Reid's 
version of the amendment.

MUSLIMS, CROATS OK BOSNIA UNION; BALKANS: CHRISTOPHER SAYS THE U.S.-BROKERED 
ACCORD 'SHOWS THAT PEACE IS POSSIBLE.' OFFICIALS HOPE THE PACT WILL PUT 
PRESSURE ON SERBS TO REACH A SETTLEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Bosnian government and Croatian separatists, two of the parties in a 
three-sided war, signed a peace agreement Tuesday to form a federated state -- 
a move hailed by U.S. officials as a significant step toward ending two years 
of bloodshed in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement "shows that peace is possible," Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher declared after witnessing the pact's signing at a ceremony here. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord came after three weeks of intensive negotiations, which culminated 
in four days of U.S.-mediated talks here among representatives of the 
predominantly Muslim Bosnian government, Bosnian Croats and Croatia -- Bosnia's 
neighbor, which has armed and supported Bosnian Croat rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the hopeful language, the agreement is far from an end to the war. 
Most significantly, it leaves out Serbian separatists who control about 70% of 
Bosnian territory, including large swaths that the new federation would claim 
as its own. But American and European officials hope the agreement will add to 
pressure on the Serbs to reach a settlement that would involve giving up some 
of the territory they have seized. 
</P>
<P>
 The Croats and the Bosnian government also must still work out numerous 
details of their new federation in talks expected to begin Friday in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, although U.S. officials insisted that the men who negotiated the 
agreement -- primarily Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Croatian 
Foreign Minister Mate Granic -- acted in good faith, they conceded that neither 
fully controls the forces on his own side. Extreme elements among the Croatian 
and Muslim populations have torpedoed earlier agreements between the two 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, the two groups would form a federation made up of 
several cantons, some of which would be predominantly Muslim, some 
predominantly Croatian and others mixed. That new federated state would cover 
just over half the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- leaving the rest in 
Serbian hands. In theory, Bosnian Serbs could join the new federation as a 
third party, although neither American officials nor other observers expect 
that would happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a second agreement, signed simultaneously, the new federation would form 
a loose economic union with Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 After two years of war that has involved thousands of atrocities and cost 
roughly 250,000 missing and dead -- mostly Muslim civilians -- the federation 
idea holds some benefits for each side that earlier peace plans did not. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Bosnian government, a chief benefit would be territorial. By linking 
the Bosnian government's lands with those held by Croats, the new federation 
would be far more economically and politically viable than the remnant of 
territory the government seemed likely to control under earlier peace plans, 
which would have divided Bosnia into three ethnic states. The agreement also 
commits Croatia to guarantee Bosnian access to the Adriatic Sea -- an 
economically vital point. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that you have these two units together helps a lot" in making the 
resulting federation economically viable, said a senior Clinton Administration 
official who assisted in the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 By setting up a binational federation, the agreement would maintain -- at 
least in theory -- the idea of a Bosnian state not based solely on ethnicity. 
That idea has been of great importance to some Bosnian government loyalists, 
who are mostly Muslim but include some Serbs and Croats. 
</P>
<P>
 For Croatia, the chief selling point has been a chance to regain the graces of 
the United States and its European allies. Large chunks of Croatian territory 
remain under Serbian occupation as a result of earlier warfare. Granic made 
clear that his country now expects Western help in the "peaceful integration" 
of those territories back into Croatian control. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last three weeks, "it started to sink in that this was a real 
opportunity for Croatia to become a real partner with the United States and 
Europe," the senior Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's action Monday in downing four Bosnian 
Serb warplanes violating a "no-fly" zone over Bosnia also may have sent a 
message to Croatian extremists, as well as to the Zagreb government supporting 
them, that there is a price to be paid for destabilizing and renegade actions. 
Croatia had been threatened with the same harsh international sanctions levied 
against Serbia if it persisted in supporting Croatian nationalist rebels in 
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, for the Administration the agreement caps a decision made last 
month to inject the United States directly into the Bosnian war for the first 
time as the sole mediator in negotiations. The result has staked the 
Administration's prestige more directly than ever before on a successful 
outcome. "We have acquired a kind of moral obligation," former White House 
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft said. "A year ago . . . we were hands 
off. Now we're no longer hands off." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the potential reasons for all sides to make the agreement work, 
previous accords and cease-fires signed by moderates in the Bosnian war have 
proven short-lived because radical military commanders have refused to abide by 
them. American officials conceded the same fate could befall the current 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Emotions run high in central Bosnia, where Muslim-Croatian relations have been 
poisoned by the past year of violence, provoked by Western capitulation to the 
concept of ethnic partitioning. 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions are particularly sharp in the central Bosnian city of Vitez, where 
radical Croatian forces, instigated by nationalists from the Herzegovina 
region, committed atrocities against Muslim civilians; this has drawn in 
equally violent, unscrupulous Islamic warriors who have come to fight their own 
holy war in hopes of securing a fundamentalist foothold in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Silajdzic and Granic represent the moderate factions in their respective 
republics, but their word and signatures on peace accords hold little sway with 
radical elements. 
</P>
<P>
 But there have been signs in recent weeks that the Croatian leadership in 
Zagreb is distancing itself from the more extreme elements of the Bosnian Croat 
community, such as former rebel leader Mate Boban, who has been swept aside by 
another Zagreb surrogate. 
</P>
<P>
 Boban, a small-town businessman through whom Croatian radicals have funneled 
millions of dollars in weapons with the aim of forcibly expanding the state of 
Croatia, had instigated much of the fighting in central Bosnia by loosing 
Croatian radical forces against Muslim civilians in a terror campaign aimed at 
forcing them to flee. 
</P>
<P>
 He was removed from his post as self-proclaimed president of the purported 
rebel state of Herzeg-Bosna last month and replaced with Kresimir Zubak, a move 
thought to be aimed at convincing the West that Croatia has abandoned a 
nationalist course. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Croatia has struck an official pose of neutrality in the Bosnian 
conflict, U.N. military observers have confirmed that at least 5,000 regular 
Croatian army troops have been fighting in Bosnia, and many more nationalist 
volunteers are estimated to be backing Bosnian Croat forces. Under Tuesday's 
agreement, Croatia will withdraw its troops from Bosnian territory.

DRIVERS FIND QUAKE'S SILVER LINING: A SHORTER COMMUTE; TRAFFIC: ABOUT 200,000 
MOTORISTS HAVE TIME TO ENJOY A SECOND CUP OF COFFEE. BUT THEY ARE CAREFUL NOT 
TO RUB IT IN.

<P>
 The Northridge earthquake has spawned a new, surprisingly large breed of 
commuters: people whose rides have been made faster, not slower, by freeway 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the quake has adversely affected the daily commutes of about 1 
million motorists, it has improved the drive for about 200,000 others, 
according to a Caltrans estimate made at The Times' request. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussing commutes has long been the hallmark of true Angelenos. But these 
days some of the luckier motorists slink into their offices, quickly drink 
their coffee and avoid eye contact; rather than talk about their drives, they 
sometimes open the morning paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "My commute is wonderful. I hate to say that because there are people in my 
office who take three hours to get home," said Pattie McCann, 28, an insurance 
company marketing specialist from Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The opportunities that people such as McCann are enjoying have been created by 
several factors. For one thing, since the earthquake about 10% fewer drivers 
are using the freeways, according to Steve Leung, chief of Caltrans' traffic 
management branch. Officials say the reduction has occurred because employers 
are offering more flexible hours, people are trying car-pools and mass transit, 
and drivers are avoiding freeways for anything but essential trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Quake damage on freeways has created new pockets of clear sailing and 
different patterns of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the kind of surprise Jerry Munson has come to relish. 
</P>
<P>
 Munson, 39, of Sylmar, dreaded his first commute after the earthquake. For 
three days, as he cleared the fallen cinder blocks and swept up the broken 
crystal, he would step outside and see cars inching along the crippled Golden 
State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it was Munson's turn to go to work. He figured he would be swallowed 
up in the steady, unmoving train of cars as he braved the 27-mile trip to his 
Downtown Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
 But Munson's drive was a mere 38 minutes -- almost half the usual. It turned 
out he was entering the Golden State Freeway just past the choke point he had 
been seeing, where thousands were -- and continue to be -- delayed by the 
downed interchange between the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "My worst nightmare didn't come to pass," said Munson, 39, a credit manager 
with an international credit card company. "It was actually very easy, almost a 
leisurely drive. I felt so elated." 
</P>
<P>
 Not the sentiments you want to share with a colleague who has been grinding 
his teeth and quaffing black coffee during an early morning odyssey along back 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the commute improved because of car-pool lanes that Caltrans 
installed to help the crippled freeways accommodate more people. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the earthquake, Sue Himmelrich and her husband used to frequently 
drive together from Santa Monica on the Santa Monica Freeway to their 
respective Downtown offices. Because there was no car-pool lane, the only 
advantage was having time together. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, with a temporary car-pool lane set up on the freeway, Himmelrich's 
drive is about 10 minutes shorter than before -- or 25 minutes door to door. 
When the couple drive west in the car-pool lane, they are only off the freeway 
for about one block. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten minutes is a significant savings, percentage-wise," said Himmelrich, an 
attorney. "Generally, the freeway gets very backed up. The car-pool people just 
fly by the others." 
</P>
<P>
 For Constance Russell, the commute has become not merely faster but more 
civilized. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell, 47, does the driving in a van-pool that she and co-workers created 
three years ago. They commute from Palmdale to their Wilshire Boulevard office. 
Until the earthquake struck, navigating the lumbering van into car-pool lanes 
had been agonizing. Cars would zip by, refusing to slow and allow the van into 
the faster multi-passenger lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Russell said, car-pool-lane drivers, enjoying an "elegance of time" 
compared to other commuters, seem far more obliging. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the earthquake, among the people who normally would kill you before 
they let you in, there was a new etiquette," Russell said. "Cars now let us in 
to the diamond lane -- there is a courtesy extended." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Jalipo's typical 35-minute commute from east Simi Valley to Warner 
Center in Woodland Hills has been reduced to 20 minutes. For three years, 
Jalipo has driven on the Simi Valley Freeway and headed south on Topanga Canyon 
Boulevard. But when the quake snapped the Simi Valley Freeway at Reseda 
Boulevard, motorists traveling west were cut off from Topanga Canyon Boulevard, 
and that crowded surface street became easier to drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, Jalipo, a 35-year-old medical reviewer for an insurance company, 
could sleep 15 minutes later. Her weekday drive "seemed more like holidays. It 
was kind of eerie, the people were gone," she said. "I don't have to worry 
about busting out the door, eating my toast and drinking my coffee while I'm 
driving. It's great." 
</P>
<P>
 Among some whose commute has improved, "there's a sense of 'How come my life 
is better than usual or not as affected as others I know?' " said Dr. Lilli 
Friedland, a member of the Los Angeles County Psychological Assn.'s disaster 
response team. "Some people do, in fact, translate this into: 'God must have 
loved me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The more appropriate response, Friedland said, is "not to feel favored but to 
know that it's really luck and to feel good about it." 
</P>
<P>
 For McCann, an improved commute was one of the great anomalies of the 
earthquake that all but destroyed her kitchen, including the glass collection 
that she had begun as a child. It seemed as if she and her colleagues had 
endured the earthquake together, all suffering damage in their homes. But there 
was one key difference: While their commutes worsened, hers improved. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, no one talked about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all felt the earthquake and all the aftershocks," McCann said. "It just 
seemed odd that my drive would be easier than the people I work with." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, McCann's colleagues, teasing her about her commute, call her spoiled. 
She counters that Simi Valley -- the butt of much derision after the 1992 trial 
involving police officers accused of beating motorist Rodney G. King -- is not 
such a bad place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 The reduction in her round-trip commute -- cut to about 40 minutes from 70 -- 
has brightened her life. Now she gets home in time to kick off her heels and 
watch TV before her water aerobics classes. Instead of eating fast food, she 
cooks dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't dread getting into my car to get home anymore," she said.

ACCORD CALLS FOR CITIES TO HELP PAY LANDFILL CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE and RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unusual case that pits a host of blue-chip corporations against 14 
cities in Los Angeles County, the municipalities have tentatively agreed to 
contribute about $31 million to the cleanup of a Monterey Park landfill once 
considered one of the most toxic dumps in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement would climax a four-year legal battle between the corporations 
and 29 suburban cities over who was going to pay for the cleanup of the 
Operating Industries landfill. The landfill, with its 300-foot-high mountain of 
waste, was closed in 1984 and was placed on the federal Environmental 
Protection Agency's list of Superfund sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 14 cities, councils in Monterey Park, Alhambra, Rosemead, Cudahy, 
Montebello, South Gate, Maywood and Lynwood have agreed to the settlement. 
Councils in Temple City, South Pasadena and City of Commerce have yet to take 
action. Officials in Compton, San Gabriel and Bell could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the cities' governing bodies, the money would be used to help 
finance cleanup efforts at the 190-acre dump where contaminants include such 
cancer-causing substances as vinyl chloride and trichloroethylene. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the proposed settlement, several private waste hauling firms would 
also pay $10.4 million. In addition, Los Angeles County and two sanitation 
districts in Mesa Heights and Walnut Park have tentatively agreed to pay 
$62,400. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimates of the cleanup costs have ranged from $500 million to $650 million. 
</P>
<P>
 After the EPA sought to collect the money from a number of companies it 
accused of dumping millions of gallons of toxic materials, the companies tried 
to force the cities to pick up a share of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 After agreeing to spend more than $200 million to help remedy problems at the 
dump, about 65 companies, including General Motors, Mobil, Exxon and 
Georgia-Pacific, sued the municipalities, arguing that they too were 
responsible for the pollution. Five of the 29 cities were dropped from the 
suit. Ten agreed to pay about $2 million in a partial settlement in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining 14 cities contended that the suit was an attempt by corporate 
polluters to shift the cost of the cleanup to taxpayers. The cities argued that 
the household trash they contributed to the dump was not in the same category 
as the toxic waste deposited by industrial giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are saying the dirty diapers we threw away for years are as toxic as the 
hazardous liquids they dumped there for years," Pat West, deputy city manager 
of Paramount, said when his city earlier agreed to join the settlement. But 
late last year in a key ruling in the case, U.S. District Judge William M. 
Byrne Jr. declared that the cities could be found liable for cleanup costs, 
said Timothy Gallagher, one of several lawyers who has been representing the 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 That was enough to prompt his clients to try to reach a settlement, Gallagher 
said. "From that point on, the only issue left to be resolved was to establish 
how much each settling party allegedly disposed of at the site." Gallagher 
pointed out that the EPA has estimated that the cleanup could cost $650 million 
and that the corporate plaintiffs were seeking $312 million in their lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the cities are ecstatic because we were able to settle the case for 
about $30 million when the potential liability was so much larger," Gallagher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed settlement is the largest resolution of a Superfund dispute in 
which the EPA was not directly involved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher said insurance firms had agreed to pay a substantial share of the 
settlement, although he would not say how much. He also said that the cities 
would be able to pay the balance of the contributions from their insurance 
reserve funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is most important about this case is the money is actually going to the 
cleanup of the landfill," Gallagher said. "Usually, the money ends up being 
spent on litigation fees." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher said that each of the waste haulers, cities and agencies listed in 
the agreement must approve it before it is final. He emphasized that the 
settlement was not an admission of guilt by the cities. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials explained why they had not attempted to collect from the cities. 
</P>
<P>
 They said a 1989 agency policy on Superfund sites holds that EPA will not go 
after municipalities unless their waste can be proved to have contained 
hazardous substances from an industrial process. That policy applies to trash 
haulers as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we have no evidence these cities sent hazardous waste there," said 
Katherine Shine, an EPA attorney assigned to the landfill case. "And this is a 
site where we do have information on 4,000 waste generators. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have good evidence (the industries cited by the EPA) sent a lot of stuff 
to the site," she said. "Some individual companies sent millions of gallons of 
hazardous waste to this landfill. At the top was Chevron, with 15 million 
gallons of various industrial wastes." 
</P>
<P>
 But a lawyer for the companies said: "If there hadn't been ample evidence that 
the cities dumped hazardous waste, the judge would never have ruled as he did," 
referring to Byrne's ruling that the cities were potentially liable. The 
Superfund law allows polluters identified by the EPA to try to broaden 
responsibility for cleanup costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities had "no choice but to settle," said Monterey Park Mayor Marie 
Purvis, whose city has agreed to pay $4.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our city is responsible for a very small percentage of the hazardous waste in 
the landfill compared to the big conglomerates who put mounds of the stuff in 
there," Purvis said. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate City Manager Todd Agnow said his city had already spent nearly as 
much in legal fees as the estimated $700,000 it will have to pay for its share 
of the settlement after its insurer provides its portion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alhambra City Council has agreed to provide $8.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our insurance companies are going to pay all but $2 million," said Mayor 
Barbara Messina. "This goes back a long way, to when cities dumped garbage at 
the landfill. It was a time when no one dreamed household waste would be ranked 
as hazardous waste." 
</P>
<P>
 Times environmental writer Frank Clifford contributed to this story. Cleanup 
Costs 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen cities in Los Angeles County have reached a tentative agreement with 
several corporations to pay about $32 million to help clean up the Operating 
Industries landfill in Monterey Park. Under the agreement, the cities would pay 
approximately these amounts: Alhambra: $8.5 million Bell: $415,000 Commerce: 
$395,000 Compton: $2.5 million Cudahy: $350,000 Lynwood: $1.6 million Maywood: 
$550,000 Montebello: $4.8 million Monterey Park: $4.6 million Rosemead: 
$947,000 San Gabriel: $2 million South Gate: $2.2 million South Pasadena: 
$641,000 Temple City: $1.9 million

ECONOMY GREW AT TORRID 7.5% PACE IN LATE '93 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. economy rocketed forward at a feverish 7.5% rate in late 1993, the 
most heated performance in nearly 10 years, the government said Tuesday, 
stirring new inflation fears and sending the stock and bond markets into a 
tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
 The surge in gross domestic product, a sweeping gauge of U.S. economic 
activity, was even greater than the 5.9% rate that had been estimated initially 
for the October-December quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Few economists expect -- or want -- the 7.5% growth to be maintained. That 
kind of pace would overburden factories, prompt labor shortages and risk a 
major outbreak of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors were also rattled by another report by corporate purchasing 
executives that documented signs of emerging inflation faced by a broad array 
of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Federal Reserve and bond market aren't just worried about what inflation 
is today," said Hugh A. Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany 
brokerage firm. "They're worried about what it may become." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day with a 22.79-point loss after 
plunging as much as 40 points on expectations that the Federal Reserve will 
soon hike interest rates. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond, a barometer 
of long-term inflation trends, surged to the highest level in more than eight 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll see a rise in interest rates in the next several weeks," 
predicted Richard B. Hoey, a portfolio manager and chief economist at the 
Dreyfus Corp. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a move would be the second of the year, reflecting a sea change in 
economic policy which, until recently, was designed to keep a fragile recovery 
alive -- not prevent it from overexertion. The Fed raised the key federal funds 
rate to 3.25% from 3% on Feb. 4, in what officials described as a preemptive 
attack on inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts Tuesday struggled to make sense of a large new batch of economic 
data, which also contained sketchy evidence that the economy had slowed in 
recent weeks and that inflation was subdued through 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of existing homes fell 3% in January, the National Assn. of Realtors 
reported. The group cited harsh winter weather and rising mortgage rates as 
reasons for the decline. (In California, the pace of home sales fell 4.1% from 
December but remained 20.2% higher than in January, 1993.) 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton and White House officials portrayed the economy as vigorous 
and stable, despite rising inflation jitters in financial markets throughout 
the world. By one Commerce Department measure, U.S. inflation rose at a scant 
1.3% rate for the last three months of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am encouraged by the growth figures and by the fact that all the indicators 
are (showing) there's no significant increase in inflation," Clinton told 
reporters. "It's good to have that." 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-quarter growth figures heartened some observers because they showed 
burgeoning U.S. exports along with continuing strength in business investment, 
consumer spending and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 For 1993 overall, the U.S. economy grew at a 3% pace, the latest estimates 
show. That is the highest level of growth since 1988, when the economy expanded 
3.9%, according to the Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest evidence suggests growth will ease into the 3% range this year, 
economists said Tuesday. Modest income gains, the lackluster jobs market, the 
earthquake and severe winter weather all are speed bumps on the expansion's 
path. Moreover, a 3% rate would be expected to generate less inflation than the 
sizzling pace of late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "While it's hard to imagine how the economy can maintain this torrid pace 
through 1994, it's clear that the year is starting off with some very strong 
and well-balanced momentum," said Martin A. Regalia, chief economist of the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news wasn't clear in the financial markets, which have been on a 
hair-trigger for signs of inflation since early last month, when Federal 
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan announced the likelihood of interest rate 
hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising interest rates erode the value of bonds and increase borrowing costs 
for business, which can hurt corporate stocks, as well. They also push up bond 
yields, attracting some money that otherwise would have gone into the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors Tuesday were particularly alarmed by the National Assn. of 
Purchasing Management's monthly survey of more than 300 industrial 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the fourth-quarter growth report, which was a snapshot of the economy's 
recent past, the purchasing manager's survey offers a possible glimpse into the 
future. Its message: New inflationary pressures are quietly working their way 
into the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, 58.8% of purchasing executives reported bottlenecks or slower 
deliveries of products in February, up from 55% in January and 51.7% in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, 67% said they had encountered rising prices, up from 59.8% in 
January and 51.3% in December. The purchasing managers said prices overall had 
hit the highest level since October, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are big jumps -- back-to-back increases which will frighten bond buyers 
and deeply concern the Federal Reserve Board," said First Albany's Johnson, 
referring to the price hikes and bottlenecks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chances are high that the Fed will raise interest rates sooner rather 
than later." 
</P>
<P>
 While some analysts blamed winter weather and the earthquake for supply 
disruptions that affected the purchasing statistics, there was also a sense 
that a further interest rate hike is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some said that higher rates are just the medicine needed to keep 
inflation from gradually running out of control in the buoyant national 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inflation is not rising in a big way," said Douglas J. Schindewolf, a money 
market economist at the Smith Barney Shearson investment firm. "But if the Fed 
were to sit back and just let the economy run, then we'd have legitimate 
inflation problems down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreyfus' Hoey predicted that the Fed "will drop the other shoe quickly," 
adding an additional one-quarter point to interest rates, further shutting the 
door on the recent era of sliding interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, after the Fed hiked the fed funds rate for the first time in 
nearly five years, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Parry 
declared: "It's unlikely that one step is going to be enough."

ARAFAT, PEACE PLAN TARGETS OF FURY AMONG PALESTINIANS; MIDEAST: CONSTITUENTS 
SAY PLO CHIEF LEFT DOOR OPEN FOR MASSACRE. AND PEACE PROCESS HAS LOST 
CREDIBILITY, HE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan. But in the whitewashed villas 
that are the Palestine Liberation Organization's headquarters in exile, there 
is little fasting going on. 
</P>
<P>
 The chain-smoking starts at noon and carries on until dawn. Coffee cups stand 
in wet rings amid scattered ashes on PLO executives' desktops. Here and there, 
the furtive bottle of Scotch finds its way onto the table by midafternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 These are hard times, maybe too hard for religion. PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat 
is keeping the prescribed dawn-to-dusk fast and makes the regulation five 
prayers a day. 
</P>
<P>
 But sitting in his office beneath a huge mural of the golden dome of 
Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque, he looks drawn and distant. With the Prophet 
Mohammed's path to heaven depicted in bright color behind him, and his aides in 
respectful reverence seated around him, he seems very much alone. 
</P>
<P>
 After last week's massacre of 48 Palestinians at a Hebron mosque, the PLO 
leader -- who has banked his future on peace with Israel -- has found the door, 
once again, slammed shut. Trying for years to run a revolution by fax and 
speaker phone from across the Mediterranean Sea, Arafat finds himself at a new 
deadlock with Israel only weeks before he could have concluded a peace 
agreement and planned his triumphal return to Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Palestinians throughout the occupied territories, Lebanon and Jordan are 
ripping down his photographs, burning effigies of his trademark fatigues and 
checkered scarf, blaming him for the peace plan they say left the door open to 
a Jewish settler's murderous fury. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the world will hold him accountable if he doesn't go back to the 
peace talks with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 And Arafat, the blustery guerrilla leader who has been the single constant of 
the Palestinian revolution, grows quiet when he is asked if he can carry his 
people with him if he goes back to the peace table now. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he says softly. "To speak frankly, no. And you know why. Because the 
peace process has lost its credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to understand their feeling. Furious," Arafat says, sitting at his 
desk at 2 a.m. after an emergency meeting of the PLO Executive Committee to 
find a way out of the crisis. "I promised them that there is peace, and what 
was the result? Massacre. . . . These are my people, and I am responsible for 
every one, every family, every victim, every injured person. And every person 
is asking now, 'If this is peace, is this the price of peace?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Tunis, the attack that killed 48 worshipers during a holy Friday of 
Ramadan has led to a sea change in attitudes toward the Declaration of 
Principles signed with Israel in September, a rising tide of doubt about 
whether the agreement will ever be carried out -- or whether it ever should. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat and his top lieutenants are struggling to gain enough face-saving 
concessions from Israel on controlling Jewish settlements to allow them to 
resume negotiations. But even some PLO leaders who initially supported the 
agreement -- they were a bare majority -- are having second thoughts now. Many 
are demanding sweeping new negotiations that would abandon the idea of 
Palestinian self-rule "first" in Jericho and the Gaza Strip and put issues like 
Palestinian statehood, an end to Jewish settlements and the status of Jerusalem 
immediately on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no more two stages of a settlement. There will be one stage: 
dismantling settlements, ending occupation, normalizing relations," said Bassam 
abu Sharif, a longtime Arafat political adviser. "Condemnation, apology, sorrow 
means nothing. It means nothing. What means something concrete is a serious 
step toward peace . . . and dismantling the settlements built illegally is an 
indispensable step." 
</P>
<P>
 Jawid Hussein, a PLO Executive Committee member who supported Arafat on peace 
with Israel, said it is time for the organization to abandon minor talks and 
start discussing a complete Israeli pullout from the occupied West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a two-year delay under the (current plan) for discussing the final 
status" of the occupied territories, Hussein said. "This massacre is another 
proof that as long as you have occupation, you are going to have violence. 
There is practically a consensus among the Executive Committee of the PLO that 
we should really look toward a comprehensive and just peace and move as soon as 
possible toward it. Because of the delay in applying the withdrawal, we are 
giving way to the extremists to have the upper hand." 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is the PLO's fear that, locked away in Tunis from the 1.2 million 
Palestinians in the occupied territories and the millions more in exile abroad, 
the organization has lost the momentum toward peace and faces the prospect of 
signing an agreement that lacks popular backing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Palestinian people at the beginning of this, by an overwhelming majority, 
supported the peace process," said Yasser Abed-Rabbo, PLO information 
department chief. "Now the overwhelming majority of the Palestinian people, the 
same majority, is taking a position refusing the resumption of talks and 
negotiations unless there are guarantees to protect the lives of Palestinians." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel's offers to crack down only on extremist settlers, a move regarded as 
largely cosmetic here, have left the PLO unwilling to go back to the revolution 
but unable to proceed with peace. "We don't want to kill the peace process," 
Abed-Rabbo said. "But we don't want the peace process to kill us." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the PLO headquarters here, there is deep frustration in the delay 
in implementing the Declaration of Principles, under which the Israeli army was 
to begin withdrawing from Jericho and Gaza on Dec. 13. Instead, negotiators got 
bogged down in details over how large the Jericho district would be, whether 
Palestinian guards would stand at the border crossings and whether Palestinian 
cars could lead joint security patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmed Suleiman Khoury (also known as Abu Alaa), who headed the secret talks in 
Norway that produced the September agreement, said the negotiations went astray 
when they fixated on details rather than a frank, faithful assumption that both 
sides would act in good faith and that details would take care of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he said, April 13 -- the day when the Israeli army is to have completed 
its withdrawal -- looms dangerously, and even he, one of the strongest 
proponents of the peace accord, worries about its future. "If the 13th of April 
comes without a withdrawal, I have my doubts the agreement will fly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hebron massacre came as a devastating blow to those closest to the 
negotiations, precisely because they were so close to concluding an accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days before the incident, PLO sources said, negotiators had reached 
agreement that Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin would sign a 
final accord in Cairo on March 10, with the Israeli withdrawal to commence on 
March 13 and be complete by April 13. A team of PLO officials was to have 
parachuted into Gaza and Jericho to start working out details of the transition 
this past Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Now all of that is on hold. And for Arafat, this week's new standoff has been 
a battle of nerves that aides say the PLO chairman may be losing. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, they say, is growing convinced that Rabin is trying to undo him 
personally. They say he believes that Rabin's delays in promised releases of 
Palestinian prisoners were a deliberate attempt to deprive Arafat of the 
popular response those releases would elicit. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin, he believes, may have gone back on his promise to sign an agreement 10 
days after the initial Dec. 13 deadline; this would be part of a strategy to 
finalize a peace accord but, in the process, to fatally undermine the PLO 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 He suspects that Rabin's primary fear is not of giving up territory but that 
Arafat will go in triumph to Jericho and use it as a base for building a 
Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arafat is starting to worry, somewhere in his subconscious, that the Israelis 
are out to get him," an adviser said. "And once he starts to believe they're 
out to get him personally, the whole game will change." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Arafat is playing his own game of nerves. Far from admitting defeat or 
abandoning deadlines, the PLO leader is preparing to hold the Israelis to the 
June deadline envisioned in the agreement for withdrawal from population 
centers in the West Bank and preparation for elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Under these circumstances, he says, why argue any further over the size of the 
Jericho self-rule enclave? 
</P>
<P>
 Those closest to the PLO leader say he will hold out for more concessions. But 
in the end, he will go back to the peace talks because he has no choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arafat cut all his back roads both to the Palestinian people and to the Arab 
world, and he knows he will not be accepted if he tries to come back to them 
now," said a senior PLO official who has opposed the Gaza-Jericho plan." 
</P>
<P>
 PLO officials committed to negotiating the Gaza-Jericho agreement say two 
things must happen for the negotiations to resume. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Israel must come forward with a credible package of protections, which 
at minimum disarms Jewish settlers entering Palestinian population centers, 
releases more prisoners and provides for a temporary international presence in 
the occupied territories.

 Then, they say, the Israelis must return to the bargaining table, not to 
haggle over details but to implement the spirit of the agreement. This means, 
they admit, a dangerous commitment on both sides to the idea that a former 
enemy can be trusted.

ISRAEL FREES 570 PRISONERS, SEEKS TO DRAW PLO TO TALKS 
</P>

 With expressions of sorrow and gestures of reconciliation, Israel sought 
Tuesday to persuade Palestinians to resume peace negotiations despite a Jewish 
settler's massacre of praying Muslims in a mosque in the occupied West Bank 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli military authorities released 570 Palestinian prisoners held on 
security charges and said 300 more will be freed by Friday -- roughly a tenth 
of the prisoners Israel holds. 
</P>
<P>
 Although protests over the massacre subsided in most parts of the occupied 
West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israeli troops killed a Jewish settler and wounded 
his wife late Tuesday when they opened fire on the couple's car near the West 
Bank settlement of Ariel. The soldiers said they were returning fire from the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Gen. Danny Yatom, the regional commander, had warned earlier of likely 
revenge attacks and said he was putting his forces on a higher state of alert. 
Troops also mistakenly shot two Israelis at a checkpoint Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Palestinians released Tuesday were from the West Bank; many were 
from Hebron, where the massacre occurred. Their release, originally planned for 
mid-March to mark the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, was pushed up 
as a goodwill gesture after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to calm the situation in the (occupied) territories, to 
convince the Palestinians, the Arab world and the Muslim world that not only 
did we -- the government and the army -- have nothing to do with what happened, 
but also that we are repulsed, we are disgusted and we are shocked by it," said 
Gad Ben-Ari, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. "We hope that the 
negotiations with the Palestinians will be resumed as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 But Faisal Husseini, a senior leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization 
in Jerusalem, said many more prisoners should have been freed, if not all, and 
that as a goodwill gesture the release did not respond to the Palestinians' 
grief over the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli opposition leaders criticized the move as endangering the country's 
security. "The gesture the government made to the PLO will cost us much in 
blood," said Rehavam Zeevi, leader of the right-wing Homeland Party. "It's an 
outrage. . . . I protest and oppose this with all my soul." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ora Namir, the Israeli labor and social welfare minister, announced 
that the government's welfare fund will pay compensation to families of those 
killed in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "We owe this humanitarian gesture to the Palestinians, to the Israelis and to 
the world," Namir said. "We cannot treat with indifference this population that 
was so hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Each family will receive an initial payment of about $1,700, with the final 
amount dependent on the family's size, Israeli officials said. On Monday, Saudi 
Arabia announced payments of $53,000 to each victim's family. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Rabbi Yisrael Meir Lau paid a condolence call on Sheik Hassan Tahboub, 
chairman of the Higher Islamic Council, on Tuesday to express Israeli grief 
over the Hebron attack. "I came to him with a message of peace stemming from a 
wish to calm the atmosphere," Lau said after visiting Tahboub's office adjacent 
to Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem's Old City. "There is no reason why we cannot 
return to living together in peace." 
</P>
<P>
 A delegation from the leftist Meretz Party also met Islamic leaders. "We are 
ashamed that the murderer was a Jew, and we came to be with you in this awful, 
tragic and hard time," Ran Cohen, a member of Parliament, told Tahboub. "But 
this is a time for you and us to be courageous and continue building a peaceful 
life for you, for ourselves and between us." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the government's instructions, teachers in Israel's state schools are 
conducting discussions this week among students on the value of human life, on 
democracy and on the search for peace in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important for students to discuss what happens around them, and the 
educational system is central to Israeli culture," said Rivka Shraga, a 
spokeswoman for the Education Ministry. "This is the place to examine things, 
that hard and difficult things that come in life, and to express anger if there 
is any." 
</P>
<P>
 A survey by an Israeli market research company for the International Center 
for Peace in the Middle East found that 79% of those surveyed condemned the 
action of Baruch Goldstein, the Brooklyn-born doctor who fired at least three 
magazines of bullets from his assault rifle at the backs of the kneeling 
Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 But 11% of those questioned said it "had to be understood against the 
background of Arab terror against Jews," and 3.6% praised the killer, according 
to the Teleseker polling firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Although four Israeli investigations are now under way, the number of people 
killed Friday remains uncertain. Palestinian human rights groups and West Bank 
hospitals had reported that 48 died. But Israeli military authorities said 
Tuesday that Goldstein killed 30 in the Cave of the Patriarchs and that troops 
outside killed five more in ensuing protests. 
</P>
<P>
 An independent Israeli commission is expected to begin its investigation next 
week, and it may be able to make the final determination only if it receives 
Palestinian cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Minister Moshe Shahal said security forces are searching for leaders of 
the extremist Kach movement to which the killer belonged and will detain them 
for three months under military orders or restrict their activities and travel. 
A partial list has been drawn up, he said, and police are reviewing their files 
for others.

ELDRIDGE CLEAVER IS CRITICAL AFTER BRAIN SURGERY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eldridge Cleaver, a leader in the Black Panther Party in the late 1960s, was 
reported in critical condition Tuesday following surgery for a brain 
hemorrhage. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours before his hospitalization, Cleaver had been arrested for alleged 
cocaine possession and intoxication, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleaver, 59, was taken into custody after police received reports of a prowler 
in a Berkeley neighborhood about 3:50 a.m. Tuesday, investigators said. Cleaver 
fell ill while being booked at police headquarters, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleaver was taken to Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley where he was 
diagnosed with a subdural hematoma, or bleeding of the brain. He underwent 
almost five hours of surgery to relieve pressure on his brain, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleaver was later reported in critical condition, but the spokeswoman said 
this was normal after such surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Arkansas, Cleaver spent much of his childhood in Watts before 
serving time in reformatories for bicycle theft and selling marijuana. After 
completing high school, he studied the works of Thomas Paine, Karl Marx, 
Voltaire and W.E.B. Du Bois while serving time at Soledad Prison for another 
marijuana conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 After his parole from prison, he met Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale, 
co-founders of the Black Panthers, in February, 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1968, Cleaver, who had become an information minister for the 
Panthers, was involved in a shootout in West Oakland during which party member 
Bobby Hutton was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleaver, who was wounded, was arrested after the shootout, but jumped $50,000 
bail and fled the United States. When he returned in 1975, he denounced the 
Panthers and said he had undergone a religious conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 After a protracted legal battle, attempted-murder charges connected to the 
West Oakland shootout were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 In subsequent years, Cleaver became a born-again Christian.

DMV CHECK OF IMMIGRATION TOUCHES OFF ANGER AND PRAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Martin Campos was only one day late. But the delay is likely to cause him 
lasting frustration and inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so unfair," the dejected and disbelieving fruit salesman said Tuesday 
after he left the Department of Motor Vehicles office in South-Central Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos, a 29-year-old Mexican national who acknowledged being an illegal 
immigrant, was among the first people to be turned away under a new state law 
requiring that all first-time applicants for driver's licenses and DMV 
identification cards prove that they are in the United States legally. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Southern California, DMV workers began asking all license 
applicants -- immigrants and U.S. natives -- Tuesday to produce documents 
proving their legal status in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The law is one part of an ongoing, broad-based strategy on the state and 
national levels to deny public services and other benefits to immigrants who 
are in the United States illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is designed to close the loopholes, close the magnet for people who get 
past the Border Patrol," said Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation 
for American Immigration Reform, a private group that favors restrictions on 
new immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics say such measures will only raise hardships and, in the case of 
the driver's statute, expand the pool of unlicensed and uninsured drivers -- 
increasing accidents and driving up premium payments for California motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's supposed to stop people from coming across the border, it will fail," 
said Roberto Lovato, head of the Central American Resource Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, thousands of immigrants have jammed DMV offices statewide seeking to 
beat the deadline. Confusion has been rampant. Although the law only applies to 
new applicants, many immigrants beat a path to the DMV to renew their licenses, 
rather than take any chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Los Angeles-area DMV offices reported double the normal workload Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday was pretty hectic," said Dolores Orrante of the Van Nuys DMV 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fullerton, DMV workers took about 750 photographs for licenses and 
identification cards Monday, compared to the usual 500, said Al Gausman, the 
office's operations officer. 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday, crowds had diminished throughout the Southland. Processing of new 
license applicants did take a little longer because of workers' need to check 
any of 20 documents -- including birth certificates, immigration green cards 
and U.S. citizenship papers -- that the DMV requires to prove legal presence. 
</P>
<P>
 As mandated by the law, officials said they were asking all new applicants for 
proof of their legal presence in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we care about is the paperwork, not what someone looks like," said Joyce 
A. Rhodes of the South-Central Los Angeles DMV office. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrants who do not have proof of legal residence will be turned away -- but 
not reported to U.S. immigration authorities, officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials said things ran smoothly Tuesday, many immigrants -- even 
those possessing legal documents -- were bitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomas Vazquez was livid that his wife was unable to get a DMV identification 
card. "What if, God forbid, she's in an accident and she has no identification. 
Will they bury her in a common grave?" 
</P>
<P>
 The DMV initially opposed the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt in my mind that this poses a hardship on the Hispanic 
community and personally, I don't like it," said Francisco Gamboa, manager of 
the Market Street DMV office in Ventura. "But it's the law." 
</P>

Fernando Valley and Mark Gladstone in Sacramento and correspondents Richard 
Core in Orange County and J.E. Mitchell in Ventura.

ON CALIFORNIA: BACK INTO THE SWING OF SPRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
 The sound of an aluminum bat striking a yellow plastic ball might not satisfy 
baseball purists. It's hardly the stuff of Ring Lardner or Grantland Rice, the 
crack of hickory against horsehide and all that. Still, for me anyway, it's 
satisfying enough, and also it is a sound of the season. Forget what the 
calendar might say: Spring has come to California, and a rite of spring, for me 
anyway, is a return to the Glendale Batting Cages. 
</P>
<P>
 Thwang. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility is not fancy. It consists of a blacktop lot surrounded by netting 
and equipped with a line of well-worn pitching machines. The machines are 
calibrated for varying speeds and bear the names of famous pitchers. The 
fastest, which slings balls at about 80 m.p.h., is designated the "Koufax" 
cage. The next fastest is "Drysdale." Little Leaguers hit in the Vida Blue 
cage, a clear case of regional bias. 
</P>
<P>
 Thwang. 
</P>
<P>
 I started coming here about 10 years ago. At first, it was to sharpen softball 
skills. Later, I hooked up with a senior sandlot league for hardball has-beens 
and never-weres, and logged even more cage time. And now, even though I moved 
last fall to Northern California, I found myself as the weather turned almost 
drawn back to the Glendale cages. There's a bit more involved than batting 
practice. I understand that the ability to hit a fastball counts for little in 
everyday grown-up life. Still, the discovery each spring that the eye and 
reflexes have survived another winter provides a measure of comfort. Perhaps 
it's a flimsy hold on something certain not to last. Whatever, I'll take it. 
</P>
<P>
 Thwang. 
</P>
<P>
 It was warm enough Monday afternoon to hit only in shorts and a T-shirt. The 
air was sweet, and the sunlight's tint and texture was of the sort that first 
put California on the map: golden. To the east, the San Gabriels were greening 
up. Above, a skywriting airplane inscribed a large heart over Los Angeles. Who 
knows why? It was spring. And it also was still February. 
</P>
<P>
 Thwang. 
</P>
<P>
 All sorts can be found at the cages. Little Leaguers, male and female. 
Softball players, male and female. Serious young men who spend hours learning 
to hit the other way. Fathers who come to coach their sons, revealing, as they 
lose it, too much emotional investment in the exercise. The cage next to mine 
was occupied by four high school kids. They were rusty. From their cage came 
the "thwap" of missed balls striking the rubber backstop, and also constant 
chatter. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are pulling your head, dude." 
</P>
<P>
 "That swing looks so stupid, dude." 
</P>
<P>
 Thwap. 
</P>
<P>
 Concentration counts. If the mind wanders, so will the bat. To hit at the cage 
is to forget about the everyday. That's part of the payoff. On Monday I forgot 
about gubernatorial candidates and the California economy, about the tax man 
and a dog that won't behave. I focused on keeping my head down, my arms out and 
my eyes on the ball. I just hit. It was fun. The joints were loose, the sweat 
came easy, the contact was solid. It was spring, and who cares about the rest 
of it anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 Thwang. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing I've observed at the cage is that crossing rituals of season can 
produce poor results. Young bucks who bring girlfriends out to admire their 
seasonal debut invariably find themselves unable to make contact with the ball 
. . . or maintain contact with the belle. They huff and puff and curse and 
blame the bat and the angle of the pitches. Their captive audiences of one, 
sometimes embarrassed, sometimes bemused, will look the other way, purse lips 
and, it seems, muse in silence over what is worse -- a boyfriend who is a 
klutz, or a boyfriend who cares too much about not looking like a klutz? 
Romance can make hitting fastballs seem like simple business. 
</P>
<P>
 Thwang. 
</P>
<P>
 The fellows in the next cage over did not last long. One of their coaches had 
shown up to tender much advice about locking elbows and pivoting hips. Their 
ears and their hearts, though, were elsewhere. To mention but a few of the 
relevant parts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's go call Nicki, dude," one suggested to the others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell her to call Clara and let her know we're coming over," said another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Find out if Alice is over there, dude," pitched in a third. 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys need to get ready for the game Friday," the coach objected. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't stand a chance. His charges took a few more cuts, turned their caps 
around backward, and then shambled away down Colorado Boulevard, revealing as 
they went a lot more quickness than they'd shown at the plate. Ah, sighed the 
"fud" one cage over, it's spring. No, dude, he corrected himself, it's a 
fastball. Now swing.

LEGISLATORS FEAR PUBLIC ON '3 STRIKES,' BROWN SAYS; CRIME: LAWMAKERS, INCLUDING 
HIMSELF, ARE BOWING TO INTENSE PRESSURE, SPEAKER SAYS. 'HORROR STORIES WIPE 
AWAY RATIONALITY,' HE ADDS. 
</P>

<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) said Tuesday there is so much 
public pressure that proposed "three strikes and you're out" anti-crime 
legislation will be passed and enacted without rational dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the recent shooting of rookie Los Angeles Police Officer Christy Lynne 
Hamilton, Brown said: "The people are frightened, really frightened. Those kind 
of horror stories wipe away rationality." 
</P>
<P>
 The Speaker said the "three strikes" measures, with their enormous estimated 
costs, are not the answer to stopping crime, but that state legislators have 
"zero courage" on the subject because "they like their jobs and want to be 
reelected." He said the judgment applied to all state and local officeholders, 
himself included. "We have all bailed out on this one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if this amounted to a failure of the legislative process, Brown said: 
"No. This is a representative body. And (legislators) believe they are 
representing the will of their constituency." 
</P>
<P>
 "If (Gov.) Pete Wilson really wants to become a profile in courage he will 
lead the charge to get a rational dialogue going on this issue," Brown told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if his own persuasive powers could help get a dialogue going, he said: 
"I got out of the way of this train because I am a realist." 
</P>
<P>
 Queried about a state Department of Corrections report showing that California 
would have to build 20 prisons and spend $2 billion a year to operate them by 
the turn of the century if a "three strikes" measure becomes law, Brown 
replied: "It didn't surprise me at all. My guess is that they may even be low." 
</P>
<P>
 How is the state to pay the price tag? "I have absolutely no idea," the 
Speaker said. "I don't think the public believes we will need a tax increase. 
The public believes that somewhere the funds can be found within the existing 
revenue stream." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the Senate probably will approve all five "three strikes" measures 
this week that cleared the Assembly, and leave it up to Wilson to decide which 
one he should sign into law. 
</P>
<P>
 The Speaker indicated that although he dislikes aspects of all the measures, 
the best appears to be a bill authored by Assemblyman Richard K. Rainey 
(R-Walnut Creek), a former Contra Costa County sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 That measure would impose life imprisonment without parole for people who are 
convicted of a third violent crime.

DISASTER AID UNEVEN, STUDY SAYS; RECOVERY: UC BERKELEY REPORT ON BAY AREA QUAKE 
FINDS THAT MOST RELIEF EFFORTS HELP MIDDLE-CLASS HOMEOWNERS RATHER THAN 
APARTMENT DWELLERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As Southern California struggles to heal the gash left in its housing stock by 
the Northridge earthquake, a new UC Berkeley study warns that disaster recovery 
programs are skewed toward middle-class homeowners and fail to provide the 
assistance necessary to repair affordable apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 In a detailed analysis of the aftermath of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, 
researchers found that three-fourths of the 12,000 housing units lost in that 
disaster were multifamily buildings, and about 50% remained unrepaired or 
unreplaced four years later. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, homeowners in the Bay Area received 62% of the more than $1 
billion in housing repair funds, even though single-family homes accounted for 
40% of the damaged units, according to the report by the university's Institute 
of Urban and Regional Development. 
</P>
<P>
 It is too soon to know how severely and permanently the Northridge earthquake 
will affect the affordable rental stock, Los Angeles officials say. But they 
acknowledge that they are worried about many of the problems spotlighted in the 
report, and are rushing to devise solutions that will limit long-term housing 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the biggest multifamily housing (recovery) challenge that has ever 
been faced by the nation," said city housing department chief Gary Squier, 
noting that about 18,000 apartment units have been vacated in the city of Los 
Angeles. Authorities fear that many of those could be abandoned by their owners 
because falling property values and high pre-earthquake vacancy rates make them 
poor candidates for additional investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Central to the problems of bringing back affordable units, the UC Berkeley 
study said, has been a historical bias in disaster programs toward homeowners. 
Relief programs generally evolved in response to disasters in more rural, 
sparsely populated settings, such as floods in the Midwest and hurricanes in 
the South, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although several disaster housing programs focus on helping homeowners with 
uninsured losses, only one or two -- chiefly Small Business Administration 
loans -- are available to apartment owners, often at rates only slightly better 
than those offered by private lending institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Virtually all the agency recovery programs are designed for a prototypical, 
or ideal, victim who owns or rents a housing unit which is adequate, 
conventional and replicable," says the study, which was being finalized when 
the Jan 17. Northridge quake hit. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, a significant portion of Loma Prieta victims lived in "old, 
poorly maintained, overcrowded, structurally unsound buildings because they 
could not afford better quality accommodations. For these victims, there was no 
existing agency program to rebuild housing units at pre-disaster rents," the 
study said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Comerio, an associate professor and co-author of the study commissioned 
by the California Office of Emergency Services, said: "The two earthquakes in 
California should be sending the message that the (old) model is not really 
applicable anymore. . . . This is a national problem that could affect all 
cities." 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, she said, disaster relief programs have wrongly assumed that 
marketplace forces can address housing imbalances caused by disasters. But the 
Bay Area earthquake highlighted the marginal economics of many older, 
lower-rent buildings in big cities, and the limited ability of owners to raise 
rents and service additional debt, Comerio said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study offers a series of recommendations for improving recovery programs 
for affordable housing units, including a more balanced distribution of aid 
between single-family homes and apartments, streamlining the application 
process for apartment repair loans and offering special incentives to repair 
and rebuild rental units quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles and federal officials say they recognize the problems experienced 
in the Bay Area and are trying to adjust the response effort. 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage reinvestment in rental units, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan 
and U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Henry Cisneros last week 
led a major financing and public assistance workshop at the Convention Center 
for owners of quake-damaged apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 City housing officials also announced a new federally backed, $30-million 
low-interest loan program for owners of damaged units. They would be eligible 
for up to $15,000 per unit in repair loans, repayable at 3% interest, but only 
after cash flow increases to cover the additional debt load. Still in the 
talking stage is a pool of low-interest funds for private lending institutions 
that would allow them to ease the debt costs for owners of quake-damaged 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our theme is we are encouraging the lenders to stay in, and we are 
encouraging owners to stay in," said Bob Moncrief, director of major projects 
for the Los Angeles housing department. 
</P>
<P>
 Apartment industry groups say some apartment owners clearly need financial aid 
to rebuild, but they say no one knows how many quake-damaged units are in 
jeopardy of being abandoned, or how that might affect the affordable housing 
rental market in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea. I don't think we are going to know for three or four months," 
said Dan Faller, president of the 12,000-member Apartment Owners Assn. of 
Southern California.

HOTEL GROUP BACKS WORKPLACE SMOKING BAN; LEGISLATION: SWITCH BY ASSOCIATION 
BOOSTS CHANCES OF BILL THAT WOULD IMPOSE THE MOST SWEEPING RESTRICTIONS OF ANY 
STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A hotel owners association that had been a leading foe of a bill to ban 
workplace smoking switched positions Tuesday, boosting chances that the measure 
will clear the Legislature this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In making the announcement, Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood) said 
the endorsement by the California Hotel & Motel Assn. defuses a main argument 
against his proposed smoking ban -- that it would damage the tourism industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "This leaves the tobacco industry virtually alone, unable to seek cover by 
pointing to some other legitimate organization's arguments," Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Applying to most indoor workplaces, the bill would create the most sweeping 
smoking restrictions of any state and would allow cities to impose even tougher 
smoking ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman said he won the hotel owners' endorsement after agreeing to amend his 
bill to allow smoking in 65% of hotel rooms, in hotel lobbies, in banquet rooms 
during private gatherings and, temporarily at least, in bars. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would require the California Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration to develop standards regulating smoking in bars by 1997. If 
Cal-OSHA fails to develop the standards, Friedman said, the ban would extend to 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman said he intends to push for passage of the bill this month in the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, where the legislation stalled last year. If it wins 
Senate approval, the bill would have to return to the Assembly for approval of 
the Senate amendments. It is not known whether Gov. Pete Wilson would sign the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 James Abrams, director of the hotel association, called the organization's new 
position "good public policy." 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel association was among the most active lobbyists against the bill 
last year. The possibility remains that individual hotel owners might continue 
to oppose the smoking ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always a risk when you get involved in controversial issues that some of 
your members will not agree with you," Abrams said. "We hope none of them would 
feel (it) would be grounds to leave the organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel association lobbyists had contended that a smoking ban would result in 
California hotels losing tourist trade to states with few smoking restrictions. 
Several lawmakers cited that argument in their opposition to Friedman's 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Lee Stitzenberger of the Dolphin Group, a political consulting firm 
in Westwood, said he will continue efforts to qualify an initiative for the 
November ballot to repeal all local smoking bans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen nothing to change my mind" about moving forward with the 
initiative, Stitzenberger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, backed by tobacco giant Philip Morris U.S.A., would remove 
most smoking restrictions and generally leave it to individual business owners 
to decide smoking policy.

SWEDEN, FINLAND, AUSTRIA OK TERMS FOR EU MEMBERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER MARSHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than 30 hours of continuous negotiations, Sweden, Finland and 
Austria agreed Tuesday to terms that would allow them to join the European 
Union next New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 While the terms of the negotiated entry must still pass through an arduous 
ratification process, Tuesday's accords effectively set in motion the EU's 
first expansion since its 12 member states committed themselves to the goal of 
full political and economic union more than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most important agreement Sweden has entered this century," said 
Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt in a radio interview from Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
 Finland's foreign trade minister, Pertti Salolainen, who helped negotiate his 
country's entry package, called the accord historic. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of Finland would give the EU, formerly known as the European 
Community, its first common frontier with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 As exhausted negotiators celebrated the group's hard-won accords with the two 
Nordic countries and Austria, EU officials said negotiations with a fourth 
country, Norway, seemed stalled and will probably be adjourned until early next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The EU had set a deadline of midnight Monday to complete the year-old talks to 
leave enough time to get through the ratification process by the formal entry 
date of Jan. 1. The terms of accession must be approved by the European 
Parliament in Strasbourg, France, and the parliaments of the countries in 
question, and then subjected to national referendums. 
</P>
<P>
 If talks with Norway succeed and all four eventually join, their entry will 
make the EU the world's largest and richest single consumer market, with a 
total population of 375 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from adding to the EU's size, a successful expansion would have several 
other important ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Entry of four of the continent's richest, most stable democracies would give 
new strength to the EU at a time when its members are struggling with immense 
economic difficulties. It would pave the way for nations of Nordic Europe -- in 
addition to Denmark, already a member -- to join the push toward the EU's 
stated goal of full political and monetary union. 
</P>
<P>
 "Countries must come together that belong together," summed up Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel of Germany, the EU's most populous member. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more important, however, a successful round of enlargement 
negotiations would provide a much-needed psychological boost for those fighting 
to contain the revival of ultranationalism that has gathered strength in 
several European countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, for many, the crucial drama now unfolding in Europe is the struggle of 
those trying to sustain the momentum of the dream of European unity in the face 
of growing economic strains and the small but virulent neo-fascist movements 
that feed so well on such misery. 
</P>
<P>
 The entry of Austria and the Nordic countries is also seen as a final 
necessary step before the EU reaches out to accept some of the new democracies 
in formerly Communist Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 But in contrast to the lofty nature of the stakes involved, the talks with all 
four countries have dealt mainly with the hard, narrow issues of economic 
self-interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks with Sweden, for example, succeeded only when EU negotiators agreed 
to a 3% increase in Sweden's milk quota and $66 million more from the common 
budget; the accord with Finland was stuck for hours on the level of subsidies 
the EU would be willing to provide the Finnish food processing industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations with Austria had bogged down over its insistence on restrictions 
through 2004 on heavy truck traffic roaring across its Alpine roads. Despite 
French misgivings, the EU agreed to let Austria limit truck traffic until 2001.

NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE / HEALTH CARE; THE DOCTORING BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Karen Tumulty, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 And now the real work begins on Capitol Hill. Just about every congressional 
committee can expect a piece of the action in crafting health care reform, but 
the bulk of the job will be done by five panels, the first of which will take 
up the task next week. President Clinton's plan is just a starting point. 
Indications are that the committees will produce far different versions, from 
which the House and Senate Democratic leadership; must draw up legislation that 
not only can pass Congress but also can be signed into law by a President who 
has vowed to veto any bill that does not guarantee coverage for all Americans. 
Leaders hope to have a bill to Clinton's desk by their August recess. House 
Ways and Means 
</P>
<P>
 This committee is the first to begin work. And even before it started, health 
subcommittee Chairman Pete Stark (D-Oakland) pronounced the death of the 
alliances, the giant purchasing cooperatives whose clout in the marketplace 
would help hold down medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Original plans to begin drafting legislation on Tuesday were delayed until 
next week as lawmakers awaited cost estimates and financing details on Stark's 
alternative. His plan would focus on covering the uninsured by offering them a 
version of Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski, whose skills at bringing disparate views in line is legendary, 
is guided less by his views on health care than by his desire to produce 
something that will pass. His signals in recent days suggest that the 
Administration should lower its expectations, because the ultimate legislation 
is likely to be far less comprehensive than Clinton had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski, however, could be taken out of action -- an irreplaceable loss 
to Clinton -- if his legal problems result in an indictment. House Energy and 
Commerce 
</P>
<P>
 Dingell's dreams of health care reform go back more than a half-century to the 
national health insurance legislation that his congressman father introduced in 
the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 However, members of the health subcommittee of Energy and Commerce are far 
less amenable to the idea, in no small measure because Dingell loaded the panel 
with moderate and conservative Democrats in the 1980s. He did so to counter the 
influence of subcommittee Chairman Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) during a 
battle over the Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Waxman, one of Clinton's chief allies in Congress, finds himself unable to 
overcome his subcommittee's opposition to Clinton's proposed employer mandate, 
which would require employers to provide health insurance to their workers, and 
to the President's plan to control costs through premium caps. One member of 
the subcommittee, Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), is touting an alternative that has won 
at least tentative support from business and is being seen as the chief rival 
to the Clinton plan. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, it appears that he and Dingell may have to bypass the 
subcommittee altogether and write the bill at the full committee level. House 
Education and Labor 
</P>
<P>
 For Ford, who is retiring this year, passage of sweeping health care reform 
could be the crowning achievement of a half-century political career as a 
champion of social legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The most liberal of the major House committees to deal with major portions of 
the health bill, Ford's panel is where Clinton's plan will have the easiest 
time. For the same reason, the committee is somewhat out of touch with more 
mainstream concerns about the Clinton plan in the House, and the panel's 
influence on the final result could be limited. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, swift and easy passage of the President's plan through the 
committee, which is expected some time after Easter, could give the 
Administration a badly needed psychological and public relations boost at a 
time when it may need it most. Senate Finance Committee 
</P>
<P>
 This is probably the committee to watch most closely. With only an 11-9 
Democratic majority, Moynihan cannot afford to lose a single vote. The chairman 
himself has made no secret of his own reservations about the Clinton plan, at 
one point describing its financing as "fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats on the committee include John B. Breaux (D-La.), chief sponsor 
of the Cooper plan in the Senate. Among the Republican members are Minority 
Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, Clinton's most powerful opponent in Congress, and 
John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, who is sponsoring the most moderate GOP 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, fighting for the Clinton plan on the committee will be some 
of the President's closest health care allies, including Majority Leader George 
J. Mitchell (D-Me.), whose position will give him a crack at reshaping the 
legislation before and when it reaches the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan can be expected to try to bridge party lines with a compromise that 
could win at least a few GOP votes. However, that would certainly mean 
sacrificing some Clinton principles -- probably the alliances, premium caps and 
the size of the employer mandate. Senate Labor and Human Resources 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, who was a voice on health care reform long before it moved to the 
political forefront, has put aside his own preference for a more radical 
Canadian-style, government-financed system. Kennedy sees the President's 
approach as the first real chance for significant change and does not want to 
let the opportunity slip away. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's backing is also important beyond his committee, because he is the 
most powerful member of the Senate's liberal bloc. Once the bill gets to the 
Senate floor, Kennedy can be expected to sway about a dozen votes. That 
influence may be needed if the final bill proves to be less than the left had 
hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House is also counting on Kennedy, with his instant name 
recognition, to help sell the plan to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, his committee may try to pull the Clinton plan further to the 
left, with more government involvement and richer benefits. Yet the further it 
goes in that direction, the less likely it is to pass when put to a vote by the 
Senate as a whole, which is far more conservative.

AT RUSSIAN URGING, SERBS AGREE TO LET AIRPORT OPEN; BOSNIA: RELIEF FLIGHTS WILL 
BE ALLOWED INTO TUZLA. REBEL LEADER MAKES ANNOUNCEMENT DURING MOSCOW VISIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 At Russia's urging, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic capitulated in a 
major standoff with the West by agreeing Tuesday to allow U.N. forces to reopen 
an airport in northern Bosnia-Herzegovina for humanitarian relief flights. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement by Karadzic -- during a Moscow visit in which he had sought 
moral support in the Balkan conflict -- clearly indicated that there are limits 
to the political capital Russia is willing to spend on its internationally 
condemned Serbian allies who are waging war against other Slavs. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic's concession in allowing the airport to reopen was the second time in 
less than two weeks that Russia has intervened to resolve an impasse in the 
Balkan crisis. It was at Moscow's insistence that Karadzic complied with a NATO 
ultimatum to withdraw or surrender heavy weapons around Sarajevo by Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serb leader flew to Moscow on Monday, only hours after North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization forces shot down four planes that Karadzic 
loyalists had used to fly combat missions in violation of a U.N. "no-fly" order 
imposed over Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO's first-ever use of force may have changed the course of the Bosnian 
conflict by showing combatants there that the West is committed to resolving 
the war that has racked the former Yugoslav republic for 23 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of getting an endorsement of the hard-line control that Serbian rebels 
have maintained over the airport, Karadzic emerged from talks with Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev to announce that a U.N.-operated 
humanitarian airlift to the mostly Muslim Tuzla region will begin soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at U.N. headquarters in New York last week set next Monday as the 
deadline for opening the strategic airport to funnel food and other relief 
goods to those in need in the largest of Bosnian government-held regions. At 
least 800,000 people live in the Tuzla pocket, hemmed in by a Serbian rebel 
siege on three sides and by fighting between Muslims and Croats to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 At a NATO summit in January, the Western alliance threatened to use force, if 
necessary, to establish an airlift to Tuzla and to ensure safe rotation of a 
U.N. peacekeeping contingent in another besieged Muslim enclave, Srebrenica. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic and his military chieftains had conceded the troop rotation issue. 
But they refused to give assurances that an airlift, like the one servicing 
Sarajevo, would be allowed to operate out of Tuzla. The rebels contended that 
the airport, although under U.N. administration, would be used to deliver 
weapons to the Bosnian government. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released after Karadzic and Kozyrev met, the Russian Foreign 
Ministry announced that the Tuzla airlift will begin "in the near future" and 
that Russian observers will be stationed at the site to ensure that the 
operation remains humanitarian. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement suggested that the opening may not occur definitively next 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 By pushing back the start-up and insisting on some Russian presence at the 
airport, Moscow provided a face-saving retreat for the Bosnian Serbs. Russians 
share the Orthodox faith with the Serbs but have had to walk a narrow path 
between their traditional allies and the Western countries with which they hope 
to establish stronger political and economic ties in the post-Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic's sudden visit to Moscow consolidated a strategy under which Kozyrev 
has been deployed to tackle the Serbian side of the Balkan conflict while 
leaving Washington to deal with the Muslims and Croats. 
</P>
<P>
 By compelling Karadzic to give up rebel opposition to the relief mission, 
Moscow showed itself to be more aligned with the international community's 
quest for peace in the Balkans than behind the Serbian nationalists whose 
deadly land-grab has drawn widespread condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrei V. Kortunov, a foreign policy expert at Moscow's U.S.A.-Canada 
Institute, said Russia has established a "balanced position, trying not to 
corner the Serbs," and has found that approach "more promising than NATO's 
rigid position." 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that Russian diplomacy has somewhat unexpectedly been a 
serious success," Kortunov said. He argued that backing the Serbs into a corner 
could prompt them to behave "even more irrationally and aggressively." 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's role in the crisis remains suspect among supporters of the Bosnian 
government, however, because of the obvious backing Russian troops have given 
the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 When 400 Russian peacekeepers arrived in Serb-held areas around Sarajevo on 
the eve of the NATO ultimatum, they soaked up the cheers and plum brandy 
offered by jubilant Serbian civilians and flashed the three-fingered sign of 
solidarity with their Orthodox brothers. The reception prompted Bosnia's Muslim 
president, Alija Izetbegovic, to appeal to the United Nations not to send more 
Russian soldiers to his republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow's special envoy for the Balkan crisis, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly 
S. Churkin, said during his latest visit to Sarajevo that the Russians were 
sent to provide "a degree of psychological comfort" for Serbs once their heavy 
artillery was withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Russian soldiers, however, told journalists that they had been 
sent to protect the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, U.S. and British officials went out of their way to praise 
Russian intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can be influential with the Serbs in bringing about a settlement 
that'll be acceptable to the Muslims and the Croatians, then I think we'd 
welcome that kind of help," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, during a brief news conference Tuesday with British Prime 
Minister John Major, said he was "encouraged" by the "willingness of the 
Russians to work with us and others trying to bring the Serbs into a final 
peace agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Major made a similar statement and announced plans to send a U.S.-British 
civil engineering team to Sarajevo to begin work on repairing roads, bridges 
and other facilities that have been damaged by nearly two years of war. 
</P>
<P>
 The team will involve "engineers from the U.K. and the U.S. going there to 
look at ways to get gas service, water service, electrical service back, to 
restore some of the infrastructures -- roads, bridges," White House Press 
Secretary Dee Dee Myers said.

MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL OFFICIAL SPIED FOR BRITAIN, RUSSIANS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A senior Russian official in the military-industrial complex has confessed to 
spying for Britain and has been charged with treason, Russian officials 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The bombshell, widening the espionage war between Moscow and the West, comes 
just when U.S. officials thought the exchange of unpleasantness over the 
alleged spying of CIA official Aldrich H. Ames for the Kremlin was over. On 
Monday, Russia expelled a U.S. diplomat it said was the CIA station chief here 
in retaliation for the expulsion last week of the alleged Russian intelligence 
chief in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides had expressed hope that the diplomatic tit for tat would end the 
spat triggered by the Feb. 22 arrests of Ames and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday, the Federal Counterintelligence Service, the KGB successor agency 
responsible for rooting out foreign spies on Russian soil, suddenly announced 
the espionage arrest. The alleged spy, an unnamed top official "within a 
military-industrial complex organization," had been given special spy equipment 
for writing invisible messages and had been delivering military and economic 
secrets to the British Embassy in Moscow for more than a year, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 The British Embassy in Moscow and the British Foreign Office in London had no 
comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 One noteworthy aspect of the announcement was that officials said the man was 
arrested Jan. 15 and confessed 10 days later, nearly one month before Ames and 
his wife were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Counterintelligence Service did announce in January that 20 
Russians had been arrested for spying for foreign countries last year. But it 
did not give any details. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikhail P. Lyubimov, a former KGB station chief in Copenhagen, said the 
British spy flap is in the "vintage Soviet style of leaving no blow 
unanswered." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't yet call this a revival of the Cold War," said retired KGB Gen. 
Oleg D. Kalugin. "But it demonstrates at minimum that some of those still in or 
close to power who are interested in reviving the Cold War are very active, 
jumping at the opportunity to flex muscles the world hoped were gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Kalugin faulted the United States for provoking the conflict but said Russia 
should have limited its retaliation to Monday's expulsion of U.S. Embassy 
counselor James L. Morris. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrest announcement is in keeping with the harder foreign policy line that 
President Boris N. Yeltsin struck in his first State of the Nation address to 
Parliament last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But a spokeswoman for the Foreign Intelligence Service, the agency that would 
have directed Ames if he was in fact a Russian spy, struck a conciliatory note. 
Tatyana V. Samolis noted that Russian intelligence wants to continue to 
cooperate with its Western counterparts in fighting arms proliferation, 
international organized crime and terrorism.

NEW RULES EXPECTED TO CUT 90% OF TOXICS IN AIR; ENVIRONMENT: SWEEPING 
REGULATIONS REQUIRE PLANTS TO BE MODERNIZED, BOOST POLLUTION CONTROLS. 
CALIFORNIA IS NOT AMONG STATES MOST AFFECTED.

<P>
 The Clinton Administration announced new environmental regulations Tuesday 
designed to scrub 90% of chemical plants' toxic emissions from the nation's 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweeping new regulations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency 
require chemical manufacturers to modernize and improve pollution-control 
efforts over the next three years. The rules also add 112 chemicals to the list 
of hazardous materials regulated by the federal government under the Clean Air 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA estimated that the regulations will reduce acid rain and improve the 
respiratory health of many Americans by removing 506,000 tons of toxic 
chemicals from the atmosphere. That's the equivalent of taking 38 million 
automobiles, one-fourth of the nation's total, off the road. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new rules also are expected to exact a price from some 370 chemical 
manufacturers and their consumers. The EPA said that new measures will cost the 
chemical industry $530 million a year, raising prices for the average family 
about $1.50 annually. The Chemical Manufacturers Assn., which expressed support 
for the rules, said that in addition to those operating costs, the industry 
probably will have to make almost a billion dollars in capital investments. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA Administrator Carol Browner called the new rules "a landmark for public 
health" that will save lives, prevent cancer and other serious illnesses, 
increase crop yields and protect forests and fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Browner added that the regulations also are intended to improve conditions in 
many poor and minority communities. Studies have shown that such areas bear a 
disproportionate share of toxic pollution from manufacturers, especially in 
states like Louisiana, where petrochemical refineries and processors are 
concentrated around a large number of African American communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials have said that the new rules will affect chemical 
manufacturers and their neighborhoods in 38 states. But the greatest impact 
will be on Louisiana, New Jersey and Texas, they said. California and other 
states with a smaller concentration of chemical manufacturers and with strict 
state and local environmental regulations will be less affected by the new 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the regulations, many chemical manufacturers will have to install new 
scrubbers, burners and sealing devices on smokestacks and holding tanks and on 
pumps and nozzles that transfer chemicals from one point to another. One 
industry official said that the technology is "not rocket science. It's just 
closing the loops" to prevent the escape of pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA's rules came after several years of negotiations among 
environmentalists, chemical manufacturers and federal regulators under two 
administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 In drawing up the new regulations, the Clinton Administration bowed to 
chemical manufacturers and allowed what it called "emissions averaging" to give 
companies flexibility. The concept would enable individual chemical 
manufacturers to make extra reductions in some sources of emissions to offset 
pollution elsewhere in their plants.

MIDEAST PEACE PROCESS; CHRISTOPHER CALLS ARAFAT KEY TO PEACE; DIPLOMACY: BUT 
ADMINISTRATION RULES OUT PRESSING ISRAEL TO MEET PLO CHIEF'S CONDITIONS FOR 
RESUMING TALKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Tuesday described Yasser Arafat, the 
Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, as "the indispensable figure" in 
the Middle East peace process, but the Clinton Administration ruled out 
pressing Israel to meet Arafat's conditions for resuming negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 After an early morning telephone conversation with Arafat, Christopher 
acknowledged that the PLO is unwilling to return to the bargaining table unless 
Israel imposes more restrictions on militant Jewish settlers. The PLO demands 
the restrictions to ensure the safety of Palestinian civilians after Friday's 
massacre of worshipers in a Hebron mosque by a settler armed with an assault 
rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate appearances on Capitol Hill, Christopher and Robert H. Pelletreau, 
his department's top Middle East expert, outlined an Administration strategy 
intended to cajole Arafat into accepting steps that the Israelis have already 
taken to detain some extremist Jewish leaders and disarm some of their 
followers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Christopher and Pelletreau made it clear that the Administration will not 
pressure Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's government to do more. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher told the House Appropriations Committee that Arafat told him the 
PLO "needs some time" to allow emotions ignited by the Hebron killings to 
subside before resuming peace talks. But Christopher said he is optimistic that 
the negotiations will resume in Washington, as President Clinton proposed after 
the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 In an uncharacteristic rhetorical flourish, the usually bland Christopher said 
that the peace process cannot go ahead without Arafat's participation. "He is 
the indispensable figure," he said. "He is a political leader, but he is also 
the flag and 'The Star-Spangled Banner' all wrapped into one person." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel and the PLO signed an agreement last September in Washington calling 
for limited Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of 
Jericho. But many details were left to be sorted out by future negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said that Israeli and PLO bargainers had settled many issues 
before the Hebron killings. The Administration's objective at this point is to 
prevent either side from reopening questions that have already been settled. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said the PLO is expected to send an 
envoy to Washington later this week to try to get the talks back on track. But 
PLO sources in Tunis, Tunisia, said the Palestinian representative will not be 
ready to negotiate with the Israelis. Instead, he will try to persuade the 
Administration to press Israel to crack down on militant settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department officials dismissed rumors that Clinton will invite Arafat 
and Rabin to meet in Washington. Rabin is already scheduled to visit the United 
States this month. "No thought is being given to inviting Arafat to come here," 
the official said. "The focus right now is on bringing back the negotiators." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the Israeli Cabinet ordered detention without trial for some 
extremist settlers -- a punishment usually reserved for Palestinian militants. 
The government also said it will confiscate weapons from settlers who use them 
for anything other than self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel also indicated it will accept unarmed international observers, but it 
rejected outside forces to protect Palestinian civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, who described the action as "hollow and superficial," wants Israel to 
do much more: dismantle some settlements, especially in Hebron and the Gaza 
Strip; allow international peacekeepers throughout the occupied territories; 
disarm all settlers, and negotiate the future of settlements in the current 
talks instead of the next phase, at least two years away. 
</P>
<P>
 Pelletreau said the Israeli government's actions are positive as long as they 
are rapidly and effectively carried out. He said the Israeli steps "must be 
seen as more than tokenism." 
</P>
<P>
 But in response to questions from Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), chairman of 
the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Pelletreau said the Administration does 
not support the Palestinians' demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many people will the Israelis be disarming?" Hamilton asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have initially declared that they will put five people in administrative 
detention and they will be disarming others on an individual basis," Pelletreau 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many would you put in the militant settler category?" Hamilton asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several thousand," Pelletreau said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it their intention to disarm all of those?" Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe it is their intention to disarm all of those, but it is their 
intention to take a series of measures with respect to the militant settlers 
that will greatly reduce the opportunities for confrontation and the 
possibility of violence," Pelletreau said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a related issue, Pelletreau said the Administration "would certainly be 
willing to consider" an Israeli request for U.S. assistance to pay compensation 
to Jewish settlers who want to move from the West Bank or Gaza back to Israel 
proper. Polls show that many settlers would abandon the occupied territories if 
offered adequate compensation.

SALINAS TO SEEK VOTE OBSERVERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, eager to show that August presidential 
elections will be free of fraud, will propose allowing foreign observers, a 
spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, to be made Thursday at election reform talks between Interior 
Minister Jorge Carpizo MacGregor and political parties, will break a 
longstanding national taboo against foreign election observers. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas' governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has been in power 
since 1929, has previously ruled out foreign observers as an unacceptable 
breach of Mexican sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressure for electoral reform has been building in Mexico, particularly since 
the uprising launched New Year's Day in the southern state of Chiapas by 
Indians belonging to the self-styled Zapatista National Liberation Army.

BEIJING SHOWS VIDEOTAPES OF 4 PROMINENT DISSIDENTS; CHINA: U.S. SENATORS HAD 
CALLED FOR PRISONERS' RELEASE. GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO HAVE BALKED AT THE REQUEST. 
</P>

<P>
 Under increasing U.S. pressure to demonstrate progress on human rights, 
Chinese officials on Tuesday showed reporters videotapes of four prominent 
dissidents celebrating with their families in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The brief tapes, intended to show that the prisoners are in good health and 
being treated humanely, included footage of 1989 democracy movement leaders 
Chen Ziming, Wang Juntao, Ren Wanding and Liu Gang. It was the first time that 
any of the celebrated prisoners have been viewed by foreign reporters since the 
men were sentenced in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 All four were named in a Feb. 24 letter signed by 54 U.S. senators calling for 
their early release from prison on "medical parole." The letter -- which also 
named the imprisoned Bao Tong, the former Politburo political secretary accused 
of siding with protesters in the 1989 Tian An Men Square demonstrations -- was 
presented to Chinese officials this week by John Shattuck, assistant secretary 
of state for human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 In what has become a diplomatic chess match between the United States and 
China over human rights, the Senate letter stated that the release of the five 
men for "urgent health reasons" would be viewed as a "significant and important 
humanitarian gesture." 
</P>
<P>
 The phrasing is important because the Clinton Administration has demanded that 
China show "significant, overall progress" on human rights before 
most-favored-nation trading status will be renewed for China this June. MFN 
status is considered essential for the two countries to continue their rapidly 
expanding trade relations. 
</P>
<P>
 But by showing the tapes and claiming all five men are in good health, the 
Chinese government appeared to be rejecting the "medical parole" option of 
satisfying American demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Convinced that the Administration does not have the political will to endanger 
$27 billion in trade to make a moral point, the Chinese, so far, are taking an 
aggressive stance in the face of U.S. demands for human rights reform. "The 
China World (a luxury Beijing hotel) is full of American businessmen," one 
senior Foreign Ministry official boasted earlier this week. "These friendly 
relations are something no force can stop." 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter addressed to Chinese President Jiang Zemin, the U.S. senators 
repeated claims by human rights organizations that the five leading dissidents 
are each suffering from a serious medical condition: 
</P>
<P>
 * Chen Ziming, 41, a think tank director sentenced in 1991 to a 13-year term 
on charges of conspiring to subvert the government, was said to be suffering 
from skin disease, high blood pressure and heart ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chen, accused by the government of being one of the "Black Hand" 
ringleaders of the 1989 movement, was shown in the video sharing a sumptuous 
meal that included plates of roast meat and seafood with his family. Wearing a 
burgundy pullover sweater, Chen -- at what officials said was Beijing No. 2 
Prison -- was flanked at the table by his wife and mother. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wang Juntao, 35, Chen Ziming's co-director at the Beijing Social and 
Economic Sciences Research Institute -- who is also serving a 13-year sentence 
-- reportedly suffers from hepatitis B and what human rights groups claim is a 
coronary condition. He smiled often as he was filmed in a small hospital room, 
equipped with a television set and decorated for the Chinese New Year holidays. 
With him on the tape, which officials said was made Feb. 10 at the Beijing 302 
military hospital, were his mother, older brother, sister and sister-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 * Civil rights activist Ren Wanding, 49, sentenced to seven years in prison on 
charges of engaging in counterrevolutionary propaganda, is said to be nearly 
blind and to suffer from intestinal, respiratory and back problems. He was 
shown, unsmiling, sharing an austere meal of fried fish and vegetables with his 
wife and daughter at the Beijing No. 2 Prison. 
</P>
<P>
 * Liu Gang, 32, a former physics student serving a six-year term for 
"conspiracy to overthrow the government," was shown with fellow inmates at 
Lingyuan Prison in Liaoning province celebrating what authorities said was his 
Jan. 30 birthday. Asia Watch, a human rights organization, has reported that 
Liu suffers from skin ailments, arthritis and intestinal, respiratory and back 
problems. But in several scenes, he was shown digging into a birthday cake, 
smoking and laughing with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Missing from the tapes was any sign of Bao Tong. Bao, 61, was the 
highest-ranking Chinese official jailed in the wake of the Tian An Men 
movement. Former chief aide to former Communist Party General Secretary Zhao 
Ziyang, Bao was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment on charges of divulging 
"state secrets." 
</P>
<P>
 An official with the Chinese State Council who presided over the video 
presentation said prison authorities did not permit the filming of Bao, of whom 
the official said, "I heard that his health conditions are always quite good."

SRI LANKANS GO TO POLLS IN EAST DESPITE TAMIL BOYCOTT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Boycotted by die-hard Tamil separatists as an army-scripted charade, municipal 
elections were held by Sri Lanka's government in the embattled east Tuesday for 
the first time in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The government aim was to prove that peace has been restored. More than 
750,000 voters were eligible to elect 40 local councils in the districts of 
Trincomalee, Batticaloa and Amparai on the island nation's eastern coast, along 
with the northern town of Vavuniya that was won back from the rebels three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports said more than 5,000 armed personnel were deployed to guard polling 
booths, but some observers saw their presence as a threat, not a safeguard. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way that this election can be fair because the security forces 
are intervening in a very direct way," one prominent human rights activist, a 
member of the ethnic Sinhalese majority, said by telephone from Colombo, the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have distributed leaflets at security checkpoints, and even at the stage 
of nomination there was police pressure on the people to enter the elections on 
behalf of various parties," said the observer, who asked not to be identified 
by name for fear of reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
 Most candidates were ethnic Sinhalese supporters of the government. The few 
Tamils running for election were members of former rebel factions now working 
with the country's army. 
</P>
<P>
 As election day approached, there had been accusations that security forces 
distributed pamphlets in favor of the ruling United National Party and rounded 
up Tamils to pressure them to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Another menace was posed by the Tamil Tiger militants who have been battling 
for a separate state for the ethnic minority that makes up 18% of Sri Lanka's 
17 million people. The rebels, who still hold much of the country's north, 
called on Tamils to stay away from the polls, and some feared that they would 
seek revenge on voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamils not voting ran the risk of being branded terrorist sympathizers by the 
army, so Tamil groups fielding candidates endorsed a strategy of spoiling the 
ballot papers to deny the Sinhalese-dominated UNP a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The elections for town and village councils, the first since the Tamil Tigers 
launched their independence struggle more than a decade ago, are being used to 
prove that the regime of President Dingiri Wijetunge has retaken sufficient 
control to restore elected local government in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 19,000 people are believed to have died in the fighting that has 
bloodied the lush island off India's tip. Last year, Wijetunge's predecessor, 
Ranasinghe Premadasa, was assassinated by a suspected suicide bomber. But 
gradually, the Sri Lankan army has retaken major coastal towns and roads in the 
east and pushed the guerrillas into the jungles. 
</P>
<P>
 Poll results were not expected before today, but government officials happily 
claimed Tuesday night that more than 60% of the electorate had ignored the 
boycott call and cast ballots. Now security forces can leave the pacified 
areas, they said.

ORDINANCE ON FIRE RESISTANCE VOTED DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday not to change the city's building 
codes -- at least for now -- to make most new homes more fire resistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they had too many unanswered questions and worried that 
this would prove an extra burden on the fire victims trying to rebuild their 
homes.The council sent a proposed ordinance back to the staff, the Planning 
Commission and the Design Review Board for more work. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, crafted by a task force formed after the Oct. 27 wildfire that 
destroyed or damaged more than 400 homes, had already been revised to assuage 
the fears of Canyon Acres residents who worried that their community would lose 
its rustic charm as homes are rebuilt. They argued those who couldn't afford 
the permitted materials might end up with less expensive options described as 
"concrete boxes and stucco boxes." 
</P>
<P>
 In response to such concerns, officials say the revised ordinance essentially 
would allow people to rebuild as they like as long as they're willing to pay 
the additional price for fire-retardant materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance would allow wood shake and shingle roofs, previously banned in 
hazardous fire areas, if they are properly treated for fire resistance. It also 
divides the city into special zones with the tightest requirements applying to 
areas that border wild lands. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents have said they may have trouble getting insurance if areas of 
the city are labeled as hazardous fire areas. City officials say they have 
taken steps to avoid such potentially damaging labels.

4 JEWISH STUDENTS WOUNDED IN BROOKLYN BRIDGE SHOOTING; ATTACK: TWO HASIDS ARE 
GRAVELY INJURED. MOTIVE IN ASSAULT ON UNMARKED VAN IS NOT KNOWN, BUT 
RETALIATION FOR WEST BANK MASSACRE IS FEARED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A van packed with Hasidic students was sprayed with gunfire Tuesday on the 
Brooklyn Bridge, gravely injuring two passengers and triggering a massive 
police investigation into whether the incident was politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other passengers were wounded in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, police indicated they believed the shooting was the result of a 
traffic dispute. But after it was revealed the van was attacked three times at 
the bridge, authorities did not dismiss the possibility that it was retaliation 
for the massacre of Palestinian worshipers by an extremist Jew in the occupied 
West Bank last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, that's something you can't exclude, and the speculation is there," 
said Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. He stressed, however, that there was no hard 
evidence at this point linking the shootings and the Mideast massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 "The driver of the vehicle (van) says there wasn't a traffic accident of any 
kind," said Chief of Detectives Joseph Borelli, and other top law enforcement 
officials added they did not believe a traffic argument had sparked the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis J. Freeh said they 
were monitoring the situation. The joint FBI/police Anti-Terrorist Task Force 
in New York City was called into the case. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the victims was not expected to live, and the prognosis for a second 
was highly uncertain, physicians at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A gunman opened fire from a blue car three separate times, shooting at least 
nine rounds into the white unmarked van carrying 14 to 16 Lubavitch Hasids in 
distinctive hats and side curls, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack on the van began at 10:24 a.m. The students were returning to 
Brooklyn from Manhattan, where they had gone to pray at a hospital in which the 
Lubavitcher's 91-year-old grand rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, had 
undergone cataract surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneerson was taken home by a different route, according to Lubavitcher 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the incident began just as the van was turning onto a ramp to the 
Brooklyn Bridge. At first, the van's driver stopped when he heard popping 
sounds and realized someone was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the students got out to inspect the van's shattered rear window. The 
assailant's car drove up and a second round was fired. The two students were 
uninjured, but "the driver of the van now realized he's being fired upon and he 
took off," Borelli said, leaving the two students on the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief of detectives said the blue car caught up with the van again in 
midspan, and the gunman resumed fire. When the van reached the Brooklyn end of 
the bridge, the driver notified a policeman on a motor scooter that he had been 
attacked. The bridge was closed for several hours after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The van had been struck at least five times. Nine 9-millimeter shell casings 
were recovered, and ballistics tests showed that they came from two different 
weapons, police spokesman John Miller said. Police still believe there was only 
one gunman, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they had no confirmed description of the attacker, and witnesses' 
descriptions were conflicting. 
</P>
<P>
 Giuliani labeled the shooting "horrible and outrageous . . . an attack on all 
New Yorkers." 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have here is a deliberate attempt to murder four men in a deliberate, 
wanton way," the mayor said. "We are trying to determine the motive." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Commissioner William Bratton said that on Monday, members of the 
Lubavitcher sect had reported to police the license plate of a car they 
believed was conducting surveillance of their activities. Detectives were 
trying to determine whether it was linked to the attack even though it was a 
different model than the dark blue car witnesses said was involved in the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the shooting victims, Aaron Halberstam, 20, had "tremendous brain 
injury" and his outlook was "very poor," said Dr. Jesse Blumenthal, chief of 
trauma at St. Vincent's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Nachum Sosonkin, 18, was in critical condition with a bullet in his brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other students, 17-year-old Yaakov Shapiro and 18-year-old Levi Wilhelm 
were listed in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack left the Hasidic teen-agers badly frightened, some in shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of young people, quite obviously traumatized," the police 
commissioner said.

U.S.-LOCAL PLAN UNVEILED TO CURB VIOLENT CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Warning that crime and the fear of crime "are tearing this country apart," 
Vice President Al Gore and other senior officials Tuesday unveiled a federal 
initiative to help states and local law enforcement agencies apprehend violent 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Meant to complement the sweeping crime bill that President Clinton is urging 
Congress to pass, the measure could significantly increase the federal 
government's role in prosecuting violent crimes -- a task for which local and 
state authorities have been primarily responsible in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore, appearing at a White House news conference with Atty. Gen. Janet Reno 
and FBI Director Louis J. Freeh, said that the Administration would offer local 
law enforcement officials federal resources and expertise to help them 
"proactively attack crime and root out the most serious criminals" in their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the Administration could take the necessary steps unilaterally, 
without need for legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno called it the beginning of a "true partnership between federal, state and 
local law enforcement agencies" to monitor the activities of gang members and 
other "career criminals" and prosecute them in both state and federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
 To make it work, she said, the Justice Department would create a Violent Crime 
Section staffed by federal prosectors with experience in convicting violent 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 The "violent crime response teams," as the groups of prosecutors will be 
known, will help communities that ask for assistance with prosecutions, Reno 
said. The FBI and the Drug Enforcement Agency, along with the Treasury 
Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, will give technical help 
and share information with local law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a pilot program in New Haven, Conn., where federal-state cooperation 
helped to break up a local street gang and lower the annual murder rate by 
one-third over the last year, Reno said that the initiative would "repeat New 
Haven's success across the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Together with the crime bill passed by the Senate but still awaiting action in 
the House, the "Anti-Violent Crime Enforcement Initiative" forms the core of 
the Clinton Administration's response to polls showing that Americans now 
regard violent crime as the nation's most serious problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno and other officials acknowledged that the initiative would involve no new 
financial resources. Instead, it will rely on a reallocation of existing funds, 
coupled with promises by various law enforcement agencies to set aside their 
frequent turf battles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a fancy proposal . . . (but) a brick and mortar proposal where we 
are putting things together. . . . What it involves is people working 
together," Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, cooperation between local police and DEA agents already has 
helped solve "a number of homicides," while federal resources have been used to 
help police track the movements of youth gangs in the Midwest, Reno said. She 
added that this kind of "sporadic" cooperation now will be done nationwide.

TROUBLESOME EL NINO OFFICIALLY GONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 El Nino -- the little kid who caused so much trouble -- is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Blamed for last year's unusually wet weather in Southern California, 
catastrophic floods in the Midwest and punishing droughts in Australia, the 
puzzling weather phenomenon named for an innocent child has finally come to an 
end, the National Weather Service says. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters say that should mean a gradual return to normal weather conditions 
-- good news for Laguna Beach, but even better news for Malibu, where residents 
learned the hard way last month that unusually heavy rains on slopes stripped 
of vegetation during last fall's brush fires could mean an onslaught of 
destructive mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that El Nino has ended," Alan Basist, a meteorologist with the 
National Weather Service's Climate Analysis Center in Silver Spring, Md., said 
Monday. "It apparently happened in December." 
</P>
<P>
 What occurred then, he said, is that equatorial trade winds in the southern 
Pacific resumed their customary strong flow from east to west. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a year -- and perhaps as long as three years -- these winds had 
been abnormally light, even flowing at times in the opposite direction, from 
west to east. Pushed by these unusual westerly winds, large bodies of warm 
water that normally circulate near Australia had drifted slowly east in what is 
called a Kelvin wave, pooling off the west coast of Peru. 
</P>
<P>
 Coastal residents called the phenomenon El Nino, naming it for the Christ 
child because the storms it spawned were first observed around Christmastime.

AMESES GOT $2.5 MILLION, PROMISE OF DACHA, OFFICIALS SAY; ESPIONAGE: PAPERS 
FILED IN COURT SPUR DENIAL OF BAIL FOR EX-CIA OFFICIAL AND HIS WIFE. U.S. AGENT 
ALSO SAYS CLASSIFIED CABLES, LETTER FOUND IN COUPLE'S HOME. 
</P>

<P>
 The Russians promised Aldrich H. Ames and his wife a riverside tract in Russia 
where a dacha could be built after their espionage career ended, besides paying 
the couple at least $2.5 million, U.S. officials said in federal court Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony, which came at a bond hearing for the Ameses, provided details 
suggesting that the couple was promised even greater riches for spying than had 
been reported earlier. An FBI supervisor testified at the hearing that Ames, a 
former CIA executive, and his wife, Rosario, had received twice the amount of 
any spy or spy network known to officials. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Magistrate Barry R. Poretz concluded the hearing by denying bail for the 
Ameses, ordering them held in federal custody indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, arrested on espionage conspiracy charges last week, had been 
brought into the hearing dressed in olive-drab prison clothing, with Aldrich 
Ames' shirt stenciled with prisoner in black. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing for denial of bail, Assistant U.S. Atty. Mark J. Hulkower declared: 
"They damaged national security and sold out their country for a lifestyle of 
luxury." 
</P>
<P>
 Ames, a 31-year veteran of the agency, served for two years as chief of the 
Soviet counterintelligence branch in the CIA's Soviet-East European division. 
He held that post, which gave him access to "nearly the crown jewels," as one 
former agency official put it, into 1985, when it is alleged he began spying 
for the then-Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the accusations, Ames left a rather clearly marked trail, for a 
veteran CIA official trained in counterintelligence, living well beyond his 
salary while his wife was a part-time student at Georgetown University. Ames 
bought a $540,000 house in Arlington, Va., for which real estate agents said he 
paid cash, and he drove a 1992 Jaguar, on which he made a $25,000 down payment. 
</P>
<P>
 His explanation for the sudden lavish living was that his wife came from a 
wealthy Colombian family. 
</P>
<P>
 In proceedings Tuesday, Leslie G. Wiser Jr., FBI supervising 
counterintelligence agent, referred to the $2.5 million the Ameses allegedly 
received in addition to the promise of Russian land. Wiser said that the amount 
was surprisingly high because the Russians "are notoriously thrifty with 
respect to payments to agents." 
</P>
<P>
 The case has led to calls in Congress for suspension of U.S. economic aid to 
the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Hulkower said that FBI agents had found more than 100 classified CIA cables on 
computer disks at the Ameses' house, a violation of agency regulations against 
keeping such material at home. Ames is believed to have provided the material 
to the Soviets starting in 1985, Hulkower said. 
</P>
<P>
 A nine-page letter found in Ames' study spelled out his Russian handlers' 
priorities, Wiser told the court. He said that the letter asked for information 
about CIA penetrations of the Soviet KGB and the Soviet military intelligence 
service, the GRU. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames received the letter while serving in Rome from 1986 to 1989 as a CIA 
operations officer assigned to recruit spies for the agency, Wiser testified. 
During that period, he said, Ames disclosed to the Russians the identity of an 
East European official, code-named "GT Motorboat," who was voluntarily giving 
him classified documents dealing with East European security matters. 
</P>
<P>
 GT Motorboat subsequently disappeared and "the CIA made many attempts to 
locate him without success," Wiser said. 
</P>
<P>
 At congressional briefings last week, FBI officials said in a "worst-case 
scenario" that Ames may have jeopardized the lives of 10 Russian agents working 
for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 39-page affidavit made public last week, the FBI said it had found 
evidence in Ames' computer records that in 1990 he exposed a Soviet 
counterintelligence officer who was secretly collaborating with the CIA. That 
agent was code-named "GT Prologue." 
</P>
<P>
 During Ames' years in Rome he opened three Swiss bank accounts through which 
more than $600,000 passed, Wiser said investigators have determined. Two were 
in his name and a third was in the name of Cecelia Dupuy, his mother-in-law in 
Colombia, Wiser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dupuy, interviewed recently by authorities, said that she signed a bank 
signature card at Ames' request but has never seen any financial records or 
conducted any transactions herself, Wiser told the court. 
</P>
<P>
 While hundreds of thousands of dollars in overseas funds eventually were 
transferred to bank accounts in the United States by Ames, at least $1 million 
believed to remain overseas has not been located, Hulkower said. All the funds 
in U.S. accounts have been frozen, Wiser testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames has steadfastly refused to answer any questions posed by the FBI, Wiser 
said. But Mrs. Ames volunteered a series of damaging statements to FBI agents 
before she was given a court-appointed lawyer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiser testified that Mrs. Ames first claimed that the couple's wealth grew out 
of investment help her husband had given to a friend in Chicago, but she later 
said that her husband had received millions of dollars from the Russians for 
spying. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that she discovered his espionage in 1991 and later cooperated in his 
efforts, Wiser said. He quoted her as saying that she often made cash deposits 
for her husband in amounts under $10,000, aware that banks must report to the 
government any cash deposit of $10,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Wiser, she also told agents that she accompanied her husband last 
September on a drive into Washington from their suburban Virginia home to look 
for a signal from his Russian handlers verifying that they had picked up a 
package of classified documents left for them at a so-called "dead drop." 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI, which began electronic and visual surveillance of the Ameses in May, 
had agents tailing the couple at the time.

OFFICERS TESTIFY DEFENDANT ADMITTED SHOOTING FLORIDA ABORTION DOCTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two police officers who were at the clinic where an abortion doctor was slain 
testified Tuesday that before they even knew anyone had been shot, the accused 
killer walked up and confessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Another witness testified that she saw the defendant, Michael F. Griffin, fire 
two of the fatal shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin, a 32-year-old anti-abortion activist, is accused of shooting Dr. 
David Gunn three times in the back on March 10. Gunn, 47, of Eufaula, Ala., was 
shot behind the Pensacola Women's Medical Services as he arrived for work while 
an anti-abortion demonstration was being held in front of the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Bernd Jablonski testified he was inside the clinic after responding to 
a complaint about the demonstration and did not hear the shots. He said after 
he went outside and met Sgt. Kenneth Franks, who had just arrived, Griffin 
walked up to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked at us and he said, 'I just shot someone behind the building,' " 
Jablonski testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Franks testified he went to the back of the building, found Gunn was still 
alive and called for an ambulance. Gunn died later that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Jablonski said after Franks confirmed someone had been shot, he read Griffin 
his rights, told him he was under arrest and asked who he had shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin replied, "David Gunn," Jablonski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Tuesday, Della Lindsey testified that she saw Griffin shoot Gunn. "I 
heard three pops. The first pop got my attention and then I saw the man 
shooting," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She identified Griffin in court, but said that at the time of the shooting she 
was about 200 feet away and was unable to see who his target was. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey, who worked at a shop in the same commercial complex as the clinic, is 
expected to be the only prosecution witness claiming actually to have seen the 
gun being fired.

HHS SAYS HEALTH PLAN MAY SAVE CALIFORNIA BILLIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN and KAREN TUMULTY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's health reform plan would be a financial boon to state 
governments and to employers and employees alike at companies already providing 
insurance to their workers, the Clinton Administration said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Health and Human Services Department said that California would be among 
those states that fare best, saving $6.5 billion through the year 2000 because 
of reduced Medicaid payments, a slowdown in health care inflation and a new 
federal grant program for long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
 California businesses that already provide insurance to workers would pay 
$11.9 billion less in premiums during that period, or 2.6% of payroll. Their 
employees would spend $3.3 billion less in premiums, or $298 per worker. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers mean "goods news to the nation's governors . . . (and) 
considerable savings to state governments as well as to workers and businesses 
in these states," said Kenneth E. Thorpe, deputy assistant health secretary for 
planning and evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is one catch. The projected savings assume congressional enactment 
of the President's controversial plan largely intact -- a long shot, at best. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, the savings would be substantial: $46 billion to state 
governments, $60 billion to employers that already provide insurance to their 
workers and $29 billion to their workers by the year 2000, the Administration 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's plan would require all employers to pay at least 80% of each 
employee's health premiums, with the individual picking up the rest. There 
would be federal subsidies on a sliding scale for low-income individuals as 
well as for small businesses with mostly low-wage workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, some companies and workers would be paying for insurance for the 
first time. Such workers, for example, would have to pay $9 billion, according 
to the Administration's estimates, leaving a net savings to all workers of $20 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 A study last month by the Urban Institute, a liberal Washington think tank, 
also concluded that state spending would decline in all states while federal 
spending would increase in most states. 
</P>
<P>
 And a Congressional Budget Office study in February said that corporate 
outlays in health spending would drop by about $20 billion by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Some states, most notably New York, have said that they would suffer 
financially as a result of the Clinton plan. But Thorpe said that the new study 
is more accurate because it is based on the latest available data. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the head of an influential private group that came up with the 
health care reform theory underpinning the Clinton plan told the Senate Finance 
Committee that the Clinton proposal seeks to accomplish too much too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Ellwood, president of the Jackson Hole Group, said that his loose-knit 
organization of health care experts and health industry executives had backed 
away from its original recommendations in light of uncertainty over how much 
that system would cost. 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting several days last week, the group is moving toward a more 
cautious approach, which would not bring about universal coverage within the 
five-year timetable favored by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is also abandoning its proposal -- similar to the one in the Clinton 
plan -- that would force most firms to join government-organized health care 
purchasing cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost question "has made me more conservative about how we should approach 
universal coverage," Ellwood said.

EX-L.A. HOUSING DIRECTOR ENTERS CONTROLLER RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kathleen Connell, a Westside financial consultant and former Los Angeles city 
housing director, declared her candidacy Tuesday for the Democratic nomination 
for state controller. 
</P>
<P>
 Connell, 47, portrayed herself in her announcement as an outsider who would 
challenge the spending of every state dollar to make sure nothing was wasted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired of reading about government officials abusing the system and 
wasting our money and of contractors cheating the system and collecting more 
than they're due," she said in a speech at Glendale Community College. 
</P>
<P>
 She chose for the announcement the college's computer training program that 
helps students prepare for jobs in high-technology industries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our community college curriculum must be strengthened to reflect the needs of 
our industries who are, and will be, in a position to hire," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Connell then went to Sacramento and San Francisco to repeat her announcement 
declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 Connell is the fourth Democrat to enter the race to succeed Democrat Gray 
Davis, who is running for lieutenant governor. Others are Assemblyman Rusty 
Arieas of San Jose, Alameda County Supervisor Don Peralta and Brad Sherman, 
chairman of the State Board of Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican candidates are former Assemblyman Tom McClintock and John Morris, 
heir to a department store fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Connell holds a master's degree in urban planning and a Ph.D. in finance from 
UCLA. She is a former bank vice president and has taught at UCLA and UC 
Berkeley. She was Los Angeles city director of housing under Mayor Tom Bradley 
from 1977 to 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, Connell founded her consulting company. Her firm provides 
financial and investment advice to local governments including the cities of 
Santa Monica, Los Angeles and San Diego, some California counties and special 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Connell's first campaign for elected office. By the end of last year, 
she had nearly $600,000 on hand to finance her campaign and raised more in a 
mid-February reception at the Century Plaza Hotel.

U.S. SANCTIONS STATE WELFARE EXPERIMENT; ASSISTANCE: CALIFORNIA PLAN SEEKS TO 
ENCOURAGE YOUNG MOTHERS RECEIVING AID TO STICK WITH SCHOOLING AND OLDER ONES TO 
GET JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration agreed Tuesday to let California experiment with 
new welfare rules designed to encourage school-age welfare mothers to stick 
with their education and older recipients to get jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Called the "work pays demonstration," the California experiment seeks to 
promote self-sufficiency for recipients of Aid to Families With Dependent 
Children. 
</P>
<P>
 "A key aspect of the California demonstration is to encourage young AFDC 
recipients to stay in school or work," said Health and Human Services Secretary 
Donna Shalala. "We will continue to work with California and other states to 
test ways that recipients can achieve self-sufficiency." 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, a Wilson Administration spokeswoman said state officials were 
"thrilled" that Clinton had approved the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope this signals a willingness on the part of the Clinton Administration 
to allow us to continue to experiment with these kinds of changes," said Amy 
Albright, spokeswoman for the state Department of Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rules will allow AFDC families to accumulate $2,000 in assets and have 
$4,500 equity in an automobile. Under current law, the asset limit is $1,000, 
plus $1,500 for a car. 
</P>
<P>
 AFDC recipients in the California program also will be allowed to deposit up 
to $5,000 in savings as long as the money is used to purchase a home, start a 
business or finance a child's post-secondary education or training. 
</P>
<P>
 Recipients who work but have low AFDC benefits can opt out of the program and 
remain eligible for health care under Medi-Cal and other services, such as 
child care, which are available to other AFDC recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the school provisions, teen-age parents on AFDC who maintain at least a 
C grade average or graduate from high school will be eligible to receive cash 
bonuses of $100 and $500, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who fail to maintain a D average could have their monthly AFDC 
benefits reduced by up to $50 for each of two months. 
</P>
<P>
 The California rules were part of an overhaul of the welfare program adopted 
last year by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Pete Wilson. Democrats rejected 
the Republican governor's call for harsher sanctions that would have curtailed 
higher benefits granted to women who have additional children while on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and lawmakers who advocated the changes argued that the old rules 
discouraged savings and punished welfare recipients who got jobs by denying 
them subsidized health care and child care.

ATM FRAUD SUSPECT ARRESTED IN FULLERTON

<P>
 Quick thinking by a bank customer who flagged down police after seeing someone 
loitering near an automated teller machine led to the arrest of a man suspected 
of being part of an ATM fraud ring, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Shimon Levi, 29, was arrested without incident Monday night after police 
discovered him carrying a handgun outside the Bank of America at 1831 W. 
Orangethorpe Ave., said Fullerton Police Lt. Tony Hernandez.

 Officers who searched Levi's car found more than 200 counterfeit ATM cards, 
$4,200 in $20 bills and a list of bank account numbers, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Levi "had a large map of Orange County laying out 18 other locations of Bank 
of Americas," Hernandez said. "It looked like he was just getting started for 
the evening and had made all of the withdrawals out of the ATM machine at this 
bank." 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe Levi is part of a ring targeting Bank of America customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Levi, a resident of West Hills, was being held Tuesday at the Federal 
Detention Center in Los Angeles on suspicion of forgery, fraudulent use of 
credit cards and possession of a loaded handgun, Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the ring uses receipts left behind at ATMs to obtain customers' 
account numbers and surveillance to obtain their personal identification 
number, or PIN. The ring apparently manufactures phony ATM cards and encodes 
their magnetic strips with filched account numbers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ring will either videotape or use binoculars or telescopes to watch 
people put their (PIN) numbers into the machines," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second time in a month that police in Orange County have arrested 
people in connection with an ATM card scam. On Feb. 9, Newport Beach police 
arrested three men and charged them in a scheme that may have netted $100,000 
in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, police seized 500 automated teller machine cards, magnetic 
strips for altering the cards, a telescope, $20,000 in cash and two firearms. 
The three men are in custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los 
Angeles awaiting arraignment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Both cases were turned over by police to the U.S. Secret Service, which 
investigates the counterfeiting of credit cards, a federal offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal investigators would not comment on the case. Police said they did not 
know if the two Orange County cases are linked or if they are connected to a 
major ATM ring in the San Fernando Valley.

NOT TO WORRY, COACH: BURROUGHS, MINUS TWO KEY STARTERS, ADVANCES TO FINAL, 2-0; 
DIVISION III SOCCER: KODAMA'S FEARS ALLAYED AS INDIANS OVERCOME PHYSICAL 
BREA-OLINDA.

<P>
 Burroughs soccer Coach Michael Kodama had good reason to be concerned before 
Tuesday's Southern Section Division III semifinal match against Brea-Olinda. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians were without two starters and were facing a big and physical 
team.Senior midfielder Anthony Perico broke a leg in the quarterfinals last 
Thursday and senior defender Juan Almaguer hurt an ankle a couple of days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Indians (15-6-2) still managed to pull out a 2-0 victory and advance 
to championship match on Saturday against Bell Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played real calm," Kodama said. "The key for us was to keep the ball on 
the ground and we did that." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior David Ramos scored the Indians' first goal at the 29-minute mark on a 
header after a throw-in by senior Eddie Melgar. Senior forward Roberto Perez 
scored the insurance goal on a breakaway after 57 minutes 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, the Foothill League player of the year, had a difficult time in the 
first half, getting off only three long shots.  
</P>
<P>
 "Things just weren't working out for me at first," Perez said. "I really don't 
know what it was because I felt good." 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams took six shots and Burroughs goalie Marc Binda had five saves. Brea 
goalie Justin Breazeale had two. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started the game off at 90% in the first half and we came out at 150% in 
the second but it was too late," said Coach Matt Swindle of Brea-Olinda 
(18-5-3). "We just weren't applying the pressure."

ALEMANY BACK WHERE IT BELONGS; DIVISION II-A: INDIANS ADVANCE TO CHAMPIONSHIP 
GAME FOR THIRD CONSECUTIVE SEASON AFTER ROUTING VENTURA, 69-40. 
</P>

<P>
 Ho-hum. Another day, another playoff blowout by the Alemany High girls' 
basketball team.  
</P>
<P>
 Another year, another Southern Section final. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians trounced their fourth consecutive playoff opponent, defeating 
Ventura, 69-40, Tuesday night in a Southern Section Division II-A semifinal at 
Crespi. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany (27-0) will play San Bernardino for the championship Saturday at 
Pomona College. It is the third consecutive year that Alemany has advanced to a 
section final -- every season for third-year starters Samantha Rigley, Kelly 
McKay and Zevette Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't know any different," Alemany Coach Melissa Hearlihy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprising, considering this team's talent, which was on full display 
against the Cougars (21-6). 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians jumped to a 20-4 lead in the first quarter, behind seven points 
from Rigley and six by McKay. 
</P>
<P>
 McKay also held Ventura's standout forward Ember Brown to four first-half 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she took Ember completely out of her game," Alemany center Carly 
Funicello said. 
</P>
<P>
 Funicello took Ventura completely out of the game in the third quarter, after 
the Cougars trimmed the lead to 36-25.  
</P>
<P>
 Funicello, a 6-foot-3 sophomore, scored 11 points -- including five layups -- 
in the final five minutes of the quarter, and the Indians extended their lead 
to 51-31. 
</P>
<P>
 Funicello finished with 23 points, 14 rebounds and five blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty frustrating for me because I have to play down there," said the 
5-8 Brown. "There's nothing I could do except watch her score. I wish I could 
jump up there and swat her." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown finished with 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat ended a fine playoff run by Ventura in which the Cougars defeated 
Westlake, Muir and Hacienda Heights Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played a lot better in those games," Brown said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We really deeply believed that if we played tonight the way we were playing 
we could have beaten them. But we weren't ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura Coach Glenn Gray didn't see it exactly that way. "We lost to a 
better team," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth-ranked team in the state, to be precise, and one that has defeated 
its last three opponents by an average of 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigley had 20 points and four assists and McKay added 12 points, four assists 
and four steals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically it was a great team effort," Funicello said. 
</P>
<P>
 So how does it feel to be back in the section final? 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's all over, we'll determine what the winning means," Hearlihy said. 
"I can't even talk about CIF right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Ho-hum.

WITHOUT AN OFFENSE, HARVARD-WESTLAKE HAS NO KICK COMING IN OVERTIME DEFEAT; 
DIVISION III SOCCER: WOLVERINES, WITH TWO BEST PLAYERS OUT, FALL TO BELL 
GARDENS, 1-0. 
</P>

<P>
 After its 1-0 overtime loss to Bell Gardens High, the Harvard-Westlake boys' 
soccer team can't say it didn't have its chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it could say exactly that. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines, playing without two of their best players, could not create 
any dangerous scoring opportunities in the Southern Section Division III 
semifinal Tuesday at Harvard-Westlake, and Bell Gardens finally scored the 
game's lone goal in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard-Westlake finished the season 20-2-1. Bell Gardens improved to 20-5-3 
and will face Burroughs in the championship match Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Without junior midfielders Brian Angelini (out for receiving two yellow cards 
in the previous match) and Warren Davidoff (sprained ankle), Harvard-Westlake's 
offense lacked spark and creativity. 
</P>
<P>
 But the defense was solid, continually shutting down the Lancer attack, until 
a lapse in the fifth minute of the first overtime period. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancer defender Gustavo Garita took a pass after a free kick, controlled it 
with his chest, then turned and fired a shot past Wolverine goalkeeper Jay 
Rosen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just really disappointing," Harvard-Westlake forward Jordan Elias said. 
"I felt that we were a better team. I don't want to make excuses, but when they 
scored, four of our normal starters weren't on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 It was left for the offense to desperately try to manufacture a goal, and it 
could not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those guys (Angelini and Davidoff) know how to play the ball out of the 
midfield," Elias said. "Without them, we lose a little cohesion."

SNODGRASS RESCUES VIKINGS; DIVISION V-AA: ROLE PLAYER'S HUSTLE HELPS FALTERING 
CAMPBELL HALL HOLD OFF BRENTWOOD IN FINAL QUARTER, 62-60. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Jim Snodgrass was an unlikely hero for Campbell Hall High in its Southern 
Section Division V-AA semifinal game Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Snodgrass scored only four points but when the Vikings lost an eight-point 
lead in the final quarter and seemed to be falling apart, it was Snodgrass' 
hustle which enabled Campbell Hall to escape with a 62-60 victory over Delphic 
League rival Brentwood before a standing-room-only crowd at Harvard-Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell Hall will play Pasadena Poly in the championship game Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 58-58, and less than a minute to play, Snodgrass stole a 
pass from Eagle guard George Washington, drove downcourt and fed Simeon 
Woodall, who scored with 22 seconds left to give the Vikings the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been a role player all year doing those things," Snodgrass said. "I let 
the other guys to the scoring."  
</P>
<P>
 After Woodall (18 points) and Brentwood's Teddy Miller (29) traded free 
throws, the Eagles had one last chance, but Miller's 10-foot baseline shot 
bounced off the rim and Sebastian Saylor's follow missed before Viking center 
Alex Lopez tipped the ball out to midcourt as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Brentwood put itself in a position to win by using a trapping defense, causing 
seven fourth-quarter turnovers. When Campbell Hall didn't give up the ball, it 
shot an astounding 70% (23-33) from the field.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the turnovers came on passes to Lopez, who was double-teamed in the 
fourth quarter after scoring 21 points on nine-of-10 shooting. Lopez was held 
scoreless in the final period. The Vikings as took only four shots in the final 
eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the team to try to play to win, not hold back and wind up losing," 
Campbell Hall Coach Jon Palarz said. "I think they tried to go for the 
spectacular play when it wasn't there." 
</P>
<P>
 Snodgrass also helped get Brentwood's Kareem Abdul-Jabbar into foul trouble. 
Brentwood's leading scorer fouled out with 2:33 left, having scored only nine 
points.  
</P>
<P>
 Campbell Hall (20-8) started fast, thanks to a strong shooting performance by 
shooting guard Harold Sylvester. Sylvester scored 10 of his 16 points in the 
first quarter as the Vikings took an early advantage, leading by as many as 11 
points early in the second half.

 WEEK AT A GLANCE: Nuesca, a midfielder, scored three goals in La Reina's two 
playoff victories, and in the process became the school's all-time leading 
scorer.The four-year starter scored both goals in the Regents' 2-0 quarterfinal 
victory over Marlborough last Thursday. That gave her 86 in her career and 
broke the record of 84 set last season by Jaimie Armstrong. An unselfish 
player, Nuesca also has 64 assists, a school record. "She's excellent," Coach 
Joe Laraneta said. "She plays side to side, goal to goal and plays as hard 
defensively as she does offensively."

IN DISNEY POLL, WORKERS SAY PARK QUALITY ON THE DECLINE; ENTERTAINMENT: SEVEN 
OUT OF 10 EMPLOYEES RATE DISNEYLAND AN "ABOVE AVERAGE" PLACE TO WORK. MOST TAKE 
PRIDE IN COMPANY, BUT SAY IT'S TOO WORRIED ABOUT PROFIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first comprehensive survey of Disneyland employees in seven years found 
that nearly half believe that the park's quality has declined and that guests 
aren't being treated as well as in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney workers say their pay could be better, that management talks about 
quality but doesn't always make it a day-to-day priority, and that the company 
puts too much emphasis on profits. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than seven out of every 10 "cast members" rated Disneyland as an 
"above-average" place to work and said they take tremendous pride in working at 
"the Happiest Place on Earth." A similar majority praises their health 
insurance and other benefits and they laud management for its willingness to 
risk failure and try new things. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey of nearly 7,000 employees, representing 68% of the park's work 
force, was conducted last October. Commissioned by Disney, the survey was 
conducted by the Hay Group, a management consulting outfit based in 
Philadelphia, and elicited hundreds of comments on how employees -- from 
dishwashers to vice presidents -- view the park, their pay and their bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 Key findings have been presented to employees since January by Edmund Pinelli, 
a senior consultant in Hay's Atlanta office. Hay has conducted similar surveys 
for the Walt Disney World resort in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinelli said Tuesday that Disney employees "are not only proud of their jobs, 
they are (so) proud of the organization" that their overall ratings are "off 
the charts" in terms of employee satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the findings of the survey don't necessarily reflect truth -- only 
employees' impressions. Those impressions, however, count for a lot -- 
Disneyland officials said they will make improvements based on the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives us very valuable information and that's the mark of a (well) managed 
company," said Judson C. Green, president of Walt Disney Co.'s theme park 
division, when contacted Tuesday for comment. "I found all the results very 
useful." He declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's biggest challenge in responding to the report will likely be in 
determining how to reverse the perception that its vaunted levels of quality 
and courtesy are declining.  
</P>
<P>
 When asked how Disneyland compares to "a few years ago," employees replied 
that it had gotten worse at far higher rates than is generally found in other 
companies nationally, including those in the service industry, according to the 
Hay Group. 
</P>
<P>
 The park's 30 vice presidents and top managers also thought there has been a 
quality decline: 50% said the park was not as good, 35% said it it is better 
and the rest said it was about the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Though employees overwhelmingly give the Anaheim theme park high marks for 
guest courtesy, they say levels have deteriorated. Of all worker groups 
surveyed, clerical employees were the most positive about guest courtesy, and 
only 17% of them said it had improved. 
</P>
<P>
 While Disneyland's quality is perceived by many as having declined, most 
workers say that quality of the adjoining Disneyland Hotel has increased. The 
1,131-room hotel is considered to have deteriorated in its last years under its 
original owners, the Wrather Corp. It was bought by Disney in 1988, and 
extensively renovated. 
</P>
<P>
 No explanation is given by Hay and Disney about why workers feel Disneyland's 
quality has declined. However, many of the hundreds of employee written 
comments included in three phone-book sized volumes stated that too much 
emphasis is being put on profits. 
</P>
<P>
 The finding also shows up in one of the survey questions. When all employees 
were asked to rank what they believe were management's top concerns, 
profitability came in first. Nine out of 10 employees said management is "very 
concerned" about profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Other top company concerns were believed to be improving courtesy, enhancing 
the quality of rides and attractions, operating efficiency and making sure 
patrons have a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 As for their own situation, more than eight in 10 employees say they have 
pride in their jobs -- a figure that Pinelli said is "remarkable" and 
substantially higher than in other companies nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Most workers believe their efforts contribute to the success of the park, said 
they would come to work at Disneyland if they could do it all over again and 
believe they have high job security. On Monday, Disney dismissed 60 employees, 
less than 1% of its work force, its first non-seasonal layoffs in about two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two-thirds of Disney workers say their pay is "average" or "poor." 
Only about one-third of the more than 4,900 hourly workers who participated in 
the survey rated their pay as "good," with the rest saying it is average or 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
 When benefits are thrown in, and compensation is viewed as a package, most say 
they are pleased overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Most low-level workers say they generally have no chance to learn new skills, 
that their ideas are overlooked and that they have little latitude over how to 
do their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Keefe, president of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union Local 681, 
which represents more than 1,700 Disneyland park and hotel workers, said the 
findings of the survey do not surprise her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our members are very proud to work for Disneyland," she said. But "the fact 
that they work for a multibillion-dollar company and make the wages they do is 
always an issue." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent contract with the hotel, for instance, gave maids a wage of $6.81 an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the best-paid housekeeping job in Orange County, but it is nothing 
compared to the profits they pull out of that hotel and still leaves many below 
the poverty line," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey also found that Disneyland employees wish they had better 
communication with top executives.  
</P>
<P>
 Half say they depend on newspapers and the radio for news about Disneyland -- 
information they wish they could have heard directly from their employer.

PAPER-LESS PUBLISHER; COMPUTERS: IRVINE 'INFOMANIAC'S' 'E-MAGAZINE' EXISTS ONLY 
IN CYBERSPACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 David Scott Lewis calls himself an "infomaniac." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1975, when he was 17, he built a personal computer from the first available 
Altair kits. He became a "hacker" and served as a consultant to "WarGames," a 
1983 film about a teen-age computer nerd who nearly triggers a nuclear war. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the 35-year-old Lewis cruises the Internet, the global electronic 
supernetwork known simply as "the Net" that links 20,000 computer networks and 
boasts 20 million users. He spends an hour or more a day perusing more than 200 
groups of on-line information. He even acquired an Internet address -- a sort 
of ID number -- for his 19-week-old daughter on the day she was born. 
</P>
<P>
 So naturally, this walking encyclopedia and information junkie is a fitting 
editor and publisher of an Internet magazine, Hot Off The Tree, which 
summarizes more than 100 printed publications and explores our technological 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 His "publication" circulates electronically -- only in cyberspace -- and is a 
sign of the coming grass-roots explosion in the electronic publishing world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Internet may be as important to publishing as the Gutenberg 
printing press," he said. "It means that anybody can be a publisher, as long as 
they understand the Internet. I haven't spent a nickel and I'm putting out an 
international magazine and rounding up tens of thousands of subscribers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis got the urge to start a free electronic magazine to track the hottest 
and the worst technologies after reading a 1992 NASA-Pentagon report that 
suggested techies might prefer reading on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ted Turner and Rupert Murdoch, watch out," Lewis jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Jurist, a visual arts librarian at UC San Diego, published Hot Off The 
Tree for about a year before it became too much of a burden. She had 2,000 
subscribers when she halted publication last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Lewis asked if he could take it over, and she agreed. UCSD 
officials agreed to maintain the mailing list in the beginning for his first 
few issues, which will not carry advertising. Lewis intends to publish and edit 
HOTT about 10 times a year in his spare time from his home in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis has taken steps to dramatically boost HOTT's circulation. He sent a mass 
solicitation to various Internet user groups in January and included the text 
of the speech by AT&T executive Robert Kavner at the recent Consumer 
Electronics Show in Las Vegas. A direct mailing on paper could have cost him at 
least $45,000, but providing the same information on the Internet cost nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 After less than two months, more than 31,000 people sent Lewis messages saying 
they wanted to subscribe to HOTT, which he calls the "first periodical for the 
global citizenry in cyberspace." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' electronic magazine venture is expected to cost him less than $5,000. 
Loading the magazine onto the Internet costs nothing more than getting an 
Internet address, which he has for free thanks to his work over the past seven 
years as an editor of a quarterly journal for the Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once Lewis completes an issue, he sends it to an Internet host computer in San 
Jose, which transmits it to a computer system at UC San Diego, where the 
mailing list is kept. Then the university transmits it worldwide to everyone on 
the list. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could do this from a ski slope in Wyoming as long as I had access to a 
computer and modem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathryn McCabe, editor-in-chief of Online Access, a printed magazine that 
covers electronic bulletin boards, said her journal keeps track of 150 
electronic magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 Most electronic journals, ranging from Computer Underground Digest to AIDS 
Treatment News, hit a focused readership and compete only with printed trade 
journals of limited circulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he has 31,000 people, that is successful," said McCabe, "These things have 
taken off on the Internet because the economics are so much better when you 
don't have to print on paper." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' magazine should also draw additional readers because it will be posted 
for viewing on a variety of computer networks within the Internet, including an 
Air Force network and numerous overseas networks. Lewis has received hundreds 
of electronic letters asking for subscriptions, from a Russian scientist 
working at the University of Sains in Malaysia to academics in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for an electronic magazine that will resume publishing later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult to determine how many people actually read an on-line magazine 
and even to define what one is, said Daniel Dern, author of the Internet Guide 
for New Users and outgoing editor of Internet World magazine in Newton Center, 
Mass.  
</P>
<P>
 "What Mr. Lewis is doing with HOTT is exciting in itself and also as a 
demonstration of how to reach a large audience on-line," said Dern. "It really 
is experimental." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The timing for these "e-zines" couldn't be better. With the growing popularity 
of the information superhighway, the general media have published more than 
2,000 articles on the 'Net. How-to books for Internet novices proliferate. 
Lewis believes his magazine will become must reading among the 2.5 million 
serious 'Net users like himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've hit upon a publishing phenomenon," said Rosalind Resnick, a Hollywood, 
Fla., resident who monitors electronic newspapers and magazines and started her 
own Internet publication, the Interactive Publishing Alert, this month. "After 
sending out e-mail, I got my first paying subscriber in seven hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said he will keep his full-time job while working as editor, publisher 
and sole employee of HOTT. Since January, he has been president of Cellsys 
Inc., a start-up Van Nuys company that is creating wireless communications 
products, such as radio-controlled home appliances. Previously, he worked for 
eight years as a marketing executive for a factory automation firm in Irvine, 
Noubas.  
</P>
<P>
 His bookshelf includes "fun" titles such as "Neurocomputing," "Virtual Reality 
Systems," "Silicon Valley Fever," "Numerical Analysis," and "Technological 
Forecasting for Decision Making." 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone can pull this off, David can," said Ira Moskatel, a high-tech 
attorney in Century City who has known Lewis for nine years. "He's a walking 
encyclopedia." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Lasker, who co-wrote the screenplay for "WarGames," said Lewis has a 
talent for making technological subjects understandable to novices. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a hacker, you could tell he knew his way around," Lasker said. "He was an 
incredibly fast reader. He was always motivated to find information if he 
didn't have it." 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Roberts, a professor of management information at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, said Lewis clearly has the energy to be successful 
with HOTT. "He has a craze for scanning information and cramming it into his 
head and putting it together into tidbits." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis boils down newspaper articles from about 100 newspapers and trade 
journals into summaries because most busy users don't want the entire story as 
long as they know where to find the full text.  
</P>
<P>
 Summaries can be useful because the Internet is more like an ocean of 
information, where it is difficult to find things, than a highway. Lewis said 
he doesn't have to pay royalties to publications as long as he gives proper 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its combination academic and "cyberpunk" outlaw roots, commercial 
advertising on the Internet often draws the wrath of users fond of "flaming." 
Because messages on the 'Net go uncensored, users often unload curses and 
vitriol on the advertising sponsor.  
</P>
<P>
 But Lewis believes users will accept tasteful ads in the form of promotional 
stories known as "advertorials," which in HOTT will take the form of 
perspectives from computer company chief executives, helpful hints, or new 
product announcements. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market will speak," said Dern. "It's hard to know what the reaction will 
be and it depends on how it's done." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis says HOTT will have eight times as much news in it as ads. Once the 
circulation hits 50,000, Lewis said he will seek sponsors who would be charged 
somewhere between $2,000 and $3,500 per screen of advertorial. A few sponsors 
have already approached him. 
</P>
<P>
 Since HOTT is targeting the heaviest users of the Internet, Lewis believes 
advertisers will pay dearly to reach them.  
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to make good money as the circulation goes up," Lewis said. "Although 
I'm not sure if it's more of an adventure or a venture." Hot Off The Tree

'RISING STAR' THREADS 4 LIFE FORCED TO SELL ITS OPERATIONS; APPAREL: DEBT AND 
TOO-RAPID EXPANSION LEAD MAKER OF CROSS COLOURS TO RESTRUCTURE. TRADEMARK MAY 
ALSO BE SOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The company that produces the popular Cross Colours line of clothing, once one 
of the fastest-growing black-owned companies in the nation, has been forced to 
sell all of its manufacturing operations, the founder said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 City of Commerce-based Threads 4 Life, which incurred heavy debt to finance a 
rapid expansion, has sold its manufacturing operations to cope with mounting 
financial difficulties and is being restructured, said Carl Jones, the 
company's chairman and founder. He would not disclose who the buyer is. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said the company will withdraw from manufacturing and is considering 
selling its trademark to Skechers, a Manhattan Beach footwear producer headed 
by Michael Greenberg. Skechers has been producing footwear for Threads 4 Life. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said he expects to continue designing clothing for the Cross Colours 
line and is currently negotiating with Greenberg, who may assume some business 
management tasks for the clothing line.  
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg, son of the founder of L.A. Gear, was not available for comment 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Threads 4 Life included two major clothing lines, Cross Colours and Karl Kani. 
Designer Karl Kani said Tuesday he established his own company last month and 
has struck an agreement with Skechers and another manufacturer, Kass & Co., to 
produce and distribute clothing for his firm, Karl Kani Infinity.  
</P>
<P>
 Threads 4 Life had been a rising star in the apparel industry, but Jones, his 
business associates and industry observers said the small company became 
unmanageable, mostly because it rose so fast and to such great heights. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's boldly colored denim jeans and jackets, hooded sweat shirts and 
T-shirts were extremely popular with the hip-hop set.  
</P>
<P>
 The Cross Colours line was an immediate hit with young African Americans. It 
posted $15 million in sales for 1991, its first full year of operation. Its 
appeal spread, and sales reportedly reached nearly $90 million in 1992 and $160 
million in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 Threads was Black Enterprise magazine's "Company of the Year" in 1993. It 
received the "Rising Star" award from the California Mart, the Los Angeles 
apparel showcase center, in 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 However, rapidly rising demand created problems, Jones said. "Demand was 
overwhelming," he said. "The growing pains forced us into restructuring. We 
weren't ready for what happened to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Kani said the company sometimes did not have the money to expand enough to 
fill its orders. "The company grew fast -- so fast -- that the management 
couldn't keep pace," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Threads 4 Life's financial woes are not unusual in the competitive fashion 
field, especially among relatively small companies aiming for the youth market, 
said Alan G. Millstein, who edits New York-based Fashion Network Report. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a very hot run with fad merchandise for about two years," Millstein 
said. "But then the slings and arrows of outrageous fashion nailed them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just the nature of the youth fashion market," Millstein said. "The youth 
market bankrupted Merry-Go-Round (a Joppa, Md.-based retail chain). That's the 
tough part of dealing with the (ages) 14-to-22 market." 
</P>
<P>
 Threads 4 Life's problems won't necessarily hurt the Cross Colours line if 
good licensees pick up the lines and ship attractive products to retailers, 
Millstein said. "I don't think consumers really know or care who the real owner 
is," Millstein said. "What they know is what they buy in the stores."

JAMES FLANIGAN: THE ECONOMY: NEW FEARS OVER INFLATION; GREENSPAN USES GOLD AS 
HEDGE FOR FUTURE INTEREST RATE HIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite strange talk by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, the 
price of gold doesn't have much, if anything, to do with the U.S. economy, or 
with the rate of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's a mystery why the Fed chairman told Congress in testimony last week 
that gold "has shown a consistent lead on inflation expectations and has been 
over the years a reasonably good indicator of inflation." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the record of the last decade shows no such thing. While U.S. 
inflation in the 1980s averaged 4.7% a year, the price of gold seesawed 
violently and declined 3.4% a year on average. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did Greenspan, who knows that record, declare that he uses the gold price 
as a guide in making interest rate policy? Fed chairmen don't explain their 
statements, but it just may be that Greenspan is using gold as a stalking 
horse, a handy cover allowing him to exert a moderating influence on the 
strengthening economy. To that end, he's been using small hikes in short-term 
interest rates and a lot of scare talk about gold and industrial commodities, 
such as nickel, aluminum and copper. 
</P>
<P>
 Some price inflation is showing up in those commodities, the National Assn. of 
Purchasing Management reported Tuesday. But even there, professional "hedge 
funds" pouring vast pools of investment into commodities may be distorting the 
markets. To the extent that speculative buying of commodity futures, rather 
than real industrial demand, has pushed up metals prices, those prices are 
subject to downdraft.  
</P>
<P>
 In other words, there may be less than meets the eye in inflation statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 What really is happening with gold is that there is an increased worldwide 
demand for it in jewelry, especially in developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewelry demand has risen to more than 80 million ounces, from 27 million a 
decade ago. Global consumption has outrun new gold production for the last four 
years, with the shortfall being made up from gold scrap, sales by central banks 
and other means. Yet there seems to be no shortage of the yellow metal.  
</P>
<P>
 Through most of the unprecedented rise in jewelry demand, the price of gold 
has been declining. Even today, with production all but shut down in the former 
Soviet Union, the price remains less than $400 an ounce. Leading analyst Ian 
MacDonald of Credit Suisse doesn't expect gold to "go screaming up." But he 
does predict it will go above $400, from about $382 now. 
</P>
<P>
 The story on gold these days, unlike in the 1970s, has little to do with 
hedging against U.S. inflation and a lot to do with purchases of jewelry in 
China, says analyst Vahid Fathi of Kemper Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 There is new wealth in a rapidly growing economy in China and a desire to buy 
something that might hold its value amid inflation running 15% a year. Chinese 
purchases now account for almost 14% of global jewelry sales.  
</P>
<P>
 The tradition in India is that even poor farmers buy gold jewelry for dowries. 
Now there is more cash circulating in India's economy and farmers are buying 
more jewelry. That reflection of rising living standards is occurring in many 
developing countries, where people have always valued gold for its stability.  
</P>
<P>
 In Turkey, a gold exchange has opened in Istanbul to draw hoarded gold out of 
households and into circulation, boosting the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, gold fever in Shanghai and Bombay has little to do with the U.S. 
economy. Even the gold jewelry sold there is different from the trinkets in 
U.S. stores. Bracelets and rings typically are 24-karat, pure gold and priced 
on their gold content.  
</P>
<P>
 But in U.S. jewelry stores, the price of 14-karat bracelets and rings reflects 
the jeweler's art and the merchant's markup; it is far beyond the gold value. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, gold is not much of an investment, paying no interest or dividends and 
as likely to fall in value as go up. Investment manager Kenneth Fisher of 
Fisher Investments in Woodside, Calif., predicts a long downward trend for 
gold's price, based on increased production and a leveling off in demand. He is 
also skeptical of most high-flying metals prices, reckoning that inflation 
pressures will remain low in a world where economic efficiency is improving. 
</P>
<P>
 And the possibility that gold might fall is a further hint that Greenspan sees 
it as a useful scapegoat for action he may have to take to control the economy. 
If the price of gold goes up, the Fed chairman can use that fact as an excuse 
to raise short-term interest rates. If it goes down, that may persuade the 
markets to bring bond rates back down gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan's motive is clear and commendable: He wants to prevent inflation 
from seeping into the economy and influencing wages, cost-of-living adjustments 
for Medicare and labor union contracts and the assumptions businesses make 
about investment returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation, like carbon monoxide, is insidious and deadly. Global investors 
have been jumpy lately because they detect something in the air. That's why 
stocks and bonds are falling. But, like Greenspan's reference to the price of 
gold, it may only be a false alarm.

US-JAPAN TRADE TENSIONS; HIGH-STAKES GAME FOR STATE'S WORKERS; ECONOMY: A TRADE 
WAR COULD PROVE DEVASTATING TO CALIFORNIA'S RECOVERY. BUT SOME COULD BENEFIT. 
</P>

<P>
 Auto designer Gerald P. Hirshberg has been on both sides of the U.S.-Japan 
trade dispute. And, as a former designer for General Motors Corp. and now the 
San Diego-based chief designer for Japanese auto maker Nissan, he still is. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who's being honest who's working for a foreign company . . . (admits) 
you're torn between your allegiances to your country . . . and . . . putting 
food on the table," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So how is he viewing the rising trade tensions between the two economic 
superpowers? "With a wrenched stomach," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hirshberg and tens of thousands of other Californians whose jobs depend on 
ties with Japan are like the proverbial blades of grass that stand to get 
trampled if the elephants fight. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, the elephants are the governments of Japan and the United 
States, and Hirshberg and others are watching warily to see if a full-fledged 
trade war breaks out between them. 
</P>
<P>
 A trade war would be particularly disastrous for California, which has 
stronger trade ties to Japan than other states and whose fragile economy is 
only now starting to rebound after several years of recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade with Japan supports about 340,400 state jobs, including those of 146,400 
people employed by Japanese-owned companies. Japan accounts for $27.3 billion 
in direct investments in California property, plants and equipment, a full 
third of the total foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Though many analysts doubt that a full-fledged commercial war will break out, 
the tensions have been ratcheting up since trade talks between President 
Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa broke down last month. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton is now paving the way for a potential hike in tariffs on 
Japanese goods sold in the United States. A senior Japanese trade official 
warned this week that Japan will retaliate if the United States invokes trade 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Retaliatory sanctions from Japan could affect California exports, which 
amounted to $9.7 billion in 1992. At the same time, U.S. sanctions against 
Japan could imperil crucial supply lines or trading relationships for 
California firms, executives said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, California -- which exports more to Japan than any other state -- 
stands to reap disproportionate benefits if the Clinton Administration's 
policies succeed in opening up Japanese markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, state companies feel they are caught in the middle of a dispute not 
of their making. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the U.S. is demanding right now may not be very fair to us," said Sadao 
(Bill) Kita, executive director of the Japan Business Assn. in Los Angeles, 
which represents 640 regional companies that are owned at least in part by 
Japanese firms.  
</P>
<P>
 "We came here to manufacture . . . and we employ a lot of local people," Kita 
said. "We are, in our opinion, contributing to the economic betterment of the 
U.S. Yet we are still considered a foreign element." 
</P>
<P>
 A wide variety of products are now going to Japan, including electronics, 
industrial machinery, medical devices and a host of agricultural products, from 
rice to raisins, said Akira Kitagawa, deputy director of the California trade 
office in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Japan has invested heavily in California industry. A firm 
that exemplifies that is the state's last remaining automobile plant, a 50-50 
joint venture between Toyota and General Motors Corp. in Fremont.  
</P>
<P>
 Trade sanctions on imported auto parts would have a negative effect on costs 
at the plant, which employs 4,300. "Our most immediate concern is the impact on 
the cost of materials brought in from Japan, such as engines or drive trains" 
that could not be sourced elsewhere, said Michael Damer, a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unclear how such sanctions would ripple beyond the plant. One U.S. 
company, Ohio-based Dana Corp., is already set to begin supplying truck frames 
to the plant from a factory still under construction in nearby Stockton, 
replacing frames now being brought in from Japan. Sanctions only make that 
change more desirable. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Dana owns two plants in Japan that supply auto parts to 
Japanese auto makers. While sanctions would not directly affect those 
operations, the trade tensions do not help.  
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Apple Computer Inc. in Cupertino, which claims the No. 2 market 
position for personal computers in Japan, doubts that any sanctions would 
affect its business there. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Apple does a lot of business both ways: It sells products to Japan and 
imports key components, including parts such as flat-panel displays that cannot 
be sourced here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a big stake in making sure that relations between Japan and the U.S. 
are smooth and professional and continue uninterrupted," an Apple spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Nissan Design International, the 15-year-old San Diego design shop for the 
Japanese auto maker, Hirshberg doubts that a trade war would jeopardize 
operations directly. But there could be fallout.  
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, a strong yen would affect Nissan's product marketing decisions 
in the United States. "Then there's the daily awkwardness of dealing with 
another culture intimately when you're standing on the soil of the 'enemy,' " 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there could also be benefits: Trade sanctions could force Japanese 
companies to move even more manufacturing, engineering or design work to the 
United States. The risk, however, is that a trade war could delay the recovery 
of Japan's recession-battered economy.  
</P>
<P>
 "There would be a danger of winning the battle and losing the war," Hirshberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For some firms -- such as California Steel Industries -- the Japanese ties are 
not obvious. Owned in part by Kawasaki Steel Corp. and by a Brazilian mining 
company, California Steel does little trade with Japan and rarely imports 
components. 
</P>
<P>
 Employing 920 people in part of the old Kaiser plant in Fontana, the maker of 
steel sheets and pipe deals mainly with California firms. But trade tensions 
still concern company President Takehiko Haga.  
</P>
<P>
 "Because I'm Japanese," he said, "I hope Japan and the United States keep a 
good relationship."  
</P>
<P>
 In the short term, the heightened trade tensions might already be generating 
some regional economic benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as Japan does not impose retaliatory sanctions, the tensions may be 
helping California exports, because they have helped boost the value of the yen 
in relation to the dollar, said Kitagawa in the state's Tokyo trade office.  
</P>
<P>
 "The price of (California) products will be extremely cheap," he said.

US-JAPAN TRADE TENSIONS; U.S. READIES SANCTIONS ON JAPAN; TRADE: PRESIDENT 
CLINTON IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE THAT HE IS REVIVING A TARIFF-HIKE PROVISION 
KNOWN AS SUPER 301. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, following through on his threat to retaliate against 
Japan's trade policies, has decided to redeploy an old weapon that would allow 
the Administration to raise tariffs on Japanese goods sold in the United 
States, Administration and congressional sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Renewal of an empowering trade provision known as Super 301 has been 
considered one of the most likely first steps that the Administration would 
take, and White House officials began focusing on it as soon as the talks with 
Japan fell apart during a meeting between Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, in a step supported by the White House, key House and Senate 
members introduced legislation to renew Super 301. And this week, officials 
said, the Administration is aiming to issue an executive order carrying out 
such a step even before the legislation is given formal consideration by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's decision, which follows the failure of U.S. trade negotiators 
to secure agreement by the Japanese to open their markets to American products, 
could be announced as early as Thursday, a congressional source said. But a 
senior Administration official said the action could be delayed until next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the 
"next logical" measure would be the publication of a list of Japanese exports 
on which tariffs could be raised or other sanctions could be applied. The taxes 
on imports would raise prices paid by U.S. consumers to discourage them from 
buying particular Japanese goods. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's approach in the weeks following the failure of the talks 
on Feb. 11 has been built around a plan to increase pressure on Japan week by 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 During the week after the Hosokawa visit, the White House announced that it 
was prepared to impose several hundred million dollars worth of sanctions on 
Japanese products in retaliation for the obstacles encountered by Motorola in 
trying to sell its cellular telephone service in the Tokyo area. The deadline 
for disclosing specific plans in that case is the end of next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Super 301 provision, reviled by Japan and opposed by the Reagan and Bush 
administrations, was part of U.S. trade law in 1989 and 1990. It was intended 
to identify nations that raised the greatest barriers to open trade.  
</P>
<P>
 Only Japan, Brazil and India were cited under the provision. In the case of 
Japan, the threat of sanctions produced agreements -- not entirely successful 
-- to open markets for certain forest products, supercomputers and satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Clinton Administration has not cut off all contact with the 
Japanese, the frenetic talks that were intended to produce import breakthroughs 
in four areas of the Japanese economy -- automobiles and auto parts, medical 
equipment, telecommunications and insurance -- have come to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd M. Bentsen met Saturday in Germany with Japanese 
Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii. But, a Treasury official said, the Japanese 
official "had nothing to offer." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials have said other steps under consideration include: 
slowing Japanese auto exports to the United States with extensive dockside 
safety inspections here, a harassment tool devised by Japan for use against 
U.S. automobiles arriving there; scaling back tax benefits given to Japanese 
auto manufacturers in the United States, and stepping up the use of U.S. laws 
prohibiting the "dumping" on U.S. markets of goods sold at less than the price 
paid in the home market.

ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS: NEWPORT CORP. LOSES $3.7 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Newport Corp., an Irvine manufacturer of precision equipment for the 
development of laser and optics technology, posted a net loss of $3.7 million, 
or 53 cents a share, for 1993, which included restructuring and other special 
charges totaling $5.1 million.Sales were $84.1 million. Because the company 
changed its fiscal year end from July 31 to Dec. 31 as of Jan. 1, comparable 
results are not available for prior-year periods. The fourth-quarter net loss 
was $4.7 million, or 67 cents a share, on sales of $19.9 million.

 Viacom Cable TV Unit Eliminates 43 Jobs: Viacom Inc.'s cable TV systems 
division said it has eliminated 43 positions, most of them at its Pleasanton, 
Calif., headquarters. A company official said the cuts represent about 2% of 
the work force and were made necessary by recent federal regulations rolling 
back cable rates. He said about 15 of the displaced employees will be offered

 Video Game Makers Will Use Movie-Type Ratings: The U.S. video game industry 
has tentatively decided that an anonymous panel of parents, psychologists and 
educators will rate computer games according to the violence and sex they 
contain, industry executives said.The panel would be appointed by a trade 
association that the $6-billion-a-year industry plans to set up. During the 
pre-Christmas rush of game releases, it would have perhaps 25 members. The 
ratings system resembles very closely one that the Motion Picture Assn. of 
America has used to categorize films for 25 years.

 Steelmaker Hit by Strike: About 4,000 members of the United Steelworkers of 
America walked off their jobs at Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. plants in 
three states.It was the company's second labor dispute in nine years. Union 
negotiators said pensions, medical benefits, salaries and retiree insurance 
were some of the sticking points. Wheeling-Pittsburgh, based in Wheeling, W. 
Va., is the nation's eighth-largest company producing steel from scratch. Last 
year, the company performed strongly but still posted a loss of $6.2 million as 
it paid off debt earlier than anticipated. The current, three-year labor 
contract was part of the company's re-emergence from bankruptcy in 1991.

BOND YIELDS SOAR AGAIN, STOCKS FALL

<P>
 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * Fresh worries about higher inflation Tuesday sent Treasury bond yields 
soaring to levels last seen in June. Short-term yields also surged, on the 
assumption that the Federal Reserve Board will tighten credit again soon. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stocks were hit by rising interest rates, but prices regained some ground 
late in the day. Credit 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's 30-year bond yield rocketed to an eight-month high of 6.78% 
from 6.65% on Monday, after two economic reports proved too much for jittery 
investors to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 First was a report by the nation's purchasing executives that showed an 
unexpected surge in materials prices last month to the highest level since 
October, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the government said it revised its estimate of the economy's 
fourth-quarter growth rate to 7.5% -- well above expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields have been rising sharply since the Fed boosted short-term rates by 
a quarter point on Feb. 4, causing a chain reaction of bond selling by 
high-powered speculators and other players. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, traditional investors have been unwilling to bid for bonds despite 
higher yields, because of fears that inflation will accelerate with the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But many economists point out that although prices of some commodities are 
rising, those costs are relatively minor in the scheme of things. Labor 
accounts for two-thirds of manufacturers' production costs, and there appears 
to be no real wage pressure in the economy, with unemployment high. 
</P>
<P>
 "The underlying rate of inflation is determined in the labor markets," said 
economist Edward Yardeni at C.J. Lawrence Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, bond traders remain suspicious about inflation's trend, allowing 
bond prices to free-fall and yields to surge. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, there is widespread belief that the Fed will boost short-term rates 
again soon in at attempt to show that it is serious about keeping the economy's 
growth rate, and inflation, moderate. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the yield on six-month T-bills soared to 3.85% from 3.70% on 
Monday, reflecting expectations of a Fed tightening. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 Stocks spent the day solidly lower but recovered from their worst levels 
toward day's end. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrials, off more than 40 points at midday, closed down 
22.79 points at 3,809.23. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 2 to 1 
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other major market indicators, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index 
fell 2.70 points to 464.44, while the Nasdaq composite of mostly smaller stocks 
lost 3.86 points to 788.64. 
</P>
<P>
 As stocks followed bonds, they ignored one bright piece of news: S&P reported 
that 226 companies raised cash dividends to shareholders in February, up from 
185 in January and the best monthly total since February, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies' willingness to boost dividends is usually a sign of their 
confidence in rising profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday'st highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Interest-sensitive stocks tumbled. Citicorp fell 1 1/8 to 40 3/8, Travelers 
dropped 1 1/2 to 35 5/8 and home builder Centex slumped 1 3/4 to 35 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among blue chips, Alcoa shrank 3/4 to 74 1/2, Goodyear dropped 1 1/4 to 44 
and International Paper slid 1 to 71 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bucking the trend was Digital Equipment, which was upgraded to "buy" from 
"hold" by Salomon Bros. and rose 2 1/8 to 31 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Frankfurt's DAX index dropped 24.52 points to 2,067.05, while 
London's FTSE-100 sank 57.5 points to 3,270.6. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index tumbled with Wall Street, losing 71.29 points 
to 2,514.15. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo shares gained. The Nikkei added 219.42 points to 20,216.62. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold lost ground on the New York Comex, falling $3.10 to $378.30 an ounce. 
Silver fell 8.3 cents to $5.27. 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar rose slightly on news of stronger-than-expected economic growth.

COKE ABOUT TO DIVE INTO A JUICY MARKET; BEVERAGES: FRUITOPIA FRUIT DRINKS ARE 
ENTERING A $6-BILLION INDUSTRY THAT IS CURRENTLY DOMINATED BY SNAPPLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coca-Cola shook up the growing alternative-beverage industry Tuesday, 
introducing a new line of fruit drinks that is expected to accelerate the 
evolution of the soft drink giants into broader-based beverage companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The move also signals that the great minds and financial powers of the soft 
drink industry have finally begun to see the future as many consumers envision 
it -- and it is not carbonated. 
</P>
<P>
 By April 1, Fruitopia -- a non-carbonated fruit drink clearly designed to 
appeal to youth -- will begin to appear on store shelves nationwide under the 
familiar banner of Minute Maid, a division of Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The action is a tardy but still intricately planned move by Coke to grab a 
stake in the estimated $6-billion alternative beverage industry dominated by 
Snapple. The category includes fruit drinks, teas, waters and sports drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 The beverages are typically lower in sugar and calories than conventional soft 
drinks, but often are not as "healthy" as many consumers perceive them to be, 
analysts say. The hip names given the drinks point to the youthful customers 
being pursued. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's cosmic marketing," said Larry Jabbonsky, editor of Beverage World, a 
Great Neck, N.Y.-based trade publication. Among the youth-oriented names that 
Coke has devised for its eight fruit-flavored drinks: Lemonade Love & Hope, 
Citrus Consciousness and The Grape Beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers have been turning away from carbonated soft drinks for several 
years, particularly in the diet cola segment. Last year, for the first time, 
cola sales accounted for less than half the $50-billion soft drink market. 
</P>
<P>
 With Tuesday's announcement of the introduction of Fruitopia, Coke expects to 
quickly grab a huge chunk of the market. With the aid of a $30-million ad 
campaign created by leading-edge Venice agency Chiat/Day, industry analysts say 
Coke seems to be on the right track. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coke is molting from a soft drink maker into a multifaceted beverage 
company," said Jesse Myers, editor of Beverage Digest, a Stamford, Conn.-based 
trade publication. "While Coke is late in coming to the market, it probably 
won't be long until they dominate." 
</P>
<P>
 Coke executives say they expect to grab a 15% share of the alternative 
beverage market within the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are changing the definition of soft drinks to include beverages," Sergio 
Zyman, Coke's global marketing chief, said at a news conference Tuesday in New 
York.  
</P>
<P>
 Coke and Pepsi both entered the iced tea market in 1992, linking up with 
Nestea and Lipton, respectively. Pepsi went a step further that year and 
entered a joint venture with Ocean Spray. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest move by Coke "only affirms the direction we took when we saw the 
light a couple years ago," said Brian Swette, senior vice president at Pepsico. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the undisputed leader in the alternative beverage field has been 
Snapple Beverage Co. In 1993, Snapple had a 22.9% market share in the category, 
compared to 12.9% for Coca-Cola and 11.7% for Pepsico, according to the Maxwell 
Consumer Report. 
</P>
<P>
 While Coke's announcement sent Snapple stock spinning down $1.75 per share to 
close Tuesday at $27.125 on Nasdaq, executives at the Valley Stream, N.Y-based 
firm expressed little concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coke and Pepsi made me a rich man two years ago when they went into the tea 
business," said Leonard Marsh, president and chief executive of Snapple. 
</P>
<P>
 "They helped expand the entire category, and my business has flourished ever 
since. Now they're going to do the same thing with fruit juice." 
</P>
<P>
 But Marsh concedes that Snapple might have a particularly tough time competing 
with Coke and Pepsi in the global market. Coke and Pepsi have far superior 
international distribution systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the difference between them and us is, I don't have to be No. 1 in the 
world," Marsh said. "I'm just looking to build and grow my business, and they 
will help me by expanding the category." 
</P>
<P>
 Coca-Cola slipped 25 cents Tuesday to $42.375, while Pepsico closed unchanged 
at $39.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.

OFFICIAL SAYS EUROPE WILLING TO DO LUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An influential European official involved in film and television policy-making 
assured Hollywood on Tuesday that Europe will be open to discussions about 
loosening its restrictive film and television policies. 
</P>
<P>
 But Joao de Deus Pinheiro also warned that European countries may impose 
further "shrewd protectionist measures" unless their moribund entertainment 
industry recovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinheiro, European commissioner for culture and audiovisual policy, traced 
protectionist sentiment that came to a head in December's Geneva trade talks to 
the poor shape of Europe's film and television production. In the eventual 
trade agreement reached under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 
Hollywood was unable to get audiovisual issues included -- thus missing an 
opportunity to have European protectionist measures eased. Some countries, for 
example, impose quotas on U.S. films broadcast on television. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the industry picks up and it is seen as picking up, then all these 
measures will fade away," Pinheiro predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks came during a luncheon speech and news conference at the American 
Film Market in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood gets about 50% of its box office revenue from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting the seriousness of the issue, many of Hollywood's top leaders have 
been meeting with Pinheiro this week while he is in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinheiro said European Union officials plan to draft a "green paper" on 
audiovisual issues, although the paper's eventual purpose remains vague. "What 
it means is not to identify remedies, but rather to stir the discussions," 
Pinheiro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, said the trade 
group has offered its input but hasn't been invited to give it yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I hope is that they don't make things sterner, tougher and 
increase the governmental regulatory thicket through which one must pass," 
Valenti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Pinheiro denied reports that he is out to lower the boom on United 
International Pictures, which distributes movies in foreign markets for 
Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures and MGM/UA. Reports have quoted Pinheiro 
as opposing an extension of an antitrust waiver to UIP. He said he was only 
expressing the widely held view of European business, not his personal opinion.

JUSTICES RULE COPYRIGHT SUIT LOSERS CAN BE LIABLE FOR FEES; LAW: THE DECISION 
INVOLVING ROCK MUSICIAN JOHN FOGERTY COULD HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT IN THE 
COMPUTER INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court on Tuesday made it potentially more costly to file a 
copyright infringement suit, ruling that losers can be forced to pay the legal 
fees of the winning side. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9-0 decision came in an unusual case in which rock music legend John 
Fogerty was sued for allegedly copying his own earlier work after selling the 
rights to a record company. A jury in San Francisco ultimately rejected that 
claim, and now the high court has said the losing party can be forced to pay 
Fogerty more than $1 million in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the case arose in the entertainment field, its impact may be greatest 
in the computer industry, where companies such as Apple Computer, 
Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft have been engaged in high-stakes disputes over 
copyrights for software products.  
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said Tuesday's decision will prompt plaintiffs to think more 
carefully before filing copyright infringement suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically in U.S. courts, each side is responsible for its own legal costs, 
although Congress can impose different arrangements.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Copyright Act of 1976 is one of the exceptions. It says that a judge "may 
award reasonable fees to the prevailing party." 
</P>
<P>
 In practice, however, the federal courts in California and New York generally 
exempt losing plaintiffs from paying the costs of the other side. That approach 
was justified as a way to ensure broad protection for copyright holders, such 
as composers and writers. 
</P>
<P>
 Shielded from the possibility of paying double fees, they would be freer to 
file suits to protect their copyrights. But the high court threw out that "dual 
standard" Tuesday and ruled that both sides are to be treated equally in 
copyright disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 The case before the court was unusual because a composer was accused of 
essentially copying his own work. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, Fogerty was the lead singer of Creedence Clearwater Revival when he 
wrote "Run Through the Jungle." He later sold the rights to the song to Fantasy 
Inc., a record company. In 1985, Fogerty recorded a comeback album for Warner 
Bros. that included the song "The Old Man Down the Road." 
</P>
<P>
 Fantasy filed a lawsuit in San Francisco, alleging that the new song was 
essentially the old music with new words. After a two-week trial, a jury ruled 
for Fogerty, but the judge refused to force Fantasy to pay Fogerty's $1-million 
legal bill.  
</P>
<P>
 Those decisions are in error, the Supreme Court said, and it sent the case 
back to a judge to consider awarding the singer the "reasonable attorney's fee" 
set forth in the law.

 Time Warner Delays Information Superhighway Test: The publishing and media 
conglomerate said it will delay until the fourth quarter a test of its Full 
Service Network in Orlando, Fla.-- a sign that the information superhighway may 
take much longer to build than predicted. The FSN, which will offer subscribers 
everything from movies on demand to home shopping and banking, originally was 
to be made available to 4,000 households starting next month. The network, 
billed as the most advanced U.S. cable system, combines the functions of 
conventional cable TV with telephone service. Time Warner officials said 
writing the software for it and building the set-top terminals is taking longer 
and proving more difficult than expected.

 Ford Strike in Mexico Ends: The auto maker's Mexico unit signed a new contract 
with workers, ending a two-week strike at Ford's Chihuahua plant.Ford Motor Co. 
workers walked off their jobs at the plant in northern Mexico on Feb. 9 after 
union leaders and company representatives failed to reach agreement. They 
returned to work after accepting the company's latest wage increase proposal. 
Under the new contract, the workers will receive a 5% wage increase and a 3% 
increase in productivity bonuses. Ford also agreed to raise their compensation 
2% through indirect benefits, such as food coupons and bonuses. The Chihuahua 
plant, which employs 618 people, is designed to produce Ford's new, 
four-cylinder "Z" engine.

GAS CO. EMPLOYEES APPROVE CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a highly visible campaign, the unions representing most Southern 
California Gas Co. employees have voted to accept a new contract that includes 
the provision union leaders had most hotly contested: a company proposal that 
could lead to the use of outside contractors to replace some full-time 
employees, including meter readers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty percent of participating union members voted to accept the two-year 
contract.It includes an immediate 0.25% raise, a 2.5% raise effective April 1 
and a 3% raise a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 Contract negotiations broke down in August, primarily over plans by the 
utility to increase efficiency in various departments. Union leaders said that 
could include replacing up to 1,100 current employees with contract personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Union employees staged a one-day strike Oct. 1, but members voted in December 
and January against longer strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone is happy to get this behind us," said Joyce Rowland, Gas Co. 
manager of labor relations. 
</P>

 Rowland said workers and union and company representatives have been meeting

She estimated that the company wants to save 45% of the costs attributed to 
meter reading, a task that employs 450 people.

 Union leaders say their members were afraid to vote against the contract.

 "The company just killed us to death with threats to replace the workers,"

the company's 9,200 employees.

TURNER PICTURES SIGNS DAWN STEEL AS A PRODUCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood executive Dawn Steel, who turned down the chance to run Turner 
Pictures last year, has instead signed a contract to make movies for the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner will have first rights to all projects generated by Atlas 
Entertainment, a new company headed by Steel, her husband, producer Charles 
Roven, and his partner, Bob Cavallo. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlas is expected to produce two or three movies a year, including some 
animated features to be made in partnership with Turner's Hanna-Barbera unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel said she opted for the production deal instead of the job running Turner 
Pictures because she wanted to stay on the creative side of the business. 
"Being an executive was not something I wanted to do again," she said. "This 
gives me an opportunity to make movies, and to make them with people I 
respect." 
</P>
<P>
 She recently produced "Cool Runnings" and "Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit" 
for Walt Disney Co. Before that, she ran Columbia Pictures and was president of 
production at Paramount Pictures. She also wrote the recently published book 
"They Can Kill You, but They Can't Eat You." 
</P>
<P>
 Signing Steel is Atlanta-based cable titan Ted Turner's latest move to expand 
his Hollywood operations. His Turner Entertainment Group recently acquired two 
independent production companies, New Line Cinema and Castle Rock 
Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Sassa, president of Turner Entertainment Group, said the company is 
still looking for an executive to run Turner Pictures.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: B&BS BECOMING A BUSINESS TRAVEL OPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL SMITH, CAROL SMITH is a free-lance writer based in Pasadena.

<P>
 The boom in bed and breakfast innkeeping has had a spinoff effect for business 
travelers. As the number of inns has mushroomed to between 15,000 and 20,000, 
from fewer than 1,000 a decade ago, competition has increased, and a growing 
number of inns are looking for ways to attract midweek business travelers to 
help boost their occupancy rates. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, small bed and breakfasts, once known for their parlor ambience or 
their gourmet breakfasts, are now advertising fax machines, computer hookups, 
the latest in audiovisual equipment and ergonomic chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 This shift comes at a time when a segment of the business travel market is 
already looking for alternatives to large corporate hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 "In late 1987, we saw a shift (in corporate travel) beginning to happen," said 
Ron Callari, a former executive with Marriott Hotels. "We were beginning to see 
professionals looking for more intimate, smaller facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, companies were trying to find places for retreats or workshops 
to focus on strategic planning or team building in a private atmosphere. Other 
travelers, especially women on business, wanted a place that offered a greater 
sense of security. And some companies wanted the exclusivity and service that 
comes with being able to book every room in the place. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensing a market opportunity, Callari struck out on his own to form 
INNovations Inc. in Cranford, N.J., one of the first sales and marketing 
agencies for inns wanting to capitalize on the business travel and meeting 
marketplace. By 1992, he was booking more than 600 meetings a year into inns or 
bed and breakfasts. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent survey Callari conducted showed that between 25% and 35% of Fortune 
500 companies have used a bed and breakfast or inn for business travel at least 
once. 
</P>
<P>
 And the number appears to be growing. Urban area inns report about 23% of 
their guests are now business travelers, said Pat Hardy, co-executive director 
of the Professional Assn. of Innkeepers International in Santa Barbara. 
Although this is the first year the association has surveyed its members 
regarding business travelers, Hardy said her conversations with innkeepers 
indicate business travel is up. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason many more inns are going after the business travel market is the 
demographics of people running inns. Until a few years ago, innkeeping was a 
cottage industry, run largely by retired people. But with the wave of corporate 
downsizings and restructurings that started in the 1980s, many mid-career 
professionals looking for a lifestyle change began running bed and breakfasts. 
They brought with them not just professional skills, but the desire to make the 
inns profitable businesses, Callari said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, according to statistics kept by the Professional Assn. of Innkeepers 
International, the majority of innkeepers today are between 40 and 55 years 
old. More than 75% are college graduates who came out of executive, 
administrative, computer, professional, sales education or human services jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Innkeepers have become more sophisticated in their handling of guests," Hardy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most difficult aspect of building the business marketplace has been 
dispelling the image that all inns and bed and breakfasts still have shared 
baths and no phones or other technological amenities. 
</P>
<P>
 That may have been true a few years ago, when only about 26% of inns even had 
phones in the rooms. By 1992, however, more than 65% of inns in urban areas had 
telephones, and 42% had fax machines on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, about 40% of inns and bed and breakfasts have done the kind of 
upgrading necessary to attract business clients, Callari said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Linda Davies, who runs the Simpson House Inn in Santa Barbara, 
said all her rooms have telephones with extra jacks for fax machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Rooms also have tables or desks, coffee machines, refrigerators and whirlpool 
baths. 
</P>
<P>
 Midweek, about half the guests are there on business, she said. "And I do feel 
like it's growing." 
</P>
<P>
 But inns are having to fight for the business. "In general, people would like 
to have more corporate travel midweek," she said. "But it's a difficult market 
to break into." 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Martin Winn, who runs the Upham Hotel & Cottages in Santa Barbara, went 
after corporate business several years ago when several new, large stores were 
going into Santa Barbara's downtown mall. Executives from Nordstrom and Sharper 
Image began staying there and have continued whenever they are in town, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see it growing right now," she said. "But it's taken a lot of hard work 
focusing on the corporate traveler." 
</P>
<P>
 Bed and breakfast guides are also making it easier to locate business rooms in 
smaller inns. The "Professional Inn Guide" from Colburn Press in New Jersey 
will be available in bookstores soon. (It is available now by writing P.O. Box 
356, Montvale, NJ 97645.) 
</P>
<P>
 And Pamela Lanier's "Complete Guide to Bed & Breakfasts, Inns & Guesthouses in 
the United States and Canada" (Lanier Publishing) now has a section on inns 
with conference facilities. The next edition will have a section on inns and 
bed and breakfasts with business amenities, Lanier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanier Publishing also has its bed and breakfast guide available on-line 
through CompuServe. In addition to providing listings of inns that offer 
business services, the new service has an Inn Forum, through which users can 
communicate about their inn experiences. (For more information, contact Lanier

PERSONAL VIEW: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Name: Sikoki Layton 
</P>
<P>
 * Position: Flight attendant 
</P>
<P>
 * Company: United Airlines 
</P>
<P>
 As an international flight attendant for almost 17 years, I have had the good 
fortune to see much of this fascinating and diverse planet. However, making 
several trips each month to some distant corner of the world can also take its 
toll on the body and mind. Crossing countless time zones, going from one season 
to the opposite and being cooped up with hundreds of strangers with all their 
idiosyncrasies and germs -- all as you hurl through space in a steel tube -- 
can definitely have an adverse effect on an otherwise normal and healthy 
individual. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, I have discovered my own arsenal of weapons against jet lag. 
</P>
<P>
 The first secret weapon is exercise. My advice is to have a regular exercise 
program that you do at home that can be modified to go with you when you 
travel. Even just simple stretches, yoga or running in place can help ward off 
the effects of jet lag if they're part of your daily routine at home. 
</P>
<P>
 I carry a small cassette player in my tote bag with Jane Fonda's advanced 
workout on tape, and I have sweated and groaned with Jane all over the world! 
In her Feb. 16 article, Carol Smith described some excellent in-flight 
exercises to keep you from getting "saddle sores" and to help your circulation 
while on the airplane. One reason the flight attendants sometimes arrive 
feeling better than the passengers after a long trip is that we've been up and 
moving about during the flight. 
</P>
<P>
 My second suggestion is to take vitamins. Eating can be irregular during 
travel, and in some destinations it's sometimes risky to eat fresh fruits and 
vegetables, so a supplement couldn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the contributing factors to jet lag is dehydration. The aircraft 
environment is much drier than any place you might call home -- even the 
desert. For this reason, I recommend drinking a glass of water every hour 
you're in flight. The dry air also wreaks havoc on your skin, so a good 
moisturizer is a necessity. Sometimes a little Vasoline or Mentholatum inside 
the nose keeps your sinuses from getting dried out as well. Chapstick or lip 
balm is helpful, and sucking on a cough drop during those long night flights 
will often keep your mouth and throat from getting so parched. (My favorites 
are the sugarless N'ICE lozenges.) 
</P>
<P>
 As part of my regular fitness program, I avoid alcohol, tobacco and caffeine 
and highly encourage any traveler to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My fifth secret is to think in terms of the time zone where you're headed, not 
the one you're coming from. I always tell the passengers, "It's only what time 
it is where you are -- not where you were!" The sooner your mind can convince 
your body it's in a new time zone, the sooner you'll adjust.  
</P>
<P>
 And lastly, be willing to take naps. When you arrive in Hong Kong or 
Frankfurt, ask yourself, "How do I feel?" If the answer is "Exhausted," first 
look at the local time (your watch should already be set to it), count how many 
hours before your normal bedtime and take a nap for half of it. That way you'll 
get up in the afternoon with time to get acquainted with your new surroundings, 
have dinner and go to bed at your normal bedtime there, regardless of what time 
it might be at home. Chances are you'll wake up the next morning right on 
schedule with the locals. Never hesitate to take a short siesta. On your return 
flight, use the same technique.

HOARDING RESULTS IN JAPAN RICE SHORTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Japan opened its long-protected rice market Tuesday to full-scale sales of 
foreign-domestic blends, consumers responded by sweeping shelves bare of 
domestic varieties. 
</P>
<P>
 When trial sales of imported rice began last month, curious consumers and 
bargain hunters bought out supplies at some stores within hours, raising the 
hopes of those who want to see a smooth penetration of Japan's market by 
foreign varieties. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, however, the discovery of mold or discoloration in some 
import shipments and concerns about taste has led to panic buying of domestic 
varieties. And some rice merchants are hoarding scarce domestic supplies for 
favored customers who don't want to have to buy the mixed blends. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, even as imports are introduced to make up for a poor domestic harvest, 
Japan faces an artificially created rice shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday, matters had become so severe that at some stores, not only did 
domestically grown varieties disappear, but the new blends of 30% domestic and 
70% foreign rice sold out as well. 
</P>
<P>
 A newscaster on Fuji Television compared the buying frenzy to an irrational 
run on toilet paper in the fall of 1973, when consumers became frightened that 
the shock of rapidly rising oil prices would somehow lead to a shortage of that 
commodity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time since right after World War II that we've experienced 
a rice shortage," said an elderly man at a supermarket that had run out of all 
varieties of rice. 
</P>
<P>
 However, officials stressed that with the availability of imports, there is no 
actual shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was anticipating this sort of phenomenon," Agriculture Minister Eijiro Hata 
told reporters at a news conference in which he urged the media not to worsen 
the panic buying. "Please cooperate, and understand that the absolute quantity 
of rice is sufficient." 
</P>
<P>
 Current sales are of "emergency" imports to make up for last year's crop 
losses due to bad weather in Japan. But because Japan agreed during 
multilateral trade talks in December to a permanent, partial opening of its 
rice market, starting in 1995, these imports are seen here and abroad as the 
opening shot in a foreign assault on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The government, which controls most rice distribution, had earlier announced 
that it planned to mix domestic and foreign varieties. But many consumers had 
not realized until very recently that standard government rice -- the kind most 
widely available -- would contain 70% imported varieties for the next eight 
months. Imports are from California, China and Thailand. Tuesday was the first 
day for the rice to be widely offered in stores across Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer concerns over the quality of imports were heightened Monday evening 
when Yuko Takasaki, a member of Parliament's upper house, received nationwide 
television news coverage for a dramatic attack on the quality of imported Thai 
rice. Speaking before a budgetary committee, she charged that dead mice, dead 
cockroaches, cigarette butts, metal bars, pebbles and rubber bands had been 
found in the rice. A photograph of a dead mouse that she used to illustrate her 
charges was also broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's Food Agency, responsible for rice supplies, has announced 
that out of 50,000 tons of imported rice it handled during February, mold or 
discoloration was found in 141 tons. The discovery of such problems has 
received considerable media coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly as a result, the price of popular domestic brands has soared. One 
supermarket that opened Tuesday morning with high-quality koshihikari rice 
offered at $62 for a 22-pound bag -- well above its usual price -- had sold out 
a 100-bag supply within 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 A rice shop owner interviewed by Fuji Television admitted that he was offering 
Japanese rice only to steady customers.

 Germany Lets Key Lending Rate Decline: Germany's Bundesbank let fall a key 
money market interest rate it had held steady since December. Europe's most 
influential central bank said its securities-repurchase interest rate, which 
sets the tone for other short-term money market rates, fell to a minimum of 
5.97% -- below 6% for the first time in five years. Analysts said that more 
cuts in the rate are likely to follow in coming weeks to pave the way to a 
further reduction of the discount rate -- now 5.25% -- sometime in the second 
quarter.

THEATER REVIEW; PASSIONATE PORTRAYAL OF JUDEO-CHRISTIAN CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lamb's Players Theatre has struck a blow for the theater of the mind with its 
riveting San Diego County premiere of "Edith Stein," Arthur Giron's provoking 
and disturbing look at the life of an enigmatic and controversial woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Giron's tale was inspired by Edith Stein, a brilliant Jewish doctor of 
philosophy who converted to Roman Catholicism at 30, became a Carmelite nun 
(with the name Sister Teresa Benedicta of the Cross) at 41 and was killed at 
Auschwitz when she was 50 for having been born a Jew. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope beatified her in 1987 and, as recently as 1991, her memory was at the 
center of an angry controversy. That erupted when a Carmelite convent erected 
in her honor at the Auschwitz death camp in Poland was closed under pressure 
from Jewish groups that were deeply offended that a convent should preside over 
the site where millions of Jews died agonizing deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, the play itself will undoubtedly polarize people on the question of 
religion, as did Stein herself. The sad part of that is Stein always saw 
herself as Jewish and Christian. All she ever really seemed to want was for 
everyone to get along. 
</P>
<P>
 What has troubled most critics -- particularly the New York critics in 
response to a production in January at the Jewish Repertory Theater -- is that 
Giron never explains why Stein converted. What is even more disturbing to this 
critic is why that should matter: Shouldn't everyone's religious choice -- as 
Stein herself suggested -- be an issue between the individual and God? 
</P>
<P>
 Still, although Giron does not favor us with answers, he does throw out 
several tantalizing possibilities. In the Jewish holiday of Purim, which Stein 
celebrates early in the play, the tale is told of a Jewish woman named Esther 
who marries a king. The king, unaware that his beloved wife is Jewish, is 
persuaded by an evil man, Haman, to kill all the Jews in his kingdom. Esther 
reveals herself, and the king saves the Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Could Stein have seen herself as an Esther married to Christ (as nuns are), 
trying to win the favor of God, or at least that of the Pope, in sparing her 
people from the Holocaust? She entreated Pope Pius XI in writing to issue an 
encyclical condemning Nazism. But he never did. 
</P>
<P>
 Or was the church the avenue for continuing her work -- as she was banned from 
all professorial posts in Germany because she was Jewish (she did much of her 
important work after her conversion). Or, given the restrictions of her 
Orthodox heritage -- a tradition in which women are gated away from the altar 
where the Torah is read -- was the church the only place she felt she could get 
close to God? 
</P>
<P>
 Or should one simply take her at her word: That she was inspired by reading 
the story of Saint Teresa of Avila, whose name she took? 
</P>
<P>
 Giron begins his story at the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz in 1987, where 
the prioress (Sandra Ellis-Troy) meets with a Jewish Holocaust survivor (Daniel 
Mann) who is angry about the presence of the convent. 
</P>
<P>
 She tells him the story of Stein. We flash back, following Stein, played with 
stunning, luminous passion by Deborah Gilmour Smyth, from her girlhood to her 
relationship with her mother (Ann Richardson, radiating dignity and fierce 
intelligence), from the colleagues and nuns who influenced her to the dialogue 
with a Nazi, Karl-Heinz, that leads to her painful self-discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The real flaw in the story is the dialogue with the Nazi, which is totally 
Giron's creation. It's clever as a dramatic way to drive the second act to its 
deadly conclusion, but it's also a device that wears its gears on its sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl-Heinz, played with chilling suggestiveness by Doug Reger, keeps telling 
us he's obsessed with marrying the purity that is Sister Teresa, but doesn't 
show us why he singles her out over the other nuns. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the sensitive hand of director Robert Smyth, the theater's artistic 
director, all the performances meld seamlessly, from Cynthia Peters' as Edith's 
confused and troubled friend to Donal Pugh's as Franzy, the cool Nazi who 
recruits Karl-Heinz for the party -- fresh out of prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is Deborah Gilmour Smyth's radiant presence that captures the complex, 
difficult nature of Stein. The music Gilmour Smyth composed and performed for 
the piece deepens the show's haunting mood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Buckley's spare lighting and bare, suggestive set -- metal trees, barbed 
wire overhead, a circle surrounded by splashes of red suggesting blood and fire 
-- serve this imaginative production well. Jeanne Reith's costumes move from 
period perfection to the dreamily suggestive as in the coarsely woven 
flesh-colored garments for the death camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Giron, who was raised Catholic but has a Jewish heritage on his mother's side, 
seems to have been intensely involved in this particular story since an early 
version of "Edith Stein" was mounted at the Arena Stage in Washington in 1969, 
15 years before the convent was erected that inspired the current framework of 
the play. 
</P>
<P>
 This work has the passion and heart to go the distance. If the playwright can 
solve his character problems, particularly in the exchange between Stein and 
the Nazi, it might also have legs.

 'Schindler's' Screens: Select Germans and Israelis got their first look at 
Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's List" at special screenings on Tuesday. In 
Frankfurt, many guests emerged from the premiere of the Holocaust film near 
tears but Germany's Jewish leader was skeptical whether the film would help 
combat racism. Ignatz Bubis, himself a concentration camp survivor, said, "It 
will always be the same people who feel affected by such films, and not the 
neo-Nazis." Many Germans were almost too moved to speak as they left the 
charity premiere, also attended by President Richard von Weizsaecker. . . . In 
Tel Aviv, the film about Oskar Schindler, a war profiteer who saved about 1,200 
Jews from the Nazi gas chambers, was seen by two dozen of the survivors, who 
emerged red-eyed from the screening. "The movie is too rosy in comparison to 
what actually happened," one said. "Apparently (Spielberg) didn't want to 
horrify too much." TELEVISION

back onstage for his first official visit to the set where he spent 11 years. 
His return Monday was to NBC's Studio 6-A as a guest on his old show, now known 
as "Late Night With Conan O'Brien." "I love what you've done with the place," a 
relaxed and gracious Letterman told O'Brien, who has met with only moderate 
success as Letterman's replacement. Added Letterman, the reigning ratings king 
of late night with his show at CBS: "You guys do an incredible amount of comedy 
. . . that is very high-level, and the volume and the quality of the stuff just 
knocks me out. There's nothing like this show on television and I really, 
really appreciate that."

 South Orange County may not rival Lillehammer as a hub of cultural diversity, 
but you never would have known it Monday during folk harpist Kim Robertson's 
delightfully cosmopolitan concert at Shade Tree Stringed Instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout a nearly two-hour performance before a full house, her Celtic harp 
held within its strings and wood the diverse musical offerings of the human 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Wisconsin and based in Minnesota, Robertson has engaged in a variety 
of performing, recording and teaching projects during her 12-year career. Her 
work not only spans 18 albums (including collections and collaborations), but 
she has also published seven volumes of harp arrangements, released two 
instructional videos, and routinely presents workshops and retreats emphasizing 
the harp's healing powers. 
</P>
<P>
 Musically, her vast repertoire includes traditional Celtic folk, classical, 
Renaissance and medieval works as well as original compositions, which, since 
her 1991 album "Angels in Disguise," feature her vocals as well as her harp. 
</P>
<P>
 As she walked onto the Shade Tree stage, Robertson looked elegant in a long 
brown dress and gold-and-black vest. Appearing a little stiff, she politely 
greeted the audience and began her presentation with the traditional Irish tune 
"Merilee Kissed the Quaker." She soon warmed to the crowd, chatting and 
welcoming them to "Shade Tree -- the Carnegie Hall of Orange County."  
</P>
<P>
 Robertson's two solo sets took us around the globe, as she presented several 
Irish and Scottish selections, a Latin piece ("Luna de Miere"), an original 
composition in French ("Mon Ami"), a medley of American folk tunes and a 
classic lullaby ("Tender Shepherd"). Her song introductions and quips ("I 
brought two harps so I could have two harps out of tune") became more 
natural-sounding and brought a welcome spontaneity and personality to the show. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the first set, she followed Henry Purcell's "Hornpipe" with her 
strongest, most emotional song of the evening. Inspired by an article she read 
in National Geographic, her African-based "Dance of Wadabe" is a sensual, 
passionate composition filled with complex, shifting rhythms. This solo 
instrumental needed no words to convey the mystery and excitement of romantic 
pursuit in a faraway land. 
</P>
<P>
 Other highlights included an energetic, spunky rendering of "Butterfly Jig," a 
sing-along to the Scottish ballad "Wild Mountain Thyme" and another Robertson 
original titled "Oopla," which featured some swirling, cascading notes that 
threatened to dance right off of the harp strings. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson's incredible technique was evident early in the Shade Tree program. 
During 17th-Century Irish composer O'Carolan's "Lord Galloway's Lamentation," 
she plucked the strings gently one moment, aggressively the next. Her timely 
chord progressions reflected the nuances of tone and mood, where just one note 
can carry so much narrative or emotional meaning.  
</P>
<P>
 The show's only fault was its uneven pacing. Robertson's presentation lacked 
momentum, never building to a climax. Near the concert's closing, it appeared a 
peak was about to materialize when she followed an upbeat medley with "Maya," 
one of her outstanding originals. But, for some reason, it fell surprisingly 
flat. 
</P>
<P>
 If this rich sampling of Robertson's work didn't have quite all the cultural 
diversity of the Winter Olympics, the concert nevertheless brought some of the 
world's sweetest music to Laguna Niguel.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'BELLE EPOQUE': A BEAUTIFUL INTERLUDE IN TURBULENT TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fernando Trueba's sexy, bittersweet and contemplative comedy, "Belle Epoque" 
(at the Royal and Esquire), takes us back in time and place to an uncertain but 
hopeful moment of calm before the storm. 
</P>
<P>
 It's February, 1931, somewhere in Spain. The previous December, there was an 
uprising in Madrid against King Alfonso XIII, who would soon leave the country, 
paving the way for the Republicans to gain control of the government by the end 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Trueba and his co-writers imagine a magical interlude in a sunny idyllic 
setting, where freedom and passion reign. He views the workings of the human 
comedy with the wisdom and detached compassion of Jean Renoir, to whom the 
Oscar-nominated "Belle Epoque," could stand as a homage. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleeing Madrid for the countryside and dreaming vaguely of emigrating to 
America, Fernando (Jorge Sanz), a handsome young army deserter, lands in a 
charming rural community after a darkly comic -- and ultimately prophetic -- 
encounter with a pair of Civil Guards. In the parlor of the local brothel, 
where the leaders of tiny Arcos, including the priest, regularly play cards, 
Fernando is taken under the wing of the leading member of the landed gentry, 
the aging but vital Don Manolo (the great veteran character star Fernando 
Fernan Gomez).  
</P>
<P>
 Don Manolo lives alone in his fine old manor house, and takes a paternal 
interest in Fernando. Several days later, Fernando has said his farewells, when 
suddenly the Don's four attractive daughters descend upon their father. The 
bowled-over Fernando, not surprisingly, manages to miss his train. 
</P>
<P>
 In good time he manages to have his way with them -- and vice versa. There's 
Clara (Miriam Diaz-Aroca), a man-hungry recent widow; the gorgeous Rocio 
(Maribel Verdu), clumsily, presumptuously pursued by a rich nerd (Gabino Diego) 
and his titanically overbearing mother (veteran comedian Chus Lampreave); the 
pig-tailed, virginal Luz (Penelope Cruz) and Violeta (Ariadna Gil), a lesbian 
who finds herself attracted to Fernando once she's got herself in a military 
uniform and him dressed as a maid, costumed for a carnival celebration. Fresh 
from the seminary, Fernando, who is initially naive and even prim, finds 
himself the sole male in a rural "La Ronde." 
</P>
<P>
 Trueba looks beyond these lusty, comic and uninhibited couplings to envision a 
world where reigns a pagan freedom of spirit, epitomized by the open-minded, 
uninhibited Don Manolo, grateful for the hugely theatrical arrival of his 
opera-singer wife (Mary Carmen Ramirez), accompanied by her rich, devoted 
manager/lover (France's peerless comedian Michel Galabru). Rebel at heart that 
he is, Manolo curses the fact that he's potent only with his indomitable wife, 
who's constantly sailing off to one disastrous concert tour after another.  
</P>
<P>
 Trueba casts us into a ribald "You Can't Take It With You," but subtly reminds 
us that like life, liberty itself can be fleeting. Trueba's people, meanwhile, 
are too joyously partaking of life, speaking as freely as they make love, to 
realize how special this interlude is in which for once life pretty much 
proceeds the way it ought to. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Spanish audiences are unquestionably at an advantage in regard to 
the film's political context and its literary allusions, "Belle Epoque" surely 
possesses a warm, universal appeal. Trueba embraces his cast so affectionately 
that in spirit the sly, confident veterans Gomez, Ramirez and Galabru are as 
youthful as the cast's good-looking and talented young actors. With its 
gorgeous settings, whimsical score and robust yet dark-tinged good humor, 
"Belle Epoque" is sure to be a strong contender for best foreign film.

MUSIC REVIEW; SOME ALLURING NEW SOUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The good, the bad and the boring often mix indiscriminately at new music 
concerts. For every piece illuminated by joy or invention, it seems, one must 
endure another constructed out of formula, cliche or tired reiteration. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so the second Green Umbrella event of 1994, Monday night in the Japan 
America Theatre. On the agenda were six strong works, one a classic, the other 
five recent, provocative and engrossing. The composers -- what, no Schnittke? 
-- were Steven Stucky, Gyorgy Ligeti, Gyorgy Kurtag, Bernard Rands and Arnold 
Schoenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, since the nearly two dozen participating players comprised the 
current membership of the Los Angeles Philharmonic New Music Group -- with two 
splendid vocal guests -- the performances, led by Stucky and by Esa-Pekka 
Salonen, L.A. Philharmonic Orchestra music director, were viable and polished. 
More than that, they proved consistently committed. The faint and familiar odor 
of incomplete preparation never once arose. 
</P>
<P>
 Stucky, the Philharmonic's new music advisor, conducted his two pieces, 
"Sappho Fragments" of 1982 and "Four Poems of A.R. Ammons" of 1992, in which 
the vocal soloists were soprano Judith Kellock and baritone Sanford Sylvan, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Both works strike the ear with compelling sincerity, haunting lyricism and an 
inexorable sense of continuity. Ammons' texts, in particular, as delivered with 
perfect enunciation and coloration by Sylvan, grip the listener through their 
command and cogency; Stucky's instrumental settings -- for six players -- 
provide well-gauged emotional counterpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 The similarly engaging "Sappho" songs -- though sparse and episodic, they are 
in texture the opposite of arid -- received comprehensive, touching readings 
from Kellock and a quintet of New Music Group regulars. After intermission, 
Kellock joined violinist Elizabeth Baker in Kurtag's nine-minute, seven-item, 
proto-surreal cycle, "S.K. -- Remembrance Noise," a difficult and complex work 
the two women sailed through without glibness. 
</P>
<P>
 In their Los Angeles premieres, violist Evan Wilson played two challenging but 
mournful solo pieces by Ligeti, "Facsar" and "Loop."  
</P>
<P>
 This generous evening offered two resting places, entremets, as it were. In 
the first half, the two Ligeti pieces served that function; in the second, it 
was accomplished by Rands' bucolic quintet, " . . . in the receding mist . . . 
" played affectionately by flutist Anne Diener Giles, harpist Lou Anne Neill, 
violinist Elizabeth Baker, violist John Hayhurst and cellist Daniel Rothmuller. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end, there was Schoenberg's bracing Chamber Symphony No. 1, led 
breezily by Salonen, played expertly by 15 instrumentalists of the orchestra.

PERFORMANCE REVIEW; A WELL-VERSED FOURSOME 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's ironic that the man who wrote "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" 
would headline the "Free Your Mind Spoken Word Tour" -- a road show sponsored 
by television force MTV. Nevertheless, Gil Scott-Heron's politicized urban 
poetry fit in well at the Troubadour on Monday, in a four-artist show that 
emphasized the performance of verse as well as its content. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing a keyboard and backed by a percussionist, Scott-Heron -- an 
influential veteran whose '70s records were a precursor of rap -- sang rather 
than spoke for almost all of his set. Purists might gripe that this set-up was 
hardly the essence of spoken word, but it was hard to argue with the poignancy 
his playing brought to such songs as "Winter in America," or with the soulful 
groove he created. 
</P>
<P>
 The influence of rap on the spoken word genre was especially apparent during a 
powerful set by New York-based poet Reg E. Gaines, who used hip-hop's style and 
urgency to perform pieces about issues such as urban violence.  
</P>
<P>
 Leading a three-piece band and prowling around the stage with the energy of a 
punk rocker, Maggie Estep -- one of the most high-profile figures on the 
poetry-reading scene -- spoke, sang and screamed poems that combined the 
personal and the political with a cynical, razor-sharp wit. 
</P>
<P>
 John S. Hall, singer for the alternative rock band King Missile, performed his 
work more traditionally, using backing drums on only two numbers. He read 
absurdist short pieces as well as lyrics to King Missile songs in a deadpan 
tone that made his dark humor all the more affecting. ROBERT LEVINE

DEAF MAN AGREES TO 2ND-DEGREE MURDER PLEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a case marked by a host of hearing-impaired participants and a crew of sign 
language interpreters, a deaf man agreed Tuesday to a deal with prosecutors 
that will result in his murder conviction in the shooting of a rival gang 
member, who also was deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than two weeks of pretrial motions and with a jury waiting for 
opening statements, Val Lamar Smith, 23, of South-Central Los Angeles, waived 
his right to a trial and agreed that a judge would convict him in a seldom-used 
procedure known as a "slow plea." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Michael J. Farrell, who also has a significant 
hearing loss in both ears, scheduled a Thursday hearing where he will formally 
find Smith guilty of second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith will receive a sentence of 15 years to life in state prison for the 
slaying of James E. Powell Jr., a 27-year-old deaf man from Long Beach who was 
gunned down Jan. 10, 1992, in a Van Nuys apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think they were arguing over gang colors, but we can't be sure," said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Shellie Samuels. 
</P>
<P>
 If the case had gone to trial, prosecutors would have asked a jury to convict 
Smith of first-degree murder, even though they privately admitted this outcome 
would have been unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 While prosecutors saw the slaying as the depressingly familiar result of a 
gang conflict, the case was unique because the defendant, the victim and many 
of the witnesses are deaf and use an informal sign language that requires the 
use of two interpreters. 
</P>
<P>
 For Smith to speak with his attorney, Tony Bryan, he flashed signs to an 
informal interpreter, who also is deaf. That first translator then gestured to 
an American Sign Language interpreter, who would then verbally speak to Bryan. 
For Bryan to speak to his client, the process was reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to avoiding the potential outcome of conviction of first-degree 
murder, Smith and his attorney agreed to Tuesday's deal after Farrell ruled 
that the jury in the case could hear an incriminating statement Smith made to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan and Samuels spent seven court days discussing the confession and the 
finer points of law involving a suspect's Miranda rights, in which, among other 
things, arresting officers must advise him of his right to an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue in Smith's case was whether an American Sign Language interpreter 
correctly translated his statement concerning his desire for an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did not waive his rights" at the beginning of the interview, Farrell said. 
"He did ask for a lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Smith clearly stated that he wanted an attorney and police 
continued to question him -- in apparent violation of the law -- Farrell ruled 
Tuesday the confession he made to police was admissible as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 To support his ruling, the judge found that investigators acted in good faith 
because the American Sign Language interpreter created an ambiguity when she 
told detectives that Smith said, "I prefer to go to court, and I want a 
lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 Police did not understand at what point he wanted the attorney, Farrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the interview, Smith eventually waived his Miranda rights and told 
police that he fired two shots into Powell's leg and body, insisting that he 
did not fire the fatal shot to the victim's head. 
</P>
<P>
 "The detectives did nothing wrong in the way they handled the case," Farrell 
said while acknowledging that an appeals court may disagree with his ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very close call by the judge," Samuels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan said an appeal based on the judge's ruling would be filed as soon as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he pleaded guilty he would give up his right to appeal the judge's 
decision," Samuels said, explaining the use of the "slow plea." 
</P>
<P>
 In the rarely used "slow plea" procedure -- where a judge considers various 
documents and finds the accused person guilty -- a defendant maintains certain 
constitutional rights that must be waived when pleading guilty outright. 
</P>
<P>
 If Farrell's decision involving Smith's constitutional rights is overturned, 
his conviction also would be overturned. If the case is sent back to Farrell's 
court, Samuels told the defendant he would be prosecuted for first-degree 
murder, a crime that carries a penalty of 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Another deaf man who accompanied Smith to the apartment where Powell was 
killed, 28-year-old Howard Love, pleaded guilty last year to voluntary 
manslaughter. Prosecutors agreed to a plea bargain and a three-year prison 
sentence for Powell in exchange for his testimony against Smith. That no longer 
is needed.

FATHER AND SON QUIETLY BURIED; FUNERAL: ABOUT 300 ATTEND SERVICE TO REMEMBER 
STEVEN AND CHRISTOPHER GOLLY IN HAPPIER DAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER and CHAU LAM, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A minister told mourners who gathered Tuesday for the funeral of Christopher 
Golly that the Northridge teen-ager should not be remembered solely for "the 
last chapter" of his life -- the shooting rampage in which he killed his 
father, a policewoman and himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "A person's life cannot be summed up in the events of one day," Rev. Craige Le 
Breton told about 300 people crowded into a chapel for the private funeral for 
Christopher and his father, Steven, at Conejo Mountain Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We remember not simply the last chapter. We remember all the chapters that 
came before." 
</P>
<P>
 The quiet ceremony was in stark contrast with one attended Monday by thousands 
of mourners -- including 3,500 police officers, Gov. Pete Wilson and Mayor 
Richard Riordan -- for Los Angeles Police Officer Christy Hamilton. Golly 
killed Hamilton with one rifle shot after he slew his father and then lured 
police to the Golly home with a 911 call, before committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 While Hamilton was honored with a 21-gun salute and was remembered as a brave 
woman who had recently achieved her long-held dream of becoming a police 
officer, the eulogy for Christopher Golly, 17, concentrated on his promising 
preteen years, before he developed emotional problems and became a heavy user 
of Methedrine, or "speed." 
</P>
<P>
 Le Breton referred to Christopher Even Golly as a "Bicentennial baby," born in 
1976 and coincidently the 1,976th baby born at Northridge Hospital Medical 
Center. He said Christopher was an honor student at Pinecrest School. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a quiet person," the pastor said. "He was creative in writing. He 
wrote poetry." 
</P>
<P>
 Family friends have said in interviews that Christopher began to change four 
years ago when his mother died of a cocaine overdose. He became lax in his 
schoolwork, was eventually put in a special program for troubled students and 
was convicted of marijuana possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Ray Golly, 47, was remembered by Le Breton as a native of Los Angeles 
who began his successful career in the electrical supply business after a brief 
stint in the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 (Although friends earlier described Golly as a Vietnam veteran, service 
records obtained by the Times showed that Golly was discharged before 
completing boot camp.) 
</P>
<P>
 Le Breton noted that Steven was known to his friends as hospitable and a great 
cook, but also as a man who had "strong opinions." 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps, we might sum it up by saying that he was a man who expected much of 
himself and of many others," the pastor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship between father and son deteriorated in recent years, friends 
say, with Christopher threatening his father. The one recreation they enjoyed 
together was target practice in Angeles National Forest with the guns in 
Steven's collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher used a semiautomatic rifle his father had given him to kill both 
Steven and Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other speaker at the half-hour service was Christopher's friend, 
James Gates, who said in a voice cracking with emotion that "no matter what I 
was up against," he could count on Christopher for support. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members at the funeral included Steven's mother, Eleanor, who lives in 
Camarillo, and his sister, Karen Wharton, who lives in La Crescenta. Also 
attending were the other three people in the house when the rampage began -- 
Susan Bever, Steven's girlfriend for the past three years; her son, Aaron 
Bever, and Aaron's girlfriend, Connie McGovern. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven and Christopher were laid to rest in identical caskets in adjoining 
graves. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's pallbearers included several of his close friends, including 
Alon Karpovsky of Granada Hills. "I was keeping myself from thinking of the 
memories we shared because I would most likely cry," said Karpovsky, 16, after 
the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking, 'I am carrying Chris in my hand.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the ceremony, several of Christopher's friends climbed into a 
van in front of the chapel to change from their dark, comparatively formal 
outfits into shorts and T-shirts, then cranked up rap music on the stereo and 
headed for the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 As they left, Karpovsky considered what he would say to Christopher if his 
friend was still alive. "I'd say, 'Dude, keep on fighting, don't quit,' " 
Karpovsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'There is a lot of partying we still have to do.' "

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: MILKEN CAMPUS SERVICES RELOCATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most programs offered at the Bernard Milken Jewish Community Campus have been 
relocated to a former warehouse near Warner Center while earthquake damage at 
the permanent location is repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20,000-square-foot temporary site on Independence Avenue in Woodland Hills 
will be used until repairs are completed, said Earl Greinetz, president of the 
San Fernando Valley Alliance of the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los 
Angeles. The campus is operated by the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the damage caused by the earthquake was due to ruptured water and 
sprinkler lines indoors, Greinetz said, and the West Hills campus may be 
reopened as soon as late this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the earthquake, the 6-year-old campus had been scheduled to close 
this spring for several months for roof repairs and seismic reinforcement, 
Greinetz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had begun the relocation process, starting with the children's services," 
Greinetz said. "Then the earthquake hit and we had no choice but to relocate 
right away." 
</P>
<P>
 The roof and other structural repairs were deemed necessary by a team of 
private engineers last December. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were deficiencies in the construction of the buildings," said Robert 
Powell of the engineering firm Powell, Mika & Associates. "They weren't built 
according to the plans and would have come under the hazardous building 
(designation)." 
</P>
<P>
 As programs such as the West Valley Jewish Community Center, the Jewish 
Vocational Service and the Jewish Family Service of Los Angeles were forced to 
scramble to a new location, the umbrella group linking them also underwent a 
major reorganization -- along with a name change, Greinetz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley Alliance of the Jewish Federation Council of Greater 
Los Angeles, formerly the San Fernando Valley Region of the Jewish Federation 
Council of Greater Los Angeles, gained control over its own budget and 
administration, becoming semiautonomous from the rest of the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were a 'region' of the larger council, we had to spend money in the 
way we were told," Greinetz said. "This is a step toward solving our problems 
of needing more responsibility." KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HILLS; MARATHONER'S MESSAGE WINS STUDENTS OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a message that schoolchildren hear all the time: stay in school, steer 
clear of drugs, dream big. 
</P>
<P>
 But coming from Arcenio Herrera, a top marathoner from Guatemala who now lives 
in Sherman Oaks, the message sounds a little more convincing than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be a champion in health in order to be a champion in anything," 
Herrera told several hundred children Tuesday at Lassen Elementary School less 
than a week before he will compete in the Los Angeles Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 He should know. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera, 33, has won the Guatemala marathon two times since he started running 
15 years ago and always finishes among the top five runners there. He ran in 
the Los Angeles Marathon last year, where he finished 37th, and the San 
Francisco Marathon in 1992, where he finished 19th. He's run in races from 
Italy to Puerto Rico with more than 500 trophies and 200 medals to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing high-cut shorts that revealed bulging quadriceps and the lightweight 
running shoes he usually saves for competition, Herrera spoke to students about 
the importance of a diet without drugs, alcohol, cigarettes or junk food. 
Speaking in Spanish as his wife Sylvia Shields Herrera served as interpreter, 
he urged students to respect their parents, stay in school and follow their 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned you can do anything you put your mind to," said 11-year-old Tameaka 
Garrett after Herrera spoke. "This was something he wanted to do and no one 
could stop him." 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in a small town about 20 miles from Guatemala City, Herrera began 
running marathons after watching his older brother become a champion. He was 18 
at the time and lived with his mother, who supported her five children by 
making and selling cheese. A rock of support and encouragement, his mother used 
to rise well before dawn on race days to prepare meals for her sons. When she 
died two years ago, Herrera moved to California hoping to ease his grief. He 
met Sylvia Shields, who has two daughters attending Lassen. The two were 
married in November. 
</P>
<P>
 On the playground, Herrera demonstrated how to breathe deeply and stretch 
before running. With a dozen children at his side, he jogged around the 
blacktop, his legs pumping in slow, fluid motions. Halfway around, without 
warning, Herrera took off in a full sprint, leaving the children far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's such a fast runner," said Lorenzo Gammage, watching as Herrera slowed 
his pace to a walk. "I want to get a healthy life so I'll be strong and fast 
like him." SUSAN BYRNES

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; TO X-RATED BIZ, 
TEMBLOR WAS HARDLY A JIGGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For those who contend that the Northridge earthquake was an expression of 
divine wrath at the San Fernando Valley as the national capital of the sex 
video business, think again. The studios that produce the adventures of 
cheerleader nurses were shaken up, but not enough to prevent a swift recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Pornographic tapes are a $3-billion-a-year industry in the Valley. Northridge, 
Chatsworth, Canoga Park, North Hollywood, Van Nuys, Reseda, Pacoima and San 
Fernando are home to about 65 production, duplication and distribution 
companies, many of which suffered damage ranging from cracked walls to trashed 
video-duplicating equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardest hit was VCA Pictures, the Chatsworth-based industry giant. VCA 
incurred damages of "$1 million and counting" when the roof of its DeSoto 
Street warehouse fell, according to Russ Hampshire, the company's president. 
</P>
<P>
 But recent reports of a Sodom and Gomorrah-style destruction of the sex-film 
trade were greatly exaggerated, say industry people and the police officers who 
investigate them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shut them down for about a week," said Detective Bob Peters of the Los 
Angeles Police Department, who heads the five-member Obscenity Enforcement 
Unit, commonly known as "Porno." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they're going anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Police estimate that about 80% of the 4 million X-rated videos distributed 
nationally are made in the Valley, and they account for about 11% of all video 
rentals nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing that it's God's retribution for having the adult video 
industry in the Valley, well, I don't think God brings death on anybody," said 
Hampshire. "Nobody in the adult industry died. The adult industry is here to 
stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider such very recent titles as "Naked Goddess," "My She-Male Valentine," 
"She Quest" and "Strap-on Sally." Their release was delayed -- but not denied 
-- by the Northridge quake, according to Paul Fishbein, publisher of Adult 
Video News, an industry trade magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though VCA's home of five years, an innocuous-looking warehouse at 9650 
DeSoto St., was red-tagged after the quake, it took only a week for the company 
to set up housekeeping in another warehouse nearby on Deering Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Hampshire said widely publicized reports that a security guard had been 
trapped in the rubble of his building were untrue. When the quake hit, 
Hampshire said, the guard "just took off" running. "I don't blame him. We were 
just concerned because we couldn't locate him." 
</P>
<P>
 VCA's product line includes the popular "Cheerleader Nurses" and "New Wave 
Hookers" series. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishbein said Cinderella Distributors and LBO Enterprises also suffered damage 
during the quake, mostly to video-duplicating machines. But like other Valley 
businesses, they cleaned up the mess and called their insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's an earthquake, really? Nothing," Fishbein said. "The government 
couldn't put us out of business, so we aren't going to let an earthquake do it. 
There's a certain toughness to the people in this business." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, police keep an eye on X-rated video makers, but they watch from 
farther away than they did a decade ago, said Detective Robert Navarro, who 
spent 10 years in the porno detail. The legal standards changed when the 
home-video boom of the 1980s brought the naughty nurses from the porn-movie 
palaces to the bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 In jaded Los Angeles, at least, adult videos lost their shock value. 
Prosecutors became more reluctant to file charges. And the X-rated video makers 
settled in the Valley, where, despite the occasional earthquake, they are still 
happily ensconced.  
</P>
<P>
 The Valley is, as they say, Hollywood-adjacent, with access to camera 
technicians, film labs, apprentice directors and the ever-replenished supply of 
can't-quite-make-it starlets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're here because the land is a little cheaper. The rent is a little 
cheaper," Navarro said. 
</P>
<P>
 And because a sizable segment of the public can't get enough of cheerleader 
nurses. Says Hampshire: 'We've had over 500 million rentals. That wasn't just 
one guy in an overcoat renting all those."

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: DISABLED ESPECIALLY HARD HIT BY QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People with disabilities are having a particularly hard time finding 
replacement housing in the wake of the earthquake, according to an advocate for 
the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Norma Vescovo, director of the Van Nuys-based Independent Living Center of 
Southern California, said Monday that low-income apartments were particularly 
hit hard by the earthquake, disproportionately hurting the disabled, many of 
whom live on fixed incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first two weeks of February, the center gained 180 clients, most with 
housing problems, Vescovo said. Before the Jan. 17 quake, the center signed up 
40 to 50 new clients a month on average. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is happening is that they're competing with all the people who are 
trying to find housing (and another problem is that) they are limited in their 
income," Vescovo said. "In addition, the place has to be accessible for their 
physical needs, so that narrows the scope of the places they can rent." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Small, chairwoman of the Los Angeles County Commission on Disabilities, 
said the quake made already limited housing stock even more difficult to find. 
</P>
<P>
 "Accessible housing is practically nonexistent to begin with," she said, and 
now disabled people are competing with others who were displaced for affordable 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 They are forced to live with friends and relatives, whose homes are often not 
wheelchair-accessible, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What independence they had is disappearing rapidly," Small said. 
</P>
<P>
 If landlords raise their rents to cover earthquake repair costs, that will 
exacerbate the problem, Vescovo said. One reason that it is difficult for 
people with disabilities to look for housing is that many of their friends and 
neighbors who would have helped by providing rides have been displaced by the 
quake. Debris on sidewalks has also posed an impediment to the disabled in 
getting around, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some disabled people mistakenly believe that they are not eligible for 
18-month emergency rent vouchers because their buildings were not condemned, 
Vescovo said. If their buildings have non-functioning elevators or blocked 
disabled-accessible entrances, disabled people have a right to the vouchers, 
she said. KAY HWANGBO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; WORK UNDER WAY ON FREEWAY INTERCHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After two decades of study and delays, a $15-million renovation of a crowded, 
1950s-era interchange between the Ventura Freeway and Valley Circle Boulevard 
is under way. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion of two freeway off-ramps and an overpass near Old Calabasas will 
help ease the often-congested interchange, said Jim McAllister, Caltrans 
engineer for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way the area has been built up, there is a lot of traffic on this 
interchange," McAllister said. "And it looks like there's going to be a lot 
more."  
</P>
<P>
 The project is scheduled to include the alteration of ramps on both sides of 
the freeway and the expansion of the Valley Circle overpass to include five 
traffic lanes, two five-foot bike lanes and a 10-foot equestrian pathway. 
Groundwork began in January, and the job is expected to be complete by October, 
1995, McAllister said. 
</P>
<P>
 The renovation also will require the removal of several oak trees near the 
historic Leonis Adobe. To preserve the rustic appeal of the area as much as 
possible, crews will install sound walls and plant eight new oaks, according to 
a Caltrans report. 
</P>
<P>
 The improvements were the subject of 20 years of study and four years of 
compromises between Caltrans and local residents, who had been concerned that 
the expanded interchange could wreck the picturesque nature of the city's 
historic core. KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; PROPOSED PRESCHOOL WITHSTANDS APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed Northridge preschool and day-care center won a tentative victory 
after a city zoning panel failed to support an appeal against it Tuesday. But 
opponents didn't even take the time to rise from their chairs before declaring 
their intention to challenge the decision further. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Rothenberg, past president of the North Valley Homeowners' Federation, 
said the group will file an appeal to the Los Angeles City Council to prevent 
Sherri Segre, a Northridge day-care center operator, from converting a home 
into a preschool for 36 children in the 18800 block of Devonshire Street. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Segre won preliminary approval for a conditional-use permit for 
the school. Homeowners took their appeal to the Los Angeles Board of Zoning 
Appeals, but Tuesday's 2-2 vote by the board means that Segre will get her 
permit unless the homeowners persuade the City Council to take action. 
</P>
<P>
 Segre may face a tough battle if the case goes before the council. The 
homeowners have succeeded in winning over City Councilman Hal Bernson, chairman 
of the influential Planning and Land-Use Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The case pitted a group of retirees against Segre, herself the mother of a 
young child. It is one of several recent cases in which proposed child-care 
centers met substantial neighborhood opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Valley homeowners argued that there were already plenty of 
child-care centers in the area and that Segre's property, with its circular 
driveway opening onto Devonshire Street, would cause traffic snarls. And they 
argued that approval of the school would open the door to additional commercial 
uses in the neighborhood. 
</P>

 "It's not that we don't like children," said neighbor Char Faber. "It's just 
that if you let one thing go. . . ."

 But John Parker, the associate zoning administrator who reviewed the case, 
said Segre's property was in a "perfect location" because the neighborhood is 
neither too quiet nor too busy.

 Board Chairman Peter Weil and James Silcott voted to deny the appeal. Member 
Chris Kezios and Joyce Perkins voted to support it. JILL LEOVY

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; ALARCON WANTS FENCE FOR RAILROAD TRACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of another fatal accident on the Metrolink rail line, Los Angeles 
City Councilman Richard Alarcon has said he will urge transit officials to 
fence off the rail right of way. 
</P>
<P>
 The fence would border both sides of the tracks in the northeast San Fernando 
Valley's 7th Council District, from Sun Valley to Sylmar, and would be part of 
a broader beautification plan being prepared for the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority, Alarcon said.Only a two-mile stretch of the tracks in 
the Sylmar-San Fernando area now has such fencing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eleven of the 15 people killed on Metrolink tracks have been killed in my 
district," Alarcon said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent death last Thursday, a pedestrian was struck as he walked 
onto the tracks about 40 feet north of a designated rail crossing at San 
Fernando Road and Sunland Boulevard in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County coroner's office has declared seven of the 15 Metrolink 
deaths suicides. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the fatalities occurred at protected and designated crossings and thus 
had little to do with fencing, Metrolink spokesman Ray Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sure it will do good in some places, but we're not sure it will do good 
everywhere," Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink last year placed two miles of wrought-iron fence along the rail 
corridor from Polk Street to the Pacoima Wash in the Sylmar-San Fernando area 
at a cost of about $900,000, according to Mark Dierking, an MTA project 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding is not available for similar projects, Dierking said, but MTA is not 
giving up on the concept. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to piece together funding in various ways," he said. "We're 
talking with the council about putting a bike lane along the track, which would 
include putting fences along the rail." GEOFFREY MOHAN

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; HOUSING AUTHORITY HEARS SUGGESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Neighborhoods that lack adequate parks, retail and supermarket services 
because of rapid growth in the 1980s must be transformed into 
pedestrian-friendly places to live, John McKenna, Glendale planning director, 
told a meeting of the city Housing Authority on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to put back a sense of neighborhood into areas where no neighborhoods 
are identifiable," McKenna said. "The way to do so is to build parks and 
supermarkets that residents can walk to, giving them the feeling they live in a 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 The authority is searching for ways to cope not only with a 29% jump in 
population between 1980 and 1990, but also with projections that growth will 
eventually exceed General Plan provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Authority members will develop a citywide housing strategy after hearing 
presentations from the Chamber of Commerce, parks, school and police officials, 
the board of realtors and neighborhood associations. 
</P>
<P>
 This strategy will attempt to improve existing housing and to provide more 
affordable rental and homeownership opportunities, said Madalyn Blake, 
community development and housing director, in a report to City Manager David 
Ramsay. 
</P>
<P>
 With 187,000 residents, Glendale is the third largest city in Los Angeles 
County, falling below Los Angeles and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We added 41,000 people, or approximately the size of Azusa or West Covina, to 
the city between 1980 and 1990. We continue to have significant growth in the 
1990s," said Jim Glaser, city planning services administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 This growth has caused a 52% increase in elementary school enrollment and a 
10% increase in students attending the city's high schools. Growth also spurred 
a dramatic increase in household size, leading to 18% of the city's households 
being defined as overcrowded, according to a city report. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's General Plan places a cap on population at 225,000. Although it is 
difficult to say when and by how much this cap will be exceeded, Glaser said it 
is likely that Glendale's population could grow to as much as 250,000 because 
of past development practices that allowed multifamily construction to exceed 
density limits now in place. JENNIFER OLDHAM

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; FEMA DRAWS CRITICISM FOR CARE OF DISABLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to complaints that the Federal Emergency Management Agency did not 
appropriately address the needs of disabled victims of the Northridge 
earthquake, the head of the agency's civil rights arm said FEMA would try to be 
more responsive in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure there are lessons that can be learned," said Alan Clive, speaking at 
a forum on the agency's response to the Jan. 17 quake at the Independent Living 
Center in Van Nuys. "It's going to help us to help people if the disabled 
community can come to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Clive, who is blind, said he was considering implementing sensitivity training 
for FEMA staff and hiring someone from the disabled community to act as a 
liaison in future disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency is working on a training manual to help disabled-service agencies 
prepare for a disaster, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing, at Clive's request, featured leaders from a variety of nonprofit 
groups serving people with disabilities, including the National Multiple 
Sclerosis Society, Crippled Children's Society and the Greater Los Angeles 
Council on Deafness. 
</P>
<P>
 Heidi Kleiger, program manager for the Council on Deafness, said it was a 
challenge just to ask FEMA what special services were available for the 
hearing-impaired. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spent more than one week trying to contact the right person at FEMA," 
Kleiger said through a sign-language interpreter. "It was very frustrating for 
us to get assistance to the deaf community. The Telephone Device for the Deaf 
Line was always busy." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the FEMA centers were wheelchair-accessible to people with 
disabilities, several advocates said their clients had trouble getting to and 
from the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had mobility problems in getting to the . . . centers," said Cynthia 
Vicknair, emergency services and advocacy coordinator for the Independent 
Living Center. "I think it's an issue FEMA needs to take care of as far as 
providing some form of transportation." 
</P>
<P>
 Another speaker complained that some staff at FEMA's Disaster Assistance 
Centers were not well-trained in dealing with the special needs of the 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Kambouris, FEMA's liaison for community-based organizations for the 
Northridge earthquake relief effort, said the agency did have a team of three 
people assigned specifically to contact and aid disabled-service groups. JEFF

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: EL PROYECTO LOOKS TO EXPAND OPERATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 The devastation and desperation wrought by the Northridge earthquake has 
spurred a human-services group to expand its plans for a needy neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Proyecto del Barrio clinic on Van Nuys Boulevard, a fixture in the 
Pacoima area for more than a decade, was nearly destroyed by the Jan. 17 
temblor.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, the organization's board of directors has decided moving back in is not 
enough. They want to purchase or construct their own building, said Corinne 
Sanchez, president and CEO of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened was we wanted to get back to where we were, but we said, 'Let's 
be better than we were,' " said Sanchez. "It's something the board has been 
talking about for a few years. This just kicked it in." 
</P>
<P>
 Building inspectors have restricted access to the clinic building, which is 
now being used only to store supplies, Sanchez said. In the meantime, doctors 
have been treating about 50 patients a day from a motor home, according to 
clinic Director Corrie Alvarez. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks immediately following the quake, medical personnel used the 
borrowed motor home parked in front of the shattered office to treat more than 
double their normal caseload of clients, for quake-related injuries, illnesses 
and stress.  
</P>
<P>
 El Proyecto provides a variety of programs aimed at problems such as AIDS, 
pregnant women and troubled youth, and does not usually give away food or 
clothing. But it did both during the earthquake crisis, drawing as many as 400 
people per day to the Pacoima clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez said the overwhelming demand for help following the quake reaffirmed 
her group's commitment to the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a helpful situation for the community, because it's drawn more attention 
to its long-term needs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It could take more than a year to either purchase the repaired building or 
find another prospect, Sanchez said. In the meantime, the health clinic -- 
which has operated out of its rented quarters for the past 14 years -- will 
have to work in a modular office similar to a portable classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The group must first obtain funding through the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency; next it must get permission to open a new clinic from the California 
Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the quake, state health officials promised to supply a portable 
clinic within two weeks -- until they found out the process was more 
complicated, Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they meant well, but the reality is they couldn't do it," she said. 
"It's all time. In the meantime, what do you do? We just struggle with what we 
have." GEOFFREY MOHAN

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH CELEBRATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Glendale College kicked off its celebration of Women's History Month on 
Tuesday with a campy "Battle of the Sexes" and the showing of a documentary 
about domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 In its eighth year, the event emphasizes women's accomplishments and 
highlights issues of concern to women through classroom presentations and 
evening performances, said Dr. Peggy Renner, its coordinator and a history 
teacher at Glendale College. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Battle of the Sexes" involved a panel of three male and three female 
students who were asked stereotypical questions about the opposite sex. For 
example, women were asked about sports, and men were asked about makeup. The 
day's events also included a showing of "Defending Our Lives," a videotape 
about domestic violence that will be shown throughout the month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prairie Winds," a program by performance artist Delia Dreis, who will 
dramatize the harrowing experiences of 11 pioneer women, is slated March 17 and 
18. Discussions and presentations are scheduled throughout the month on such 
topics as the gender gap in pay, combining motherhood and career, feminism, 
women and success, how advertising affects women and rape awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in a world that has traditionally shown us the accomplishments of 
men. We want to show that women too can be scientists, mathematicians and 
athletes," Renner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The college began celebrating Women's History Month after then-President 
Ronald Reagan issued an executive order in 1983 denoting March as a time to 
celebrate women's history. 
</P>
<P>
 All events are open to the public. JENNIFER OLDHAM

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; GADFLY'S RESTITUTION APPEAL IS DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A noted Burbank gadfly who contended he was wrongly evicted from property 
later bought by the city lost an appeal for restitution early Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Jules Kimmett's request for relocation benefits was rejected by the city's 
Relocation Appeals Board just after midnight Tuesday morning, after a 3 
1/2-hour meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals board ruled against Kimmett in a 4-1 vote, saying that although he 
had been evicted from the property, which was eventually purchased by the city, 
the negotiations for that purchase had not begun until a month after he left 
the Olive Avenue apartment in August, 1990. City officials said the building's 
owner, Tyler Eschrich, had originally evicted his tenants not because he 
planned to sell the site to the city, but because he intended to renovate the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is now building senior citizens housing on the site, where Kimmett 
had lived for 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimmett is a well-known figure in Burbank government, always appearing at City 
Council meetings with a yellow shirt that reads, "We have the best council 
money can buy." At the end of the pledge of allegiance, Kimmett usually shouts 
"with liberty and justice for all." 
</P>
<P>
 Redevelopment law requires municipalities to provide relocation assistance to 
tenants who live in a building when negotiations to buy the property have 
begun. Ted McConkey, a friend of Kimmett's who presented the case for him in 
Monday's hearing, argued that those negotiations between the city and had begun 
in either May or April of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Another issue behind Kimmett's case is that if the city were to lose the 
claim, that the tenants in another seven apartments evicted from the building 
might also be entitled to money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe in some way the city can ensure that next time, not so many people will 
fall through the cracks," Matthews said at the conclusion of the hearing. The 
claim will now go to the City Council for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 If Kimmett eventually wins, a separate hearing would have to be held to 
determine how much is owed to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to get mad," Kimmett said after stepping into the hallway after 
the hearing. "I'm going to get even." ED BOND

STUDENTS HOLD RALLY FOR OUSTED PRINCIPAL; PROTEST: PARENTS ALSO ATTEND 
DEMONSTRATION URGING REINSTATEMENT OF BURBANK HIGH SCHOOL'S KEIKO HENTELL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Following the close of classes Tuesday at Burbank High School, a small cluster 
of students and parents gathered to wave signs and give speeches supporting 
Keiko Hentell, who is being forced out of her job as principal after three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call on the board to reinstate Keiko Hentell," said Kimalica 
Guynes-Peters, a parent and an organizer of the Young Black Scholars student 
group at Burbank High. She was supported by a group of about 15 student 
supporters of Hentell. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the school board announced its decision not to renew Hentell's 
contract, instead offering her a position as an English teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Students, teachers and community leaders who support Hentell have speculated 
that Hentell's removal was in reaction to her policy supporting ethnic groups 
and clubs at the high school. Others reject that theory, saying her management 
style fostered faculty dissension. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an ethnic diversity issue," Board President Elena Hubbell said 
Tuesday afternoon. "It's absolutely not and I am tired of hearing that." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's rally, at which students wore signs that read, "We're Here 4 U Mrs. 
Hentell" and "We Love You," and badges that used the words "People Respect 
Integrity and Diversity in Education," for the acronym PRIDE, was expected to 
be a prelude to Thursday night's board meeting, where her supporters are 
expected to demand that Hentell be reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hubbell said that the board would not reverse its decision. "We did not 
make this decision frivolously . . . and we stand together with this decision," 
Hubbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't make our decisions on one issue," said Hubbell, who would not say 
why Hentell's contract was terminated. "We make a decision on a combination of 
factors." 
</P>
<P>
 Students at the demonstration spoke of Hentell's "motivated, eager 
personality," which they said had been a driving factor at the school for three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 When the decision to release her became public, Hentell released a memo from 
Pierce that criticized her "decision-making process and relationships within 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
 She said during an interview then that there had been personality problems 
among faculty members last year, but said "we solved the problem" this year. 
"As far as I knew, that goal was met. I found that this school year has been 
much more productive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, teachers who left Burbank High School at the end of the past school 
year were not surprised by Hentell's removal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was proud of the school board for having the courage to take this step, 
when it seemed likely that there would be a cry that discrimination and ethnic 
diversity was at issue," said Julia Vetrie, an English teacher who said she 
transferred to John Burroughs High School because Hentell's leadership style 
fostered faculty dissension. 
</P>
<P>
 "She infuriated quite a few people," said Barry Silver, a Burbank High teacher 
who is on a leave of absence. "She had the faculty up in arms about seemingly 
trivial things."

PRIVATE AMBULANCES OKD FOR SOME 911 CALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to dispatch private ambulance firms to low-priority 911 calls -- such 
as stubbed toes and stomachaches -- won preliminary support Tuesday from the 
Los Angeles Board of Fire Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, private ambulances would be used to respond to about 
40,000 of the 230,000 calls that the city Fire Department receives annually 
through the 911 system. They would be able to collect city-approved fees for 
the services they provide. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of using private ambulance firms was tested during a 1991 pilot 
program in the San Fernando Valley after a management audit found that most 911 
emergency medical calls do not require the services of trained paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest move to privatize city services was praised by Fire Department 
supervisors and union representatives as a way to help meet a demand for 
services that they say continues to grow, particularly as poor, uninsured 
residents use the 911 system as a last resource for medical services. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of current funding shortages, Fire Chief Donald O. Manning said the 
department can't hire the extra staff needed to meet the growing workload. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see us getting into the major numbers of people in the department 
that we need . . . to handle the current workload," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Ken Buzzell, president of the city's firefighters' union, said he 
supports the program because paramedics often find themselves responding to 
calls from someone who has stepped on a nail or needs his or her temperature 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the kind of calls we are talking about, if the ambulance companies want 
to buy them, they have my blessing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To gauge the success of the Valley's 1991 pilot program, the department 
surveyed firefighters as well as patients who used private firms. They found 
that at least 90% were satisfied with the services offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Although preliminary estimates projected a savings of up to $6 million if the 
program were to succeed on a citywide basis, fire officials now believe that it 
will simply break even because the city will lose out on the fees that it would 
normally have collected for paramedic services. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, fire board Vice President David W. Fleming said the program could 
reduce the department's response time to real medical emergencies by freeing 
paramedics from having to answer non-emergency calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will improve the efficiency that we have today in answering . . . real 
emergency calls," he said. "With heart attacks and lives at stake, that is key 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
 If the program wins final board approval in two weeks and is adopted by the 
City Council and the mayor in April, it can be implemented as early as June or 
July, fire officials said.

 Admitting that his testimony may turn out to be a mistake, a prison parolee 
accused of executing an armored car guard during a robbery in a San Fernando 
Home Depot store took the witness stand at his trial Tuesday and proclaimed his 
innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding up graphic autopsy photos, defense attorney Bruce Hills conceded that 
guard Edwin Maldonado "was brutally murdered" on July 20, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would you agree with that?" Hill asked the accused killer, Dean Darnell 
Slade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Slade responded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you kill him?" Hill asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Slade replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade, who faces the death penalty if convicted, devoted most of his testimony 
to outlining his alibi for a jury of seven men and five women in Van Nuys 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade testified that he was visiting friends and running errands the afternoon 
that Maldonado was shot in the back of the head by a robber. 
</P>
<P>
 The guard had just picked up $82,000 -- about half in cash and half in checks 
-- and was still inside the Home Depot at 12960 Foothill Blvd. when a gunman 
ran up behind him and fired. Witnesses said Maldonado had just started to turn 
around when he was hit. The gunman then put two more bullets into the guard's 
head as he lay on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade admitted he was previously convicted of manslaughter and had been 
paroled from state prison only 25 days before the Home Depot robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 When he first took the witness stand, Slade told the jury that Hill had in no 
way coached his answers, adding, "As far as I know, it's the wrong thing to 
take the stand, being the one accused." 
</P>
<P>
 When Hill asked him why he insisted on testifying, Slade paused for nearly a 
minute and wiped tears from his eyes. "I think basically when this all began, I 
didn't take it as serious as it was," he said in a wavering voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade denied telling a man, who testified as a prosecution witness, that he 
had set up a "lick" to get money so he could purchase a "dope sack." 
</P>
<P>
 While his story of what he did on July 20, 1992, was essentially the same as 
testimony he gave at a preliminary hearing less than one month after the 
killing, some details of Slade's testimony contradicted the versions given by 
other witnesses, including that of his mother and a close friend. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a Home Depot employee who was standing just feet away from 
Maldonado when he was shot emphatically testified earlier in the trial that 
Slade was the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Jonas, who will be cross-examining Slade this 
afternoon, said he would overlook the contradictions for now. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was going to bother with every inconsistency, we'd be here for a week," 
the prosecutor said, adding that Slade would have to be Superman to do 
everything he claims to have done the day of the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Jonas said he would focus on Slade's state of mind after being 
released from prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing arguments in the case are scheduled for Monday.

MAN GETS PRISON IN EMBEZZLEMENT, FRAUD CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Sherman Oaks businessman was sentenced to five years in state prison 
and ordered to pay more than $1.5 million in restitution after he pleaded 
guilty to 23 counts of embezzlement and fraud, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charles Horan handed down the sentencing for 
Fred Lee Falk, 57, who had surrendered to authorities Jan. 24.Falk, who was 
indicted in December, had operated United Mortgage Inc. until he left the state 
in December, 1990, said Allan C. Fork, a Los Angeles County deputy district 
attorney in the major fraud division. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in 1985, Falk sold mortgage notes and secured nearly two dozen 
business loans and trust deeds without assets to cover his clients' 
investments, Fork said. In most cases, the clients invested between $10,000 and 
$50,000 each, Fork said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Falk used the money of clients who came on board later to 
secure the investments of people who had provided funds early on. He also used 
a $150,000 equity loan drawn against his Marina del Rey home to cover clients' 
interest payments, Fork said. 
</P>
<P>
 Falk will begin serving his sentence immediately. CHIP JOHNSON

WOMAN TO STAND TRIAL OVER CAR CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A March 21 trial date has been scheduled for a North Hollywood woman accused 
of leading police on a high-speed chase through Van Nuys with her screaming 
5-year-old son in the passenger seat beside her, without a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
 Teresa Ann Weidenfeller, 33, pleaded not guilty Monday after being charged 
with seven misdemeanor counts, including child endangerment, hit-and-run 
driving and reckless driving that caused an injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving a 1985 Pontiac Firebird and hitting speeds up to 70 m.p.h., 
Weidenfeller ran stop signs and red lights during the pursuit Feb. 24 and hit 
two other cars, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The young boy, whose name was not released, "was crying and screaming 
hysterically," both during and after the chase, said Deputy City Atty. Richard 
Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
 Police initially stopped Weidenfeller on Van Nuys Boulevard, almost in front 
of the criminal courthouse, after observing her speeding and making unsafe lane 
changes, officers said. But when she handed officers her identification, she 
sped off and the chase began, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weidenfeller ran five red lights, according to a police report. 
</P>
<P>
 She was captured when police trapped her vehicle in a parking lot near Victory 
and Coldwater Canyon boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 Her son, although frightened, was not physically injured during the incident. 
The boy was turned over to his father's custody, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 During a search of Weidenfeller's car, police found a cocaine pipe. She was 
also charged with possessing drug paraphernalia.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 2 SLAIN BY GUNMAN IN APARTMENT PARKING LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An assailant killed a man sitting in a parked car early Tuesday, and then, 
ignoring her pleas for mercy, shot to death the woman driver who had attempted 
to flee on foot, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police do not know the motive in the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims, who police have not identified pending notification of relatives, 
were pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics at 12:02 a.m., said Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Irma Becerra. 
</P>
<P>
 The killer remains at large, Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence began about midnight in the parking lot of the Antelope Valley 
Apartments at 43454 32nd Street West, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told deputies that as the victims sat in a parked car, a man armed 
with a .44-caliber Magnum handgun approached the passenger side of the vehicle 
and through the car's rear passenger window shot the male victim in the head, 
Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who had been sitting in the driver's seat, ran out of the car but 
tripped and fell about 15 feet away from the vehicle, Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the assailant approached the woman, his gun still drawn, she began pleading 
for her life, Becerra said.  
</P>
<P>
 "She was saying, 'Please don't shoot me, I have three kids,' " Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man fired three times, striking the woman in the head, the hand and the 
upper torso, Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told authorities that the man then turned and calmly walked 30 or 40 
feet away, placed the pistol on the ground and kept walking, Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities recovered the gun, Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 The male victim was carrying several thousand dollars when he died, deputies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unknown whether either victim lived in the Antelope Valley Apartments or 
why the car in which they were shot was parked in the parking lot of the 
complex.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ANTELOPE VALLEY TRANSIT MAY ADD L.A. ROUTES; 
TRANSPORTATION: AGENCY IS CONSIDERING NEW COMMUTER LINES TO LAX, CENTURY CITY 
AND VAN NUYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the federal government willing to foot the bill, the Antelope Valley 
Transit Authority is considering expanding its commuter services and adding 
more runs south to the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides increasing the number of buses to downtown Los Angeles and the San 
Fernando Valley, AVTA may begin taking commuters to Van Nuys, Century City and 
the Los Angeles International Airport/Westchester area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commute by car to such areas is lengthy, congested and expensive," 
according to an AVTA report. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Northridge earthquake, AVTA has received numerous requests for 
commuter services to LAX and the other destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our investigating these areas is customer-driven," said Tim Galbraith, AVTA 
grants manager. "It's not something we've created in a vacuum here at the 
AVTA." 
</P>
<P>
 Commuter lines to LAX, Century City and Van Nuys have always been 
possibilities, but Galbraith said the quake "brought them to a different 
light." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the cost for the increased service, which for one year could be as 
much as $875,000 after fare revenues are taken into account, would be paid by 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Since FEMA has found commuter-related costs to be eligible for funding in the 
wake of the Jan. 17 earthquake, the agency would pay 90% of the cost of the 
added service during the first year. The state Office of Emergency Services 
would pay 75% of the remaining balance, leaving AVTA with a cost of only 
$22,000, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 AVTA Executive Director Bill Budlong said a consultant is evaluating the 
routes that may be added. A recommendation on the LAX run is expected next 
week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible, Budlong said, that not all three of the new commuter runs will 
be added or that the number of buses on the existing lines will be increased. 
Even though there would be little cost to the transit agency as long as FEMA 
says a disaster exists, after that the services would have to be 
self-supporting or be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA will fund the services, as long as they are being used, until the 
interchange of the Antelope Valley and Golden State freeways is returned to 
100% capacity.

<P>
 Supt. Troy Bramlett has announced that he will retire from the Saugus Union 
School District on Oct. 1, citing health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm old enough and worn out enough," joked Bramlett, 59. "I'm out of gas and 
leaking oil." 
</P>
<P>
 Bramlett said that he has had diabetes for four years, and that his doctor has 
recommended more exercise and less tension to help battle the symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can treat myself better if I'm retired," said Bramlett, who plans to play 
golf and fish once he retires. "I'm going to do everything I can to keep these 
(symptoms) under control." 
</P>
<P>
 Bramlett replaced Christopher Wilson in the district's $90,000-per-year post 
about 1 1/2 years ago. His two-year contract expires at the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
 Bramlett has a 37-year career in education, previously working as the Monterey 
County superintendent of schools for eight years and superintendent of the 
Pacific Grove Unified School District for 12 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saugus district has a $23-million budget and includes 10 elementary 
schools with about 6,450 students.

VALLEY BRIEFING: OIL PIPELINES; CARRYING CRUDE BELOW THE VALLEYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rupture of an oil pipeline during the Northridge earthquake has prompted 
some residents and public officials to call for extra safeguards on the lines 
that cross underneath the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Jan. 17 quake fractured an Arco pipeline on Wolfskill Street in San 
Fernando, the crude caught fire, seriously burned a man and charred 17 cars and 
a house. The line passes below O'Melveny Street School, but officials in San 
Fernando,, Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Unified School District are divided 
on how-and if-the line can be relocated. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the lines crossing the Valley are owned by Arco Oil and its 
subsidiaries. A pipeline owned by Mobil Oil, known as the M-70 line, was 
installed three years ago to replace an aging-and leaky-pipeline that was 
installed in 1929. Existing Lines 04,16,20,19,21 Line 1 Line 63 Line M-70 Owner

SUSPECTED BURGLAR SHOT BY POLICE IN SERIOUS CONDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A suspected burglar, who was shot by police after allegedly trying to run over 
an officer attempting to arrest him in West Hills, remained hospitalized 
Tuesday in serious condition, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hootan Safaee, 18, will be booked on suspicion of residential burglary and 
assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer, said Los Angeles Police 
Department spokesman Lt. John Dunkin.Safaee was being treated at Holy Cross 
Medical Center for a bullet wound to the left shoulder, Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plainclothes officers from the LAPD's elite anti-crime task force, known as 
COBRA, were conducting a surveillance operation Monday on Safaee when they 
allegedly saw him burglarize a home, Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers waited until the burglary was complete, then requested other 
police to assist them in stopping and arresting Safaee. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that Safaee lived nearby in the 7600 block of Woodlake Avenue, the 
officers headed in that direction to try to capture him. However, Safaee saw an 
officer and allegedly tried to drive off. When another officer showed up, the 
two blocked Safaee's car. One officer approached his car and tried to arrest 
him, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Safaee responded by putting his car in reverse and accelerating, striking the 
officer, Dunkin said. The officer, who was treated at a local hospital for a 
minor injury, fired one round at Safaee's car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Safaee put his car in forward and allegedly tried to get away again, the 
second officer also fired a shot.

MIKE PENNER: MIGHTY DUCKS NEED TO PAY PRICE FOR KARIYA, SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For five long months of watching and studying the daily habits of Canard 
clutchus grabus -- the Mighty Duck, as it is more commonly known -- we have 
been told to wait and see. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait until March. 
</P>
<P>
 See how the Ducks are doing then. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Ducks are anywhere near the playoffs, we have been told, management 
would then do the right thing, the honorable thing, and reward the blind 
devotion of those 17,174 zealots who fill Anaheim Arena every home game by 
signing top draft choice and folk-hero-waiting-to-happen Paul Kariya, just in 
time for a cavalry charge into the Stanley Cup tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the calendar on the wall says today is March 2. 
</P>
<P>
 The standings in the newspaper say the Ducks are within three points of the 
eighth and final playoff berth in the Western Conference, currently held by, of 
all people, the San Jose Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympics have been completed, meaning that Kariya, silver-medal star for 
Team Canada, is a free man. 
</P>
<P>
 So, as thumbs twiddle and fingers drum all over Orange County, the question 
goes up: 
</P>
<P>
 Where's Kariya? 
</P>
<P>
 The time has come to bring him in, suit him up, send him out there. The Ducks 
are down to the final 20 games of their regular season, down to a three-team 
race with the Sharks and the Kings, those still sleep-walking Stanley Cup 
finalists who haven't won a game since Feb. 11, when they beat the Ducks in 
Anaheim, 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Kings can't help themselves -- the canonization of St. McSorley has 
been postponed until further notice -- the Ducks have no such excuse. Their 
help is sitting in Boston right now, kicking back in his girlfriend's home, 
waiting for the Ducks to make him an offer he can't refuse. 
</P>
<P>
 As you might have read, Disney recently shook loose $2 million to buy another 
ice-skating Olympic silver medalist, Nancy Kerrigan, and put her to work Monday 
at Disney World. Kerrigan was to share a motorcade with Mickey Mouse for a 
"You're No. 2!" ticker-tape parade. Kerrigan complied -- barely. She griped to 
Mickey along the way that "this is the corniest thing I've ever done," 
complained that her arm was tired from too much waving and generally appeared 
so annoyed that a Disney operative had to remind her to "Smile, honey" before 
commencing a photo shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Michael Eisner noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, Kariya has to look like the steal of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 For $1.5 million, Kariya will skate for you, won't whine about it, will share 
the puck with his teammates, won't whine about it, will withstand bone-jarring 
body checks, won't whine about it, and has never expressed any aversion to car 
pooling with a guy in a mouse suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Kariya just might put Disney's hockey team in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Think about that. You know the Duck players and coaches already have. Risking 
scorn and ridicule, the team had "Skate For Eight" T-shirts printed back in 
October, when hockey was still a novelty item in these parts and a 40-point 
season seemed an impossible dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Ducks have 53 points and 24 victories, placing them within striking 
distance of the NHL expansion team record (31 victories) as well as the 
playoffs, which have eluded every NHL expansion team since the league doubled 
in size in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Those T-shirts weren't just fashion statements. The players rallied around the 
idea, believing that hard work could put a team led by Bob Corkum and Terry 
Yake on par with a team led by Wayne Gretzky and Luc Robitaille. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ron Wilson and his staff dug in, too, ignoring at least one newspaper 
poll that considered the Ducks the least talented team in the league and 
fashioning a successful, if not especially scintillating, dump-and-chase, 
bump-and-grind style of play. 
</P>
<P>
 The players, the coaches, even the fans have overachieved. The string of 
sellouts at Anaheim Arena has been no less remarkable than the Ducks' 
home-and-home sweep of the New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it is up to management to hold up its end. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stephan Lebeau trade was one step in the right direction. Signing Kariya, 
ASAP, would be another. Suddenly, the Ducks' 
two-goals-and-a-cloud-of-ice-shavings offense would be toting a former 30-goal 
scorer, Lebeau, and a rookie playmaker whose puck-handling skills have drawn 
comparisons to Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 While no guarantee of a triumphant ride into the postseason, it certainly 
beats the head-banging prospect of six more weeks of 3-2 defeats. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, however, the Ducks and the Kariya are off in their separate 
corners, undecided. The Ducks, who made a second contract offer to Kariya on 
Tuesday, aren't sure they want to spend more than $1 million a year on a player 
who was drafted behind Tampa Bay's Chris Gratton, who signed for $862,500 per 
season. Kariya, meanwhile, isn't sure he wants to join the Ducks now or return 
to the University of Maine and go for back-to-back NCAA titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent circumstances, however, could push both sides to an accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Maine, charged with using an ineligible player, stands to forfeit 11 victories 
and two ties, which would drop its overall record to 2-30 and make any return 
by Kariya pointless. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings, expected to blow away the Ducks and the Sharks any day now, still 
continue to blow tires three nights a week. The race has come to the Ducks and 
if they know their 1993 baseball history, they know what happened to another 
unexpected contender from Anaheim that failed to make the necessary mid-course 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 If Kariya is the player the Ducks maintain he is -- "franchise player," "one 
of a kind" -- then he is a player worth bending the salary structure for, 
especially now, with the Ducks so close to making a memorable first season 
unforgettable. 
</P>
<P>
 Pull back now, with the Ducks still Skating For Eight and Wilson just asking 
for a fighting chance, and the Ducks risk sacrificing many of the gains they 
have made this season. Just like that, they slip from Something Truly Exciting 
And New to just another denizen in the land of broken promises.

USEFUL LESSONS FOR ATLANTA '96 AND NAGANO '98 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Olympic organizing committees for Atlanta and Nagano, Japan, had offices 
in the basement of the main press center here, but both projects are off the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives for the 1996 Atlanta Summer Games and the 1998 Nagano Winter Games 
said they are on schedule and budget. 
</P>
<P>
 They also said they have profited from the trip to Norway, having learned more 
than the 101 ways to prepare salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 The standout impression in both cases seemed to be the enthusiasm and fairness 
of Norwegian fans and the efficiency and cordiality of the volunteers. Call it 
Southern hospitality in the frozen North. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Payne, president and CEO of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, 
said it underscores the direction he hopes to take in '96, the impression he 
hopes to leave with athletes, officials and fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good about what I've seen here because it tells me we're on the right 
course," he said. "I mean, we spent years trying to determine what should be 
the distinguishing aspect of our Games before realizing it's the natural 
friendliness of people in the South. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Norwegians have set a high standard in that area. No reservoir of details 
can replace a smile. We've seen how powerful the message is when people are as 
passionately behind a project as these people are. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, there's going to be a considerable difference in size, scope and 
scale. We're talking about managing an event that will be six or seven times 
larger than these Games and doing that in a metropolitan area that has as many 
people as this entire country. They have 12,000 volunteers here and we'll have 
more than 60,000. It's impossible to duplicate precisely." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lillehammer budget was a government-subsidized $1 billion. The Atlanta 
budget is $1.4 billion. An estimated $100-million surplus is now being called a 
$60-million contingency fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not because we missed the numbers," Payne said. "It's because we've 
learned more as we've gone along and the program has expanded to include beach 
volleyball, women's softball and four satellite soccer locations (Miami, 
Birmingham, Washington and Orlando, Fla.). We're a little ahead of schedule, 
construction-wise, but we intentionally chose to build later than sooner at 
some of the venues because we don't want to pay for two years of staffing at 
$17 million or so. Everything will be done by the fall of '95. We're scheduled 
for 31 test events. There may be more." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it will be difficult for any future Olympic host to duplicate the 
compact nature of the six principal Lillehammer venues, the Atlanta Games will 
have 17 or 18 sports, plus the Olympic village, within a 1 3/4-mile radius 
known as the Olympic ring in the traffic-diverted downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be more compact than any recent Summer Games other than Munich," 
Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $762-million Nagano Games will also strive for compactness, according to 
press liaison Akio Yoshida, but he is candid about some problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Norway is very ideal," he said. "There are 22,000 people in Lillehammer and 
350,000 in Nagano City. The entire concept will be quite different for us in 
terms of traffic and (the disruption of) ordinary life for our residents. We 
can't be sure how that will work out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also are prevented from using spiked tires in the city. We have to put 
chains on outside the city (where most of the venues are). That takes time and 
is a real headache for us. We are still hoping to resolve that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nagano Games will emphasize peace and children, and Yoshida said he, too, 
has been impressed by the competency of the volunteers and the fairness of the 
Norwegian people "who support athletes by name and understand the value of 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
 "The most impressive thing has been the joy of the people," he said. 
"Unfortunately, the Summer Games are very popular in Japan, but my concern is 
how to create more enthusiasm for the Winter Games." 
</P>
<P>
 Japan had the Winter Games once before, in Sapporo in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoshida said he was confident that by 1998, through promotions with the 
Japanese athletes who have done well here, there will be renewed interest and a 
spirit to match Norway's. 
</P>
<P>
 Payne said that putting the Winter Games on a different four-year cycle, 
benefits Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Winter Games always deflected some attention from the Summer Games," he 
said. "The level of interest in our games should escalate quicker than it did 
between Albertville and Barcelona (in '94), and that's wonderful. The more 
interest the better."

N.Y. TUNES IN TO A CURRENT DESPAIR; WITH THE TABLOIDS AT THEIR HEELS, RILEY AND 
THE KNICKS TRY TO SHAKE A SLUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Animal That Has to Be Fed Every Single Day, which is what Pat Riley calls 
the media, has dialed room service. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley's Knicks have fallen to No. 3 in the NBA East. They are averaging 86 
points since the All-Star break and in a recent loss shot 29%. In Sunday's 
92-78 loss to the Suns, Charles Smith messed up a dunk with his team trailing, 
73-69, by traveling on a two-on-none fast break. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happened to Smith? 
</P>
<P>
 He left the Clippers with an 18-point career average but in New York is best 
known for messing up in the clutch, like last spring's Eastern finals when 
three different Bulls blocked four of his layups in the closing seconds of a 
one-point game. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith never runs away, never makes excuses, but it's tough to be a 
disappointment on the team in a tabloid town. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we win," he said in the thick gloom of the Knick locker room, "we're on 
top. When we lose, we're on the bottom. There's no in-between."  
</P>
<P>
 Riley, a master at the care and feeding of the fourth estate, has all he can 
handle. Two of New York's three tabloid newspapers, the Post and Daily News, 
have faced extinction in his 2 1/2 seasons, leading to a go-for-it style of 
sports journalism unknown elsewhere in America. 
</P>
<P>
 When two unidentified Knicks criticized Riley's reliance on Patrick Ewing this 
season, the Daily News gave it the big treatment, a back-page headline that 
read: "TEAM TURMOIL," in letters 2 1/4 inches high. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley called a team meeting the next day and, according to the Post's Peter 
Vecsey, asked every player one by one if they had been the source. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to miss out on all the fun, the Post ran a headline that read: "KNICKS: 
WE'LL FIND LOCKER ROOM RAT." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Knicks' slogan was, "Tough Team, Tough Town." 
</P>
<P>
 Underneath, it should have said: "May the best man win." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 . . . Those headlines are about unexpected losses and players who finally 
believe their coach makes mistakes. . . . The emperor has no Armani tie. Riley 
can be wrong, finally, in his third season in New York. The arrow no longer 
points up all the time."  
</P>
<P>
 -- FILIP BONDY, 
</P>
<P>
 New York Daily News 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 26, 1994 
</P>
<P>
 For all its sophistication, New York is like any burg, dying to worship at a 
winner's feet, differing only in the toll it collects if disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley tip-toed a high wire with Knick leftovers in his first season, blowing 
first place in the Atlantic Division to the Celtics before rallying his players 
for a postseason run that ended in a dramatic seven-game loss to the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, Gotham was his. In Los Angeles, he was a star amid stars. In New 
York, with the publicity-shy Ewing and a cast of role players, Riley became the 
star. 
</P>
<P>
 He became more than that, transcendent. He was profiled by Vanity Fair, which 
sent Daily News political writer Ken Auletta, and by Esquire, which sent 
Pulitzer Prize winner David Halberstam and ran the piece in a series between 
stories on architect I.M. Pei and actor Al Pacino. NBC sent Tom Brokaw for a 
one-on-one interview; PBS' Charlie Rose did an hour with him; Jay Leno had him 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks won 60 games last season and home-court advantage through the East 
finals butwere upended by the Bulls anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 But as they were despairing of getting around Michael Jordan, he retired. The 
Knicks claimed this changed nothing because their goal already was staked out, 
but on WFAN, deejay Don Imus gave his version of Riley's reaction: 
</P>
<P>
 "YESSSSS!" 
</P>
<P>
 Riley opened camp in Charleston, S.C., at 12:01 a.m. while the rest of the NBA 
slept, vowing to field the first team on the floor this season and the last 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks started 7-0, as expected, then slumped, a surprise. Since Riley's 
arrival, they've been bears on defense but have struggled to reach 100 points. 
In their heyday, the 1992 playoffs, Xavier McDaniel averaged 19, but McDaniel 
fled when Smith was acquired and it's been a struggle since. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time Riley looked up this season, a new losing streak was breaking out. 
If his players thought he was making mistakes, they kept it to themselves and 
fought back. 
</P>
<P>
 They won six in a row after the TEAM TURMOIL crisis, slumped at the All-Star 
break, then rallied to hold the Bulls to 68 points on national TV. When it 
looked as though Riley had put Humpty Dumpty back together, they shot 29% in 
losing to the SuperSonics in Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Said an exasperated Riley: "We win a sorry game on national television and 
everyone says, 'The Knicks are back.' . . . We think championship thoughts and 
we're nowhere even close to that." He yelled at his players during practice the 
next day, loud enough to be heard outside the closed gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenged anew at an inopportune moment in the schedule, the Knicks went on 
the road and lost at Houston and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the Nuggets, John Starks threw a no-look pass into press row and Riley 
yanked him 1:24 into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time it's happened in 2 1/2 years," Riley said a day later 
in Phoenix. "This is the first experience they've had with not being able to 
pull themselves up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always been a team that came back. We have lost a little of our heart, 
and there's a big difference between that and quitting. You don't quit, but we 
lose a little bit of heart when you can't make open shots. You go three for 32 
over a period of time, you're going to lose a little heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the Knicks, only Ewing is dependable. Starks is explosive but erratic. 
Reserve guard Hubert Davis is consistent. The others are adventures. Greg 
Anthony and Anthony Bonner can shoot whenever they wish as opponents back off, 
zeroing in on the inside game and inviting the Knicks to take still more 
perimeter shots. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the gang that couldn't shoot straight came in at 37% and rang up 
loss No. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley believes that suffering builds character. No one takes it as hard as he 
does, as his players are obliged to do. They win because losing is not merely 
unpleasant but intolerable, as long as they hold up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've been about as patient as I can be," Riley said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I really care about this team, especially the five or six guys 
who've been with us for 2 1/2 years, and I've always had a history of staying 
with guys going up and going down. But I think somewhere in the best interests 
of the team, you're going to probably have to do something, just to get a 
different mix. Guys will have to look at it, not as a penalty but as just 
trying to change a few things to get more energy out there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever it's going to take, we'll do that. I don't think we're going to have 
any conflicts because the truth is out there, out on the court, and it's not 
very good right now."

DELINO DESHIELDS IS; TAKING A NEW TACK; DODGERS CAN EXPECT ALMOST ANYTHING FROM 
THEIR SECOND BASEMAN, WHO NOW WOULD LIKE TO BE KNOWN FOR WHAT HE DOES ON THE 
FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He was born in a town with a population of about 5,000, to a mother who was 15 
and a father who was 18. They never married. 
</P>
<P>
 His grandmother, Elizabeth, raised him. They had food on the table and clothes 
on their backs. They had love, they just didn't have any money. 
</P>
<P>
 He respected his father, Wilson, but his father was never there for him. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Debbie, tried to be there for him, but that didn't always work 
out, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had me when they were young," DeShields explained, "and they had a lot 
of living to do. I tell them that we can't really make up for lost time, we 
just have to go on from here and make the most of it." 
</P>
<P>
 When DeShields was in junior high school, he watched his mother fall into the 
snare of alcoholism. That, Debbie now says, forced her son to grow up quickly, 
far sooner than any 12-year-old should be expected to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a problem with alcohol, and Delino had a lot of decisions to make at a 
young age," she said, adding that she has not had a drink in four years. "My 
alcoholism made him grow up. My not being there for him made him dig deeper 
within himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wish you could change things in the past, but some things you can't. In 
the last four years, we have started a whole new relationship and we are very 
close. Delino is always saying to me, 'I had a hard time raising you, Mom.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As DeShields grew older, he finally had a choice, or so it seemed. He was the 
second black quarterback at Seaford High, in Seaford, Del. -- the first was his 
uncle -- and he also starred in baseball and basketball. The only sport he 
couldn't handle was wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
 From an early age, though, DeShields knew what sport he wanted to play. Even 
when a basketball was bigger than him, his mother said, he handled it with 
skill. 
</P>
<P>
 He became so good, in fact, that Rollie 
</P>
<P>
 Massimino at Villanova offered him the only freshman basketball scholarship 
</P>
<P>
 available for the 1987 season, and he accepted. His future, it seemed, was 
set. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Montreal Expos also selected DeShields, a shortstop, in the first 
round of the 1987 draft, and with that came a bonus of $140,000 -- a pittance 
to most players now but a lot of money then. 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields loved basketball, but his grandmother lost her house around that 
time because of financial difficulties and, as agonizing as the decision was to 
make, there really was little question what DeShields would do. He signed with 
the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, he was told that he could do both -- fulfill his college obligation 
and play baseball, " Debbie said. "But then Montreal didn't allow him to play 
basketball. He never complained, but he really loved basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it is still with him a little bit today." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He has a different look, Delino DeShields does, and he's not afraid to display 
it -- wearing his socks to his knees and his pants baggy out of deference to 
the old Negro Leagues, writing things in his glove, doing stuff with his hair 
and choking up high on the bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes he'll talk, sometimes he won't. Sometimes he'll just stare at you 
and not say a word. 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields isn't sure why he's done some of the things he has, but said he 
feels more mature now. At 25, he's beginning his fifth major league season, 
this one with the Dodgers. The Nehru hat and the blue high-tops are long gone. 
So is the shaved head. And the socks are down, too -- for now, anyway. Besides 
cutting off his circulation at times, he found that his socks prompted more 
questions than his game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good person, but a lot of people are not going to understand him, 
because he's kind of weird," said Marquis Grissom, DeShields' best friend and 
former teammate at Montreal. "He talks when he wants to talk, and when he does 
talk, he's honest. He's not going to hold anything back. He's not too outspoken 
about things off the field; he'll stick to the topic of baseball most of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just have to give him his space, players especially, because he's 
stubborn in some ways, but they're good ways. When he sets his mind out to do 
something -- he has accomplished so much so fast -- it's like he's not afraid 
and he teaches himself, because he gets tired of making the same mistake over 
and over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Grissom and DeShields came up in Montreal's system, steering similar courses 
through the minors. So when DeShields was told by the Expos in November that 
he'd been traded to the Dodgers for Pedro Martinez, Grissom was one of the 
first he called. "I told him I didn't believe it, that I would have to watch it 
on ESPN," Grissom said, "and I think he was stunned." 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields spent only three years in the minors before arriving in Montreal for 
the 1990 season. He was a shortstop, but the Expos wanted to get him into a 
lineup that already featured Spike Owen. Interestingly, it was then-Dodger 
minor league manager Timmy Johnson, now a coach with the Expos, who helped 
DeShields make the conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was managing a team in Mexico in the winter league when the Expos asked me 
if I would work Delino out at second base," Johnson said. "He's such a great 
athlete, one of the best I've ever seen, and when he went to second base, we 
won everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy does everything. He's a leader on the ballclub, a quiet leader, but 
when he says something, you listen. He is one guy who doesn't use a crutch for 
anything, and never has. And on the field, he can make anything happen. Want to 
get a big base? He steals that. Want to make a big play? He does that. Need a 
big run? There isn't anybody else you want at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Delino at second base, he's going to make Jose Offerman a better 
shortstop and Eric Karros a better first baseman. This guy is going to get 
balls that Karros won't have to worry about. This is an exciting player." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president, found DeShields so enticing that 
he gave up perhaps the best pitcher on his team. Just about every club wanted 
Martinez, but Claire, after retreating from the Jody Reed negotiations when his 
offer of $8 million for three years was rejected, only budged for DeShields. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reed is a fiery player and a leader in the clubhouse, but I think people are 
going to be surprised at what Delino will do," said Tim Wallach, a teammate of 
DeShields in his first three Expo seasons. "People think he's quiet, but he's 
such a competitor and he's so tough, he wants to win. He's a very mature guy 
for his age and he's gotten better every season." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first things Claire did was sign DeShields to a $2.7-million 
contract for this season, giving him a raise of more than $1.1 million. "He 
fits with our club so well because of his great athletic ability, his attitude 
and presence on and off the field, and because of his youth, " Claire said. 
"With how we are building with youth, I can't think of anyone at his position 
who could fit our club better than Delino." 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields has averaged 46 stolen bases, 144 hits and 77 runs scored in his 
four major league seasons. Last season, he had an 81% success rate in stolen 
bases. He has a career .277 batting average -- .293 over the past two seasons. 
In fielding percentage, he finished sixth in the National League last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only tough thing about the trade is leaving the guys I came up with," 
DeShields said. "I felt like I could talk to everybody and everybody could talk 
to me. Guys would come to me with their problems, but we were all young guys 
anyway on the Expos, so we all related to each other pretty well. . . . Dennis 
Martinez was the oldest guy on the team, by far. Whereas on the Dodgers, you 
have a better mix. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Expos gave me a chance to do what I had to do and I'm thankful for that. 
Now it's time to move on." 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields comes to the Dodgers with high expectations, most of them his own. 
This may be his fifth season, but he is aware that he is talked about as though 
he had been playing for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Expectations have been there all my life, basically, but if other people 
don't put high expectations up for me, I seem to do it myself," he said. "I 
think I'm maturing now. When I first came to the league, I was young and I 
didn't know a specific way to act, so I was just being myself. Like sometimes I 
would write "love" on one glove and "hate" on another, things that I don't 
really know why I did. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I feel a little more secure about what I'm doing now. I want to be known 
for what I do on the field, not for what I wear or how I look." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the field, DeShields is serious. Grissom said he doesn't joke around, 
doesn't smile much and sometimes works too hard. But off the field, he and 
Grissom spent a lot of time talking, playing pool . . . and sometimes playing a 
little basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I could play basketball but he can really play, he's NBA material," 
Grissom said. "He can get down." 
</P>
<P>
 The other day in batting practice, Manager Tom Lasorda yelled out to 
DeShields: "Hey, Delino, I talked with Rollie (Massimino) the other day, and he 
told me to tell you hi. He really wanted you to play for him, boy did he." 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields still loves basketball, although when Claire asked him recently if 
he could dunk, DeShields said he didn't have any plans to play, even for fun -- 
which suits Claire just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although I don't think there are any restrictions in his contract, I can say 
that I hope Delino's basketball days are behind him," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
 Had he played basketball for a year and then quit, DeShields thinks he would 
have regretted it. "But there are no regrets now," he said, "everything is 
lovely." 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields married Tisha Milligan about three years ago, and they have an 
18-month-old son, Delino Jr. DeShields has found that being a father has given 
him a deeper understanding of the perils of being a parent, and he often speaks 
to groups of children about the perils of being a child. He never really had 
anyone do that for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't preach to them but sometimes I'm there just so they can see me," said 
DeShields, who remains in close contact with his father. "I was talking to some 
kids yesterday and I told them that they can't be afraid to try different 
things. I asked them, 'What would you rather do -- struggle and stay in that 
one spot, or change and have some success?' That's my way of looking at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Seaford, DeShields' mother turned 41 last Saturday. She has gone back 
to school and recently earned her Associate of Arts degree. She plans to go on 
for a bachelor's degree in human resources. On her birthday, she talked about 
the past, hesitantly but honestly. 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields remembered what effect it had on his mother the first time he told 
the story of his upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came up to the big leagues and told my story, it was very 
difficult for her," he said. "But she is getting stronger now, and it's getting 
better. She told me she talked about it again and she still feels 
uncomfortable. But I told her that all of that is in the past, it's OK now. We 
are moving forward."

THEY ARE INSPIRED BY QUAKE; L.A. MARATHON: DESPITE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY JAN. 17 
TEMBLOR, FOUR SAY THEY WILL GIVE IT THEIR BEST ON SUNDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The four were pounding toward a single vision when the dark rumblings of Jan. 
17 nearly stole everything. 
</P>
<P>
 It took their walls. Their furniture. Their memories. Their composure. 
</P>
<P>
 But upon sifting through the rubble, they each realized the Northridge 
earthquake had left something behind: 
</P>
<P>
 Their running shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday morning, Dave Callahan is going to fulfill an annual pledge to run in 
the Los Angeles Marathon even though he has not run anywhere since the morning 
of Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 That is when he sprinted from the window of his Northridge apartment and 
directly onto a parking lot that used to be 15 feet below. 
</P>
<P>
 Les Spitza is going to keep his promise by walking in the marathon with 
disabled friends, even though the only place he has walked recently is to the 
refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 Stress eating, he said. Fifteen added pounds in six weeks, he figures. 
Something about compensating for the discomfort of spending 10 days in his 
front yard in a tent. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Jett told herself last summer she would run in the marathon, and so she 
will. But she said friends waiting for her at the finish line will be carrying 
a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are some of the same friends who have helped her endure life in a 
tarpaulin-covered house, where the earthquake was followed by a flood. 
</P>
<P>
 Juanesta Holmes vowed to run her first marathon when she turned 30, and she's 
been 30 for five months, so she's not quitting, either. 
</P>
<P>
 She simply never dreamed she would be running without a home address or phone 
or any trace of the calmness required to complete 26.2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Their friends say they are foolish. Their sensibilities tell them to think 
about it. Their bodies cry for more time. 
</P>
<P>
 But these four, like dozens of others from earthquake-ravaged areas, will line 
up at the Coliseum Sunday morning to complete what they have started. 
</P>
<P>
 For them, a race which once was frivolity has become necessity. They need the 
Los Angeles Marathon to convince them of what nobody else can. 
</P>
<P>
 That life goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if they had considered dropping out, their answers were polite, but 
short. Typical was the response of Callahan. He needed three words: 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no, no." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To understand the dozens who will run in the ninth annual marathon despite 
suffering tremendous losses in the recent disaster, it helps to understand 
those who will not run.  
</P>
<P>
 Randy Green is a 40-year-old real estate executive. He owns his own company. 
He has run in four previous marathons, including Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 He is disciplined enough to awaken at 4 a.m. every day to train. He had paid 
his $25 entry fee. His runner's bib was in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Then one morning two weeks after the quake, running at 4:30 a.m., at a dark 
corner near his Northridge home, he stopped. "I said, 'I'm done,' " Green 
recalled. "I decided, no marathon this year." 
</P>
<P>
 He was exhausted from trying to sleep with the television set blaring. After 
the quake, his frightened wife would not sleep any other way. 
</P>
<P>
 He was exhausted from living for 10 days without running water. 
</P>
<P>
 He was sluggish from gaining 10 pounds after eating boxes of the only thing 
that tasted good while their refrigerator was inoperable -- dinosaur cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 He was exhausted from handling more than $50 million in escrowed real estate 
that had been affected in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I couldn't do my best, and I know I couldn't, then I didn't want to run at 
all," Green said. "Other people can do that, but not me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If a model runner like Green drops out, what chance does a 37-year-old rookie 
like Sandy Jett have?  
</P>
<P>
 Her entire running resume consists of one 5K, and she's already decided she 
will have to walk part of the marathon course. 
</P>
<P>
 She recently saw a marathon commercial on television and said nervously, "Oh, 
God." 
</P>
<P>
 But faced with an impending divorce last summer, she decided she could only 
handle the stress by running through it. And those runs, she vowed then, would 
culminate Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody thinks I'm crazy, they all say I'm never going to make it," Jett 
said. "But if I have to crawl, I'm making it. If it takes me two days, I'm 
making it." 
</P>
<P>
 For those such as Green, and there are several, marathon organizers have 
agreed to refund their entry fee and grant them free entry into the race-day 
5K. 
</P>
<P>
 For those such as Jett, psychologists say their reward will come after the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a natural disaster, you lose control of so many things," said Dr. Eric 
Denson, sports psychologist at the University of Delaware. "By sticking with a 
marathon, these people are proving to themselves that they still have control 
over something. This feeling is very important." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Callahan, a dialysis technician, thinks about control every time he 
climbs into his rented Chevrolet. 
</P>
<P>
 His own car, a 1987 royal blue Camaro he treated like a child, remains crushed 
under the rubble of his apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that he lived across the parking lot from the deadly Northridge 
Meadows apartment complex, he considers himself lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 But considering that he stopped all training for a month after the earthquake 
while searching for a place to live, and now runs only two to three miles a 
day, he knows there are more aches in his future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The marathon is going to be painful for me," Callahan said. "About halfway 
through the race, I'm really going to start hurting. This is going to take me 
more than six hours, I am sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Callahan, 35, might have made the decision to remain in the marathon while 
riding his bike through damaged Northridge streets on the morning of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 He came upon a section of a street that had cracked and burst into flames. 
Sitting on that crack was the burned-out shell of a car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought to myself, 'Man, I'm alive,' " Callahan said. "And now I'm going to 
live out my commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Les Spitza's commitment was to more than just himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Spitza, 47, a supervisor at the Crippled Children's Society, was cheering 
runners at Mile 3 last year when a retarded, deaf friend approached. "He said 
he wanted to walk next year, and I said, 'Fine, I'll walk with you,' " Spitza 
recalled. "People heard about it, and pretty soon, 13 or 14 individuals signed 
up to go with me." 
</P>
<P>
 What they may not have heard is that their leader is still recovering from the 
memories of kicking down a door and rescuing his daughter on the morning of the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-7, 230-pound Spitza is also recovering from late-night meals 
following aftershocks. "For a long time, after every night tremor, I couldn't 
sleep," he said. "I would get up and go into the kitchen for something to eat. 
I was thinking like, that may be my last meal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admit, I have thought about calling it off," said Spitza, his voice rising. 
"But I don't want to disappoint all these people. I just will not let this 
earthquake keep interfering with my life."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Juanesta Holmes knew her life had been disrupted the moment she looked up from 
behind her bed in Northridge on the morning of Jan. 17. Instead of a bedroom 
wall, she saw a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes had planned to get up in an hour and drive to Venice Beach for her 
usual run. She didn't make that drive for another 12 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Running is a mental game, and with all that was happening, I just couldn't 
bring myself to go out there," she said. "I was just a nervous wreck." 
</P>
<P>
 She is still living in three places. The only way to reach her is via 
electronic voice mail. There are times she still doesn't want to be alone. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she will have plenty of company Sunday. Not merely from the thousands of 
runners and spectators, but also the hopes of thousands of earthquake victims 
still searching for ways to cope. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm done with this, I'm still not going to have a place to live," she 
said, pausing. "But I will have accomplished something." 
</P>
<P>
 The tone in her voice made it clear which she considered more important.

CLIPPERS TO PLAY SEVEN GAMES AT ANAHEIM ARENA NEXT SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clippers announced Tuesday they will play seven games in Anaheim Arena 
next season. But they once again said they have no interest in moving there 
permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe Los Angeles is where we should look to build our new arena," said 
Andy Roeser, Clipper executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Roeser said the Clippers will play the Lakers in an exhibition game Oct. 18. 
The dates of six regular-season games, most likely against Western Conference 
opponents, will be announced in July, when the NBA schedule is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers this season signed a three-year contract extension with the 
Sports Arena, their home for 10 seasons since moving to Los Angeles from San 
Diego. But playing twice in Anaheim Arena this season -- an October exhibition 
game and a regular-season game against the New York Knicks -- only heightened 
the Clippers' interest in a sparkling new arena of their own, Roeser said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I look at (Anaheim Arena), I'm focused more sharply on how 
wonderful it would be to have a state-of-the-art arena in Los Angeles," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 He said the Clippers' desire to play a portion of their home schedule in 
Anaheim is rooted in a need to further expand their fan base into Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're more interested in expanding our fan base rather than substituting it 
for another," he said. "The concept of playing a portion of our games in Orange 
County was an idea I'd been thinking of for some time. We were pleased with the 
enthusiasm we received in October as well as the Knick game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected to go down there and have an enthusiastic response. It confirmed 
what we already knew to be true." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers drew 17,507, a club record, to their Jan. 27 game against the 
Knicks at Anaheim Arena. They played once at the Forum and once in Anaheim 
while the Sports Arena's earthquake damage was being repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we would like to hear that the Clippers would like to relocate in 
Orange County," said Brad Mayne, Anaheim Arena general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased to offer the NBA to Orange County for seven games. Obviously, 
these games can only help us in promoting how well the building will work with 
the NBA, how many fans we can hold and how professionally we can handle the 
NBA."

BOXER SUFFERS SERIOUS INJURY AT THE FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Boxer Miguel Mercedes was in serious condition late Tuesday night after a vein 
burst in his skull after a bout at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercedes was taken to Westside Hospital and later moved to Cedars Sinai, where 
a neurosurgeon was scheduled to meet with ringside physician Robert Karns and 
decide if surgery was needed immediately.Karns said that Mercedes did have 
swelling but that he was conscious. 
</P>
<P>
 After referee Jim Jen Kin stopped the fight at 45 seconds of the 10th and 
final round, with Mercedes trapped against the ropes by super-flyweight Cecilio 
Espino, Mercedes walked back to his corner and then lost consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 He quickly regained his senses, and was speaking to attendants about 10 
minutes after the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 28, 1989, in Mexico, Hector Ruiz died of head injuries suffered in a 
fight against Espino.

KERRIGAN DEFENDS IMAGE AFTER FIELDING CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A week ago, Nancy Kerrigan could do little wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 She had overcome one of sport's most bizarre incidents -- the Jan. 6 clubbing 
of her knee -- to win a silver medal in women's figure skating at the XVII 
Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, she was responding to criticism of her actions since winning the 
medal Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan's ice-smooth image suffered some cracks almost minutes after Oksana 
Baiul of Ukraine edged her for the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 When she was told -- mistakenly -- that the medal ceremony had been delayed 
because Baiul was redoing her makeup, an annoyed Kerrigan was heard on 
television saying: "Oh, come on. So she's going to get out here and cry again. 
What's the difference?" 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan said her remarks were not meant to slight Baiul, 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been through an Olympic medal ceremony before, and they are always very 
emotional," she said in a statement. "Everyone cries. I was afraid the crowd 
was losing its enthusiasm and was starting to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan left Norway before the closing ceremony to attend a parade at Disney 
World in Orlando, Fla., although Disney officials said the parade could have 
been held another day. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, a TV report showed a videotape of Kerrigan, sitting in a Disney World 
parade next to a Mickey Mouse character, saying: "This is so corny, this is so 
dumb. I hate it. This is the most corny thing I've ever done." 
</P>
<P>
 Responded Kerrigan: "I was not saying that the parade was corny or dumb. I 
enjoyed it tremendously. Riding down Main Street with Mickey Mouse -- what 
could be better than that? 
</P>
<P>
 "What I was commenting on to my mother was her insistence that I wear my medal 
during the parade. Since I was a little girl, I was told not to brag. I was 
afraid it might look like bragging and I'm not comfortable with that."

RAMS TAKE A PASS ON MITCHELL -- FOR NOW; PRO FOOTBALL: FREE-AGENT QUARTERBACK 
LEAVES ANAHEIM WITHOUT AN OFFER. VIKINGS HAVE BID $9.5 MILLION FOR THREE YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Scott Mitchell made the visit Tuesday, but the Rams didn't make the contract 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 At least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 A day after the Minnesota Vikings offered him a three-year contract worth $9.5 
million, Mitchell, a free-agent quarterback from the Miami Dolphins, came up 
empty-handed in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram Senior Vice President Jay Zygmunt met with Tony Agnone, Mitchell's agent, 
Monday night and part of Tuesday, but the team held off on an offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest thing is the timing," Zygmunt said. "We (he and Agnone) will talk 
later in the week. We're very interested in them, and they're very interested 
in us." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, the Rams' top free-agent prospect, met with team officials and 
toured the Anaheim practice facility Tuesday. He said he plans to wait until 
making all his visits before signing with one of his four finalists: Detroit, 
Minnesota, New Orleans and the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 He visited Detroit and Minnesota last week, canceled a visit to Washington and 
will be in New Orleans today. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said he will make a decision "as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota's offer is a huge boost from Mitchell's salary last season with the 
Dolphins -- $369,000 with another $150,000 in incentive bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money is all just a byproduct of how you perform on the field," Mitchell 
said. "As a quarterback, it's important to have good people around you. You can 
be the greatest physical specimen that ever walked the face of the earth, and 
if you don't have good people around you, you're not going to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it gets right down to it, if someone offers me the most money, I'm not 
going to say that's where I'm going unless it fits everything else I want. 
Money is not going to be the determining factor." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why not all of Mitchell's inquiries with the Rams involved dollar 
signs. He also was curious about the team's future, commitment to winning and 
its possible move to another city. 
</P>
<P>
 He asked those questions as he toured the practice facility with assistant 
head coach Joe Vitt and new offensive coordinator Chick Harris, met with 
linebacker Roman Phifer and had lunch with Coach Chuck Knox. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear all the time about Ground Chuck, and they have (tailback) Jerome 
Bettis here," Mitchell said. "Are they going to run the ball all the time? What 
is their commitment to a quarterback? 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to know what they're going to do to turn it around. They haven't won 
a lot of games in the last couple of years. I just want to know what they think 
they need to do to get to the playoffs and win." 
</P>
<P>
 With quarterback Jim Everett on the trading block, the Rams courted Mitchell 
and have made a pitch for Houston's Warren Moon, but the Oilers don't seem 
ready to trade him. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta quarterback Chris Miller, an unrestricted free agent, will visit on 
Thursday, and unrestricted free agents Bubby Brister of Philadelphia and Chris 
Chandler of Phoenix are scheduled to visit next week, Zygmunt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are attracted to Mitchell because of his age (26) and size (6 feet 6 
and 230 pounds). If they sign Mitchell, a left-hander, the Rams probably will 
have to bring in a right tackle to protect his blindside. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell was 3-4 as a starter last season in place of an injured Dan Marino. 
And he missed a month after suffering a separated left shoulder when he was hit 
by Philadelphia's Seth Joyner. But Mitchell returned and played well in the 
final two games of the season, both Miami losses. 
</P>
<P>
 In his pro career, Mitchell has completed 135 of 241 passes for 1,805 yards 
with 12 touchdowns and nine interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said he became frustrated in Miami as a backup to Marino and holder 
for kicks the past four seasons. In 1992, he led the Orlando Thunder to an 8-2 
record and the World League finals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mitchell got his break in the NFL's new era of free agency, which allows 
him to be courted by several teams.  
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a blessing to some degree and it's also been frustrating," he 
said. "The way the system used to be, I would be a guy like Jeff Hostetler, 
spend several years in New York, and be stuck there. Some guys might say, 
'That's not so bad, being a backup.' But that's never been my style or 
approach. I've always wanted to make the most of it and take it as far as I 
could."

 Wayne Sevier, the Rams' top candidate for the special teams coaching vacancy, 
was one of four Washington Redskin assistant coaches dismissed Tuesday by new 
Coach Norv Turner.

<P>
 Dallas defensive tackle Jimmie Jones arrived Tuesday night and will visit Rams 
Park today. Giant offensive tackle Doug Riesenberg, 6-5 and 275 pounds, will 
visit on Thursday along with Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram wide receiver Henry Ellard, an unrestricted free agent, visited Denver on 
Tuesday. Tight end Pat Carter, also an unrestricted free agent, is planning to 
visit the Houston Oilers later this week.

DELAITRE'S EARLY DEFAULT CREATES CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The early default of Frenchman Olivier Delaitre in the Newsweek Champions Cup 
brought some early controversy to the tournament Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Delaitre, trailing 4-1 in the first set of his match against Australian Darren 
Cahill, had to be helped off the court and put in a back brace before he was 
able to leave the premises. He had injured his back Sunday, during the final of 
a challenger's tournament at La Quinta in which he retired. As a finalist, he 
received one of the wild-card spots into the main draw of the Champions Cup, 
and was cleared to play Tuesday after being examined by a doctor from the ATP 
Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, some players -- especially those who had a shot at the spot in 
the main draw taken by Delaitre -- were angry that he was allowed to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Tarango, the former Stanford star from Manhattan Beach, was the No. 1 
"lucky loser," or the first player to get into the main draw if somebody else 
withdrew. So Tarango was among the most vocal on the Delaitre situation 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He should have been fined by the ATP for unprofessional conduct," Tarango 
said. "What happens is, he goes out there, takes up a spot, picks up the prize 
money for a first-round loser ($5,175) and also gets a $325-a-night hotel room 
paid for the rest of the week because he is in the main draw. That's not right. 
It was obvious he couldn't play. I don't think he got a point in the last three 
games." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Fred Viancos, manager of the ATP Tour, Delaitre will not be 
fined. 
</P>
<P>
 "The procedure is that if a player withdraws with an injury, he has to be 
checked by our doctor before he plays in the next event, and that was done with 
Delaitre Tuesday morning," Viancos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Viancos also said that even if Delaitre had been forced to withdraw because of 
his injury before playing his match, his hotel cost would have been taken care 
of, in accordance with ATP rules. 
</P>
<P>
 All wild-card entries into the main draw, except for two, were earned through 
various qualifying tournaments. But Tarango said he thought that tournament 
officials here do not give enough consideration to Southern California players 
such as himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Pasarell, tournament director, who gave his two wild cards this year 
to Mats Wilander and Jim Grabb, said: "I don't play that way. I try to give 
this tournament as much of an international flavor as I can." BILL DWYRE

NCAA REJECTS CLU'S APPEAL TO MOVE PLAYOFF SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The NCAA Division III basketball playoff committee has turned down Cal 
Lutheran's appeal to change the site for Saturday night's second-round game 
between the Kingsmen and the winner of Thursday night's Pomona-Pitzer-UC San 
Diego contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran Coach Mike Dunlap proposed that the game be played at Occidental 
College at 7:30 p.m. after the Division III playoff committee announced that 
the Kingsmen (24-2) would have to play at the home court of the winner of 
Thursday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran, top-seeded team in the West region, was expecting to play host 
to a second-round game after a first-round bye, but the size of its court 
(smaller than the standard 94 x 50 feet) and the limited seating capacity (800) 
at its gymnasium do not meet the NCAA's specifications for a playoff site. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark College was available, but it could be guaranteed only for an 
afternoon game because the Raiders could be playing host to a Southern 
California regional final that night if the Raiders defeat Southwestern 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Division III playoff committee believed it was unfair for the 
Pomona-Pitzer-UC San Diego winner to have to play Saturday afternoon after 
playing Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to get the NCAA to change anything," Dunlap said. "Now we just need 
to get off of this and get on to preparing for Saturday night." JOHN ORTEGA

MIGHTY DUCK NOTES / ROBYN NORWOOD; TUGNUTT WILL TEST HIS NEW MASK TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Tugnutt kissed his wife and baby a week and a half ago and left town with 
the Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 He came home a Montreal Canadien, and tonight, he'll start in goal for the 
Canadiens, just 10 days after he was traded for Stephan Lebeau. 
</P>
<P>
 The custom-made Mighty Duck goalie mask he waited five months for is just 
another souvenir now, and Tugnutt already has a new mask he'll wear tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 He's looking at the game -- his first start for the Canadiens -- as "something 
I'm going to enjoy." And whatever happens, he'll laugh with his buddies on the 
Ducks after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the teams' practices Tuesday, his former teammates gathered around the 
Montreal bench to catch up, but tonight they'll be out to beat him. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I skate by or after the whistle, I'm going to be saying things to him, 
see if I can get him off his game," Duck winger Terry Yake said. "I don't know 
if it will work though, because he'll know I'm joking." 
</P>
<P>
 The day of the trade, Tugnutt might have been the first player in NHL history 
to be disappointed to go from an expansion team to the Canadiens, winner of 24 
Stanley Cups. For him, it meant becoming a full-time backup again, this time 
behind Patrick Roy, perhaps the best goalie in the world. It also meant he 
wasn't sure when he would see his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a lot better now than I did before," Tugnutt said. "Things have 
settled in, and I got a chance to come back and see my wife and baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacob, Ron and Lisa's first child, was born Jan. 23, and the road trip was the 
first time Ron and been away from more than a day or two. It turned out to be 
longer than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a week and a half, but it seemed longer," Tugnutt said. "He gained 
some weight, he got taller. It seemed like he changed a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With 20 games left in their season, the Mighty Ducks are doing what once 
seemed unthinkable: They're preparing to send out ticket order forms for the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the tickets designed and the forms designed," said club President 
Tony Tavares, adding that prices will be announced shortly. 
</P>
<P>
 They would have done it even sooner, but Tavares said the first-year team 
would have been "at the risk of being called presumptuous or unrealistic." 
</P>
<P>
 But with seven weeks left in the regular season, he's calling it pragmatic. 
The Ducks are three points behind San Jose and two ahead of the Kings in the 
battle for the final Western Conference playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were an established team, our package would have been out long before 
now," Tavares said, noting that the Kings' is already out. He also pointed out 
that the first payments won't be due until late March -- meaning fans will have 
a better idea if the Ducks really might make it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, all this is a bonus to us," he said. "We didn't anticipate being 
here. Certainly the playoffs were beyond our dreams."

INELIGIBLE PLAYER GETS CARSON DISQUALIFIED FROM CITY PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hours before it was to take on Dorsey High in the semifinals of the City 
Section boys' basketball playoffs Tuesday night, Carson was disqualified for 
using an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Fiege, City athletic commissioner, said she received an anonymous fax 
Tuesday morning giving detailed information about a Carson player who was 
academically ineligible.Fiege contacted school officials, and they later 
confirmed the information. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Anthony Browder, has been ineligible since grades were issued on Feb. 
7. Coach Richard Masson thought Browder had done makeup work to improve his 
grades, so he let him play in the last six games, including two in the 
playoffs. Masson said he was unaware that grades could not be changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Masson said he is upset at himself for not double-checking the rules, 
he is even more devastated that the fax came from someone at Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda Cleveland, eliminated by Carson in the quarterfinals last Friday, 
replaces the Colts. It plays Dorsey in a rescheduled Division 4-A semifinal 
tonight at Crenshaw High. The winner will face Crenshaw in the championship 
game Friday night at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiege said City rules require that a team eliminated in the playoffs be 
replaced by the team it last defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Browder, a 6-foot-4 forward, is one of Carson's top players. He scored 15 
points in the Colts' first-round playoff game against Venice and added a 
game-high 21 points against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson has to forfeit three games, changing its record to 15-10. ERIC SHEPARD

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; PIAZZA ADJUSTS TO BIGGER FAN DEMANDS

<P>
 With success has come attention, and there is nobody at Dodgertown generating 
more fan interest than catcher Mike Piazza, who is learning to deal with it the 
best he can. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that my job is to play baseball, and above that I try to accommodate 
everybody I can, but it's difficult sometimes," Piazza said Tuesday at Vero 
Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "Undoubtedly people will say that you have changed, but you have to make some 
changes in order to get your job done. I would like to sign autographs for 
everybody, but I can only do the best that I can." 
</P>
<P>
 When Piazza finishes his daily workouts, he usually goes back to his 
condominium on the beach, where he rooms with first baseman Eric Karros and 
pitcher Greg Hansell, and regroups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to take a walk on the beach and do something like feed the sea gulls," 
Piazza said. "It helps to keep my mind simple. Because I know that someday all 
of the fanfare will end, and when it's over, I want to be the same person that 
I was before." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Under the guidance of hitting coach Reggie Smith, outfielder Darryl Strawberry 
has altered his swing this spring. The wide loop at the start has been 
minimized and the follow-through elongated. The results in batting practice 
have been positive.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the loop, which has been part of Strawberry's trademark swing, 
needed to be reduced because it put added stress on Strawberry's surgically 
repaired back. "I think that's what caused (his back problem) in the first 
place," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Vice President Fred Claire said reports on the condition of 
Strawberry's back are good. "(Team physical therapist) Pat Screnar said the 
Darryl we have known has never been stronger," Claire said. MARYANN HUDSON

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; DISARCINA LIKELY TO GET LUCRATIVE DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels, continuing their attempts to avoid future arbitration, have 
offered shortstop Gary DiSarcina a three-year contract worth nearly $2.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 DiSarcina, projected to be the club's most experienced position player despite 
his relatively brief 2 1/2 years of major league service, is expected to agree 
to the deal by Thursday.He earned $265,000 last season, and was being offered 
about $350,000 this season until the Angels made their three-year proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's a sign of confidence they have in me," DiSarcina said Tuesday at 
Tempe, Ariz. "I think in part I earned it by having two solid years, but they 
certainly don't have to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 DiSarcina, who batted .238 with 45 runs batted in last season, played in 211 
consecutive games before suffering a broken thumb when he was hit by a pitch by 
Baltimore's Ben McDonald on Aug. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Angel Manager Buck Rodgers maintains that he has no stopper in the 
bullpen, Mike Butcher respectfully begs to differ. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked (hard) to get this job," said Butcher, a reliever who signed a 
one-year contract Tuesday, "and I'm taking it. I'm telling everybody I'm going 
to be the closer. . . . I don't want to sound cocky but I want to erase all 
doubt." BOB NIGHTENGALE

PREP BASEBALL '94: CENTURY LEAGUE; FOOTHILL ENJOYS FRUIT OF PICKLER FAMILY TREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Foothill's Jeff Pickler has been around baseball as long as he can remember 
and then some. In fact, he was holding a little rubber bat and ball in his 
first baby picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you expect when your father is a coach?" said Pickler, the Knights' 
senior second baseman. 
</P>
<P>
 So he has grown up with baseball. And now he's matured into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickler came of age last season. He hit .425 with seven doubles and 19 runs 
batted in for the Knights. Numbers that are a testament not only to talent, but 
also to hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the result of a summer spent between the batting cages and the weight 
room. Pickler was always a solid player, but he became a quality one. 
</P>
<P>
 "He stepped forward," Coach Gerry Sedoo said. "When he was a freshman, he 
obviously had the knowledge and desire. But he really put in the time to become 
better. He has a good work ethic. Obviously it comes from his home situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Pickler is the son of Cypress baseball Coach Scott Pickler. He grew up around 
the baseball fields with his dad. 
</P>
<P>
 "He started playing as soon as he could pick up a bat," Scott Pickler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Pickler began playing when he was 4. His father, who was working for 
Anaheim Parks and Recreation, signed Jeff up in a league for 6- to 8-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, things didn't always go well between father and son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was umpiring one game and Jeff tried to stretch a double into a triple," 
Pickler said. "I called him out and he didn't like that. He wouldn't get off 
the bag." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jeff Pickler: "He tells that story all the time. I really don't remember 
it. But I bet Dad blew the call." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there were plenty of benefits to having a father as a baseball coach. 
It gave Jeff Pickler not only someone to play catch with, like most fathers, 
but also a skilled coach to help correct flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never really pushed me into the sport, but he was there to help," Pickler 
said. "I think he might have been frustrated a little when I was younger 
because I didn't want to go hit every day. But he knew I'd come around." 
</P>
<P>
 He did when he entered Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickler got serious about the game as a freshman. He started hanging out with 
some of the older players and they helped him develop. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickler said Neil Garcia, now a catcher at Nevada, worked out with him almost 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gave me someone to hit with and lift with," Pickler said. "He got me 
motivated." 
</P>
<P>
 Pickler moved into the starting lineup last season. He began as the team's No. 
8 hitter, but quickly moved up in the order. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit second most of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Starting out in the eight spot really helped," Pickler said. "I saw a lot 
more fastballs and built some confidence.  
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I could hit on the varsity level, but you're never completely sure 
until you do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pickler was sure by the time the Knights played their season opener against 
Tustin. He went two for three against the Tillers, who eventually won the 
Southern Section Division III championship. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished as the team's second-leading batter, behind David Trentine (.513). 
He also led the team in runs scored with 22. 
</P>
<P>
 What Pickler would like to improve on this season is the team's record. The 
Knights finished last in the Century League a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't wait for this season to start," Pickler said. "We worked hard during 
the winter. I think I hit every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Which must have made Dad proud. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jeff Pickler: "He might be my second toughest critic. After me." 1993 In 
Review / Highlights 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill was the only team not in the race for a playoff berth heading into 
the final week of the season, as five teams finished within two games of each 
other. Canyon beat Orange three times, but the Comanches lost to Villa Park on 
the last day of the season and it cost them a share of the league title and the 
No. 1 berth into the playoffs. Still, Canyon reached the quarterfinals of the 
Southern Section Division II playoffs. The Comanches upset No. 3-seeded 
Riverside Poly in the first round and then defeated Paramount. Canyon then lost 
to Temecula Valley. Orange, which had gone 1-14 in league play the previous 
season, also reached the quarterfinals. The Panthers defeated Manhatten Beach 
Mira Costa in the first round and Riverside Arlington in the second. They then 
lost to West Covina South Hills. Santa Ana Valley, the league's co-champion, 
lost to Chino Don Lugo. . . . Orange's Saul Archuleta was the league's 
co-player of the year with Santa Ana Valley's Martin Ortega. Ortega led the 
league in hitting with a .515 average. David Trentine of Foothill hit .513, 
James Jekums of Canyon hit .493, Jeff Pickler .425 and Archuleta .410. Trentine 
also drove in 28 runs and Ortega 25. Ortega also scored 25 runs. . . . Corey 
Cruz of Canyon was the league's big winner as a pitcher. He went 9-2 with a 
1.47 earned-run average. Scott Henderson of Villa Park may have been the 
league's most talented pitcher. Henderson went 6-3 with a 1.92 ERA and 97 
strikeouts. He beat Canyon with a three-hit, 11-strikeout performance in the 
season finale to cost the Comanches a share of the league title. Henderson, who 
is playing at USC, was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays in the middle rounds 
of the June amateur baseball draft. Standings 05,18,05,05,06,05 *2*League

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; DISARCINA LIKELY TO GET LUCRATIVE DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In yet another attempt to preserve their nucleus without enduring the strain 
of arbitration, the Angels have offered shortstop Gary DiSarcina a three-year 
contract worth nearly $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 DiSarcina, projected to be the Angels' most experienced everyday position 
player this season despite only 2 1/2 years of major league service, is 
expected to reach an agreement with the club by Thursday. He earned $265,000 
last season, and was being offered about $350,000 this season until the Angels' 
three-year proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's a sign of confidence they have in me," DiSarcina said. "I think 
in part I earned it by having two solid years, but they certainly don't have to 
do this. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, this is a chance for three years of security. If you told me I'd have 
a chance at a multi-year contract at the age of 26, I never would have believed 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 DiSarcina, who batted .238 with 45 runs batted in last season, played in 211 
consecutive games before sustaining a broken thumb Aug. 26 when he was hit by a 
pitch thrown by Baltimore Oriole starter Ben McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Angel Manager Buck Rodgers insists he has no bullpen stopper, reliever 
Mike Butcher respectfully begs to differ. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked my butt off to get this job," said Butcher, who signed a one-year 
contract Tuesday, "and I'm taking it. I'm telling everybody I'm going to be the 
closer." 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher, 27, was successful in eight of 10 save opportunities last season 
until undergoing season-ending surgery Sept. 7 to remove bone chips from his 
right elbow. He stayed in Tempe throughout the winter for therapy, and has 
regained his arm strength. 
</P>

 Starter Lee Guetterman, who was hit by a line drive in his left biceps Monday, 
felt fine Tuesday and will be able to pitch in today's intrasquad game. BOB

FIXATIONS: LIFE AFTER NEAR-DEATH; CHANGED FOR GOOD, DIANNE MORRISSEY LEADS 
'JOURNEY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS' AT OCC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In her courses covering the paranormal, Dianne Morrissey likes to think she is 
able to bring a sensible amount of skepticism to people's stories of 
supernatural events. 
</P>
<P>
 But then again, she says, "I never want to doubt someone's experience when 
they say they've had one. Who am I to say they didn't have their experience 
when I'm walking around saying I died once and came back?" 
</P>
<P>
 That is a bit of a conversation stopper, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 Morrissey's classes, titled "Parapsychology ESP: Journey Into Consciousness" 
(one commences at 7 tonight at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa; call (714) 
432-5880 for information), cover an interesting range of subjects, including 
Tarot card readings and willing traffic signals to change, but those rather 
pale beside the notion of talking to someone who has actually dropped dead. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the core wonders of the human experience has always been: What is it 
like to cross that mysterious veil, to broach the infinite? Are there ATMs on 
the other side? Is sloughing off one's corporeal body the dramatic weight-loss 
plan we've all hoped for? Does Tylenol still work when you're dead?  
</P>
<P>
 As one might expect, being dead certainly got Morrissey's attention, and her 
time spent on the "other side" changed her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to see where I was electrocuted?" Morrissey asked, leading to the 
den of her nice and normal Santa Fe Springs home. Now 45, she was 28 in 1977 
when she was cleaning her wall-mounted aquarium one day and a faulty pump 
squirted water carrying 117 volts into her mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stayed standing while I watched my physical body fall out of me. I was 
thrown with such force from where I was standing that my head, of my physical 
body, went right through the drywall about a foot and a half above the floor. 
The vacuum had been next to me and my arm hooked around it as I fell, and I 
took that through the wall too. So I fell hard, but I never felt it, because I 
was already out of my body, standing watching. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd never even heard of an out-of-body experience. There weren't the books on 
it that there are now. I was raised a very religious Catholic, was the office 
manager of a big construction company in downtown L.A., played professional 
clarinet at night, and if anyone had asked me if I thought I would ever do 
anything weird like the paranormal, I'd have said, impossible ," Morrissey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, there she was watching her body on the ground and aware of being in a 
separate, transparent astral body. She says she was unconscious for 45 minutes 
and was told later her heart had stopped for a portion of that time. She 
already knew that, claiming she had been aware of having a choice of returning 
to her body or not. There are now masses of data on near-death experiences 
(which has earned its own acronym: NDE), and Morrissey says only 6% of those 
experiencing them know that they are dead. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened while she was out there?  
</P>
<P>
 "Initially it's a surprise, to find that the you that's conscious, that 
thinks, perceives, feels emotions and loves, is the part that is out of your 
body," she said. Like other of the now much-documented NDE cases, she recalls 
being aware of the physical world but unable to interact with it. She tried 
calling to her dog, but he didn't respond. She tried touching things and her 
hand went through them, including a person whose attention she tried to get on 
the street outside her house. 
</P>
<P>
 But, like other NDEers, she also was aware of another dimension, including a 
tunnel she passed through, a beckoning, enveloping light and a benevolent 
being. Many people brought back from death recall meeting with loved ones, but 
in Morrissey's case, it was a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
 "She looked like a person, but she was transparent. She had brownish, 
shoulder-length hair, a little bit turned under. I felt that she was real and 
that she cared a great deal for me. I had a great childhood, but if I took all 
my parents' love and multiplied it by 100 million it wouldn't be close to how 
much this lady loved me. It was that strong. And she cared so much in helping 
me trying to decide whether to stay or come back," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other accounts, she said the entirety of her life was unreeled before 
her, but not in the judgmental manner her religion had led her to expect. Then 
there was the light, too bright for her to look at steadily, that reached out 
in a pinprick until it touched the middle finger of her right hand, "and I lost 
all sense of my transparent body. I was still me, still conscious, but I was in 
the light, and I knew the light was God. . . .It was much better than any 
sister or priest had told me heaven was. It was like feeling all things in the 
universe at the same time, like perceiving every grain of sand on every planet 
and knowing why each grain was in its place. I knew that if I went into the 
light, I would never die. Everything just changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I could stay there or come back. And I really thought I was picking to 
stay dead, so I guess we don't always get what we want. I didn't have a death 
wish; it was just so wonderful, so spectacular. Part of me absolutely wanted to 
go into the light. Another part of me felt this pulling from my stomach, the 
feeling that I wanted to be able to touch something again.  
</P>
<P>
 "I dove into the back of my physical body's neck. I felt the shag carpeting 
there between my fingertips, and then I absolutely knew I wasn't on the other 
side and just cried buckets. I couldn't believe then that I had picked to come 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And perhaps some of you can't believe you're reading this account in an actual 
newspaper, as opposed to the tabloid type, where post-death doings vie for 
space with alien abductions and Liz's liposuctions. 
</P>
<P>
 I, for one, tend to chalk most smug New-Age revelations up to folks tripping 
on moldy granola. At the same time, though, I know a sufficient number of 
credible people who have had incredible experiences that I wouldn't discount 
anything. And given what passes for daily life, it's hard to view paranormal 
events as being any weirder. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrissey struck me as being sincere in recalling her time out-of-body. She 
also doesn't clutter her work up with unnecessary mumbo-jumbo designed to 
impart an air of exclusivity. Rather, she says, "In my class I try to let 
people understand that these things are pretty common, that it's not anything 
magical and doesn't come from any special powers. I think it's just part of 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 After her near-death, she says she began seeing auras around people and 
objects, had out-of-body experiences in her sleep and other psychic 
occurrences. One day she heard Dr. Thelma Moss, then head of parapsychology 
studies at UCLA, discussing Kirlian photography on a talk radio program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd thought I was the only one. I had no idea others had had this happen to 
them. Then I heard her talking about how people glow, and how she could take 
pictures of it. It sounded like what I thought I was seeing. I called the 
station and was too embarrassed to talk on the air, so I asked if I could call 
her. I thought she would be able to make it stop, since she seemed to know what 
it was." 
</P>
<P>
 She got to know Moss and was asked to talk to one of her classes about her 
experience. The students seemed interested in what she had to say, and she had 
been feeling a growing urge to share her encounter with bliss and the world it 
opened up to her, so she sought other speaking engagements, taking long lunch 
hours from her job to speak to women's clubs and other organizations.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983 she organized classes in parapsychology, and speaking became her 
full-time job. In her classes she shies away from the more spiritual 
implications of her dead-time, focusing more on "objective information" about 
all aspects of the paranormal.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to change anybody's beliefs. That's not what my class is about. 
It's just that many people are misinformed horribly about what paranormal 
things are. What they are is very common, and they happen to most people. What 
brings many people to my class is they have had out-of-body experiences or had 
been visited by a relative who had just died. They're wondering, 'Did I really 
see this? Am I the only one this has happened to?' The class makes people feel 
OK with their experiences." 
</P>
<P>
 She categorizes her students as "everyday working people, not weirdos." Part 
of the curriculum for the four-week, non-credit, $57 course are exercises aimed 
at increasing ESP skills. She says it would be fraudulent to guarantee results, 
but does add, "I think everyone is somewhat intuitive and, like typing, if you 
practice you can get better at it." 
</P>
<P>
 She says women tend to have an edge in telepathy -- in projecting dream images 
to loved ones and such -- but it is mostly men who make up the 5% of students 
in her classes who claim they have the ability to influence traffic signals to 
change. Others report that street lights dim or go out when they pass under 
them. Morrissey says these are examples of psychokinesis.  
</P>
<P>
 Though she no longer sees the whole world in auras, Morrissey says her 
near-death experience has changed every aspect of her life. She has grown less 
judgmental in her religious leanings, and, where she once played classical 
music in local orchestras, she now prefers the less rigid sounds of jazz and 
blues. She sleeps half as much, quit wearing a watch, started recycling and 
became so concerned about the state of the world that when she watches 
politicians on TV, "it makes me furious most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I died, when people remarked about how different I was, my common 
little joke to them was, 'I haven't changed at all. You have.' Because the 
whole world looked different to me: my feelings about life, about what things 
were important, how important it was to be with people, to participate fully, 
not just say 'hello' without meaning it. You should mean it because every 
little second counts so much. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a day goes by that I don't think about the light. I guess you could say 
in some ways I regret coming back. I look forward so much to dying it's 
overwhelming sometimes. Yet my experience has also taught me to deeply love 
this world."

ROBIN ABCARIAN: PARENTS' GREATEST INEVITABLE BLOOPER

<P>
 My 18-month-old daughter was imprisoned in her highchair, having a snack. I 
was horizontal, recuperating from stomach flu. The TV was on. A child was 
saying goodby to his mother. It was a maudlin scene, one that was milked for 
all it was worth. My daughter looked alarmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That mama's going bye-bye," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 She burst into tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mamaaaaaa," she wailed, pointing at the set. "Bye-byeeeeee." 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't worry," I said, trying to calm my hysterical child. "That baby is going 
to be just fine." 
</P>
<P>
 I should sue the producers of this movie for intentional infliction of 
emotional distress on a baby. Maybe a class-action suit is in order. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone else out there got a kid traumatized by "Dumbo"? 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as she could walk, I knew television was going to be an issue. She is 
drawn to it like a dog to a dirty diaper, punching the buttons, running scared 
but proud when she gets the volume to jet engine levels. By trial and error, 
she has taught herself how to use the remote control. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, I know, there are parents reading this whose lips are curling into smug 
grins, who are shaking their heads and feeling sorry for me because I have 
exposed my precious child's sponge-like brain to the nefarious influence of the 
idiot box. 
</P>
<P>
 To those poor souls, I can only say this: You will never, ever know the joy of 
explaining to your child how the laws of physics are different in cartoons, and 
how dropping the iron on the dog's head could kill it. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting your child in front of a television is as dangerous as smoking your 
first cigarette and enjoying the high. With smoking, you think: I'll only 
borrow cigarettes. Then: OK, I'll buy a pack, but never a carton. By then, 
you're a goner. 
</P>
<P>
 With TV, you think: I'll only let her watch "Sesame Street" while I take a 
shower and blow my hair dry. Then: I'll only let her watch PBS Kid Zone 
programs such as "Mister Rogers," "Lambchops Play-Along" and "Sesame Street." 
Next thing you know, Barney is rearing his purple pea-brained head. 
</P>
<P>
 We have yet to formulate a coherent and binding set of television regulations 
for our daughter, but when we do, I can assure you, expediency will be a major 
factor. We will, for instance, let her watch Barney, not because we can stand 
him, but because he is on when the services of the box-shaped baby-sitter are 
required. 
</P>
<P>
 And isn't that what good parenting is all about? 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, my sister, Jennifer, owned a greeting card company that 
specialized in snappy, sympathetic messages for overwrought mothers and 
underappreciated secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
 She corralled me into brainstorming sessions during which we'd sit around 
dreaming up punch lines for the cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "And on the Seventh Day, God rested," for example. "His secretary, as usual, 
put in an eight-hour day." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best-selling cards, though, was aimed at first-time parents: "The 
three biggest myths of parents-to-be" it went. "We'll never bribe our little 
one with sweets. We'll never use the TV as a baby-sitter. And, of course, our 
lives won't change." 
</P>
<P>
 I, for one, think parents who bribe their children with sugar are no better 
than criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, are graham crackers considered sweets? 
</P>
<P>
 We stood in the elevator clucking, my colleague and I. She had just returned 
from visiting friends in another city, friends who have not allowed television 
into the life of their 7-year-old son, friends who gave the boy a ball of 
string and a ream of paper for Christmas, because he would have "so much more 
fun" with them than with toys. 
</P>
<P>
 A ball of string?  
</P>
<P>
 Yep.  
</P>
<P>
 No television?  
</P>
<P>
 Nope.  
</P>
<P>
 What's he like?  
</P>
<P>
 Sweet . . . but different. We took him to a movie and he thought the bad guys 
were going to jump off the screen and come after him.  
</P>
<P>
 You are kidding me!  
</P>
<P>
 Nope .  
</P>
<P>
 We went on like that until the elevator doors opened. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no sport so satisfying as trashing another parent's child-rearing 
techniques. Especially when it comes to television. 
</P>
<P>
 My husband and daughter were sitting on the bed, both clutching bottles, eyes 
fixed on the television set. (Juice for her, Heineken for him.) On the screen, 
two black-and-white glamour pusses, in close-up. "Casablanca." Rick was telling 
Ilsa that the troubles of two people don't amount to a hill of beans in this 
crazy world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think this is appropriate for her to be seeing," I clucked. 
</P>
<P>
 "So change it." 
</P>
<P>
 I turned on cartoons. Wile E. Coyote was getting smashed by an Acme Co. anvil. 
</P>
<P>
 "You think this mayhem is better for her than 'Casablanca'?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, on a Moroccan airstrip. . . .

TURNING DOWN THE RACKET; HEARING: LOUD MUSIC CAN DAMAGE THE EARS. SO, WHILE THE 
SEARCH IS ON FOR TINNITUS AND HYPERACUSIS CURES, THE FOCUS IS ON PREVENTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Elizabeth Meyer knew something was wrong when she returned from an 
African-music concert in Seattle and noticed a slight ringing in her ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got worse over several weeks," she says. "I noticed sounds were slightly 
distorted, as though there were reverberations in my head." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Portland, Ore., resident went for a hearing test, doctors told her 
that she was suffering from tinnitus -- a maddening, persistent noise emanating 
from within her head -- and hyperacusis, a painful sensitivity to sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got so bad it sounded like the highest sound (that) truck brakes make," 
she says. "I had to physically restrain myself from jumping up and smashing my 
head against the wall for the first year." 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to banish the tinnitus, which she hears as a continual thin, screechy 
noise, Meyer grew despondent, and that only made things worse. "I couldn't cry, 
because the sound of my own sobbing hurt my ears," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, thousands of people suffer some degree of hearing impairment from 
listening to loud music. Although most learn to live with it, for others it is 
a debilitating, life-altering experience. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many sources of exposure: over-amplified music at live concerts, the 
bone-shaking thump of speaker-packed "boom cars" and lightweight portable 
tape-player headphones. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as veteran rockers such as Pete Townshend join the chorus of doctors 
and scientists warning of too much volume, pleas to turn it down still mostly 
fall on deaf ears among those who live by the slogan, "If it's too loud, you're 
too old." 
</P>
<P>
 Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines say a person can 
safely withstand continuous noise of 90 decibels for eight hours, 100 decibels 
for two hours and 110 decibels for half an hour. But a rock concert, which may 
last more than two hours, can exceed 120 decibels, and stereo headphones can 
produce 115 decibels. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. John House, an otologist with the House Ear Clinic and president of the 
nonprofit House Ear Institute in Los Angeles, says 80% of his patients with a 
hearing loss also have tinnitus, which may sound like continuous ringing, 
buzzing or hissing. 
</P>
<P>
 While many people suffer on-the-job hearing loss, among younger patients music 
is the most likely culprit, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's mostly live music, and it's mostly concerts," House says. "I would say 
10% of people who are regularly involved with music do suffer some hearing loss 
or tinnitus." 
</P>
<P>
 Hyperacusis, which is much less common, results mostly from rock concerts, he 
says. Sufferers "really become miserable because they can't go out in public." 
</P>
<P>
 The first sign of damaged hearing is ringing and a muffled sensation, known as 
temporary threshold shift. This usually lasts a few hours to a few days, then 
subsides. Young concert-goers often ignore such warnings. "The problem is, 
every time they're doing that, they're doing some damage," House says. 
</P>
<P>
 As hearing loss progresses, people have a hard time hearing certain 
frequencies, making it difficult to understand conversation amid background 
noise, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 James Kelly, a hearing researcher at the University of New Mexico, says loud 
noises damage the delicate mechanism of the inner ear. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound waves are transmitted through the fluid-filled cochlea, which is lined 
with microscopic hair cells, each "tuned" to pick up a specific frequency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hair cells are delicate," Kelly says. "They're sensitive to motions that are 
less than the diameter of a hydrogen atom." 
</P>
<P>
 When exposed to a loud sound, some hair cells are flayed and laid flat, Kelly 
says. Nerve fibers at the end of each hair cell also swell tremendously, he 
says. Tinnitus seems to arise in the irritated nerve cells, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors can't do much to alleviate tinnitus, although they may prescribe 
steroids to reduce inner-ear swelling and anti-depressants or anti-anxiety 
drugs for those who suffer emotionally from the incessant noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists meanwhile are studying the ears of birds, which apparently can 
regenerate inner-ear hair cells, to see if people can be helped, Kelly says. 
</P>
<P>
 With no cure for tinnitus and hyperacusis, the primary focus is on prevention, 
says Charlie Lahaie, director of public relations and community outreach at the 
House Ear Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real hard to get across to kids, 'You're going to have a hearing loss,' 
" she says. "Of course, when you're a teen-ager, nothing's going to hurt you." 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, the institute joined with Mix Magazine and a group of music 
professionals to launch the HIP (Hearing Is Priceless) campaign, which produces 
educational videos and distributes ear plugs. 
</P>
<P>
 HIP advisory board member Nathan East, a bass player who has toured and 
recorded with Eric Clapton, has used custom-molded musicians' earplugs since 
becoming concerned about ringing in his ears. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike conventional foam earplugs, which muffle high-frequency sounds in 
particular, the musicians' model reduces all frequencies about equally, so 
music still sounds the way it's supposed to, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 East says he was relieved to find he hadn't suffered much hearing loss despite 
his years of touring. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have one set of eardrums, and if you blow them out, that's all she 
wrote," he says. "It's all about preventive maintenance." 
</P>
<P>
 Although East's ears are protected, he's concerned about concert-goers who 
line the stage close to the speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worry, especially when I see people with their babies out there," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Elizabeth Meyer discovered, hearing damage doesn't always require years 
of repeated exposure to loud sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people suffer a gradual decline in their hearing, but Meyer's symptoms 
intensified within weeks of the Seattle concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors say some people are unusually sensitive to loud noise, although it's 
impossible to predict which people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard the phrase 'tough ears and tender ears,' and you never know which 
ones you have," Meyer says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, her hearing loss, which began four years ago, grew out of a 
passion for playing the African marimba, a percussion instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 "I practiced so vigorously I suffered severe tendinitis in both arms," she 
recalls. Deciding to give her body a rest, she started attending African-music 
concerts. Soon after, Meyer, 36, found that most ordinary sounds caused her 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything sounded nightmarishly amplified," she says. She couldn't listen to 
television or radio and had to put a pillow over the telephone for the few 
minutes of conversation she could bear. 
</P>
<P>
 She tried desensitizing herself to the symptoms using a masking device that 
generates white noise. Although that helped somewhat, Meyer still wears foam 
earplugs or molded custom earplugs, together with industrial-strength 
acoustical earmuffs before venturing outside. 
</P>
<P>
 They enable Meyer -- a German teacher, artist and poet -- to at least ride the 
bus, although, she says, "I still have to really ration my traveling." 
</P>
<P>
 The measures Meyer must take to cope with her hearing loss affect virtually 
every facet of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really gets in the way of dating situations," she says, "because the 
normal kinds of things people do together, I can't do." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she's moved far beyond the stage of feeling suicidal about her plight. 
She now serves as an educator and resource person for others experiencing a 
hearing loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing a lot better," she says. "I tell myself sometimes, 'When things get 
really bad, they get better, and if they don't get better, I'll develop better 
coping skills.' " Where to Turn

FAMILY; TO SURVIVE TEENS, THINK POSITIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Teen-agers can be surly, sometimes behaving so negatively Mother Teresa 
couldn't cope. 
</P>
<P>
 Their parents, on the other hand, are long-suffering souls just trying to keep 
a positive outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 Those stereotypes have just been blown by Ohio State University psychologist 
Raymond Montemayor, who videotaped conversations between teen-agers and parents 
to observe their voice tones, body language and facial expressions. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise: as puberty progressed, parents showed a larger increase in 
negativity than did their children. The finding is based on numerous videotaped 
conversations in 85 two-parent, middle-class families with children ranging 
from ages 11 to 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake: Overall, teen-agers still win the negativity race. But the 
parents' negativity escalated faster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adolescents are almost always more negative toward their parents than the 
parents are toward the kids," Montemayor says. In the study, teen-agers were 
likely to be negative in 15% of conversations, while parents were negative in 
9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Mothers and daughters are likely to have the most heated relationships, he 
found, while fathers and sons spar the least. That's because women tend to 
express emotions more than men do, he speculates, or because they are more 
involved in their teens' day-to-day lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Puberty is a family affair," concludes Montemayor, who has a 15-year-old 
daughter. "It doesn't just affect the child but also the parents -- and may be 
more stressful for parents than teens." KATHLEEN DOHENY

 Two brave women who in their teens waged and won personal battles with cancer 
will be the featured speakers at a Circle 1000 brunch on April 6 at the Four 
Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Diana Golden of Aspen, a world-class ski racer, and Susan Nessim of Los 
Angeles, founder of the national support group Cancervive, will address guests 
at the annual benefit that has presented speakers such as Betty Rollin, Nancy 
Reagan, Dave Dravecky and Peter Ueberroth. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a little deviation from what we've done in the past," says Arden 
Flamson, Circle 1000 chairwoman. "We've never had two speakers. These are 
outstanding, enthusiastic young women. Generally, our speakers have been older. 
The point is, cancer can strike at any age." Proceeds will benefit the Hoag 
Cancer Center in Newport Beach. For ticket information, call (714) 645-8600.

 Saluting Floss and Ed: The International Children's Choir kicked off the gala 
"Gift of Love" celebration that saluted Ed and Floss Schumacher at the Center 
Club in Costa Mesa on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Orange County residents -- who now live in Palm Desert -- were 
honored by the UCI Child Development Center and given its first James 
Satterfield Service Award. (Satterfield, who recently retired, was a forerunner 
in research for children with attention deficit hyperactive disorder and other 
learning disabilities.) 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Frank Crinella, clinical professor of pediatrics and director of the 
developmental disabilities research program a UCI, was master of ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Event proceeds of $25,000 will go toward development of a Child Development 
Center on the UCI campus.

 Can We CHOC?: Joan Rivers look-alike Dee Dee Hanson helped entertain patrons 
of Children's Hospital of Orange County's upcoming fashion show at the Center 
Club on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Draped in gobs of pearls and sporting Rivers' signature bumble-bee pin, Hanson 
worked the room, complimenting guests on their outfits and cracking them up as 
they dived into a buffet of chicken piccata, omelets, Belgian waffles and 
fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets are still available for CHOC's I. Magnin fashion show, which will be 
staged on two consecutive days at the Anaheim Marriott: March 17 ($55 per 
person luncheon) and 18 ($100 per person dinner.) For information, call (714) 
532-8675. Dana Davis is chairwoman.

 Sweethearts: More than 400 guests jammed the ballroom at the Four Seasons 
Hotel in Newport Beach on Saturday to honor Charles and Nora Hester -- named 
Sweet Heart Couple by the Heart Committee of Hoag Hospital's 552 Club. 
</P>
<P>
 During the festivities, gala co-chairmen John and Fran Applegate performed a 
pantomime that recalled eras from the couple's life.  
</P>
<P>
 The Hesters were honored for their ongoing support of community projects. 
Proceeds of $120,00 will go to Hoag Heart Institute's Cardiac Care Services 
Outpatient Center.

 Saluting a savvy leader: Opera Pacific's Guild Alliance founder Laila Conlin 
was honored at a dinner held at the Center Club on Friday. Conlin, the guild 
president who took its membership from 100 to 1,100-plus in eight years, has 
been named guilds chairman. Gloria Gellman will succeed her as president. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're glad this step doesn't mean Laila is stepping down," said Richard 
Deary, Opera Pacific's director of volunteer services. "She's a very savvy 
leader who believes that the way to keep an organization strong is to introduce 
new leaders with fresh ideas."  
</P>
<P>
 Gala co-chairwomen were Ellie Burg and Margaret Price. Proceeds from the $60 
per person event will go to Opera Pacific's annual High School Vocal 
Competition.

INTO THE NIGHT / BILL HIGGINS: FETING STUFF THAT'S NOT HOME SHOPPING

 The Scene: Monday's opening reception at the Four Seasons for the New 
York-based Museum of Television & Radio's 11th festival. It's at the L.A. 
County Museum today through March 19. Shows ranging from "77 Sunset Strip" to 
"Roseanne" will be screened, then discussed with their creators. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Predominantly television producers and network execs. The 500 
guests included MT&R President Robert Batscha, board chairman Frank Bennack, 
Annie Potts, Red Buttons, Marvin and Barbara Davis, Sid Caesar, Howard 
Hesseman, Grant Tinker, Carroll O'Connor, Alan Alda, David Kelley, Steven 
Bochco and Peter Bogdanovich. "If a bomb went off in this room," said 
"Simpsons" creator Matt Groening, "all we'd have left is the home shopping 
network." 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: Producer Diane English on the museum: "To me, it's a time capsule in a 
big building in New York. If you watch anything from 'The Honeymooners' to 
'Murphy Brown' to 'NYPD Blue,' it gives you an idea of who we were at that 
point in history." 
</P>
<P>
 Also Quoted: "I have taken an oath of celibacy regarding television," said 
Peter Bergman of radio's legendary Firesign Theater. "I watch only the 
occasional natural disaster. I'm sure I've missed some good things, but no one 
has told me about them." 
</P>
<P>
 Chow: The MT&R travels first class. There were chefs sauteing mushrooms with 
sun-dried tomatoes, steak and chicken fajitas, and carved turkeys. "For a 
nonprofit, this is a pretty good spread," observed Norman Lear. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastimes: There were monitors playing great moments in television (one guest 
noted that every time he looked, someone was being assassinated), an 
eight-minute tape of 30-second bites from each festival show, and the 
announcement that the MT&R will open a Richard Meier-designed branch in Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 A Succinct Distillation of Why Almost Everyone Goes to Hollywood Parties: "I'm 
50," said actor Max Gail. "I've got four kids. I see braces coming. I see 
college coming. I figure I better do some networking." 
</P>
<P>
 What to Watch for at the Festival: LACMA's budget-strapped staff pressing 
their noses against the windows like Dickensian urchins as they wonder why in 
the world they didn't become curators for couch potatoes.

THE FALL COLLECTIONS / MILAN; OF YOUTH, SPARKLE, FAUX FUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Dressing the modern schoolgirl in cropped jackets, skinny pants, short full 
skirts and jumper dresses, Giorgio Armani's Emporio Armani collection gave a 
much needed jolt Monday to the Italian fall ready-to-wear shows, which have 
sputtered along here since Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Emporio is the Italian master's young line -- his signature collection will be 
shown tonight -- and it was very young, but pleasingly so. Jumper dresses and 
baby-dolls came in demure florals, woolen knits and, for evening, in velvet 
with sequin tanks underneath, or in splotchy tweeds pieced together with smooth 
silks. 
</P>
<P>
 Short, strong-shouldered jackets, in velveteen with frog closures, were worn 
over slim pants. Often these jackets were worn with longer vests for an 
eccentric, layered effect. Short jackets alternated with longer, 
slope-shouldered designs, worn with tight vests and fluid trousers. Tiers of 
ruffles were a recurring "girlie" theme. Iridescent leathers added the season's 
all-important shine. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolce & Gabbana's collection, shown Sunday, had the hot design duo doing what 
they do best -- masculine pantsuits offset by saucy starlet attire. With 
Isabella Rossellini on the runway, the collection had a maximum of verve and a 
minimum of gimmicks. Boucle miniskirt suits with tight little jackets trimmed 
in what looked like faux fur were as sexy as could be. At Dolce & Gabbana, 
Lurex turtlenecks and sequined tops sparkled under sedate menswear-ish suits. A 
cropped tank in fuzzy mohair topped a floor-sweeping sheer slip. A longhaired 
shearling coat was deliciously mangy. The designing boys (Domenico and Stefano) 
managed interesting mixes of materials -- mohair and chiffon, faux leopard and 
tweed -- and such accessible novelties as sweater sleeves sewn onto tweed 
jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 Those forward-thinking fashion victims out there who have been wondering what 
they'll wear to the opening of "The Flintstones" movie need look no further 
than Gianni Versace's Versus secondary line. Overseen by the designer's 
spitfire sister Donatella, Versus took a twisted take on couture styles, 
dishing up lunch-lady clothes in mixed animal prints to the strains of Nancy 
Sinatra's "These Boots Are Made for Walking." 
</P>
<P>
 It was jaw-droppingly over-the-top, what with spotted jackets worn with 
leather jumpers, striped velveteen jackets over zebra pants, men in leopard 
pants, faux-fur change purses dangling off belts, doughnut-shaped pillbox hats. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Versace's other secondary line, Istante, made the season's biggest case for 
shine -- whether the shimmer of metal or the gloss of patent. But it wasn't 
anything we haven't already seen from American designer Anna Sui. There were 
pastel metallics, a couple of beautiful long lame and Lurex pleated dresses, 
and a red crinkled patent mini-dress. Glen plaid suits were studded in 
rhinestones and worn over Lurex turtlenecks.  
</P>
<P>
 The Missoni show was truly no biggie. Everything looked like ikat cloth, a 
Gustav Klimt painting or some ancient tapestry or other. Only the company's 
signature ombre leggings will turn heads (for the right reasons) on the street 
next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Byblos show began with hooded Lurex knits and sporty iridescent jackets. 
What looked best were a satin three-piece pants suit, a cut velvet suit, a 
cropped glen plaid swing jacket over tan velveteen pants, and gunmetal lame 
quilted jackets worn with Lurex knits.

 Brazil Tries a 12th Anti-Inflation Index: The government introduced the real 
value unit, or URV, an index designed to curb runaway inflation.The URV, pegged 
to the U.S. dollar, will be used to calculate salaries and, eventually, all 
financial transactions. The index replaces 11 others that, over the years, have 
been used to determine everything from interest rates to grocery prices. The 
new one is supposed to reduce inflation, now running at more than 40% a month, 
to a single-digit figure. Last year, inflation reached an annual rate of 
2,567%.

 Uncle Sam says thanks to Melrose Industries for buying American. 
</P>
<P>
 The small Huntington Beach company leases U.S. merchant ships to export its 
product: bulk paper used to make toilet and facial tissue.On Thursday, the U.S. 
Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration will award the paper 
broker a certificate of appreciation during a ceremony on the Queen Mary in 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We give preference to American-flagged vessels," said David Rose, president 
of Melrose Industries. "Supporting the American-flagged fleet is very important 
to the overall security of the country." 
</P>
<P>
 In a national emergency, such as the Gulf War three years ago, the government 
can press American-flagged ships into service.

 Canon Computer Systems Inc. said it will ship a new version of the NextStation 
personal computer, a year after Next Computer Systems Inc. scrapped its own 
models. 
</P>
<P>
 Canon, which owns 17% of Next Computer, the 9-year-old company controlled by 
computer pioneer Steve Jobs, said it wants to raise its profile in the U.S. 
personal computer business as well as sell machines that run NextStep software. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of confidence in Canon, so we were happy to let them use our 
name," said Paul Vaiss, Next's director of strategic alliances.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Costa Mesa-based Canon Computer said they plan to ship their own 
NextStation PC, powered by Intel Corp. 486 chips, late in the second quarter.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: HONORING HIS CAESARSHIP; BROADCASTING: NEW YORK'S MUSEUM OF 
RADIO & TELEVISION KICKS OFF THE L.A. FEST WITH A TRIBUTE TO COMEDY LEGEND SID 
CAESAR TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Woman (Imogene Coca): I think the old method of spanking a child is passe . 
</P>
<P>
 Man (Sid Caesar): I say don't spank a child. Talk to the child, reason with 
him, find out what's on his mind. And when you find out the real reason, the 
cause -- then belt him.  
</P>
<P>
 On a cluttered desk in his hilltop Beverly Hills home rests a nameplate 
bearing a self-mocking title: "His Caesarship." 
</P>
<P>
 It fits. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, it's true that the so-called Golden Age of Television is largely a figment 
of legends and selective memories, that upon close examination there was much 
less gold than tin. Yet from 1949 to 1957, Sid Caesar presided over a Camelot 
of comedy, a realm of distinctively brilliant art that started with "The 
Admiral Broadway Revue," continued with "Your Show of Shows" and concluded with 
"Caesar's Hour." As a body of daring work -- performed live in a raw, scratchy, 
black-and-white medium that shunned controversy -- it's awesome. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus how appropriate that New York's Museum of Radio & Television is kicking 
off its 11th annual Los Angeles Television Festival -- which runs through March 
19 at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art -- with tonight's sold-out tribute 
to Caesar. 
</P>
<P>
 At times visited by sheer madness, his comedy characters were at once physical 
and soulful. He created sight-gag masterpieces and joined his colleagues in 
sputtering foreign dialects that were side-splitting gibberish. He also 
deployed silence as few other comic actors have, instinctively withholding 
responses until just the right millimoment. Yet above all, much of Caesar's 
comedy reflects his remarkable eye for seeing the absurd in the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 Television has had its share of comedy geniuses. Yet arguably none has been as 
uniquely gifted and inventive as Caesar. Watching him perform, you just know 
light bulbs are popping continuously in his brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, he didn't do it alone. He was in the right place at the right time, 
benefiting from an ensemble of supporting players and writers as talented as 
television has ever known. 
</P>
<P>
 His co-bananas in those days included Imogene Coca, Nanette Fabray, Carl 
Reiner and Howard Morris. Some of his writers were Mel Brooks, Larry Gelbart, 
Woody Allen, Danny Simon and Neil Simon, whose current Broadway play, "Laughter 
on the 23rd Floor," is itself about writers working for a series like "Your 
Show of Shows." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Allen, all of the above (plus other past colleagues of Caesar's, 
including Gisele MacKenzie, his comedy partner in a later series) are scheduled 
to participate in tonight's salute. They'll come . . . they'll laugh . . . 
they'll praise . . . they'll schmooze. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Not in attendance will be the late Max Liebman. He was the storied impresario 
who first paired Caesar and Coca for "The Admiral Broadway Revue" on the old 
Dumont network. Although it seems almost too quaint to believe, the series was 
canceled after one season by Admiral itself because it could not keep up with 
the demand for TV sets caused by the success of Caesar and Coca. Liebman 
translated his Admiral series into something similar on NBC, a 90-minute 
variety program titled "Your Show of Shows" -- a grueling 39 episodes a season 
-- that included four long skits and a stand-up routine each for Caesar and 
Coca. Four years later, the two were heading separate NBC shows, with Caesar 
joined by Fabray and holdovers Reiner and Morris on "Caesar's Hour." 
</P>
<P>
 But enough about that, and on with the comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "What would you like to see?" asked Caesar, 72. After consulting an index, he 
began popping in cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is Caesar's thick-accented Deutsche professor and blowhard for all 
seasons in a dented top hat and shabby formal wear lecturing Reiner's rapt 
reporter about what a mountain climber must do should he fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "You right away fill your lungs with air . . . and you start to scream. And 
you keep screaming all the vay down." 
</P>
<P>
 "But why do you keep screaming?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Dummkoph! So they know where to find you." 
</P>
<P>
 For sheer comedic brazenness, here is "The Four Englishmen," with Caesar, 
Coca, Reiner and Morris as haughty, upper-crust Britishers who remain rigid and 
unflappable in formal attire even when drenched by water from rain pouring 
through the leaky roof of their posh club. 
</P>
<P>
 Here too is Caesar in a stunning, virtuoso, rhythmically freewheeling 
stand-up, comparing nights on the town in 1939 and 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 If the famous "Your Show of Shows" parody of "This Is Your Life" isn't network 
TV's funniest sketch ever -- with Caesar as a poor schnook in the audience who 
fights having his life told and has to be chased down and carried to the stage 
-- then it's the "Caesar's Hour" spoof of "Sunset Boulevard." On the screen is 
Caesar as the brooding, macho Rex Handsome, a silent movie star whose career 
takes a turn for the worst with the advent of talkies. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a Western. The barroom doors swing open, and there is tough, fearless, 
wide-bodied Rex. "Draw!" someone says. Shots ring out. A guy tries to disarm 
Rex, but he's too quick and sends him flying. 
</P>
<P>
 Rex (in a high effeminate voice): "Anybody else looking for trouble?" 
</P>
<P>
 Movie parodies were a favorite of this great production team. The "Shane" 
satire was titled "Strange," with Caesar as the heroic Alan Ladd character and 
Coca in the worshipful Brandon de Wilde role. 
</P>
<P>
 Coca: "Gee, that's a nice gun, Strange. That's a nice holster, Strange. Nice 
gun belt, Strange. I like you, Strange. You got nice boots, Strange. You're 
nice, Strange." 
</P>
<P>
 Caesar: "Get away, kid, or I'll blast you." 
</P>
<P>
 If there were ever evidence of Caesar's mastery of the funny/sad qualities 
epitomized by Chaplin and Keaton in films, though, it was a "Pagliacci" spoof. 
On the screen, in his funny hat and satin pajamas, is Caesar as the tragic 
clown Gallipacci. Distraught after losing his woman (Fabray), he is singing 
mock Italian lyrics operatic-style to the tune of "It Was Just One of Those 
Things," while putting on his makeup and (Caesar says he improvised this) 
playing tick-tack-toe on his own face. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the entire cast of "Gallipacci" sings "The Yellow Rose of Texas." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Intently observing this still-fresh 40-year-old routine through 1994 eyes, 
Caesar sat in his office and laughed out loud. Other sketches he grinned at, 
others he watched silently, his eyes narrowing like a connoisseur standing back 
and studying a painting in a gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 It's inconceivable that the art of Sid Caesar has never been widely rerun or 
syndicated on national television. In 1973, Liebman packaged excerpts as a 
theatrical movie titled "Ten From Your Show of Shows," and Caesar said that in 
the mid-1980s Lorimar paid to edit the material into 65 shows for syndication 
but then lost interest. A couple of years ago, he said, some of them were run 
at 12:30 a.m. on cable's Comedy Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 A much better spot would be Nickelodeon's "Nick at Night," which has run lots 
of vintage black-and-white comedy series. Or syndication to local stations. "I 
don't understand why nobody wants them," Caesar said. "It's all lawyers and 
accountants today. You go to the networks, the top guy is maybe 28 or 30." 
</P>
<P>
 Humor is generational. Yet the humor of these shows remains contemporary. Is 
it that they have no continuing characters, as do such widely syndicated 
antiques as "I Love Lucy" and Jackie Gleason's "The Honeymooners"? Or is it 
that the present age of hyper comedies -- more and more of them tailored to the 
one-lines of stand-up comics -- has created vastly different appetites? 
</P>
<P>
 "I make the audience work," Caesar said. "Our comedy is mostly character. 
There are jokes, but we don't rely on them. In the 'Sunset Boulevard' parody we 
take two or three minutes just to set up. They don't have patience for that 
anymore. Today, if it goes more than three seconds without a laugh, forget it." 
</P>
<P>
 Caesar, whose favorite current comics include Robin Williams and Billy 
Crystal, also winces at another exploding phenomenon of the '90s -- 
gratuitously lewd material in monologues. That attitude will get him labeled a 
dinosaur. "I know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the screen is a parody of "The Seventh Veil," with Caesar as the tyrannical 
guardian of a pliant young pianist (Coca) whom he forces to practice around the 
clock, even making her eat and brush her teeth at the piano. "In seven short 
years, I've taken a raw, innocent girl," he boasts, "and made her a nervous 
wreck." 
</P>
<P>
 His Caesarship. Some dinosaur.

THE 36TH ANNUAL GRAMMY AWARDS; GRAMMY'S SORRY STATE, FRANKLY SPEAKING; FORGET 
THE MUSIC -- THIS YEAR THE SPOKEN WORD GETS THE ATTENTION. SO WHAT WAS THE DEAL 
WITH BONO AND SINATRA?; BACKSTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 What Bono said . . . and what Frank Sinatra didn't -- or wasn't allowed -- to 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the backstage buzz at Radio City Music Hall during Tuesday's 36th 
Annual Grammy Awards show. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bono took the stage to accept the alternative album Grammy for U2's 
"Zooropa," the singer mused about the irony of a superstar band still being 
considered alternative. "We shall continue," he said, "to abuse our position 
and (expletive) up the mainstream" (his comment on the live telecast was 
deleted for the delayed West Coast airing). 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting the press backstage, Bono feigned surprise at the furor. "I say that 
every day," he said. He also added that "if alternative means progressive, I'm 
happy with the award." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Bono's speech presenting Frank Sinatra with a Grammy Legend award, the 
rock star admitted that he had a drink or two while writing his tribute to the 
world's most famous saloon singer. 
</P>
<P>
 Another controversy surrounded the quick cut from Sinatra's rambling 
acceptance speech. Mike Greene, president of the recording academy, said the 
singer was cut off not by the program's producers, but by Sinatra's own people. 
"They could see that he was having a good time," said Greene, "and felt that he 
would have talked for about an hour." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney Houston, who collected three awards, conceded that Kevin Costner, her 
co-star in "The Bodyguard," had to persuade her to record Dolly Parton's "I 
Will Always Love You." "Kevin brought me this song," she said, "and I said, 
'This is a country song.' But I kept singing it, and feeling it, and then I 
knew that this was the song." 
</P>
<P>
 Toni Braxton won two awards -- best new artist and R&B vocal female -- and 
beamed with pride. "It's hard for me to hold these awards," she said, "because 
I really want to get down on my knees and thank God." Though expected to win 
the new artist award, she seemed surprised to win the vocal award. "I can't 
believe I beat these singers," she said. "I mean, Whitney is my favorite." 
</P>
<P>
 Digable Planets was a surprise winner for best rap group performance. One 
member of the trio, Butterfly, was nonplussed when one reporter implied that 
they didn't deserve the award. "We're dealing with an established award 
ceremony, and people might not have been drawn to vote for people who'd been 
involved in controversy," he said, a clear reference to the hottest pair in 
rap, Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what Barbra's going to say," Tony Bennett said after accepting 
the Grammy for traditional pop vocal in ceremonies before the broadcast, and 
alluding to the fact that pundits were betting on Streisand's "Back to 
Broadway" over his own "Steppin' Out." Bennett's certainly on a roll, with a 
second Grammy in as many years, and increasing visibility among both baby 
boomers and their MTV-bred children. 
</P>
<P>
 The 67-year-old singer attributes at least part of his stunning revival to 
hiring his son Danny to manage his career. "Danny got me on (MTV) and 'The 
Simpsons' and I asked him, 'What are we doing?' His reply was, 'Trust me, just 
wait.' " The wait is over, as Bennett will soon be seen on 'MTV Unplugged.' 
Adds Bennett: "I thought the generation gap was with us forever, but it seems 
to be closing up." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most spirited onstage moments was an all-star tribute to Curtis 
Mayfield that included performances by B.B. King, Bruce Springsteen and Bonnie 
Raitt. Mayfield, paralyzed from the neck down, appeared onstage at the end of 
the tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 "It lets me know that we're all the same in spite of ourselves," Mayfield said 
to the press of the fact that such a wide variety of artists relate to his 
songs. "And for me, the most exciting thing about tonight was having all my 
colleagues and peers standing around me singing 'Amen.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Staff writer Robert Levine and free-lance writer Steve Hochman contributed to 
the Grammy coverage.

THE 36TH ANNUAL GRAMMY AWARDS; GRAMMY'S SORRY STATE, FRANKLY SPEAKING; INSTEAD 
OF REWARDING MEDIOCRITY, THE RECORDING ACADEMY SHOULD FOCUS ON ITS STRENGTH -- 
ITS SALUTES TO POP LEGENDS.; POP / ROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It only took Whitney Houston 12 minutes to pick up the first of her Grammys on 
Tuesday night . . . and to trigger, most certainly, another round of complaints 
over the frequent irrelevance of an awards competition that prides itself on 
saluting recording excellence but often ends up fawning over mainstream 
mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences, which sponsors the 
annual honors, should forget about handing out Grammys altogether and focus on 
its salutes to pop legends. 
</P>
<P>
 At least then we'd be focusing on greatness. 
</P>
<P>
 Where many of the awards Tuesday seemed either arbitrary and/or dumbfounding, 
the tributes to Frank Sinatra and Curtis Mayfield registered the evening's only 
truly involving moments. 
</P>
<P>
 How many times do you get a chance to see a man with Sinatra's tough-guy image 
reduced to tears by a passionate introduction? 
</P>
<P>
 U2's Bono, setting the stage for Sinatra's Grammy Legend award, described him 
as "a singer who makes other men (songwriters) poets." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "People say Frank doesn't talk to the press. They want to know how 
he is, what's on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you know Sinatra is out there (on stage) more nights than most punk 
bands, telling his story through the songs . . . private thoughts on a public 
address system -- boxer and painter, actor and singer, band man and loner, 
trouble-shooter and troublemaker . . . the champ who would rather show you his 
scars than his medals." 
</P>
<P>
 It was probably the best introduction Sinatra ever got -- how ironic that it 
came from a rock 'n' roller, almost four decades after Sinatra virtually 
dismissed the revolutionary new sound as all but worthless. 
</P>
<P>
 And the master of phrasing didn't hide his feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the best welcome I ever had," he said. "This is like being in 
baseball, the bases are loaded and you're at bat (and) you don't know what you 
are going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a marvelous moment in pop history: This celebrated public figure, a man 
of such command and grace on stage, almost speechless as he tried to find the 
words to express his feelings on this special night. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a shame that the moment of rare intimacy was destroyed by someone's 
decision to cut him off with some award announcements and commercials, then 
return to an awards show that seemed to have so little connection with the true 
heartbeat of contemporary pop. 
</P>
<P>
 We saw Houston and her cohorts step to the microphone time after time to thank 
their staffs, their bands, their fans, their parents. Meanwhile, only Digable 
Planets, the New York trio that was honored for best rap group recording, made 
any reference to the real world -- reminding the black-tie crowd about the 
homeless people outside in the 30-degree cold and reaffirming their own goals 
of greater African American unity. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of the awards pinpointed the creative pulse of a pop music that is 
dominated, sociologically, by the anger and alienation of a new generation of 
rockers and rappers, and few of the performances also offered any sense of 
today's true pop energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerosmith representing rock in a year when Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, Pearl 
Jam and others altered the face of rock 'n' roll? 
</P>
<P>
 One way to measure the validity of an awards ceremony is to imagine a tape of 
it being put in a time capsule and opened up in 50 years. How much would 
Tuesday's ceremony tell someone then about the real heart of pop music in 1993?

MUSIC / CHRIS PASLES; A SOPRANO'S HIGHS AND LOWS; 'I JUST SING THE THINGS THAT 
SEEM RIGHT,' SAYS OPERA'S VOCALLY VERSATILE JANE EAGLEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1949, Maria Callas made the history books by singing Elvira in Bellini's "I 
Puritani" only three days after she sang Brunnhilde in Wagner's "Die Walkure." 
That kind of vocal versatility -- shifting from Wagnerian breadth and weight to 
bel canto high extension and coloratura -- hadn't been heard since Lilli 
Lehmann in the 1890s. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Eaglen had a little more time. She got about two weeks between singing 
Bellini's Norma for the Seattle Opera and coming to Costa Mesa to sing 
Brunnhilde for Opera Pacific, starting Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Callas had been substituting for an ailing colleague when she took over the 
role of Elvira. Eaglen was brought in at the last minute for both roles -- 
replacing Carol Vaness, who withdrew from "Norma" because of a back ailment, 
and Ealynn Voss, who withdrew from "Walkure" for personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's a big deal but I don't really think about it," the former member 
of the English National Opera said over lunch at her hotel here. "I just sing 
the things that seem right at the time and which seem to be right for my voice. 
I think I sing Brunnhilde and Norma very differently without consciously 
thinking, 'Oh, this is such and such, I must sing it like this.' By responding 
to the style and the nature of the music, it just kind of happens." 
</P>
<P>
 She sang her first Brunnhilde with John Mauceri and the Scottish Opera in 1991 
(Mauceri will conduct the Opera Pacific dates). Then, she had a 10-week 
rehearsal period. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Valkyries were on stilts, so they had to have the 10 weeks. It looked 
fairly impressive, I must say. . . . But it was hard not to want to kill people 
by the end of 10 weeks. It was just too long." 
</P>
<P>
 There won't be any stilts in Costa Mesa but, in another departure, the whole 
opera will be done behind a scrim. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say it looks very beautiful," Eaglen said doubtfully. "Sometimes, it can 
give a kind of mystical sort of quality to it. From a performer's point of 
view, however, you always feel that you're cut off somehow." 
</P>
<P>
 She envisions Brunnhilde as "about 15 years old. I like to try to portray her 
as a young girl who has a lot of growing up to do before the end of the ('Der 
Ring des Nibelungen'). You have to think that the character actually progresses 
much more than just in this opera -- though in this opera she really has to be 
seen to have a long way to go. She has to grow up considerably by the end." 
</P>
<P>
 This point of view, she said, has led to some friction with stage director 
Roberto Oswald. "I have to be careful here. . . . He and I haven't really got 
on. I think he had a problem with me from the start because he thought I was 
very young. I'm 33. Feb. 15 marks my 10th anniversary as a professional singer. 
In that time I think I've done something like 28 roles. I said to him, 'I think 
you think I'm very young and inexperienced. I'm actually neither.' But for me 
to say to him, 'This is what I think about her. . . . ' He's actually not 
interested in listening." 
</P>
<P>
 But she doesn't expect that "the production will be affected in the end 
(because) everyone is very good at his or her role and everyone's very 
professional and gets on with it and does the job." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eaglen was born in England to a family that, she said, "had nothing to do with 
music." Her father died of cancer when she was 10 and her mother had to start 
working to support the family. "It wasn't easy, certainly. It's a shame because 
I think I'm much more like him, in a way, than my mother. He had the kind of 
performing nature, and although the family was unmusical, completely, I think 
he'd much more understand what makes me want to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 She began studying voice at the University of Manchester with Joseph Ward, who 
has remained her sole teacher. "Until then, it had never really occurred to me 
that this was something you could do as a career -- or even that you could 
learn to sing. It's like people say to me even now, 'What do you mean, you have 
to train to be a singer? Can't you just sing, stand up and do it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, Ward predicted that someday the soprano would sing Brunnhilde and 
Norma. "So I started working. I sang things like (Norma's) 'Casta Diva' -- but 
without the top notes, which I didn't have -- because he said, 'This is what 
you'll do. You might as well start learning the style and the repertoire now.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 She made her professional debut as Lady Ella in Gilbert and Sullivan's 
"Patience" for the English National Opera. "Then I did a lot of First Ladies in 
'The Magic Flute' and Berthes in 'The Barber of Seville' and all sorts of 
things basically to get a bit of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea was to put me on contract so that financially I was secure and 
didn't have to sing the wrong things too soon. You know, the bills have got to 
be paid and sometimes you say, 'I have no choice, I have to do this even if 
it's the wrong thing to do.' It happens to so many people. But I was always 
very concerned that it shouldn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Her role models included Birgit Nilsson and Callas. "I think Nilsson is just 
the greatest voice, ever. I just love that exciting quality she had. And I 
think that basically Maria Callas was way up here and then opera singers are 
about down here. For the drama of it, Callas would be first every time. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it can be dangerous to listen to too many records," she added. "You just 
end up, without even consciously meaning to, doing an impression of them or 
copying what their phrasing is or whatever. I just prefer getting it from the 
score, really." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Callas, who eventually dropped the heavier repertory, Eaglen wants to 
continue singing it and the bel canto heroines. "I think in probably 10 years' 
time, I'll be quite happy to sing Isolde, Brunnhilde, Turandot -- and Norma. I 
hope I'll always keep that in there, just hope to keep the flexibility in the 
voice for as long as possible. And maybe a couple of others. Who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
 She doesn't expect the mix to hurt her voice. "My teacher always says, 
'Whichever part of the voice you look after properly, the rest of the voice 
will take care of itself anyway.' If you're singing anything badly, then the 
rest of the voice will suffer, too." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Isolde as a stage role has eluded her, although she did sing Isolde's 
Liebestod under Mauceri in July at the Hollywood Bowl. "I'm desperate to sing 
Isolde now," she said. "That's sort of on the horizon." 
</P>
<P>
 * Jane Eaglen will sing Brunnhilde in Wagner's "Die Walkure" for Opera Pacific 
at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa, 
Friday and March 10, 12 and 18 at 7 p.m. and March 20 at 2 p.m. $15 to $75. 
(714) 740-2000 (TicketMaster). CHANGES: Opera Pacific has postponed the 
premiere of "Un Camino de Fe" ("A Journey of Faith") from April to an 
unspecified date in October "to allow more time for artistic preparation," 
according to a prepared statement. The work, commissioned for young audiences, 
is being based on a story by Sagrario Gil, a 13-year-old student at Carr 
Intermediate School in Santa Ana. Hector Armienta is the composer. Timothy 
Kuster is the librettist.

THE 36TH ANNUAL GRAMMY AWARDS; FROM ELOQUENT TO EMBARRASSING: AN EVENING OF 
FIRSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were some nice awards and one swell music number after another, topped 
by jazz-singing Natalie Cole and a warm, moving tribute to Curtis Mayfield. 
There were some impressive statistics: two Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan jokes, 
two Lorena Bobbitt jokes, one Michael Jackson joke. In addition, nine winners 
thanked God, and Steven Tyler of Aerosmith asked God to bless rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything, though, Tuesday's Grammy Awards telecast on CBS -- beamed 
to the nation from Radio City Music Hall in New York -- was an evening of 
firsts. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time that truly memorable prose was lavished on a winner: the 
in-your-face, eloquent introduction of Frank Sinatra ("the chairman of bad") by 
cheroot-smoking rocker Bono of Grammy-winning U2. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also the first time that a Grammy Legend Award recipient was 
embarrassingly cut off in mid-sentence. The victim was, of all people, Sinatra, 
who had just broken a record for repeating he didn't know what to say, and 
appeared to be meandering, when he vanished like a blip from a radar screen. 
Seconds later, he reappeared in a long shot from the balcony, standing on stage 
in an apparent state of bewilderment as an off-camera voice announced earlier 
winners. 
</P>

 In addition, it was the first Grammy awards to be emceed by a critic. The 
hybrid host/critic, heading his fourth Grammy telecast, was Garry Shandling. 
Returning after the commercial break following Sinatra's crudely aborted 
acceptance "speech," Shandling (probably on orders from director Walter C. 
Miller or supervising producer John Cossette) said: "Mr. Sinatra should have 
(been allowed to finish) his speech. That was a slight mistake. This is live 
television." 
</P>
<P>
 That it was, in the East. Earlier, Shandling had chided that courageous rebel 
Bono for using a crude four-letter synonym in his own Grammy acceptance speech 
(CBS bleeped the word from the taped telecast seen on the West Coast). Bono had 
said that he wanted to deliver a message to the nation's youth: "We'll continue 
to abuse our position and (bleep) up the mainstream.' 
</P>
<P>
 Always thinking of the kids -- that's great. 
</P>
<P>
 Shandling also mocked Aerosmith's Tyler for saying that he loved rock 'n' roll 
"because it gets me off." And he targeted nominated rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg and 
the misogynistic tone of some rap: "His 'Doggy Style' is a very romantic album 
to play with your bitch." 
</P>
<P>
 One person whom Shandling didn't criticize was Shandling, even though he 
nervously stumbled and bumbled through the telecast's opening minutes, as if 
he'd never done this before. Actually he had -- on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 For, in another first, Shandling became the only awards show host to use 
material on such a major telecast that he had tried out just the night before 
on national television. Incredibly, he sprinkled the Tuesday telecast with 
jokes he told the previous evening on David Letterman's late-night show. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice helped. He told them better Tuesday night, and at least he was 
keeping it on the same network. 
</P>
<P>
 The final first was a camera shot of Donald and Marla Trump in the audience, 
responding tepidly to a performance on stage by the nominated jazz/hip-hop 
group Digable Planets. From their expressions, you'd have thought they were 
watching the Martian String Quartet.

THE 36TH ANNUAL GRAMMY AWARDS; COUNTRY; THE OUTLAWS ARE IN AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Grammy voters gave a nod, however hesitant, toward the progressive camp of 
country with the top awards. In fact, in the wake of the honors heaped on the 
"Aladdin" soundtrack in major pop categories, the country results seemed almost 
radical. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-styled rebel Dwight Yoakam upset favorites Alan Jackson and Garth Brooks 
in the male vocal category, winning his first Grammy for "Ain't That Lonely 
Yet." 
</P>
<P>
 And to the musical question "Shouldn't I have all of this?" Grammy voters 
soundly answered yes to singer Mary-Chapin Carpenter and songwriter Lucinda 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Passionate Kisses," a bittersweet plea for everlasting romance and "pens that 
don't run out of ink," won Grammys for Williams and Carpenter as song of the 
year and female vocal of the year, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a long shot in the songwriters' competition, is a nouveau folkie and 
Nashville outsider compared to such well-established nominees as Kostas ("Ain't 
That Lonely Yet") and Alan Jackson ("Chattahoochee"). 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Yoakam's music reflects his strong ties to the roots-rock community, 
and Carpenter came to country via folk-rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Were the vote for "Passionate Kisses" strictly a reflection of Grammy's 
traditional love of a winner -- Carpenter has won the female vocal category 
three years straight now -- the song award might as easily have been given to 
Carpenter's own nominated composition, "The Hard Way." 
</P>
<P>
 Voting in other major country categories was less adventuresome, with Brooks & 
Dunn getting the nod for duo or group vocal for their predictable, 
lick-the-hand-that-feeds hit "Hard Workin' Man." And Reba McEntire won her 
second Grammy -- her first came in 1986 -- for her vocal collaboration with 
Linda Davis on "Does He Love You." RANDY LEWIS

THE 36TH ANNUAL GRAMMY AWARDS; CLASSICAL; DUAL AWARDS FOR CHICAGO SYMPHONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nominated in two separate classical categories, the Chicago Symphony won both 
with performances of sometimes neglected works by Bela Bartok. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebrated Chicago ensemble won for best classical album with its 
performance of both "The Wooden Prince" and "Cantata Profana," in conjunction 
with the Chicago Symphony Chorus. This recording also was named best orchestral 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that the already-much-Grammyed Chicago orchestra did this not 
under its former music director, Sir Georg Solti, nor its current Symphony Hall 
czar, Daniel Barenboim, but under the exigent French conductor, Pierre Boulez. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in the year in which she steps down as director of the Chicago Symphony 
Chorus, it seemed fitting that Margaret Hillis should be recognized with 
another Grammy for best performance of a choral work ("Cantata Profana"). 
</P>
<P>
 Recognition came also to veteran American pianist John Browning, who took a 
Grammy at age 60 for his complete solo piano works of the late Samuel Barber; 
and, posthumously, to American soprano Arleen Auger, who died in June, for "The 
Art of Arleen Auger," made with pianist Joel Revzen. 
</P>
<P>
 For best opera recording, the voters passed over John Adams' recent "Death of 
Klinghoffer," and works by Britten, Prokofiev and Gluck, in favor of Handel's 
250-year-old "Semele," conducted by John Nelson, with an American cast headed 
by Kathleen Battle, Marilyn Horne and Samuel Ramey. 
</P>
<P>
 German violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, this season on maternity leave, won the 
category instrumental soloist with orchestra, playing two 20th-Century works, 
the Berg Concerto and Wolfgang Rihm's "Time Chant," with the Chicago Symphony, 
conducted by James Levine. 
</P>
<P>
 Beating out noble competition from his colleagues -- William Bolcom, Donald 
Erb, Toru Takemitsu and Michael Tippett -- American octogenarian Elliott Carter 
took the award for best contemporary composition for his violin concerto, as 
played by soloist Ole Bohn, with the London Sinfonietta, conducted by Oliver 
Knussen. DANIEL CARIAGA

THE 36TH ANNUAL GRAMMY AWARDS; R&B; R&B BLUNDERS BUT WORTHY RAP VICTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the winners in the R&B categories -- Ray Charles, Toni Braxton, Sade and 
Janet Jackson -- are really representative of the genre's best, R&B is in deep 
trouble. And if the voters didn't bungle the rap voting, it was largely because 
they couldn't -- with that list of quality nominees, a blindfolded vote would 
have yielded a worthy winner. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, Grammy voters chose to honor a distinguished veteran, in this case 
Ray Charles. But "A Song for You" isn't remotely as good as the work he did 
back when he truly was the genius of soul music. More deserving contemporary 
artists, notably Tevin Campbell and Babyface, are also-rans again. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the female vocal category, the voters blundered by going for the 
newcomer. Braxton's bland "Another Sad Love Song" is far from this category's 
best performance. In fact, it's not even the best song on her own debut album. 
In this case the veteran -- Aretha Franklin for "Someday We'll All Be Free" -- 
was far and away the best choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Sade's triumph in the R&B vocal category doesn't make sense either. The 
lightweight "No Ordinary Love" was the worst of a feeble field of candidates. 
The only quality song in the bunch, Tony Toni Tone's "Anniversary," was also 
much more deserving of best R&B song than the winner, Janet Jackson's routine 
"That's the Way Love Goes." 
</P>
<P>
 The academy does deserve a pat on the back for nominating so many quality 
songs in the rap categories. Can anyone honestly quarrel with the winners -- 
Digable Planets for group effort, and Dr. Dre, who picked up the solo award? 
</P>
<P>
 Amazingly, the normally conservative academy members didn't overload the rap 
categories with pop-oriented rap. Maybe the quality of that more-wholesome 
genre has fallen so far off that they were forced to recognize such notorious 
rappers as Dre, Snoop Doggy Dogg and Cypress Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggestion for next year: how about more than two rap categories? DENNIS HUNT

THE 36TH ANNUAL GRAMMY AWARDS; JAZZ; GIANTS LIVING AND DEAD CITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Henderson and Miles Davis were the big winners in this year's jazz Grammy 
selections. 
</P>
<P>
 After laboring for years in relative anonymity as a "musician's musician," 
Henderson, 57, added awards for best instrumental jazz solo and best jazz 
instrumental performance by an individual or group to his initial Grammy in 
1992. Davis, who died in 1991, was represented -- directly and indirectly -- in 
three of the five jazz awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The richly deserved solo award for "Miles Ahead" and album award for "So Near, 
So Far (Musings for Miles)" confirmed the rapidly emerging view of Henderson as 
one of the two or three finest living jazz tenor saxophonists. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis was, of course, the subject of the winning Henderson tribute album. He 
also won (with Quincy Jones) in the recording academy's most archaic category, 
the best large jazz ensemble performance, for "Miles and Quincy Live at 
Montreux," hardly up to classic Davis levels, yet undeniably significant as his 
last major performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Metheny repeated in the best contemporary jazz performance (instrumental) 
with "The Road to You," an album that expands the envelope of contemporary 
jazz, and a more impressive victory than last year's win because of powerful 
competition from Chick Corea, John Patitucci, the Yellowjackets and Fourplay. 
</P>
<P>
 In a category that seems to see many of the same names every year, Natalie 
Cole won her seventh Grammy with a pop-oriented vocal outing, as the academy 
chose to ignore a rare nomination for the talented and too often overlooked 
Ernestine Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, only one of the jazz Grammys was awarded on camera, and Cole's brisk, 
swing-style reading of "It's Sand, Man" and a brief fluegelhorn solo by Clark 
Terry with Digable Planets were the only jazz performances -- a reflection of 
the academy's continuing cavalier treatment of the music. 
</P>
<P>
 But jazz talent of varying degrees managed to sneak into other categories, 
with wins by Kenny G for best instrumental composition with "Forever in Love," 
Dave Grusin for best arrangement on an instrumental with "Mood Indigo," and 
"The Complete Billie Holiday on Verve 1945-1959" as best historical album. DON 
HECKMAN

TV RATINGS; AMAZING FACTS! AMAZING MOOLA! (AT LEAST FOR CBS)

 The concluding week of the Winter Olympics registered another set of TV 
records. With the release of the A.C. Nielsen figures Tuesday, CBS noted these 
amazing facts: 
</P>
<P>
 * CBS' weekly prime-time average of 30.5 was higher than the total of all 
three other networks combined -- the first time that feat has been achieved. 
With Greg Gumbel anchoring, it was the highest weekly ratings average in CBS' 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 * CBS won all seven nights and all 44 half-hours of prime time, as it did the 
week before. No network had managed that since ABC's coverage of the 1984 
Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 * Last Wednesday's coverage, which included the first performances of the 
much-anticipated women's figure skater competition, was the sixth highest-rated 
broadcast of all time (48.5) and the highest-rated Olympics telecast ever. CBS 
estimated that more than 126.6 million U.S. viewers watched at least part of 
the prime-time program. And Friday's coverage of the women's figure skating 
finals drew an estimated 119.9 million, the network said, making it the 
highest-rated Friday in history. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Olympic tune-in also helped the "CBS Evening News," which beat its ABC 
and NBC rivals for the first time since August of 1992. Southland Ratings 
</P>
<P>
 Here are A.C. Nielsen's Top 10 prime-time programs in the Los Angeles area

PERFORMANCE REVIEW; A WELL-VERSED FOURSOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEVINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's ironic that the man who wrote "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" 
would headline the "Free Your Mind Spoken Word Tour" -- a road show sponsored 
by television force MTV. Nevertheless, Gil Scott-Heron's politicized urban 
poetry fit in well at the Troubadour on Monday, in a four-artist show that 
emphasized the performance of verse as well as its content. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing a keyboard and backed by a percussionist, Scott-Heron -- an 
influential veteran whose '70s records were a precursor of rap -- sang rather 
than spoke for almost all of his set. Purists might gripe that this set-up was 
hardly the essence of spoken word, but it was hard to argue with the poignancy 
his playing brought to such songs as "Winter in America," or with the soulful 
groove he created. 
</P>
<P>
 The influence of rap on the spoken word genre was especially apparent during a 
powerful set by New York-based poet Reg E. Gaines, who used hip-hop's style and 
urgency to perform pieces about issues such as urban violence.  
</P>
<P>
 Leading a three-piece band and prowling around the stage with the energy of a 
punk rocker, Maggie Estep -- one of the most high-profile figures on the 
poetry-reading scene -- spoke, sang and screamed poems that combined the 
personal and the political with a cynical, razor-sharp wit. 
</P>
<P>
 John S. Hall, singer for the alternative rock band King Missile, performed his 
work more traditionally, using backing drums on only two numbers. He read 
absurdist short pieces as well as lyrics to King Missile songs in a deadpan 
tone that made his dark humor all the more affecting. ROBERT LEVINE
