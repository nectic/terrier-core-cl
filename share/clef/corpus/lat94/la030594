4 FOUND GUILTY IN PLOT TO BOMB N.Y. TRADE CENTER; TERRORISM: MUSLIM EXTREMISTS 
ARE CONVICTED A YEAR AFTER THE BLAST THAT KILLED SIX AND INJURED 1,000. VERDICT

<P>
 A federal jury on Friday found four militant Muslims guilty of conspiring to 
bomb the World Trade Center in what prosecutors called the worst terrorist 
attack in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury convicted the defendants on conspiracy, assault and various 
explosives charges after a five-month trial during which 207 witnesses 
testified and 1,003 exhibits were presented -- re-creating the horror of the 
explosion on Feb. 26, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The blast that filled the 110-story twin towers with smoke and flames on that 
snowy Friday afternoon killed six people and injured more than 1,000 others. It 
also shattered America's sense of post-Cold War invulnerability, the belief 
that terrorism was an overseas phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 All four defendants could receive life in prison without parole when they are 
sentenced on May 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Turmoil erupted in the third-floor courtroom when the verdicts were announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Injustice! Victim!" shouted Mohammed A. Salameh, the chief defendant in the 
case, which was based overwhelmingly on circumstantial evidence. "God is 
great!" his three companions called out in defiance, pounding on the defense 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 The brother of one of the men was held in contempt for joining in the 
outburst. U.S. District Judge Kevin Duffy later said that he believed the 
disturbance was a deliberate attempt to influence the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "This verdict should send a clear and unmistakable message that we will not 
tolerate terrorism in this country," U.S. Atty. Mary Jo White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the verdicts, which were reached during the fifth day of 
deliberations, President Clinton said in Washington: "I am very gratified by 
the work that was done. The signal should go out across the world that anyone 
who seeks to come to this country to practice terrorism will have the full 
weight of law enforcement authorities against them." 
</P>
<P>
 And the State Department warned Americans of possible attacks by Islamic 
extremists, particularly in Egypt, in retaliation for the verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the trade center defendants are followers of Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman, a 
Muslim cleric and opponent of Egypt's government. He is imprisoned in a nearby 
federal jail, awaiting trial later this year on charges that he was involved in 
a plot to bomb the United Nations and three other prominent New York City 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
 The anonymous jury Friday found Salameh, Nidal Ayyad, Mahmud Abouhalima and 
Ahmad Mohammad Ajaj guilty of conspiring to detonate a bomb in the garage 
beneath the trade center, causing widespread injuries, loss of life and 
millions of dollars in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, a mysterious Iraqi who fled the New York area hours after 
the explosion, was indicted as a fugitive and is still at large. Investigators 
believe he is the ringleader of the alleged plot and is the subject of an 
international manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
 White said that "considerable efforts" are being made to apprehend him. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for some of the defendants said that they would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert E. Precht, Salameh's attorney, charged that pretrial leaks by the 
government had sought to "demonize" his client. "No one in government should be 
patting themselves on the back and pretending this was a fair outcome." Like 
other defense lawyers in the case, Precht spoke from behind wooden police 
barriers outside the federal courthouse in Manhattan's Foley Square, where 
security was extraordinarily tight. When the verdicts were announced, the 
entire front of the courthouse was sealed off and large contingents of federal 
guards and New York police officers stood at the ready. But there were no 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, prosecutors charged that Salameh, 26, a Palestinian 
immigrant, had helped provide the money for the chemicals used to manufacture 
the bomb, helped build the explosive device, rented the shed in New Jersey 
where bomb components were stored and rented an apartment that also became a 
bomb factory. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors further charged that Salameh rented the yellow van that carried 
the bomb to the trade center's garage and that he was seen in the van only 
hours before the explosive was detonated. 
</P>
<P>
 Government lawyers showed that Ayyad, a 26-year-old chemical engineer, ordered 
bomb components, including hydrogen gas tanks used in the explosive. Telephone 
records introduced during the trial showed scores of phone calls from Ayyad to 
the bomb factory and storage shed. Ayyad also provided the car that Salameh 
used to stake out the World Trade Center, prosecutors told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence showed that Abouhalima, 34, bought smokeless powder for the bomb and 
was seen frequently at the bomb factory while the device was being assembled. 
Evidence also was introduced that Abouhalima was seen only hours before the 
bombing by a gas station attendant in a car accompanying the van that carried 
the explosive. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors charged that Ajaj, 28, was trained in explosives before he tried 
to enter the United States with a fake passport. Bombmaking manuals were found 
in his luggage, and he called the bomb factory from jail several times while 
the device was being assembled. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Attorneys Gilmore Childers and Henry DePippo spent 18 weeks 
outlining their case to the jury in such painstaking fashion that even Duffy, 
outside the presence of the jury, urged them repeatedly to step up the pace.  
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutors, for example, spent weeks introducing pieces of debris found 
in the five-story-deep underground crater left by the 1,200-pound bomb. One was 
a charred hunk of chassis bearing an identification number showing the vehicle 
that carried the bomb was a Ryder van that had been rented by Salameh. 
</P>
<P>
 Another jagged metal piece bore the initials "AGL." The government put on 
witnesses to identify it as part of a tank of hydrogen gas that AGL Welding 
Inc. delivered to a New Jersey storage locker rented by some of the defendants. 
Hydrogen gas can greatly increase the destructive force of a homemade bomb, 
experts testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from physical evidence found at the bomb site, the government's case 
focused largely on the storage locker where Salameh and Abouhalima were seen as 
frequent visitors. Prosecutors showed that a variety of chemicals were stored 
at the Jersey City locker even before the hydrogen tanks were delivered there. 
</P>
<P>
 The government said that the bomb was made in a nearby apartment shared by 
Salameh and Yousef, who is believed to be overseas.  
</P>
<P>
 Experts said that the walls and carpeting of the apartment were stained with 
chemical residues. Prosecutors also introduced a pair of acid-stained shoes 
belonging to Abouhalima, who flew to Egypt shortly after the bombing but was 
seized by security police there and turned over to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 In searching Abouhalima's New Jersey home, the FBI also found a receipt for a 
refrigerator that was used to store nitroglycerin for the bombing.  
</P>
<P>
 Other evidence showed that Salameh and Ayyad opened a joint bank account with 
$8,500 and later withdrew a large cash sum, using 36 $100 bills to purchase a 
supply of chemicals.  
</P>
<P>
 Ayyad also was linked to an anonymous letter sent to the New York Times 
threatening further acts of violence unless the United States cut off all 
assistance to Israel. Computer disks found in his office bore the same phrases, 
and saliva tests on the envelope flap matched samples from Ayyad.  
</P>
<P>
 Records subpoenaed from telephone companies showed Salameh, Abouhalima and 
Ayyad were constantly in touch through more than 100 calls in the weeks 
preceding the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ajaj had been in jail for six months on immigration violations at the time of 
the explosion. But the government said that he was linked to the bomb plot 
through bomb-making manuals and terrorist training videos that he had brought 
into the country.  
</P>
<P>
 Trial evidence showed that Ajaj and Yousef had arrived on the same flight from 
Pakistan on Sept. 1, 1992. Prosecutors said Ajaj was stopped because of a false 
Swedish passport, but Yousef slipped into the country on his Iraqi passport. 
Yousef's fingerprints later were found on some of Ajaj's bomb manuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the prosecution called more than 200 witnesses, none of the 
defendants took the witness stand on their own behalf, and only one -- Ajaj -- 
put on any witnesses. Instead, defense lawyers stressed to the jury that there 
were no eyewitnesses who saw anyone make a bomb or drive explosives into the 
trade center's garage, asserting there were "reasonable doubts" about the 
culpability of their clients.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, they noted that one prosecution witness -- gas station attendant 
Willie Hernandez Moosh -- had mistakenly identified two members of the jury 
rather than two of the defendants as the men he saw driving a yellow Ryder van 
in New Jersey the morning of the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Precht, Salameh's lawyer, described his client as "a struggling immigrant" who 
was unwittingly involved in the plot only because he was duped by the fugitive 
Yousef, whom Precht said was a professional terrorist with apparent financial 
backing from Iraq.  
</P>
<P>
 "Salameh did not know his activities were intended to further a conspiracy to 
destroy buildings in the United States," Precht said.  
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that Salameh had rented the van that was used in the bombing 
but that he intended to use it to move some of his belongings.  
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, prosecutors did not attempt to pinpoint the source of the 
funds that they said were used by Salameh and Ayyad to purchase chemicals. 
Authorities learned that the money had been wired from a bank in Germany but 
could not trace it further. 
</P>
<P>
 Atiq Ahmed, the lawyer representing Ayyad, said that his client only bought 
chemicals in the mistaken belief that he was helping friends start a chemical 
export business.  
</P>
<P>
 Ajaj's defense attorney, Austin Campriello, called a witness to testify that 
the literature on bombs that was in his client's possession was legal and could 
be obtained in public libraries. Campriello said that the terrorist-training 
videos Ajaj had were related to his support for Muslin rebels in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
 Still awaiting trial next fall are a group of 15 alleged conspirators, headed 
by Abdul Rahman, who are charged with helping to plan not only the trade center 
explosion but also the destruction of United Nations headquarters and the 
Lincoln and Holland commuter tunnels linking New York with New Jersey. All have 
pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of the guilty verdicts Friday on that case was uncertain. 
Prosecutors were asked whether the jury's decision might persuade some of the 
defendants in the larger trial to seek plea bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can happen," White replied, smiling. But the prosecutor stressed that the 
larger trial was a separate issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am glad the criminal justice system has acted decisively," said Stanley 
Brezenoff, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, 
the agency that operates the trade center. The Bombers and Their Roles 
</P>
<P>
 Sentencing for the four defendants is set for May 4. Though the main charge of 
conspiracy carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, other related 
charges could send the men to prison for life with parole. THE DEFENDANTS

COMIC ACTOR JOHN CANDY DIES AT MEXICO FILMING SITE; ENTERTAINMENT: STAR OF 
'SCTV' AND 'PLANES, TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES' WAS 43. HE REPORTEDLY SUFFERED A 
HEART ATTACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Candy, the hefty comic who rose to fame in a series of slapstick films 
that brought smiles to the faces of studio financiers and shrieks of delight 
from his audiences, died Friday in Mexico, where he was filming. 
</P>
<P>
 The star of "Uncle Buck," "Planes, Trains & Automobiles," "Stripes" and many 
other films was 43. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Partida, a spokesman for the government of Durango state, 400 miles 
northwest of Mexico City, said Candy was stricken in his sleep and was found 
dead in his trailer when paramedics arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened very quickly; it was a massive heart attack," Partida said. "Even 
the first-aid crew, when they got there, found him dead." 
</P>
<P>
 The production of "Wagons East," in which Candy was playing the drunken wagon 
master of an 1860s prairie schooner heading the wrong way, was suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-3, 300-pound TV and movie veteran had won two Emmys. In addition to 
battling a weight problem most of his life, Candy was reported to be a heavy 
smoker. 
</P>
<P>
 At his death, Candy was diversifying his multitude of talents and most 
recently completed the Fox television movie comedy, "Hostage for a Day," his 
directorial debut. 
</P>
<P>
 He was trying, friends said, to move beyond the knockabout, satiric style that 
had first endeared him to TV and then movie audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 In the film "Only the Lonely," he had assumed a more serious role as a Chicago 
policeman who falls in love and must choose between his girlfriend and breaking 
a mother's bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I have the ability and I'd like to exercise that and stretch, if you 
will, to take other roles on," Candy said in a 1991 interview. 
</P>
<P>
 But his death probably will limit an assessment of his career to those early 
pictures in which he fumbled, stumbled and usually fell while trying in vain to 
be of some use to somebody. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrote Mike McGrady of New York Newsday in 1986: 
</P>
<P>
 "Sincere, intense, well-intentioned, naive, he is constantly digging and 
redigging his own grave. His appeal is phenomenal.  
</P>
<P>
 "He has been in more turkeys than stuffing mix, yet everyone seems to love 
him. . . . Given a role with meat to it . . . John Candy reveals himself to be 
an accomplished comic actor." 
</P>
<P>
 The shy, genial actor and writer, who was legendary for his spontaneous wit 
and ability as a teller of tales, until recently had avoided interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 He attributed that in part to still being self-conscious despite his fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a real heavy kid," he said in an interview with The Times three years 
ago. "I didn't go out on a lot of dates; Saturday nights I stayed home and 
watched Carol Burnett with my parents." 
</P>
<P>
 An only child who entertained himself with comic books and horror films, Candy 
said he completely understood the angst felt by Danny Muldoon, the policeman in 
"Only the Lonely," as he fought to untie the apron strings his mother had 
knotted about him. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, he said, a much more difficult challenge than if the roles had 
involved lovers rather than loving combatants. 
</P>
<P>
 Candy's last big hit was 1993's "Cool Runnings," about the Jamaican bobsled 
team. Before that he had been in the 1990 blockbuster, "Home Alone," which set 
box-office records. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many stars who surround themselves with a retinue of loyalists while 
making pictures, Candy was known to mingle freely with his co-workers, from 
grips to carpenters to fellow actors. 
</P>
<P>
 He sometimes gave each of the women working on his pictures roses on 
Valentine's Day or remembered his crew with candy or small gifts at other 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 John Franklin Candy was born in Toronto. His father died a few years after his 
birth on Oct. 31, 1950, and he was raised by his mother, his aunt and his 
grandparents. He attended Roman Catholic schools and competed in football and 
hockey, but admitted to not being particularly skillful in either sport. 
</P>
<P>
 He remained interested in athletics, and after gaining wealth as an 
entertainer, he became a co-owner of the Canadian Football League's Toronto 
Argonauts with Los Angeles Kings owner Bruce McNall and Kings star Wayne 
Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 As a boy he was fascinated with films, particularly those of George Burns and 
Gracie Allen, Abbott and Costello, and the Three Stooges. "Lassie" and "Howdy 
Doody" were among his childhood TV favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 He gravitated toward acting and began to appear in local stage productions 
while studying journalism and theater at Centennial College in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked at odd jobs, selling sporting goods and paper supplies while 
dabbling in children's stage productions and underground theater. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971 he met another struggling Canadian actor -- Dan Aykroyd -- who was 
sorting mail for the Canadian postal service. At Aykroyd's urging he auditioned 
for the Chicago Second City troupe, where the future stars of "Saturday Night 
Live" were hanging out. 
</P>
<P>
 With John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Bill Murray and Aykroyd he established the 
ties that would lead to SCTV (Second City Television) in Toronto, and their 
half-hour skits were soon picked up in syndication by NBC and sent to 45 
American cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The network expanded the program to 90 minutes in 1981 and put it on the air 
after "The Tonight Show With Johnny Carson." 
</P>
<P>
 Candy acted and wrote for "SCTV Network," and won writing Emmys in 1981 and 
1982. The show was a deliciously biting lampoon of everything on commercial TV, 
including such icons as Perry Como. 
</P>
<P>
 Among its lasting contributions to American counterculture was "The Fracases, 
America's Nastiest Couple," and "The Great White North," a spoof of two 
Canadian brothers with red necks and a spectacularly limited view of the world 
around them. 
</P>
<P>
 Candy became famous for his impressions of Luciano Pavarotti and Julia Child 
and for his half-crazed characters: The chain-smoking egoist Johnny LaRue, the 
late-night horror show host Dr. Tongue, and one of the polka enthusiasts known 
as the Shmnenge Brothers Happy Wanderers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Individually the Second City TV performers were merely brilliant and 
inspired; as a group, they were visionary," said a Village Voice critic. 
</P>
<P>
 But the late-hour time slot crippled ratings and "SCTV" went off the air in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Candy said the show accomplished one thing: "We increased the sale of VCRs 
(because) nobody stayed up." 
</P>
<P>
 Discouraged, he left TV but not acting. 
</P>
<P>
 Film director Steven Spielberg had seen Candy earlier and gave him a small 
part in "1941," a comedy about the days after Pearl Harbor. Much of what he and 
Aykroyd did in the film was eliminated in the final cut, but he considered it 
his first major film break. Earlier he had appeared in several long-forgotten 
Canadian pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 His next major picture was "The Blues Brothers" in 1980 with Aykroyd and 
Belushi. He was parole officer Burton Mercer, constantly and hilariously 
frustrated in his pursuit of Jake and Elwood Blues. 
</P>
<P>
 Next he had a small part in the Army comedy "Stripes," playing opposite 
another SCTV veteran, Murray. 
</P>
<P>
 After a series devoted to the worst movies ever made ("It Came From 
Hollywood"), Candy made "National Lampoon's Vacation" and "Going Berserk." 
</P>
<P>
 In the latter film he portrayed the fiance of a congressman's daughter who is 
brainwashed and tries to assassinate his future father-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Loved him, hated it," was the critical reaction, particularly in Variety, 
which found Candy "irresistible." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984 he played Freddie Bauer, the lovable lecher in "Splash." The 
Washington Post said that role, supporting Tom Hanks, "should establish Candy 
as an audience favorite." And it did. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he continued to make films that caused critics to moan ("Brewster's 
Millions" and "Summer Rental"), he was becoming more than a cult favorite while 
establishing the inept good-guy image that marked his oeuvre.  
</P>
<P>
 "Armed and Dangerous" in 1986 failed commercially and critically but 
"Volunteers," about the misadventures of some Peace Corps members, succeeded 
artistically if not commercially. 
</P>
<P>
 With "Planes, Trains & Automobiles" in 1987, Candy emerged as a major star. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Steve Martin portrayed two disparate and desperate travelers trying to 
get home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Candy has never been more boisterously cracked than he is here," said the 
Post. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Martin on learning of his colleague's death: 
</P>
<P>
 "John Candy was a gentleman and a great comic talent. I count myself extremely 
lucky to have had the opportunity to work with him." 
</P>
<P>
 While initially appealing to sophisticated insomniacs on television, Candy's 
glory became such that by 1989 he was able to sustain a show while being heard 
but not seen as the chief counselor at "Camp Candy," a Saturday morning 
animated children's TV show. There he battled the evil Rex de Forrest, who 
wanted to tear down the camp and replace it with condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 He interspersed film appearances with TV specials. He was host of "Jackie 
Gleason, the Great One" and "Best of SCTV," among others. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, Candy lived a quiet life with his wife, Rosemary, and two children 
in homes in Toronto and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He also had made his peace with studio executives, many of whom considered him 
a jolly fat man and had placed him in many inferior films. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago he recalled how disappointed he was with the film work that 
followed the brilliant, biting years of "SCTV." 
</P>
<P>
 "My agent is always telling me, 'It's not called show art, it's show 
business,' and I have to learn that until the money comes out of your pockets, 
you can rant and rave all you want, but they hold the purse strings." 
</P>
<P>
 Cable TV's "Comedy Central" has scheduled a special tribute to Candy for 
Saturday evening.

JOB FIGURES SHOW GAINS FOR CALIFORNIA, U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In a sign that California may be pulling out of its long and punishing 
recession, the federal government reported Friday that the state gained 9,500 
jobs last month and its unemployment rate fell to 9%, down from 10.1% in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's improvement accompanied a strong performance nationally that cut 
the U.S. unemployment rate to 6.5%, from 6.7% the month before, and added 
217,000 jobs to employer payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
 While economists downplayed the significance of the declines in the 
unemployment rates -- particularly the often-volatile state and local figures 
-- they were heartened by the signs of job growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were seeing the job total go down month after month, and now it seems to 
be leveling off," in the state, said Ted Gibson, principal economist for the 
California Department of Finance in Sacramento. "There are grounds for 
encouragement here, especially since February should have had the most negative 
effects from the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 "The preliminary sense is . . . we (in California) may be out of recession and 
that it is happening six months sooner than we had expected back in December," 
said Larry Kimbell, director of the UCLA Business Forecasting Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimbell said he now expects California to enjoy modest gains in employment 
this year, reversing a severe decline since mid-1990 that, by some estimates, 
cost the state more than 800,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The jobless report for Los Angeles County was also encouraging, with 
unemployment dipping to 9.7%, down from 11% a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet analysts cautioned that state and local jobless rates swing widely because 
they are drawn from relatively small numbers of household interviews. In 
addition, federal officials said some of the recent fluctuations may stem from 
new information-gathering techniques they adopted this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, economists focused on the government's separate survey of 
employer payrolls, which showed the gain of 9,500 jobs in California and 
217,000 nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's employment increase nationally marked a sharp improvement from 
frigid January, when weather-related problems led to a 2,000-job decline. 
</P>
<P>
 But the increase in jobs in February, which outstripped the pace of employment 
growth for 1993, came even though "the impact of this winter's severe weather 
was still apparent in several industries," Katherine G. Abraham, U.S. 
commissioner of labor statistics, told a hearing of Congress' Joint Economic 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction, retailing and restaurants all were hampered as bad weather kept 
workers and consumers at home, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The general business outlook for the United States appears strong, with the 
Commerce Department reporting Friday that the government's main forecasting 
gauge rose 0.3% in January, the sixth straight monthly increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The gauge, known as the index of leading indicators, includes measures such as 
industrial orders and points to the overall economy's likely performance in the 
next four to six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists said the rebounding national economy may be starting to pull 
California along with it. At the same time, they said, the job losses from 
earthquake-related business closings in February were less than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, analysts said they expect Southern California to enjoy a major 
pickup in construction in coming months as rebuilding efforts get into full 
swing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's already in the bank that this will be a good year for construction," 
Kimbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the national employment figures were welcome, Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes 
(D-Md.), chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, said: "I don't think they 
should be misread as signs that the economy is booming or as a threat of 
impending inflation." 
</P>
<P>
 Job creation has averaged 146,000 a month during the first 13 months of the 
Clinton Administration, keeping on schedule with the White House's goal of 
generating 8 million jobs during the President's term. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the production of new jobs remains modest compared with the growth in 
the output of goods and services: The economy expanded at an annual rate of 
7.5% during the final quarter of last year. This was not accompanied by a vast 
expansion of jobs because many companies are benefiting from productivity 
improvements or are choosing to increase overtime hours rather than hire 
additional workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The easiest thing to do is to pay overtime to your current labor force," said 
Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), a member of the Joint Economic 
Committee. "Hiring a new worker means a large fixed overhead, with significant 
fringe benefit costs." 
</P>
<P>
 While the average workweek in manufacturing, which had been running at 
near-record levels, dropped last month, the decline was attributed to bad 
weather by Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of the President's Council of 
Economic Advisers.  
</P>
<P>
 "As Mother Nature proves to be a little nicer to us in March, the economy 
could return to a more normal pattern," Tyson told reporters at a White House 
news briefing.  
</P>
<P>
 Tyson also offered reassuring words for investors worried about erratic bond 
prices and uncertain financial markets. Inflation won't be a menace, she 
insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we look at the fundamentals, we remain absolutely comfortable with the 
forecast we have out there in terms of (economic) growth in the range of 3% 
this year and inflation in the range of 3% this year," she said. "That is our 
forecast, and we remain totally comfortable with it." 
</P>
<P>
 February was the second month in which the government has used its new survey 
for measuring unemployment, including a more accurate count of women in the 
work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the old system, the jobless rate would have been calculated at 6.4% in 
December, 6.3% in January and 6.4% last month. Under the new system, the 
figures were 7% in December, followed by the 6.7% rate in January and 6.5% last 
month.

WHITE HOUSE AIDES GET WHITEWATER SUBPOENAS; PROBE: THE FOCUS IS ON NINE 
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS. PRESIDENTIAL COUNSEL NUSSBAUM'S RESIGNATION SEEN 
NEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whitewater special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. on Friday subpoenaed nine 
Clinton Administration officials, including White House Counsel Bernard 
Nussbaum, whose resignation is considered imminent because of the way he has 
handled the Whitewater controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Those subpoenaed include six White House aides who participated in meetings 
with Treasury Department officials about aspects of the investigation into the 
Whitewater Development Corp., an Ozark Mountain real estate venture in which 
then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, were 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske had been expected to subpoena Administration officials as part of his 
effort to determine what happened in the Whitewater matter, but his decision to 
summon those involved in the White House-Treasury Department meetings makes it 
clear that he also intends to examine subsequent related actions to see if any 
improprieties occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Subpoenaed were Nussbaum, White House counselor Bruce Lindsey; Deputy Chief of 
Staff Harold Ickes; Communications Director Mark D. Gearan; Hillary Clinton's 
chief of staff, Margaret Williams; and the First Lady's press secretary, Lisa 
Caputo. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey has been the chief White House official handling Whitewater-related 
questions for Clinton. Ickes, Williams and Nussbaum met last month with Deputy 
Treasury Secretary Roger Altman, who briefed them on procedures that the 
Resolution Trust Corp. -- a Treasury agency -- was following in pursuing its 
investigation of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, a failed Arkansas thrift that 
was owned by James B. McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the real estate deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Gearan and Nussbaum took part in a meeting last fall with Treasury Department 
officials at which the Madison Guaranty investigation was discussed. 
Participants have said that they discussed only one topic at the meeting: how 
to respond to press inquiries about Madison Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske also subpoenaed Altman and two other Treasury Department officials who 
participated in the meetings -- General Counsel Jean E. Hanson and Joshua 
Steiner, the department's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum has been under fire for allowing the meetings to take place and for 
participating in them. Congressional Republicans and other critics have charged 
that the meetings could have allowed White House officials to interfere with 
the Treasury Department's investigation of possible wrongdoing at Madison 
Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton conceded Thursday that the meetings, two last fall and one 
last month, created an appearance of impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske is investigating the Clintons' role in Whitewater Development and, among 
other things, whether funds from Madison Guaranty might have been used to pay 
off Clinton campaign debts or to offset their losses on the real estate 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons have said that they lost about $69,000 in Whitewater. Madison 
Guaranty was seized by federal regulators in 1989 at a cost to taxpayers of 
between $47 million and $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memorandum to the White House staff, Deputy Counsel Joel Klein said that 
the subpoenas, which call for the officials to appear in federal district court 
in Washington on March 10, cover "any and all documents and/or communications 
referring or relating to any contacts, meetings or conversations about or 
regarding Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, its subsidiaries or affiliates" 
between White House staff and officials of the Treasury Department or the RTC. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein warned that "the destruction of documents after receipt of this subpoena 
may constitute obstruction of justice" and suggested that, "if you have any 
doubt about whether a particular document is called for . . , you must save 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Klein also directed White House aides not to purge any computer records and 
directed officials to stop removing any paper from the White House, including 
trash thrown in wastebaskets. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said staff members would fully 
comply with the subpoenas and that the White House would have no other comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was informed of the subpoenas about 7 p.m. Friday, shortly before they 
were served, aides said, and he instructed the staff to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 The subpoenas, the first known to have been issued to White House officials in 
the investigation, could temporarily delay the resignation of Nussbaum, whose 
yearlong tenure as the White House chief counsel has been marked by frequent 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Clinton conspicuously distanced himself from his embattled 
aide at a White House press conference, ducking several public opportunities to 
voice confidence in him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nothing more to add to what I said yesterday," Clinton said when asked 
about Nussbaum. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's reference was to remarks he made Thursday criticizing the meetings 
Nussbaum attended with Treasury Department officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to be careful," Clinton said at the press conference. "I think I have 
sent a very clear and unambiguous signal that there's no point in letting a 
process mess this White House up when we have not yet been accused of any 
wrongdoing. And since there was no wrongdoing on my part, I want a full, 
complete, thorough investigation, and I want it to go forward unimpeded and 
then to be over." 
</P>
<P>
 While Clinton did not mention Nussbaum by name, his words appeared to be a 
clear rebuke, given that Nussbaum's job has been to oversee the internal 
processes of the White House to ensure that they do not "mess up." 
</P>
<P>
 As he has done before, Clinton complained about the political use that 
Republicans have made of the Whitewater matter, saying that "there is no 
evidence of abuse of authority on my part as President, or any of the kinds of 
things for which their parties and administrations were accused. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republicans have behaved in a fairly blatant, bald and totally political 
way," Clinton said. "Since they have often complained in the past of political 
motivation, I think that they would show a little more restraint and judgment 
in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 But White House officials made it clear that Clinton, who thought the 
Whitewater issue had been taken off his back by the appointment of Fiske as a 
special counsel earlier this year, also believes that he was let down by 
members of his staff, including Nussbaum. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Nussbaum subsequently met in the Oval Office, and officials 
predicted that the presidential aide's resignation would come Friday evening. 
After news of the subpoenas surfaced, officials said the announcement was put 
off but that it could come as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
 The formal letters of resignation and presidential acceptance were prepared 
and ready for release, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 57-year-old Nussbaum has long been close to the First Family. As a lawyer 
on the House Judiciary Committee's staff when it considered the impeachment of 
President Richard Nixon during his Administration's Watergate scandal, Nussbaum 
hired the young Hillary Rodham and supervised her work. She, in turn, 
introduced him to her then-boyfriend, Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 During the presidential contest, Nussbaum, who had subsequently carried on a 
highly successful career as a litigator, provided advice and counsel to Clinton 
during some of the campaign's toughest moments, including the week that 
Gennifer Flowers, a former Little Rock night club singer, publicly accused 
Clinton of carrying on a lengthy extramarital affair with her. 
</P>
<P>
 After the election, Clinton asked Nussbaum to take on the counsel's job. In 
that post, he had some notable successes. He oversaw the process that led to 
the appointment of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court and the selection 
of Louis J. Freeh to head the FBI.  
</P>
<P>
 But more often, Nussbaum seemed to pop up in the middle of problem areas. 
</P>
<P>
 He was widely accused within the White House of having mishandled the aborted 
nomination of Judge Kimba M. Wood to be attorney general and the nomination of 
C. Lani Guinier to head the Justice Department's civil rights division. 
</P>
<P>
 He also participated in the controversy that began with the firing of the 
staff of the White House travel office. 
</P>
<P>
 After his deputy, Vincent Foster, apparently committed suicide last summer, 
Nussbaum supervised the White House effort to manage the police investigation, 
leading to still-unsubstantiated accusations that he blocked investigators in 
an attempt to hide something. 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum's defenders accused critics of having twisted his actions -- 
ascribing sinister motives to innocent decisions. But even his friends conceded 
that Nussbaum consistently appeared to ignore the political and public aspects 
of representing a client who is President of the United States.

SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCHELL TO STEP DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) announced Friday that he 
will not seek reelection this year, a surprise move by a staunch ally of 
President Clinton that may affect prospects for Administration programs in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's decision will remove a respected leader whose influence and 
negotiating skills helped get Clinton's legislative proposals through Congress. 
It also may add to Democratic difficulties as they try to retain their 56-44 
edge over Republicans in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Five Democrats and three Republicans have now announced that they will not 
seek reelection this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said only that he will "consider other challenges" in either public 
office or private employment, leaving even some of his best friends guessing 
about why he quit at the peak of his power as a key Democratic strategist on 
Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Some colleagues speculated that he would accept a reported offer to become 
commissioner of major league baseball, while Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W. Va.) 
suggested that Mitchell, a former federal judge, would be a good candidate for 
the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've made no final decision on the future," said Mitchell, who colleagues 
have said showed "excessive dignity" in the leadership position to which he was 
elected five years ago. "I'll consider other forms of public service and the 
private sector. No doubt some will search for other reasons for my decision. 
But there aren't any." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said he started thinking about leaving the Senate about a month ago. 
One close friend said that, at age 60, Mitchell wanted to keep his options open 
for a job change before he concluded another six-year term, when he would be 
past the usual retirement age of 65. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Democrats -- and some Republicans -- showered praise on Mitchell, and 
many mourned his coming departure. "It is the worst news I can imagine for the 
Senate and for the nation," said Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.). 
</P>
<P>
 In an emotional tribute at a White House news conference, Clinton said: "He 
will be very difficult to replace. . . . He is a wonderful man. I will miss him 
a lot. And America is deeply in his debt." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) lauded Mitchell. "He has been a 
great leader for his party," Dole said. "His word is his bond, and that means a 
lot when it comes to leading the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, chairman of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee, 
sounded a more partisan note. "It gives us another opportunity to elect another 
Republican so that Bob Dole will be the majority leader," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no clear favorite Friday to succeed Mitchell in the Senate 
leadership post. Veteran Democratic Sens. J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana and 
Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii have sought the position in the past and may decide 
to do so again. Sen. Thomas K. Daschle (D-S.D.), a Mitchell protege and 
chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee, is also regarded as a possible 
contender. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice will be made by Senate Democrats after the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
 On almost every major piece of legislation in the last five years, Mitchell 
played a leading role, but he did some of his best work out of public view as 
he negotiated legislative compromises. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently prevailed in a rugged battle against a constitutional amendment 
designed to force a balanced federal budget, a proposal that he scorned as a 
gimmick that would do little to reduce the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Mitchell orchestrated support for Clinton's economic program that 
got through the Senate only when Vice President Al Gore cast a tie-breaking 
vote.  
</P>
<P>
 He promised to devote the rest of 1994 to action on health care reform as well 
as welfare, crime and campaign-finance measures. 
</P>
<P>
 His retirement -- announced first to the President after a White House dinner 
Thursday night and reported Friday afternoon by television stations in his home 
state -- left his Senate colleagues thunderstruck. His reelection had been 
regarded as a sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an unusual day when a senator at the height of his power leaves for no 
apparent reason," said Harold C. Pachios, a Portland, Me., attorney and 
personal friend of Mitchell. "I know he likes his job, but George believes that 
if he runs again, he'd be obliged to serve six years and he couldn't be certain 
that he'd be there the entire six years." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell declared his intentions with a few simple sentences in a statement 
paid for by his campaign committee and broadcast over Maine TV stations Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in good health and good spirits," he said. "I've worked hard for 15 years 
to serve the people of Maine fairly and effectively. I've enjoyed that service 
and it's the right time to consider other challenges." 
</P>
<P>
 His departure from the race will leave a large void in Maine politics and is 
certain to set off a scramble to succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell was appointed to his seat in 1980 to replace Edmund S. Muskie, who 
became secretary of state in the Jimmy Carter Administration. He won a full 
term in 1982 with 61% of the vote and a second term in 1988 with 81%. A recent 
poll put him 60 points ahead of Republican Stephen M. Zirnkilton, 35, the 
assistant state House minority leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's farewell address to Maine voters was a mixture of plain talk, 
patriotism and sentimentality. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the most fortunate people ever to have lived, to be Americans, citizens 
of the most free, the most open society in all of human history," he said. "I 
consider myself especially fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother was an immigrant, my father the orphan son of immigrants. They had 
no education, but they dedicated their lives to the education of their 
children. . . . They taught me that, in America, there's no limit to how far 
you can go if you get a good education and you're willing to work hard." 
</P>
<P>
 In thanking his supporters, Mitchell said that anyone who contributed to his 
campaign and wanted a refund would receive it. The remaining funds will be used 
to set up a scholarship program, he said.

WHITE RIGHTISTS, ZULUS REGISTER FOR S. AFRICA VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of threatening to boycott the country's first democratic 
elections, leaders of a key Zulu nationalist party and an umbrella group of 
white extremists rushed to register for the April ballot late Friday night, 
shortly before a final, midnight deadline expired. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party formally registered but set stiff 
conditions to run in the historic elections, including use of international 
mediation to help solve disputes over a broad range of constitutional issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Inkatha party, led by Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, is the 
country's third-largest political party and the chief black rival to Nelson 
Mandela's African National Congress. It is based in Natal province, an area 
that has suffered some of the country's worst political bloodletting. 
</P>
<P>
 Political leaders and analysts said Inkatha's decision to register may help 
cut the country's staggering pre-poll violence and lessen the chance that 
further clashes and intimidation will undermine the legitimacy of the April 
26-28 election that will bring South Africa its first black-led government. 
</P>
<P>
 A leader of the Afrikaner Volksfront, an umbrella group of more than 60 
right-wing white separatist groups that have vehemently opposed the election 
and the country's interim constitution, also unexpectedly registered for South 
Africa's first all-race elections. 
</P>
<P>
 But the right-wing leader, retired Gen. Constand Viljoen, said he had 
provisionally registered the Volksfront without members' prior approval "due to 
the limited time available." 
</P>
<P>
 He registered the group under a new name, the Freedom Front, shortly before 
midnight. It was the last party to join. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of his move was not immediately clear. Viljoen, considered a 
moderate, was heckled and booed off a stage by thousands of khaki-clad 
militants last month when he publicly proposed registering the Volksfront for 
the election rather than using armed force to fight for a whites-only homeland 
in the post-apartheid nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized that the freedom to exercise the strategic options of the 
Afrikaner people would be severely restricted if we did not register 
provisionally," Viljoen said in a statement Friday to the South African Press 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was registering "only in anticipation of possible results of 
negotiations or international mediation." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela agreed to international mediation Thursday, two days after meeting 
with Buthelezi in Durban. 
</P>
<P>
 Although several possible candidates for mediator have been floated in the 
press, no one has been formally named; the timing and terms of outside 
mediation have not been announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Frank Mdlalose, Inkatha's national chairman, told reporters after he had 
registered the party that "preparation for mediation" was under way. Inkatha 
has demanded greater autonomy for a Zulu state than is now provided for under 
the country's interim constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic, down-to-the-wire decisions to join the democratic process after 
many months of uncertainty seemed sure to change the political landscape and 
campaign arithmetic less than eight weeks before the elections and the end of 
three centuries of white-minority rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-nine parties, many of them tiny and organized within the previous 24 
hours in hopes of winning a ringside seat in Parliament for the birth of the 
new nation, had registered to join the race by the Friday midnight deadline, 
said a spokeswoman for the Independent Electoral Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The parties must submit lists of candidates for the national and provincial 
parliaments by Wednesday to be named on the ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 Inkatha and Volksfront are the most important members of the Freedom Alliance, 
an odd negotiating coalition of conservative black and right-wing white 
separatist groups opposed to the ANC and the interim constitution that will be 
the charter for a five-year government of national unity. 
</P>
<P>
 Alliance members want the constitution to provide greater protection for 
regional autonomy, including guarantees that the ANC cannot overrule their 
decisions once it takes power. 
</P>
<P>
 The ANC has made concessions but has adamantly ruled out allowing independent, 
sovereign homelands for Zulus, white separatists or other ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance has appeared in disarray in recent days as indications of a split 
became more apparent. The pro-apartheid Conservative Party announced Friday 
that it will continue its election boycott, despite reports of a near-mutiny by 
party members serving in the current Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Political leaders and analysts said the Inkatha and Volksfront leaders' 
decisions to join the democratic process after months of threatening to fight 
may help curb the kind of violence that claimed nearly 4,000 lives last year. 
</P>
<P>
 A chief cause of the bloodletting is the longstanding rivalry between Inkatha 
supporters and the ANC, especially in Zulu-dominated Natal province. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact they (Inkatha) are participating brings a greater amount of calmness 
to the process," Olaus van Zyl, executive director of President Frederik W. de 
Klerk's ruling National Party, said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tom Lodge, a political scientist at the University of the Witwatersrand, 
warned that traditional enmities among Zulus and between them and their rivals 
will not end. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't matter much on the ground," he said. "But it's an improvement. It's 
better to fight for votes than fight to keep people from voting." 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo Sexwale, ANC candidate for regional premier of the Johannesburg-Pretoria 
area, said he welcomed Buthelezi's last-minute decision to join the race but 
was bitter nonetheless at the brinkmanship of the last few months. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was foolhardy for anybody to hold out and threaten the country with civil 
war just because they were afraid to put themselves before the people's vote," 
he said in a telephone interview. "I don't think the strategy gained them 
anything except enemies. We're all heaving a sigh of relief, it's true. But 
that's because these people were holding the process to ransom. They were 
holding a pistol to the heads of South Africans." 
</P>
<P>
 The last few weeks have seen considerable political tumult here. 
</P>
<P>
 The massacre of 15 ANC election workers in Natal on Feb. 19, and the death of 
at least 30 others in poll-related violence there over the same weekend, led to 
a flurry of political activity. 
</P>
<P>
 That led to a meeting Tuesday between Buthelezi and Mandela, his archrival. 
Although the two men have traded insults and recriminations in recent months, 
they emerged hand in hand after more than eight hours. Buthelezi then 
unexpectedly said for the first time that he was considering registering. 
</P>
<P>
 As Mandela beamed beside him, Buthelezi insisted that registering for the 
election would not mean that his party would actually run in the campaign. That 
decision, he said, would be made only after party officials could evaluate any 
progress made in mediation or other negotiating forums. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, Buthelezi subsequently issued conflicting statements of his 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 He also complained that it was "unreasonable and unfair" to give Inkatha so 
little time to organize for the race, considering that the government and ANC 
launched their national campaigns in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela said he believes that the mediation could be completed in less than a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Mandela and De Klerk have said repeatedly that they will not consider 
postponing the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Inkatha has been quietly preparing for the race for months in Natal 
and appears as well organized on the ground as its rivals.

DOGS TRAINED FOR DISASTERS ARE AN ALL-TOO-RARE BREED; EMERGENCIES: ALTHOUGH 
MOST SAT OUT THE NORTHRIDGE QUAKE, THERE MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH NEXT TIME, 
OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANNE KLEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They are of a certain breed, these people of the disaster dogs. Crazy about 
their animals, psyched for catastrophe, altruists at heart. 
</P>
<P>
 And their dogs? A very elite corps. In all of California, there are only seven 
working dogs certified ready for disaster work, the toughest there is. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake could have been their Big One, rife with canine 
heroics etched in the public's mind. But with few collapsed buildings, the dogs 
mostly sat on the sidelines, without the kind of publicity that could have 
rallied more people -- and dogs -- to their cause: saving human lives. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which has left the dog people warning that when the next one hits, the 
dearth of disaster dogs may prove disastrous indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 There are hundreds of dogs who work for a living, tracking wandering 
Alzheimer's patients and children lost in the woods. Dogs sniff out everything 
from accelerants used by arsonists to narcotics smuggled by criminals to 
homemade sausages lovingly tucked inside a traveler's suitcase from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 But disaster dogs, who inhabit yet another realm in the service of human 
beings, are much scarcer than the other working types. About four years after 
California developed its system of eight urban search-and-rescue units -- and 
assigned four dogs and handlers to each 56-member team -- the state is still 25 
dogs short. 
</P>
<P>
 And all but Hek, the retired police dog, live outside the Los Angeles County 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the case of a really big disaster, with lots of buildings down, the 
smartest thing we could do would be to call on Switzerland," says Hek's owner 
and volunteer handler, Inglewood Police Sgt. Ty Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
 In a disaster, not just any dog can have its day. 
</P>
<P>
 The training is long and arduous. The dogs must be unflappable, agile, 
obedient and must love to play. 
</P>
<P>
 They should be able to distinguish between a living person or, say, Pseudo 
Corpse 1 and Pseudo Corpse 2, and among the "body in a bottle" scents designed 
to train the sensitive canine nose. They should not expect anything beyond 
praise, or perhaps an edible treat, as a reward. 
</P>
<P>
 The same goes for their handlers. In the world of canine disaster work, 
volunteerism rules. Money and time are tight. And, as the Northridge earthquake 
proved, not even disasters guarantee a stage for the dogs to strut their stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 In a disaster, trained canines are the quickest and surest way to find people 
buried by debris. As such, the dog people have spent years trying to persuade 
government officials that Chicken Littles they are not. Infrared sensors can't 
see through concrete; fancy listening equipment is all but useless amid the 
cacophony of disaster work. 
</P>
<P>
 Many dog people yearn to emulate the Swiss, whose state-supported dog teams 
travel the world on a moment's notice to discover people hidden under rubble, 
mud and snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Swiss model may forever be a pipe dream in the United States, the 
ranks of certified disaster dogs are expected to grow. California handlers say 
about a dozen are making sufficient progress. But in Fontana last weekend, 
nearly half the dogs who took state certification tests flunked. 
</P>
<P>
 And California, mecca for calamities natural and man-made, is more advanced 
than any other state in the field of emergency response, including dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency copied California when it set up its 
own national disaster response network of 25 units, including California's 
eight. But they, too, are always short of dogs. Several disaster teams 
throughout the country can't yet muster a single one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not prepared," says Shirley Hammond, a volunteer handler in Palo Alto 
who coordinates disaster dogs for California's Office of Emergency Services. 
"It's hard for those of us who have spent all this time training to realize 
that we are not making that big a dent." 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons range from perennial money problems to disasters that strike 
without warning. Unlike other working dogs -- such as those used by law 
enforcement to sniff out drugs, explosives and smuggled human beings -- a 
disaster dog could conceivably spend its entire career in training, just 
waiting for the Big Enough One to strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would love to have seven times 70 dogs," says Michael Douglass, the Office 
of Emergency Services' assistant chief in the fire and rescue division. "It's 
just that it takes a lot of time. And all the handlers, for the most part, are 
volunteers." 
</P>
<P>
 This brings a special set of problems, too. In California, there are four 
separate and often feuding associations of search-and-rescue dogs, of which 
disaster dogs are the most highly trained. 
</P>
<P>
 Each believes its training methods are best. All members are passionate about 
their animals and dedicated to the nobility of volunteer disaster search. Some, 
such as Hammond, even quit their paying jobs to always be available should 
disaster call. 
</P>
<P>
 "(But) their dogs get along much better than they do," says Mark Ghilarducci, 
manager of the program in the Office of Emergency Services. "The handlers can 
be their own worst enemies. We can't get them to agree on a damn thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The same can be said for dog people nationwide. "We are all strong-minded and 
have got an opinion," says Bill Dotson, a nationally recognized dog trainer who 
works with Virginia's Dogs East. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, however, the Office of Emergency Services convinced the 
disaster dog people to form a confederation that administers tests -- such as 
the one held last weekend -- to certify dogs for disaster work in the state. 
The California standard is more rigorous than that used by FEMA for national 
and international disaster work. 
</P>
<P>
 The dog associations are still grumbling, however, over the California 
standards (too tough or not tough enough?) and whether the pass/fail method of 
grading is best. One recent canine aspirant, for example, failed because it 
urinated during the exam. Another was hit by a car and injured its leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another dog, already certified ready, has been involuntarily (perhaps 
temporarily) retired because its owner, an Inglewood police officer, just gave 
birth to her second child. Human families still come first. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino awoke to one of its worst disasters May 12, 1989, when a 
freight train hauling 69 cars full of trona derailed and crashed into a 
residential neighborhood at Duffy Street. Eleven homes were seriously damaged 
and four people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the trona, an ash-like compound of hydrous sodium carbonate, had 
blanketed the area, rescue workers had no way to know whether anybody else was 
buried under the debris. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Office of Emergency Services called for search-and-rescue dogs by 10 
a.m., but it was not until six hours later that Shirley Hammond and her red 
Doberman, Cinnamon, arrived from Northern California. Within minutes of its 
arrival, the dog picked up a human scent and local resident Chris Shaw was 
rescued.  
</P>
<P>
 "What I could not understand is that there were literally no qualified dogs 
around," says state Assemblyman Paul A. Woodruff (R-Moreno Valley), who was at 
the scene. "We had to fly one in. If that person had had any serious injury, or 
just loss of blood, he would have been dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodruff's has been a lonely voice for the dogs in Sacramento, and he is not 
running for reelection this year. And the limited use of disaster dogs during 
the Northridge earthquake didn't exactly start a legislative stampede to the 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this does is again postpone the inevitable," Woodruff says. "The 
question is: How many children are going to have to die in a collapsed 
classroom before local government takes advantage of sharing responsibility for 
acquiring these dogs?" 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Like most of Southern California, firefighter Walt Harrison and his family in 
Yucaipa awoke with a jolt before dawn Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 As a volunteer member of Riverside County's urban search-and-rescue team, 
Harrison was prepared. After the shaking stopped, he and his wife and three 
children -- and his disaster dog, Misty -- moved into their trailer stocked 
with emergency supplies. Then he waited for the call directing him to the 
quake's front lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was excited about going," Harrison says. "That's what I live for. I want to 
find live people. I've spent 3 1/2 years preparing her. It's like being a 
fireman. You like going to the big fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison's mobilization call came at 8 a.m. "Misty knew," he says of his 
yellow Lab. "She sees me getting my stuff, she knows we're going to search. She 
loves it." 
</P>
<P>
 But mostly, Harrison and his dog just stood by. To combat boredom, they walked 
around and watched TV. By the time they were summoned to the collapsed 
Northridge Meadows apartment complex, it was the afternoon of Jan. 18, the day 
after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 There, Misty joined Cobb's dog from Inglewood and a golden retriever from 
Bakersfield. And she quickly let Harrison know she smelled humanity amid the 
smashed mass of concrete debris. 
</P>
<P>
 She did not bark, however, as she had done so many times in training when she 
"alerts." Instead, she pawed at the floor. The victim -- the last one found at 
the complex -- was dead. The smell is distinct. 
</P>
<P>
 No dog working during the disaster discovered anyone alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue workers who were at the Northridge Meadows apartments say they believe 
most of the victims died shortly after the earthquake. Bringing in the disaster 
dogs earlier would not have changed the result, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 There were dogs from the Los Angeles Police Department at the apartment 
building on the morning of the collapse, but these "felony dogs," who track 
armed suspects, are not trained for disaster work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are, of course, many levels of disasters to which dogs and handlers 
around the country respond. Hundreds of dog teams find people lost in the 
woods, in the snow, underwater and underground. The training for each location 
is different, although principles overlap. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sigma chemical company in St. Louis, for example, manufactures an 
artificial odor of decomposing bodies -- Pseudo Corpse 1 and Pseudo Corpse 2 -- 
which dog handlers find ideal for training animals for what they call "land 
cadaver" work, the uncovering of graves. 
</P>
<P>
 Using "body in a bottle," as the chemical is affectionately known to handlers, 
is much easier than using real body parts -- primarily from accidents -- which, 
until Pseudo Corpse's arrival about two years ago, was a training norm. 
</P>
<P>
 Handlers dab the chemical, which is far too subtle for a human to smell, on an 
object, bury it and order the dog to search. 
</P>
<P>
 The best dogs for such work, handlers say, are those who love to dig. Other 
rescue dogs are better suited to aquatic careers. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent dog team training seminar in Wiggins, Miss., Kody, a 3-year-old 
golden retriever, was showing off his water skills, eagerly jumping into a boat 
at the 1,900-acre Flint Water Park, his black nose held high as he sniffed the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon Kody was barking at a spot in the water where a diver was hidden below. 
Angie Messina, the dog's owner, says Kody has recovered 43 drowning victims in 
the lakes and bayous around her home in Slidell, La. 
</P>
<P>
 The human scent lifts off the water at the spot where the victim goes down. 
But because smell travels much as smoke does, a handler must mentally map the 
air currents before sending rescue divers down. Sometimes handlers throw talcum 
powder in the air so they can see the air flow. 
</P>
<P>
 Kody, too, was summoned along with other members of Slidell's all-volunteer 
American Search & Rescue Assn. to the site of Amtrak's worst train wreck 
outside Mobile, Ala., last September. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-four people were killed when a barge pulled by a tugboat strayed into a 
bayou shrouded in fog, then smacked into a railroad trestle minutes before the 
Amtrak Sunset Limited roared across -- and off -- the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kody has found many bodies before, the sudden crush of disaster 
victims seemed to overwhelm the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dog, as seasoned as he is, he was so depressed," Messina says. "I had to 
work real hard over three or four days to bring him back up. The more 
experienced dogs, who knew what they were there for, they were depressed. The 
area was saturated with the death smell."  
</P>
<P>
 Usually, however, handlers say that as gruesome as rescue work might turn out 
to be, for the dog it is play. Barry Orange, a veterinarian in Clark, N.J., 
says his Rottweiler, Maxine, loved the excitement in the aftermath of the World 
Trade Center bombing last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's real rough and tumble," Orange says. "She does good in collapsed 
buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange and his dog were called in two days after the explosion to find bodies, 
but had to leave because conditions were still unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Maxine was rewarded for a job well done. If dogs don't get a prize, 
they won't bother playing the search-and-rescue game. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer Carol Gardner, who works her coon hound, Polly, in searches 
throughout the South, says experience has taught her to first brief the family 
of a victim beforehand about on how the process works. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them, 'I'm going to do everything I can to find him,' " Gardner says. 
" 'And I want you to know that it is not that I am being disrespectful, but 
when I do find him, I'm going to praise the dog. I'm going to play with him.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That is often tough. Last November, police in Irvington, Ala., called Gardner 
and Polly to search for the head of a woman whose sexually mutilated body they 
had found. They closed off the interstate freeway and Polly sniffed at the spot 
in the dense grass where the body had been found. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 10 minutes, the dog found a tissue with the victim's lip print and a 
perfume bottle -- and then, her head. 
</P>
<P>
 "She alerted, and was digging and kind of yelped," Gardner says. "I figured 
that was it, but I really didn't want to see. Then, finally, I thought I'd 
better look, to make sure. It was the head, all right."

O.C. CONFERENCE TO CHART ORANGUTAN'S SURVIVAL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sacrificed to a worldwide demand for mahogany to fashion into desks and dining 
tables, lost to a need for land to feed a growing population, the rain forests 
of Borneo and Sumatra are fast dwindling. And as these big trees fall, so too 
goes the only habitat of the orangutan. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, half a world away from where the species is making its last stand, 
scientists, zoo administrators, conservationists and government officials meet 
at Cal State Fullerton to assess the accelerating threats facing the orangutan 
and forge a strategy to help it survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ultimate problem, like it is for so many species on this planet, is 
habitat destruction," said Birute Galdikas, co-founder of the Los Angeles-based 
Orangutan Foundation International, who has spent the last 23 years studying 
orangutans in the forests of Borneo. "Without the trees they simply cannot 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Uncertainties abound over just how many orangutans remain in the wild, but 
experts believe as much as half the population has been lost over the past 
decade, and the shaggy red ape could be extinct soon after the turn of the 
century if current deforestation practices continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Named for an Indonesian phrase meaning "man of the forest," orangutans are the 
most solitary of the great apes, ranging widely as they travel through the 
forest canopy. As development of their once-lush island habitat continues, the 
highly intelligent animals -- among the closest living relatives to humankind 
-- are forced to survive in smaller and more isolated pockets of protected 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 Two large islands in the Indonesian archipelago, Borneo and Sumatra, were 
still heavily covered with forests when Galdikas began her independent studies 
in 1971. Since then, an estimated 80% of the orangutan's habitat has been 
cleared, both through commercial logging and agriculture. The orangutan 
population is estimated today at anywhere from 20,000 to 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers hope this weekend's conference will go beyond traditional academic 
presentations to plans for protecting the endangered primate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, at these kinds of sessions you go, you read your paper and you go 
home," said Lori Sheeran, faculty adviser for the conference. "Here, we want 
something concrete." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, academic conferences have had "a minimal impact on conservation 
of species," said Ulysses Seal, a conservation biologist. "This reflects a 
longstanding division between the academic and the conservation communities." 
That division, he said, is slowly dissolving, as the Fullerton conference 
illustrates. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "Orang utans: The Neglected Ape," the three-day meeting was organized 
by Norm Rosen, a graduate student in anthropology at Cal State Fullerton who 
learned in the course of his research two years ago that there hadn't been a 
major academic conference on the animal since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been so many years since conservationists and field people and zoo 
people have gotten together to discuss the problems facing orangutans," Rosen 
said. He approached the faculty of the university's anthropology department and 
decided to organize the conference as his master's project. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of individuals and organizations have worked together to bring the 
conference to Fullerton, including the school's Anthropology Student Assn., the 
Zoological Society of San Diego and Zoo Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with a renewed commitment from the Indonesian government, deforestation 
and illegal hunting -- for food and for the pet trade -- continue. Much of the 
logging is selective, but often the trees left standing by loggers are quickly 
felled to make room for agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, said Mark Leighton a Harvard University professor, too little is known 
about the eating habits and movements of the animal to create an effective 
management plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a strong need for better surveys of remaining forested areas in 
Borneo, and in some cases a redesign of the reserve system," Leighton said. 
Also, he said, "it has to be approached as a comprehensive problem, not just 
orangutans." 
</P>
<P>
 Borneo and Sumatra are home to a number of equally endangered forest species, 
many of them found nowhere else: proboscis monkeys, clouded leopards, Sumatran 
tigers, even rhinoceroses. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservation situation in Sumatra is somewhat different. The island, all 
of which is part of the nation of Indonesia, has a single national park of more 
than 2.2 million acres. Partly as a result of a workshop organized by Seal in 
Sumatra last year, the Indonesian government has set as a goal a sustained 
population of 10,000 orangutans on that island. Seal estimates there are 
currently about 8,500 on the island, some 30% of them living outside the 
national park on less-protected lands. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of the Indonesian effort will depend largely on international 
financial support for park management and basic research, Seal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 60 professionals will make presentations at the conference, and about 
200 more will attend. In addition to Galdikas and Seal, other top orangutan 
experts to take part include J.A.R.A.M. van Hooff of Rijksuniversiteit Utrecht 
in the Netherlands, Jito Sugardjito, an Indonesian scientist affiliated with 
the World Wildlife Fund, and Terry L. Maple, director of Zoo Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Through accounts in the mainstream press and on television, Galdikas is 
probably the best known to the public. She is one of the so-called "Leakey's 
Angels," three students of famed anthropologist Louis Leakey, who went out to 
study great apes in their natural homes. Jane Goodall, famous for her studies 
of chimpanzees, was another; Dian Fossey, who championed the preservation of 
the mountain gorilla until her murder in 1985, was the third. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Galdikas has spent increasing amounts of her energy on 
promoting preservation, leading some to criticize her for neglecting research. 
</P>
<P>
 She downplays such comments: "I think, given the desperate nature of the 
situation, we must consider the conservation issues to be of primary 
importance," Galdikas said by telephone from a home she maintains in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Her relationship with the Indonesian government has been strained at times, 
but Galdikas said she has seen a major shift in the last year. "I think there's 
a new maturity in the Indonesian forestry department," she said. "I've been 
very, very pleased." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990s are "a critical decade" in determining whether the orangutan will 
survive in the wild, said Leighton, the Harvard University researcher who has 
done field work in Borneo for 20 years. There is hope, he said, but that hope 
hinges on a number of needs: more research on how the animals live, better 
management schemes, more money and training to implement those plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, obstacles remain in Kalimantan, the Indonesian state that comprises the 
southern two-thirds of Borneo (most of the northern part of the island is under 
Malaysian control). Orangutans there number between 10,000 and 15,000, by 
Leighton's best guess, but many of those are in scattered and fragmented 
populations that may be too small to survive over time. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme of this weekend's conference, "The Neglected Ape," reflects the 
belief of many that orangutans get less press than their more-publicized 
cousins, the gorillas and the chimpanzees, and that an increased public 
awareness could lead to more dollars for conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as Galdikas is concerned, however, the orangutan has suffered from too 
much attention -- of the wrong kind, from loggers and poachers. "I think what 
the orangutans need is a lot more neglect," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Galdikas said she still feels the same connection with her research subjects 
as when she first went into the jungle as a UCLA graduate of 25, a connection 
amplified by a sense of urgency over their fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look into an orangutan's eyes, the eyes that look back mirror our 
own," she said. "We recognize his or her affinity, that there is something else 
on this earth that is almost us. In a way, we're looking at where we've been."

2 MEXICAN OFFICERS AMONG 4 KILLED IN TIJUANA SHOOTOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Four men -- two of them police officers -- were killed on a busy downtown 
street Thursday night during a fierce gun battle that authorities said may have 
pitted federal and state law enforcement officers against one another. 
</P>
<P>
 The bloody incident, which also left three federal police officers 
hospitalized in serious condition, appears to have been drug-related, Baja 
California Gov. Ernesto Ruffo Appel said Friday. But Ruffo said it was not 
clear if the mysterious confrontation was a clash between drug traffickers and 
police or between rival police officers, some of whom may have been protecting 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the state and federal officers wielding AK-47 rifles and other 
heavy weapons appeared to exchange gunfire with one another during the 
terrifying shootout at a busy intersection of Boulevard Diaz Ordaz that is 
ringed by shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we heard were volleys, like machine guns, and it went on and on," said a 
merchant who was nearby when the shooting started and identified himself only 
as Agustin. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun battle began about 8:45 p.m. and lasted up to five minutes, leaving 
surrounding stores and the three Chevrolet Suburbans driven by the officers 
riddled with dozens of bullet holes.  
</P>
<P>
 "We know only the results, that four people are dead," said Cmdr. Jorge 
Alvarez Barriere of the Baja State Judicial Police. "The rest is being 
investigated." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez said it is possible that officers fired on one another by mistake. 
Investigators are trying to determine whether federal and state officers shot 
at one another, and who fired the fatal shots, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of the worst drug-related slayings of police officers in recent 
memory in Tijuana. The city has experienced periodic spectacular shootouts 
involving drug cartels vying for the lucrative smuggling turf of the 
U.S.-Mexico border. There have been cases here and elsewhere in Mexico in which 
state and federal officers have provided protection for drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence had declined during the last year because of an intense manhunt 
for the fugitive leaders of Tijuana's Arellano cartel, who are wanted in 
connection with a Guadalajara shootout last May that left a Roman Catholic 
cardinal and six other people dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead in Thursday's shooting included Cmdr. Alejandro Castaneda Andrade, 
chief of a Mexico City-based anti-drug unit of the Mexican Federal Judicial 
Police, and Salvador Miramontes, an investigator for the state judicial police, 
which investigates felonies. The other two dead men and the three wounded 
federal police officers were not identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting the gravity of the incident, Mexican federal Atty. Gen. Diego 
Valades left Mexico City for Tijuana on Friday to lead the investigation of the 
incident, a federal spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal judicial police have prime responsibility for investigating drug 
crime in Mexico. Special units from Mexico City -- such as the one commanded by 
Castaneda -- have led the hunt for the three Arellano kingpins who are wanted 
in the Guadalajara murders. The units have made unannounced sweeps and raids in 
Tijuana during the last nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal and state officers in Tijuana were not alerted when a special unit 
swooped in late last year and arrested a brother of one of the Arellano 
kingpins in Tijuana. The secretive operations of the federal special units have 
fomented accusations in the press that some local law enforcement officials are 
in league with drug lords. 
</P>
<P>
 Although one U.S. drug agent said the brazenness of Thursday's shooting seems 
typical of the ruthless Arellano organization, officials said there was no 
evidence of the group's involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he thought the Arellanos were involved, Baja Atty. Gen. Juan 
Francisco Franco Rios said, "I don't think so, because those gentlemen have 
been on the run." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, investigators, officials and reporters milled about the 
headquarters of the state and federal police as officers with automatic weapons 
stood guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Few details were made available about what might have triggered the bloodshed 
and whether officers fired at one another or at drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 Miramontes, the state officer, and a partner were riding in a vehicle that 
came under fire as it was stopped at a stoplight, according to Cmdr. Alvarez. 
The officers were on duty at the time, Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were approached by someone who started shooting at them," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said they saw an argument between the state officers in one vehicle 
and federal officers riding in two other vehicles before the shooting, 
according to journalist Enrique Garcia Sanchez, who went to the scene after 
hearing the shots. Gunmen in at least one other vehicle, described by witnesses 
as a Volkswagen Jetta, also took part.  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators recovered 14 weapons, including three belonging to state 
judicial officers, Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is being investigated jointly by the state and federal forces, 
officials said.

 Xu Honggang is a Chinese hero for changing times. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember Lei Feng, the army truck driver whom Chairman Mao chose in 1963 as a 
role model for the people? 
</P>
<P>
 Lei, who was accidentally killed by a falling telephone pole in 1962, was 
portrayed as the embodiment of the selfless individual serving his comrades and 
his leader. He even washed his comrades' socks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Learn from Comrade Lei Feng," Mao Tse-tung, China's powerful Communist Party 
boss, urged 31 years ago today. And around this time each year, all over China, 
the nation's youth strive to perform good deeds, though few go as far as 
sock-washing. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 15, for example, the Beijing Youth News reported that 28 students of 
the Youth League Branch of the No. 112 Middle School cleaned the house of an 
elderly woman and cooked her a batch of dumplings.  
</P>
<P>
 But this year, another hero, also from the People's Liberation Army, or PLA, 
has been added to the Chinese pantheon. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Xu Honggang and his heroic battle with a gang of robbers speaks 
to a different, less-innocent China. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the nation at the time of Mao and Lei, this is a get-rich-quick China, 
where corruption is rampant and violent crime causes a growing fear. This is a 
what's-in-it-for-me, "market economy" China, where newspapers are full of 
accounts of citizens who refuse to come to the aid of their compatriots even 
when they are in dire straits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mao's time was an age of idealism, when Lei Feng was the perfect hero," 
explained a young Chinese official over a recent dinner. "Now, we have entered 
the era of materialism. These days we need a hero who will do something even 
when there is no chance of profit." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Chinese history, leaders and sages have sought to shape society by 
holding up individuals as exemplars of virtue. 
</P>
<P>
 The tradition derives from the teachings of Confucius, whose system of ethics 
for a stable society became the basis for centuries of Chinese government. 
</P>
<P>
 Confucianism emphasized virtue, selflessness, duty, patriotism, hard work and 
respect for hierarchy, both familial and societal. His disciples reinforced its 
lessons by popularizing stories about people who represented particular 
virtues.  
</P>
<P>
 Chinese children learn at an early age of such heroes as Mu Lan, a woman of 
the 6th Century who disguised herself as a man and served 12 years as a soldier 
so that her father, too ill to report for military duty, would not be disgraced 
or punished. Mu Lan's story provides a lesson in both courage and filial 
devotion. 
</P>
<P>
 And every summer, the Dragon Boat festival marks the drowning suicide of Qu 
Yuan, a poet and Cabinet minister from the 4th Century BC who is the archetype 
of the loyal government servant. Qu killed himself when his sovereign's failure 
to heed his advice led to national disaster. The annual boat races, and the 
accompanying sacrificial tossing of rice into the water, symbolize the effort 
to save the revered man's body from the fishes.  
</P>
<P>
 Much as the story of the young George Washington and the chopped-down cherry 
tree promoted honesty to early Americans, such heroes have served to inspire 
the people and unify the country. 
</P>
<P>
 For a Chinese leadership struggling to inspire today's youth, Xu the hero 
surfaces at a welcome time. 
</P>
<P>
 His legend has been spread and burnished by dozens of glowing newspaper 
stories published in recent weeks that give essentially the same account of the 
incident: 
</P>
<P>
 The leader of a PLA army communications squad from Yunnan province in the 
mountainous south, Xu is in his early 20s, square-jawed and handsome. He was 
riding a long-distance bus in Sichuan province last Aug. 17 when several 
hooligans began harassing a young woman, demanding money. 
</P>
<P>
 When the woman refused to give them money, the ruffians threatened to strip 
off her clothes and throw her out the window. None of the nearby passengers -- 
including the woman's husband, quaking with fear at her side -- rose to help as 
the toughs, according to the front-page version in the People's Daily, shouted: 
"No money! Push her out!" 
</P>
<P>
 They were about to do just that when Xu, asleep in the back of the bus, was 
awakened by the commotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the slightest hesitation or hint of fear, Xu shouted at the men to 
free the woman. The men, shocked by the challenge, released her but then turned 
on Xu. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus commenced, in the words of the People's Daily's glowing version, the 
"battle between justice and evil" on the bus from Niujie town, Yiliang County, 
Yunnan province to Yunlian County, Sichuan province. 
</P>
<P>
 Knives flashing, the thugs descended on Xu, stabbing him 14 times and opening 
up his stomach until -- the news accounts are quite specific on this detail -- 
"his intestines came out of his body." 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by Xu's example, other passengers jumped into the fray. The driver 
stopped the bus and managed to disarm one of the men. The criminals fled. 
</P>
<P>
 Critically wounded, his insides trailing, Xu pursued the fleeing villains. 
</P>
<P>
 "One meter, two meters, 10 meters," continued the People's Daily account, " . 
. . leaving a 50-meter trail of blood, Xu finally collapsed on the highway." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Beijing Youth Daily's report, when police arrived at the 
scene, Xu at first refused treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm from the PLA," he reportedly said. "Never mind me. Chase the criminals!" 
</P>
<P>
 When news of Xu's heroism spread across the rugged countryside, several 
thousand peasants came to the Yunlian County Hospital, near the Yangtze River 
city of Yibin, to pay tribute to the young soldier. The hospital staff created 
a special 24-hour watch team to help pull him through. 
</P>
<P>
 By this time, reports of his exploit and of his admirable humility had reached 
Beijing, far to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 In Xu, Chinese leaders saw an ideal model for the worrisome new generation 
that seemed to have lost the old-time spirit of self-sacrifice and altruism. As 
soon as he was well enough to travel, they summoned him to be festooned with 
medals and heaped with honors and titles such as "Model of a Loving People," 
"Guard of the People" and "Brave Young Hero." 
</P>
<P>
 The railway ministry gave special permission for his train to stop longer than 
usual at stations along the route, so that he could be seen by adoring crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 The People's Daily reported that on Sept. 16, in Mianchi County, Henan 
province, "thousands of soldiers and people gathered at the station to meet 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews, Xu's personal modesty was found to be as astonishing as his 
heroism. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he owed a debt to the inspiring example of the older generation in his 
home region in Yunnan, a famous cradle of PLA soldiers. He praised the bus 
driver who helped him fight the criminals, and the doctors and nurses who 
treated him. He said he wanted no special treatment for his deed, only to be 
allowed to return to his unit as a common soldier, doing his duty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't consider myself as a hero," he said. "I am still a son of the people 
in the Wumeng Mountain area and an ordinary soldier." 
</P>
<P>
 When he first returned to his military unit, he reportedly refused a car 
offered by local officials. On the train, he gave up his seat to a woman 
carrying a child. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 5, Xu met with President Jiang Zemin, who gripped his hand long and 
hard. The president encouraged Communist Party officials, soldiers and ordinary 
Chinese to "learn from Xu Honggang."  
</P>
<P>
 Newspapers carried long interviews, including an extraordinary Feb. 18 article 
in the People's Daily that covered nearly half the front page. Xu was even 
invited as a guest on a popular television game show. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last week, a time normally devoted to honoring the memory of Lei 
Feng, new hero Xu was in Beijing delivering inspiring talks to students. 
</P>
<P>
 Xu's heroic apotheosis does not mean that he has been tapped by the government 
to replace Lei Feng.  
</P>
<P>
 Guan Changdi, vice director of the Lei Feng Memorial Hall in Fushun, Liaoning 
province, said in a telephone interview that the memorial still averages 1,000 
visitors a day. In March, he said, near the date of Mao's call to "emulate Lei 
Feng," the crowds swell to 5,000 to 6,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 As useful heroes, Lei and Xu are alike in several respects, explained a young 
intellectual in the Foreign Ministry. They both are considered model soldiers 
of the PLA. Both are peacetime soldiers, whose deeds are not related to 
battlefield exploits.  
</P>
<P>
 The basis for Lei's fame was a diary he purportedly wrote detailing modestly 
his everyday good deeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Most foreign Chinese scholars and even many Chinese now believe that the diary 
was a fake, created as a propaganda tool by Mao or his aides.  
</P>
<P>
 For many middle-aged Chinese, however, this knowledge does not diminish their 
respect for Lei. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was young I believed every word of Lei Feng," a Chinese newspaper 
editor admitted. "Even now, I still weep when I see the movie about his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Lei's heroism was more a collection of relatively mundane acts. Mao chose him 
to emphasize simplicity and ordinary, selfless dedication. 
</P>
<P>
 In the conformist Mao years, the kind of person who does his duty without 
complaint and also performs a raft of good deeds, on the order of helping old 
ladies to cross streets, was a useful role model.  
</P>
<P>
 The problem for today's Chinese leadership is that because he is a dead 
do-gooder, Lei's example is losing its power. Somehow, after a brief flurry in 
March, the good deeds that it inspires do not last; neither do the selflessness 
and lack of complaint. As a popular saying has it, "Lei Feng comes in March but 
leaves in April." 
</P>
<P>
 Xu, on the other hand, is a living hero who can inspire not only by his acts 
but also by his presence. He also has other virtues attractive to today's 
youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Handsome as a matinee idol, he is China's own, living action hero, similar to 
the heroes in the kung fu movies so popular here. By his brave acts on the bus, 
he also stands in contrast to the worrisome trend of indifference to people in 
distress. 
</P>
<P>
 To emphasize this point, the Legal Daily newspaper on Feb. 23 listed a series 
of shocking incidents in which people refused to come to the aid of fellow 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 In one July, 1993, case, for example, the newspaper reported that when a man 
was murdered on the dance floor of a Hunan discotheque, the other customers 
simply wiped up the blood and continued dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 The young Foreign Ministry official said that in his own family, there had 
been a near-drowning at a Beijing reservoir because onlookers had refused to 
jump in the water to help without being paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Loading his plate with lemon chicken from a sumptuous buffet table, the young 
man shook his head. "At a particular time in history," he said, "you need a 
hero who fits that time, someone willing to sacrifice for the benefit of 
others." 
</P>
<P>
 In his mind, selfless Xu Honggang, China's living action hero, might be just 
that person.

AHMANSON ENVIRONMENTAL REPORT BACKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO and DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a crushing blow to opponents of the $1-billion Ahmanson Ranch housing 
project, a Ventura County judge on Friday ruled that the environmental impact 
report on the mini-city is adequate and said county officials complied with all 
state environmental laws in approving the development. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court concludes that the Ventura County Board of Supervisors did not 
abuse its discretion in certifying the EIR" and in approving the project, 
Superior Court Judge Barbara A. Lane wrote in her 55-page ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys and government officials representing the nine plaintiffs who had 
sought to overturn the board's 1992 approval of the project said they are 
confident that the case will now go to the 2nd District Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our legal arguments have considerable merit," said Mark Weinberger, the 
attorney representing the city of Malibu. "They should have been upheld by the 
trial court and, certainly, review by the Court of Appeal is a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Malibu, Los Angeles County, the cities of Los Angeles and 
Calabasas, and several homeowner and environmental groups joined in the lawsuit 
against Ventura County and the Ahmanson Land Co. to block construction of the 
3,050-dwelling golf course community. The Ahmanson project would be built in 
the rolling hills just over the Los Angeles County line from the western San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit contended that the development's environmental document did not 
adequately address the impacts on surrounding communities. The opponents also 
argued that while traffic and pollution generated by the development would be 
felt most in Los Angeles County, Ventura County would reap most of the tax 
revenue and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit asked the court to invalidate the county's approval of the 
development and order Ahmanson to conduct a new environmental report. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were surprised and appalled by the ruling," said Ken Bernstein, an aide to 
Los Angeles Councilwoman Laura Chick, whose district would receive the brunt of 
the traffic from the development. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that there were several significant issues unanswered by the EIR, in 
particular the potential traffic impacts on the western San Fernando Valley," 
Bernstein said. "While this may be a well-designed project for Ventura County, 
it's a disaster for the city of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Chick would be meeting with a representative of the Los Angeles city 
attorney's office on Monday to discuss filing an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 In her ruling, Lane wrote that in approving the project, the Ventura County 
supervisors decided that the prospect of receiving nearly 10,000 acres of 
public parklands included in the deal, combined with the project's economic and 
recreational benefits, "outweighed the environmental costs." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not the proper role of the courts to substitute our judgment for that 
of the people and their local representatives," Lane concluded in her ruling. 
"The court's 'limited function' is to assure that the public and its 
responsible officials have been fairly informed of the environmental 
consequences of their decisions before they are made. That was accomplished 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, a key supporter of the 
parkland-for-development deal, said she believed that the judge's ruling 
vindicated the board's decision to approve the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a tremendous victory for those of us who believed this was a 
wonderful compromise," she said. "I always believed we did the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk said she was not worried about the possibility of an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "This judge could not find one thing to hang us up on, so clearly there are no 
glaring errors" made by the board in approving the project, she said. "Even if 
there is an appeal, I feel a lot better in this position." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Weston, the attorney representing Ventura County and Ahmanson, added: "I 
hope (the plaintiffs) will read the opinion and decide that further challenges 
are a waste of time and energy." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemary Woodlock, the attorney representing the environmental group Save Open 
Space in the lawsuit, said she is bothered by what she sees as a trend by trial 
court judges ruling on the side of developers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very frustrating," she said. "A number of environmental lawyers that I 
work with are very concerned that this is becoming routine. It's very 
discouraging." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodlock said her clients, which also include several homeowner groups, will 
probably appeal Lane's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging that the plaintiffs had raised some legitimate concerns, 
Lane said in her ruling that many of the arguments put forth by the petitioners 
against the Ahmanson deal were "political, not legal." 
</P>
<P>
 "The petitioners strongly disapprove of how the board weighed the evidence on 
the environmental benefits of 10,000 acres of public open space" versus the 
detriments cited by the plaintiffs, Lane wrote. "This, however, is a political 
judgment to be answered at the ballot box." 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors voted 4 to 1 to approve the Ahmanson project in 
December, 1992, on condition that Ahmanson Land Co. acquire and turn over to 
state and federal park agencies nearly 10,000 acres of mountain land, most of 
it owned by entertainer Bob Hope. So far, only about 3,000 acres -- including 
Hope's 2,308-acre Jordan Ranch -- has been turned over to park agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson, which has agreed to dedicate 2,633 acres of its ranch as open space, 
must also deliver two other Hope properties to park agencies before it can go 
forward with its development. These include Hope's 4,369-acre Runkle Ranch near 
Chatsworth and his 339-acre Corral Canyon tract in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Under its agreement with the county, Ahmanson has about two years left to 
acquire Hope's land. The developer, concerned about potential financial impacts 
from the lawsuits, had put its plans on hold until a legal settlement is 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Trigg, a spokeswoman for Ahmanson, said the developer was pleased with 
the judge's ruling and would be waiting to see if an appeal is filed before 
moving ahead with its plans.

 QUAKE VICTIM: Sadly, we bid farewell to Tiffany, that most courageous cat who 
had given us so much hope. For 41 days, Tiffany, fleeing after the quake, was 
locked in a storage closet with no food and only rainwater. Last Sunday, she 
was found. The press went crazy. It was a near miracle. . . . But Tiffany 
couldn't overcome malnutrition and dehydration, and died Friday. (B1)

 PARKING BREAK: Sometimes parking can be as unpredictable as the weather. Take 
CSUN. After all the quake devastation, which cost 3,400 spaces, parking was 
supposed to be a nightmare. But emergency lots were quickly created and many 
students have taken shuttles. . . . "At this point, parking is not a problem," 
said a campus spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG RANGE: Maps released Friday by the National Earthquake Information Center 
in Colorado show that the Jan. 17 quake produced significant shaking in places 
far from the Northridge epicenter, including Fresno, Santa Maria and Laughlin, 
Nev. . . . The center used the Mercalli scale, based on interviews and damage 
observations. See A26 for story and map.

 BASEBALL HOTBED: Baseball scouts love the Valley. How many other places can 
you find a Robin Yount, a Jack McDowell, a Bret Saberhagen? Not many. Last 
year, three more Valley high school players were drafted in the second round: 
Nate Dishington, Jeff Suppan and Brad Fullmer. . . . This weekend, as the 
season opens, The Times runs capsules on local high school teams. (C20-22)

O.C. CITIES BALK AT COSTS OF U.S., STATE MANDATES 
</P>

 City officials from Anaheim to Irvine say they don't want anyone to get the 
wrong idea: They are all in favor of clean water, clean air, crossing guards 
and helping save endangered animals. 
</P>
<P>
 But local government leaders complain that federal and state governments 
continue to pass new laws -- then pass the tab on to the cities. 
</P>
<P>
 And, with another season of budget-cutting ahead, city officials across Orange 
County again this week cried "ouch." Just back from a trip to Washington, 
Anaheim city officials complained Friday that they are stuck with more than $20 
million in expenditures to comply with federal laws and nearly $3 million to 
meet state mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach, Irvine, Santa Ana and other municipalities all have similar 
tales of woe. "It's a sneaky way for legislators to take our money," said Santa 
Ana Senior Management Assistant Jill Arthur. "It's hard to quantify the costs 
of an unfunded mandate, so it's hard for the citizenry to see 'they stole this 
much.' 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a lot of visibility on the issue lately, but the state is broke 
and the feds are broke. We're going to an empty turnip truck" for help. 
</P>
<P>
 State and county officials say they don't like passing the buck, but say local 
governments need to bear some of the costs of programs enjoyed by their 
residents. Mandates generally require cities to spend money to comply with 
various regulatory acts and laws or to pay for special-interest programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County chapter of the League of California Cities recently passed a 
resolution calling for the end of such mandates. A local state assemblyman has 
introduced a state constitutional amendment aimed at properly reimbursing local 
governments for paying for state mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, local cities spend millions of dollars to help pay for the 
Endangered Species Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Lead Base Paint Removal plan, 
Americans With Disabilities Act and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clean Water Act alone costs Anaheim about $14 million a year, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are just the federal government's demands. 
</P>
<P>
 On the state level, cities are required to pay for crossing guards, state air 
and water quality programs and dozens of others mandates. And Orange County has 
its hand out too, billing the cities for services such as jail booking and 
landfill gate fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial toll has city leaders grumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real, real big problem," said Kristine Thalman, Anaheim's 
intergovernmental relations officer. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the federal government requires cities to pay for projects with no 
intention of ever reimbursing them. If a city refuses, federal officials can 
withhold other money from the city or impose hefty fines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the carrot and stick with no carrot," said Thalman, who went to 
Washington with other city officials two weeks ago and complained to Orange 
County's congressional delegation about the unfunded mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 Thalman added that the state, in theory, is required to reimburse cities for 
some expenditures. But because of California's financial woes over the past 
several years, cities are lucky if they recoup even a portion of the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some cities have had to cut staff and then hire a recycling coordinator just 
to meet a mandate," said Daryl K. Halls, legislation and policy development 
manager for the League of California Cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't argue with the programs, they're good ideas, but it's a question of 
who is going to pay and it always ends up to be the local governments," he 
said. "It's a burden." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) introduced a 
constitutional amendment to end the practice of passing mandates with no 
financial backing. He wants money for mandates to be set aside up front so 
cities will be able to seek total reimbursement. Similar legislative efforts 
have failed in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of principle," said Shawn Kent, a legislative aide to Pringle. 
"The people who want a program should have the responsibility for funding that 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 Many city officials say the mandates, coupled with the state's withholding of 
revenue previously earmarked for cities, are sapping local resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the one hand they're taking away our property tax dollars by the millions, 
and on the other hand they're asking us to do more and more. We're getting hit 
from both sides," said Santa Ana's Arthur. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, she said, the complexity of mandated programs makes it difficult for 
taxpayers to understand their city's predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen months ago, Irvine city officials compiled their first list outlining 
the costs of unfunded mandates from the county to the federal level, said City 
Manager Paul Brady Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose: to explain to council members just how many costs the city had no 
control over, Brady said. Now, a revamped list compiled in December has been 
passed on to state and federal officials in a plea for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're talking about doing something in Sacramento. Whether it's just talk 
or will be followed by action, I don't know, but I think it helps show that 
there's a united concern," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
 The projected costs of federal, regional and state mandated programs to Irvine 
for this 1993-94 budget year is $3.8 million, Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there has to be continued pressure on state and federal governments 
to stop passing on their costs to cities," Huntington Beach Deputy City 
Administrator Bob Franz said. 
</P>
<P>
 His city tallied $6.8 million in mandates during the 1992-93 fiscal year, 
including obligations passed on by the county and special districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't keep the information in front of the public and the legislative 
representatives," Franz said, "it only gets worse."

 SWEET REVENGE? Former Brea mayor Carrey J. Nelson, who's been on its City 
Council 14 years, has had it with various investigations into his potential 
conflicts over redevelopment -- and critics hounding him from the podium week 
after week. Nelson say he will not seek reelection in November -- but he'll be 
back at council meetings as a private citizen. . . . Says Nelson: "I'll be 
speaking from that podium to some of these people that have taken whacks at me 
all along."

 GREEN FOR A DAY: The annual two-day Irish Faire, which begins today on Laguna 
Canyon Road, is more than just a cultural gathering for the Kiernans and the 
Hartys. Organizer Leonore Coyne says those two families use the occasion of the 
fair to hold their own annual family reunions. . . . "I just got a call saying 
the O'Briens will be doing the same thing," she says. It's a weekend of 
leprechauns, bagpipers, step-dancers and green bagels. And lots of Irish 
potatoes.

 BETTER HEALTH? Rancho Santiago Community College District President Vivian 
Blevins is doing more than making diversity a priority on campus. She was just

President Clinton's White House signing of an executive order speeding up funds 
for Latino education. . . . Says Blevins: "Hispanics are an important part of 
the United States and we must do a better job of educating them if the country

 NO CUB AT THIS: If you're one of those Angels fans who watches even the 
exhibition games, today's may be of special interest to you. It's against the 
Chicago Cubs, and will be televised on cable's WGN at noon. Behind the 
microphone, of course, will be the venerable Harry Caray -- starting his 50th 
year of broadcasting. . . . Harry, whose son and grandson also announce 
baseball, owns his own sports bar in Chicago. And, of course, the number: 
312-HOLY COW.

 ALL ABOARD: No one was more thrilled by Friday's decision to extend Metrolink 
service to Oxnard (B1) than the folks who live near the Moorpark train yard. . 
. . Four commuter trains have been based in Moorpark, prompting complaints from 
residents about engines that start revving at 3 a.m. . . . Now, only two trains 
will be docked in Moorpark. The other two will spend the night in Montalvo. . . 
. "I think it's wonderful," said Connie Lawrason, the wife of Moorpark's mayor. 
"It's sure going to please the neighbors around there."

 SUPER SHAKER: New data released Friday (A26) showed that some of the heaviest 
shaking in the Jan. 17 earthquake was experienced in Ventura County and other 
areas far from the quake's epicenter. . . . The data is based on the Mercalli 
scale, which uses interviews and damage observations to show how severely the 
quake was felt in different areas. . . . Interviews showed 100% of those 
surveyed in Ventura County were awakened by the quake.

 HEROIC EFFORT: As Irma Lopez lay wounded and unable to walk last December, 
felled by a gunman's bullet outside an Oxnard jobs office, she thought she was 
about to die. That's when Ray Gonzales stepped in and dragged her to safety. . 
. . On Tuesday, the Oxnard insurance salesman will by honored by the Ventura 
County Board of Supervisors for his heroism. . . . "I don't think of myself as 
a hero," said Gonzales, a Port Hueneme resident. "I'd like to think if that had 
been my sister or my wife or my mom, somebody would have stepped in and done 
the same thing."

POLITICS; MEXICAN REBELS PROVE MASTERS AT PUBLIC RELATIONS; ZAPATISTAS' 
STRATEGIC EXPERTISE SURPRISED MILITARY EXPERTS. THEIR IMAGE-MAKING SKILLS WIN 
OVER THE MEDIA.

 After 21 hours of bumping along rutted roads in a caravan of crowded minivans 
and scrambling up muddy hills hauling equipment, 200 reporters returned from 
the jungle to this colonial town, hours past their deadlines -- and ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zapatista National Liberation Army had once again delivered what the media 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene the rebels in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas had created for 
the reporters was perfect theater: a jungle backdrop, a cast of villagers 
expectantly lining the dirt road and a chorus of "Vivas" when a voice called 
out, "Viva the Zapatista Army."  
</P>
<P>
 Four crisply uniformed Zapatistas, each carrying a rifle, escorted their 
prisoner, former Chiapas Gov. Absalon Castellanos, toward waiting government 
officials. Castellanos accepted a white-robed bishop's offer of Ash Wednesday 
Holy Communion and as a bonus received the ashes of repentance that accompany 
the sacrament on that day. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels had outmaneuvered Castellanos, who said he had nothing to repent, 
and government officials, who had wanted the prisoner released against the 
background of a new hospital built with federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Such public relations coups have surprised reporters as much as the rebels' 
strategic expertise caught the attention of military observers. In the two 
months since they appeared, taking control of several southern Mexico towns, 
the Zapatistas have demonstrated a mastery of symbolism and image-making worthy 
of Madison Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Their very name evokes the memory of the revolutionary hero most closely 
linked to land reform, Emiliano Zapata, who was murdered at what the government 
had tricked him into believing would be peace talks.  
</P>
<P>
 The rebels have made bandannas and ski masks their trademarks. Their 
wisecracking poetic spokesman, Subcommander Marcos, has become a national hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think the Zapatistas are this cuddly little teddy bear," one 
exasperated government official said recently. The rebels have successfully 
defied efforts to blacken their image. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the fighting, the government accused guerrillas of being influenced 
and financed by foreign mercenaries. They responded by sending a squad of 
young, obviously Indian rebels to the edge of the Zapatista-controlled area and 
bringing reporters up to interview them in small groups.  
</P>
<P>
 Even though the encounters were obviously staged -- several groups of 
journalists crossed paths coming and going -- it satisfied the media's desire 
to film and quote guerrillas, while undermining the government's assertions 
about their origins.  
</P>
<P>
 The Zapatistas even took on Televisa, the broadcast giant, much to the 
amusement of other reporters, who resent the haughty privilege that the network 
usually flaunts. 
</P>
<P>
 Adopting government terms, Televisa reporters described the rebels as 
"transgressors" and lawbreakers. The Zapatistas took revenge by banning the 
network from the nine days of peace talks that ended this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Their mastery of image hit its zenith during those talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Half the delegates appeared in combat gear and the other half in traditional 
Indian dress of heavily embroidered blouses and straw hats with ribbons 
radiating from the peak. At the first press conference, each spoke in an Indian 
language, declaring that theirs is an indigenous, Mexican movement and forcing 
government peace commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis to agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Marcos unfolded and proudly held high a Mexican flag. As cameras began 
clicking, a flustered Camacho Solis -- himself no slouch at imagery -- quickly 
grabbed a corner of the flag. What the Rebels Achieved 
</P>
<P>
 Zapatista rebels in southern Mexico reached a 32-point peace accord with the 
government Wednesday that provids for: 
</P>
<P>
 Subdivision of large ranches in Chiapas state to facilitate more equitable 
land distribution, one of the insurgents' main demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Renovation of the Chiapas state political system to permit more Indian 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
 A new federal law to allow Indians to operate businesses in their own language 
and incorporate their traditions and customs into local laws and courts. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal law prohibiting discrimination against Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 Compensation to Chiapas for the oil and electricity it supplies to parts of 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 A government study of the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement, 
which the rebels oppose, on the Chiapas economy. 
</P>
<P>
 NEXT STEP: The agreement will be presented to Mexico's Congress at its next 
regular session, scheduled for April.

ECONOMICS; A LOFTY GOAL: ENDING INDIA'S WORST POVERTY BY YEAR 2000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The sweating Calcutta rickshaw wallah, the impoverished Bihari sharecropper 
and millions of other Indians struggling to get by were not consulted about it. 
But in the long run, they are meant to be the chief beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing India's 1994-95 budget this week, and disclosing the next moves 
in the government's economic reform game plan, Finance Minister Manmohan Singh 
spoke in detail of tax reform, revenue projections and the need to give 
stagnating industry a helpful push. 
</P>
<P>
 But his first thought, the mild-mannered Oxford Ph.D. said later, was for the 
neediest. 
</P>
<P>
 For only through growth -- enlarging the size of the macroeconomic pie -- can 
the grinding indigence that blights life for countless Indians be eradicated, 
Singh said. 
</P>
<P>
 With sufficient growth, say 6% annually, India can abolish "extreme poverty" 
by the year 2000, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 That rosy forecast, a parting of the ways with the longtime official 
conviction that an end to misery could be engineered by government regulation 
and state planning, sounds much like "trickle-down economics" -- and it is, at 
least of a kind, Singh acknowledged to foreign reporters at a dinner given in 
his honor. 
</P>
<P>
 It's supposed to work this way: 
</P>
<P>
 Indian industry, which grew fat for decades on a domestic market protected 
from outside competitors by high tariff walls, is in the gradual process of 
becoming much freer from government control and more export-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
 As Indian companies find a niche in the global marketplace, that should create 
more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing those entrepreneurs to build a richer India and continuing to court 
foreign investment will produce a broader revenue base to pay for a more secure 
social safety net. That will ignite a "ray of hope" of a better life in a 
nation where yearly income averages $330. 
</P>
<P>
 To coax India's economy into expanding, the former university professor 
announced this week to Parliament that he is ready to take a risk that some 
fellow economists find audacious, even rash. 
</P>
<P>
 Singh wants to spend so much more than the government takes in over the coming 
12 months that the fiscal deficit is projected to hit $17.8 billion, or 6% of 
gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
 His proposed reductions in excise taxes and customs tariffs and breaks on 
corporate and capital-gains taxes that will produce a steep drop in government 
revenue are meant mainly to revive Indian industry, which has been in the 
doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
 Once factories are working full tilt, the hope is that they will import more 
goods and refill government coffers, because about 40% of total revenue comes 
from fees on imports. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher output will also mean greater receipts from excise taxes, and more 
funds to spend on health, education and other basic services. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the essence of what one Calcutta newspaper called Singh's "big 
gamble." 
</P>
<P>
 It all must seem unfathomable to a needy person, for whom the main discernible 
impact of the minister's recent decisions has been an increase in the 
state-controlled price of bottled cooking gas and other staples. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, a leader of the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party called Singh's 
$49-billion budget nothing but a prettily wrapped "sweet of cow dung." 
</P>
<P>
 But parliamentary opponents of the ruling Congress-I Party mostly listened in 
respectful silence to Singh and offered no coherent counter-plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Free marketeers, on the other hand, expected more and were disappointed that 
Singh had not gone further. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics were irked by the willingness of the finance minister, a 
professed apostle of fiscal "rectitude," to spend beyond the government's 
means. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Singh was a full 2.6% off in his 1993-94 calculations of the fiscal 
deficit and the GDP, those critics fear that the government is on the verge of 
losing control over spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending his proposals, which must still be enacted by Parliament, the 
minister stressed that reform in India can only garner continued citizen 
support if it has a "human face" -- meaning that it is slow and in small doses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the right climate, India can surprise itself and the rest of the 
world," he said. "India has the potential to be among the top five or six 
economic players in the world."

VIDEO GAME INDUSTRY VOWS TO DEVELOP RATING SYSTEM; TECHNOLOGY: A SPOKESMAN FOR 
FIRMS TELLS SENATORS THAT STANDARDS WILL BE READY BY CHRISTMAS. THREE RETAILERS 
SAY THEY WON'T STOCK UNRATED TITLES.

<P>
 Leading makers of video games, seeking to avoid government regulation of their 
burgeoning $6-billion industry, pledged Friday to develop an independent rating 
system before next Christmas season in order to warn buyers of violent or 
sexually explicit content not suitable for children. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, officials of three retailers promised to keep unrated games 
off their stores' shelves and to help consumers understand how to use the 
classifications to select products appropriate for youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 The pledges were made at a hearing conducted by Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman 
(D-Conn.) and Herbert Kohl (D-Wis.), co-sponsors of a bill to establish federal 
ratings of video games if the industry does not police itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're making real progress," Lieberman said after the testimony. But he said 
two Senate subcommittees would monitor the industry's actions over the next few 
months and "keep your feet to the fire" to get results. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you rate a game as being OK for kids, and we still find blood and guts on 
the screen, then in my view the rating is meaningless," Lieberman warned before 
the hearing. "If you didn't put blood and gore and sex in the games, you 
wouldn't need to rate the games." 
</P>
<P>
 The viewpoint of the biggest game-makers was articulated by Jack Heistand, an 
official for an interactive entertainment industry rating committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to public outcries and Senate hearings last December that focused on 
such violent games as Mortal Kombat and Night Trap, Heistand said a rating 
system would be developed to advise consumers about the approximately 2,500 
video titles that come on the market each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We strongly believe that it's time to put the game controls in the hands of 
parents and adult consumers through the creation of a universal, responsible, 
reliable, understandable and independent industry ratings system," Heistand 
told a joint hearing of the Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee on 
regulation and the Judiciary subcommittee on juvenile justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have agreed to have a rating system in place by Christmas," he said. 
"Products coming to market after Nov. 1 will, if submitted by publishers in a 
timely fashion, be rated under the new system." 
</P>
<P>
 An independent rating board, acting anonymously, will be established to 
develop guidelines and categories, with symbols designating games intended for 
children and games suitable for teen-agers or adults, he said. Sanctions will 
be imposed on companies that withhold information or secure a rating through 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 But Heistand said the industry -- which began in 1976 when Atari marketed a 
video game called Pong -- is still rapidly changing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Originally, the predominant market for our products was children," he said. 
"But as more sophisticated technology evolves, our market is rapidly attracting 
a more diverse and older audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Atari generation of the 1970s and the Nintendo generation of the 1980s 
have grown up and many young adults are using a wide variety of interactive 
entertainment software products," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voicing support for an industry rating system, officials of Wal-Mart, Toys R 
Us and Babbage's retail stores said they would not stock video games that did 
not carry a rating symbol in the coming holiday season.

NASA HAILS 2ND PERFECT SHUTTLE LAUNCH OF YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The shuttle Columbia soared through a clear sky and slipped into orbit Friday 
with five astronauts who will oversee projects similar to ones planned later 
this decade for a space station. 
</P>
<P>
 "See you in half a month," shuttle commander John Casper told mission control. 
</P>
<P>
 The four men and one woman, all space veterans, began engineering and 
materials experiments and prepared the shuttle robot arm for upcoming magnetic 
tests during the 14-day mission. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA savored the right-on-the-mark launch, the second one this year. Mission 
managers delayed the flight for one day because of dangerously high winds 
Thursday, but the weather was ideal when the sun rose Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was especially gratifying coming after last year's dismal launch record. 
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration struggled through 10 launch 
scrubs in 1993, including two engine shutdowns at the pad. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA's oldest shuttle is making its 16th flight. Columbia already holds the 
record for the longest shuttle excursion -- an hour longer than this scheduled 
13-day, 23-hour voyage -- but crew members are hoping to surpass that with a 
landing delay. One extra orbit on March 18 would do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia holds more engineering and technology experiments than have ever 
flown on a shuttle, a NASA official said. The 11 primary experiments range from 
semiconductor production to metal melting to electric arcing -- the kind of 
work planned for an international space station to be built beginning in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of the major experiments will be operated from the ground. The 
astronauts will occupy themselves with medical tests, a new magnetic grappling 
system for the shuttle robot arm and small, snap-together structures that will 
be shaken to see how the pieces hold up under stress. 
</P>
<P>
 The astronauts will lower Columbia's orbit from the present 184 miles to 120 
miles by flight's end so scientists can see how their experiments fare at 
different altitudes.

 Bosnian government and Croatian delegates opened talks Friday at the U.S. 
Embassy on drafting a constitution for a confederated state planned for their 
people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, which is part of a rapprochement between the allies-turned-enemies, 
is seen as a major step toward peace in Bosnia.

 A framework for the plan was signed by political leaders earlier this week in 
Washington.

POLICE RESTRICT ACCESS TO HOLY SITES IN JERUSALEM; ISRAEL: FEARING REPRISALS 
FOR LAST WEEK'S MASSACRE IN HEBRON, AUTHORITIES CLOSE THE WESTERN WALL. THEY 
ALSO LIMIT ATTENDANCE AT NEARBY MOSQUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unprecedented move, Israeli police on Friday closed the plaza in front 
of Judaism's holiest site -- the Western Wall of the Jews' ancient temple -- 
fearing Palestinians from the neighboring Al Aqsa Mosque would attack Jewish 
worshipers in revenge for the massacre of Muslims at a mosque in Hebron last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The police also sharply restricted access to Al Aqsa, permitting only 
Jerusalemites older than 40 to enter for midday prayers, although Muslims are 
three weeks into the Islamic holy month of Ramadan; fewer than 20,000 people, a 
10th the normal number, were allowed in to pray. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 1,000 police and soldiers saturating Jerusalem's walled Old 
City, surrounding the religious complexes and filling the adjacent maze of 
streets and alleys, the Friday services at Al Aqsa passed peacefully, with no 
repeat of last week's stone-throwing confrontations and the serious casualties 
and deaths that resulted. 
</P>
<P>
 But four Palestinians were reported killed in clashes with Israeli troops and 
settlers elsewhere in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip: 
</P>
<P>
 * Israeli soldiers shot dead two Palestinians in clashes in the Balata refugee 
camp in Nablus, north of Jerusalem, according to Palestinian sources, after 
protests over an apparent attack by Jewish settlers on the camp's outskirts 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian stabbed and wounded two Jewish settlers, 
one of whom then shot the Palestinian dead, Israeli military sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Gaza City, troops killed a man they said had tried to stab one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli authorities had feared violence Friday marking a week since a Jewish 
settler from the community of Kiryat Arba gunned down Muslims -- as many as 48, 
though the precise number is disputed -- while they prayed in a Hebron mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 Clashes continued in the Hebron area Friday. But security forces were deployed 
in increased strength throughout most of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well 
as in Jerusalem, to smother any trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The police actions in limiting access to the Western Wall and Al Aqsa Mosque 
in Jerusalem nonetheless drew sharp criticism, reflecting the religious 
passions woven into the fabric of Arab-Israeli conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Israelis accused Police Commissioner Rafi Peled of yielding to the threat of 
violence and effectively ceding Israeli sovereignty over the Western Wall, 
sometimes called the Wailing Wall. It is believed to be the only remaining 
structure from the temple built by King Herod and destroyed by the Romans. 
Known to Muslims as the Haram al Sharif and to Jews as the Temple Mount, the 
area has long been a focus of Arab-Israeli strife, and Israeli police shot and 
killed 18 Palestinian youths there in 1990 protests. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an embarrassment and a real shame for Israel that we have reached 
such a situation," Rabbi Benny Alon, head of a movement attempting to 
re-establish a Jewish presence throughout the biblical Land of Israel, said 
after police led him away from the wall and closed it for more than an hour. 
"We do not impose sovereignty over the Temple Mount (site now of Al Aqsa), and 
as a result we are afraid of rocks thrown over to the Western Wall. We have 
already conceded the Temple Mount (to the Palestinians), so the Western Wall 
also must be evacuated because it is dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that this was the first time the Western Wall has been blocked off in 
anticipation of violence, Menachem Porush, a member of Parliament from the 
ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism coalition, said it was "inconceivable that 
police allow Muslims into the area while Jews are being evacuated." 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians, on the other hand, complained that the police measures -- a 
tight network of roadblocks around the city, stringent identity checks of 
worshipers wanting to enter the mosque complex, no admission to men younger 
than 40 or from outside Jerusalem -- constituted a serious curtailment of 
freedom of religion and freedom of access to Jerusalem's holy places. 
</P>
<P>
 But Peled justified the moves as having saved lives and kept the peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought the primary interest was to calm (the atmosphere in) the street, 
to calm the Jews and to calm the Muslims," Peled said. "We were determined to 
prevent any deterioration in the situation. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The Western Wall is immediately adjacent to the Temple Mount, with the danger 
that a single stone could cause injuries." The sole person to remain at the 
wall throughout an hour of acute tension was Jerusalem Deputy Mayor Meshulam 
Amit, who said Peled had given "a prize to the supporters of terror" in closing 
approaches to the wall. He showed his commitment to a Jewish Jerusalem by 
remaining at the wall during the hourlong Muslim service.

CLINTON ASSAILS ARREST OF CHINA DISSIDENTS; HUMAN RIGHTS: SOME WESTERN 
DIPLOMATS SEE BEIJING'S ACTION AS A DIRECT SLAP AT THE UNITED STATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton on Friday sharply protested a sudden crackdown on dissidents 
by China, just one week before a planned trip to Beijing by Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
 "We strongly disapprove what was done, and it obviously was not helpful to our 
relations," said Clinton, whose Administration must decide by June whether to 
continue preferential trade status for China. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Administration officials hinted that the crackdown might even prompt the 
cancellation of Christopher's visit. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Chinese police have conducted a roundup of dissidents, including 
the arrest Friday of well-known democracy activist Wei Shingjeng. Wei was 
released today, according to the Reuters news agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But, coming just at the close of a trip to China by John Shattuck, an 
assistant secretary of state and the top U.S. human rights official, the action 
was interpreted by some Western diplomats as a direct slap at the United States 
-- and a new threat to the troubled relationship between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, addressing the issue in a news conference with visiting Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk, said he "wouldn't presume to know what motivated the 
Chinese government." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, "the observance of basic human rights is an important thing to 
us, along with non-proliferation, along with fair trade rules, and that was 
certainly not a helpful action." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials have said they will not renew the trade benefits, 
known as "most favored nation" status, unless China makes significant overall 
progress on human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher has said publicly that, as things stand now, Beijing would not 
qualify for renewal of most-favored status. But other officials have said 
privately in recent days that they believe China could still win the special 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Revocation would drive average tariffs up from the level now of about 8% to 
about 40%. That would jolt businesses and consumers in both economies, since 
the United States receives about one-third of all Chinese exports. 
</P>
<P>
 Wei, who in 14 years in prison became a symbol of China's democracy movement, 
called an associate from Changping county, north of the capital Beijing, to say 
he was free, Reuters reported. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as eight other dissidents were detained this week, including Wang Dan, 
a student leader during the 1989 Tian An Men protests. 
</P>
<P>
 At a State Department briefing, spokeswoman Christine Shelly praised Wei's 
personal courage and commitment to the "nonviolent expression of political 
views." 
</P>
<P>
 "We would look with particular gravity upon any decision by Chinese 
authorities to subject Mr. Wei to additional suffering for the exercise of 
fundamental freedoms recognized by the world community," Shelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 She refused to rule out the possibility that Christopher's scheduled stop in 
Beijing during his visit to Asia might be scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelly said that if reports of the arrests are true, it would be a "setback" 
and "it would represent a most unfortunate setting for Secretary Christopher's 
planned discussions in Beijing." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher left Friday on the Asia trip, which will take him to Hawaii, Japan 
and Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 On the China stop, Christopher is expected to warn that only with greater 
progress on human rights can China hope to continue receiving preferential 
treatment for its billions of dollars in trade with the United States.

U.S. JEOPARDIZING INSPECTION PACT, N. KOREA SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 North Korea accused the United States on Friday of making "ill-boding" moves 
that could threaten an agreement under which Pyongyang will allow international 
inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the agreement reached Thursday, the United States promised to reopen 
high-level talks with the Communist regime and suspend this year's military 
exercises with South Korea in return for the north's allowing the nuclear 
inspections and improving diplomatic contacts with the rival south. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials say the U.S.-North Korea talks and suspension of military 
exercises also depend on an exchange of special envoys between north and south. 
</P>
<P>
 But North Korea's first foreign vice minister, Kang Sok Ju, said the envoy 
exchange was not part of the agreement, which mentioned only renewed talks for 
an exchange and "did not touch on the fulfillment of the exchange." 
</P>
<P>
 Kang said in a statement that "ill-boding moves have been reported one after 
another, giving rise to doubt about the willingness of the United States to 
implement the conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, however, a State Department spokeswoman said Friday that an 
agreement on the exchange of envoys had been put in writing and that the United 
States expects it to be honored. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, which 
North Korea had rejected for over a year, began at the Yongbyon nuclear 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. intelligence officials believe that North Korea already has enough 
weapons-grade plutonium to construct one or more nuclear weapons. The north 
maintains that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.

ROCK SINGER COBAIN IN DRUG COMA; MUSIC: NIRVANA'S LEADER IS HOSPITALIZED IN 
ROME AFTER OVERDOSE. THE BAND'S MANAGER REPORTS SIGNS OF RECOVERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK PHILIPS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kurt Cobain, lead singer for the best-selling rock band Nirvana, was rushed to 
a hospital in Rome early Friday after collapsing into a drug-induced coma. 
</P>
<P>
 The 27-year-old Seattle singer-songwriter -- who has been hailed as a 
"spokesman for his generation" because of the anger and alienation in his music 
-- was comatose throughout the morning but began to show signs of recovery by 
midday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kurt opened his eyes, he moved his fingers, and he responded to his name -- 
those are good signs," Nirvana manager Janet Billig said after speaking by 
phone to Cobain's wife, Courtney Love, who has been at the singer's side since 
calling paramedics to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very serious, but based on what we've been told by the doctors we are 
optimistic that he will make a full recovery," Billig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobain, who canceled concerts Wednesday and Thursday in Germany because of 
illness, overdosed on a mixture of champagne and "painkillers" in a hotel room, 
where he had been recuperating with his wife, who heads the rock group Hole, 
and their 2-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Because so many young rock figures, from Jimi Hendrix to Jim Morrison, have 
died tragically over the years, the rock world braced itself early Friday for 
the worst as sketchy reports of Cobain's overdose surfaced in Italy. Some U.S. 
radio stations even reported that he had died. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the singer has acknowledged taking heroin and other illegal 
substances in the past, Cobain told The Times in late 1992 that the birth of 
his child had caused him to swear off drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want my daughter to grow up and someday be hassled by kids at school. 
. . . I don't want people telling her that her parents were junkies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Billig said the drugs pumped from Cobain's stomach by doctors in the emergency 
room of the Umberto I Polyclinic Hospital were prescribed to fight off 
influenza and a throat condition. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, doctors rarely prescribe anything stronger than antibiotics to 
combat flu. 
</P>
<P>
 But tranquilizers are sometimes given to ease throat problems, medical experts 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italian news agency ANSA said Cobain went into a coma after combining a 
large dose of a strong sedative with champagne. The drug, known in Italy by the 
name Roipnol, is used mostly for insomnia and is not carried by many Italian 
pharmacies. 
</P>
<P>
 Billig said she spoke to Cobain upon his arrival in Rome this week and 
described him as "in great spirits. He was happy to be going to Rome. He feels 
comfortable there and was looking forward to having some time off from the tour 
with his family." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Cobain's songwriting skills and blaring guitar style, Nirvana went 
from underground rock cult status to international stardom in 1991 after the 
release of the group's "Nevermind" album. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection generated more than $120 million in sales worldwide and 
established Nirvana as a force that changed the course of modern rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 The group -- whose latest album, "In Utero," is also a best-seller -- was on a 
European tour, following a highly successful U.S. tour last year that included 
a sold-out date in December at the Forum in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobain was transferred from the public hospital to a private clinic called the 
American Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The singer's mother, Wendy O'Connor, told the Daily World in Aberdeen, Wash., 
that the singer's vital signs were strong and he should recover. "He's going to 
make it," she said.

SINGAPORE DEFENDS AMERICAN TEEN'S FLOGGING SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES P. WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The government here on Friday rejected U.S. criticism of a court's decision to 
sentence an Ohio teen-ager to be flogged for spray-painting cars, saying the 
country's tough laws have saved it from the fate of New York, "where vandalism 
is commonplace." 
</P>
<P>
 The government also rejected foreign pleas for clemency for four foreigners 
who were sentenced to death for drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 A Thai and three Hong Kong nationals were hanged Friday morning at Changi 
Prison, after Amnesty International called on thousands of supporters to send 
appeals for clemency to Singapore President Ong Teng Cheong. Singapore has 
hanged 52 people for drug offenses since the death penalty was imposed in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Another human rights dispute appeared to be brewing in the case of Michael P. 
Fay, the 18-year-old American who was sentenced Thursday to six strokes of a 
cane and four months in prison after pleading guilty to two charges of 
vandalism, two charges of mischief and one count of possessing stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay, of Dayton, Ohio, was freed on $48,000 bail while his attorneys prepared 
an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore said it was "shaken" by Fay's 
sentence. It said it has supported the government's enforcement of law and 
order, which is one reason Singapore is attractive to American business. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, we simply do not understand how the government can condone the 
permanent scarring of any 18-year-old boy -- American or Singaporean -- by 
caning for such an offense," the chamber said in a statement, adding, "It is 
impossible to predict how this will affect American business activity, but it 
is likely to cast a cloud over Singapore's international reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Boyce, the U.S. charge d'affaires who attended the sentencing, took the 
rare step of publicly criticizing the court's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see a large discrepancy between the offense and the punishment," Boyce 
said. "The cars were not permanently damaged; the paint was removed with 
thinner. Caning leaves permanent scars. In addition, the accused is a teen-ager 
and this is his first offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Fay is believed to be the first American ever sentenced to a caning, in which 
a trained martial arts expert flogs a prisoner with a half-inch-thick rattan 
cane. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike some other societies which may tolerate acts of vandalism, Singapore 
has its own standards of social order as reflected in our laws," the Ministry 
of Home Affairs said in a statement. "It is because of our tough laws against 
anti-social crimes that we are able to keep Singapore orderly and relatively 
crime free. We do not have a situation where acts of vandalism are commonplace 
as in cities like New York, where even police cars are not spared the acts of 
vandals." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement said that in the last five years, 14 people, ages 18 to 21, had 
been sentenced to imprisonment and caning for vandalism, including two 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Singapore expects its citizens to follow the laws of the countries they visit 
or reside in. Similarly, we also expect foreigners in Singapore to abide by our 
laws," the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Americans who live in Singapore said privately that they believe that 
the government attached great importance to the Fay case in order to send a 
message to Singaporeans about the dangers of "decadent" Western culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore is a longtime ally of the United States, linked by expanding trade 
and security ties. The United States operates a facility for U.S. Navy ships in 
Singapore, and there are more than 200 U.S service personnel based here. 
</P>
<P>
 But the relationship has had its up and downs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, an American diplomat was expelled for interfering in Singapore's 
domestic affairs by speaking to opposition politicians. The government has also 
barred a number of American journalists from attending international 
conferences here, despite the objections of the U.S. secretary of state.

CLINTON SHOWS CONFIDENCE IN UKRAINE'S ARMS EFFORTS; WEAPONS: PRESIDENT USES THE 
CARROT APPROACH TO PROD THE FORMER SOVIET REPUBLIC INTO GIVING UP ITS NUCLEAR 
MISSILES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton said Friday that he is "personally well-satisfied" with 
Ukraine's progress toward dismantling former Soviet nuclear weapons still on 
its territory, despite mixed assessments by government and private analysts on 
how much has been done. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference with visiting Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, 
Clinton expressed confidence that the Ukrainian Parliament will ratify the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, as Kravchuk has pledged. 
</P>
<P>
 His comments came as the Administration went all out to put the best face on 
U.S. relations with Ukraine in hopes of encouraging Kravchuk and his government 
to move more quickly on the nuclear weapons issue and to make market-oriented 
reforms in Ukraine's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Clinton announced that the United States would more than double 
its previous $330 million in annual aid to Ukraine to $700 million; half will 
go to help finance the transfer and dismantling of nuclear weapons and half for 
general economic assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Kravchuk's visit was something of a victory for the Ukrainian president, who 
had been pressing to come to Washington for months. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been rebuffed until he signed an accord on dismantling the remaining 
Soviet missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 He brought along figure skaters Oksana Baiul, the waif-like 16-year-old girl 
who won an Olympic gold medal last week, and 1992 men's Olympic gold medalist 
Viktor Petrenko. The two athletes toured the White House and shook hands with 
Clinton at the meeting's end. 
</P>
<P>
 As well as the increased economic aid, the White House unveiled additional 
benefits, from new investment and tax treaties with Ukraine to support for the 
country's application for membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House said it also is reducing U.S. tariffs on a variety of 
Ukrainian goods under the Generalized System of Preferences, a trade program 
often used to benefit developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials have expressed fear that Ukraine would become a major 
geopolitical threat if it did not agree to return or dismantle the remaining 
Soviet warheads. With 1,600 nuclear warheads, it is the third-largest nuclear 
power, behind the United States and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the accord, signed in January, Ukraine has pledged to dismantle the 
Soviet missiles or return them to Russia for destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been conflicting reports about just how many nuclear warheads 
Ukraine actually has sent back to Russia, but analysts said that despite 
Clinton's comments Friday, the progress has been modest. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the country is eligible for up to $1.2 billion in U.S. aid to help 
pay for dismantling the nuclear weapons, it so far has qualified for only about 
$150 million; U.S. officials, however, said they expect Ukraine to accelerate 
its program. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukrainian lawmakers have already failed once to ratify the non-proliferation 
treaty, another major part of the accord. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kravchuk insisted Friday that it would do so after March 27 parliamentary 
elections. He said that lawmakers are out campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine has also done virtually nothing to move away from the kind of 
state-run economy that prevailed when the Communists were in power. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said they hope that the aid Washington promised Friday will 
help push the country toward making some reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Kravchuk himself made the most of Friday's ceremonies, asserting that his 
meeting with Clinton "can be without exaggeration called a historic moment in 
(the) relationship between our two states."

RUSSIAN BUDGET SEEKS TO BALANCE FISCAL REFORMS, STABILITY; ECONOMY: WITH 
AVERAGE CITIZEN'S LOT RAPIDLY DECLINING, YELTSIN TAKES NOTE OF HARDSHIPS. 
NONETHELESS, HE FACES A TOUGH FIGHT IN PARLIAMENT.

<P>
 Russia's leaders unveiled a draft budget Friday that aims to halt the plummet 
in living standards and production while bringing inflation to less than 10% by 
the end of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "Democracy in Russia today means primarily stability, order and cooperation," 
President Boris N. Yeltsin said as he embarked on what is bound to be an 
especially fractious budget season. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia cannot afford "reform at any cost," Yeltsin told government leaders 
summoned to a budget conference in the Kremlin's Marble Hall. "People may 
reject reform if it involves too many hardships." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he warned that delaying essential reforms could cause still 
more hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, striking a similarly centrist tone, 
called for strengthening the state and imposing more control on the 
free-for-all in Russia's semi-socialist, semi-anarchic economy. He also 
insisted that the economic reform program, laid out in August, 1993, under the 
stewardship of ousted Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, would be achieved, 
although by different means. 
</P>
<P>
 By every measure, the government's task remains daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 27 months since Russia decontrolled them, consumer prices have jumped 
245 times while real income after inflation has decreased by 43%, according to 
government statistics released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 results are only slightly less painful: The average monthly income 
jumped 3.5 times, but prices rose 9.4 times. 
</P>
<P>
 The average Russian's monthly income is now $114. But prices for many goods 
now equal or exceed world levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the gap between rich and poor -- a very sensitive social indicator 
in a country that views gross income disparity as deeply immoral -- has 
widened. 
</P>
<P>
 The richest 10% of Russians earn 11 times more than the poorest 10%, the 
Economics Ministry reported. By contrast, the richest 10% of Americans in 1992 
earned 63 times what the poorest 10% earned, according to the U.S. Census 
Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 To ease the pain, Yeltsin promised that the government this month will pay the 
billions of rubles in back wages it owes workers, some of whom have gone six 
months without a paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 Coal miners have threatened to strike unless the government pays up, farmers 
say they will not sow spring crops unless they are paid for the grain they 
delivered last September, and the deadbeat state has become a serious political 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin also called for banking reform, anti-monopoly measures, an urgent 
government plan to break the gridlock of mutual debt that has paralyzed Russian 
industry and the introduction of a bankruptcy procedure that would help dying 
enterprises restructure. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 40-minute speech, Chernomyrdin argued that the country could withstand 
neither hyper-inflation nor a massive shutdown of factories and other 
institutions that would lead to social chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 He said strict monetary measures to curb inflation must be accompanied by 
efforts to stimulate investment and production. In some industries, he said, 
production is less than half of its January, 1990, level, contributing to a 
deepening recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Chernomyrdin said the privatization program would continue. But the 
government's priority would shift from merely promoting an unstructured selloff 
of state property to trying to make the newly privatized enterprises productive 
and competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Tipping his hat to nationalists, who have warned that Russia is fast becoming 
a Third World supplier of raw materials to a rapacious West, Chernomyrdin 
warned that "we are being led toward a weaker Russia" and promised that he will 
not allow the country to be turned into "a raw materials appendage." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Chernomyrdin said there will be no dramatic change in course. 
</P>
<P>
 "The country, the reforms and all of us are different from what we were one or 
two years ago," he said. "A market economy already exists in Russia. We should 
now move ahead, not retreat." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 draft budget for state expenditures is $107.5 billion. It forecasts 
revenue of $71.2 billion, for a deficit of $36.3 billion, or slightly more than 
10% of Russia's gross national product. This is virtually unchanged from last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin appealed to Parliament for cooperation in 
improving Russia's worsening economic plight. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin and his prime minister made it clear that Parliament will be held 
responsible if it rejects his plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But even before the draft budget arrived in the Duma, or the lower house of 
Parliament, key legislative and military leaders criticized it, setting the 
stage for renewed political conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 First Deputy Defense Minister Andrei Kokoshin complained that the budget will 
result in the "collapse of key defense industries and will negatively impact 
the fate of 15 million people." 
</P>
<P>
 The draft budget allocates $21.9 billion for defense, Russia's Itar-Tass news 
agency reported. The U.S. defense budget for 1995 is $252 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, who controls the second-largest 
voting bloc in Parliament, said the budget will not help the Russian people. 
</P>
<P>
 But ironically, Parliament's Communist Party leader, Gennady A. Zyuganov, 
praised the budget, noting that it made important provisions for "state 
regulation and state support." 
</P>
<P>
 "At least this is a rather serious attempt to move away from shock reform in 
favor of creative reform," Zyuganov said.

FOES CHALLENGE ANTIGUA'S DYNASTY; CARIBBEAN: TAINTED BY CHARGES OF CORRUPTION, 
THE BIRD FAMILY MAY FIND ITS GRIP ON POWER LOOSENED BY ELECTIONS NEXT WEEK. 
</P>

 A visitor to the office of Antigua's likely new prime minister encounters a 
stench arising from a gutter carrying raw sewage past the building. To many 
Antiguans, the odor symbolizes the state of their nation's politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "You noticed the smell, did you?" asked a prominent St. John's businessman who 
has a shop near the politician's office. "Get used to it. The whole island 
stinks of (it) and so does the way politics are run here and so does that 
politician across the street." 
</P>
<P>
 He sneered when he said "that politician." 
</P>
<P>
 "That politician" is Lester Bird, a 55-year-old U.S. citizen who at times 
seems minister of nearly everything, not to mention owner of, or investor in, 
many of Antigua's most important businesses and development projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his titles are minister of trade and commerce, minister of foreign 
affairs and self-proclaimed deputy prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 He owns or controls the island's two sand and gravel mining firms and has 
major holdings in other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 But most important, he is son of Vere Cornwall Bird, the last of the giants 
who led the British Caribbean nations to independence earlier in the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Lester, as the graduate of the University of Michigan is universally called on 
this 112-square-mile island nation, will lead his father's Antigua Labor Party 
to national elections Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 It will be the first time since Antigua was granted limited self-government by 
the British in the mid-1950s that V.C. Bird will not head the party or lead it 
in elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, when he steps down after the elections, it will be the first time in 
50 years that Bird, 84, will not be Antigua's leader, except for 1971-76, when 
his party was out of office. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Antigua Labor Party is considered likely to win most of the seats in 
the tiny national legislature, most political experts say its current 16-1 
domination will be reduced considerably, probably to a five- or six-seat edge. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition, the United Progressive Party, is running a full slate of 
candidates for the first time in several elections. It has chosen as its head a 
highly respected labor leader, Baldwin Spencer, known for his honesty and 
conciliatory style. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Spencer and Tim Hector, who is a Progressive Party candidate and 
the editor of Antigua's crusading weekly newspaper, the Outlet, their main 
campaign tactic will be to take advantage of what they say is an overwhelming 
public sense of revulsion against half a century of Bird rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been nothing like it outside of Haiti," said Hector, 53, a former 
Bird protege, referring to the Duvaliers, father and son, who ruled that nation 
from 1957 until 1986. "In the past, the Birds were unstoppable; people just 
accepted that the old man and his family could do what they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now it is just too much. All of them, including V.C., have been branded 
by outside sources as corrupt, and that corruption has put the country deeply 
in debt and deprived the people of what they know they should have." 
</P>
<P>
 Hector, who is widely admired here for his thorough investigative reporting, 
is a fervent anti-Bird partisan, and his judgments have to be seen in that 
light. There are many experts who believe that in the end a majority of voters 
will go with the son of the man still called "popa" and the "father of our 
independence." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a question of how the people judge the last 50 years," said 
a diplomat with close ties to both parties. 
</P>
<P>
 There is much to balance. It has been half a century of strong economic 
growth. Antigua has one of the region's highest per capita incomes. But it also 
has one of the world's highest per capita debts, about $400 million for a 
country of 60,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 But more important in the minds of many diplomats, investigating jurists and 
other experts, the Bird era has been a time of political dynasty and 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Dynasty it certainly is. In addition to V.C. and Lester, there is Vere Bird 
Jr., who has played an important and highly visible role in Antiguan politics 
over the last 25 years, winning elections by huge margins. In fact, Vere Jr., 
the eldest son, was the one most observers thought likeliest to take his 
father's place. 
</P>
<P>
 Except that Vere Jr. made a few mistakes. Among other things, he had roles in 
a 1989 gun-running scheme involving the sale of arms to Colombian drug dealers; 
establishment of a terrorist training school for the Colombians, and an 
$11-million airport construction scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this led to an investigation conducted by a British jurist, Louis 
Blom-Cooper, whose report attacked the entire Bird government for "unbridled 
corruption . . . (and) the failure of the government to observe the rule of 
law." 
</P>
<P>
 Calling Vere Jr. "thoroughly unprincipled . . . mendacious," the judge 
expressed the hope that he "become both politically and socially an outcast in 
Antigua." He recommended that Vere Jr. never be allowed to serve in the 
Cabinet.  
</P>
<P>
 While the Birds had a reputation of public unity in the face of criticism, the 
scandals that accumulated around Vere Jr. were too much. He was forced from the 
head of the succession line, replaced by Lester. 
</P>
<P>
 Some supporters of both V.C. and Vere Jr. say Lester kicked his brother when 
he was down by resigning his Cabinet jobs in 1991, supposedly to protest what 
had been going on. 
</P>
<P>
 When he left, Lester said he would not return until the government had been 
cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
 In what Hector said was Lester's biggest political mistake, he relented after 
a few months and asked his father to reinstate him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He went back in," Hector said, "even though there were no changes, neither in 
the government, the party nor in the corruption. I thought he had turned over a 
new leaf, but it was just the same old business." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources other than Hector say links between Lester's own businesses and his 
government role are more than suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, he owns the Sand Co. of Antigua and Antigua Aggregates, both 
involved in mining sand and gravel. Among their major customers is the 
government of Antigua, particularly the Ministry of Trade and Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Lester's position has been so strong that in January he ignored a court 
injunction to stop mining sand from the neighboring island of Barbuda because 
of environmental damage. Hector estimates that the Bird companies made close to 
$10 million while he thumbed his nose at the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Lester was also instrumental in allowing the American fugitive financier 
Robert Vesco to stay in Antigua. 
</P>
<P>
 Lester was involved in building what was supposed to be a government-owned 
hotel with money lent to Antigua by foreign governments. As it turned out, 
Lester was the secret owner of the hotel, and the loans were never repaid. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, all the Birds have refused to meet with foreign journalists. 
One associate of Lester said there would be no interviews until after the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Lester himself is campaigning on an anti-corruption platform, saying it is 
time to end the old ways of politics and government business.

WARNING ISSUED FOR AMERICANS TRAVELING IN ISLAMIC COUNTRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The State Department warned Americans on Friday to exercise extreme caution 
when traveling in Islamic countries because of the danger of retaliation 
related to the conviction of four Muslim militants in the World Trade Center 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokeswoman Christine Shelly said that the court decision may cause Muslim 
extremists to seek revenge against Americans, including tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conviction of the followers of Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman in the World Trade 
Center bombing trial in New York may precipitate strong reactions from Islamic 
extremists in Egypt, including possible attacks against U.S. citizens and 
interests," Shelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that the department has no information about specific threats but 
said that "Americans overseas, especially those living or traveling throughout 
the Middle East, South Asia and North Africa, should be alert to continuing 
developments." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton congratulated law enforcement agencies and the prosecution 
after the verdict was returned. "I think that the signal should go out across 
the world that anyone who seeks to come to this country to practice terrorism 
will have the full weight of the law enforcement authorities against them."

GUNMEN ATTACK ITALIAN EMBASSY IN SOMALIA

<TEXT>
<P>
 Up to 30 Somali gunmen attacked the Italian Embassy in northern Mogadishu on 
Friday, and soldiers inside killed at least one Somali when they returned fire, 
military officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians drove off two assaults by the gunmen, who vanished when U.S. and 
Italian helicopters took to the skies. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian Lt. Col. Gianfranco Scalas, who said a second Somali was wounded, 
speculated that the Somalis were trying to loot the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
 Somali witnesses said the attack was the work of former embassy employees who 
were disgruntled over their final pay.

COUPLE SUES OVER ROOM SERVICE AT PARK: PREACHING TO THE NAKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A couple has sued the government, saying that a lodge employee at Big Bend 
National Park in Texas walked into their room while they lay in bed unclothed 
and invited them to a Christian service. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl and Rita Girshman asked a federal judge here Thursday to order the 
National Park Service to back away from what they contend is an improper 
relationship with Christian Ministry, a group that has been holding worship 
services at dozens of national parks for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brookeville, Md., couple accused parks officials of endorsing and 
supporting the ministry, permitting the group to advertise and conduct 
religious services without permits, providing rent-free or subsidized housing 
to the group's staff and reserving park service jobs for the group's ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 Park service spokesman John Quinley declined comment, saying the agency had 
not seen the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving a written complaint from the Girshmans, who are Jewish, the 
park service maintained that it does not directly or indirectly support the 
ministry's activities, said the couple's attorney, Thomas Starnes. 
</P>
<P>
 In their suit, the Girshmans claimed that the park service uses government 
parks, money, employees and prestige to advance a religion in violation of the 
Constitution's separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
 Named as defendants were Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and park service 
Director Roger Kennedy. No money damages were demanded, but the couple is 
seeking to have the defendants pay attorney's fees and costs, Starnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the New York-based Christian Ministry said the couple's 
allegations are not true. 
</P>
<P>
 Group staff who are employed by the park system do not try to convert people 
while on the job, and the park service has nothing to do with the governance of 
the ministry, director Warren Ost said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission is to give people an opportunity to worship while they are in the 
national parks if they wish and to allow them to do so with leadership that is 
well organized and has some background," Ost said. 
</P>
<P>
 In their lawsuit, the Girshmans said they were undressed in their room at 
Chisos Mountain Lodge at Big Bend on March 4, 1992, when they were startled by 
an intruder. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, an employee of National Park Concessionaires Inc. -- the company 
under government contract to run the lodge -- walked into their room without 
permission, the suit said. He was carrying a leaflet bearing an arrowhead logo 
similar to the National Park Service logo and encouraging them "To Join in 
Worshipping Our Lord and Savior" at two amphitheaters in the park, the couple 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 National Park Concessionaires eventually agreed to pay the couple money as 
part of a deal to resolve their complaints out of court, Starnes said. He 
declined to say how much they received.

 A courier employed by the Rose Law Firm acknowledged Friday that he shredded 
documents belonging to late White House counsel Vincent Foster in January, a 
few weeks before the firm received a broadly worded subpoena for documents from 
Whitewater special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton Lindsey, 19, of Little Rock, told The Times that both he and his 
roommate, Jeremy Hedges, also a courier at the law firm, were instructed to 
destroy the papers. He declined to describe the contents of the documents but 
said they could have been internal materials, as spokesmen for the firm have 
suggested, rather than files related to the Whitewater controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey testified about the shredding to a federal grand jury on Feb. 16. His 
and Hedges' testimony apparently led Fiske to issue the subpoena to the law 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers at the firm, where Foster practiced law before January, 1993, along 
with now-First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and two current Administration 
officials, do not deny that some documents belonging to Foster were shredded, 
but they have maintained that they never destroyed any materials that might be 
pertinent to Fiske's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of the shredding, which first appeared in the Washington Times and the 
New York Times, added to the many difficulties that the law firm -- reputed to 
be the oldest west of the Mississippi River -- has encountered since it came 
under scrutiny as a result of its involvement in the Whitewater controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few weeks, the firm's lawyers have been forced to respond to 
allegations of conflict of interest, overbilling and destroying evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske is looking into allegations that President Clinton may have benefited 
improperly from his association with James B. McDougal, owner of a failed 
savings and loan and partner with the Clintons in a real estate development 
firm known as Whitewater Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the inquiry centers on Whitewater, Fiske is also investigating the 
apparent suicide of Foster last summer. His investigation also is looking at 
the role played by Hillary Clinton and her firm in representing Whitewater and 
McDougal's Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the couriers' story, a spokesman for the law firm has 
acknowledged that some files belonging to Foster were found earlier this year 
when one lawyer was moving to a new office. 
</P>
<P>
 He said those documents were discarded because they were nothing more than 
"internal Rose firm materials," such as notes of committee meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey, a college student who works part time at the law firm, said the 
documents he and Hedges shredded were plainly marked as belonging to Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 After the couriers testified, Fiske sent a subpoena to the firm warning 
against the shredding or destruction of documents. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the subpoena was characterized by Rose lawyers as "extremely 
broadly worded," but it is not known if discarded committee meeting notes and 
other internal documents would have been covered. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Fiske declined to discuss the subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
 A special grand jury is expected to be impaneled later this month to begin 
hearing testimony in the Whitewater matter. The couriers appeared before a 
regular grand jury, which sat three days last month to hear a variety of 
preliminary matters related to Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews with The Times over the last month, several Rose Law Firm 
partners have strongly denied reports that the firm ever shredded any documents 
related to Whitewater, which would be a criminal act. Even before the subpoena 
was received, the firm's lawyers were ethically bound to preserve evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "You think if we were going to shred some documents from Madison and 
Whitewater, we would call in some clerks and say: 'Here, we are going to shred 
Whitewater documents?' " asked Alan Bird, who represents the firm in 
Washington. "And do you think we would do it in the middle of the day?" 
</P>
<P>
 Many law firms routinely destroy confidential documents that are no longer 
needed. According to Rose partners, their firm did not own a shredder until 
1992, when one was purchased in response to indications that news reporters 
covering the Clinton presidential campaign were foraging through the firm's 
trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey said he and Hedges testified before the grand jury with the knowledge 
and approval of their employer, but they hired a lawyer from another firm to 
accompany them into the grand jury room. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his testimony has done nothing to undermine his employment at the 
firm, where he runs errands and does other tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedges was working at the firm on Friday and could not be reached. 
</P>

STERILIZATION OF MOTHER WITH LOW IQ ORDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge agreed to order the sterilization of a mentally impaired woman who 
asked for the procedure because she has been pregnant three times in less than 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22-year-old, whose name was withheld by the court, is due to give birth in 
a week.She has a 9-month-old who is being cared for by her parents. A 
miscarriage ended another pregnancy last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Erie County Surrogate Judge Joseph Mattina signed the order Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three different men got the woman pregnant, court officials said. The woman 
has an IQ of 70, making her developmentally disabled. An IQ of 100 is 
considered average. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's parents, who want her sterilized, went to court because she is not 
considered legally competent to make the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing Thursday, the woman told Mattina that men have taken advantage of 
her sexually and that she wants the sterilization because she "can't find the 
right man." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of jerks out there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Court-appointed attorneys for the woman said they would challenge Mattina's 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher court rulings have permitted judges to order sterilizations only when 
pregnancy might put a woman's life or health in jeopardy, one of her attorneys, 
Herbert Siegel, said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Susan Gray, an attorney hired by the woman's family, said the woman cannot 
control her sexual behavior and that sterilization is the only way to prevent 
her from getting pregnant.

SPEED GAUGE FAULTY ON JET THAT SKIDDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The airspeed indicator on the jet that skidded off a snow-slick La Guardia 
Airport runway was not working properly during the aborted takeoff, a National 
Transportation Safety Board official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 An examination of the jet's flight data recorder revealed the plane's airspeed 
indicator was "out of whack" with other data from the recorder, said Susan 
Coughlin, NTSB vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-five of the 116 people aboard the Denver-bound Continental Airlines 
MD-80 were injured Wednesday when the pilot aborted the takeoff and the plane 
ran off the end of the runway. It nosed down at a breakwater a few feet from 
Flushing Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental Airlines said its pilot applied the brakes when his instruments 
indicated he could not reach takeoff speed of about 161 m.p.h. The plane used 
up all of the runway and overrun space to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 The jet's engines were developing normal power but the airspeed indicator did 
not show it, Coughlin said.

ACCUSED KILLER OF DOCTOR SOBS AT TRIAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man accused of murdering an abortion doctor broke into tears Friday as a 
fellow anti-abortion activist described to a jury graphic videotapes and a 
5-foot-tall effigy of the slain physician. 
</P>
<P>
 Sobbing and wiping his eyes, Michael F. Griffin was taken from the courtroom 
for a break after witness John Burt talked of the effigy of Dr. David Gunn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a doctor that had rubber gloves on," Burt said. "Maybe the gloves had 
red paint splattered on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin is accused of shooting Gunn three times as he arrived for work at 
Pensacola Women's Medical Services during a protest led by Burt nearly a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecution witnesses said Griffin was the gunman. Griffin's attorneys said 
videotapes of abortions, aborted fetuses in jars and even the effigy could have 
upset Griffin to the point of violence.

FIRST LADY SAYS NEWS VIOLENCE HARMS YOUNG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on Friday called on the news media to use 
more positive images of people, saying that children cannot protect themselves 
from increasing sensationalism and violence on the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children can't cope with much of what they see" on television, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A steady diet of stories about children being murdered or priests who molest 
children tends to desensitize young viewers and "prevent them from developing 
emotionally and psychologically," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 News stories also tend to reinforce stereotypes of minorities as criminals and 
women as victims, she said. The First Lady spoke by satellite to about 120 
journalists, academics and children's advocates gathered here for a conference 
on children and the news media, sponsored by Children Now, a California-based 
advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, the group released a study showing that news stories about 
children are dominated by crime and violence. A separate national survey of 
children 11 to 17 found that 65% watched television news and half were left 
feeling "angry, sad and depressed." 
</P>
<P>
 The conference was called to pressure the news media to change, according to 
Jim Steyer, president of Children Now. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Lady noted that violence levels are dropping in entertainment media 
and that voluntary monitoring of television programs is a "step in the right 
direction."  
</P>
<P>
 She acknowledged that public awareness of violence has helped heighten support 
for deterrents, including proposed crime legislation in Congress. But, she 
said, "there must be a balance when it comes to children."  
</P>
<P>
 Conference panelist Van Gordon Sauter, president of Fox News, acknowledged 
that children's helplessness makes them unique. But, he said, "we can't create 
programs for a mass audience through the prism of 13-year-olds." It would be 
"commercially disastrous" to tailor news to please elements of society so they 
will not be frightened, he said. He suggested that children watch news programs 
made for them such as CNN's "Real News." 
</P>
<P>
 Other panelists, including ABC's Carole Simpson and Linda Ellerbee, producer 
of the Nickelodeon cable channel's "Nick News" for children, disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
 Newton Minow, former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said:  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the media has become the major educational institution in America, 
more than schools, more than universities. I think the media has to redefine 
itself as teachers."

UNITY ON HEALTH PLAN ELUDES SENATE GOP; REFORM: REPUBLICANS ARE SPLIT ON 
WHETHER SYSTEM NEEDS COMPLETE OVERHAUL OR ONLY MINOR ADJUSTMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Senate Republicans, hoping to capitalize on the apparently fading fortunes of 
President Clinton's health plan, tried to close divisions within their ranks 
but emerged Friday from a two-day retreat here apparently no closer to 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said the 36 Republicans who attended 
the meeting were united in their common goal to make "health care affordable 
for all Americans and accessible for all Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 However, they remain at odds over whether that requires a total overhaul of 
the U.S. health care system and a guarantee of coverage for all, as some of 
them argue, or whether it can be accomplished, as others say, by correcting a 
few critical flaws in the current arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton hopes that the bloc of Republicans favoring more sweeping change will 
remain intact, because it offers him a chance of winning at least some GOP 
votes for whatever version of his plan emerges from the Democratic-controlled 
committees in the House and Senate. The first of those panels, the House Ways 
and Means health subcommittee, is scheduled to begin its work next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Also attending the session were three GOP governors and a handful of House 
members, as well as several Republican political consultants, pollsters and 
lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), the second-ranking House Republican, said that the 
disarray among Democrats, coupled with the Republicans' intent to be involved 
in the issue, could open a rare opportunity for the two parties to work 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's much more desire to write a bipartisan bill than I had expected," 
said Gingrich, who is generally among the most partisan and combative 
Republicans. "I think in the next week, you'll see us reach out to the 
Democrats." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans are heartened by recent polls that indicate growing public 
uneasiness over the Clinton plan -- a fear that most Americans will pay higher 
premiums for lower-quality care. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the GOP legislators seem to believe that they must do more than 
simply oppose the Clinton plan. Such a strategy would raise the risk that 
Americans would view their party as simply obstructionist and not sensitive to 
the hardships of the current health system. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, where their 44 votes are enough to block most legislation, the 
Republicans are likely to be able to influence the shape of any health bill 
that emerges. That is particularly true because the Democrats are so deeply 
split on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Different factions within the GOP have advanced widely divergent options -- 
ranging from the sweeping alternative proposed by moderate Sen. John H. Chafee 
(R-R.I.) that would achieve universal coverage by requiring individuals to have 
coverage, to the minimalist plan of staunchly conservative Sen. Phil Gramm 
(R-Tex.) that emphasizes health care savings accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's more of a possibility of us getting together than I 
originally would have thought," Chafee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made progress here," Gramm agreed. "We all recognize the President's 
health care plan is dead, because the American people rejected it." 
</P>
<P>
 However, when pressed to cite areas where they had reached agreement where 
none had existed before, the participants in the meeting offered no specifics.

NEW QUAKE MAPS SHOW HEAVY SHAKING FAR FROM EPICENTER; SEISMOLOGY: MERCALLI 
SCALE, BASED ON INTERVIEWS, REVEALS A WIDESPREAD, IRREGULAR PATTERN OF THE 
NORTHRIDGE TEMBLOR'S EFFECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most definitive maps on the Northridge earthquake yet released by official 
sources show that comparatively heavy shaking was experienced far from the 
epicenter of the earthquake and in the same irregular patterns found closer in. 
</P>
<P>
 The maps from the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., use 
the Mercalli scale -- which is based on interviews and damage observations -- 
to show how severely the quake was felt in Southern California and Nevada. The 
Mercalli scale uses Roman numerals from I to XII to express shaking intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 Some level V shaking -- described as capable of causing minor, mostly 
non-structural damage -- occurred in the Imperial Valley, Santa Maria, Fresno 
and Laughlin, Nev., as far as 200 miles from the Northridge epicenter.  
</P>
<P>
 The maps also show that the intensity of the shaking was lower in some places 
closer to the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley and other parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties 
where heavy damage occurred, the intensity level reached IX. The worst shaking 
occurred in parts of Northridge, Reseda, the Newhall Pass, Sherman Oaks, Santa 
Monica and the West Adams district of Los Angeles, the maps show. 
</P>
<P>
 Other areas subject to higher shaking than nearby communities included 
Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach and, in Ventura County, Oxnard 
and Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 The maps are preliminary and subject to change, cautioned Jim Dewey, the 
research geophysicist who coordinated the project for the Earthquake 
Information Center, a branch of the U.S. Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
 They are based on 4,000 telephone interviews conducted by a polling team at 
Humboldt State University and 700 mail inquiries by the Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the single magnitude reading, which is used to characterize an entire 
earthquake -- 6.8 in the case of the Jan. 17 Northridge quake -- Mercalli 
scales give a picture of a quake as it was felt in various areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The scale -- used to describe how people felt a quake, how frightened they 
were and what damage was sustained -- was developed by Italian seismologist 
Giuseppi Mercalli in 1902. Its definitions were modified by American 
seismologists Harry Wood and Frank Neumann in 1931. 
</P>
<P>
 In areas of level IX shaking, for instance, the definitions say there is 
general panic, spectacular partial collapses of modern buildings, widespread 
destruction of wood-frame apartments and collapses of elevated highways. All of 
these phenomena have been verified by the telephone and mail surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Dengler, the Humboldt State earthquake scientist who has been 
coordinating the telephone survey, said about 20 interviews averaging five 
minutes each were conducted in each Southland community sampled. 
</P>
<P>
 She released information on Friday showing that 100% of those surveyed in Los 
Angeles, Santa Monica, Palmdale, Long Beach, Ventura and Barstow said they were 
awakened by the Northridge quake at 4:31 a.m. Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica, 79% of residents sampled said they had suffered damage in 
their households. The damage figure was 19% in Long Beach, 20% in Ventura, 14% 
in Pomona and 20% in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 In Las Vegas, 36% of residents sampled said they had been awakened by the 
earthquake and 3% said that some items had fallen off shelves. In San Diego, 
60% of the sample said they had been awakened and 2% reported damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Dengler said tables have yet to be developed for the San Fernando Valley, 
where telephone interviewing will continue this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Dewey, at the Earthquake Information Center, said that reactions to the 
telephone calls and the mail inquiries contain "a strong component of 
individual perception" and that the Mercalli scale is therefore subjective. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we ask a bunch of questions of the person who's responding," he added. 
"How they perceived the quake, whether they were awakened or frightened, 
whether they had difficulty in maintaining balance or walking and how they 
would qualitatively describe the shaking, whether light, moderate or strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaking was higher near the epicenters of past earthquakes in the Yucca 
Valley, the Tehachapi Mountains and along the potentially dangerous San Jacinto 
fault near Hemet. "It wouldn't be a single previous quake," he explained. "It 
would be faults that have been active for millions of years." 
</P>
<P>
 It is also possible that people living near the sites of big quakes, like the 
Landers earthquake, might be more sensitive to ground movement and inclined to 
perceive the shaking from Northridge in different terms, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 While Dewey said he considers what has been obtained from the survey "a pretty 
good sample," he added that the interviews and questionnaires will go on for 
some time. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government has been collecting information about significant 
earthquakes for Mercalli maps since 1928, "and, in fact, one of the values of 
the intensity data is that it provides a means of comparing earthquakes of the 
present day, for which we have instrumental data, with earthquakes that 
occurred before present instruments were developed," Dewey said. Patterns of 
Destruction 
</P>
<P>
 One of the intriguing characteristics of the Jan. 17 quake was the irregular 
pattern of damage. The Mercalli scale measures shaking intensity based on 
accounts of eyewitnesses who classify local damage according to levels detailed 
below. These preliminary scales, showing the damage it did throughout Southern 
California and parts of southern Nevada, demonstrate that such areas as the 
Imperial Valley, Laughlin, Nev., and towns close to Fresno and Santa Maria had 
considerably more shaking than other nearby places. There also appears to have 
been somewhat higher than average shaking in the vicinity of previous big 
quakes, such as the 1992 Landers temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 II-IV: Intensity II is felt indoors by a few people, especially on upper 
floors. III is felt by some people as a rapid vibration. IV is felt indoors by 
many, outdoors by few. Vibration like that of a heavy truck passing. Frightens 
no one. 
</P>
<P>
 V: Frightens a few. A few small objects overturned and fallen; a few items 
thrown from store shelves; hairline cracks in interior walls; a few cracked 
windows, respondents report difficulty in standing up, walking or maintaining 
balance.

 Although California is renowned for seismic drama, its fractured geology 
actually tends to limit the scope of earth movement in a big quake, as crustal 
cracks dampen the shock waves. That is not the case in the ore solid eastern

LOSING GROUND; CAL STATE FULLERTON CONFERENCE ON ORANGUTANS TO FOCUS ON 
STEMMING THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE APES AND THEIR HABITAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Sacrificed to a worldwide demand for mahogany to fashion into desks and dining 
tables, lost to a need for land to feed a growing population, the rain forests 
of Borneo and Sumatra are dwindling fast. And as the trees fall, so too goes 
the only habitat of the orangutan. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, half a world away from where the species is making its last stand, 
scientists, zoo administrators, conservationists and government officials will 
meet at Cal State Fullerton to assess the accelerating threats facing 
orangutans and forge a strategy to help them survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ultimate problem, like it is for so many species on this planet, is 
habitat destruction," said Birute Galdikas, co-founder of the L.A.-based 
Orangutan Foundation International, who has spent the last 23 years studying 
orangutans in the forests of Borneo. "Without the trees they simply cannot 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Uncertainties abound over just how many orangutans remain in the wild, but 
experts believe that up to half the population has been lost over the last 
decade, and the shaggy red apes could be extinct soon after the turn of the 
century if current deforestation practices continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Named for an Indonesian phrase meaning "man of the forest," orangutans are the 
most solitary of the great apes, ranging widely as they travel through the 
forest canopy. As development of their once-lush island habitat continues, the 
highly intelligent animals -- among the closest living relatives to humans -- 
are forced to survive in smaller and more isolated pockets of protected land. 
</P>
<P>
 Two large islands in the Indonesian archipelago, Borneo and Sumatra, were 
still heavily covered with forests when Galdikas began her independent studies 
in 1971. Since then, an estimated 80% of the orangutan's habitat has been 
cleared through commercial logging and agriculture. The orangutan population is 
estimated today at 20,000 to 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers hope this weekend's conference will go beyond traditional academic 
presentations to plans for protecting the endangered primate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually at these kinds of sessions, you go, you read your paper and you go 
home," said Lori Sheeran, faculty adviser for the conference. "Here, we want 
something concrete." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, academic conferences have had "a minimal impact on conservation 
of species," said Ulysses Seal, a conservation biologist. "This reflects a 
longstanding division between the academic and the conservation communities." 
That division, he said, is slowly dissolving, as the Fullerton conference 
illustrates. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "Orangutans: The Neglected Ape," the three-day meeting was organized by 
Norm Rosen, a graduate student in anthropology at Cal State Fullerton who 
learned in the course of his research two years ago that there had not been a 
major academic conference on the animal since a 1979 meeting in the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been so many years since conservationists and field people and zoo 
people have gotten together to discuss the problems facing orangutans," Rosen 
said. He approached the faculty of the university's anthropology department and 
decided to organize the conference as his master's project. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of individuals and organizations have worked together to bring the 
conference to Fullerton, including the school's Anthropology Student Assn., the 
Zoological Society of San Diego and Zoo Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with a renewed commitment from the Indonesian government, deforestation 
and illegal hunting -- for food and for the pet trade -- continue. Much of the 
logging is selective, but often the trees left standing by loggers are quickly 
felled to make room for agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, too little is known about the eating habits and movements of the 
animals to create an effective management plan, said Mark Leighton, a Harvard 
professor. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a strong need for better surveys of remaining forested areas in 
Borneo and in some cases a redesign of the reserve system," Leighton said. 
Also, he said, "It has to be approached as a comprehensive problem, not just 
orangutans." 
</P>
<P>
 Borneo and Sumatra are home to a number of equally endangered forest species, 
many of them found nowhere else: proboscis monkeys, clouded leopards, Sumatran 
tigers and rhinoceroses. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of Indonesian conservation efforts will depend largely on 
international financial support for park management and basic research, Seal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 60 professionals will make presentations at the conference, and about 
200 more will attend.

INS URGED TO SETTLE BLACKS' BIAS COMPLAINT; DISCRIMINATION: HOUSE COMMITTEE 
CHAIRMEN ADVISE AGENCY CHIEF TO LEARN FROM LESSON OF THE FBI, WHICH DEALT WITH 
SIMILAR CHARGES LAST YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing well-founded charges of discrimination, three powerful congressional 
committee chairmen have urged Immigration and Naturalization Service 
Commissioner Doris Meissner to settle a complaint alleging agencywide bias 
against African American officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The INS should . . . move expeditiously toward recognition of the 
well-founded claims of federal employees for simple justice," the three 
congressmen wrote in a March 1 letter to Meissner. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislators urged Meissner to learn from the experience of the FBI, which 
last year settled similar discrimination claims on behalf of more than 400 
black agents. Among other things, the bureau agreed to promote blacks to 
supervisory slots. 
</P>
<P>
 Urging the INS to settle were House Judiciary Chairman Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), 
John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), head of the Committee on Government Operations, and 
William L. Clay (D-Mo.), chairman of the Committee on Post Office and Civil 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The three committees oversee employment practices at the Justice Department, 
parent body of the INS and FBI. The department's many tasks include enforcement 
of laws banning discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Thomas, who directs congressional and public affairs for the INS, 
declined to comment on the legislators' request to Meissner. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS has not responded directly to the charges of discrimination, but 
agency officials have acknowledged disparities in representation of African 
Americans in management. Blacks account for more than 11% of the INS payroll, 
agency figures show, but they occupy fewer than 6% of the best-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Black INS officers have cited 14 years of alleged discrimination, including 
workplace harassment, imposition of unequal discipline and bias in determining 
promotions. The officers are seeking back pay, promotions, and wide-ranging 
reform of the agency's personnel policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS officers' complaint -- which originated with black criminal 
investigators in the Los Angeles district -- is pending before the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission, an independent federal body that 
investigates bias charges. An administrative law judge last month certified the 
matter as a class action, broadening it to include more than 500 INS employees 
and former workers nationwide.

U.S., STATE TO COLLABORATE ON STUDY OF SAGE SCRUB, WETLANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kicking off the National Biological Survey, the U.S. Department of the 
Interior and the California Resources Agency agreed Friday to collaborate in 
gathering and sharing scientific information about the state's rare wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Two major issues that pit developers against conservationists were chosen as 
the primary focus of the agreement: the California gnatcatcher and other 
species that live in Southern California's sage scrub, and the Sacramento 
Valley wetlands, which are home to a threatened species of snake. The federal 
government agreed to devote $200,000 this fiscal year to each of the two 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Biological Survey, a new division of the Interior Department, was 
created in November by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt with the purpose of 
collecting scientific data on all of the nation's animals and plants. 
</P>
<P>
 With Friday's agreement, state and federal officials will create an electronic 
system in California to disseminate the data to local officials and property 
owners for their use in deciding how to develop land. 
</P>
<P>
 During a visit to San Diego, Babbitt said the California issues are "exactly 
the kind of research" that he wants for the survey. Although California is the 
first state to agree to a partnership with the federal government, similar 
projects are expected across the nation in areas where natural resources are 
deemed endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 "By making sound, objective scientific information available to the public, we 
can . . . work on collaborative planning that meets economic development as 
well as conservation needs," Babbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Wheeler, California's secretary of resources, said the financial and 
scientific help is important. "Private property owners, government officials 
and others will be able to access the same reliable information," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers in the national survey will help the state fill in gaps in its 
research of sage scrub inhabited by the California gnatcatcher, a threatened 
songbird that nests on expensive real estate in Orange, San Diego and Riverside 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The information is needed for an unusual state project that is trying to 
create plans for setting aside preserves of the scrub while allowing the rest 
to be built on without landowners encountering delays. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal researchers will also help the state create a similar plan for 
Sacramento Valley wetlands and uplands inhabited by the giant garter snake, a 
threatened species.

SACRAMENTO FILE: BILL WOULD WIPE 'KNUCKLEHEAD' STATUTES OFF THE STATE'S BOOKS 
</P>

 Outdated state laws going as far back as the 1849 Gold Rush days would be 
repealed under a bill that has been introduced in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing when you realize some of the Jurassic, unproductive, negligible 
and knucklehead laws that still remain on the law books in California," said 
Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria), the author of the measure (AB 
3326). 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell cited statutes pertaining to such subjects as dueling, frog-jumping 
contests rules, "wanted dead or alive" reward posters and the illegal sale of 
quicksilver to "salt" gold mining claims to sell to unsuspecting prospectors. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he expects his list to grow substantially as other legislators 
discover additional laws that no longer are needed and should be wiped from the 
books.

FEBRUARY JOB STATISTICS SHOW GAINS FOR CALIFORNIA AND U.S. AS A WHOLE; ECONOMY: 
THE STATE HAD 9,500 MORE PEOPLE WORKING LAST MONTH, AND ITS UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 
FELL TO 9% FROM 10.1%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a sign that California may be pulling out of its long and punishing 
recession, the federal government reported Friday that the state gained 9,500 
jobs last month and its unemployment rate fell to 9%, down from 10.1% in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's improvement accompanied a strong performance nationally that cut 
the U.S. unemployment rate to 6.5%, from 6.7% the month before, and added 
217,000 jobs to employer payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
 While economists downplayed the significance of the declines in the 
unemployment rates -- particularly the often-volatile state and local figures 
-- they were heartened by the signs of job growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were seeing the job total go down month after month, and now it seems to 
be leveling off," in the state, said Ted Gibson, principal economist for the 
California Department of Finance in Sacramento. "There are grounds for 
encouragement here, especially since February should have had the most negative 
effects from the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 "The preliminary sense is . . . we (in California) may be out of recession and 
that it is happening six months sooner than we had expected back in December," 
said Larry Kimbell, director of the UCLA Business Forecasting Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimbell said he now expects California to enjoy modest gains in employment 
this year, reversing a severe decline since mid-1990 that, by some estimates, 
cost the state more than 800,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The jobless report for Los Angeles County was also encouraging, with 
unemployment dipping to 9.7%, down from 11% a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 December's unemployment rate for Orange County -- the most recent figure 
available -- was 5.3%, down from 5.6% in November. The monthly rates for the 
state's counties normally are issued at the end of following month, but 
January's figures have been delayed until next week because of revisions in the 
method for computing the number of unemployed people and the number of jobs on 
local payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts cautioned that state and local jobless rates swing widely because 
they are drawn from relatively small numbers of household interviews. In 
addition, federal officials said some of the recent fluctuations may stem from 
new information-gathering techniques they adopted this year. Consequently, 
economists focused on the government's separate survey of employer payrolls, 
which showed the gain of 9,500 jobs in California and 217,000 nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's employment increase nationally marked a sharp improvement from 
frigid January, when weather-related problems led to a 2,000-job decline. 
</P>
<P>
 But the increase in jobs in February, which outstripped the pace of employment 
growth for 1993, came even though "the impact of this winter's severe weather 
was still apparent in several industries," Katherine G. Abraham, U.S. 
commissioner of labor statistics, told a hearing of Congress' Joint Economic 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction, retailing and restaurants all were hampered as bad weather kept 
workers and consumers at home, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The general business outlook for the United States appears strong, with the 
Commerce Department reporting Friday that the government's main forecasting 
gauge rose 0.3% in January, the sixth straight monthly increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The gauge, known as the index of leading indicators, includes measures such as 
industrial orders and points to the overall economy's likely performance in the 
next four to six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists said the rebounding national economy may be starting to pull 
California along with it. At the same time, they said, the job losses from 
earthquake-related business closings in February were less than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, analysts said they expect Southern California to enjoy a major 
pickup in construction in coming months as rebuilding efforts get into full 
swing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's already in the bank that this will be a good year for construction," 
Kimbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, job creation has averaged 146,000 a month during the first 13 
months of the Clinton Administration, keeping on schedule with the White 
House's goal of generating 8 million jobs during the President's term. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the production of new jobs remains modest compared with the growth in 
the output of goods and services: The economy expanded at an annual rate of 
7.5% during the final quarter of last year. This was not accompanied by a vast 
expansion of jobs because many companies are benefiting from productivity 
improvements or are choosing to increase overtime hours rather than hire 
additional workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The easiest thing to do is to pay overtime to your current labor force," said 
Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), a member of the Joint Economic 
Committee. "Hiring a new worker means a large fixed overhead with significant 
fringe benefit costs." 
</P>
<P>
 While the average workweek in manufacturing, which had been running at 
near-record levels, dropped last month, the decline was attributed to bad 
weather by Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of the President's Council of 
Economic Advisers.  
</P>
<P>
 Tyson also offered reassuring words for investors worried about erratic bond 
prices and uncertain financial markets. Inflation won't be a menace, she 
insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we look at the fundamentals, we remain absolutely comfortable with the 
forecast we have out there in terms of (economic) growth in the range of 3% 
this year and inflation in the range of 3% this year," she said. "That is our 
forecast, and we remain totally comfortable with it." 
</P>
<P>
 February was the second month in which the government has used its new survey 
for measuring unemployment, including a more accurate count of women in the 
work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the old system, the jobless rate would have been calculated at 6.4% in 
December, 6.3% in January and 6.4% last month. Under the new system, the 
figures were 7% in December, 6.7% rate in January and 6.5% last month.

 Aldyn McKean, 45, an AIDS spokesman who helped start the advocacy group ACT 
UP.Once a singer and actor, McKean appeared in the Broadway show "The Robber 
Bridegroom." He became a leading spokesman for ACT UP when it was formed in

EXPERT CALLS SHAKING IN NORTHRIDGE NO SURPRISE; SEISMOLOGY: SCIENTIST FROM 
PASADENA WARNS HOUSE PANEL THAT OTHER FAULTS APPEAR CAPABLE OF GENERATING FAR 
MORE DESTRUCTIVE QUAKES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The intense shaking that marked the Northridge earthquake really was not that 
surprising or unusual, one of Southern California's most prominent earthquake 
scientists told a congressional committee in Washington this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas H. Heaton, an expert at the U.S. Geological Survey's Pasadena field 
office, also warned that faults under the San Fernando Valley and other parts 
of Los Angeles appear capable of generating quakes that would be far more 
destructive, because they would last up to five times longer and result in 
perhaps eight times larger ground displacement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen some expression of surprise at the intense shaking, or high 
ground acceleration, that was recorded above the (Northridge) earthquake," 
Heaton told the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology on Wednesday. 
A transcript of his testimony was later given to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, I do not find these motions to be surprising," he declared, adding 
that while new or more comprehensive ground acceleration instruments were in 
use in the San Fernando Valley and other parts of Los Angeles for this 
earthquake, precise eyewitness descriptions from past quakes indicate that the 
same kind of shaking has occurred often before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although I believe that indications of such intense shaking have been with us 
for some time, we now have better recordings of the phenomena," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, he added, it is vital for those charged with protecting 
people and structures to understand that while larger magnitude earthquakes 
would not necessarily result in higher instantaneous intensities of shaking, 
they would probably do much more damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, earthquakes larger than our recent Northridge earthquake will have 
considerably larger rupture dimensions which will result in larger regions 
located very close to the earthquake rupture," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Second, the duration of strong shaking will increase significantly. Buildings 
that were damaged in the 10 seconds of strong shaking from Northridge would be 
expected to suffer significantly greater damage in a larger earthquake that may 
last five times longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering the extensive damage caused by the Northridge earthquake, the 
prospect of future earthquakes with larger areas that will experience even 
longer durations of intense shaking is quite disturbing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we hear much about the high ground accelerations from the Northridge 
earthquake, the displacement of the ground was generally less than 30 
centimeters (11.8 inches) above the earthquake, and less than 15 centimeters 
(5.9 inches) in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although we do not expect peak accelerations in a very large earthquake to be 
much greater than we experienced directly above the Northridge earthquake, we 
can anticipate that the ground displacements will be much larger, perhaps in 
excess of 250 centimeters (just over 8 feet)." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he noted, such larger ground motions have already been recorded in a 
remote area of the Mojave desert adjacent to the Landers earthquake of June 28, 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Such movements in an urban area could have "important consequences," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, very tall buildings, base-isolated buildings and large bridges may 
experience significantly larger deformation that we have seen for past 
earthquakes. Second, shorter buildings whose structure elements have been 
damaged by intense high-frequency motion may be susceptible to collapse when 
their foundations are displaced large distances." 
</P>
<P>
 Heaton told the committee that he felt more research is essential because the 
consequences of larger earthquakes beneath urban areas have not been adequately 
considered up to now.

 Carolyn Wyeth, 84, landscape painter and member of the famous Wyeth family of 
artists.A self-described recluse who shunned fame, Miss Wyeth spent much of her 
life in the family house in Chadds Ford, Pa., built by her late father, 
illustrator N.C. Wyeth. She often modeled for portraits by her famous brother, 
Andrew Wyeth, including his "The Critic" in 1990. A sister, Henriette Wyeth 
Hurd, is also a well-known painter, and another sister, Ann Wyeth McCoy, is a 
composer. Miss Wyeth was a respected painter, concentrating on landscapes of 
the rural Chadds Ford area and coastal Maine. Her work was exhibited narrowly, 
primarily at the Brandywine River Museum in Chadds Ford. Her death was 
announced Tuesday in Philadelphia.

JUDGE REFUSES TO BLOCK AHMANSON RANCH; COURTS: RULING SAYS VENTURA COUNTY 
COMPLIED WITH STATE REGULATIONS IN APPROVING ENVIRONMENTAL REPORT ON THE 
PLANNED $1-BILLION DEVELOPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a crushing blow to opponents of the $1-billion Ahmanson Ranch development, 
a Ventura County judge ruled Friday that county officials complied with all 
state environmental laws in approving the mini-city that would be built on the 
border of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 55-page ruling, Superior Court Judge Barbara A. Lane said that the 
Ventura County Board of Supervisors "did not abuse its discretion" in 
certifying the environmental impact report for the development. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys and government officials representing the nine plaintiffs who had 
sought to overturn the board's 1992 approval of the project said they are 
confident that an appeal will be filed with the 2nd District Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our legal arguments have considerable merit," said Mark Weinberger, the 
attorney representing the city of Malibu. "They should have been upheld by the 
trial court and, certainly, review by the Court of Appeal is a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Malibu, Los Angeles County and the cities of Los Angeles and 
Calabasas, as well as several homeowner and environmental groups, joined in the 
lawsuit to block construction of the 3,050-home golf-course community. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit contended that the development's environmental impact report did not 
adequately address the project's effect on their communities. In addition, they 
argued that although traffic and pollution generated by the development would 
be felt most in Los Angeles County, Ventura County would reap most of the tax 
revenue and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were surprised and appalled by the ruling," said Ken Bernstein, an aide to 
Los Angeles Councilwoman Laura Chick, whose district would receive the brunt of 
the traffic from the development. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that there were several significant issues unanswered by the 
(environmental impact report), in particular the potential traffic impacts on 
the western San Fernando Valley," Bernstein said. He said Chick will meet with 
a representative of the Los Angeles city attorney's office Monday to discuss 
filing an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 In her ruling, Lane wrote that in approving the project, the Ventura County 
supervisors decided that the prospect of receiving nearly 10,000 acres of 
public parklands included in the deal, combined with the project's economic and 
recreational benefits, "outweighed the environmental costs." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not the proper role of the courts to substitute our judgment for that 
of the people and their local representatives," Lane concluded in her ruling. 
"The court's 'limited function' is to assure that the public and its 
responsible officials have been fairly informed of the environmental 
consequences of their decisions before they are made. That was accomplished 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County supervisors approved the project in 1992, on the condition that 
Ahmanson Land Co. and its partners acquire and turn over to state and federal 
park agencies 10,000 acres -- most of it owned by entertainer Bob Hope. So far, 
only about 3,000 acres of that land -- including Hope's 2,308-acre Jordan Ranch 
-- has been turned over to park agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson, which has agreed to dedicate 2,633 acres as open space, must also 
deliver two other Hope properties to park agencies before it can go forward 
with its development. These include Hope's 4,369-acre Runkle Ranch near 
Chatsworth and his 339-acre Corral Canyon tract in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Under its agreement with Ventura County, Ahmanson has about two years left to 
acquire Hope's land. The developer, concerned about the potential financial 
effect of the opponents' lawsuit, had put its plans on hold until a legal 
settlement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Trigg, a spokeswoman for Ahmanson, said the developer was pleased with 
the judge's ruling and would wait to see if an appeal would be filed before 
moving ahead with its plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Weston, an attorney representing Ventura County and Ahmanson in the 
case, said: "I hope that they will read the opinion and decide that further 
challenges are a waste of time and energy."

MURDER, RACKETEERING CHARGED IN TRIAL OF 'MILD-MANNERED' LAWYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC HARRISON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He was a "wolf in sheep's clothing," a mild-mannered lawyer and part-time 
judge whose veneer of respectability hid a sordid underworld existence 
involving drugs, money laundering, torture and murder. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how federal prosecutors Friday described Fredric W. Tokars, once an 
up-and-coming member of Atlanta's legal and political community who is now on 
trial on racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the crimes he is accused of committing is the 1992 murder of his wife. 
Sara Tokars was shot down in front of her two young boys by a hit man who said 
that he was hired indirectly by Fredric Tokars. 
</P>
<P>
 She was killed because she had discovered -- at a time when her husband was 
under federal investigation -- evidence of his involvement in tax evasion and 
money laundering, Assistant U.S. Atty. Wilmer Parker told the jury in his 
opening statement.  
</P>
<P>
 Tokars used his expertise in accounting and offshore banking to conceal 
millions of dollars in drug money for violent cocaine traffickers with 
connections in Detroit, Los Angeles and Miami, Parker said. He described Sara 
Tokars, who had wanted a divorce, as "a ticking time bomb" because of what she 
knew about him. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, eight men were indicted on racketeering charges. Four have pleaded 
guilty to drug-related charges and are set to testify against Tokars. A 
separate trial on the murder charge will be held later. 
</P>
<P>
 The racketeering trial for Tokars and another defendant, James Mason, was 
moved to Birmingham because the case has been so heavily covered by the Atlanta 
media. Defense lawyers argued it would be impossible to seat an impartial jury 
in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Selecting a jury was difficult even in Alabama, in part because the case -- 
the subject of book and movie deals -- has been publicized nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 The media feeding frenzy figures into Tokars' defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The case became a "spectacular media show" that the police and Sara Tokars' 
family exploited to ruin Tokars, said Jerome Froelich, one of Tokars' 
attorneys. The family's motive was to get custody of the two children, he said. 
In addition, one of Sara Tokars' sisters was "out to get" Tokars for revealing 
that she had had an abortion and a venereal disease, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the height of the media coverage, one Atlanta television reporter and 
anchorman was fired after it was disclosed that he had entered into a 
partnership with several news sources to sell movie rights. Movie producers 
would pay more money if Tokars were found guilty, so the reporter aired 
negative stories and sought out witnesses who could implicate Tokars in 
wrongdoing, Froelich said. 
</P>
<P>
 The publicity, which Froelich alleged was fed by police department leaks, 
caused other witnesses to have "sudden revelations" and to come forward months 
after the murder so that they too could "become heroes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While prosecutors portrayed Tokars' associations with drug dealers and his 
legal activities in their behalf as sinister, Froelich tried to put an innocent 
face on it: "When you're a criminal defense lawyer, you meet people who have 
problems, you meet people who deal drugs, you meet people who pay in cash." 
</P>
<P>
 He described Tokars as a hard-working, naive, white attorney who was taken in 
by a black "con man of con men" named Eddie Lawrence, with whom Tokars became 
business partners for the purpose of making inroads into the African American 
community. The lawyer suggested that Lawrence had Sara Tokars killed because of 
disagreements he had had with Tokars over their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men were partners in a number of businesses, including a home 
remodeling business and real estate company.  
</P>
<P>
 Waving a giant photograph of the Georgia electric chair, Froelich told the 
jury that Lawrence, a key witness against Tokars, is lying to avoid the death 
penalty. "He doesn't ride the lightning if he can do one thing -- give (the 
authorities) Fred Tokars," Froelich said.

 Audience participation: The Olympic Auditorium, which reopens tonight after a 
long darkness, has been the scene of some memorable boxing matches -- and a few 
memorable riots.

 During one chair-breaking, bottle-throwing rampage by spectators a 
quarter-century ago, sportswriter Merv Harris of the L.A. Herald Examiner 
spotted a man nursing a cut over his eye outside the arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "How did it happen?" Harris asked.

 "I think it was a left hook," responded the man, who had boxed in one of the

 Too much of a stretch for L.A.? We asked readers to suggest alternatives for 
Nicolino, the beleaguered artist who has been meeting resistance from officials

 Louise Alvarez of San Diego says: "How about stretching those bras from San 
Pedro to Catalina Island. . . . I'll even donate a few!"

 Unsuspecting pastors, church executives and volunteers in nonprofit 
organizations can end up in trouble -- even in court -- if they do not 
understand their legal liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena will present a Ministry 
Liability Workshop from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. March 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've given this seminar a number of times before," said Shirley Mewhinney, 
Fuller's acting director of continuing education. "It's back by popular 
demand." 
</P>
<P>
 Conducted by attorney Dennis Kasper, who specializes in legal concerns of 
religious and charitable organizations, the workshop will cover situations that 
place professional and lay people at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 A partner in the Los Angeles firm of Lewis, D'Amato, Brisbois & Brisgaard, 
Kasper said that sexual misconduct and employment disputes -- two growing areas 
of litigation -- can take congregations or charities by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find that people expect that employees, board members and volunteers in 
religious organizations will treat each other fairly and with respect," he 
said. "Especially with regard to sexual misconduct, they think: 'This kind of 
thing could never happen in my church or school.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But it does, he cautioned, and anyone in a position of responsibility in a 
nonprofit or religious organization should be aware of legal pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Because religious organizations often offer counseling, he said, the workshop 
will discuss issues that can ignite legal problems -- incompetence, breaches of 
confidentiality and ignorance of child-abuse reporting laws. Good interviewing 
and screening techniques, proper supervision and stringent record-keeping can 
go a long way toward averting trouble, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He recommends that organizations "have a well-thought-out approach" to 
handling allegations of child abuse and sexual misconduct and train small teams 
to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 They can help assure that proper authorities handle the investigation, that 
facts are made public but rumors do not escalate and that appropriate 
disciplinary measures are taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranking alongside these thorny problems is the mishandling of money, Kasper 
said. Churches sometimes unwittingly fail to keep their records in order and 
their bylaws updated, or to elect the required number of directors to their 
boards, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the workshop will have a Christian perspective, members of any faith 
may register. The fee is $90, which includes a 200-page legal handbook compiled 
by Kasper. A discount is available for group registration. For reservations or 
information, call (800) 235-2222, Ext. 5338. DATES

CITY WATCH; FINISH THE JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After four months of investigation, an independent panel of engineering 
experts has given the Metropolitan Transportation Authority good news and bad 
news about the Red Line subway. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that the 4.4-mile-long subway is structurally safe.Its 
tunnels and five stations even rode out the big Jan. 17 earthquake without 
serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that -- as The Times first reported months ago -- the concrete 
used to line the tunnels is in many places not as thick as called for in 
contracts with the builder, Tutor-Saliba Corp. In a related report, experts 
concluded that the company that oversaw Tutor-Saliba's construction work, 
Parsons-Dillingham, had fallen short of "acceptable industry practice." 
</P>
<P>
 The reports mean that soon the local elected officials who sit on the MTA 
board will have to make a very hard decision. Should MTA allow 
Parsons-Dillingham and Tutor-Saliba to keep working on future segments of the 
subway, as they have been contracted to do? Or should the MTA opt for other 
builders to complete the subway? The process could be politically painful, 
because both firms are local and well-connected. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever decision is made, there is no question about one thing: The 
subway's problems are not the taxpayers' fault, so no public money should pay 
for repairs. Tutor-Saliba and Parsons-Dillingham did not meet their full 
contractual obligations on the Red Line. They must pay for all the repairs 
needed to set things right or be allowed to go back into the tunnels and do the 
job right.

POLITICAL FUND-RAISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Talk about twisting the truth and omitting facts in order to make a 
journalistic point! Daniel Weintraub's article on political fund-raising 
("Groups With Stake in State Top Wilson's Donor List," Feb. 27) states: 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . In many other instances last year, (Gov.) Wilson accepted and kept 
contributions from interests that were seeking to influence him on important 
matters. Some examples: On the eve of introduction Oct. 1 of a controversial 
new form of diesel fuel, Texaco picked up the $30,000 catering bill for a huge 
Wilson fund-raiser at Bob Hope's desert home. Arco contributed $10,000 at the 
same event. Despite protests from truck drivers who said the new fuel would 
cost more and damage their engines, Wilson let the regulation take effect on 
schedule two days later." 
</P>
<P>
 What The Times did not report was the following: 
</P>
<P>
 The "controversial new diesel fuel" was a cleaner-burning, low-sulfur diesel 
fuel mandated in 1988 by the California Air Resources Board to take effect Oct. 
1, 1993. From the start CARB recognized that the new fuel would result in 
higher prices. Only after the cleaner-burning diesel was in the marketplace and 
prices began to rise did truckers raise questions about the fuel's effects on 
truck engines. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Gov. Wilson appointed a Diesel Fuel Advisory Committee. After 
hearings were held (in which Arco, among many others, supported the CARB 
clean-air mandate), the committee recommended that the governor uphold the 
clean diesel regulations. Wilson agreed, saying: "California has no choice but 
to clean up the air emissions of mobile sources, and suspension of the CARB 
rule is inconsistent with that goal." 
</P>
<P>
 This, then, is the background to your allegations -- a background that was 
totally irrelevant to your reporter, who clearly set out to imply that the 
decision to mandate the cleaner-burning diesel had been influenced by 
contributions to a fund-raising event. If that isn't unfair reporting, what is?

WHEN THE TARGET IS AMERICA; WORLD TRADE CENTER CASE: A CREDIT TO THE 
INVESTIGATORS AND PROSECUTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One year and six days after a 1,200-pound bomb killed six people, injured more 
than 1,000 and did $550 million in damage to New York's World Trade Center, a 
federal jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts against the four defendants 
in the case. That verdict, which could result in life sentences, was a credit 
to the painstaking work done by investigators and prosecutors.At the same time 
the verdict is a reminder that this country, because of its proud tradition of 
openness and its international leadership, remains vulnerable to acts of 
violence inspired by politics, ideology or religious fanaticism. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no sure way to immunize the country against imported terrorism. At 
best, life can be made harder for would-be terrorists, to begin with by looking 
closer at visa applications to screen out those with criminal pasts. But no 
security measures are foolproof. Tens of millions of foreign visitors are 
welcomed each year. Meanwhile, our laws, or lack of them, make it easy for 
those bent on terrorism to obtain weapons and the materials for explosives. 
</P>
<P>
 It removes nothing from the efficient police work in the World Trade Center 
case to recall that the conspirators, described by the government as Muslim 
fundamentalists, did some truly stupid things before and after their crime, 
sowing an evidentiary trail that led straight to their convictions. Others 
might not be so accommodatingly self-incriminating. Will other terrorist acts 
be attempted? It would be foolish not to expect so. And it would be foolish in 
the extreme not to do everything possible to tighten security at those sites -- 
government buildings, power plants and the like -- that could be the most 
inviting targets.

NO GAIN FROM TOO MUCH PAIN; HELPING DOCTORS HUMANELY TREAT CANCER PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federally appointed medical panel has now confirmed what cancer patients, 
but apparently not their doctors, long have known: They suffer enormous, 
intractable pain and are often not treated adequately for it. Certainly doctors 
have had cause to err on the side of caution, fearing malpractice suits if 
their patients became addicted to opiates. But too often they have acted out of 
ignorance or relied on outdated medical myths. Some doctors think the pain is 
imagined, others fear turning their patients into street-drug abusers. Other 
doctors apparently hold the view that the very young and the very old tolerate 
pain better than other people. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MYTHS: The panel -- led by a prominent nurse educator and two top 
oncologists -- has now blown away these and other myths about pain. In 
publishing new clinical guidelines for doctors and nurses, it concluded that 
"undertreatment of cancer pain is common because of clinicians' inadequate 
knowledge" and that pain can be controlled by "relatively simple means" in nine 
of every 10 patients. 
</P>
<P>
 A summary of the guidelines is in Thursday's issue of the New England Journal 
of Medicine, along with a new yearlong national study of cancer outpatients 
that concluded that 42% were not given adequate analgesic therapy. The study 
found that physicians working at centers catering to minorities were three 
times as likely as others to underestimate the severity of pain and prescribe 
insufficient doses of painkillers. 
</P>
<P>
 The new guidelines urge a varied, graduated approach to pain management, 
starting with simple remedies like aspirin and acetaminophen, or hypnosis and 
relaxation therapy. But the panel urges doctors, when all else fails, not to 
shrink from an aggressive regimen of morphine and other opiates, and it gives 
specific recommended doses for both children and adults. 
</P>
<P>
 In so doing, the panel dismisses the main fear about such drugs: that they 
cause addiction. Tolerance, or the need for increasing doses of opiates over 
time, the report states, usually means the disease has advanced, not that the 
patient is becoming addicted; those with stable disease can be maintained on a 
steady dose for weeks or months. It says that tolerance often is confused with 
the psychological dependence, or addiction, seen in drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MILLIONS: This is a conclusion of wide interest not only to doctors and 
nurses but many American families. A million new cases of cancer are diagnosed 
annually in the United States, and the disease is the cause of one in five 
deaths. Anyone who has had a loved one die of cancer knows of the agony. It is 
often unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 These guidelines should give support to doctors who have withheld 
pain-relieving medications out of fear of attracting the interest of the Drug 
Enforcement Administration, state medical boards or malpractice lawyers. The 
government is making available free consumer guides on the recommendations in 
English and Spanish, as well as a more detailed, 200-page version for 
clinicians. For a copy, call (800) 422-6237. Doctors please note.

NANCY KERRIGAN'S SILVER MEDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clearly, Nancy Kerrigan won the gold, which in no way deprecates Oksana 
Baiul's performance. Were we all watching the Olympics or politics? The five 
judges who voted for Baiul were all from former Iron Curtain countries. The 
three Western judges and the Japanese judge were simply outnumbered.

 The Olympics should return to its origins -- athletes representing themselves

order in which the medals were awarded after the free program section of the 
competition, worth two-thirds the total of all the score.  
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan failed to complete a required element early in her routine and did 
all else first-rate. Baiul happened to have a subtle but nevertheless 
two-footed landing of one of the mandatory elements and delivered a routine 
beyond all artistic expectations for a 16-year-old or just about any age range. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is perhaps fair to rank equally well the technical portion of their 
programs, it is equally clear that Baiul's level of artistry and variety far 
outclassed Kerrigan's. No offense intended.  
</P>
<P>
 By the by, I am as patriotic as the next fellow, and love and admire America 
just as much. But one simply should not allow one's sense of value or judgment 
to be colored by an overdose of this sentiment, a very worthy and noble one 
indeed.

outstanding Winter Olympics was not when a talented athlete took a fall or lost 
a medal by one-tenth of a point. No, it was the day of the closing ceremonies 
when I saw that Kerrigan would not be joining her teammates. Instead, she was 
at Disney World given accolades reserved for American heroes (March 1-2).  
</P>
<P>
 Funny, I always thought being a part of an American team for better or worse 
and as an example for the youth of our country made one a hero.

 Well, Nancy never said she was skating for her team, but for her personal

CORONER'S OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is in response to the letter from Robert D. Tyre (Feb. 17), who expressed 
frustration over the handling of his niece Amy Tyre-Vigil by the Los Angeles 
County coroner's office in the aftermath of the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Tyre-Vigil died as a direct result of the earthquake. She was reportedly 
pronounced dead at 5 a.m. From the time she was pronounced dead until 
approximately 1 p.m., her death went unreported to the coroner. By the time her 
death was finally reported, she had been driven around in the back of a police 
car in an attempt to get a hospital morgue to accept her body, when by law she 
was the responsibility of the coroner. Had Amy's body been left at the scene 
and immediately reported to the coroner (as the law also requires), she could 
have been handled and released by the following day, Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy's body was released for services within 48 hours of coroner notification 
(considered the appropriate standard for body disposition based on recent 
management audits). Similarly, all of the disaster victims were handled in an 
expeditious and compassionate manner, despite the recent layoffs suffered by 
this office. Furthermore, the coroner did not lose property as alleged by Tyre. 
Amy's clothing has been delivered to the family. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, rescue efforts by fire, law enforcement and other agencies were the best 
anyone has seen. But in many cases the coroner was by their side in the field 
directly involved in the extrication of victims. No, recovering decedents from 
these tragic scenes does not win the coroner praise and admiration. But there 
are 145 hard-working, dedicated employees in this office who are keenly aware 
of the dramatically important role they play in providing compassionate and 
efficient service to the citizens of Los Angeles County. It is for these 
employees that we cannot permit allegations which generally paint each of them 
as "discourteous, insensitive and poorly trained" to remain uncontested. We 
don't pretend to have an agency incapable of making mistakes, particularly 
during the stress of a disaster which stretches the human psyche to its outer 
limits. But we do not condone rudeness and we try to deal with it effectively, 
keeping in mind that mistakes by a few do not represent the performance of the 
entire organization.

 * Re "Marketing the Morgue," Feb. 22: 
</P>
<P>
 Morgue humor is inappropriate. It is yet another way to glamorize crime and 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Ed Edelman is right when he says the souvenirs are probably not 
such innocent fun for the families and friends of loved ones who have suffered 
violent or accidental deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Lewis (coroner's office marketing coordinator) thinks we are awfully 
stuffy, and death is awfully scary, and something like this helps us tolerate 
things a little easier. You've got to be kidding. Maybe you'd like to go one 
step further and personalize the items. For example, get the family of the 
victim to provide a signature, or a photo and add that to the design? 
</P>
<P>
 This marketing idea is in the very worst of taste, and I find it hard to 
believe the Board of Supervisors would even have considered doing business this 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 When Marilyn Lewis has lost a family member or friend through violence or 
dreadful accident, let her market that image first.

ARTIST F.M. ARNOLD DIES AT 93; HELPED LAUNCH 'A NIGHT IN FULLERTON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU PICKEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Florence Millner Arnold, a longtime Fullerton resident and artist known for 
her dedication in promoting art appreciation, has died of natural causes. She 
was 93. 
</P>
<P>
 Known affectionately to friends and students as Flossie, she helped launch the 
arts celebration "A Night in Fullerton" nearly 30 years ago. The annual event 
now draws more than 20,000 people to a night of performance and visual arts at 
local museums on the last Friday in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "Push your peripheries and do the unthinkable," Mrs. Arnold always told those 
around her, said close friend Dede Ginter. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 42-year career as a music teacher in north Orange County schools, Mrs. 
Arnold embraced painting at the age of 50 and went on to become an 
internationally recognized artist in the "hard-edge" abstract school. Examples 
of her work and writings are archived in the Smithsonian Institution, Fullerton 
spokeswoman Sylvia Palmer said.  
</P>
<P>
 In honor of her 90th birthday, friends created an art scholarship for aspiring 
young artists in her name. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flossie was a generous woman, and she gave to the community with her ideas 
and projects, with her talent, her time and her money," said Gloria Schlaepfer, 
a friend who recorded Mrs. Arnold's oral history. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Arnold died Wednesday at Parkvista at Morningside convalescent home in 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 She is survived by her daughter, Adrienne Chakerian of Reedley, Calif., two 
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.  
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. Tuesday at St. Paul's Lutheran 
Church, 111 W. Las Palmas Drive, Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The family requests that donations in Mrs. Arnold's memory be made to the 
American Heart Assn. or a favorite charity. MARY LOU PICKEL

ENCINO PARK GROUP HELPED AFTER QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Encino Park Improvement Committee appreciates your reporting (Feb. 10) on 
how neighbors on two blocks in Encino Park helped one another after the Jan. 17 
earthquake and why our homes survived so well. 
</P>
<P>
 EPIC has been active in reducing crime since its founding in 1980, and 
introduced tract-wide Neighborhood Watch in 1990.We relinquished it and our 
emergency response network in 1992 to others who wanted to administer them 
tract-wide. Nonetheless, we got many calls after the earthquake from residents 
requesting help, and we provided it. 
</P>
<P>
 Other major EPIC efforts include working to save our tract from exploitation 
by apartment developers since our shopping center was torn out in 1980, 
distributing questionnaires for tract-wide votes on community issues such as 
rapid transit, holding a time-consuming and costly beautification awards 
program in 1992 and having a get-out-the-vote campaign in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times has reported most of this. Thank you. Your help has been invaluable 
and shows the importance of a newspaper that supports the community as your 
Valley Edition does.

FREEWAY MONORAIL WOULD RISK LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was shocked to see the letter from County Supervisor Mike Antonovich (Feb. 
27), in which he is still promoting the idea of a monorail on the Ventura 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps he missed the earthquake we had on Jan. 17. I couldn't imagine the 
tragedy which would occur if an earthquake struck during a rush hour if a 
monorail were in place. Can you imagine several trains traveling at 60 or 70 
m.p.h. with hundreds of passengers on board being derailed and flying into 
hundreds of cars? 
</P>
<P>
 Let's not trade lives for dollars.

LIVES OF PETS, KIDS OUTWEIGH COYOTES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frankly, I don't know whether to laugh or cry at the bumbling by our city 
officials with regard to the coyote trapping ban. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is this: The coyote population is growing too rapidly and they 
are killing our pets by the hundreds and stalking our kids like never before. 
</P>
<P>
 The animal-rights fanatics who whine incessantly about overdevelopment should 
have done so in 1964, not 1994. Perhaps they prefer to live with their heads in 
the sand, but for the thousands of us who are parents and pet owners, not on 
your life. Or theirs!

VOTE OF SUPPORT FOR VALLEY COLLEGE'S LEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 earthquake, all types of media have issued, printed, and 
talked to or about psychologists who have stressed the urgent need for affected 
Angelenos to return to normalcy. Cal State Northridge, the Los Angeles Unified 
School District, businesses, Caltrans, Metrolink and others have been praised 
for their efforts to speed our recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' Feb. 11 article about a vote of no confidence for Los Angeles 
Valley College President Mary E. Lee by a majority of faculty led by Jack 
Sterk, speech instructor, seems to go against this current trend. To the best 
of my knowledge, the campus suffered small amounts of damage. Even the 
bookstore staff worked to get stock in order for an early opening. 
</P>
<P>
 While it may be a fact that many faculty and students suffered damage, a later 
return would probably not have solved these problems. Many of the quake-created 
damages will take months to repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Why does Sterk, a person in a leadership role, demean efforts to return his 
workplace to normal operations? How thankful those of us in the surrounding 
community are that Valley College was able to open so soon with minimal loss. 
The ability to continue helping students and community with its learning 
process is to be complimented and admired.

LAWMAKER PRAISES QUAKE BILL SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I applaud your editorial support for Rep. Howard L. Berman's proposal to allow 
individuals to deduct all uninsured earthquake losses suffered in the 
Northridge earthquake from their federal income tax returns ("Middle Class 
Needs Help Too," Feb. 22). 
</P>
<P>
 I want to bring to your attention the fact that I've authored the state Senate 
bill 561, which will provide relief identical to the Berman bill for 
individuals filing state income tax returns.SB 561 also allows a carry-over to 
future years of 100% of excess losses. Current law allows for only a 50% 
carry-over.  
</P>
<P>
 We must view the recent crisis as a beginning, not an end. We can help 
jump-start the economy by making sure that taxpayers in the San Fernando Valley 
and other areas damaged by the quake have some financial incentive to rebuild 
and stay here.

BURBANK AIRPORT PROVED INVALUABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I hope the Los Angeles Times and our fellow survivors in the 6.8 quake in 
the San Fernando Valley will join me in thanking Burbank Airport for being 
there, and for making possible the President's visit to the Valley.It was there 
when we needed help. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank Airport's value to the Valley in emergency situations is 
unquestioned. The airport was "shaken" but it kept on "bakin'," to the benefit 
of us all. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you Burbank Airport, for being a friend indeed.

BACKING AHMANSON CITY INAPPROPRIATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * There are three major flaws in the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy's 
advocacy of Ahmanson Ranch City. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy director states that 20 years from now no one will care if 
there are another 500 extra trips on our streets and freeway but that people 
will care if we lose this opportunity to gain parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Ahmanson City will generate 46,000 daily car trips, not 500. Second, as 
attorneys for Ahmanson have stated, there is no deal between Ahmanson and the 
owner of the potential parkland to trade development for parkland. Third, it is 
inappropriate to have the conservancy advocating a city in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Some attempt should be made to acquire the land for a park without insisting 
on development. Each year $900 million of oil-company (pollution) mitigation 
money is available for the purchase of parklands nationwide. Officials should 
be protecting this critical airshed, not encouraging the massive degradation of 
our air quality and transportation systems.

PHOTO OF GRIEVING FAMILY UNNECESSARY

 Printing a picture of Christy Lynne Hamilton's family in an intense moment of 
grief is something I would have expected in a cheap tabloid at the supermarket 
checkout stand. I certainly didn't expect it from the Los Angeles Times. Is 
there no sense of decency, privacy and respect for the suffering of the 
bereaved in your editorial offices?

THANKS OFFERED FOR NEWSPAPER DELIVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you, Los Angeles Times and, in particular, our Times carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 On that awful Monday morning of Jan. 17, frightened beyond any fright we have 
ever felt, afraid to go back into our house and with dirty water, mud and rocks 
two feet deep rushing down our street, we were sitting in our car trying to 
decide what to do -- and who came riding by but our Times carrier? What a 
welcome, normal sight. 
</P>
<P>
 We later found out that a water tank, holding 500,000 gallons, had ruptured, 
causing the flood. For a week we had no electricity, water, only intermittent 
phone service, and of all impossible things, no mail service. Yet every morning 
by 5:30, there was our paper, our link with the outside world.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; WEEKLONG LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today marks the end of Abstinence Week in Costa Mesa, a period in which the 
City Council should have learned a valuable lesson: Read proclamations before 
issuing them. 
</P>
<P>
 An organizer of the drive to obtain the proclamation said the intention was to 
get people to ponder the benefits of delaying sexual activity until marriage 
and to support those who want to abstain.There may be merit in the sentiment, 
but, practically speaking, not all will subscribe to that philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 The real problem was that the organizers' agenda appeared to be more 
complicated. A statement they issued branded "a lie" the red ribbon worn by 
anti-AIDS activists, who say the ribbon symbolizes the fight against the 
disease and memorializes those who have died because of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Abstinence Week organizers said the ribbon "promotes a lifestyle and education 
that allows sex with a condom." The statement, with a white ribbon attached, 
was distributed at a council meeting last month and was deservedly criticized 
by groups fighting AIDS. County health officials chimed in, saying it is not 
enough to promote abstinence. Since many teen-agers are sexually active, other 
safety measures such as condom use are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 When the controversy erupted, Mayor Sandra L. Genis said she had "just kind of 
glanced at" the statement and asserted that it was not part of the official 
declaration. But to avoid misunderstandings in the future, the council should 
be more careful in studying and endorsing seemingly routine proclamations.

MANY FANS DON'T THINK KERRIGAN'S PERFORMANCE WAS MMM, MMM GOLD

 Mike Downey,

 Got some news for you, buddy. Nancy wasn't the best, didn't deserve the gold, 
and she sure as shooting ain't a good sport. Her program, though technically 
quite proficient, was bland, lacked depth, and, as the referee said later, 
didn't come from the heart like that of Oksana Baiul.

 Once again, Americans like Mike Downey have proved what poor sports they are

Nancy Kerrigan skated about as well as she could but lost by the slimmest of 
margins.

 America should be featuring winners, but Campbell's soup, Reebok and Disney 
play up a loser. Bonnie Blair should be going to Disneyland and be featured as 
a winner by American corporations. This country needs winners and losers as 
role models for our youth. Bonnie Blair has worked to reach the top, and our 
corporations need to show our winners.

 How come Tonya Harding got a second chance to skate because her shoelace 
broke? The downhill skier did not get a second chance when his ski came off at 
the start. Quincy Watts did not get a second chance when his shoe split in the 
middle of the 400 meters. Equipment problems are part of sport.  
</P>
<P>
 I have had enough of Tonya's bully tactics. She might have been able to scare 
the USOC or the Olympic judges, but do you think she will be able to intimidate 
the guards at the Oregon State Prison?

 "Poll Finds 20% Know World Cup in U.S." trumpeted the headline in the Feb. 28 
Newswire. The story reported that a Harris Poll found that "53% of Americans 
said they aren't interested in watching a World Cup game on television, and 62% 
said they have no interest in attending one of the games." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time a World Cup will be played in the U.S. Shouldn't the 
story have pointed out instead that 47% (more than 125 million viewers) wanted 
to watch a World Cup game on TV? That 38% said they are interested in attending 
one of the games -- despite the fact that all 3.6 million tickets are virtually 
sold out? Is it any wonder that soccer fans suspect an anti-soccer bias in the 
U.S. media?

OUT OF INNER MONGOLIA; EXHIBITION COVERS 3,500 YEARS OF HISTORY -- AND MAKES 
SOME OF ITS OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Genghis Khan has few peers in the annals of world history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mongol conqueror, who lived from around 1167 to 1227, united nomadic 
tribes into a terrifyingly effective army and founded the largest land empire 
in history, stretching from Eastern Europe to the Sea of Japan. His cultural 
achievements are less celebrated than his military and political genius, but 
the law and order he imposed on the Asian steppe fostered East-West exchanges 
along the system of trade routes known as the Silk Road. 
</P>
<P>
 With all those credits, few would dispute Genghis Khan's right to change his 
name from Temujin, or iron worker, to the Chinese equivalent of "universal 
ruler." Fewer still would question the marketing wisdom of attaching his 
moniker to a landmark exhibition, "Genghis Khan: Treasures From Inner 
Mongolia," which opens Sunday at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles 
County. The show actually covers 3,500 years of history -- most of them before 
Genghis' reign -- but the American appetite for celebrities, violence and 
precious objects makes the title irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing is routine about the display of artworks from China's legendary 
hinterlands, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first major exhibition of cultural relics from one of China's 
autonomous regions, and it comes at a timely moment," said Adam T. Kessler, a 
Los Angeles-based archeologist who organized the show. "Of all the areas in the 
People's Republic of China where archeological survey and excavation have been 
carried out, Inner Mongolia is one place that has made remarkable strides. 
</P>
<P>
 "For one thing, its (dry) climate has helped to preserve an astonishing array 
of ancient settlements, cities, burial sites and artifacts," he said. "The work 
of Inner Mongolian archeologists who have been laboring for decades in the 
field has resulted in finds that are nothing short of extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the artworks in "Genghis Khan" have been previously exhibited in the 
West. Indeed, some of them have been unearthed during the past few years and 
are only known to a small circle of specialists. Among the treasures are a 
spectacular headdress from the Warring States Period (475-221 BC) with a 
turquoise eagle atop a spiral of gold bas-relief, and a gilded bronze funerary 
mask from the Liao Dynasty (907-1125). 
</P>
<P>
 Reciting a litany of the show's unusual features, Kessler noted that it 
doesn't conform to regulations governing China's national treasures. An 
18-month tour -- proceeding from Los Angeles to the Morris Museum in 
Morristown, N.J., the American Museum of Natural History in New York, the 
Tennessee State Museum in Nashville and the Royal British Columbia Museum in 
Victoria -- exceeds the customary 12-month limit for loans of artworks. A 
maximum of 100 objects is generally permitted to leave the country in a 
traveling exhibition, and no more than 15% of them can be plucked from rosters 
of "first category," or first-class, objects. But "Genghis Khan" contains more 
than 150 pieces and more than half of them are from the top echelon. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition is the first concrete example of the liberalization of Chinese 
policies regarding national treasures, Kessler said, and he hopes it will set a 
precedent. But impressive as these facts may be, he believes the show's primary 
value is educational. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most Westerners know of Genghis Khan and the Mongols," he said. "On the other 
hand -- although we commonly acknowledge such maxims as 'Rome was not built in 
a day' -- we tend to assume the spontaneous generation of a historical 
phenomenon such as the Mongols and to shroud their cultural heritage in a 
mysterious and impenetrably dark past." But Inner Mongolian archeologists 
emphasize the value of viewing the Mongol conquests as the culmination of a 
continuous historical process, rather than an isolated phenomenon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have designed this exhibition so that Western audiences can appreciate the 
fact that the Mongols were but the last in a long series of steppe empires to 
emerge from East Asia and were truly the inheritors of a rich and diverse 
past," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The artworks tell a story beginning with the Stone Age and proceeding through 
the evolution of various empires. Text panels, maps, photographs and facsimiles 
-- including a partial re-creation of a Mongol-era tomb -- enhance the 
exhibition's educational and expository value. 
</P>
<P>
 So-called treasures shows -- which foster appreciation for the cultural 
heritage of faraway places -- are said to be a thing of the past because they 
have become too expensive or politically explosive to be worth the effort. But 
the flow of objects from Inner Mongolia is probably only beginning, Kessler 
said, because the region is a great archeological frontier and Inner Mongolians 
are eager to spread the word of their achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't exactly roll out the red carpet and empty their coffers upon 
request, however. Organizing the exhibition was a four-year effort that 
required harrowing journeys to remote sites and protracted negotiations with 
officials at small prefectural museums; Ulan Bator, the capital of Inner 
Mongolia, and the Bureau of Culture in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his fluency in Chinese and scholarly contacts, Kessler often doubted 
that he could bring off the exhibition. "Like any Westerner, I was unprepared 
for the obstacles I had to hurdle," he said. The fundamental problem is 
philosophical, he said, noting that Americans tend to see things in black and 
white, and to demand quick answers, while the Chinese view everything in terms 
of tradition and the needs of their developing country. "We don't have the 
patience or the tenacity to see things through," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing things through Mongolian-style meant pushing trucks over hills during 
flash floods, hitching rides when his vehicles broke down, smoking hundreds of 
cigarettes with government officials and persuading them to loan precious 
artifacts. The result is an array of gold and silver objects, bronze vessels 
and weapons, silk garments, paper documents, ceramics and funerary ware, 
spanning the second millennium BC to the 14th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not intended to be an art show," Kessler said. "I think that what's 
important to bring out from China now is what archeology can tell us about 
ancient records and historical events. But that doesn't mitigate the beauty of 
the pieces. They are works of art; they are masterpieces."

MUSIC REVIEW; FOUR VIEWS FROM GUITAR SUMMIT; A MASTER SAMPLER REFLECTS STYLES 
FROM TWO CULTURES THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED GREATLY TO THE INSTRUMENT'S EVOLUTION. 
THE MUSICIANS WILL PLAY SUNDAY AT THE IRVINE BARCLAY THEATRE.

 It was a diverse audience that filled the Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena on 
Wednesday for the first Southland stop of the definitively diverse Guitar 
Summit program. The message was clearly one of pluralism, bringing to one stage 
the disparate talents of guitar greats Joe Pass (jazz), Paco Pena (flamenco), 
Pepe Romero (classical) and Leo Kottke (Kottke-esque folk). 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, this was a Spanish-U.S. accord, reflecting styles from two cultures 
that have contributed greatly to the instrument's evolution. By nature a 
sampler, this program was no occasion for obscurity or chance-taking, but the 
overall musical substance of the three-hour concert had a powerful impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Kicking things off with the supple single line melody to "I Remember You," the 
self-effacing Pass wove his particular magic in the difficult realm of solo 
jazz guitar. Better than anyone on the scene, the self-reliant Pass mixes 
chordal and linear inventions and shifts between floating rhythm and an 
internal, propulsive sense of swing. 
</P>
<P>
 From another improvisation-friendly musical style, Pena has mastered the 
flamenco vocabulary of scalar flurries, whisking arpeggios and percussive 
effects. Most important, he invests both precision and passion into his 
playing. In four characteristic pieces, Pena illustrated flamenco's bridge 
between serious and folk traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 True to the conservative nature of the program, Romero stuck to the stock 
stuff of "Romanza" and music by Tarrega, closing with "Fantasia," by his 
guitarist father, Celedonio. Behind a guitar, he exudes confidence and Spanish 
bravura and boasts a mastery of tonal range. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways the most individualistic player of the evening, Kottke showed his 
uncanny ability to make folk music sound like capital-A Art. His flowing brand 
of instrumental music, with his mumbling thumb and nimbly drawn swatches of 
melody -- both earthy and ethereal -- matches his trademarked droll, 
between-song patter. In short, he's a virtuosic digressionist. 
</P>
<P>
 When the guitarists convened onstage at the end for a few tentative duets and 
one quartet piece, it didn't matter that they didn't exactly click together. 
This was a peace-keeping mission, setting aside differences and celebrating a 
few good masters. 
</P>
<P>
 The program moves to UCLA tonight and to the Irvine Barclay Theatre on Sunday.

A THANK-YOU TO REVIEWERS FOR MUSICAL VOYAGES

 John Roos' pop music review of Irish harpist Kim Robertson's concert at Shade 
Tree ("World Tour -- With String Attached," March 2) is a critique that's done 
just right. Though I missed the concert (and too many others because travel is 
difficult), I did not miss it altogether: Roos' description was like an "out of 
body experience" (see Jim Washburn's story about "journeys into consciousness" 
in that same day's View section).While reading Roos' review, I could almost 
feel that I was there at the concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Previews, too, are much appreciated by this music lover in North County. Some 
have pushed me into going to concerts that have changed my life. One was 
Washburn's preview in January, 1993, of a Richard Thompson concert. "GO SEE 
HIM!," Washburn admonished. Another was Mike Boehm's interview in 1992 with 
Rosalie Sorrels. I might have skipped that concert, but the interview was too 
compelling. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks, Calendar section, for my chance to "journey into concert(ness)."

MUSIC REVIEW; PREGNANCY PAUSE AT L.A. PHILHARMONIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Nature the unpredictable intervened Thursday in another Los Angeles 
Philharmonic concert, only this time in a very favorable way. In fact, this 
type of thing used to be called a blessed event. 
</P>
<P>
 Prompted by a different kind of cue, music director Esa-Pekka Salonen had to 
rush his pregnant wife, Jane, to a hospital less than two hours before he was 
scheduled to start Beethoven's almost-appropriately named "Namensfeier" 
(Name-Day) Overture. She gave birth to their second daughter just a few minutes 
before the concert began -- under the baton of another conductor. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant Gershon, a 33-year-old assistant conductor/principal pianist with Los 
Angeles Music Center Opera, took over to lead the full orchestra in a complete 
program for the first time, according to remarks managing director Ernest 
Fleischmann made from the stage of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Gershon acquitted himself well under the trying circumstances. He was 
knowledgeable, calm, prepared, steady -- and cautious. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no way he was likely to make radical changes in what the orchestra 
already had prepared. Still, he did not lack ideas, even if this was not an 
ideal opportunity to make his own views on the works known. 
</P>
<P>
 He led the "Namensfeier" Overture with clarity, lightness and drive. He made 
Steven Stucky's transcription-plus of Purcell's "Music for the Funeral of Queen 
Mary" transparent and dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 He accompanied Catherine Ro, the 18-year-old soloist in Saint-Saens' Violin 
Concerto No. 3, with sensitivity and consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point of her young career, Ro proved more lyric than fiery, producing 
a rather small-sized sound that could have been easily overwhelmed by the 
orchestra. Yet she negotiated the virtuosic demands securely enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Gershon also led Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 in the 
distressingly fleet, characterless modern manner, honoring most if not all the 
repeats (it's hard to keep track in the scherzo without a score) but without 
giving any reason to engage with the music. 
</P>
<P>
 Absent a few glitches, the orchestra played well and seemed strongly 
supportive of the young conductor. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert was part of the "Night Out at the Music Center" outreach series 
aimed at young adults (with specially priced tickets). It drew more than 2,600 
people, most of whom looked to be exactly the right target audience.

 When Sam Moore was a boy in Miami in the 1950s, he had to sneak around the 
house in order to listen to the Grand Ole Opry on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real Christian family," he says. "But I'd get under the covers and 
turn the radio on and listen to Hank Williams and Hank Snow and Tex Ritter. I 
loved all that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Two decades later, a young Travis Tritt found himself having to go through 
similar subterfuge to listen to R&B records in his home in Marrietta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother was a devout Christian and it was music I think she didn't 
understand," he recalls. "I remember the first time I bought a Joe Tex record 
and got it home and played it on a real low volume, but I ended up getting 
caught anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 A black urban kid into country music? A white rural boy into soul? 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was it natural to them, but as they ultimately became music stars 
themselves -- Moore as half of the great '60s soul duo Sam and Dave, Tritt as a 
current country leader -- they took a lot of their cultural border crossing 
influences with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of similarities in both types of music," says Tritt. "They 
speak for the average everyday individual. It's been said in the past -- and I 
tend to agree -- that country music has sort of been white man's blues all 
along anyways." 
</P>
<P>
 That, to a large extent, is the point of "Rhythm Country & Blues," the latest 
installment of PBS' "In the Spotlight" music documentary series, which airs at 
9 p.m. Monday on KCET-TV Channel 28 (and at 8:30 p.m. Tuesday on KVCR-TV 
Channel 24, and at 10 p.m. March 13 on KOCE-TV Channel 50). The show is built 
around the making of the new album of the same name, a unique project in which 
country and R&B stars spanning several generations were paired in genre-busting 
duets on classic songs.  
</P>
<P>
 The excitement of this sharing is easy to see in the faces of the performers, 
caught in studio as they worked with their designated partners: soul veteran Al 
Green teaching Lyle Lovett a few tricks as they worked up Willie Nelson's 
"Ain't It Funny How Time Slips Away," Vince Gill meshing perfectly with Gladys 
Knight on "Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing," a giddy Tritt pushed higher and 
higher as he keeps up with Patti LaBelle's vocal acrobatics on "When Something 
Is Wrong With My Baby," Moore smiling and bouncing as he sings with Conway 
Twitty (his last recording before his death) on "Rainy Night in Georgia." 
</P>
<P>
 The sessions also featured pairings of George Jones and B.B. King, Natalie 
Cole and Reba McEntire, Aaron Neville and Trisha Yearwood, Little Richard and 
Tanya Tucker, Chet Atkins and Allen Toussaint and the Staples with Marty 
Stuart. 
</P>
<P>
 But the show is more than just a look at the making of the album. It's about 
the whole history and development of two parallel kinds of music. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's basically the tale of two cities, Nashville and Memphis, two cities not 
many miles apart, but they may as well be much farther," says David Horn, the 
executive producer of the "In the Spotlight" series for New York public station 
WNET. "They both became major recording meccas for two distinct styles of music 
-- Memphis for rhythm & blues, Nashville for country." 
</P>
<P>
 Elvis Presley became the king of rock 'n' roll by melding the two styles, and 
Ray Charles' ventures into country music remain landmarks. Their efforts opened 
the door for the likes of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, who led the next 
generation of rock stars by borrowing equally from soul and country. The show 
traces the common elements in the genres back to their beginnings -- their 
roots in poor, rural, Southern immigrant cultures -- and how they overcame 
segregation and bigotry to come together at several key junctures.  
</P>
<P>
 "Gospel and religion are certainly an influence in both," Horn says. "What is 
revealed here is how much one group listened to the other group, how much one 
learned from the other." 
</P>
<P>
 Even George Jones, who grew up "so far back in the sticks of East Texas" that 
he was in his teens before he ever saw a black person, sees country and R&B as 
essentially the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "The story of their songs are a lot like country music," he says. "We all had 
the Depression and hard times and the things in our environments, and it was 
just a way of expressing our feelings, and country music did it just a little 
different than they did. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sing a lot with heart and feeling and soul like they do with rhythm & 
blues, and that's the reason they're so together."

INVESTING IN DAVE KOZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In regard to Don Heckman's review, "Dave Koz Takes the Easy Commercial Path at 
Strand" (Feb. 22): I attended Koz's performance and walked away thoroughly 
impressed by an instrumental performer who had enough regard for his audience 
to entertain them with his charmingly infectious personality, as well as what I 
(according to Heckman) wrongly perceived as an abundance of musicianship. 
</P>
<P>
 My problem with most instrumental performers is that they seem to be so 
cerebrally intent on playing every note ever created that I find myself lost 
and thinking about anything but the music.This was not the case with Koz. His 
songs were memorable and the solos succinct. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the headline, I'm sure that there is a myriad of sax players 
struggling desperately to get on that commercial path. I, for one, felt that 
the show was a thoroughly enjoyable investment of my time and money.

THE IMPACT OF MORPHIN POWER ON KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was with grave concern that we recently read of the popularity of "The 
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" and the naive, misleading views from TV 
executives that masqueraded as justifications for the program ("Morphin Mania: 
How -- and Why?," Feb. 26). The executives claimed that each show features a 
"positive" message, contains violence that is acceptable because it is clearly 
marked as fantasy, and offers children "positive role models." A recent study 
we conducted on the "Power Rangers" is alarming in its demonstration that the 
show increases violent behavior in children. 
</P>
<P>
 In our study, one group of children viewed an entire episode of "Power 
Rangers" and then were observed for several minutes playing with classmates. We 
also observed a control group of children who did not watch the episode. There 
was a frightening difference between the aggression levels of the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Children -- especially boys -- who saw the program, displayed six times the 
number of aggressive acts as children in the control group. Much of their 
aggression was a direct imitation of the program's action, such as flying 
karate kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents may be interested in knowing that when we tallied the number of 
aggressive acts in the "Power Rangers" episode that we showed the children, 
there were about 140 aggressive acts in the 23-minute episode. 
</P>
<P>
 Does the show offer positive messages or role models for children? Is the 
surfeit of violence understood by children as mere fantasy, not appropriate for 
the playground? We offer a resounding "no" on all counts. The writers and 
producers have a long way to go before they can claim in good conscience that 
the show has these positive benefits for children.

 Why is the success of "The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" such a mystery to 
anyone -- especially child psychologists, who spend years studying to 
understand children? Any parent knows that kids crave this sort of stuff -- 
good guys whomping bad guys. The theme is very clear and reassuring. If only 
life were so! Sometimes bad just has to be whomped. 
</P>
<P>
 I think the "Power Rangers" is the most innocent, juvenile-appropriate program 
on TV today. What I resent is that mainstream cartoons have become 
adult-themed, as if the writers cannot land jobs with prime-time sitcoms, so 
they've brought their brand of (non)humor to children's cartoons. They are 
peopled with disrespectful and rude characters, idiot adults and filled with 
innocuous sexual innuendo and sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
 These cartoons are too talky, too mean-spirited and confusing. Keep it simple, 
let kids be kids, and you see the results with a successful show such as "The 
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers."

IT'S OK TO BE STRAIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with outrage the letters from indignant readers who condemned "Ace 
Ventura: Pet Detective" as "homophobic" because the title character, after 
discovering he's kissed another man by mistake, runs to the shower to cleanse 
himself ("Hey, Ace, Homophobia's Not So Funny!," Feb. 26). This is not 
homophobic. 
</P>
<P>
 How dare the gay community expect straight people to enjoy kissing members of 
the same sex! No heterosexual could be expected to receive pleasure from 
kissing a person of the same sex -- no more than you'd expect a gay person to 
enjoy kissing the opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
 I am constantly infuriated at the gay community's insistence that everyone is 
gay. It seems to me that the gay community, in their refusal to believe anyone 
could be straight, is exposing itself as "heterophobic." 
</P>
<P>
 One more thing: How come nobody pitched a fit when the exact same scene was 
played out during "The Crying Game," when a character discovered that the woman 
he'd been dating was really a man and ran straight to the bathroom to vomit?

HOMOPHOBIA'S NOT FUNNY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "More Giggles Than Groans in 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' " (Feb. 4), Chris 
Willman asks who could resist Jim Carrey as Ace Ventura. I know I sure can. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't laugh at characters that behave as though homosexuality is revolting 
and subhuman. There are at least four such "jokes," including one montage where 
Ventura discovers that he has kissed another guy and runs into a shower to 
cleanse himself. Ha, ha, hmmm. 
</P>
<P>
 How unfortunate that even with Hollywood's recent strides toward gay 
tolerance, it still spits out such insulting, insecure "entertainment."

 Carrey is a very talented comedian, which makes his choice of homophobia as a 
comedic element of Ace Ventura so tragic. Carrey says Ace's reaction to having 
kissed a man "is so ridiculous it can't be taken seriously" ("It's Zany and 
Aces With Fans," Feb. 18). Guess again. The clear message that comes across is 
that to be "cool" like Ace includes despising anything remotely homosexual, an 
attitude that leads to discrimination and condones physical violence against 
gays. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the message you put out, Mr. Carrey. Whatever your intentions may 
have been, we gays have Hollywood and you to thank for yet another message of 
hate insidiously buried in an otherwise delightful movie. What a waste, what a 
shame.

KISSIN AND COUGHIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I don't know whether Los Angeles concert audiences are the worst in the world, 
but they are certainly the worst I have ever experienced. At the Yevgeny Kissin 
recital at the Music Center on Feb. 20, the coughing was incessant, signal 
watches and pagers were beeping, cellular phones were ringing, there was 
endless shuffling and, of course, there was the ever-popular Los Angeles 
favorite, inappropriate clapping at every pause. 
</P>
<P>
 This appalling audience etiquette has become the norm and demonstrates a lack 
of respect for both the artists and fellow audience members. If Los Angeles 
wants to be the world-class city culturally that it now pretends to be, its 
audiences are going to have to undergo some behavior modification.

 Of Howard Stern, Rick Dees says: "He's the bully who pushes everyone around

mean-spirited. And I think there's a price to pay for it." Spare me. I know of 
at least three others, and I've never taken a poll, who have quit listening to 
Dees because of his meanness.

UNDESIRABLE 'CONCUBINE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a movie lover for many years, I strongly disagree with the Academy Award 
nomination in the foreign-language film category of the Hong Kong entry, 
"Farewell My Concubine" ("Oscar's Favorite List," Feb. 10).The film, upon which 
I wasted my money, is an ugly and sordid two hours and 36 minutes of cruelty: 
mutilation, beatings, humiliation, torture, murder, more beatings and then, at 
the end, an incomprehensible suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 A few conceivable reasons for the film's many awards to date are that it does 
have scope, ambition, overwrought passion and some powerful performances. 
However, this in no way makes it an artful film with logical story development 
or meaningful content.

LISTEN TO THE RAPPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Years ago Woody Guthrie used the traditional format of the "Talking Blues" to 
create "Talking Dust," "Talking Merchant Marine," "Talking Constitution" to 
express his anti-Establishment views. Later, Vern Partlow wrote "Old Man Atom," 
which ended with ". . .peace on the Earth or the Earth in pieces."Since then, 
many folk singers have used the format to express their own critiques of 
society -- the Vietnam War, the population explosion -- with great effect. 
Notably, these songs have been absent from the airwaves as "subversive" and 
"radical." 
</P>
<P>
 Now we have a new genre called rap, with its more extreme gangsta rap as an 
expression of the black ghettos ("Rap Finds a Supporter in Rep. Maxine Waters," 
Feb. 15), where the failure of society to address the real problems such as 
poverty and dysfunctional families has led to rage, violence and the widespread 
use of drugs. Is it any wonder that gangsta rap has developed as an expression 
of frustration? 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than ban it from the airways and record stores, wouldn't it be much 
more effective to listen to what its practitioners are trying to tell us and 
address the root causes of poverty, inadequate education and lack of 
opportunity? Wouldn't this channel the energy and rage of young people 
constructively? Banning gangsta rap will not make the problems it exposes go 
away!

DOLLARS AND THE ORCHESTRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with great interest the article detailing the financial troubles being 
experienced by the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra ("Tough Road Ahead for L.A. 
Chamber Orchestra," Feb. 15). 
</P>
<P>
 The article did not mention that the orchestra sometimes works in the pit for 
the Los Angeles Opera.Don't they get some compensation for that? 
</P>
<P>
 And here is a golden opportunity for our two major classical radio stations 
(KUSC-FM and KKGO-FM) to help save this orchestra by doing fund-raising. Both 
could spur listener interest in sending tax-deductible contributions ($5, $10, 
$15) to the orchestra. Maybe they could bring the conductor or members of the 
board to the stations to ask for support. To a lesser extent, KCSN-FM, KPFK-FM, 
KCRW-FM or others that program classical music on a part-time basis might also 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 And, if corporate people could see that there is community support, they might 
help as well.

TV REVIEW; GAPS IN EUROCENTRIC VIEW OF 20TH-CENTURY 'DANCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No matter how much dance you've seen, you'll discover archival treasures 
galore in "Dance of the Century," the five-part documentary that kicks off on 
Bravo cable today at 4 p.m. Sadly, much of this priceless footage has been cut 
to snippets to illustrate an arrogantly Eurocentric thesis on 20th-Century 
dance history. 
</P>
<P>
 Jump-cutting from dance performances to newsreel violence is the favorite 
method of writer-director Sonia Schoonejans to link cultural achievements with 
social and political events. These arbitrary juxtapositions prove crudely 
effective, but can't camouflage crucial gaps in her world view. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 20th Century has been an epoch in which major artists all over 
the world formed dance companies to display and preserve unique, imperiled 
traditions, you'll find no mention of such figures as Uday Shankar, Amalia 
Hernandez or even Igor Moiseyev in this 1992 European co-production. No, to 
Schoonejans, non-white cultures are only worth acknowledging when they directly 
influence European art. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, her view of America is similarly skewed in favor of expatriates who 
danced extensively in Europe or those U.S. choreographers who inspired 
Europeans in some way. So Karole Armitage looms larger than Paul Taylor in this 
"Century" and Katherine Dunham doesn't exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistranslations are frequent enough in the English narration (spoken by former 
Royal Ballet luminary Lynn Seymour) that some of the most bizarre statements 
may well be accidents. For instance, while we watch Terese Capucilli dance the 
Martha Graham role in "Errand Into the Maze," Seymour calls Graham's work the 
story of "a man lost in the labyrinth of the unconscious." A man? 
</P>
<P>
 Not so incidentally, Capucilli is never identified and neither are nearly all 
the dancers in the series. However, every archive and company that sold those 
dancers' images receives credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Below: capsule descriptions of the episodes with their initial Bravo airdates: 
</P>
<P>
 "From Romantic to Neoclassical Ballet" (today). Forget the outrageous 
misconceptions of Fokine, Ashton and Bejart -- or the way music has been badly 
synchronized with silent films. This account of the Diaghilev era and its 
aftermath contains invaluable footage of groundbreaking ballets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Abstract Ballet: From Academical to Classical Abstraction" (next Saturday). 
Taking a revealing approach to familiar material, this episode focuses on 
George Balanchine but pointedly shows what happened under the Soviets to those 
artists who were his early influences and colleagues in Russia. Yet beware: 
According to Schoonejans, the inheritor of the Balanchine aesthetic is 
Frankfurt maverick William Forsythe. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "From Free Dance to Dance Theatre: German Expressionism" (June 18). The least 
familiar subject to American audiences, this fascinating survey of the careers 
of Rudolf von Laban, Mary Wigman and Kurt Jooss shows dance and history really 
intersecting -- for once validating Schoonejans' approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "From Modernism to Post-Modernism: American Dance" (June 25). Full of clips 
that contradict Schoonejans' conclusions, this highly warped consideration of 
U.S. innovation at least provides a useful souvenir of choreographers in her 
pantheon -- notably Lucinda Childs and Trisha Brown.  
</P>
<P>
 "Contemporary Dance: The Explosion" (July 2). Directed by Luc Riolon, this 
delirious compendium of Eurotrash attempts to place France in the forefront of 
new choreography, but lacks the evidence. An unyielding obsession with gesture, 
character-dance technique and the exaltation of eccentricity just isn't enough 
to crown 96 years of dance achievement -- not even when hyped by narration so 
overblown it qualifies as neo-biblical.

TV REVIEWS; MUPPETS COME TO LIFE IN 'TOYS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Muppets: 10. Magic: 0. "The Secret Life of Toys," the latest television series 
from Jim Henson Productions, beginning at 8:30 this morning on the Disney 
Channel, isn't short on Muppet variety.It is short on the kind of wit and 
artistry that have infused other Muppet endeavors, most notably "Sesame Street" 
and "The Muppet Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Imagining that toys can come to life when their owners' backs are turned is a 
favorite childhood fantasy. Judging from the first two frenetic, 12-minute 
episodes of this series, however, the "secret life" of toys is primarily a 
near-hysterical fear of discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first episode, "Oops!," the toys' owners, a young girl and boy, have 
set up an elaborate, rope-and-box trick that will shower their cousin with 
plastic spiders when he opens the door. When they leave the playroom, a sneeze 
from hobby horse Hortense dismantles the trap and the toys scramble to put it 
back in place. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second episode, "Don't Tell Me," Rugby Tiger gets himself locked 
outside the playroom, while the other toys frantically try to get him back 
inside before the children return. 
</P>
<P>
 Each show comes with heavy-handed messages about cooperation, self-esteem, 
etc., while Hortense has moaning anxiety attacks and Rugby's carelessness and 
reluctance to listen exacerbate the crisis. This is not the stuff of dreams. 
Not happy ones, that is. LYNNE HEFFLEY

TV REVIEWS; 'DUCKMAN' CREATED AS AN ADULT CARTOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The latest entry in the "adult" (i.e. gross) cartoon sweepstakes, "Duckman: 
Private Detective/Family Man," premiering at 10:30 tonight on the USA cable 
channel, is so far out in left field, it's behind the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a comic strip by illustrator Everett Peck, the cranky central 
character (voice by Jason Alexander) is equally ineffectual as a private eye 
and a father.His immediate circle includes his shrewish sister-in-law, Bernice 
(Nancy Travis); his lumpish son, Ajax (Dweezil Zappa); his argumentative, 
two-headed son Charles/Mambo (Dana Hill/E.G. Daily); a flatulent, comatose 
mother-in-law and his phlegmatic partner-pig, Cornfed (Gregg Berger). Calling 
this clan "dysfunctional" would be flattery. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Groening describes "The Simpsons" as "a family who love each other and 
drive each other crazy, which is something we can all identify with." Viewers 
may have a tougher time generating much sympathy for the alienated Duckman, who 
alternately complains and takes pot shots at PC targets. He's Archie Bunker in 
a script by Bret Easton Ellis. CHARLES SOLOMON

TV REVIEWS; NEW FOOTAGE ON 'SURVIVING' QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe it's a case of watching too much PBS programming, but one of the first 
thoughts that crossed my mind after the ground stopped shaking on Jan. 17 was, 
"What happened to Henry Johnson?" 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson is The Man on earthquake preparedness -- at least to those of us who 
probably watch too much PBS programming. His KCET-produced "Surviving the Big 
One," originally made after the Whittier quake, has set the standard by which 
other earthquake-safety TV programs are measured, because former firefighter 
Johnson personalized the information and demonstrated how his family prepared. 
He even pointed out a growing crack running under his Northridge home -- that's 
right, Northridge. So, on Jan. 17, did the home come crashing down? 
</P>
<P>
 No, Johnson told The Times a few days after the temblor. But there seemed to 
be new lessons from the Northridge quake, and Johnson has added approximately 
10 minutes of new footage to "Surviving" (on KCET-TV Channel 28 at 3 p.m. today 
and repeating at noon on March 20). 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's primer is now no longer alone, nor is it exactly comprehensive. 
KCBS-TV Channel 2's "On Solid Ground" is rich with post-quake recovery tips, 
while home expert Kitty Bartholomew's special for KCET's "Life and Times" 
series, "Quick Fixes and Quake Safe," provides numerous suggestions for 
securing household items and making repairs. Both offer information missing 
from Johnson's guide, making them essential and complementary parts of an 
earthquake-safety video package. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither have Johnson's charisma nor his overwhelming twin messages that A) 
The Big One is survivable and that B) preparation begins today. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his new material addresses the recent disaster; some of it doesn't. 
Most useful are generic tips ranging from stocking several days' worth of water 
to arranging a drill with children to ride out a quake in bed. Neither Johnson 
-- nor any of those other preparedness reports -- addresses the troubling 
evidence that steel-reinforced structures didn't endure the recent quake as 
well as expected. Nor do they tell the viewer about the latest items to secure 
heavy home equipment and where to purchase them. 
</P>
<P>
 But for viewers not acquainted with Johnson's guide, this is still the place 
to start on the road to seismic sanity. ROBERT KOEHLER

TV REVIEWS; DOCUMENTING THE LIFE OF 'TOMMY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Go to the adding machine, boy: No work of modern art has enjoyed a trajectory 
quite like "Tommy's" -- from hit pop record album to motion picture to Broadway 
musical, with lesser stops as ballet and symphony production in between, and 
nearly a quarter-century separating its first and last major incarnations. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour almost doesn't seem quite long enough, then, for "The Who's Tommy: The 
Amazing Journey," a first-rate special that does a -- no pun intended -- 
smashing job of documenting Pete Townshend's rock opera in all its variations. 
(It airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on the Disney Channel; this being a "free preview" 
weekend, it's available to all cable subscribers.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The Who were a singles band," says Townshend, figuring "it was my inability 
to come up with a song that was better than 'I Can See for Miles' that stopped 
me in my tracks" and triggered him to attempt writing a full-length narrative. 
It proved one of rock's most brilliantly conceived and executed albums, both 
for its enduring wealth of memorable individual melodies and its concepts. 
Psychological denial and memory repression, fleeting messianism both pop and 
religious -- these are themes (and tunes) that don't date. 
</P>
<P>
 The hour has as much fatuousness as you'd expect, but also a good amount of 
anecdotes and cheek -- like Townshend remembering his strenuous objection to 
casting Jack Nicholson in the movie; Roger Daltrey and John Entwhistle implying 
doubts about the un-rock-'n'-roll-ness of a stage musical; the Broadway 
choreographer frustratedly pointing out how few down beats there are to dance 
to in the thunderous drumming set down by Keith Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end, Elton John proclaims a "culmination" for Townshend's work, 
saying: "After 25 years he's finally found the perfect vehicle for it, which is 
the stage." That's extremely arguable for rock fans who may find a certain 
amount of hokum in the latest adaptation, yet its success bodes inarguably well 
for interactivity between the arts and pop as potentially in disposable after 
all. CHRIS WILLMAN

STENCILS MAKE THEIR MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VALERIE ORLEANS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stenciling leaves its mark on a room like a whisper, making a quiet suggestion 
rather than a loud announcement yet often managing to be one of the most 
interesting things a room has to say. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny dabs of paint that characterize stenciling can be applied in ways 
that are appropriate to an array of design styles -- from the most streamlined 
to the most intricate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stenciling is a wonderful way to complement a certain look, and it is easy to 
do," said Marilyn Harmon, a stenciling instructor. "It gives you a wonderful 
sense of accomplishment and is easily adaptable. Many people start by painting 
a border near the ceiling, go on to their cabinets and then start painting 
furniture or curtains to match. The basic technique is the same, so it's a 
matter of practicing and determining what looks best. 
</P>
<P>
 "The charm of stenciling lies in its personalization," Harmon said. "You can 
create looks that are very romantic, contemporary or traditional." 
</P>
<P>
 Harmon, who teaches stenciling at Piecemakers Country Store in Costa Mesa, and 
her partner, Brenda Stanfield, have been giving classes for about 10 years. 
There has been an increased interest in the craft over the past decade, they 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just 12 years ago, the number of pre-cut stencils were very small," Harmon 
said. "Today, there are literally thousands of patterns to choose from, and 
stencilers also have the option of cutting their own stencils." 
</P>
<P>
 In its simplest form, stenciling is the art of applying paint through a 
cut-out pattern to areas ranging from walls to furniture to fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 16th and 17th centuries, stenciling achieved great popularity in 
Europe. In fact, the origins of the word can be traced back to either the 
French estenceler, meaning to sparkle, or Latin scintilla, meaning to spark. 
The French were fond of adding sparkling decorations to their homes during this 
period and adorned wallpaper, books and fabrics. Immigrants brought the craft 
to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, it is used by do-it-yourselfers and professionals to add interest to 
walls, furnishings and even clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 When interior designer Elaine Hankin of Huntington Beach wanted to create a 
cozy, Pennsylvania Dutch-style look for a client's home, she turned to 
stenciling. 
</P>
<P>
 "My client has a very contemporary condominium in Irvine with a very high 
ceiling," Hankin said. "We wanted to bring the ceiling down while adding some 
warmth. With stark white walls, what do you do? That's why we thought of 
stenciling." 
</P>
<P>
 Borrowing from the Pennsylvania Dutch theme, Hankin had an artist stencil hex 
patterns across the walls of the family room and kitchen.  
</P>
<P>
 "I really like the look of faux finishes whether it's stenciling, marbleizing 
or sponging," Hankin said. "I use stenciling all the time. It's extremely 
versatile, so if I'm decorating the bedroom, I can pick up a pattern from a 
quilt or draperies. I can also match the colors much better than if I tried 
wallpaper or another treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 Hankin also likes stenciling to add subtle touches to an area, such as ivy 
trailing around a doorway. For a more bold look, she once used dolphins and 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used a fish motif because this particular client really enjoyed fishing. 
It was a fun and relatively inexpensive way to personalize his home and add a 
sense of fun," she said. "The stenciling I've had done always looks great, and 
you really get a lot of bang for your buck." 
</P>
<P>
 When determining an area to stencil, Harmon recommends looking at the size of 
the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "A stencil with a large pattern will overpower a small room," she said. 
"Likewise, a small pattern can sometimes get lost in a large room. Stenciling 
should be a part of the whole look you are trying to achieve." 
</P>
<P>
 The stenciling process itself is relatively simple. Once a pattern and colors 
have been selected, the stenciler should first try out the arrangement on a 
piece of paper that is, preferably, the color of the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can practice blending or combining different colors to see the effect," 
Stanfield said. "Beginners have a tendency to apply paint that's too dark or 
thick. By looking at different patterns and colors on paper, you can tape them 
to the surface and see how it will look. That way, if it's not what you had in 
mind, you can easily change the pattern or colors." 
</P>
<P>
 Harmon and Stanfield recommend starting your pattern in a corner that's least 
likely to be seen, usually near the doorway. And start with a clean surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Assess whether the ceiling or walls are even. This isn't as important if the 
pattern is a flowing, winding one (such as ivy or a grapevine), but could cause 
difficulty if it has straight lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The stencil can be affixed to the wall with masking tape and easily removed as 
the stenciler works around the room. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two types of paint used for stenciling: oil-based and acrylic. 
Oil-based paints are usually sold as crayons or in small pots. The acrylics 
tend to be sold in larger jars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stencil crayons are oil paints in a wax crayon base," Harmon said. "They 
are a good medium for beginners because there's little chance of runovers, 
where paint gets underneath the stencil and can leave marks or smudges. 
However, you also need to be careful to not apply the crayon too heavily, or it 
can smear." 
</P>
<P>
 With the crayons, the stenciler can apply the color to a piece of wax paper 
and, with a special stenciling brush, take the paint from the wax paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "You shouldn't use the crayon directly against the wall or against your brush 
either," Stanfield said. "One of the biggest problems beginners face is 
applying too much paint to the surface. You need only a small amount on the tip 
of the brush." 
</P>
<P>
 Paint should be lightly applied to the surface with a circular motion. If the 
wall or surface is textured, stencilers should instead lightly tap against the 
area to be colored, a process know as stippling. Additional colors can be 
blended in, depending on the look the stenciler wishes to attain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, you'll start with the lightest colors first and work out to the 
darker colors," Stanfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 A paintbrush designed for stenciling should be used. These brushes feature 
bristles that are tightly bound together and can withstand being tapped against 
the surface rather than being stroked. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the job easier, it's also helpful to have one brush for each color. 
This eliminates the need to clean the brushes every time the stencil is moved. 
The size of the brush should be determined by the stencil itself. Fine, 
detailed areas require a smaller brush. Harmon recommends natural-hair bristles 
rather than nylon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nylon can make it difficult to blend colors," she said. "It's like trying to 
paint with a whisk broom." 
</P>
<P>
 The same general techniques apply to painting with acrylics; however, 
stencilers should be careful to ensure that they don't get too much paint on 
the brush. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm stenciling, I just dip the end of the brush into the top of the 
paint lid," Stanfield said. "Then I dab the excess paint on a paper towel. With 
acrylics, you'll use what is called a 'dry brush' approach. The brush shouldn't 
be wet with paint because then you'll see the brush strokes, and there's a 
greater chance of smearing. It may seem like I have hardly any paint at all on 
the brush, but there's enough." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who would like a tablecloth or curtains to match the stenciling in 
the room, the techniques are virtually the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cotton works best," Harmon said. "Be sure to pre-wash fabric to get the 
sizing out. Most fabrics are treated with sizing to help them resist stains. 
If, however, you stencil a tablecloth before washing, you'll end up stenciling 
the sizing. After the first washing, your paint will either come out or fade. 
You also don't want to use fabric softeners on stenciled items as the softener 
will cover the fibers and diminish the colors." 
</P>
<P>
 The versatility of stenciling is reflected in the increased interest in it 
that Harmon and Stanfield have seen over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not an exact art, though, and that is part of what gives it personality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each stencil looks a little different because of the blending and colors. 
Yet, after you've done one pattern 50 times, you'd be surprised at how close 
the blending and colors become. 
</P>
<P>
 Stenciling is definitely a user-friendly decorating technique. It's easy to 
learn, and the more you practice, the better and easier it gets, Harmon said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy and affordable and can really make a place look great," she said. 
</P>

HOME IMPROVEMENT; REFERRAL SERVICES HELP TAKE GUESSWORK OUT OF HIRING 
CONTRACTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAT GERBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anyone who's ever searched for a contractor or handyman to do a 
home-improvement job knows that finding the right person often takes longer 
than the task itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Does any of this sound familiar?  
</P>
<P>
 You talk to friends, who talk to other friends, until you find someone living 
next door to your neighbor's third cousin who actually knows how to lay a wood 
floor. But the guy's booked up for three months, then he's going fishing in 
Cabo San Lucas, so maybe by Thanksgiving . . . 
</P>
<P>
 You try cold-calling from the phone book, but every time you find an ad that 
looks legitimate, the number's been disconnected . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, you reach a painter who doesn't sound confused when you start talking 
about faux finishes. Only you wish you had been sitting down when she quoted 
the price . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Now you know why your next-door neighbor hasn't bothered to do any landscaping 
for the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 All this frustration has given rise to a new niche of businesses: home 
improvement matchmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of these services act as meeting broker between homeowners and 
contractors. Relatively new to the county -- the oldest is going on its eighth 
year in business -- the services have names such as Job Well Done or Home 
Improvement Referrals. One is operated as an adjunct service to a building 
materials retail chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The services basically work like this: They keep a list of workers whose 
references and job histories have been checked out (each does it a bit 
differently). They also check to make sure the worker has a contractor's 
license, when applicable, and carries insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, an appointment is made so the homeowner can check this person out for 
themselves, estimates are quoted, billing arrangements set and contracts 
signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the services also have some kind of follow-up procedure to find out if 
the work was completed to the homeowner's satisfaction.  
</P>
<P>
 The matchmaking services typically get their money by charging the contractors 
a fee to be included in the listings or by getting a percentage of the bill 
from the contractor. All say customer satisfaction is important to the success 
of their business because they rely heavily on return business or referrals. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the services operating in Orange County and what they offer: 
Home Improvement Referrals 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Felton, who heads this Newport Beach outfit, says she has about 45 
workers who pay her anywhere from $300 to $500, plus a small percentage of the 
homeowner's bill, to be included in her membership. They range from a guy who 
cleans driveways to structural engineers, architects and a contractor who 
builds custom homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Before including someone new in her roster, Felton says she interviews at 
least 15, sometimes 25, of their customers, figuring that that many references 
can't all be family and friends. "We are strict and selective," she says, and 
everyone has to be licensed, except for those who do simple jobs that don't 
require one. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the category of work and availability, Felton typically sends two 
people from her roster to bid on a job. She follows up the work with calls to 
the customer to make sure all went well. If she gets complaints about any of 
her contractors, she drops them. 
</P>
<P>
 Felton started the business after losing her teaching job to school budget 
cuts. She owned rental properties with her husband, and she was in charge of 
property improvements. But finding reliable help had always been a 
time-consuming task. After reading about an entrepreneur's contractor service, 
she decided to start one of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 Felton says she hears horror stories all the time from people who have had bad 
experiences with contractors. Some people were left hanging when a contractor 
exited in mid-repair and never showed up again, while others have complained 
about shoddy work. 
</P>
<P>
 Felton says that doesn't happen to her customers, because her livelihood 
depends on screening out those who are unlikely to perform as promised; she 
estimates that repeat calls from satisfied customers constitute 50% of her 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Improvement Referrals , 2801 West Coast Highway, Suite 350, Newport 
Beach. (714) 348-8350. Job Well Done 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really about quality, not being the cheapest," says Nadine Petropoulos, 
who started her Laguna Niguel home-based referral service almost six years ago. 
The company takes pride in not charging contractors a fee, but rather makes its 
money by getting a percentage of the final bill from the contractor. 
Petropoulos considers this an important distinction from services that require 
contractors to pay to join a roster. Her workers stand solely on merit, she 
says, not on their ability to buy a membership. 
</P>
<P>
 The service has a roster of 75 people who do everything from big remodeling 
jobs to painting to hardscapes to window washing to antique repair. One 
contractor, who has been in the area 20 years, builds multimillion-dollar 
homes. Although most of her work is with South County customers, Petropoulos 
has sent contractors on jobs as far away as Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 Petropoulos also employs a screening process that includes scrutinizing 
training and work history. She looks for people who have been working in Orange 
County for at least five years, then she conducts personal interviews to gauge 
professional appearance. She checks references and also checks their work, 
inspecting the job herself when possible. She figures that in the five years 
she's been in business, she can count only five times when people were not 
satisfied with a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Contractors referred through her are required to carry workman's compensation 
if they have employees working for them on a site, and they have to show proof 
of bond. 
</P>
<P>
 Before starting her business, Petropoulos was a national marketing director 
for a Chicago-based insurance company. Part of her job required that she manage 
and supervise construction, from ground up, of the company's office buildings. 
When her husband was transferred to Orange County, she had to find contractors 
to do work on their new home; starting a contractor referral service seemed 
like a natural segue.

 She encourages those contemplating hiring a contractor to get three bids on 
the job and then throw out the high one and the low one. "It's important to 
know that the cheapest bid is not necessarily the best way to go. Bad 
workmanship is more costly down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 If you need work done around the house, winter is the best time to do it, she 
adds. Work is slow, so you're likely to get the best bids, and you probably 
won't have to wait weeks to schedule it.

 This franchise operation, based in Atlanta, has been in business on the East 
Coast and in the South for about three decades. The Mounce-Meech family -- a 
mother, daughter and father -- opened the first West Coast office about a year 
ago in Laguna Hills. (There is also now a Sherman Oaks franchise office.) It is 
among about 30 offices nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The business is based on consumer membership, which is free the first year and 
costs $25 annually thereafter. Membership buys access to the services of about 
60 people, seven days a week, 24 hours a day, and a guarantee that all work is 
done to the customer's satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Payments are made to the company, then a representative verifies that the job 
is done correctly before the contractor is paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Members also receive a quarterly newsletter and coupons for money off on 
services or products from local retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 The franchise's service area covers all of South Orange County -- considered a 
high-growth area -- from the Costa Mesa Freeway to the San Diego County line. 
Vice president-mom Chris Mounce says many of their customers are home buyers 
referred through real estate agents (she used to be one).

ASK THE HANDYMAN / JOHN MORELL: PICTURE-PERFECT SPOTS ARE LEFT BY REMOVAL

 Question: I've moved some pictures around my house and have patched and 
repaired the walls where I've taken down pictures. Where I painted the spots 
I've worked on, there's a significant difference in color between the patched 
area and the rest of the wall, even though I used the same paint. What's wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 M.F. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: "Over time, you'll find that the paint on a wall will oxidize and 
change slightly in tone," says a representative of Tustin Paint Mart. 
</P>
<P>
 "This can be due just to aging, or it can also be affected by smoking, steam, 
etc. Also, many people don't store their extra paint correctly. You should 
clean the rim on the can and the lid and secure it tightly. Otherwise, the 
inside of the can could get rusty, which will affect the paint color. When 
painting over a spot, you'll almost always see a difference between the new and 
old paint. The only way to prevent that is to paint the entire wall as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We bought an old house that has a porch with a wood-plank floor. The floor 
has been painted numerous times over the years, and I'd love to strip it down 
and stain the flooring. What would be involved? 
</P>
<P>
 E.E. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 A: "You're looking at a very involved job," says Jim Craig of Decratrend 
Paints in Anaheim. "First, you'll have to remove the old coats of paint with a 
sander, some type of solvent or a combination of both. This is the hardest job, 
since the floor is likely to be a large surface area, and it's tough work 
getting every bit of old paint off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once that's done, the floor must be repaired and sanded, and you'll have to 
use a type of patch that will mix with the new stain." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We have a 29-year-old gas furnace with a pilot light that frequently goes 
out, even though it's operating perfectly fine otherwise. Any ideas? 
</P>
<P>
 P.D. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 A: "This is often a symptom of a crack in the furnace firebox," says Joel 
Gwartz of B.J. Discount Plumbing & Heating Supply in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could also mean that the vent cap on the roof may be off, allowing drafts 
inside that extinguish the pilot. Also, some brands are poorly designed and the 
pilots regularly go out on them. If you can see that the vent cap is in place, 
it may be time to bring a repairman in to locate the cause." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Our gas barbecue has some horrible grease stains on the cover that have 
burned in place. Is there any way to get rid of them? 
</P>
<P>
 A.S. 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia 
</P>
<P>
 A: "You could try a degreaser that's similar to an oven cleaner," says metal 
polisher Steve Garum. "They're available at most barbecue stores; you just 
spray it on and wipe it off. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should also try using a solution of vinegar and water and wash the 
barbecue down with a sponge. This will remove any hard deposits that may have 
built up around the joints and make the lid easier to open and close." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I'm planning on putting mini-blinds in all of my windows, and I'm not sure 
how to measure for them. Do I have to allow for the size of the hardware? 
</P>
<P>
 W.D. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 A: "Use a tape measure and a helper if they're large windows," says installer 
Dave Brown of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get the exact measurement, both horizontally and vertically, of the frame. 
Measure it at different points to see if there's a slant to the frame. The 
manufacturer takes into account the size of the hardware, and they will make a 
blind to fit according to your measurements."

MAINTENANCE; ELBOW GREASE AND POLISH MAKE METALS SHINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can choose from a variety of commercial metal polishes, or even make your 
own, to bring back the sparkle in copper, brass, pewter or silver. 
</P>
<P>
 Most commercial polishes contain tarnish retardants, so they help maintain a 
shine as well as remove tarnish. To avoid damaging the finish, you'll want to 
choose a polish designed especially for the metal that needs cleaning. After 
cleaning, be sure to buff or wash away all polish because any traces will 
hasten tarnishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some specific cleaning and polishing tips: 
</P>
<P>
 Brass and Copper 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't use polish of any type on lacquered objects. Wash them in lukewarm 
sudsy water; rinse; dry, and buff with a soft cloth. 
</P>
<P>
 * For unlacquered bright finishes, wash in hot sudsy water and rinse. Apply 
brass or copper polish with a soft cloth or brush. Let the polish dry 
thoroughly, then buff with a soft clean cloth. 
</P>
<P>
 * For dull finishes, mix rottenstone and linseed oil (available from hardware 
stores) to form a heavy cream. Apply with a soft cloth and rub vigorously. Wipe 
off the excess, then polish with a soft clean cloth. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you prefer to make your own polish, you can clean slightly tarnished 
copper or brass by mixing equal parts of salt, vinegar and flour. Rub the paste 
on with a soft cloth. Because salt is corrosive, be sure to rinse the piece 
thoroughly before buffing it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rub stubborn stains with salt and vinegar or lemon juice. Or rub them with a 
piece of lemon dipped in hot vinegar and salt. Wash, rinse and dry. If this 
fails, use a commercial polish. Pewter 
</P>
<P>
 Modern pewter (also called Brittania metal) is an alloy of tin, antimony and 
copper. It resists tarnish quite well and usually needs only an occasional 
washing in warm, soapy water. Rinse well and dry thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 Dust and burnish old pewter with a soft cloth. If the tin and lead in it cause 
a brown tarnish, remove it with a bath in washing soda. If necessary, rub the 
surface with extra-fine (grade 000) steel wool dipped in vegetable oil. Because 
of the lead content, don't eat or drink from old pewter utensils. 
</P>
<P>
 You can polish modern and old pewter with commercial pewter cleaners or make 
your own modern pewter restorer with ingredients from the hardware store. For a 
duller matte, mix rottenstone and vegetable oil. For brighter matte finishes, 
apply a paste of pumice and water. Apply either paste with a soft cloth and rub 
gently. For shiny pewter, use automobile polish and follow label directions. Or 
mix a paste of powdered whiting and denatured alcohol. When the paste is dry, 
polish with a clean, soft cloth. Silverware 
</P>
<P>
 Fine silver should be used frequently, not packed away for special occasions. 
Continual use enhances its beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 * As soon as silver flatware has been cleared from the table, wash it in hot 
sudsy water, then rinse it in clear hot water. 
</P>
<P>
 * To prevent water-spotting, don't allow silverware to air-dry. Dry with a 
lint-free towel. 
</P>
<P>
 * Antique or oxidized silverware may not be dishwasher-safe. Hot water can 
loosen hollow handles on antique (or even modern) flatware and may dissolve a 
decorative oxidized pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dip polishes will also remove an oxidized pattern. Use a commercial cream or 
paste polish instead. 
</P>
<P>
 * The outer layer of a silver-plated item is soft and thin. Avoid harsh 
rubbing and frequent polishing. Use a dip polish instead. 
</P>
<P>
 * To clean tarnish from the edges of fork tines, rub them with a string coated 
with silver polish.

EXTERIORS; PAINTED MASONRY'S PAST IS WRITTEN IN THE STONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stone and brick on the outside of a house lend a charm all their own. And 
while some prefer the natural look, others go for painting their masonry. One 
problem to be aware of is that, once masonry is painted, it is difficult to 
restore to its original condition. 
</P>
<P>
 There will always be particles of paint left in the texture of the brickwork, 
and even smooth stone, which can be stripped successfully, may be stained by 
paint. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to cleaning old brick and masonry in preparation for finishing a 
wall or leaving it natural, first brush off all loose debris with a 
stiff-bristled brush. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't use a wire brush unless the masonry is badly soiled, because the wire 
brush may leave scratch marks. Remove dirt and dust by washing the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Scrub heavy deposits with a half-cup of ammonia added to a bucket of water. 
Abrade small cement stains or other marks from brickwork with a piece of 
similar-colored brick, or scrub the area with a household cleanser. 
</P>
<P>
 New brickwork or stonework should be left for about three months until it is 
completely dry before any further treatment is considered. 
</P>
<P>
 White powdery deposits called efflorescence may come to the surface over this 
period. These are soluble salts within the building materials that gradually 
migrate to the surface as a wall dries. The same condition can occur on old 
masonry if it is subjected to more than average moisture. 
</P>
<P>
 Efflorescence itself is not harmful, but the source of moisture causing it 
must be identified and cured if the surface is to remain unstained. 
</P>
<P>
 Regularly brush the deposit from the wall with a dry, stiff-bristled brush 
until the crystals cease to form. Don't attempt to wash off the crystals, 
because they'll merely dissolve and soak back into the wall. Above all, don't 
attempt to paint a wall that is still efflorescing, and therefore damp. 
</P>
<P>
 When the wall is completely dry, paint the surface with an alkali-resistant 
primer to neutralize the effect of the crystals before you paint with oil 
paint. Water-thinned paints or clear sealants let the wall breathe and so are 
not affected by the alkali content of the masonry. Most exterior latex paints 
can be used without primer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mold growth on masonry is another problem you may have to deal with. Molds and 
lichen will flourish only in damp conditions, so try to cure the source of the 
problem before treating the growth. 
</P>
<P>
 If one side of the house always faces away from the sun, it will have little 
chance to dry. Relieve the situation by cutting back overhanging trees or 
shrubs to increase ventilation to the wall. Make sure the earth surrounding 
masonry is graded so surface water flows away from it. 
</P>
<P>
 To remove growth, brush the wall with a stiff-bristled brush. Microscopic 
spores will remain even after brushing. You'll have to kill these with a 
solution of one part household bleach in four parts of water. Paint on the 
solution and let it sit for 48 hours before washing it off. A second 
application may be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 If this doesn't do the trick, use a fungicide available at home centers. Apply 
the fungicide and let it sit for 24 hours before washing it off with water.

HEARTH AND SOUL; WHETHER CONTEMPORARY OR ANTIQUE, A MANTELPIECE ADDS A WARMTH 
OF ITS OWN TO A ROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For centuries the fireplace was our source of heat and light, the place we 
cooked meals, warmed quilts, dried clothes, read books, the place the family 
met in the morning and gathered at the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, we may get heat from a gas furnace and light from an electric current, 
but a crackling fire still has a magnetism that is hard to resist. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes a home comes with just the right one, sometimes not. Increasingly, 
homeowners seem willing to change a mantelpiece to reflect their tastes, 
whether contemporary, traditional or antique. 
</P>
<P>
 Designer and author Alexandra Stoddard knows firsthand the difference a 
mantelpiece can make. When she married, she and her furniture moved into a Park 
Avenue apartment. The apartment was roomy and handsome, but Stoddard quickly 
discovered that the 1920s English-style painted mantel that dominated the 
living room was at odds with her own light and airy French Provincial style. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proportions looked all wrong," she says. "The mantel just towered over 
the furniture." Her solution was a direct one: Instead of trying to make the 
furniture she loved fit the architecture, she changed the architecture to fit 
the furniture, replacing the English mantel with an antique French one. 
Stripped and bleached, the new mantel transformed the room. 
</P>
<P>
 But that fabulous mantel is not always so easy to find. Too often the style is 
right but the size is wrong. Or the size is right, but the materials are wrong. 
And when everything is right, the price may be way over budget -- a good 
antique mantel can cost $6,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where reproduction mantelpieces can come to the rescue. With a 
reproduction, you not only have a wide selection of styles to choose from, but 
you also can often dictate size and proportion. "For many people, choosing a 
reproduction is a matter of simply not being able to find the right antique," 
says Sylvia Bianchi, West Coast manager of Danny Alessandro Ltd., a company 
that deals in both antique and reproduction mantels. 
</P>
<P>
 Mantelpieces, as we know them, date to the 17th and early 18th centuries, when 
European architects began borrowing designs from classical Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 "There weren't fireplace surrounds in ancient Rome, so what the architects did 
was adapt the whole notion of door and window frames," explains John Bivins, an 
architectural historian and woodcarver. "A mantel is essentially the shelf at 
the top of a door frame with an entablature underneath. The overmantel is a 
window." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of today's reproduction mantelpieces fall into three broad style 
categories: English, Federal or American and French. 
</P>
<P>
 English mantels, inspired by 18th- and early 19th-century originals, tend to 
be formal and ornate, and often sport carvings of fruit, flowers or seashells. 
Federal mantels are plainer, with more austere geometric decorations. French 
mantels are often softly curved. French reproductions are available in both 
wood and cast stone, a molded material made of stone dust. 
</P>
<P>
 A true reproduction mantel is taken line for line from an antique model. The 
Winterthur Museum, for instance, has commissioned Driwood Moulding, a South 
Carolina company, to produce exact copies of the mantel and overmantel from its 
famous Port Royal Parlor. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Alessandro Ltd. and the William H. Jackson Co., which deal in antique 
mantels, both offer reproductions based on pieces from their collections. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically a mantel is between 54 and 60 inches high with a 42-to 55-inch 
opening, but wood mantels can be custom-ordered in different sizes. Although 
these are not true reproductions in the strictest sense, adaptations are a real 
help if you have an unusual fireplace opening to fit or an awkwardly shaped 
room. Once you've selected a mantel style, the company will help you through 
the ordering process, which is relatively easy. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're ordering a wood mantel, you'll have a choice of several finishes, or 
no finish at all. The only measurements needed are that of the firebox opening, 
but you should mention any nearby windows, architectural elements or other 
limitations that may affect the size of the mantel shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 Another important consideration -- one that did not trouble our ancestors -- 
is building codes, which can sometimes be met only by a custom-size design. 
(Some codes require, for instance, at least seven inches of non-flammable 
surround between the fireplace opening and the wood mantel.) 
</P>
<P>
 If you can't find what you need in catalogues of existing reproductions, some 
companies will work from photographs to make a copy. You can decide just how 
close to the original you want, but remember that the price goes up sharply if 
the manufacturer can't use stock components. 
</P>
<P>
 A beautiful fireplace warms a room in any season. And a good reproduction has 
a special glow, linking us to the days when the hearth was truly the heart of 
the home.

3 ARRESTED IN CRACKDOWN ON QUAKE AID SCAMS; INVESTIGATION: FEDERAL TASK FORCE 
TARGETS THOSE WHO ALLEGEDLY CLAIMED FALSELY TO HAVE LIVED AT NORTHRIDGE 
MEADOWS. A STORE OWNER IS ACCUSED OF FRAUDULENTLY SEEKING A $1.5-MILLION SBA 
LOAN.

<P>
 Moving against the latest earthquake aid scam, federal agents on Friday 
arrested three suspects and were seeking a fourth who allegedly sought 
thousands of dollars in emergency relief by falsely claiming to have lived at 
the disaster's deadliest address, the collapsed Northridge Meadows apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those arrested, Miguel Cordero of Panorama City, filed a Federal 
Emergency Management Agency claim using the apartment number where mechanic Pil 
Soon Lee and his 14-year-old son Hwon were crushed to death, officials charged 
in a criminal complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Another person falsely claimed to have lived part-time in a first-floor 
apartment where a 52-year-old man died, officials said. In all, 16 people were 
killed when the building collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Nora Manella said there was a "particularly ghoulish aspect" to the 
fraud involving the Northridge Meadows apartments. "It appears disaster brings 
out both the best and the worst in people." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agents also arrested a Calabasas convenience store owner, Siamek 
Kohanoff, who was charged with filing a fraudulent application for a 
$1.5-million Small Business Administration loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests, the first made by a multi-agency task force that is investigating 
quake-related fraud, were intended to signal that law enforcement agencies are 
serious about pursuing opportunists who take advantage of the flood of quake 
relief aid programs, authorities from several agencies said at a Downtown news 
conference.  
</P>
<P>
 Citing the "despicable nature of these crimes and the potential for 
large-scale fraud," the FBI is giving quake scams a top priority, said Charles 
J. Parsons, the special agent in charge of the Los Angeles office.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials say they are digging out from an avalanche of more than 400,000 aid 
applications -- a record for a U.S. disaster -- and are entering them in 
computers, cross-checking information and identifying questionable claims. Many 
more investigations, involving an array of relief programs, are under way and 
more arrests could be made in the weeks ahead, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at the very beginning of FEMA's effort to combat abuse," said Paul L. 
Lillis, the relief agency's assistant inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities stressed that the vast majority of the more than $500 million in 
grants, loans and housing assistance disbursed thus far appears to have gone to 
deserving victims. Lillis said it does not appear that the fraud rate in the 
Northridge quake is higher than normal, or that the huge number of claims is 
unexpected, given that the disaster struck a densely populated area. 
</P>
<P>
 Lillis also said he had never encountered fraudulent claims involving 
residences where disaster victims had been killed. Those charged Friday with 
filing false FEMA applications made their claims by telephone in the early days 
after the quake, apparently using the Northridge Meadows address because it had 
been reported frequently in the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 Three -- Cordero, Denise Jones of Carson and Mary Mitchell of Paramount -- 
received $2,300 checks. The fourth, Daniel Richards of Hollywood, did not 
receive a check, although in a follow-up interview he allegedly affirmed to 
agents posing as relief workers that his claim was accurate. Public defenders 
assigned to Cordero, Jones and Richards declined to comment. Mitchell was still 
being sought Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordero had been living in a rented apartment on Tobias Avenue in Panorama 
City since July, according to building manager Kevin Raye Larson. Cordero had 
told Larson and others in the building that he was a full-time student at Cal 
State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 All of those charged could face five-year prison terms and $250,000 fines if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the checks issued apparently went out without normal inspections and 
verification, as part of an effort to get aid swiftly to the most severely 
affected areas. Lillis of FEMA defended the decision to expedite the 
assistance, saying the truly needy should not have to suffer delays because of 
a few greedy opportunists.  
</P>
<P>
 He noted that because of the intense publicity focused on the deaths and 
rescue efforts at the Northridge Meadows, FEMA "red-flagged" applications filed 
by victims there for special review. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators collected information from a variety of sources, including mail 
carrier Michael Characky, who after the earthquake noticed that unfamiliar 
names were suddenly receiving mail, including FEMA material, at Northridge 
Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to my postmaster and told him things are not coming up kosher. I'm 
getting names of people I know don't live there," Characky said Friday. He said 
the supervisor took the information to FEMA. Agents interviewed relatives of 
victims, several tenants and the manager of Northridge Meadows as part of the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Lillis said investigators are scrutinizing additional applications related to 
Northridge Meadows, as well as several other buildings that received 
considerable publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the alleged scam outraged survivors of the Northridge Meadows 
collapse. "God, that makes me so angry," said Erik Pearson, 26. "We got some 
(aid) for rent, but right now we're in an empty apartment except for furniture 
from relatives and friends." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand (anyone) doing that," added former tenant Beverly Reading, 
who like Pearson has received $2,300 from FEMA so far. "It's just like people 
trying to go into our building to steal." 
</P>
<P>
 "It never occurred to me that someone could do something like that," said Hyun 
Lee, who lost her husband and son in the apartment where Cordero allegedly 
claimed to have suffered losses. "If he really needed it, I wish he could have 
used it. . . . If he was just trying to take advantage of my tragedy, then he 
needs to be punished."

A RUN FOR THE MONEY; BUSINESS: FROM ENERGY BARS TO SHOES TO NEW AGE MUSIC, 
MARKETERS AT THE QUALITY OF LIFE EXPO TAKE AIM AT THE THOUSANDS OF MARATHON 
RUNNERS.

 They will not be checking out the duck sausage pizza at Spago, the martinis at 
the Monkey Bar, the all-night party scene at Roxbury. 
</P>
<P>
 They have descended on Los Angeles bearing running shoes, discipline, and -- 
sometimes -- their own food. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bring what I need with me; I'm a vegetarian," says 39-year-old computer 
programmer Randy Caldwell, who's traveling with fig bars and high-carbohydrate 
energy snacks that are all the rage with athletes. And he has plenty of 
practice deflecting the temptations of sinful cities: He lives in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldwell and thousands of like-minded souls are not your typical 
weekend-in-L.A. tourists. They are among the 16,000 registered runners who will 
line up at the start of the ninth annual L.A. Marathon on Sunday. They come 
from every state, and from several foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thrill Caldwell and his fellow athletes seek is a smog-free Sunday to 
run 26.2 miles. That and a recommendation for a good Italian restaurant -- the 
food of choice is pasta. But Caldwell may get his carbohydrates at his aunt's 
house in Garden Grove. "She's prepared for me," he said with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 The runners' ascetic bent is not lost on the marketers cramming the north hall 
of the Convention Center. There, at an event billed as the Quality of Life 
Expo, runners could register for the marathon then traipse from booth to booth, 
poring over everything from shoes and T-shirts to safety food graters and New 
Age music cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, a vendor a block away was grilling up jumbo hot dogs wrapped in 
bacon, but that presented no temptations for this crowd. At the expo, runners 
could happily eat their way from Mrs. T's pierogies (1 gram of fat and 60 
calories each) through caramel rice cakes, low-fat cookies and virtually every 
energy bar on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a healthy party," said Les Martisko, who flew in from Minneapolis 
and planned to run the marathon with his wife, Linda, who lives in Newport 
Beach. (They have a commuter marriage.) 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody seemed to be feeling deprived. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you kidding? We're happy to be out of the snow," said Jane Laub, a record 
company accountant in Minneapolis who flew in with her husband, Mark, and 
Martisko, to run the marathon. They were all eating their way through the food 
venues of the convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Weather was a welcome diversion for others too. "I trained in the snow and I'm 
going to run in the sun," said Dianne Glasson of Lodi, N.J. "Yes, ma'am, I ran 
20 miles in a blizzard." 
</P>
<P>
 Runners are big on mental toughness. L.A. is easy to disdain. "It's an easy 
town not to party in -- it's too big and disgusting," said Robert Chestnut from 
Santa Cruz, who plans to run the marathon but on Friday afternoon was hawking 
Skinny Chips at a booth (the job was paying his way to the marathon.) 
</P>
<P>
 Others admitted to a bit of temptation. "It's hard for me to come early," said 
Glasson, who is staying with friends in Pasadena. "My friends are going out 
tonight and I'm staying home tonight. I'm going to bed by 8 p.m." 
</P>
<P>
 But as soon as she crosses that finish line, she expects her husband, Chris, 
and 4-year-old son, Patrick, to greet her appropriately. "As soon as I'm done," 
she said, "my husband will be waiting for me with my carbo-drink and a beer." 
</P>
<P>
 And even Caldwell, Mr. Vegetarian, admits he will capitulate to a post-race 
weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'll have lots of Mexican food -- with cheese and sour cream."

CITYSCAPES / DEAN E. MURPHY: THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE AIR, AND FOR A CHANGE, 
IT'S SWEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It has been striking mostly in the dark, like so many things these days, 
creeping surreptitiously through neighborhood streets, sneaking into bedrooms 
through open windows, even overpowering unsuspecting late-night commuters as 
they pull into their driveways. 
</P>
<P>
 And Los Angeles, for once, is breathing a deep sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blossoms are blooming, the sap is rising and people are going crazy," said 
Shirley Kerins, a curator at the Huntington Gardens in San Marino. "It has even 
infected non-plant people. Everyone has gone spacey." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to an unusually mild winter and a record-breaking heat wave, spring has 
sprung like rarely before in Los Angeles, packing the air with intoxicating 
scents of citrus, jasmine, daffodils and even oak. The injection of honey-sweet 
air has come weeks ahead of schedule and has turned life topsy-turvy in a 
fed-up city on the verge of reneging on its legendary love affair with Mother 
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just have to take a deep breath and you can't miss it," Patricia Torres, 
an attorney from Echo Park, said as she waited for a ride home this week at a 
busy Downtown intersection. "Living in a big city where there is so much 
traffic and stress, it is so nice to smell something sweet in the air." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The infusion of natural goodness into air best known for its toxicity has 
invited an entire region of locked doors and closed windows into the streets. 
Couch potatoes are stealing away from their sitcoms for an evening stroll, 
neighbors are smiling across back-yard fences and even motorists are cracking 
their windows ever so slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just makes you happy to be alive," said Lynette Goins of Hollywood, 
reading a romance novel on a balmy afternoon. "First thing in the morning when 
I step off the bus the trees smell wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 LuAnn Munns, who lives on a hillside in Glendora and commutes to work in South 
Gate, smells it best on the San Gabriel River Freeway in the very early 
morning. It is hard to tell what exactly is in the air -- she says it has an 
indescribable nippy scent -- but it is heavenly and enough to carry her through 
the day. When she gets home at night, she fixes upon the blossoms of her 
back-yard lime tree, planted years ago to supply her beloved margaritas. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the payoff time of the year," said Munns, a fierce gardener whose 
house is built around an atrium stuffed with plants. "I just blunder along and 
can't name what I am smelling, but just know it is wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is plenty of blissful bewilderment in the air. Spring fragrances, it 
seems, are a very personal thing, with just about everyone snorting a slightly 
different scent. One nose's orange blossom may be another's pittosporum 
undulatum (also known as mock orange) . Is that the aura of night-blooming 
jasmine, or a flush of angel trumpets? Osmanthus fragrans (sweet olive) or a 
tall bearded iris? 
</P>
<P>
 Clair Martin, a horticulturist who tends the roses at the Huntington, was a 
bit stymied when asked to isolate the fragrances in his own San Marino 
neighborhood. Martin grew up in Orange County and knows orange blossoms, and 
this smell is not the same, he said. The scent is strongest between 9 and 10 
p.m. when Martin walks his dog, and punctually disappears by daybreak. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin suspects sweet olive trees or perhaps a low-growing shrub with small 
white blossoms that is standard landscape fare in the affluent San Gabriel 
Valley suburb. Martin didn't dwell on the plant's proper name, choosing instead 
to rave about its evening aroma. 
</P>
<P>
 "It smells sweet, almost honey-like," he said, noting the only downside is 
that it exudes the stench of old socks during the daytime. "Most of us just say 
that it smells good and leave it at that." 
</P>
<P>
 The nocturnal mystery is less daunting to explain. Some blooming plants have 
such subtle scents that they are disturbed by the sun, Martin said. Plant 
fragrances are carried in alcohol or oil-based chemicals that evaporate quickly 
in the hot, dry daylight. Cooler evenings, with greater humidity, help plants 
disperse their olfactory glory to those in the animal kingdom -- most notably 
pollinating insects, but also many grateful humans. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Bauml, botanist for the Los Angeles County Arboretum, said the region's 
aromatic atmosphere should persist for four or five weeks before succumbing to 
the sting of smog and nature's inevitable segue into summer. Bauml advises 
enthusiastic sniffers to do a little research on their neighborhood greenery 
and make an adventure of this most pleasant time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you have to get up close and stick your nose right into the 
blossoms," Bauml advised. "Just make sure there aren't any bees in there."

SHIFT OF FUNDS FROM GARCETTI'S BUDGET URGED; INSURANCE: FIRMS SEEK TRANSFER OF 
$5 MILLION AFTER PROSECUTOR MOVES PERSONNEL OUT OF UNIT THAT HANDLES WORKERS' 
COMPENSATION FRAUD CASES. BUT ACTION WOULD REQUIRE A CHANGE IN STATE LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some insurers are calling for Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti's office to lose 
millions of dollars a year for the prosecution of workers' compensation fraud 
cases because of Garcetti's budget-induced reduction of deputies in his 
compensation fraud unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Those advocating the action have suggested that Garcetti's budget from the 
state-operated Fraud Assessment Fund, which totals $5 million this fiscal year, 
be given to the state attorney general's office so it can prosecute workers' 
compensation cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Such fraud is seen as a serious threat to California's economic health, 
causing the state to lose an estimated billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls for the money to be taken out of Garcetti's hands were made at a 
three-day meeting of insurers in San Diego that ended Friday, industry 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fraud Assessment Commission -- the state agency that administers a 
$25-million anti-fraud fund financed by insurance companies and self-insured 
employers -- has scheduled an emergency meeting next Friday in San Francisco to 
discuss Garcetti's actions. 
</P>
<P>
 A change in the law would be required to shift the money from the district 
attorney's office, but that could be accomplished through emergency 
legislation, industry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti has transferred five prosecutors -- a quarter of the compensation 
fraud unit -- to other jobs, and he has said he may shut down the unit this 
summer because of budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
 By law, Garcetti is required to return any unused portion of the money 
allocated annually from the Fraud Assessment Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Los Angeles County is the state's hotbed of workers' compensation 
fraud, there will be a ripple effect across California if Garcetti seriously 
weakens or closes the unit in his office, insurance and government officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, ongoing cases would be disrupted if Garcetti's files are 
transferred to the attorney general's office, said Marjorie Berte, insurance 
adviser to Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns about the unit were raised earlier this week after Garcetti announced 
that he will cut back or close special state and federally financed operations 
in his office because his staff has been devastated by attrition. There is a 
strict hiring freeze in his office and more prosecutors are needed to handle 
cases involving violent crime, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors imposed the hiring freeze, and Chief County 
Administrator Sally Reed has recommended it not be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the board knows we are putting at risk the money that the state gives 
us," Garcetti said Friday after one of his aides confirmed that the insurance 
industry is up in arms over his action. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti expressed hope that insurers would put pressure on supervisors to 
lift the hiring freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 "I very much want to continue to prosecute workers' compensation cases," 
Garcetti said, "but my first priority is violent crime." 
</P>
<P>
 District attorneys around the state are concerned about the loss of any money 
from the Fraud Assessment Fund because a formula is used to determine how much 
each agency gets, and their budgets could also be adversely affected if the pot 
is shrunk, said John Massucco, chief of the insurance fraud unit of the San 
Diego County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Massucco said the commission, as early as next week, could vote to begin 
shifting the money or to eliminate Garcetti's portion of the fund. But, he 
said, "It would be silly and totally counterproductive" to take either course 
of action. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford D. Sweet III, a San Diego-based lawyer who represents insurers in 
workers' compensation fraud cases, said many insurers, insurance reform 
advocates and industry lobbyists are incensed by Garcetti's reduction of 
compensation fraud prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is having a political reaction far greater than Garcetti ever dreamed of 
when he played his card," said Sweet, who helped create the Fraud Assessment 
Fund. "He thought the employers and self-insurers would rise to his aid and go 
to the Board of Supervisors to get more money for him." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Sweet said, insurers are not interested in getting involved in Garcetti's 
budget fight with supervisors: "They're not angry at the board. They couldn't 
care less."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; WITNESS 
DISPUTES GIRL'S STORY OF MOLESTATION ON PLANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 12-year-old girl who said she was groped by another passenger during a 
Southwest Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Las Vegas never cried out for 
help, a witness who sat across the aisle from her said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert E. Savitt, a Los Angeles County deputy district attorney, said he was 
keeping an eye on the youngster during the 45-minute flight last Sunday and saw 
no inappropriate behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Edward Gustafson, 48, of Hermosa Beach was arrested for investigation 
of three counts of open and gross lewdness with a child under 14 years of age 
after the plane landed and the girl reported the alleged incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl said Gustafson trapped her in an inside seat and touched her 
repeatedly during the flight. She said she called for help, but no one would 
help her. 
</P>
<P>
 Savitt said he was sitting directly across the aisle as Gustafson and a 
companion sat next to the girl. He said it is conceivable that the girl was 
touched while he was not looking, but he never heard her protest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope she wasn't molested, but if she was, she never yelled for help," said 
Savitt, who said he called Las Vegas prosecutors with his version of events.

ARTESIA MAN KILLED IN POLICE STANDOFF

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies shot and killed a gunman as he emerged from his home in 
Artesia after a two-hour standoff Friday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the man barricaded himself in his home in the 17600 block of 
Horst Avenue after firing three shots in a dispute with neighbors about 1 p.m., 
Sheriff's spokesman Sgt. Ron Spear said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies who surrounded the house saw Benjamin Sedano, 44, pointing weapons 
out the front window, Spear said. One was a high-powered hunting rifle with a 
scope. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3:25 p.m., Sedano emerged from the house carrying two .357-caliber 
magnum revolvers and a Glock 9 millimeter semiautomatic pistol, Spear said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He assumed a combative shooting stance and pointed one of the revolvers at 
the special weapons team members," Spear said. A special weapons team member 
shot him in the upper body.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN GABRIEL VALLEY; 
COMMODITIES FIRMS CLOSED IN ILLEGAL INVESTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials announced actions this week taken to shut down three commodities 
firms, including one in San Gabriel, which allegedly sold more than $10 million 
in illegal investments to primarily Asian American investors.  
</P>
<P>
 Lida International Financial Data of San Gabriel, Worth Financial Data of San 
Francisco, and their parent company, Topworth International of Hong Kong, are 
accused of the illegal sale of gold, silver and foreign currency. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Los Angeles news conference, California Commissioner of Corporations Gary 
Mendoza said most of the investors were from the Los Angeles and San Francisco 
areas.  
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza said his office and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission are 
taking both civil and criminal action against the firms.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a classic example of affinity group fraud," he said, "that is, when 
members of an ethnic or other minority group prey upon members of their own 
community."  
</P>
<P>
 "They use the strength of that community affiliation as a selling point, and 
encourage people to join their organizations and sell further investments to 
friends and family," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 In a joint filing in federal court, the Department of Corporations and CFTC 
brought action against the firms for alleged violations of the federal 
Commodity Exchange Act and the California Commodity Law of 1990, he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PICO-UNION; COUNCIL 
SEEKS TO SCRAP LOTTERY FOR HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Friday derailed a plan by the Community 
Redevelopment Agency to open up a housing development in the Pico-Union 
district to residents citywide after Councilman Mike Hernandez argued that 
those in the congested neighborhood ought to get first priority. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 32-unit Crescent Court Town Home project was proposed a decade ago, 
neighboring residents were told they would be at the top of the list to apply 
for the new units.But since then, the city adopted a policy that calls for a 
citywide lottery for such public housing developments to ensure diverse ethnic 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez argued that the city was backing out of a promise it made years ago 
to residents, mostly Latino. He said the population density in Pico-Union is 
147 people per acre, 10 times the city average. The council directed city 
officials to find a way to give nearby residents a first chance at the units 
without putting the city in legal jeopardy.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PACOIMA; SAFETY OF DAMS 
QUESTIONED IN EARTHQUAKE'S AFTERMATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pacoima Dam survived a pounding by the Northridge earthquake, but the huge 
ground motions recorded there Jan. 17 should cause dam builders and operators 
in seismic zones worldwide to re-examine the safety of their structures, a dam 
expert said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing in Burbank before the state Seismic Safety Commission, Caltech 
engineering professor John F. Hall said he believed the 365-foot-tall dam in 
the San Gabriel Mountains, which will require costly repairs, might not "have 
remained intact" if the quake had struck on one of the rare occasions when its 
reservoir was full. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vernon H. Persson, state dam safety chief, said he believed the massive 
impoundment would not "have failed even if full." 
</P>
<P>
 Although noting that area dams came through the quake without a single 
failure, commissioners and earthquake experts marveled at the enormous ground 
accelerations measured at Pacoima Dam, which reached a peak level of twice the 
force of gravity. 
</P>
<P>
 When "people around the world involved in dam engineering see the records, 
they're just going to be amazed," Hall said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the Northridge quake caused sideways and vertical shaking far 
stronger than would be expected in a 6.8 quake.

LEGAL FEES FOR DEFENDING MENENDEZ BROTHERS TOTAL $1.95 MILLION, PAPERS SHOW; 
COURTS: EXPENSES TO PARENTS' ESTATE INCLUDE $775,000 FOR ERIK'S ATTORNEYS AND 
$740,000 FOR LYLE'S LAWYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Legal fees for the defense of accused murderers Lyle and Erik Menendez are 
$1.95 million, according to court probate documents unsealed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 An accounting of their parents' estate as of April 30, 1993, shows $755,000 
was paid for Erik's defense.Leslie Abramson was his chief attorney. The estate 
spent $740,000 to defend Lyle, the bulk of that apparently going to Jill 
Lansing. He had two prior attorneys, Joel R. Isaacson and Gerald Chaleff. 
</P>
<P>
 The county also has filed to recoup the $453,015 cost of the brothers' second 
attorneys, bringing the total to $1.95 million for the first trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Irving Shimer opened sealed portions of the probate file 
over the objections of attorneys for the brothers, who face a second trial in 
the 1989 shotgun slayings of Jose and Kitty Menendez. The first trials ended in 
hung juries. 
</P>
<P>
 Lansing argued that the release of attorneys' fees would unduly prejudice the 
brothers' chances of a fair trial because the numbers would be shocking to 
potential jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense costs paid so far do not include money for investigation and 
expert witnesses paid by Los Angeles County. Such money is available from 
counties in death penalty cases. The figures are confidential, but as noted by 
the county attorneys in court documents, "could be substantial."

ISRAEL IS 'SAFE LIKE L.A.,' OFFICIAL SAYS; SETTLEMENTS: GOVERNMENT SPOKESMEN 
TRY TO REASSURE POTENTIAL IMMIGRANTS ABOUT TERRORISM IN THE MIDDLE EAST. 
</P>

<P>
 While visiting Israel last year, Beverlywood resident Robert Bain decided to 
move to Tel Aviv with his wife and four young sons this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent months, the ponytailed business investor has been flooded with a 
cascade of emotions about his decision: elation over the tentative peace accord 
with the Palestinians, and sorrow over acts of violence, including the massacre 
of 48 Palestinians in a Hebron mosque by an American Jewish settler. 
</P>
<P>
 So on Friday, given the opportunity to meet Ori Orr, chairman of the Knesset's 
committee on foreign affairs and defense, Bain asked about terrorism in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's safe like Los Angeles," answered Orr, a retired Israeli major general. 
</P>
<P>
 "More safe than Los Angeles," interrupted Mike Miller, head of the Israeli 
immigration office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Such answers were the order of the day as Orr, a member of the ruling Labor 
Party, met with reporters and several thirtysomething Los Angeles residents who 
plan to emigrate to Israel this year. The purpose of the visit was to persuade 
more Americans to move to Israel and to emphasize the positive contributions 
made by most American settlers, regardless of the acts of extremists such as 
Brooklyn, N.Y.-born Baruch Goldstein, a West Bank doctor who carried out the 
Hebron massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 "Israel is the best place to be for the quality of life and for Jewish 
community life," said Orr, who arrived in Los Angeles after a tour of a 
McDonnell Douglas factory in St. Louis that will soon begin production of 20 
F-15 fighter jets ordered by the Israeli government. "Ninety-five percent of 
the settlers are good people. We have problems with a small group." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last decade, about 2,000 Los Angeles-area residents have settled in 
Israel -- about a tenth of the total U.S. immigration to Israel during that 
period, Miller said. In comparison, Israel has taken in about 500,000 Jews from 
Russia and North Africa during the last four years, Orr said. 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage Western-style democracy in Israel, Orr said, increased 
immigration from the United States is critical, even if a handful turn out to 
be extremists. "I'd like to see a half-million Jews from the U.S. moving 
tomorrow. I can take the risk." 
</P>
<P>
 The prospective settlers, most in their mid-30s, one wearing a yarmulke, 
another a Boston Red Sox cap, greeted his message with enthusiasm.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're going before the mad rush once there's peace," said Bain, 37, who was 
born in Encino. "Maybe we can get an early start and establish ourselves 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Bain said he was concerned about such incidents as the recent terrorist attack 
on an elderly man in the suburb of Tel Aviv he plans to move to. Regardless, 
Bain said, he felt safe having his children playing outside during his visit to 
Israel last year. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not so on the Westside, he added, where his car was stolen from his 
driveway and his neighbor was held up in his own driveway in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it's not only the pull of Israel, but the push of Los Angeles. Los 
Angeles has been through tremendous changes in the past four or five years, 
especially the crime situation." Indeed, for most prospective settlers, myriad 
hassles of life in Los Angeles -- among them traffic, smog, crime, fires, 
floods and earthquakes -- make even the uncertainties of life in Israel seem 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Violence happens everywhere -- here too," said engineer Jeff Greenstein, 33, 
referring to the murder rate in Los Angeles and the attack in New York this 
week, allegedly by a Lebanese immigrant, on a van packed with Jewish students 
of the Lubavitcher sect. 
</P>
<P>
 "No place is safe," said Claremont native Carl Rosenblum, 28. "But in Israel, 
you have an opportunity to have an impact on a small but growing country."

AL MARTINEZ: BAMBI AND THE MEANIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I knew the battle against a proposed country club in Topanga Canyon was 
getting serious when a friend telephoned to say that if the project was 
approved, he would hurl himself from his balcony. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his balcony is only a foot off the ground, I feared for neither his life 
nor his general well-being, but realized by his call I had better take a look 
at the motivation behind what he calls his symbolic suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 The man doesn't scream and throw himself into the dirt for nothing. The reason 
this time is an abomination called Canyon Oaks Estates, a gated community of 97 
luxury homes and a private golf course planned for the upper end of Topanga 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 It is about as welcomed in the canyon as genital herpes, but the possibility 
exists that it could be approved next week by the Board of Supervisors, into 
whose swampy jurisdiction the project falls. 
</P>
<P>
 Since at least three of the five board members have accepted thousands of 
dollars in campaign contributions from the proposed builders, it bodes ill for 
those who favor trees over concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians will tell you that their decisions are based strictly on merit, 
but experience teaches that nothing sings of merit more sweetly than money. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign contributions come from the Walt Disney Co. and Sharon Disney 
Lund, the daughter of Walt Disney. They are the builders who, as one critic 
puts it, want to kill Bambi and build the 19th hole over his grave. 
</P>
<P>
 But I want to be at a safe distance if they try. This could get ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I live in the canyon and I know how tough its inhabitants can be. This is not 
a community of sloganeering suburbanites, but of people who march, write 
letters, go to court and jam board rooms in order to make their point. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget that old image of airy Topangans dancing naked in the moonlight to have 
their wishes granted. Some may still dance naked in the moonlight, but they are 
also knowledgeable environmentalists with law degrees who, fully clothed, will 
fight to the death for a tree frog. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been toughened by 16 years of battling two separate building 
consortiums who have wanted to bulldoze 257 acres of rolling hills and gentle 
slopes into a compound for the privileged. 
</P>
<P>
 The first builder was Christopher Wojciechowski, whom everyone called Wojo, 
after the amiable bewilderment of the character in the old "Barney Miller" 
television series. 
</P>
<P>
 He wanted to construct 224 homes, a hotel, condos, a heliport, a country club, 
a shopping center, a gas station, tennis courts and horse stables on the land. 
Everything but missile silos and an NFL stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 This, of course, did not make the people of Topanga happy, and they fought the 
development, then known as Montevideo, to a standstill. Wojo went bankrupt in 
1991, and the project was taken over by Sharon Disney Lund. 
</P>
<P>
 Lund died last year, after which the directors of her estate nonetheless went 
forward with plans for the project, proving that neither death nor financial 
ruin can stay the power of profit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Disney people hired public relations firms, renamed the development Canyon 
Oaks in order to evoke images of serenity and greenery, put out brochures 
condemning us Topangans as "elitists in environmental clothing" and opened 
their checkbooks for campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for the loving spirit of the Magic Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I've never seen a community fight so hard to keep what it calls "the forces of 
darkness" at bay. They know they're not dealing with Tinkerbell. 
</P>
<P>
 They attend public meetings by the busload, fill the Topanga newspaper with 
messages of condemnation, write hundreds of letters, gather petitions and hone 
each other to an incredible edge. 
</P>
<P>
 The most visible elements of their army are handmade signs along Topanga 
Canyon Boulevard that urge passersby to "Save Bambi." One sign says "Real Oaks 
not Canyon Oaks" and another "Flood, Fires, Quakes and Now Disney." 
</P>
<P>
 Some plead gently to leave Summit Valley, the site of the proposed 
development, intact. One is more abrupt: "Screw U Canyon Oaks." Another speaks 
in imagery: Mickey Mouse giving Disney the finger. 
</P>
<P>
 It is inevitable that individual homes will be built in the canyon, and some 
will be in the million-dollar class. Most Topangans, however grudgingly, accept 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 What they won't accept is the kind of massive development Disney plans for a 
sunlit valley created long before Donald Duck ever quacked his first quack. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a Topangan when it comes to that. Save the hillsides for our children and 
their children's children. They're one hell of a lot more important than a 
country club for the rich or profits for a company that claims to believe in 
the lofty welfare of the young.

DEPUTY PLEADS NOT GUILTY

 A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy charged with purchasing more than two 
pounds of cocaine during a sting operation planned to take the contraband to 
Tennessee and become a drug dealer, a prosecutor said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure was made in Los Angeles Municipal Court, where William Barr 
pleaded not guilty to felony drug charges stemming from Wednesday's undercover 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Barr, 25, of Bellflower, formally resigned Friday from the 
Sheriff's Department, where he had been a deputy for 4 1/2 years, most recently 
serving as a guard at the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho near Castaic, a 
department spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 During a short arraignment, Judge Barry Taylor set Barr's bail at $50,000 and 
scheduled a March 17 preliminary hearing.  
</P>
<P>
 Barr is being represented by a public defender, but no attorney has been 
assigned yet.  
</P>
<P>
 Undercover sheriff's deputies said they sold Barr a kilogram -- 2.2 pounds -- 
of cocaine Wednesday afternoon in the Terminal Annex Post Office parking lot in 
Downtown Los Angeles. Barr was arrested without incident immediately after the 
transaction, according to sheriff's officials, who added that two semiautomatic 
pistols were recovered from Barr's vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the sting operation came after a one-month investigation that 
started when an informant said Barr had inquired about purchasing a substantial 
quantity of drugs. Sheriff's Department officials would not comment Friday on 
the informant's identity.  
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his arrest, Barr was assigned to the North County Correctional 
Facility, a maximum-security jail at the Pitchess Honor Rancho, a sprawling 
facility where more than 10,000 inmates are housed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a criminal complaint filed Friday, Barr was charged with one count of 
possession of cocaine for sale and one count of selling cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Barr would face a maximum penalty of five years in state prison, 
according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Yochelson.  
</P>
<P>
 Citing his office's policy, Yochelson would not comment on whether Barr was 
being investigated in relation to any other drug deals.

CAT TRAPPED FOR 41 DAYS AFTER QUAKE DIES; PETS: VETERINARIAN IS UNABLE TO 
REVIVE TIFFANY, WHO CAPTURED WORLDWIDE ATTENTION AFTER SHE WAS FOUND IN A 
LOCKED CLOSET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Tiffany, the cat whose will to survive captured hearts as far as Europe, died 
early Friday, her body racked by the effects of malnutrition and dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-year-old Persian mix was found Sunday, her body withered after spending 
41 days in a storage closet where she had accidentally been locked in after 
fleeing the Jan. 17 earthquake. She had no food and only rainwater to drink. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that she had survived the ordeal -- something her veterinarians 
called unusual if not miraculous -- had made her an international symbol of 
hope. Calls from newspapers in London and Germany poured into the Animal Clinic 
of Santa Clarita, where she was being treated. CBS News was at the clinic 
preparing a live report when the cat went into cardiac and respiratory arrest 
early Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany's veterinarian, Sandy Sanford, spent 20 minutes trying to save her 
with cardiopulmonary resuscitation, oxygen and drug therapy. But the cat, who 
had lost about 60% of her body weight, did not respond. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the back of my mind, I knew this was a potential complication," Sanford 
said. "But I was hoping, since she'd gone this long, I was hoping she would 
make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany's owner, Laurie Booth, on her way to meet CBS, arrived at the 
veterinary clinic minutes after Sanford stopped trying to revive the cat at 
4:21 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Booth wondered how the cat could have been so close -- in a neighbor's storage 
closet -- and not have been found. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was right there all the time, probably praying I would open the door, and 
I was praying I would find her," Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Booth was still thankful that she had found Tiffany alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't die alone in a cold place. She knew she was loved," Booth said. 
"She definitely was a little fighter."

TV IGNORES RELIGION, STUDY SHOWS; MEDIA: WATCHDOG GROUP CLAIMS THAT AMONG 
18,000 STORIES ON EVENING NEWS SHOWS, ONLY 212 INVOLVED THEOLOGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Religious News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A study by a conservative media watchdog group concludes that the nation's 
major television networks virtually ignore religious news. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, by the Media Research Center of Alexandria, Va., found that of more 
than 18,000 stories on network evening news shows in 1993, only 212 were 
religion stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Religion fared even worse on morning news shows, with 197 of more than 23,000 
stories, and on burgeoning magazine shows such as "20/20," "Prime Time Live" 
and "48 Hours," which aired 18 segments on religion in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "An overwhelming majority of Americans believe in God and attend church or 
synagogue at least twice a month," L. Brent Bozell, III, chairman of the Media 
Research Center, told a news conference Wednesday in releasing the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "But religious issues are hardly ever mentioned, much less covered on network 
television morning, evening and magazine shows," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We never see the good things religious groups are doing, whether it's helping 
the homeless, the abused, or homosexuals suffering from AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead, both religion and religious leaders are portrayed as cold, 
intolerant and oppressive," Bozell said. "Worse yet, their enemies are given 
immediate credibility through media exposure, no matter how lacking the basis 
for their charges." 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the news conference were Ralph Reed, executive director of the 
political activist Christian Coalition, founded by evangelical television 
broadcaster Pat Robertson, and Thomas Wykes, executive director of the Catholic 
Campaign for America. 
</P>
<P>
 For the evening news programs, the study looked at ABC's "World News Tonight," 
"CBS Evening News," CNN's "World News," NBC's "Nightly News" and "The 
MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour" on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Those shows aired only 212 religion stories during 1993, the study says. Of 
those, 134 were reporter-narrated and the other 78 were brief stories, such as 
wire services provide, read by news anchors.  
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-three of the 212, or 25%, came during Pope John Paul II's visit to the 
United States in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The report says Roman Catholicism was the subject of an overwhelming majority 
of the nightly news stories -- 79 of the 134 reporter-assembled segments, and 
47 of the 78 stories read by anchors. 
</P>
<P>
 In second place were general references to religion, including segments on 
Supreme Court church-state cases and the religious right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stories on specific Protestant denominations were rare," the study said. "In 
fact, Islam, with four reporter-based stories and one anchor brief, gained more 
coverage than Jews (3), the Greek Orthodox church (2), Lutherans (1), Baptists 
(1), Presbyterians (1) and Unitarians (1)." 
</P>
<P>
 The study did not include the Branch Davidian siege in Waco, Tex., or the 
World Trade Center bombing, except for the stories dealing specifically with 
the religion or theology involved, Bozell said. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC, which recently became the first network to hire a full-time religion 
reporter, had the highest per-hour average of religion coverage and did more 
than twice as many stories (22) as any of the other networks. NBC was second, 
and CBS covered the fewest religion stories of the three biggest networks, with 
31. 
</P>
<P>
 Bozell was especially critical of the fact that of the religion stories 
covered, 25 related to the allegations of sexual abuse in a lawsuit filed -- 
but recently dropped -- against Chicago's Cardinal Joseph Bernardin. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also criticizes network coverage of the volatile social issues of 
abortion and homosexuality, saying the networks focused heavily on what the 
report terms "the abortion rights agenda" and the "gay agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 The study recommends that the networks begin hiring religion reporters, 
especially religious people, to cover religion news and that it end the "good 
news is no news" mentality that "ignores the positive role of churches in 
America today."

POLL OF MINORITIES FINDS BIAS, ANGER TOWARD WHITES; SURVEY: NATIONAL CONFERENCE 
UNCOVERS 'A YAWNING GULF' IN PERCEPTIONS OF EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Minority groups have widespread prejudices toward one another while sharing 
animosity toward whites, a poll by a major ecumenical group has found. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll found "a yawning gulf between white and minority group perceptions 
about America," said the group founded in 1927 as the National Conference of 
Christians and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight in 10 blacks in the poll released Wednesday believe that their race 
lacks the opportunities enjoyed by whites. Six in 10 Latinos and nearly as many 
Asian Americans feel the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Each minority group feels the others have been discriminated against, too, 
while most whites say minorities have equal opportunities, the poll found. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a loud and strong and clear message to white America that you think 
things are better than your neighbors do," said Karl Berolzheimer of the 
National Conference, as the group now calls itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Harris, whose LH Research conducted the survey, is known for producing 
provocative results. In this poll, he did so by including ugly generalizations 
about minorities, which sizable numbers of Americans agreed with. 
</P>
<P>
 Some findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * More than four in 10 blacks and Latinos and 27% of whites concur with the 
stereotype that Asian Americans are "unscrupulous, crafty and devious in 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 * Nearly half the Latinos and four in 10 blacks and whites agree with the 
statement that Muslims "belong to a religion that condones or supports 
terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
 * Two in three minority group members agreed with assertions that white people 
are insensitive to other people, have a long history of bigotry and believe 
they can boss other people around. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanford Cloud Jr., named Wednesday as National Conference president, said the 
poll showed him that "there's a lot of work that needs to be done within 
communities of color regarding their feelings toward each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Cloud, the first black leader of the organization, said he was surprised such 
a large gap remained between white and minority views. He attributed it in part 
to people isolating themselves in their homes and being exposed to insensitive 
media portrayals of minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as we continue to have such differences of opinion we cannot possibly 
come together and reach our full potential as a nation," he said. Discussing 
the intolerance exposed by the poll is necessary so the country can unite 
against problems like homelessness and street violence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 LH Research said it polled nearly 2,755 people by phone. The Ford and Joyce 
foundations co-sponsored the study. 
</P>
<P>
 The interviewers told those polled they would read "some statements reflecting 
common attitudes." They rotated alternated generalizations, such as Jews "are 
more loyal to Israel than to America," with positive attributes, such as Jews 
"place a high value on education and achievement." 
</P>
<P>
 Respondents only were asked about other groups, not their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Large majorities of those polled agreed with some of the positive statements, 
and an overwhelming number rejected the stereotype that blacks have less native 
intelligence. That view was held by 12%, down from 25% in a 1978 Harris survey.

 At the end of the poll, respondents were asked if they were willing to work 
with groups very different from themselves for various good causes such as "to 
protect each other's children from gangs and violence." About nine in 10 in 
virtually every group said they would be willing. The poll also elicited 
endorsements for teaching cultural diversity.

POPE CREATES DIOCESE FOR MARONITES IN WESTERN U.S.; CATHOLICISM: THE 
JURISDICTION, CALLED AN EPARCHY, WILL BE HEADED BY BISHOP JOHN G. CHEDID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pope John Paul II has created a diocese headquartered in Los Angeles for 
Catholics of the Maronite rite in the western United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maronites are one of 18 Eastern rite Catholic churches in communion with 
Rome.The group's communicants are primarily Lebanese immigrants and Lebanese 
Americans. There are an estimated 15,000 Maronite Catholics in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The new diocese, or eparchy, will be headed by Bishop John G. Chedid, who has 
lived in Los Angeles since 1956 and has served as pastor of Our Lady of Mt. 
Lebanon-St.Peter Church in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Until his appointment as a diocesan bishop here, Chedid, 69, had also served 
as an auxiliary bishop for the nationwide Eparchy of St. Maron, headquartered 
in Brooklyn, N.Y. The western diocese was carved out of the national eparchy. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Chedid said Rome first began speaking of a separate western 
diocese about five years ago. "To tell you the truth," Chedid said with a 
laugh, "I was opposed to it. But I could not oppose it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he expects the creation of the regional diocese to give Maronite 
Catholics in the western United States more contact with their bishop and 
called it "the most wise decision that the Holy See has done." 
</P>
<P>
 "I do hope and pray that the bishop being among his people and the different 
programs you would have will be beneficial to the people," Chedid said. "That's 
the goal of the whole thing -- to serve the people in a more efficient way." 
</P>
<P>
 Chedid's enthronement as bishop is tentatively scheduled for June 25.

CHILDHOOD IMAGE OF GOD PREVAILS AMONG ADULTS, AUTHORS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When asked his identity, God answered cryptically in Scripture, "I Am Who I 
Am." Religious thinkers say God is beyond human definitions or comprehension, 
but that many people tend to shrink him down to handy, manageable size. 
</P>
<P>
 Such notions generally are carried over from Sunday school images from 
childhood, never subjected to mature examination, says Rabbi Jack Bemporad, a 
leader in Jewish-Christian dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many ways, we have grown smarter, but when it comes to God, many of us 
haven't grown at all," Bemporad and advertising executive Michael Shevack 
write, saying that many haven't developed views matching adult knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have stupid ways of thinking about God," they say. "The ideas we 
were spoon-fed as children we now gag on as adults," undermining and destroying 
belief in many cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In an often humorous but perceptive book, "Stupid Ways, Smart Ways, to Think 
about God," published by Triumph Books, the authors describe both the 
frequently silly but also sensible views of God. 
</P>
<P>
 To a large extent, atheists seldom reject a credible God but usually "reject 
some stupid way of thinking about God," the authors say, calling some ideas 
about God "so ridiculous they are not worth believing." 
</P>
<P>
 Although God can't be reduced to human analysis, the authors say there are 
"smart ways to think of God" that expand and change with time and that "also 
expand and change us."  
</P>
<P>
 Bemporad, of Englewood, N.J., is director of the Center for Jewish-Christian 
Understanding at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Conn. Shevack, of Bucks 
County, Pa., has written numerous articles on religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the "stupid" views of God listed in their 117-page book: 
</P>
<P>
 * God as your personal "cosmic bellhop," ratifying "your every desire," always 
"ready to serve you" to control others, making in essence "yourself god." 
</P>
<P>
 * God as "little Mary Sunshine," so don't worry, "little Mary Sunshine will 
take care of everything for you." 
</P>
<P>
 * The "proverbial God of wrath, ready to show how much he cares by punishing 
you, the Marquis de God," despising sinners so much he exterminates them. 
Adherents of this view blame God's vindictiveness, rather than "our own moral 
lapses." 
</P>
<P>
 * "God the general," a "nationalistic god" whose "holy mission is to serve his 
country. Protect its honor." He's not just defender, but a "self-righteous and 
meddlesome god. . . . He is the commander of crusades. The leader of jihads."  
</P>
<P>
 * "God the master of ceremonies," who leads weddings, bar mitzvahs, 
confirmations, christenings, circumcisions, funerals, to be hired by anyone.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the smart ways to think of God, the book says: 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider God "the beginning of the beginning" of everything, before the big 
bang, before the time-space continuum, before energy and matter, before any 
universe. * Recognize "God is living" in the present. This doesn't mean he 
breathes air and digests foods but that God's infinity "permeates everything," 
a "strange quality called consciousness."  
</P>
<P>
 * As "the creator," God must have "one heck of an IQ" -- the "ultimate 
prodigy." You can see this supreme intelligence at work "if we look at 
creation."  
</P>
<P>
 * He gave humanity "truly godlike" qualities, his free will to share in 
shaping creation, the source both of humanity's suffering and dignity, to make 
choices. God "can't just swoop down and make our lives perfect. That would be 
an insult against our humanity, our nature. It would violate the very free 
spirit he gave us. . . . He must allow man rope, even if he hangs himself." 
</P>
<P>
 * "God is personal" and he has "real consequences for your life" and "must 
become the standard by which you evaluate your decisions."  
</P>
<P>
 * God is forever, confronting the "power of death." God lifts the 
"executioner's mask" and "says we are immortal" because we were created in his 
immortal spirit. That is our true nature. "God says our consciousness lives 
on."

STATE OF THE ART CO-FOUNDER SUES FIRM; COURTS: CHARLES G. MILDEN ALLEGES IRVINE 
SOFTWARE COMPANY DEFRAUDED HIM AND THEN COVERED IT UP WITH LEGAL ACTIONS, 
RESULTING IN BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS AND FINANCIAL SETBACKS FOR HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The co-founder of the Orange County software firm that contends it developed 
the popular Quicken personal finance program has filed a racketeering and fraud 
suit against the company and numerous individuals, including several attorneys 
who were involved in his recent bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit, filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Charles G. 
Milden accuses State of the Art Inc. in Irvine -- the company he founded in 
1981 -- of defrauding him in a stock repurchase deal after he was fired as 
company president in 1985. The suit alleges a series of events aimed at 
covering up the purported fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * A $6-million suit against Milden by State of the Art that forced him into 
bankruptcy in 1992. Among those named as defendants in the suit are State of 
the Art's current president, David W. Hanna, and its chief of research and 
development, George Riviere. Riviere was the best man at Milden's wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 * A conspiracy by the company and a private investigator that resulted in 
Milden's Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization being converted to a Chapter 7 
liquidation action that placed his assets under the control of a 
court-appointed trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 * An unexplained decision by the first trustee to settle Milden's countersuit 
against State of the Art for $125,000 when he and his personal attorneys 
believed he could win $1 million or more if the case had gone to court. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ongoing efforts by several trustees and bankruptcy attorneys to keep Milden 
in Chapter 7 instead of allowing him to participate in a reorganization plan 
that would allow him to regain control of his assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The bankruptcy trustees and attorneys named as defendants in the suit are 
included in both the racketeering and conspiracy sections; their actions to 
place Milden in Chapter 7 and to keep him there allegedly are part of the 
larger scheme to keep him from pressing his claims against the company, 
according to James H. Fosbinder, Milden's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Milden, a software development engineer, teamed up with Riviere to form State 
of the Art to develop accounting software. One of their early efforts, which 
the company sold to Intuit in Palo Alto in 1987, became the basis for the 
Quicken personal finance management program. Intuit acknowledges State of the 
Art's early efforts but disputes the company's contention that it was the 
actual developer of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Intuit has since sold almost 4 million copies of the Quicken program, making 
it the most popular software of its type in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Milden, who became a millionaire in 1979 when he and Riviere sold their first 
software company to MAI Systems Inc. of Tustin, wound up in bankruptcy court in 
1992 because of the costs of defending himself against a suit brought by State 
of the Art in 1990. That suit, alleging that Milden had stolen company trade 
secrets, was filed almost five years after he was fired as company president in 
a dispute with investors and directors over management style. 
</P>
<P>
 Milden's financial downfall began in 1990, when he sold 90,300 shares of State 
of the Art stock to the company under a repurchase agreement. The company 
valued the shares at 80 cents each and paid Milden $72,200. Within several 
months, Milden said in the suit he filed in 1991, the company offered its 
shares in a public sale and priced them at $9 each. 
</P>
<P>
 State of the Art filed its suit against Milden after he complained that he had 
been defrauded in the stock repurchase, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Milden said he filed his suit in retaliation and that the cost of defending 
himself against the State of the Art suit while pressing his own case forced 
him to file a Chapter 11 petition in bankruptcy court, seeking protection from 
creditors' claims while he reorganized his finances. 
</P>
<P>
 But Milden's Chapter 11 case, which allowed him to maintain control of his 
finances and spending, was transformed into a Chapter 7 case when he failed to 
persuade the bankruptcy trustee reviewing his case that he had filed an 
adequate plan of reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 A Chapter 7 action gives control of Milden's personal estate to a trustee and 
the first trustee to get the case worked out a settlement with State of the Art 
in which the company agreed to pay $125,000 to the Milden estate after Milden 
was done appealing various decisions that have gone against him in recent 
years.

DID NOTHING QUESTIONABLE, SPARTA INSISTS; INVESTIGATION: THE LAGUNA HILLS 
DEFENSE CONTRACTOR DEFENDS ITS BILLING PRACTICES AS CONSISTENT WITH GOVERNMENT 
POLICY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County defense contractor Sparta Inc. Friday defended its practice of 
seeking government reimbursement for sending key employees to yearly company 
meetings in resorts, saying its actions were consistent with government policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparta, an engineering services company, said in a press release that the only 
reason the costs were questioned during congressional hearings earlier this 
week was that the meetings were in places such as Mexico, Hawaii and the 
Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, has 
criticized Sparta and five other companies, saying they billed the government 
for questionable overhead costs. The GAO also blames Pentagon contract officers 
for permitting such costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparta said the Pentagon and GAO do not question its need for annual 
gatherings of key employees "to review operating policy and technology 
progress." The issue, Sparta said, is the extra cost of having the meetings at 
resorts. Sparta contends such sites add only $200 per employee -- a figure the 
company said it considers "incentive compensation." The Laguna Hills company 
said it is "dismayed by the suggestion of improper overhead charges" billed to 
the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparta's statement says the company had consulted with the Pentagon before at 
least one of such meetings and had reached agreement on the terms for being 
reimbursed. 
</P>
<P>
 After the GAO raised concerns about trips conducted in 1988 and 1989, Sparta 
said, the company immediately refunded $17,000 to the government for costs 
"questioned by the GAO to be expressly unallowable." 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO released the report this week. It criticizes six small defense 
contractors, Sparta and SRS Technologies in Newport Beach among them, alleging 
that they billed the government for millions of dollars to cover trips to 
exotic resorts, for excessive company car expenses, for alcohol and for 
unexplained consultant costs. 
</P>
<P>
 A GAO analyst testified before the Senate Budget Committee Thursday and 
released a confidential 1992 GAO report that criticized the firms, saying they 
submitted questionable overhead bills to the Pentagon. Members of the committee 
expressed outrage at the allegations of abuse of taxpayer money. 
</P>
<P>
 GAO analyst David Cooper told the committee Thursday that Sparta continued to 
bill the government for such expenses, including $229,000 for travel to Hawaii, 
after being notified of the GAO investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, Sparta's practices are quite different," the company says in its 
statement.  
</P>
<P>
 Sparta, which did not attend the hearing to defend itself, said its meeting 
costs had been fully disclosed to Pentagon contracting officers and that those 
officers largely approved them as legitimate overhead expenses to be paid by 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the GAO report does not publicly break down specific questionable 
expenses company by company, congressional sources identified those incurred by 
the Orange County firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparta allegedly billed the government for employee trips to annual 
stockholders and management meetings. The bills included $333,000 for trips to 
Grand Cayman Island, Jamaica, Hawaii and Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, the sources 
said. Other bills considered "unallowable" were $133,200 in meals for spouses 
of employees, personal use of company cars, alcoholic beverages and 
inadequately documented consultant fees. 
</P>
<P>
 After the company learned of the GAO investigation results in late 1992, 
Sparta said, it met with a Pentagon contract officer to address expenses for 
its 1993 annual meeting scheduled later in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our charges for that meeting will be strictly in accordance with terms 
approved by the government," the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Sparta declined Friday afternoon to answer questions about the 
written release. Officials at SRS Technologies did not return calls for 
comment.

THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY; FHP WILL ACQUIRE RIVAL TAKECARE IN HMO INDUSTRY'S 
LARGEST MERGER; TAKEOVERS: THE $1.1-BILLION DEAL WOULD CREATE ANOTHER MAJOR 
PLAYER IN CALIFORNIA MANAGED CARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ and DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FHP International Corp. agreed Friday to acquire a competing Northern 
California health maintenance organization in a deal that would create a giant 
statewide HMO that could provide more convenient service for large California 
employers and workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger, the largest ever in a burgeoning managed care industry that has 
seen a slew of consolidations, calls for Fountain Valley-based FHP to acquire 
Concord-based TakeCare Inc. in a sweetened cash and stock deal valued at nearly 
$1.1 billion. FHP's earlier $829-million offer in January had been spurned by 
TakeCare, triggering a bidding war. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the merger would add to the already considerable power that HMOs 
have in the California health care market. 
</P>
<P>
 The new company, which would be the nation's fifth-largest HMO, could prove 
especially attractive to large employers with workers throughout the state. 
Many companies prefer to deal with one organization that can offer them 
"one-stop shopping" for medical care, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes them a legitimate statewide player in all major California markets," 
said Peter Boland, a health care consultant in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 As such, it would compete strongly with Kaiser Permanente, Blue Cross and 
Health Systems International, the managed care company formed by the recent 
merger of Pueblo, Colo.-based QualMed Inc. and the parent firm of Health Net, 
based in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sends a pretty clear message that (managed care companies) will have to 
have statewide reach, or if you're not statewide, you will need dominant market 
share in a particular market," Boland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward J. Susank, principal at William M. Mercer, a health care consulting 
firm, said the deal would add to the pressure on California physicians and 
hospitals to cut the prices they charge HMOs for their services. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal gives FHP-TakeCare "a tremendous amount of marketing clout to 
negotiate (lower) prices" with physicians and hospitals, Susank said. 
</P>
<P>
 If those physicians and hospitals refuse to cut prices, they face the risk of 
being dumped by the HMO and thus losing thousands of patients, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear, however, whether FHP-TakeCare would pass along any lower 
costs to consumers in the form of lower premiums. For-profit, publicly held 
HMOs such as FHP and TakeCare have faced pressure from investors to increase 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 HMO mergers can also reduce the choice among health plans available to 
employers and workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitals and physicians, who often complain about the growing influence of 
managed care companies over patient care, are already forming their own large 
groups to counter moves by HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the future of some smaller HMOs could be threatened by the emergence of 
very powerful competitors such as FHP-TakeCare. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger would double FHP's membership to 1.6 million in eight states and 
the U.S. territory of Guam, creating a company with combined $3.25 billion in 
annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going to be a wonderful combination," said Wescott (Bill) Price III, 
FHP's chief executive. "Of all the mergers I've seen (in the HMO industry), 
I've never seen one that makes more sense." 
</P>
<P>
 There were no immediate plans to drop TakeCare's name or issue layoff notices 
as the two firms combine operations, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the definitive agreement, FHP agreed to pay $80 a share -- up from its 
original offer of $62.50 a share made Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The boards of both companies held numerous meetings over the past several days 
to work out final details before reaching an accord Thursday night, company 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, which requires regulatory approval, is expected to be completed in 
July. Neither side expects any challenges to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Though about $270 million higher than FHP's initial offer, the structure of 
the deal is the same: TakeCare shareholders would receive 50% in FHP preferred 
stock, 35% in cash and 15% in FHP common stock, with the FHP common retaining a 
constant value of $28 per share. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $385 million to be paid in cash, about $288 million would be raised 
through a bank loan from Chemical Bank of New York, Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial analysts said the debt load would not hurt the company in the long 
run. And Standard & Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors Services said they are 
maintaining their credit ratings for FHP, despite the deal's expected drag on 
future earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Completion of the merger . . . will strengthen FHP's position as a health 
maintenance organization without overly extending its capital structure," S&P 
said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 But some health care analysts said that in the short run, FHP would suffer 
financially partly because of the steep price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary O'Connell, analyst with San Francisco brokerage of Louis Nicoud 
Associates, said the price is at "the high end" of what she thought TakeCare 
might fetch. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement of the deal sent TakeCare's stock soaring. It closed at 
$75.25 a share on the Nasdaq market, up $7.875 a share. FHP stock, also traded 
on Nasdaq, fell $1.75 a share to close at $26.75 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 TakeCare President R. Judd Jessup confirmed Friday that "several other 
companies" had made offers to purchase TakeCare after the initial FHP bid, 
which was rejected after several TakeCare shareholders filed suit challenging 
the offer. Most of those subsequent offers were unsolicited, Jessup said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the bidders was FHP's chief competitor, PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. 
of Cypress. PacifiCare officials declined to comment on Friday's announcement. 
Merger General 
</P>
<P>
 FHP International Corp. agreed o buy TakeCare Inc. for about $1.1 billion in 
cash and FHP stock. The move is another sign of continuing consolidation in the 
health care industry and the growing role of health maintenance organizations. 
CREATING A GIANT

JAPAN'S TRADE SURPLUS WITH U.S. SURGES BY AN UNEXPECTED 30.9% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY and SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hopes for easing U.S.-Japan tensions suffered another blow Friday with the 
release of statistics showing an unexpected surge in Japan's trade surplus with 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The report of a 30.9% surge in the current-account surplus for January came as 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa insisted that Japan can reduce its massive 
trade surpluses over the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
 In a policy speech to Parliament on Friday, Hosokawa repeated a promise made 
by his predecessor to President Clinton last July, declaring that "we must . . 
. take effective measures to achieve a highly significant decrease in our 
current-accounts surplus over the medium term." 
</P>
<P>
 The current account -- which measures total trade plus such non-trade 
transactions as insurance, shipping and tourism -- jumped to $6.83 billion in 
January, compared to $5.22 billion in the year-ago period, the Finance Ministry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The surplus started falling last year, leading some observers to believe a 
turnaround had begun. That optimistic scenario now seems to have collapsed. 
During his wide-ranging address to Parliament, Hosokawa made no specific 
reference to the Clinton Administration's action on Thursday reinstituting the 
Super 301 provision of U.S. trade law, which allows Washington to retaliate 
against Japanese imports if Japan fails to open its market to U.S. goods. But 
many of his remarks were clearly aimed at addressing concerns of the United 
States, which ran a $59.3-billion trade deficit with Japan last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Along with managing the economy so that domestic demand leads growth, we need 
to ensure that the Japanese market is open to the rest of the world in 
accordance with international trade rules," Hosokawa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa also pledged to carry out economic and administrative reform -- 
strongly urged by the United States -- by "demolishing systems and practices no 
longer compatible with the needs of the times." He vowed to make 
"non-regulation the norm and regulation the exception . . . to expand business 
opportunities and consumer choice." 
</P>
<P>
 He singled out "information telecommunications" as one area in which 
government regulation should be removed to promote business opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Economic structures that used to work rationally are no longer effective," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The apparent willingness of Hosokawa's government to carry out at least some 
domestic reforms favored by Washington has helped prevent concerns about a 
possible trade war from having too severe an impact on Tokyo stock and currency 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The yen generally has been strengthening as currency traders bet that 
Washington will favor a stronger yen, which makes Japanese exports more 
expensive in dollar terms and thus harder to sell. A strong yen in turn 
threatens prospects for economic recovery in Japan and thus has a depressing 
effect on stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dollar rebounded Friday, boosted by buying by the Bank of Japan, to 
close at 104.80 yen, up 0.88, or 0.8% over Thursday's close. Encouraged by the 
weaker yen, stock investors sent the benchmark Nikkei average of 225 stocks up 
360.14 points, or 1.8%, to close at 19,966.00. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington has also been pressing Tokyo for more expansionary fiscal policy to 
promote economic recovery and greater consumer spending, which could draw in 
more imports and help reduce the trade imbalance.

THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY; NME CLOSE TO SELLING MOST OF PSYCHIATRIC UNIT; 
DIVESTITURES: SANTA MONICA COMPANY SAYS IT IS IN 'SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS' WITH 
CHARTER MEDICAL FOR 51 HOSPITALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 National Medical Enterprises Inc., which has been plagued by charges of fraud, 
patient mistreatment and other abuses at its psychiatric hospitals, appears 
close to divesting most of that business. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica-based NME said Friday that it is in "serious negotiations" to 
sell 51 of its psychiatric facilities to Charter Medical Corp., the nation's 
largest private operator of psychiatric hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Charter, based in Macon, Ga., said it is reviewing operations at most of NME's 
61 psychiatric facilities but that no definitive sales agreement has been 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
 NME's sale of the psychiatric division has been expected. 
</P>
<P>
 If the deal goes through, NME will rid itself of an operation that has been 
the subject of hundreds of costly lawsuits from insurers, patients and 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 NME's psychiatric division is still the target of a Justice Department 
criminal investigation, disclosed by authorities last August, into alleged 
billing fraud and other irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm has said previously that it wants to focus on its core business of 
general acute care hospitals, which generated about 65% of NME's $2.35 billion 
in sales last year. NME recorded a $287.4-million loss for its second quarter 
ended Nov. 30 to cover the cost of divesting its psychiatric unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Christi R. Sulzbach, NME's senior vice president, said the companies decided 
to disclose the negotiations because "there were rumors out there . . . and we 
didn't think there would be much chance of keeping this confidential." 
</P>
<P>
 The sale of most of the psychiatric business would be "an important step 
forward in the company's future evolution," Sulzbach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street seemed to welcome the news. NME stock was up 87.5 cents to $16.375 
on the New York Stock Exchange, while Charter rose $1.50 to $24 on the American 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 For Charter, the acquisition would be in line with a company strategy just the 
opposite of NME's. The Georgia firm wants to tighten its focus on the mental 
health business and last year sold 10 of its general hospitals to Quorum Health 
Group for $340 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal would increase by about two-thirds Charter's already dominant 
presence in the psychiatric business. It now operates 75 psychiatric hospitals 
in the United States, England and Switzerland. Charter has also been trying to 
broaden its range of psychiatric services by purchasing physician groups 
comprising psychiatrists, outpatient treatment centers and long-term care 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an awful lot of consolidation going on in the acute care side of the 
business, and you're seeing the same thing in mental health," said E. Mac 
Crawford, Charter's chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not to say bigger is better in health care . . . but you have to have 
a local network that has strong information systems to reduce your overhead and 
generate efficiencies," Crawford said. By establishing a network of services, 
Charter could take its plan to insurance companies and employers and contract 
with them to provide a whole range of mental health services for a lump sum. 
</P>
<P>
 Buying NME's hospitals would also move the company into the Northeast and 
Mid-Atlantic markets and into some California cities where it has no 
operations. Charter currently operates 10 hospitals in California. 
</P>
<P>
 NME officials would not discuss a possible sale price, but the firm's Nov. 30 
financial statement lists the value of the psychiatric unit's assets at about 
$254 million. NME officials said the legal troubles in the division have 
reduced its market value.

MICHIGAN CITES STAR SALESMAN AT PRUDENTIAL; INSURANCE: REGULATORS MOVE TO 
REVOKE THE LICENSE OF ANTHONY J. AMARADIO. HE HAS DENIED VIOLATING RULES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michigan regulators have moved to revoke the license of a leading Prudential 
Insurance salesman who divides his time between Newport Beach and Michigan and 
who was hired by Prudential despite a track record of problems in a prior job. 
</P>
<P>
 The action comes just days after Prudential Insurance Chairman Robert Winters 
publicly defended the decision to hire Anthony J. Amaradio in 1991 despite a 
lengthy record of customer complaints, disciplinary action by regulators and 
pending investigations. Winters said Prudential has no plans to sever its ties 
to Amaradio. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, a Prudential Insurance spokesman said the company had not been 
notified of the Michigan charges and therefore would not have any comment. 
Neither Amaradio nor his lawyer, Laurence S. Schultz, responded to messages 
seeking comment. In interviews late last year, they strongly denied that 
Amaradio had violated any rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential has been under fire for months because of an $8-billion limited 
partnership debacle at its Wall Street subsidiary, Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Amaradio, the Michigan Insurance Bureau alleges in a long list 
of civil charges dated Feb. 28 -- and obtained by The Times on Friday -- that 
he deserves to lose his license because "he is not honest and trustworthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Amaradio is accused of violating state insurance laws by forging customers' 
initials on insurance forms, using high-pressure sales tactics and misleading 
many Michigan customers in the 1980s while he was a salesman for the Equitable 
Assurance Society. 
</P>
<P>
 If the charges are upheld and Michigan suspends Amaradio's license, it could 
lead to his suspension in California as well, California regulators have said. 
Amaradio also faces potential fines under the Michigan charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Amaradio was fired by Equitable, which in November was fined $1.5 million by 
the National Assn. of Securities Dealers, in part for allegedly having failed 
to supervise Amaradio. Equitable settled the charges without admitting or 
denying wrongdoing. Amaradio was hired almost immediately by Prudential. He has 
denied that he was fired, although documents filed with the NASD and copies of 
Equitable correspondence obtained by The Times state that he was. 
</P>
<P>
 Amaradio is facing NASD charges for alleged false advertising. He also agreed 
to a fine and brief suspension in a settlement of earlier NASD charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The Michigan charges accuse him of misrepresenting life insurance policies by 
falsely "describing the policies as investment programs," "overstating the size 
of the investment returns the consumers would receive, and understating the 
length of time the consumers needed to invest to receive regular income without 
further investment." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, for example, Amaradio allegedly persuaded Gregory Adams of Michigan 
to invest in a retirement plan he said would fully fund Adams' retirement 
within three years. Instead, by 1991, Adams' $80,000 investment had dwindled to 
$55,000. And Amaradio, after moving to Prudential, allegedly tried to persuade 
Adams to cash out his Equitable policy and shift his investments to Prudential.

AIRLINES' LATEST FARE WAR OFFERS CUTS OF UP TO 45% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Northwest Airlines sparked a new round of air fare cuts Friday, with steep 
discounts for spring travel that other major carriers immediately matched. 
</P>
<P>
 The discounts marked the second round of cuts in just a few days. Earlier this 
week, America West announced discounts of up to 52% for travel through June 15 
on its longest U.S. flights. 
</P>
<P>
 Minneapolis-based Northwest, which has often taken the lead in air fare wars, 
Friday offered discounts of up to 45% off current prices. 
</P>
<P>
 American, United, Delta, Continental and Trans World airlines all said they 
would match the discounts in markets where they compete with Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 But travelers will have to plan ahead. Unlike other recent discounts, this 
round requires a 30-day advance purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 The cheaper fares are good for travel in all 50 states; Canada; Cancun, 
Mexico; San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Montego Bay, Jamaica, said Northwest, the 
nation's fourth-largest carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 The discount tickets, for sale until midnight March 11, are good between April 
4 and June 15, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 As examples of the reduced fares, Northwest said passengers can fly round-trip 
between Minneapolis and Los Angeles for $298, down from $558; Memphis and 
Seattle for $318, down from $590, and Los Angeles and New York for $358, down 
from $643. 
</P>
<P>
 The fares require a Saturday night stay and are non-refundable. Other 
restrictions may apply. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-day advance purchase mandate marks a change from typical sales, which 
required travelers to buy tickets 14 days in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't remember the last time we saw one of these," said Jon Ash of Global 
Aviation Associates Ltd. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts said the switch to a 30-day advance purchase requirement is 
a move to keep fares high for business travelers and entice fliers to plan 
trips early. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is leisure-oriented. There aren't many businessmen who can plan well 
ahead," Ash said. 
</P>
<P>
 One industry source, who did not want to be identified, described the 30-day 
advance purchase requirement as a "calculated experiment" by Northwest. A 
spokesman for the airline declined to comment on the reasoning behind the 
latest discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Northwest officials have told Wall Street analysts that fare discounts are 
part of their strategy, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest round of ticket price discounts partly overlaps with the America 
West sale. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the cheapest flight between Los Angeles and New York under the 
Northwest sale is $358, but it could be as low as $318 under the America West 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
 In either case, the discounts are sharply lower than the standard fare of 
$643.

OFF THE TICKER: ON CHILDREN, THEIR CHILDREN AND TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Used to be that kids grew up, got married and created little tax deductions of 
their own. But in the last several years, kids, sometimes as young as 12, have 
been having kids.From a tax standpoint, that can be confusing. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a mother, living with your mother and caring for your child, do you 
file "single" or "head of household"? Is your child your dependent or your 
mother's? What if the child's father contributes support? 
</P>
<P>
 It depends on who pays most of the child's expenses. If the grandparent 
provides more than half the support for the child and its mother, the 
grandparent claims both. If the father is paying less than 50% of the baby's 
expenses, he does not get a deduction. KATHY M. KRISTOF

WESTERN DIGITAL COMPUTER CHIP EXECUTIVE RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A. Travis White, the executive in charge of Western Digital Corp.'s 
unprofitable computer chip business, has resigned for undisclosed reasons, the 
company said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 White was executive vice president and general manager of the company's 
microcomputer products division, which accounted for nearly $38 million -- 
about 10% of the company's $371 million in revenue last quarter. He will stay 
on as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 White was the first senior executive hired under Chairman Charles Haggerty, 
who came to Western Digital as president in June, 1992. White, previously a 
president and chief executive of chip maker LSI Logic Corp.'s Canadian 
operation, was brought in to turn around Western Digital's money-losing chip 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 White's departure was considered a surprise but not a significant blow to 
Western Digital, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can't be a good thing for continuity when an executive leaves after only a 
year," said Paul Weinstein, an analyst at Kidder Peabody & Co. in New York, an 
investment bank. "But I don't think it will hurt the earning power of the 
company." 
</P>
<P>
 The company's computer disk drive business, which accounts for the other 90% 
of sales, has been profitable and is growing. A disk drive permanently stores 
data on a personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Haggerty announced earlier this week that Western Digital's revenue and 
earnings for the third quarter are expected to be significantly higher than 
analysts' original expectations. On Friday, the stock closed at $17.625 a 
share, down 62.5 cents from a day earlier, in trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. The stock had been $15.75 a share on Wednesday, before the 
announcement of earnings expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The chip-making division's sales fell from $45.3 million for the quarter ended 
in December, 1992, to $38.3 million by Dec. 31, 1993. The division's gross 
profits, or pre-tax earnings above the costs of selling products, improved from 
2% of sales for the quarter ended December, 1992, to 31% of sales for the 
quarter ended last December. 
</P>
<P>
 The company does makes a profit on its sales of storage chips, which are used 
in computer disk drives, and on its Paradise brand accelerator cards, which 
boost the video performance of PCs. 
</P>
<P>
 The division as a whole is unprofitable largely because of money lost on 
graphics chips for desktop computers that the company has been unable to bring 
to the market fast enough, said spokesman Robert Blair. 
</P>
<P>
 The company laid off 60 people in January in an unsuccessful attempt to make 
the division profitable. Western Digital also sold its semiconductor 
manufacturing plant in Irvine to Motorola in November for $115 million. 
</P>
<P>
 That sale, which Haggerty credited to White, lowered the company's costs and 
enabled it to buy more chips from a variety of manufacturers who offered better 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the sale, "it looks like they took his (White's) marbles away 
with the sale of the plant," said analyst James Stone at investment bank 
Pennsylvania Merchant Group in Radnor, Pa.

STOCKS CLIMB ON JOBS REPORT; RATES INCH UP

<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview * Stocks staged a convincing rally at the end of a volatile 
week, as the good news of healthy employment in February overcame another day 
of higher interest rates in the bond market. Small stocks led the market. 
</P>
<P>
 * Yields on short-term Treasury securities jumped after the employment report, 
but long-term yields rose only slightly. Stocks 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks rose broadly as bargain hunters continued to comb the market after 
recent sharp price declines. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials added just 7.88 points to 3,832.30, but Wall Street's tone 
was better than what the Dow implied. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners topped losers 13 to 8 on the New York Stock Exchange, the best breadth 
since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 And smaller stocks rebounded sharply. The Russell 2,000 index of smaller 
issues gained 1.56 points to 264.71 and now is just 1% away from its all-time 
high. The Russell rose 1.71 points for the week, despite the turmoil caused by 
surging interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the Dow lost 6.48 points for the week and remains off 3.7% from 
its peak. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors Friday focused on the reported drop in unemployment in February, 
which suggests continuing strength in the economy -- a precursor to higher 
corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders were impressed with the stock market's resilience even as rumors swept 
Wall Street that the Federal Reserve Board may be poised to tighten credit 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts have argued that despite rising interest rates, the stock 
market's rally can continue because rising corporate profits will support share 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Friday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial issues, which have the most to gain from a strong economy, were 
swept up. Ford, Chrysler and GM each gained 1 1/2 points for the day, to 65 
1/8, 59 1/2 and 62, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Other gainers included Eaton, up 1 1/2 to 59 1/2; Cummins, up 1 to 47; 
Ingersoll-Rand, up 1 1/4 to 38 7/8, and Dow Chemical, up 2 1/4 to 64 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology and telecommunications stocks were also in demand. Scientific 
Atlanta surged 3 1/2 to 31 1/8, Intel gained 1 5/8 to 69 5/8, Tellabs leaped 3 
to 57 3/4, Ericsson added 1 1/8 to 45 7/8 and Texas Instruments was up 1 1/4 to 
84 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salomon rose 1/2 to 49 5/8. After the market closed, investor Warren Buffett 
announced that he has raised his stake in the brokerage to 19% from 14.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gibson Greetings eased 1/4 to 23. After the market closed, the greeting card 
maker disclosed that it has lost $3 million as a result of unauthorized 
transactions in interest rate swaps, a type of so-called derivative security. 
The company did not say how the trades occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas markets were strong for a change. Tokyo's Nikkei index gained 360.14 
points to 19,966.00. In Frankfurt, the DAX index added 22.19 points to 
2,060.09, and London's FTSE-100 index rose 31.5 points to 3,278.0.

 Short-term yields finished sharply higher on the heels of the February 
employment report, as investors bet that another Federal Reserve rate hike is 
near. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on three-month Treasury bills closed at 3.62%, up from 3.56% on 
Thursday and 3.48% on Monday. Traders said the rise indicates that the market 
expects the Fed to boost short-term rates at least a quarter of a point again 
soon, matching its Feb. 4 increase.

 But longer-term yields were up only slightly or flat Friday. The 30-year 
T-bond yield closed at 6.83%, unchanged from Thursday, though it hit 6.88% 
during trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Some traders believe that the next Fed hike in short-term rates could actually 
help longer-term yields fall, if investors believe that the Fed's stated goal 
will be met: to keep the economy's growth, and thus inflation, moderate.

 General Dynamics Chairman to Retire: William A. Anders, 60, a former astronaut 
who engineered a dramatic shrinkage of the defense company that also returned 
more than $1.5 billion to stockholders, said he will not stand for reelection 
at General Dynamics' annual meeting May 4. The move was expected after Anders 
retired as chief executive and a company employee a year ago.He will be 
succeeded as chairman by General Dynamics' current chief executive, James R. 
Mellor, 63. The firm, which will make only tanks and submarines after the 
pending sale of its space rocket business is completed, also declared a 2-for-1 
stock split -- payable April 11 to holders of record March 21 -- and boosted 
its quarterly dividend to 35 cents a share from 30 cents, adjusted for the 
split.

ALAN BLINDER GETS NO. 2 SPOT AT FED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton has approved the appointment of White House economist Alan 
Blinder to become vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, making him the 
leading candidate to succeed Chairman Alan Greenspan, according to senior 
Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
 But the White House is still searching for another candidate to fill a second 
vacancy on the Fed's seven-member board of governors. 
</P>
<P>
 Blinder's appointment, which has not been officially announced, comes at a 
critical juncture in relations between the Administration and the Fed. In early 
February, the central bank raised interest rates for the first time in five 
years, sending shock waves through financial markets and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Now some analysts predict that the Fed is poised to raise rates again to 
forestall a resurgence of inflation, and the growing uncertainty about 
Greenspan's plans is roiling the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Fed officials have confused the issue further with contradictory public 
comments suggesting that there is no consensus within the central bank on which 
direction to take interest rate policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The two vacancies on the board give Clinton his first opportunity to appoint 
people who may share the Administration's views on interest rates and monetary 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Blinder has been a key member of the Administration's economic team since 
Clinton took office. The 48-year-old former Princeton University economist has 
been the No. 2 official on the Council of Economic Advisers and has been 
influential within the Administration on a broad range of issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Blinder turned down the appointment to the other vacancy on the Fed 
board, saying he planned to return to Princeton in the near future. That board 
seat came open in February when Wayne Angell, a Reagan Administration 
appointee, stepped down at the end of his term. 
</P>
<P>
 Blinder was more interested when David Mullins, a George Bush appointee and 
the Fed's vice chairman, announced his early resignation Feb. 1. That slot is 
far more attractive, since whoever Clinton appoints as vice chairman will be 
considered the odds-on favorite to replace Greenspan when the chairman's term 
expires in March, 1996.

 Blockbuster May Have to Revise Viacom Offer: Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., 
fighting dissident shareholders over its $8-billion merger with cable company 
Viacom Inc., acknowledged that it may have to revise the deal to win 
stockholder approval. The giant video rental company made the statement in a 
court filing opposing a last-minute attempt by the dissident group to block the 
deal. Blockbuster would buy $1.25 billion of stock from Viacom, which would 
then use the cash in its $10-billion takeover of Paramount Communications Inc. 
Viacom's stock price fell during the bidding contest for Paramount, cutting 
into the value that Blockbuster stockholders would receive in the deal.

 Redstone to Make Paramount Tour: Executives on the Paramount Pictures lot are 
referring to Monday morning as "stand tall time." That's because Viacom 
Chairman Sumner Redstone and Chief Executive Frank Biondi will pay their first 
visit to the studio since acquiring its parent company in a brutal takeover 
battle. The Redstone-Biondi wake-up call comes at 9 a.m., roughly an hour

MASTERS' PIECES; KOTTKE STAKES CLAIM WITH FELLOW GUITARISTS AT STYLE SUMMIT IN 
IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The view from the lofty heights of the "Guitar Summit," the touring program 
that includes jazzman Joe Pass, classical guitarist Pepe Romero and flamenco 
wizard Paco Pena, has been especially revealing for the fourth member, Leo 
Kottke. 
</P>
<P>
 They travel, usually at night, from venue to venue on a tour bus, and as 
Kottke explained Thursday by phone from a stop in San Diego, "I'll mooch a 
cigar from Pepe or Paco, and we'll get into it. It's an opportunity to get 
answers, and they have a lot of guitar lore to pass on and stories coming out 
of their ears.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm continually picking Joe's brain about harmony, and I've been trying to 
get this irregular flamenco rhythm down. We all sit around trying to learn 
something from each other. We can't smoke on the bus, of course, but outside, 
we leave a cloud wherever we go." 
</P>
<P>
 Kottke's respect for his fellow summiteers was apparent. "I've always had a 
huge appetite for music, but I've been slow in my studies. That's why Joe and 
Paco and Pepe are so developed in what they're doing; they haven't been slow."  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of style, too, that I notice and learn from. Pepe will play 
from the sound check right up to his set, two or three complete pieces, no 
noodling or scales. Joe makes a point not to pick up the guitar until he walks 
on stage." Kottke, Pass and Pena met three years ago on a similar tour of 
Australia. "It was so much fun, and the audiences seemed to enjoy it, so we 
decided to repeat it here. There was a bit of a question if anyone, including 
us, could stand that much guitar. But because we come from different 
backgrounds, it works out well. We don't feel at anytime overwhelmed by the 
twang." 
</P>
<P>
 While Pass, Pena and Romero easily are categorized into jazz, flamenco and 
classical styles, Kottke seems the square peg and is listed on the "Guitar 
Summit's" promotional materials as the "steel string" stylist. 
</P>
<P>
 "A friend once called me a 'disenfranchised guitarist,' and that's a category 
I like. I've absorbed something of everything but haven't fit neatly into any 
one kind of pursuit. I think that comes from being self-taught."  
</P>
<P>
 Kottke's own territory has been explored and developed in some two dozen 
albums for a variety of labels over 25 years, recordings that find his lush, 
involved style on six- and 12-string guitars sometimes decorated with his 
witty, often ironic lyrics. His latest release, "Peculiaroso" (on the Private 
Music label), was produced by new friend and associate Ricki Lee Jones, who 
adds her voice on the tune "Turning Into Randolph Scott (Humid Child)." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the album title suggests Thelonious Monk's standard "Mysterioso," 
there's no Monk on the album. "But there is a distant, odd connection," Kottke 
explained. "I love Thelonious Monk and have spent a lot of time with (bassist) 
Buell Neidlinger, who used to play with him. I have heard a lot of Monk stories 
from Buell. I also had the urge to come up with something a little less 
inflated than some of my titles. So I invented this language." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jones got involved in the project after she and Kottke were introduced by a 
mutual friend, bassist John Leftwich. "John brought my last record along on 
Ricki's last tour, and she heard it and liked it. One day John was going up to 
her place in Ojai, and I tagged along. We hit it off immediately and spent the 
day singing and sitting around in sort of a musical mood." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones brought Kottke in for her recording "Traffic From Paradise." "While we 
were recording the tune 'Pink Flamingos,' something I did struck her funny, and 
she hit the floor laughing. And I thought, 'That's the kind of environment I 
want when I record.' Recording can be such an unpleasant setup; you're always 
looking for allies and friends." 
</P>
<P>
 He found the friendship he was looking for, though the process didn't always 
go smoothly. "One day we had an argument about something. She said this, and I 
said that. And after two hours of floundering, I realized she was absolutely 
right. That's why she's a good producer. She hears things I wouldn't notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another time she got all of the vocals and some of the instrumentals out of 
me through trickery. She asked me what else I had for the day, and I said I had 
nothing ready but fragments. So we worked on those, and she had the tape 
running, and that was that. I went in to hear which one to work on next and she 
said we were done. Now that was very nice." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kottke denies that his relationship with Jones is, as a local deejay recently 
suggested, something more than professional. "There isn't anything more going 
on. There's a display of affection that people can see when we perform 
together. We have so much fun. It's the music. And we have a lot in common; 
there's a connection in the way we grew up and the quality of music that we 
both like. But anything more than that would be . . . ." His voice trailed off. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, for now, Kottke's attention is on the guitar summit, in which each 
participant plays solo for half an hour or so. A couple of duets come next, and 
then all four gather on stage to blend styles. "It's kind of a take on Mozart, 
but with Joe and Paco and Pepe and me, there's no way we can approach Mozart 
with the kind of formality you would expect from this kind of piece. So we take 
it somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 * The "Guitar Summit" takes place Sunday at 7 p.m. at the Irvine Barclay 
Theatre, 4242 Campus Drive, Irvine. $24-$28. (714) 854-4646.

CABLE TRAILERS ON BIG SCREEN DRAWING FIRE; MOVIES: PRODUCT ADVERTISING IN 
THEATERS HAS BEEN AROUND FOR SOME TIME BUT, AS ONE STUDIO EXECUTIVE SAYS, 'THIS 
IS DIFFERENT . . . THIS IS COMPETITION.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 More than just "The Birds" has landed at Cineplex Odeon's theaters, which are 
currently playing a trailer for Showtime's upcoming sequel to Hitchcock's 1963 
classic.  
</P>
<P>
 Angry distributors are miffed about having to share screen space with 
competing cable movies that are being promoted along with their theatrical 
trailers. 
</P>
<P>
 The major studios, which produce and distribute the movies that keep theaters 
operating, say they don't need the extra competition from TV in what they 
consider to be their prime advertising venue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Screen advertising has been around for a while and none of the studios really 
like it. But this is different. This is not some neutral product like Reebok. 
This is competition," says Jeff Blake, president of distribution for Columbia 
Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 An angry Barry Reardon, president of distribution at Warner Bros., threatens 
that if the Showtime spot or any cable movie promo "appears (on a trailer) on 
one of our pictures, we will pull the picture. And I guarantee after this 
article runs, Cineplex and all the rest (of the exhibitors) will get the 
message." 
</P>
<P>
 Reardon added that he wasn't the least bit surprised to learn that it was 
Cineplex airing Showtime's spots. "You have to ask yourself, why would an 
exhibitor, a movie-related company, promote something that's going to be shown 
on TV and not sell tickets? Cineplex will do anything for money." 
</P>
<P>
 That then would apply to movie trailers played by Home Box Office, which is 
owned by Warners. HBO, in fact, did run a theatrical trailer for its cable 
movie about AIDS, "And the Band Played On" last August. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reardon's studio competitors echoed his sentiments, including executives at 
Universal, which owns a 42% interest in Cineplex (and produced the original 
Hitchcock film "The Birds"). They were particularly concerned that Cineplex had 
not advised them that the trailer was played with "The Getaway," one of 
Universal's films currently in release. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say movie distributors are worried that cable companies paying for 
trailer time could set a precedent for studios also having to fork out money to 
preview their future movies. 
</P>
<P>
 A Cineplex Odeon official says the "The Birds II: Land's End" Showtime 
trailer, which has been running four weeks in its 1,060 U.S. theaters, cost 
Showtime $140,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Lichtman, Cineplex' executive vice president of marketing, says: "TV 
movies are no different to us than AT&T or Frito-Lay. TV is a totally different 
medium and we don't consider it competition for theatrical features. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main business is movies and we wouldn't do anything to hinder that," 
Lichtman adds. "As for competition for space, we try to maximize the number of 
trailers we show on any film and we would never" bump a feature trailer for a 
TV movie promo or product commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cineplex is one of the few chains to show ads in its theaters. But Showtime's 
sister company National Amusements, both of which are owned by Paramount 
Pictures' new parent, Viacom Inc., is also airing promos for the cable movie. 
Combined, the trailer has been running on 2,100 Cineplex and National Amusement 
screens. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Birds II" sequel begins airing on Showtime March 19, timed to coincide 
with the 30th Anniversary of Hitchcock's original thriller. The cast includes 
Tippi Hedren, who appeared in the 1963 film. It centers on a family who lost a 
son and decides to move their shattered lives to an East Coast island, where 
the oil-slick waters become the target of -- what else? -- bird attacks. In the 
original, the birds attacked Bodega Bay, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Showtime has also run trailers in theaters for two previous Showtime movies: 
John Carpenter's "Body Bags" in August 1993, and another Hitchcock sequel, 
"Psycho 4," in November 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had very positive feedback by doing this in the past," says Mark 
Greenburg, Showtime's senior vice president of marketing. "Having a trailer in 
a theater creates some excitement." 
</P>
<P>
 Would HBO consider a theatrical trailer again for one of its cable movies? "I 
wouldn't rule it out," says Jim Noonan, vice president of corporate affairs. 
"But we would probably use it selectively, on a film that had an important 
message like 'And the Band Played On.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Turner Pictures is not on the bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
 While Turner seems like a natural theater fit with its newly acquired film 
companies Castle Rock Entertainment and New Line Cinema, "the key thing holding 
us back is the cost," says Scot Safon, vice president of marketing for TNT. "In 
evaluating a smart media buy, theaters do not cover the market as well as other 
alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, 'The Birds' is a pre-sold concept," adds Showtime's Greenburg. "What 
better way for us to communicate than go to the people who made the original a 
success in the first place, the moviegoing audience."

TASTE OF CANDY; A MASTER OF COMIC EXAGGERATION; JOHN CANDY, WHO DIED FRIDAY, 
WASN'T HOSTILE; HIS CORE OF SWEETNESS TURNED HIS ESCAPADES INTO JOVIAL PAGAN 
ROMPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Candy was reportedly playing a hapless wagon master in the comedy Western 
"Wagons East" when he died suddenly Friday in Durango, Mexico, at age 43. The 
idea of Candy as wagon master is already enough to split your stitches.  
</P>
<P>
 Candy was a great big bundle of comic exaggeration. Everything about his 
funniness was outsized -- in his movies, and "SCTV" appearances, his appetite 
for victuals was matched by his appetite for grievance, babes and clamor. And 
yet there was nothing bulldozing or hostile about the way Candy came across. 
Even at his most tantrum-tossed, he had a core of sweetness that turned his 
escapades into jovial pagan romps. 
</P>
<P>
 It was this sweetness that allowed his smooth transition into the movie world 
of family-entertainment comedy in the last decade after a glorious seven-year 
run as a John-of-all-trades on "SCTV." Candy's film career made him a star, 
with hits ranging from "Splash" to "Cool Runnings," but for the most part 
Hollywood domesticated his wilder nutty lunges.  
</P>
<P>
 He would appear in John Hughes vehicles such as "Uncle Buck" that seemed 
intent on turning him into a huggy bear. After too many outings in such films 
as "Summer Rental," "Volunteers" and "The Great Outdoors," Candy himself may 
have felt he was primed for less cuddly fare, and he turned in surprisingly 
moving performances in "Only the Lonely," where he was convincingly lovelorn, 
and in "JFK," in a strong cameo as a sleazy New Orleans tipster. Amid the 
kid-stuff japery of "Cool Runnings," he came through as the Jamaican 
bobsledders' disgraced coach with some resonant low notes. 
</P>
<P>
 But, although Candy appeared to be working toward a greater emotional range in 
his movies, it's the full-out comic moments that everyone remembers. As Tom 
Hanks's older brother in "Splash," Candy was a ribald sleazoid whose high point 
comes when he bluffs his way through a security checkpoint by speaking Danish. 
(He learned Danish watching Danish porn.) In "Planes, Trains, and Automobiles," 
the best of his Hughes vehicles, Candy's hulky, shambling grace played off 
Steve Martin's high-anxiety aggravations like a great vaudeville act. The scene 
where they are compelled to share a barely queen-sized motel bed is a classic 
case of hot-wired, slow-burned comedy. Candy is oblivious to the roll and pitch 
he is causing. He regards the cramped quarters as an opportunity for 
togetherness. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Candy's greatest moments, however, were reserved for his "SCTV" career, which 
stretched from 1976 to 1983. His gallery of creeps and clowns was almost 
deliriously inspired. There was Johnny LaRue, with his maligned mustache and 
smoking jackets, forever grousing to try out new shows on the network. (On 
LaRue's exercise show, he would do a few pullups and head for the fridge.) As 
LaRue in "Polynesian Town," a takeoff on "Chinatown," he played a J. J. Gittes 
character who walked around in a grass skirt and went undercover in a 
Polynesian eatery scouting for poisoned ribs.  
</P>
<P>
 He was Dr. Tongue on "Monster Chiller Horror Theater," appearing in such 3-D 
House of Horror Classics as "3-D House of Stewardesses" and "3-D House of Slave 
Chicks." He was Roger Ebert to Joe Flaherty's Gene Siskel as he reviewed the 
fictitious, totally silent and totally awful Robert Altman film "Henry," about 
a man fishing off a pier. He was the Ed McMahon-like second banana to 
Flaherty's Sammy Maudlin. (His rollicking yuks betrayed a resentment that led 
to his walking off the show, Jack Paar style.) He was farm guy Billy Sol Hurok 
on "Farm Film Celebrity Blow-Up," blowing up "real good" the likes of Neil 
Sedaka and Meryl Streep. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, perhaps, were his takeoffs of Orson Welles, overeating on the 
Merv Griffin show, or of Alfred Hitchcock and Ben-Hur, who both ended up, 
inexplicably, inevitably, turning into Curly of the Three Stooges.  
</P>
<P>
 Candy, at his best, was more like 300 stooges -- all of them vivid in their 
knockabout nuttiness. Salute to Candy 
</P>
<P>
 Cable's Comedy Central will salute the late John Candy with an all-Candy block 
of programming tonight.  
</P>
<P>
 It kicks off at 9 p.m. with "Tribute to John Candy," an hourlong collection of 
clips of Candy's work. The rest of the night -- through 4 a.m. -- will be 
filled with episodes of "SCTV," featuring memorable Candy sketches.

RICK DU BROW: SHOWING NETWORKS' STRENGTH; TELEVISION: THE OLYMPICS' RATINGS 
PROVE THAT EVEN WITH THE PROLIFERATION OF CABLE CHANNELS, NETWORKS 'ARE STILL 
THE THREAD THAT TIES THE COUNTRY TOGETHER.'

 In the afterglow of the Winter Olympics, not only CBS, which carried the 
Games, but even its competitors -- ABC, NBC and Fox -- basked to a degree in 
the reminder of network power amid all the talk of a future, 500-channel TV 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The content is always more important than the technology," Howard Stringer, 
president of the CBS Broadcast Group, said in an interview this week, just a 
few days after his network's coverage, sparked by the Nancy Kerrigan-Tonya 
Harding rivalry, resulted in the most-watched Olympic Games -- Winter or Summer 
-- ever shown on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (the networks) are still the thread that ties the country together," said 
Ted Harbert, president of ABC Entertainment. "We are still the meeting place of 
America. It is much more than just the ratings. It shows that anyone who thinks 
network television is a dinosaur just isn't paying attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Don Ohlmeyer, president of NBC West Coast: "This really affirmed that 
the more fractionalized audiences become, the more the audience will seek out a 
communal television viewing experience, whether it's this or the 'Cheers' 
finale. People increasingly are developing a bunker mentality and aren't 
looking to leave their homes because of (such things as) crime. But on the 
information superhighway, the networks are the freeway and cable is the toll 
booth." 
</P>
<P>
 Ohlmeyer complimented CBS for doing "appealing, heartwarming stories that made 
you believe there still are 'heroes' out there in this world. And some of this 
is a reaction to the constant negativism we're surrounded by in television, 
radio and newspapers. Part of what programs like this do is sublimate, they 
allow people to cast aside their cares for a while. And I think that we have to 
listen to the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, whose heavily young audience allowed it to hold its ground during CBS' 
ratings avalanche, concurred in the impact and fallout of the Olympics coverage 
from Lillehammer, Norway. Sandy Grushow, president of the Fox Entertainment 
Group, indicated that the Olympics' "storytelling" gave some clues as to how 
his network -- which, ironically, just outbid CBS for National Football League 
games starting this fall -- will try to lure NFL viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Event television is not created on an assembly line or in the pilot process," 
Grushow said, "and the NFL acquisition puts us closer to being in that game. To 
me, the Olympics was all about good storytelling, human drama, creating 
personal stakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Are there any similarities in Fox's pro football plans? Said Grushow: 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons the NFL has experienced erosion, especially among younger 
viewers, is that, unlike the National Basketball Assn. -- which has been 
extremely successful over the last decade in creating accessible, human 
superstars -- it's hard to get underneath all that gear in professional 
football. It's our goal to take the helmets and shoulder pads off and really 
bring these people into viewers' living rooms as human beings. 
</P>
<P>
 "A bunch of NFL players will appear as themselves, out of uniform, in our 
series programming during the next few months. It's our goal to introduce 
today's football players to the American public in ways I don't believe they've 
been introduced in the past decade." 
</P>
<P>
 All the factors for grabbing a huge Olympics audience certainly came together 
at the right time for CBS. In addition to the frenzy of the Kerrigan-Harding 
showdown and the bad weather that kept many viewers home -- and despite the 
endless plague of commercials, including those terrible spots trying to sell 
the anchor team of Dan Rather and Connie Chung as just plain folks -- the 
national audience simply got hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of it surely was the escapism to the warm, friendly Norwegian atmosphere 
and the striking scenery. Charles Kuralt's sidebar pieces and CBS' willingness 
to poke fun at the goings-on, despite its involvement in them, were other 
pluses. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC's Ohlmeyer, widely experienced in TV sports, sized up CBS' Olympics 
strategy: 
</P>
<P>
 "They took the approach: Forget about the men, they'll come anyway. Go for the 
women. And I think they did it successfully. They wove the story very nicely. 
The advantage of the Winter Games is that you have events that for the most 
part are performance-driven, not necessarily a matter of winning and losing." 
</P>
<P>
 But CBS' Stringer thought there was more. Acknowledging the "wretched hype" of 
the Kerrigan-Harding affair that "we used shamelessly as a hook to get people 
into the Olympics," he thought the Games in Lillehammer "stood for clean 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
 He also returned to his litany defending networks in a high-tech world, 
although CBS has a link with the on-line Prodigy service and, in fact, issued a 
press release about the number of viewers who contacted the broadcast company 
about the Olympics through the interactive medium. 
</P>
<P>
 "The enthusiasm for the future in this country tends to get ahead of itself," 
he said. "Cable comes -- begone, networks. Phone companies come (into TV) -- 
begone, cable. The information highway doesn't mean that in a nation of 250 
million people, 200 million are going to throw out what they have now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all talk about the shared experience, but I do believe the nation needs 
things (like the Olympics) to hold it together. The whole cable, interactive 
world is about doing your own thing. In many ways, what's wrong with America 
now is that everybody is doing their own things and we're not doing things 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 It's quite possible that with CBS' reputation as tradition-oriented -- as 
proven again last season with the success of "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman" -- the 
Winter Games may also have been on the right network at the right moment. Said 
Stringer: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we (CBS) have carefully defined our identity. We've been ridiculed 
for not chasing the 18-to-49-year-olds. Our audience is more grown-up and 
sophisticated and feels, almost instinctively, that sense of what's missing and 
lost. I didn't like the (American basketball) 'Dream Team' at the Barcelona 
Olympics; there was a certain sense of cynicism. That's what I liked about 
Norway, the acknowledgment of days of unrewarded practice." 
</P>
<P>
 The ratings of CBS' Winter Olympics speak for themselves. The two nights 
involving Kerrigan-Harding competition each earned 64% of the audience. CBS won 
every night of the Games and all the demographics. The Olympics rub-off saw 
David Letterman's ratings soar; "CBS This Morning" actually beat "Today" and 
"Good Morning America," and even Rather and Chung landed in first place. Last 
week, CBS' ratings were higher than NBC, ABC and Fox combined. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Olympics, CBS in effect wrapped up its third consecutive championship 
for the prime-time season, which officially ends April 17. The Games turned a 
close race with ABC into a rout, and only a miracle could change the outcome.

ICONTROVERSY; RUSSIAN RELIGIOUS TREASURES ARE FOR SALE AT AN ANAHEIM GALLERY, 
PROMPTING ETHICAL CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Boris N. Yeltsin's 1991 decree that Russian religious treasures be 
returned to the church may seem a distant problem in a distant place. Yet its 
moral implications reach all the way to Anaheim, where a collection of 80 icons 
dating from the 14th to 19th centuries are on display, and for sale, at a 
commercial art gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had people come in here and scold us," said Lori Kaye, owner of the 
gallery that bears her name. "'These belong in Russia!' they say, 'These belong 
in the church. They've all been stolen.' I go into great depth with them, 
explaining that they weren't stolen per se. Many were legally sold under 
Communism. Armand Hammer brought back shiploads (of icons) andsold them in 
department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "These icons have been out of Russia for a long time. How can you ask people 
to respond today to what was legal back then?" 
</P>
<P>
 Icons are religious paintings created in countries of Orthodox faith, usually 
by a monk or pious layman who fasted and prayed before working. Images of 
Christ, Mary and the saints were themselves worshiped and believed to effect 
cures. Icons have also been massively destroyed throughout history, most 
recently by the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection at the Lori Kaye Gallery includes a 14th-Century example 
depicting the life of Elijah priced at $35,000, and a 19th-Century triptych 
once owned by Czar Nicholas II, offered for $120,000. An "Ascension of Christ" 
is offered at $395. All are owned by Svetlana Nenov of Mission Viejo and are 
being sold on consignment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Kaye, Nenov escaped from the Soviet Union after World War II on a 
student visa and ended up in West Berlin. Soviet diplomats, who could come and 
go with impunity, actively dealt in icons at the time, hoping to redeem them 
for much-needed hard currency. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The diplomats) would go to Berlin to try to sell their icons," Kaye said, 
"but often they'd be scratched getting them out, or they were broken when a 
church was destroyed. The icons were often cut out of the iconostasis wall with 
a saw, so there'd be rough edges. 
</P>
<P>
 "The diplomats had to have the icons cleaned, identified and restored before 
they could sell them, and Svetlana was an icon restorer. But they only had 
their local currency to pay her, which she didn't need since she was living in 
Berlin. So she'd restore, say, five icons and, by way of payment, keep one or 
two. Then they'd sell the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, she built her collection on a trade." 
</P>
<P>
 Reached by phone, Nenov responded curtly when asked to confirm the story of 
how she acquired her collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father (in Russia) . . . my mother made the collection -- what's wrong 
with that?" 
</P>
<P>
 As to Yeltsin's recent request that anyone in possession of icons return them 
to the Russian Orthodox Church, Nenov said, "(If) he will pay me, I will return 
them. They are mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaye, who has operated her commercial gallery in Orange County for 10 years, 
at the Anaheim Hilton and Towers for the last two, continued the story 
firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the hotel hosted a religious conference almost two years ago, she put out 
a work by a contemporary Romanian painter and restorer of icons and frescoes, 
Ioan Sarbu -- "a traditional starving artist" living locally but with little 
local demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many frescoes need to be restored around here?" Kaye said. A Fullerton 
dermatologist bought the icon, then asked if she could also find him older 
icons. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband was born in Bulgaria and had heard of a Bulgarian who was 
restoring icons (and who, in turn,) made the connection to Svetlana," Kaye 
said. "The doctor was elated. He's active in his church and believed in the 
power of icons. He put one in every (examination room)." 
</P>
<P>
 Nenov's collection was recently on display between animation cels of Woody 
Woodpecker and a lithograph by Winston Churchill's daughter, Sara. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal status of icons has constantly flip-flopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Exportation was absolutely illegal at the end of the '80s, for instance; then 
the "icon border" opened again with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Yeltsin's 
pronouncement initiated a tug of war between Russian museums, galleries and 
churches, a holy war of the arts that remains unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church has always said that icons are works of reverence and should 
strictly be used to pray to," Kaye said. "(The Communists) disregarded (what 
they felt was) the church's nonsense. . . . They systematically ruined many 
churches, said the icons were works of art and lifted them for museums, 
strictly for their 'historical significance.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Now icons are again (considered) religious artifacts rather than works of 
art. The (art) historians are screaming, saying the church doesn't know how to 
care for icons, that they won't be kept temperature-controlled, that they're 
going to start burning candles in front of them and pouring hot oils on them, 
all the ritualistic stuff that ruins them." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaye characterized Nenov as devoutly religious, yet Nenov had made it clear 
she had no intention of returning the objects. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaye could see her point. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fine line," Kaye said. "I look at it this way. These (icons) have 
changed hands so many times, each time somebody bought them from somebody who 
bought them from somebody. . . . The church has to recognize that along the way 
people paid a lot of money for these, that they acted within the laws of the 
land at the time, that there wasn't reverence for icons at the time. If the 
church wants them back, it should make an offer to buy them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The ethical aspect of dealing in such artifacts continues to arise. Kaye said 
she's next planning a buying trip to Poland, where "all these things from 
synagogues that were desecrated (under Communism) are now for sale. . . . The 
scrolls, the cover for the Torah . . . we can pick those things up for $100 to 
$500, artifacts hundreds of years old that technically belong to somebody's 
synagogue. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "They're wonderful. How they came (to be put up for sale), of course, is so 
tragic -- I'd rather see them end up in the hands of a Jewish family that 
survived," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laws in most European countries prohibit the export of items more than 50 
years old, but Kaye said: "As long as we can get them out, we will. It's one of 
those laws like the speed limit: Everybody knows it's 55 and everybody drives 
faster, and if you're caught . . . the worst that can happen (in this case) is 
confiscation." 
</P>
<P>
 * Svetlana Nenov's icons remain on display through March at the Lori Kaye 
Gallery in the Anaheim Hilton and Towers, 777 Convention Way, Anaheim. Hours: 
10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays; 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sundays. (714)

 Howard to Shoot the 'Moon': Ron Howard will direct Imagine Films' tentatively 
titled movie "Lost Moon." It's based on the true story and upcoming non-fiction 
book by astronaut James A. Lovell Jr. and Jeffrey Kluger about the near 
disastrous 1970 Apollo 13 moon mission that went awry when a small explosion 
inside the capsule occurred just outside the Earth's orbit. Tom Hanks is 
expected to star as Lovell, who was the commander of the Apollo crew. Howard's 
Imagine partner Brian Grazer will produce the movie, which begins production in 
July.

 * The Latest on 'List': "Schindler's List" has attracted attention on two 
international fronts. About 500 filmgoers were evacuated when an anonymous 
caller threatened to set off a bomb at a premiere of the Holocaust film in the 
southwestern German city of Karlsruhe, police said Friday. A bomb squad found 
no explosives in the city center cinema, where Karlsruhe's mayor and city 
council members were attending the showing Thursday night. Meanwhile, the 
Philippine government Friday overturned its own censor's decision to cut sex 
scenes from director Steven Spielberg's Oscar-nominated drama and ordered it to 
be shown in its entirety.

 * Erasing Box-Office Doubts: If everything goes as 20th Century Fox suspects, 
"Mrs. Doubtfire" will cross into the $200-million box-office stratosphere this 
Sunday. "We never thought it would get to this," said Fox executive Vice 
President Tom Sherak. "These kinds of movies are like shooting stars and every 
studio hopes for them." At $200 million, "Mrs. Doubtfire" will become 1993's 
second-highest-grossing film (trailing "Jurassic Park") and the 16th highest of 
all time in the United States and Canada. 
</P>

 * Full 'Disclosure': Demi Moore will co-star opposite Michael Douglas in 
"Disclosure," a Warner Bros. film based on the Michael Crichton novel about 
sexual harassment, according to trade reports. Moore will play an executive 
charged with sexual harassment by a male co-worker who also happens to be her 
ex-lover. The studio would not confirm the casting on Friday. POP MUSIC

be honored on April 7; tickets for the show scheduled tonight will be honored 
April 9 and tickets for Monday's postponed show will be honored April 10. 
Refunds also can be obtained at point of purchase. New dates have not been

 Streisand Auction: A Christie's New York auction of 20th-Century decorative 
and fine arts from Barbra Streisand's collection on Thursday brought in $5.77 
million in sales -- well above the $4-million estimate -- and set a record for 
artist Tamara de Lempicka. "Adam and Eve," Lempicka's stylized painting of a 
nude couple in the Garden of Eden, valued at $600,000 to $800,000, was sold to 
an anonymous private collector for $1.98 million. A Tiffany "Cobweb" lamp was 
expected to command the auction's highest price of $800,000 to $1 million, but 
an unidentified buyer snapped it up for a mere $717,500. TELEVISION

 Rumor Mill: Elizabeth Taylor's attorney denied rumors circulating around 
Hollywood this week that his client has agreed to star in a new TV series 
called "Daughters of Eve." "There's been no commitment by either side. She 
hasn't given her consent for anything except that she will talk (with 
Paramount)," said Neil Papiano. Paramount also released a statement this week 
saying: "We are internally developing a project with international scope and 
designing it with the hope that Elizabeth Taylor would star in it." The 
prime-time series, to be shot partly in London and Paris, reportedly would star 
Taylor as the wealthy matriarch of a high-society family. STAGE

 And the Winner Is . . .: Cecilia Fannon has won the $5,000 top prize in South 
Coast Repertory's sixth annual California Playwrights Competition for "Green 
Icebergs," a comic drama about modern sexual manners. That makes two SCR awards 
in a row for Fannon, 43, of Newport Beach. Last year she won second prize for 
"To Distraction." This year the $3,000 second prize went to David Ford, a Bay

 * 'Damn Yankees' Goes to Bat: Most of the New York critics liked Jack 
O'Brien's staging of "Damn Yankees," which has moved from San Diego's Old Globe 
Theatre to Broadway, but David Richards of the New York Times didn't join the 
celebration. "It was never exactly a classic musical, just a loud and flashy 
one," he wrote, and he dismissed the efforts of the new leads, Victor Garber 
and Bebe Neuwirth. Still, Linda Winer of Newsday found it "an enormously 
appealing, sweet and foolish trifle that wears its age as proudly as a piece of 
pop art," the New York Post said the revival "hit a home run," and the Daily 
News called it "a jolt that seems alternately ridiculous and refreshing."

DONNER SAGA SIDESTEPS CANNIBALISM; TELEVISION: 'ONE MORE MOUNTAIN,' AIRING 
SUNDAY, EXPLORES THE COURAGE OF PIONEERS AS THEY CROSSED THE SIERRA NEVADA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 "One More Mountain," a TV movie airing at 9 p.m. Sunday on ABC, is about the 
ill-fated 1846 Donner Party, many of whom resorted to cannibalism to stay alive 
after they were trapped in the Sierra Nevada mountains during the harsh winter. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not, however, about cannibalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "People tuning into our show will be a little disappointed if they come 
looking for that," said star Meredith Baxter. "We are the people who didn't eat 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 "One More Mountain" focuses on the Reed family, part of a small group that 
separated from the original 86-member party and did not revert to cannibalism. 
Baxter and Chris Cooper play Margaret and James Reed, co-founders of the Donner 
Party that was heading west for California. 
</P>
<P>
 The wealthy Reeds and their four children were resented by the rest of the 
wagon train, which was composed mostly of Irish and German immigrants. They 
considered Reed arrogant and chose Reed's friend, George Donner, to lead them.  
</P>
<P>
 When the wagon train got snowed in, Reed vowed to make it to California to 
gather supplies and return with a rescue party. Margaret and a few other 
families decided not to continue with the Donners and, instead, waited several 
miles away in a camp beside a lake. They survived the numerous blizzards by 
eating hides and drinking glue. 
</P>
<P>
 Making "One More Mountain" in frigid Calgary late last year was an arduous 
task for the cast and crew.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was bloody cold," Baxter recalled. "We were outside 97% of the time. We 
had our big warm boots, our big warm jackets and we could go inside our motor 
homes and craft services would bring us coffee. We still froze." 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the most difficult to shoot were some of the night scenes," Cooper 
said. "We had to behave as if it were a summer evening. It was a bit of a trial 
for the camera people to disguise the smoke coming out of our mouths. We had to 
stop the chattering and shaking for that scene, which probably involved five 
hours being out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, said director Dick Lowry, "everybody in the cast and crew took up the 
challenge in a wonderful way. Nobody was inclined to complain because you felt 
silly complaining in the face of knowing what the real people had done. I told 
somebody we were kind of like the postman: neither rain nor sleet nor dark of 
night would keep us from shooting this movie." 
</P>
<P>
 The aristocratic Margaret is a far cry from Elyce Keaton, the thoroughly 
modern wife and mother Baxter played in the 1980s on the sitcom "Family Ties." 
The actress acknowledged she had a difficult time portraying a 19th-Century 
woman who had no input in her husband's plans to uproot their family from 
Illinois to go West. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I have made that journey in my life not to be someone who goes 'OK,' 
to one who will be somebody who will fight for what I want and figure out what 
I want and then make a stand for it," she said. "I felt it was such a 
regression. The men were moved by such lust for adventure to be the first ones 
out there. Even in the face of incredible discomfort and hardship, they did it 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Producer John Kuri ("Conagher") endured his own trials in getting the film 
made. A history buff, Kuri spent the better part of the last decade trying to 
bring the Reeds' story to the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "What always drew me to developing the story initially was the amazing thought 
of Margaret Reed being left with her four children while James is off trying to 
get back, and that enormous guilt he had to have felt," Kuri said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was his dream which put them where they were. But Margaret never lost 
sight of her beliefs. She just absolutely knew her children would survive and, 
knowing that, she knew she didn't want them to live with the horrible memory of 
eating human flesh. That emotional strength she gave her children is what kept 
them alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuri had numerous conversations with networks about the project. "Sometimes I 
would have an audience that would be receptive to it, but I'd have an encounter 
that it was not commercial enough or someone would want to exploit the 
sensationalistic side." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kuri refused to allow his Reeds' story to become "Alive II." In fact, 
cannibalism is only mentioned twice in the movie. "This is not what the story 
is about. It's a love story. It's a story that has a lot of spiritualism to it. 
It's the kind of thing that should encourage people."

NEWPORT BEACH PLAYWRIGHT GETS TOP PRIZE FROM SCR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A television writer with six full-length plays in her drawer, none of them 
produced, has taken top honors in South Coast Repertory's sixth annual 
California Playwrights Competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecilia Fannon, 43, who lives in Newport Beach, won the $5,000 top prize for 
"Green Icebergs," a comic drama about modern sexual manners set in Italy and 
involving a pair of American couples who meet by accident on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second year in a row that Fannon has been awarded a prize in SCR's 
statewide contest. In 1993, the native New Yorker took the $3,000 second prize 
for "To Distraction," a dark comedy about a woman having a bad life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels unbelievable, truly unbelievable," Fannon said by phone from Hawaii, 
where she was traveling with her husband, Jonathan Bliss, also a writer. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's second prize went to David Ford, a director and performance artist 
who lives in Oakland, for "Too Good to Be True." His drama revolves around a 
national AIDS charity whose employees are forced to examine their motives when 
the organization undergoes changes in leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 SCR uses the competition to encourage playwrights and to find unproduced 
scripts for possible production. Both winning plays will be given NewSCRipt 
readings this season: "Too Good to Be True" on March 14 and "Green Icebergs" on 
May 2. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the theater also gave cash awards of $1,000 each to three 
honorable mentions: Allison Gregory of Los Angeles for "Forcing Hyacinths"; 
Kate Hawley of Santa Cruz for "Simply the Thing She Is," and Glen Merzer of 
Santa Monica for "Bad Press." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SCR dramaturge Jerry Patch, one of the competition judges, described Fannon as 
"a writer who makes extraordinary things happen out of apparently ordinary 
circumstances." He said "Green Icebergs" reminded him of Noel Coward. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not British, and it's not arch, and it doesn't sound like Coward," he 
said. "But it makes me think of him in terms of spirit. Fannon's strategy is 
similar to his. They create a world that is comedic but also committed to 
presenting a view of existence from which you are to infer serious things about 
the nature of living." 
</P>
<P>
 Fannon writes for "Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego," an educational 
children's cartoon that airs Saturday mornings on the Fox network. During the 
mid-'80s she was a head writer for the CBS daytime soap "The Guiding Light." 
</P>
<P>
 But she has been writing plays for years. Two others -- "Wowee Maui" and 
"Learning to Float" -- were submitted to the SCR competition in 1990 and 1991; 
both finished out of the money but made a short list of finalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plays roll around in my head like marbles," she said. "When they're ready to 
come out, they just spill out. But it's not as if I haven't thought about them. 
They roll around for a long time in there." 
</P>
<P>
 They also seem to roll around the country without landing at any particular 
destination. "To Distraction," for example, won a prize in 1992 from L.A. 
Theatre Works, which gave it a radio production directed by JoBeth Williams. 
But a promised broadcast on KCRW, supposed to be part of the prize, somehow 
never materialized. And while a handful of theaters also showed interest in the 
play -- including Actors Theatre of Louisville, the Denver Center Theatre and 
San Jose Repertory -- no productions resulted. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fannon's unproduced status could change with "Green Icebergs."  
</P>
<P>
 Said Patch: "We're very bullish on it." 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 275 scripts were submitted to the competition this year, roughly 
the same number as last year, theater officials noted. The prize money was 
donated by the American Express Co. PLAYWRIGHTS COMPETITION 
</P>

OFFSHORE HARVEST; SHELLFISH GO FROM OIL PLATFORMS TO DINNER PLATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Poised on the ocean's surface like a navy of giant, floating insects, the 
offshore oil platforms here are viewed as unhealthy, polluting eyesores by some 
and curiosities by others. 
</P>
<P>
 To scientists, however, the platforms -- which sit on stilts extending as far 
as 700 feet to the ocean floor -- provide nothing short of a biological 
miracle. "They are similar to an island with a fairly steep shelf," said Bob 
Meek, whose doctorate in marine biology comes from UC Santa Barbara. "They are 
like vertical artificial reefs with huge (sunlit) zones. You just don't see 
this density of life" in many other places. 
</P>
<P>
 Of particular interest to Meek are the hordes of black mussels -- succulent 
water-siphoning shellfish -- that cling to the platforms' stilts by the tens of 
thousands. He has spent the last 14 years creating a small industry around 
them. The result: a generation of Orange County restaurant patrons unaware that 
the shellfish on their plates often come from the platforms off their 
coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like it's almost still alive," Mike Turley, a visitor from 
Pittsburgh, said recently, staring warily at a pot of the stuff at Walt's 
Wharf, a popular seafood restaurant in Seal Beach. "They look a little risky." 
</P>
<P>
 But looks can be deceiving, according to Pat Wells, a sanitary engineering 
associate with the state Department of Health Services, whose job includes 
testing the oil-platform mussels regularly for various toxins. In fact, he 
says, these mussels are among the cleanest in the state. "If I had to eat 
something raw," Wells said, "I'd eat it off those platforms. This is probably 
the highest quality of shellfish meat sold in California and maybe the entire 
country; they have a near-perfect monitoring record. Nothing else comes close." 
</P>
<P>
 Meek, 48, got his start in 1980 after the company he had founded -- Ecomar 
Marine Consulting of Santa Barbara -- conducted a study for Shell Oil Co. 
examining the marine growth on the company's oil platforms from Point 
Conception to Huntington Beach. What they found, Meek said, was a rich 
underwater community, dominated by mussels, with a predictable rate of growth 
and replenishment -- in short, perfect conditions for commercial harvesting. 
</P>
<P>
 His proposal to provide the regular scraping required by oil platforms at a 
low price in exchange for permission to sell the mussels was met with initial 
skepticism by health officials. Over time, he was able to establish the safety 
of the meat. Their healthful quality, officials now believe, is due to the 
platforms' relatively long distance from the polluted waters near shore -- 
several miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Ecomar harvests up to 500,000 pounds of mussels a year from 12 
platforms in Southern California owned by five oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of those mussels, according to Meek, come from four Shell Oil Co. 
platforms off Huntington Beach where Ecomar began harvesting just last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to clean the (platform) anyway," said Corbin Weed, maintenance 
supervisor of Shell's Platform Ellen, which pumps about 10,000 barrels of oil a 
day from its position seven miles off Huntington Beach. Without regular 
scraping, he said, the buildup of mussels and other organisms on the platform's 
legs would cause enough friction to threaten its stability in high ocean 
currents. Until recently, Weed said, the company hired divers to regularly pull 
the mussels loose and drop them to the ocean floor. "Doing it this way," he 
said, "is about 33% cheaper." 
</P>
<P>
 Shell spokesman Bill Gibson said: "It was a business decision, but one that 
felt good too. There's no reason you can't have good business and good 
environment too." That good environment is much in evidence on the three days 
each week that Meek and his divers catch the Shell Oil Co. boat from Long Beach 
Harbor to Platform Ellen. Working in two-man teams, they descend to a depth of 
about 50 feet where one scrapes mussels off the columns while the other holds a 
large underwater vacuum hose that sucks them to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The underwater scene is eerily beautiful, punctuated by huge vertical legs 
with crossbeams every 50 feet covered by thick blankets of pink strawberry 
anemones mixed with rock scallops and brittle stars. A variety of fish hang 
nearby, awaiting the succulent morsels regularly provided by the debris of the 
divers' work. And everywhere a sense of lushness pervades, an image of nature 
thriving wildly amid mechanical human contrivance. 
</P>
<P>
 Entire fleets of sport fishing boats stop here regularly, preying on the scads 
of bass and cabezon in the area. And as a colony of seals suns itself on the 
platform's lower level, the wetsuit-clad mussel harvesters carefully sort their 
catch before tossing it into huge bins for the long trip home. 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling by boat and truck, the mussels -- about 2,000 pounds a day from this 
platform alone -- are taken to a processing plant in Santa Barbara and, within 
24 hours, delivered to restaurants up and down the coast, half of which are in 
the Los Angeles-Orange County area. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them is Walt's Wharf, where patrons can enjoy a pot full of the little 
critters for $12.95. "We were using New Zealand greenlip mussels," manager John 
Ryan said, "but these are fresher, plumper and juicier." 
</P>
<P>
 Since first being offered two months ago, he said, the oil-platform mussels 
have become a major hit, with about 75% of the restaurant's mussel-eating 
customers switching to the local brand. "They kind of melt in your mouth," Ryan 
said. "People like them a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 That certainly seemed to be the case one recent evening at the restaurant as 
several patrons ordered the mussels as appetizers. "They're pretty good," said 
Jennifer Laythe, 21, of Costa Mesa. "We were in a shellfish mood." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the dining room at the Eppich family gathering, the consensus seemed 
much the same. "I'm really picky about my seafood," admitted Kristin Eppich, 
25, a kindergarten teacher from Huntington Beach, "but I had more than one." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone, however, was completely enamored of the little black shellfish 
that, less than a day before, had been clinging for their lives to the beams of 
an offshore oil platform. Mary Eppich, Kristin's mother, managed to get through 
her entire meal without tasting a single mussel. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason was simple, she later explained. "They give me the willies." Mussel 
Bound At four oil rigs off Orange County's shoreline, mussels are harvested, 
transported and sold to local restaurants. The platforms provide a vertical 
artificial habitat replete with a variety of fish and other sea life. Beneath 
The Surface Oil rigs and artificial reefs attract fish because they are fixed 
objects. Fish remain near the rigs because the structures often provide both 
food and shelter. Below, some of the organisms and the zones they inhabit.: *

FORMER CHARITY DIRECTOR GETS FOUR-YEAR TERM; COURTS: JUDGE REJECTS CLAIMS THAT 
CLYDE E. WEINMAN, ALSO FINED $5,000, WAS A SCAPEGOAT. 'THE BOTTOM LINE, THIS IS 
THEFT,' SHE SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 A Lake Forest man depicted as a reverse Robin Hood for stealing from the poor 
to support his lavish lifestyle was sentenced Friday to four years in prison 
for diverting nearly $450,000 from a charity for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde E. Weinman, 44, was executive director of Irvine Temporary Housing when 
he was arrested in November, 1992, and charged with forging more than 594 
checks. The prosecution said Weinman used ill-gotten gains to lease a 
Mercedes-Benz and turn his house into a "virtual Taj Mahal" that included a 
sauna, pool and extensive landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of friends and neighbors sent letters praising Weinman as a caring 
generous man, and others appeared in court Friday to ask that he be spared a 
prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Weinman's teen-age daughters sobbed and his wife and young son looked 
on, Orange County Superior Court Judge Jean M. Rheinheimer said she found no 
reason to show Weinman such leniency when he was stealing from the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every dollar you got, they didn't get," Rheinheimer said, calling the deeds 
"selfish" acts. "That's too many victims." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge rejected defense claims that Weinman was a "scapegoat" for a poorly 
run organization that was barely solvent. He said he used his own money to help 
keep the program afloat, and was wrongly accused of theft when he tried to 
retrieve that same money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line, this is theft," said Rheinheimer, who said Weinman swindled 
taxpayers, the federal government -- which helps underwrite the charity with 
grants -- and donors who mistakenly believed the money would go to the poor. 
The judge said she also did not believe defense assertions that Weinman did not 
set out to steal from the charity. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was sophistication and planning from the start," Rheinheimer said, 
noting that Weinman dismissed a "watchdog" bookkeeper after he arrived at the 
Irvine-based charity. "There was an egregious, egregious violation of trust in 
this case."  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the prison term, the judge also ordered Weinman to pay a $5,000 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinman showed no emotion during the hearing, but turned repeatedly to look at 
at his family. 
</P>
<P>
 The forgery and grand theft charges sent shock waves through community members 
who looked up to Weinman as a tireless worker on behalf of the poor. Since 
1978, he seemingly sought out jobs that were personally -- not financially -- 
rewarding. But authorities say that is a misleading portrait of Weinman, one 
that allowed him to hoodwink those who trusted him. 
</P>
<P>
 During the sentencing hearing, the judge barred Deputy Dist. Atty. William 
Overtoom from presenting additional allegations that Weinman stole from other 
nonprofit organizations. Overtoom said Weinman was never charged in those 
incidents, but the allegations illustrate that Weinman has a history of such 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said Weinman was suspected of stealing food and clothing while 
working as an administrator with Goodwill Inc. of Orange County in the early 
1980s and receiving kickbacks from a computer services supplier while working 
at a poverty law center in Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Weinman has denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 While he did not testify at trial, Weinman told The Times in a January 
interview that his methods were "unorthodox" but insisted he never intended to 
steal from the charity. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor, former secretary and friend testified Friday that Weinman was a 
generous and giving man who would never intentionally harm anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Jack M. Earley told the judge that Weinman takes 
responsibility for his mistakes, but also noted that Weinman's "fall from 
grace" came as he was trying to fulfill a career in charitable works that 
"almost required sainthood." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinman was convicted in January of one count of grand theft and 12 counts of 
forgery. While some of the more than $400,000 in forged checks was used to 
underwrite legitimate costs of Irvine Temporary Housing, at least $80,000 was 
used to put cash in Weinman's pocket and pay personal bills including gas, 
water and cable, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charity officials said they were kept in the dark so long because Weinman 
showed board members financial flow charts indicting things were going 
smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinman earned $30,000 a year with ITH and declared bankruptcy about the same 
time as his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Margie Wakeham, the ITH administrator who reported the embezzlement after 
learning about bounced checks and unpaid bills, said Friday the program is 
slowly recovering from its losses.

LOCAL PENSION SPIKING BILLS TOTAL $3.9 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BRAZIL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several Orange County cities and agencies have been billed a combined $3.9 
million by the state retirement system because they allowed near-retirement 
employees to pad their pensions -- a little-known, but common abuse that will 
become illegal come July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In Huntington Beach, 34 employees got an average raise of $79,000 in the year 
before retirement, according to a report compiled by the state Public Employees 
Retirement System. In Orange, five employees got an average increase of $58,000 
in their next-to-last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees' pensions can be increased by hundreds of dollars a month if they 
are allowed to tack unused sick leave, vacation, car allowances and other perks 
onto their final year's salary, which is the basis for determining pension 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 The abuses in Huntington Beach and Orange were among the worst in a recently 
released report in which the state also dunned Anaheim, Costa Mesa, La Habra, 
Los Alamitos, Newport Beach, the Santa Margarita Water District, and more than 
70 other cities and agencies around the state for so-called "salary spiking." 
</P>
<P>
 "They do it selectively. They don't do it for everybody," said Gary M. Jones, 
chief of the state retirement system's member services division. 
</P>
<P>
 A common practice since the early 1980s, salary spiking sparked a public 
outcry about three years ago when a handful of especially egregious cases 
received statewide publicity. Among the most notorious was that of ex-Anaheim 
City Manager William O. Talley, whose salary was increased from $97,390 yearly 
to $159,109 within the year before he resigned in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 While not illegal, spiking was -- and is -- considered an abuse by state 
officials because it doesn't give the retirement system enough time to save the 
money required to pay an inflated pension. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most city officials aren't willing to defend extreme cases, some view 
spiking as a legitimate way to reward longtime employees and managers, who 
don't make nearly what their counterparts in private industry do. 
</P>
<P>
 In Anaheim, for example, police and fire officials have been routinely allowed 
to boost their final year's salary the equivalent of 2% to increase their 
retirement pay. Managers in Anaheim have been allowed to add 7% to their 
last-year pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The case that attracted so much attention in Anaheim, Talley's, was an 
anomaly, according to the city's acting human resources director H. David Hill, 
because Talley had negotiated the spike when he was hired. 
</P>
<P>
 "From our point of view," Hill said, "the state encouraged this and permitted 
it. It was just part of the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, PERS issued guidelines, bulletins, to us on how to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 If any PERS bulletin was interpreted as advocating salary spiking, said PERS' 
Jones, then it was "misinterpreted." 
</P>
<P>
 "It may have been routine, but we weren't aware of it," Jones said. "I think 
they (cities and agencies) were either operating between the lines of the law, 
certainly stretching the law, and, in some cases, breaking it." 
</P>
<P>
 A law passed by the Legislature last year, SB53, bans the manipulation of 
retirement benefits in this fashion as of June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, PERS has sent bills to cities and public agencies throughout the 
state totaling $24 million for allowing retirees to artificially inflate their 
final-year salaries. Torrance in Los Angeles County had 27 employees with 
inflated salaries totaling $3.6 million, an average of $133,000 each, a figure 
that would substantially increase their retirement pay rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities can pay the state money to cover the inflated sums with a lump payment, 
work out a payment plan or have it deducted from any surplus funds in their 
retirement account. In many cases, the cities have already anted up; in Orange 
County, $3.1 million of the $3.9 million has already been repaid.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; MERCHANTS' FAITH IN FEDERAL AID WANES; 
BUSINESS: GORE'S VISIT LAST MONTH RAISED HOPES FOR QUICK LOANS. BUT THERE'S 
BEEN LITTLE ACTION SINCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's been 15 days since Vice President Al Gore made his visit to the Cal State 
Northridge campus and the flattened Devonshire Mason Plaza, where he hugged and 
hobnobbed with frazzled merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 For Eric Rodriguez, who owns Pacific Aquatics West, a tropical fish store 
destroyed in the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, Gore's visit gave him hope 
that, with the federal government behind him, he could revive his 2-year-old 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 He shook hands with Gore and Erskine B. Bowles, who heads the federal Small 
Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "A FEMA guy took my number and I was like, 'Whoa! These guys mean business,' " 
Rodriguez said. "Then, nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, the vice president was here shaking hands with everybody and I felt like 
the government was really working for me," said Rodriguez as he surveyed his 
gutted store. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I'm about to become homeless, and I won't make it back without government 
help," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Gore returned to Washington, the backslapping around the damaged 
shopping center has ceased, the handshaking has been replaced with head 
shaking, and some of the small-business owners most affected by the earthquake 
are starting to lose confidence in the politician's promises. 
</P>
<P>
 Elie Root has operated a small locksmith shop at the shopping center for the 
last 15 years. At age 70, Root is perhaps not as idealistic as Rodriguez, 29, 
and he doesn't kid himself about what a delay in receiving government aid will 
mean. 
</P>
<P>
 "People won't come in here because I still have a yellow tag on my wall," said 
Root, who secures his shop with boards where windows used to be, locking it all 
behind a sliding metal gate. "If my business dies, I will die with it," he said 
of his shaky financial position. "I can't hold out another three months. No 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Small Business Administration field office in Burbank say 
they are processing $20 million in loans to homeowners and business owners 
daily. There is no hard and fast rule about how quickly business loans can be 
reviewed and approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the more than 14,500 business loan applications received from local 
businesses damaged or otherwise affected in the quake, little more than 500 
have been approved, said Kris Lancaster, an SBA spokesman in Burbank. Overall, 
there have been more than 100,000 loan applications issued since the 
earthquake. So far, the agency has distributed a total of $235 million, but 
less than $25 million to business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster said the federal agency is approving loans faster in the wake of the 
Northridge quake than any other disaster in U. S. history, but he could not 
place a time limit on Rodriguez's loan or any others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to take three months," he said, referring to Root's estimate. 
"I can't give you an exact date for all the applicants, but it won't take that 
long." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberta Zaporski, 44, who operates Golden Valley Travel, says she understands 
how it could take awhile for the wheels of bureaucracy to start churning. She 
received word Thursday that a loan officer would be assigned to her case within 
the next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will just continue to call and drive them out of their minds," she 
promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore spokeswoman Lorraine Voles is quick to assure that everything possible is 
being done by the vice president's office and SBA, and she dismisses the notion 
that visits by Gore or President Clinton have amounted to little more than good 
public relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the vice president was there to offer them hope," Voles said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both the President and the vice president have been very responsive, but 
there's only so much we can do."

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; FEMA SOFTWARE FAILURE WILL DELAY RELIEF 
EFFORT; TECHNOLOGY: AGENCY COULD NOT IDENTIFY WHICH VICTIMS' APPLICATIONS WERE 
AFFECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A FEMA software failure will delay help for about 33,000 quake victims, 
officials acknowledged Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Federal Emergency Management Agency could not yet identify 
whose applications were affected by the delays, how long the delays will be or 
what caused the failure. FEMA had told applicants that they should expect an 
answer to their aid requests in seven to 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 However, they said none of the aid applications or inspection surveys were 
lost in the glitch, which originated at the agency's central processing office 
in Redwood City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing has been lost," said Frank Kishton, FEMA's California coordinator for 
the Northridge earthquake relief effort. "We certainly know that our seven- to 
10-day plan has not been met on these. I can't say what the delay is or what 
the dates were that the inspections took place. We have it fixed now." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Kishton, the delay was caused when a "host" computer failed to 
automatically transfer the electronic data from inspectors' portable field 
computers into a central processing unit in the office in Redwood City. 
</P>
<P>
 The host computer acts as a link for the office, sending and receiving 
information from hand-held computers used by field inspectors to survey damaged 
homes, Kishton said. The central processing unit acts as the main storage unit 
for the applications and inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA workers use the information in the central processing unit to determine 
eligibility for federal aid, Kishton said, as well as the timeline for when the 
checks will be issued. Somehow, Kishton said, the host computer never sent the 
data from 33,000 field inspections to the central processing unit. The error 
was discovered during a systems check performed during the past 10 to 12 days, 
Kishton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kishton said the agency expects to have the data from all 33,000 applicants 
transferred to the central processing unit by Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kishton was hesitant to label the failure a setback for the computer 
system, which is being used in a disaster for only the second time. It was 
first used in last year's Southern California firestorms. 
</P>
<P>
 "This obviously is the first shot with such large numbers," Kishton said. "In 
the volume we're dealing with, we don't consider it a setback." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the formerly used system, inspectors filled out paperwork in their 
surveys of damaged buildings and traveled back and forth to the central 
processing office to receive addresses and data on applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 The new system allows the inspectors to receive the applicant's information 
electronically, conduct the inspection with software on their portable computer 
and transmit it on phone lines with a modem. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, FEMA has received 320,000 applications for emergency housing or the 
individual family grant program, 90,000 more than officials said they expected. 
FEMA has conducted 215,000 inspections with the new system, of which 131,319 
cases have received $348 million in assistance from the emergency housing 
program, Kishton said. 
</P>
<P>
 But FEMA inspectors said the damage has already been done as applicants sit by 
the mailbox waiting to receive money that, in some cases, may have been delayed 
by more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've already gotten four or five calls from people wondering what the hell 
happened," said one inspector, who asked not to be identified. "One I got today 
was (inspected) the 27th of January."

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; CAT THAT BECAME A SYMBOL OF HOPE DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Tiffany, the cat whose tale of will and survival captured hearts as far away 
as Europe, died early Friday, her body wracked by the effects of malnutrition 
and dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-year-old Persian mix was found Sunday, her body withered after spending 
41 days locked with no food, only rainwater in the storage closet where she 
fled after the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that she had survived the ordeal, something her veterinarians called 
highly unusual if not downright miraculous, had made her an international 
symbol of hope. Calls from newspapers in London and Germany poured into the 
Animal Clinic of Santa Clarita, where she had been recovering. CBS News was at 
the clinic preparing to do a live report when the cat went into cardiac and 
respiratory arrest early Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterinarian Sandy Sanford had checked Tiffany at 2:45 a.m. before returning 
to unlock the clinic doors for the CBS crew about an hour later. Tiffany's body 
started to shut down about 4 a.m. as fluid seeped into her chest, Sanford said. 
</P>
<P>
 The veterinarian spent 20 minutes trying to save her with cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation, oxygen and drug therapy. But the cat, who had lost about 60% of 
her body weight in her ordeal, didn't respond. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the back of my mind I knew this was a potential complication," Sanford 
said. "But I was hoping, since she'd gone this long, I was hoping she would 
make it. . . . It's a crummy day." 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany's owner, Laurie Booth, was on her way to meet the CBS crew and arrived 
at the veterinary clinic minutes after Sanford stopped trying to revive the cat 
at 4:21 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Booth remained distraught Friday, blaming herself for Tiffany's fate and 
questioning how the cat could have been so close -- in her neighbor's storage 
closet -- and not have been found. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like it's my fault because I never heard her cry, because she was so 
close but I didn't hear anything," she said. "I kept calling 'Tiffany!' She was 
right there all the time, probably praying I would open the door, and I was 
praying I would find her. It's just bothering me so much." 
</P>
<P>
 But Booth was thankful that she'd found Tiffany alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't die alone in a cold place. She knew she was loved," Booth said. 
"She definitely was a little fighter." 
</P>
<P>
 After Tiffany is cremated, Booth will keep her ashes in her living room. But 
Booth, who has two other cats, has no plans to replace the cat she found 
abandoned in Riverside five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to get another kitten," she said, explaining that when she ran 
newspaper advertisements in her search for the cat, a woman offered to give her 
a Persian, who, like Tiffany, was gray with white paws. 
</P>
<P>
 But Booth wasn't interested. "I called and told her there was only one 
Tiffany."

ROBBINS LOSES REAL ESTATE LICENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite his emotional plea that "I've paid my price," former state Sen. Alan 
Robbins was stripped of his real estate license Friday, five weeks after he 
told an administrative law judge that he had been punished enough as a 
convicted felon. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins, who is scheduled to be released from a Hollywood halfway house next 
week after serving less than two years of his original five-year sentence, 
pleaded guilty in 1992 to political-corruption charges for using his Van Nuys 
Senate seat to extort money from people seeking legislative favors. 
</P>
<P>
 He is awaiting sentencing on a federal bank fraud conviction for failing to 
disclose information in seeking a $900,000 loan from Independence Bank of 
Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 State Real Estate Commissioner Clark Wallace ruled Friday that Robbins' 
license should be revoked because his crimes went to the heart of the issues of 
truthfulness, honesty and moral turpitude, said Dan Garrett, spokesman for the 
state Department of Real Estate. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Robbins' crimes were 
relevant to the qualifications of licensure," Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robbins, saying he will consider an appeal, reiterated Friday that he 
feels he paid his debt to society and deserves a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't seem fair that, after I've paid my price for the things I did that 
were illegal, that I would be punished further by the state Department of Real 
Estate," Robbins said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-year-old former lawmaker said he has already been denied the use of his 
broker's license during the nearly two years he spent in a federal prison in 
Lompoc and the halfway house. 
</P>
<P>
 With no future in politics, no license to practice law and, now, no broker's 
license, Robbins -- who amassed his wealth through real estate deals -- said he 
is uncertain how he will make a living. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's something I'll have to work out," Robbins said. "I suspect there are 
several options that I can go over with my attorney, but I'm not sure what they 
are at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
 In making his case to an administrative law judge Jan. 28, Robbins presented 
numerous letters of support from such political figures as former state Sen. Ed 
Davis and former Assemblyman Tom Bane. 
</P>
<P>
 Other letters testifying to Robbins' character came from UCLA Chancellor 
Charles Young; Charles Fuentes, a former aide to City Atty. James K. Hahn; and 
James Montgomery, a leader in the San Fernando Valley chapter of the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
 But Administrative Law Judge Richard J. Lopez nevertheless recommended that 
Robbins be denied his license, Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was trying to convince the judge he was essentially reformed, with 
character witnesses and all," Garrett said. "But it didn't work. It was a 
pretty straightforward case." 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins, who championed San Fernando Valley issues in the Legislature for 
nearly two decades, can ask for a 30-day stay of Wallace's decision while he 
files an appeal, Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Failing the appeal, Robbins can wait two years and reapply for his license, 
which enables brokers to take part in a range of industrial, commercial and 
residential transactions, Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 500 and 600 brokers lose their licenses in California annually, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins said he regrets Wallace's decision partly because he had planned to 
apply real estate commissions to the approximately $4 million he still owes the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would certainly hope that this action would not be used to keep the 
government out of their money," he said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; BOOSTING MORALE AND ECONOMIC CLIMATE IS GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As Fillmore and Simi Valley struggle to rebuild after the Jan. 17 earthquake, 
business and civic leaders are working to boost the morale of residents and 
improve the economic climate in the two Ventura County cities hit hardest by 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fillmore, the Chamber of Commerce threw its first business mixer Thursday 
and both cities are planning picnic celebrations later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all been through a very hard time and now it's time to let the sunshine 
in and let people know that we're up and running," said Nancy Bender, executive 
director of the Simi Valley Chamber of Commerce. "The picnic will give people a 
chance to have a rip-roarin', story-tellin' time." 
</P>
<P>
 Bender, whose home was severely damaged in the quake, said the chamber is 
helping many of its 780-member businesses fill out emergency loan applications 
or search for new quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank Carrillo executive director of the Fillmore Chamber, said several new 
businesses have joined the organization since the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "People joined because they saw we've been working closely with them, whether 
they're members or not," Carrillo said. "We're getting back to normal and 
that's what we want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 To speed up the process, the city of Fillmore is hiring an architect, a 
structural engineer and an economist to assess damaged buildings and advise 
owners whether they should repair, or demolish the structures and rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 The services, which are expected to cost as much as $115,000, will be paid for 
by the city's redevelopment fund, City Manager Roy Payne said. Total damage to 
Fillmore is estimated at $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Payne said calls from outside developers interested in building in Fillmore 
have surged since the quake. Developers are discovering the city's small-town 
atmosphere, low crime rate and responsive staff, Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an additional awareness of Fillmore," Payne said. "When people get 
here, it really markets itself." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city is planning the first of a series of mini-celebrations for March 19, 
to coincide with the grand opening of trailers and a temporary pavilion erected 
to house businesses displaced by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are going to go through highs and lows," Payne said. "We want when 
things are low to have some kind of high to celebrate in this community." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Simi Valley, building inspectors have nearly completed surveys 
of more than 9,000 quake-damaged structures. Damage is estimated at nearly $350 
million. The Simi Valley City Council has waived permit fees for residents and 
businesses planning to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, the chamber and the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District are 
planning a picnic at Rancho Tapo Park March 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Debi Schultzea park district board member, said she will ask the board to 
waive up to $350 in park and liability fees for the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultze said the picnic would give residents a chance to relax with 
neighbors, many of whom met for the first time after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "People really reached out to help each other after the earthquake, so there 
are a lot of newfound friends out there," Schultze said. "This gives them a 
chance to get together and help each other shake the quake." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some businesses in Simi Valley and Fillmore were forced to move 
because of quake damage and others are limping through sales slumps, business 
owners said they plan to stick it out. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Crockett, whose photography studio in Fillmore's Central Avenue was 
red-tagged, moved his operation into the city-run pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my town. These are the people I service," Crockett said. "It's kind 
of unfair for me to pick up and leave." 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, Darrell Coletto said he is keeping his truck dealership open 
as he applies for funds to help repair the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're recovering slowly," Coletto said. "We're focusing on getting people 
from the west end of the county to shop here, because some of them don't even 
seem to know we've had an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not all businesses are suffering post-quake blues. Building contractors and 
home repair shops are reporting brisk business, and some downtown Fillmore 
merchants said foot traffic has increased since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting more out-of-town people, definitely," said Vanessa McLain, who 
works at a flower shop. "People come because they want to see (the quake 
damage). They say they wish they would've known about it before it all fell 
down."

PANEL OKS METROLINK EXTENSION TO OXNARD; TRANSIT: PLANS CALL FOR THE EMERGENCY 
COMMUTER RAIL SERVICE TO BEGIN MARCH 28. TWO DAILY WEEKDAY ROUND-TRIPS ARE

<P>
 Ventura County transportation officials voted unanimously Friday to extend 
emergency Metrolink service to Oxnard, ending weeks of logistical setbacks and 
financial hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Transportation Commission approved the commuter rail service after 
Executive Director Ginger Gherardi said operating costs could be paid out of 
the $1.9 million set aside to run the emergency Camarillo station that opened 
Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Camarillo station isn't going to cost as much as we expected," Gherardi 
told the commission. "So we have enough to go to Oxnard." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, which is applying for federal emergency money for most of the 
cost of operating the two stations, agreed to spend an additional $215,000, 
that will not be reimbursed, to build a temporary storage terminal for the 
trains that run to Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The county hopes to begin service to Oxnard March 28, said Mary Travis, 
director of transit services for the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard service will be the seventh and final emergency Metrolink stop 
approved in Southern California since the Jan. 17 earthquake. The special 
service is intended to help ease traffic congestion caused by damaged freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily ridership on the 250-mile commuter line has doubled to 18,500 since the 
quake. About 150 passengers board the train in Camarillo each day, Travis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Service to the emergency Metrolink stations is scheduled to continue until 
Oct. 1, when repairs to the Simi Valley Freeway are expected to be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Oxnard line, Metrolink is planning to run two round-trip trains a day 
Mondays through Fridays to the city's transit terminal at 200 E. 4th St. Trains 
will originate in Oxnard, with stops in Camarillo, Moorpark and Simi Valley 
before continuing on to the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket prices have not been set, but Travis said the expected cost would be 
$14 for a round-trip ticket and $208 for a monthly pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Trains will be stored in a temporary layover facility to be built behind a 
citrus packing plant in Montalvo, about 1 1/2 miles from the Oxnard transit 
center. The trains are now kept at the Moorpark station. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's decision marks the end of a struggle by local officials to get 
emergency Metrolink service extended to Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Transportation Commission had applied for Federal Emergency Management 
Agency funding to reimburse the county for 92% of the cost of operating the 
Camarillo station, and had hoped to continue Metrolink service to Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Those plans were stalled when county officials were told it would not be 
possible to get federal reimbursement for the extension. 
</P>
<P>
 The outlook changed several weeks ago when FEMA officials reversed their 
position and told the county that extending the train to Oxnard would qualify 
as emergency relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Transit officials went to work to come up with funding for the project, and 
found that the Camarillo station was much cheaper to operate than the original 
$1.9-million estimate. Gherardi now estimates the cost of running both the 
Camarillo and Oxnard stations will be about $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn, who also serves on the Transportation Commission, 
has worked since the earthquake to get Metrolink extended to Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a giant step forward for transportation for Ventura County," Flynn 
said. "I'm going to call my wife and ask her to get the champagne ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Other commissioners praised the project, but said they were concerned about 
the cost of continuing service after the federal subsidy runs out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in essence approving a train that is purely a trial run," Commissioner 
David Smith said. "It is important that the long-term financing issue be worked 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob McKinney, chairman of the board for South Coast Area Transit, said he was 
worried that Metrolink would end up competing with city bus services for county 
transit dollars. SCAT runs the bus service in Oxnard, Ventura, Port Hueneme and 
Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all warm and fuzzy," McKinney said. "But with this money being spent 
on trains, how is this going to affect the bus service?" 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Vicky Howard, who chairs the commission, defended the plan. "It 
seems like we have an opportunity out of the earthquake to provide very cheaply 
for six or seven months a service," Howard said. "In that time we can get a 
sense of the costs and we can figure out the next step."

NEW PROPOSAL AIMS TO STEM DROPOUT RATE; EDUCATION: OXNARD UNION HIGH SCHOOL 
DISTRICT'S PLAN TO IMPROVE STUDENTS' GRADES TARGETS NINTH-GRADERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to reverse a trend of high failure rates among students, the Oxnard 
Union High School District on Friday announced a sweeping new, get-tough 
proposal to improve academic performance at its six high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Prepared by a team of top district officials and principals, the education 
plan spells out specific responsibilities for teachers, parents, students and 
even community residents in helping the schools to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the plan, which will be considered by trustees Wednesday, focuses on 
enhancing learning among all 12,200 students, it targets ninth-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
 "The success of ninth-graders really determines their success for the other 
three years," said Supt. Bill Studt, who headed the group that devised the new 
strategy. "We want to attack the very beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard school officials have been concerned for years about the poor 
performance of freshmen. In recent years, roughly 25% of Oxnard's ninth-graders 
have flunked their freshmen year. 
</P>
<P>
 To help students improve their grades, the district team is proposing for the 
next school year to put all freshmen who earn less than a C average in the 
first semester on academic probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Students put on this probationary status would be taken out of their regular 
courses and put into small group classes where they would be held to rigorous 
standards of behavior and academic performance. The idea behind the proposal, 
Studt said, is to show ninth-graders that school is serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to establish the environment and the expectation that school is not 
just a place to socialize," Studt said. "This is not fun and games. This is not 
Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to being taken out of the school's regular classes, students on 
academic probation would be restricted from joining sports teams and other 
extracurricular activities. Under the education plan, the district would also 
ask for some changes from teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of allowing many of its best and most experienced teachers to teach 
mainly upper-grade students and honors classes, the district would assign some 
of its top instructors to teach freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Butolph, president of the Oxnard Federation of Teachers, said he doesn't 
believe it will make much of a difference to ask experienced teachers to take 
on freshman classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Many teachers who have honors classes already teach regular courses to 
students in various grades, Butolph said. "We try to move things around. It's 
very boring if you teach the same thing every period." 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Nancy Koch said she had not yet had a chance to examine the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 But Koch said she is pleased at the idea of establishing an academic 
environment that lets students know they are expected to do more than squeak by 
with D averages. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that the majority of kids in high school see the importance of 
what they are learning in high school to their later life," Koch said. "If you 
expect something of kids and let them know what you expect, let them know 
there's consequences and let them know you'll help them meet these goals, I 
think that will help."

DESPITE PROTESTS, VOTE IS URGED TO RESTART ROAD JOB

 Brushing aside protests from Native Americans, county Public Works Department 
officials plan to ask the Ventura County Board of Supervisors to allow 
construction crews to go back to work on a section of Santa Rosa Road outside 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction was interrupted in December after archeologists said they found a 
Chumash cremation chamber and other human remains. About five weeks later, 
archeologists working the site uncovered a series of round, smooth stones that 
may have been involved in some sort of burial ritual. 
</P>
<P>
 Local Native American groups said that based upon preliminary evidence, the 
site could be an ancient Indian cemetery containing the remains of scores of 
deceased who at one time may have called the Santa Rosa Valley area their home. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the discoveries, county officials have generally expressed an 
eagerness to finish the road improvement project. But Native American 
representatives said the road construction should be a secondary concern in 
comparison to the site's "archeological and sacred significance." 
</P>
<P>
 "These people don't know what they are ruining," said Richard Angulo, 
president of the Thousand Oaks-based California Indian Council/Chumash. "This 
area is a sacred place to us and they seem determined to destroy it. Once it's 
gone, you can never replace it." 
</P>
<P>
 W. Butch Britt, the county's deputy director of public works, said that during 
the supervisors meeting on March 15 he will ask the board to endorse the 
following set of findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * That the site does not meet the necessary criteria under state law in order 
to be classified as an "important archeological resource." 
</P>
<P>
 * That the site does not qualify under state law as a Native American 
"sanctified cemetery, place of worship, religious or ceremonial site or sacred 
shrine." 
</P>
<P>
 * Approve the resumption of road construction work at the archeological site 
using the services of a qualified archeologist, Native American monitors and by 
using earth grading machines that will excavate only 1 1/2 inches of soil at a 
single pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Britt, who said archeological work at the site has cost the county more than 
$20,000 so far, said work will be suspended if further grading at the site 
uncovers other remains or artifacts until the items can be removed and 
reinterred according to tribal custom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on what we have discovered there, we think it's time to get back to 
work," Britt said. "If additional remains or artifacts are found we will see 
that they are treated properly and with respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Britt said that because not all of the supervisors are scheduled to attend 
Tuesday's board meeting, county officials decided to hold the item over until 
the March 15 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realize that this is a controversial issue," Britt said. "We wanted all 
the board members in attendance if possible." 
</P>
<P>
 News that the Public Works Department will ask the supervisors to endorse the 
findings infuriated Larry Myer, executive secretary of the California Native 
American Heritage Commission in Sacramento. Myer said the Public Works 
Department's request amounted to a "slap in the face" for all Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very disturbed and saddened to hear that the county wants to resume 
work there," Myer said. "The (archeological) work that's needed there is just 
starting. This isn't something that can be rushed. The county's actions are 
premature." 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on the 11-mile two-lane road initially started in 1990, Britt 
said. The $5 million project is designed to widen and improve safety on the 
two-lane 90-year-old country road. Officials estimate that an estimated 10,000 
commuters use the road daily.

COUNTY TO AGAIN TEST FOR TB AT HIGH SCHOOL; HEALTH: A LA QUINTA SENIOR FOUND TO 
HAVE THE CONTAGIOUS DISEASE IN THE SPRING SUFFERED A RELAPSE. EXAMS WILL BE 
CONDUCTED WEDNESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Public health officials said Friday they are ordering yet another round of 
tuberculosis testing for students and staff at La Quinta High School following 
the discovery that a senior undergoing treatment for the disease had a relapse 
and is contagious. 
</P>
<P>
 Letters were sent home with 146 students who had closest contact with the 
infected girl to obtain parental permission to do the tests, Garden Grove 
Unified School District spokesman Alan Trudell said. Five school staff members 
also will be tested, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Skin tests are scheduled to be administered Wednesday at the Westminster high 
school by public health nurses, officials said, and the results will be known 
Friday. Any students who have positive skin tests will then receive X-rays to 
help determine if they have active TB. 
</P>
<P>
 After a girl in the same grade was found with contagious TB last spring, 225 
of her La Quinta classmates were tested, followed in the fall by a screening of 
the entire 1,332-member student body. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, health officials discovered 16 cases of active TB at La Quinta, 12 of 
which were linked to the initial girl last year. An additional 178 students 
were found infected with the TB bacteria, although they did not have the active 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Public health nurses distribute medications daily at La Quinta to students 
with active TB and two to three times a week to other students who tested 
positive for the bacteria to prevent them from getting sick. Penny Weismuller, 
the county's manager for disease control, said the newly contagious senior had 
been under the care of a private physician since she was discovered to have the 
disease during testing last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-February, the student's doctor discovered that the girl had a relapse 
during a routine sputum test, and after the doctor reported the recurrence to 
the county, she was removed from school, Weismuller said. 
</P>
<P>
 The County Health Care Agency came under criticism from the state and the 
federal Centers for Disease Control for not responding quickly enough to curb 
the initial TB outbreak at La Quinta, in part because the first infected 
student did not receive a rigorous and closely monitored treatment program.  
</P>
<P>
 County health officials have said that because the student took her 
medications erratically, she developed a drug-resistant form of the disease, 
which was passed on to classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 County health officials said, by contrast, the girl who recently suffered a 
relapse had been conscientious about taking her medication, and her treatment 
had been approved by the county. The chances of a relapse occurring under these 
conditions is "very rare," Weismuller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very happy with the actions of the private physician and the student 
has been very responsible, as has been the family," said Dr. Jody Meador, the 
county's interim TB controller.  
</P>
<P>
 Meador said she doubted that the girl was contagious long enough to infect her 
classmates, but that the testing was ordered as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
 Meador said the student was hospitalized Feb. 19 and on Thursday was sent home 
with additional medications. She will be kept home from school until there is 
bacterial evidence that she is no longer contagious, Meador said.  
</P>
<P>
 As an added precaution, the student will take her medication in the presence 
of her physician, Weismuller said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; RACE TAKES BIKE RIDE TO A HIGHER DEGREE

<P>
 Under normal circumstances, a quarter-mile bike race would not be far enough 
for a cyclist to break a sweat, but organizers of this race have taken a whole 
new angle on things. 
</P>
<P>
 Try a 60-degree angle up Cove Road. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, 25 to 40 cyclists are expected to compete in the third annual Dana 
Point Festival of Whales Uphill Bicycle Time Trial, billed as "Orange County's 
most exciting annual hill climb." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a chance for serious, as well as recreational riders, to challenge 
not only others but also nature," race organizer Ed Restante said. 
</P>
<P>
 World-class cyclist Steve Reme of Dana Point has won the race the past two 
years, establishing a record of 52 seconds last year. This year, a new champion 
will be crowned, as Reme will not participate in the race but will help with 
timing of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Restante said that although road racing bikes fair best in the race, 
competitors have raced on mountain bikes and on tandems. "We'll probably issue 
awards for different types of bikes this year," he said. The top three 
finishers in various male and female age groups will be given awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration for the event begins at 6:30 a.m. Sunday. The entry fee is $15 to 
$20. Helmets are mandatory. How Steep It Is Cove Road, the site of Sunday's 
Uphill Bicycle Trial, is touted as having a 60-degree incline. Here are the 
degrees of some other well-known angles: Grapevine: 3,43 degrees (Interstate 5 
northbound, north of Castasic Lake) Lombard Street: 10.3 degrees (San 
Francisco) Splash Mountain: f45 degrees (Disneyland log ride) Boomerange: 45 
degrees (Knott's Berry Farm roller coaster) Sources: Caltrans, City of San 
Francisco, Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm BRIAN RAY BALLOU

 Jim Meredith, a longtime Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District board 
member, said Friday he will become the latest entry in an expanding field of 
candidates seeking Vicky Howard's county supervisorial seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Meredith, 63, said he will formally announce his candidacy Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my record speaks for itself," Meredith said Friday. In addition to 
serving on the park board since 1982, the Simi Valley resident has gotten a 
taste of county government by serving on the county's Park and Harbor 
Commission for 10 years, the county's Beyond 2000 subcommittee and numerous 
other county and city advisory groups. 
</P>
<P>
 While saying he does not want an "ugly" campaign, Meredith lists 
disappointment in the other candidates as his primary motivation to run. 
</P>
<P>
 "The candidates who are running right now, I just didn't think they're the 
type of people I'd want to have represent me as supervisor," he said. "I think 
I'm a people person and I don't think they are. As a county supervisor, you 
have to be compassionate, you have to listen and then you have to respond." 
</P>
<P>
 Other local officials who have said they plan to seek the seat are Simi Valley 
Councilwomen Judy Mikels and Barbara Williamson and Moorpark Councilman Scott 
Montgomery. JAMES MAIELLA JR.

 A Simi Valley realty worker announced Friday that she is running for City 
Council and soon-to-retire Police Chief Lindsey Paul Miller said he is 
seriously considering running. 
</P>
<P>
 Debi Schultze, a loan processor at Aspen Mortgage, said she believes Simi 
Valley needs more affordable rental housing and real estate, new programs to 
help businesses move into the city and grow, and more youth-oriented businesses 
-- goals she intends to work for if elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultze also said she wants to get involved with planning the future of trash 
disposal as Simi Valley runs out of landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to balance all of that, but not compromise our quality of life," said 
Schultze, who for six years has been a member of the Rancho Simi Recreation and 
Park District board.  
</P>
<P>
 The city should still emphasize preserving open space and developing park land 
for the future, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who will soon retire after more than 12 years as police chief, said he 
is testing the waters to see if there is enough voter support to "get serious" 
about running for a council seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, the people I've talked to are enthusiastic about it," he said. "My 
motivation for running is . . . that this council and past councils have always 
had a good focus on law enforcement. That's why we have a safe community. As a 
citizen in the community and not just as a retired law enforcement officer, I 
think it's important that focus be maintained." MACK REED

 The Simi Valley City Council on Monday will consider giving a developer 
$230,000 to help pay for construction and operation of a low-income senior 
housing complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer is also asking the city to modify plans for the complex, 
changing it to cater exclusively to low-income senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Yosemite Gardens is a 108-unit apartment complex planned for construction at 
Yosemite and Los Angeles avenues. Developers originally planned to reserve half 
the units for low-income seniors and rent the rest of the units at market rate. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the request of developer USA Properties Fund, the council will consider 
reserving the entire complex for low-income seniors. USA Properties said it 
would would need the additional funding from the city to help cover the cost of 
housing poor seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, rents for one-bedroom units would range from $365 to $535 a 
month and two-bedroom units would rent for $630 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city agrees to help pay for the project, the funding would come from 
the city's Community Development Agency Affordable/Senior Housing Incentives 
account. SARA CATANIA

 Every school morning at 10:25, teacher Kent Martin opens the window to let the 
birds into his classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Solid white or dappled gray, they flap to the floor, hopping and pecking 
around his pupils' feet. In an instant, they take wing for the door, soaring 
into the sky and circling Trabuco Elementary School's wooded, bucolic campus. 
</P>
<P>
 For four years, the daily lives and flights of Martin's homing pigeons have 
been part of the school's rhythm. Perched in a wood and chicken-wire cage he 
built onto a window, the birds act as companions, teaching tools and links to 
nature for his fourth-grade charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the way I use them is in teaching science," Martin said. "I also 
try to bring them into other things like math -- for calculating mileage and so 
forth." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin also sets the birds loose to fly laps around the school while he and 
his pupils do calisthenics and play games for their physical education class. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pigeons are more than props. They carry on the cycle of life for all 
of Martin's pupils to see: Males and females make nests, offspring are born, 
mothers nurse their chicks, adult birds battle for pecking order and the weak 
die before the strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin's students also learn how to feed, handle and be comfortable with the 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you let the pigeons go, you have to make sure you open the trap door," 
stated 9-year-old Travis Allee. If you don't open that trap door on the outside 
part of the cage, Travis explained, the pigeons can't get back in when they're 
done flying. 
</P>
<P>
 "My favorite part is just watching the kids and how they relate (the birds' 
actions) to human behavior," Martin said. "But, the hardest part is when one 
gets killed or doesn't come back. . . . (The children) have seen them plucked 
out of the air by hawks and eagles. I tell them, 'Well, that's the food chain.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, 30, became interested in homing pigeons when he and his brother raised 
and raced them while growing up in a small, northwest Iowa town. At one time, 
the brothers had 175 birds under their care. 
</P>
<P>
 After his first year of teaching at Trabuco, one of Martin's friends sent him 
four birds from Iowa and, with the permission of the school district, Martin 
was allowed to build the birds a home outside the window. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though they came from Iowa, I think they got acclimated to California 
right away," Martin said. "We had babies in no time." 
</P>
<P>
 If there was any school where the birds would feel at home, it would be 
Trabuco, which maintains stables, pens and coops for horses, ponies, peacocks, 
chickens, geese, ducks, rabbits and a goat. It sits along tree-shaded and 
winding Trabuco Canyon Road and is surrounded by O'Neill Regional Park in the 
quiet hills east of Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin and his pupils have cared for 40 birds over four years. Some have died, 
some have flown away and some Martin has given to or traded with other homing 
pigeon enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the cage outside the window has 13 birds, including two newborn chicks 
nestled in a dog dish filled with straw. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're right there," Martin said as he stood by the window, "in front of all 
the kids' eyes."RICHARD CORE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; WOMAN ACCUSED IN SHOOTINGS ENTERS 
PLEA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 45-year-old woman accused of shooting up a Thousand Oaks neighborhood in a 
drunken rage pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Ann Quinn had previously pleaded not guilty, but entered the 
additional insanity plea so she could be examined by court-appointed doctors, 
Deputy Dist. Atty.Roger A. Inman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn is charged with 19 counts ranging from shooting at inhabited dwellings 
to drunk driving in connection with the Dec. 12 incident. Police said Quinn, a 
messenger-service saleswoman, shot into the buildings -- including a church, 
school and hospital -- because she was upset over the breakup of her marriage. 
No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman said Quinn, who is free on bail, still must face trial on her charges, 
even if the psychologist and psychiatrist appointed to the case Friday conclude 
she is insane. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Scovis, Quinn's attorney, could not be reached for comment. Quinn's jury 
trial is scheduled for April 11 in the courtroom of Ventura County Superior 
Court Judge Lawrence Storch. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; CITY WAIVES TICKETS ON NEW PARKING LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After Moorpark police issued 110 parking tickets during the first week of a 
new city law that makes on-street parking illegal during scheduled street 
sweeping, the City Council decided to disregard the infractions and issued only 
warnings for another week. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to phoned complaints and one resident who angrily brought his 
ticket to Wednesday's council meeting, council members voted 4-0 to waive the 
$30 citations on the tickets already issued and not do any further ticketing 
until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been some people who felt somewhat betrayed," Mayor Paul Lawrason 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The new law bans on-street parking on Tuesdays or Thursdays, depending on the 
regular street-sweeping schedule. Residents should look for signs indicating 
when street sweeping occurs in their area or can call City Hall for more 
information at 529-6864. JAMES MAIELLA JR.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; PARKING PLAN DIVIDES RESIDENTS, BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was residents versus business people as the fight to solve Studio City's 
severe parking problems finally made it to a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 At Thursday night's meeting, arranged by the Los Angeles Department of 
Transportation, neighbors and businesses sparred over whether to set up a 
preferential parking district for the area around Ventura and Laurel Canyon 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan is approved, parking in the neighborhood would be limited to two 
hours unless autos display a residential or guest permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Nadine Antin-Colla, a Studio City resident for the past seven years, supported 
the proposal. "People loiter and litter," Antin-Colla said. "Those of us who 
live on Cantura (Street) feel like we don't have any control." 
</P>
<P>
 Although businesses are important to the area, she said, their employees and 
customers crowd residential streets close to the boulevard, making it 
impossible for residents to park near their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harold Ginsburg, owner of Art's Deli on Ventura Boulevard, told the crowd 
at Carpenter Avenue Elementary School that the city should be responsible for 
supplying parking for employees and should not try to pit the groups against 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is making us take the position that it is the merchants against the 
residents," Ginsburg said. "They want us to fight it out." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed boundaries for the district are Ventura Boulevard to the north, 
Viewcrest Road to the south, Laurel Terrace Drive to the west and Laurel Canyon 
Boulevard to the east. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council approval is needed and 67% of residents must sign the petition 
for a parking district to be established. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan is adopted, residents could renew their permits every 90 days, 
purchase six-month visitor passes for $10 to be used on their block only or 
guest permits for $1 a day to be used anywhere in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers could also purchase guest permits to shop along the boulevard and 
employees could use them for parking all day on residential streets. Business 
owners, however, may not purchase the residential permits unless they live in 
the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the disadvantages (of the parking district) is that you are not 
guaranteed a parking space in front of your own home. Your neighbor can park 
there too," Rafael R. Prepena, a transportation engineer, warned the crowd of 
75. "But the advantage is you know who is parking on your street and you are 
able to preserve the integrity of your neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 The public can park for two hours in the district without a permit, but after 
two hours they will be issued a $30 parking ticket. "This is to discourage 
businesses from sending their employees into the neighborhood to park all day," 
Prepena said. JEANNETTE REGALADO

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; ANGEL FLIGHT PILOTS PROVIDE A NEEDED LIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An updraft from the mountains gently rocked the aircraft as John Shroyer sat 
with his hand on his stomach, holding in place the feeding tube that had 
started to slip earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "John, are you OK with this turbulence?" asked David Salo, a pilot for Angel 
Flight, a volunteer organization of pilots who offer their time, money and 
aircraft to fly patients to medical appointments. This flight -- with Salo as 
co-pilot and fellow volunteer Kendall Hales as pilot -- originated at Burbank 
Airport, and will take Shroyer from the City of Hope National Medical Center in 
El Monte to his home near Modesto. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it," said Shroyer, 54, who only recently has begun to hope that he had 
beaten the cancer which had destroyed most of his lower jaw. "It's fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Shroyer has flown with Angel Flight at least two dozen times since July, 1992, 
so often that he can pick out the landmarks from 8,000 feet on the trip from 
home to the City of Hope, where he has gone for his cancer treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had the money to take lessons and get a pilot's license, I would love to 
do what they do for others," Shroyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shroyer, diagnosed with bone cancer in 1984, had to rent a car and have his 
brother drive him down for his surgery before he discovered Angel Flight. 
</P>
<P>
 His brother later died, leaving Shroyer with no way to get to his appointments 
without the volunteer pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 Salo and Hales, both from La Crescenta, joined Angel Flight a year ago, taking 
about one mission a month with the 1966 Beechcraft Debonair owned by Hales' 
father. Angel Flight is based in Santa Monica, but a quarter of its 450 pilots 
are from the San Fernando Valley, flying out of Van Nuys and Burbank airports. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've made some pretty good friends, and some of them have flown me only 
once," said Shroyer, who often flies down with his 14-year-daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't for my daughter I wouldn't have done this well," said Shroyer. A 
few years ago, he said, he asked his doctors "if they could guarantee me I 
would live seven years to see my daughter turn 18. They said they couldn't 
guarantee me seven days." 
</P>
<P>
 He lost most of his lower jaw in operations to remove the cancer and Shroyer, 
who has a penchant for Cajun cooking, has not eaten a meal in almost four 
years, instead taking his nourishment through the tube in his stomach. The 
cancer has not returned in three years, and in a series of operations, doctors 
have been slowly reconstructing his mouth so that he might be able to swallow 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 On his next Angel Flight, Shroyer expects to learn if he will be able to start 
eating baby food. He's hoping that his cancer will stay in remission, and this 
flight for treatment will be his last. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way back to Modesto, the plane flew past Lemoore Naval Air Station, and 
Shroyer watched as an F-18 Hornet took off and spun away from him like a dart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd give anything to be able to take off in one of those, just once," he 
said. ED BOND

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; STUDENTS HONOR 5 KEY WOMEN FROM 
HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDA DAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 23 girls at Banyan Elementary School in Thousand Oaks, the experience of 
playing dress-up and pretend will be meaningful as well as fun next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls, like others in Thousand Oaks elementary schools throughout the 
week, will be acting out the roles of five important women in history as part 
of the Women's History Project sponsored by the American Assn. of University 
Women. 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Lewis, the project's co-chairwoman, said she was pleasantly surprised to 
find that the girls didn't sign up to perform monologues in front of classmates 
just so they could wear frilly costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were saying, 'I want to be an attorney when I grow up, so I want to be 
Vilma Martinez,' " Lewis said, referring to one of this year's subjects, a 
Latina activist lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The AAUW started the project eight years ago to make students aware of the 
often-overlooked accomplishments of women in history, Lewis said. The 
association researches and writes monologues about five different women each 
year and distributes them to Thousand Oaks schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica Arsenian, 11, said she wanted to play Ida B. Wells-Barnett, a 
slave-turned journalist in the late 19th Century, to raise awareness about 
women's accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 "In history books, you don't see women or any history about women," the 
sixth-grader said. "I think people should know about it, so I decided to teach 
them about it." 
</P>
<P>
 At some Thousand Oaks elementary schools next week, adult volunteers will 
enact the women's lives in the monologues, which last several minutes. But 
Banyan Principal George Coyle said he liked the idea of involving students in 
the project beyond just watching. 
</P>
<P>
 After a dress rehearsal this week, Coyle told the girls, "When you walk into 
those classrooms, you're going to be teaching other kids about women in history 
they may never read about and may never hear about otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Paullus, whose daughter will portray turn-of-the-century architect Julia 
Morgan, said the project provides a valuable new perspective on history for 
youngsters -- and even adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm embarrassed to admit I hadn't heard of most of these women and I 
considered myself fairly educated," Paullus said after watching the dress 
rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
 Other women who will be portrayed in the project this year are physicist 
Chien-Shiung Wu, the first woman to teach at Princeton, in the 1930s, and Susan 
Butcher, who has won the Alaskan Iditarod dog sled race four times. BRENDA DAY

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; $35,000 IN CLASSROOM EQUIPMENT STOLEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police are investigating the theft of nearly $35,000 of electronic equipment 
from a classroom at the North Hollywood High School's magnet center at the Los 
Angeles Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 The break-in targeted one of the Animal Studies/Biological Sciences Magnet 
Center's bungalow classrooms located in the zoo parking lot. A teacher, who 
discovered Thursday morning that computers, printers, television sets, video 
cassette recorders and laser disk players were missing from his room, said the 
theft appeared to be an inside job. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew exactly what they were looking for," said science and computer 
teacher Barry Shapiro. "They only hit my room." 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles Unified School 
District police are investigating the theft, but do not have any suspects. 
Catherine Lum, principal of North Hollywood High, said the school's dean of 
students plans to ask the magnet students Monday about the theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro said years of accumulated material and computer programs were lost in 
the break-in, because every disk in the room, including "backups of backups" 
was stolen. He said he is concerned about finishing the semester. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you teach a computer class without computers?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The thieves entered through a hole they cut in a wall of the three-room 
bungalow and carefully removed the equipment, much of which was bolted to carts 
or tables. 
</P>
<P>
 The Magnet program, which is affiliated with North Hollywood High School, was 
created in 1981. The 280 students in the program come from all over Los Angeles 
and take shuttles to the North Hollywood campus for other classes, lunch and 
sports activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Lum said because the district does not reimburse such losses, the school is 
hoping for private donations to replace the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took years to accumulate all this," Lum said. "To have it all wiped out in 
one moment is really devastating." SUSAN BYRNES

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; KATZ SEEKS STATE INPUT ON PIPELINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) has asked the State Fire Marshal's Office 
whether it is within the state's power to require an oil company to remove a 
controversial pipeline from beneath a school playground in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter dated Friday to Nancy Wolfe, chief of the marshal's Pipeline 
Safety Division, Katz also implored the agency to "adhere to standards 
exceeding the minimum required by law" when it subjects the earthquake-damaged 
Four Corners Pipeline to tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The pipeline broke in eight places during the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, 
including a fracture that fueled a large fire beside San Fernando's O'Melveny 
Elementary School. Since the spill, public officials have demanded that a 
segment of the pipeline beneath the school's playground be relocated, and 
others have demanded it be shut down permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials have been stymied by questions of which government entities have 
jurisdiction over the line, which stretches 130 miles from Kern County to 
refineries in the South Bay. Both the city of Los Angeles and San Fernando have 
franchise agreements with the pipeline company, but neither is certain it has 
the power to stop the flow of oil or demand that the line be moved.  
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent this week to the city of San Fernando, Wolfe reminded 
officials that federal and state law give her office exclusive jurisdiction 
over safe operation of oil pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe said Friday she was unsure if those responsibilities gave her office 
power to move the line. "This is one of those things that fall into a gray area 
and we would have to investigate the matter," she said. "The regulations and 
the law aren't specific in this area." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said that he wants the pipe moved from the schoolyard "at a minimum" and 
was willing to try to find a safer place for the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got to go somewhere -- it won't just disappear," Katz said in an 
interview. "We at least have to make sure it's as safe as it possibly can be." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a San Fernando City Council member also is drafting a proposal 
asking the State Fire Marshal's Office to tighten its scrutiny of the line. 
Councilman Doude Wysbeek said Friday he expects to present his proposal during 
the council's 7 p.m. meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more concerned with the whole system of testing, and that after an 
accident occurs, (whether) they're not willing to go the extra mile for the 
public," Wysbeek said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Marshal's Office has promised to require a series of tests before 
ruling on the safety of the pipeline after repairs are made, and will order the 
owner to enact a program to replace aging pipes joined by archaic welds no 
longer considered up to modern industry standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the company, which is a subsidiary of Arco, have said they 
are willing to move the line from the schoolyard and will cooperate with the 
Fire Marshal's Office. GEOFFREY MOHAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; CITY OKS $188,700 DEAL TO REPAIR PIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long-awaited repairs to the fire-damaged Seal Beach Pier are expected to begin 
next month, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council this week awarded a $188,700 contract to Pacific 
Enterprises/Cox Construction to replace several large wood pilings that were 
burned in a May, 1992, fire which charred a 75-foot section of the pier and 
damaged a lifeguard station. 
</P>
<P>
 The work is to begin in late April and continue for about two months, said 
City Manager Jerry L. Bankston. 
</P>
<P>
 The pier will be closed to the public for about seven days during that period. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and local merchants hope the repairs are completed before 
summer beach crowds begin converging on the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was covered by insurance, but the city must pay a $100,000 deductible 
on its claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Enterprises/Cox Construction was selected after a bidding process that 
took several months. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to making quake repairs, the firm will repair some wood pilings 
that were damaged during the 1992 Landers earthquake.SHELBY GRAD

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; PRINCIPAL REMOVED FROM HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Burbank High School Principal Keiko Hentell, who was to have been demoted to 
English teacher with the end of her contract in July, has been removed from 
office effective Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was made Thursday afternoon "for the best interests of the school 
district," said Supt. Arthur Pierce without further explanation. Caroline 
Brumm, the principal at Burbank's Edison Elementary School, has been named 
interim principal. 
</P>
<P>
 The news of Hentell's removal punctuated an already emotionally charged 
Burbank School District Board of Education meeting Thursday night, in which the 
principal's supporters packed the meeting room to demand her reinstatement and 
a handful of teachers quietly applauded the board action to remove Hentell 
after her 2 1/2-year-term at Burbank High. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers who opposed Hentell criticized her management techniques. But 
supporters praised Hentell for her concerns about minority students at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 58 speakers addressed the board Thursday night. Nearly 100 packed the 
City Council chambers and as many as 50 more watched the meeting on television 
in two other rooms at Burbank City Hall, where the session was held. Speakers 
presented petitions of support signed by 90 Burbank High employees and 300 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "She will not leave Burbank defeated," Burbank resident Ted McConkey said. 
"She has the respect of her colleagues, the support of her friends, and most of 
all, the love of her students and because of this she is a success." 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of the session, Hentell read a four-page statement that she was 
not asking for her job back, but wanted to "defend my greatest asset, my 
reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 When she came to Burbank High in 1991, the school was 37% Latino, but only a 
small percentage of those students were in advanced classes. She said she 
supported the school's Latino club and Young Black Scholars to give those 
students a sense of belonging. 
</P>
<P>
 She criticized the board for not being responsive to the needs of all parents 
and students and representing only a small segment of the community, despite a 
stated philosophy that emphasizes a philosophy of equal education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only surmise that the real reason I have been relieved of my position 
is that I took your own philosophy too seriously," Hentell said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, board members would only reaffirm that she was not being removed 
because of her support for ethnic groups at the school and did not offer any 
further explanation, except to say that the decision was made after a long 
evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a racial issue," board member Robert Dunivant said. ED BOND

<P>
 The annual Community Fair -- the first of many events in a six-week 
celebration of the return of the swallows -- will take place today at Cook 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Many attractions will be featured: food, crafts and game booths, strolling 
entertainers, exhibits and music. 
</P>
<P>
 But like many Fiesta de las Golondrinas events, the fair will have an Old West 
element with its amateur Western dance contest. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's competition will allow children to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, there will be pony rides, a petting zoo, train rides and face painting. 
Mimes and animal characters will be roaming the grounds in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair will last from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Cook Park is on Calle Arroyo between 
La Novia and Rancho Viejo Road. Admission and parking are free, but there will 
be a small charge for some rides. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Community Fair is a great value with entertainment and activities for the 
entire family," said Al King, city director of community services. "I encourage 
everyone to drop by and enjoy the warm hospitality of San Juan Capistrano." 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Housing Bank, a nonprofit earthquake relief project, is 
compiling a list of vacant rental properties to provide to victims of the Jan. 
17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank is asking for information about vacancies in the greater metropolitan 
area surrounding Los Angeles, including Ventura, Orange, San Bernardino and 
Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a win-win situation," said Rosie De La Cruz, interagency liaison for 
the Information and Referral Foundation of Los Angeles, which is sponsoring the 
housing bank. "Property owners can list for free and displaced families can get 
the list for free. We're trying to be a clearinghouse."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; COUNTY TO CONSIDER GRANT PROPOSALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday will consider giving grants to eight 
community groups offering social services such as job placement, emergency 
shelters and volunteer advocates for abused children. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant proposals, which seek sums of $1,000 to $5,000, are for money from 
the county's Social Programs fund, which is used to subsidize nonprofit groups. 
The groups being considered are: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Boys and Girls Club of Tustin, which is requesting $1,000 for its 
endowment fund. Club membership has increased 50% in the past year, jumping to 
1,735, and the money would be used to help pay for a variety of activities, 
such as computer assisted education, a program for latchkey kids and a military 
outreach effort. 
</P>
<P>
 * Family Solutions of Orange, which is requesting $1,000 to support its 
services for physically and sexually abused children. Family Solutions operates 
13 group care and 10 foster care programs that strive to reunite families when 
feasible and to provide a substitute family support system. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Friends of the Court Appointed Advocates, a group that supports advocacy 
programs for abused, abandoned and neglected children, is requesting $5,000. 
The group, based in Orange, focuses on children who need community trained 
volunteers to speak on their behalf during investigations and court 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Homeless Intervention and Shelter House in Placentia is requesting 
$1,000 to assist its shelter program for families. The agency provides 
temporary shelter to homeless families and provides counseling to help them 
find permanent quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Orange County Chapter of the National Center for Missing and Exploited 
Children is requesting $2,500 to support its efforts to help the families of 
missing children and to aid in the agency's community crime prevention and 
education ventures aimed at curbing the victimization of youngsters. The group 
is based in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Orange Coast Interfaith Shelter of Costa Mesa is requesting $1,500 to 
cover operational expenses. The program provides emergency shelter to homeless 
families and also food, clothing, counseling, tutoring and health-care 
referrals. The shelter last year provided 28,000 bed-nights and 75,000 meals to 
more than 1,600 homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 * Paint Your Heart Out Anaheim is requesting $1,000 to assist its continuing 
efforts to help residents of homes in disrepair. The money would help provide 
materials for the hundreds of volunteers who participate in painting and 
repairing properties of low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Youth Employment Services of the Harbor Area is requesting $1,000 to help 
with its job education efforts. The Costa Mesa-based program teaches youths 
between ages 14 and 22 how to develop their talents and how to seek and 
interview for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Meetings of the Board of Supervisors are public and include a segment inviting 
input from residents. The board meets Tuesdays at 9:30 a.m. in the Board 
Hearing Room, on the first floor of the Hall of Administration, 10 Civic Center 
Plaza in Santa Ana. For more information about agenda items or meetings, call 
(714) 834-3100.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; BOARD VOTES TO CLOSE 2 SCHOOLS NEXT FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During an emotional, sometimes even tearful, public hearing Thursday, the 
Westminster School District board voted to close two elementary schools when 
Neomia B. Willmore Elementary School reopens next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted unanimously to close Virginia K. Boos Elementary and voted 3 
to 2 to close James W. Franklin Elementary. Trustees Ron Morgan, Sheryl 
Neugebauer and Nancy Blumenthal approved the second closure. Trustees Margie 
Rice and Kathy Stirling Iverson opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 With the decisions, the board effectively endorsed Supt. Gail Wickstrom's 
proposal to optimize enrollment and spending in the southwest portion of the 
district once Willmore reopens in September. Wickstrom has said that the 
district would save about $250,000 a year with that plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you'll notice tonight that all our voices are shaking because this is 
not an easy decision to make," Blumenthal told the audience after making the 
motion to close Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were elected to do what is best for all students" within the district, not 
only the ones who would be forced to attend a new school, Neugebauer said. "For 
that reason, I'm going to support the superintendent's recommendation." 
</P>
<P>
 The board approved the school closures as well as several school boundary 
changes. About 900 students will attend new schools this fall under the new 
plan, which is designed to make the most efficient use of school space. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, elementary schools should accommodate between 500 and 650 students. 
Most schools districtwide will maintain student populations within that range 
for several years, Wickstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiping away tears, Iverson described the anguish the board suffered while 
considering the school closures. She said she identified with parents, noting 
that her children's neighborhood school was closed last year. 
</P>
<P>
 She added that "this is a money issue. If we spend money to keep sites open, 
we do not have money to spend elsewhere" on books and classroom materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents denounced the decision to close the campuses. They said it would 
force their children to travel farther and deprive their neighborhood of a 
neighborhood school. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new boundary changes, most students who now attend Boos will go to 
Frank N. Eastwood Elementary, although those who live northeast of the San 
Diego Freeway will be bused to Ada E. Clegg Elementary School. Franklin 
students living west of Springdale will be bused to C. Fred Schroeder 
Elementary School and those living east of that street will go to Clegg, 
district spokeswoman Audrey Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Willmore opens, about 550 students who live nearby will be able to walk 
to that campus and will no longer be bused out of the neighborhood to other 
schools.JON NALICK

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CAMARILLO; KNOWLEDGE BOWL BEGINS COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Students from 10 Ventura County high schools squared off against each other 
this week in the annual Knowledge Bowl competition that is modeled after the 
"Jeopardy!" TV gameshow. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Camarillo branch of the American Assn. of University Women, 
the Knowledge Bowl held its first meet of the year Wednesday at Camarillo High 
School and will have two more competitions this month.Buena High School in 
Ventura and Rio Mesa High in Camarillo were tied for first place after the 
initial competition. 
</P>
<P>
 As on "Jeopardy!," students in the Knowledge Bowl compete to answer questions 
on a wide range of topics, hitting buzzers to signal when they think they have 
the correct responses. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is one difference: Knowledge Bowl participants are not allowed to 
choose the topics of the questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the AAUW members who moderate the event fire off questions randomly 
from six subject areas: math, English, history, current events, geography and, 
to a lesser extent, sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Other schools participating in this year's bowl are St. Bonaventure High 
School and Ventura High in Ventura; Oxnard High, Hueneme High and Channel 
Islands High in Oxnard; Camarillo High in Camarillo; Santa Paula High School in 
Santa Paula, and Simi Valley High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's Knowledge Bowl champion was Buena High, which has won the contest 
in 12 of the 14 years it has been held. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knowledge Bowl will have its next meet at 7 p.m. Wednesday at Channel 
Islands High School and its final competition of the year on March 16 at Buena 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning team will get to take back to its school the Knowledge Bowl 
trophy. Each member of the winning team will get a prize, such as an atlas or 
thesaurus. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS; BERLINERS GIVE $470,000 TO AID L.A. SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Representatives from Berlin, Germany, visited quake-scarred Kennedy High 
School in Granada Hills on Friday to present a donation of $470,000 collected 
from Berlin residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The donation, one of the largest for school relief since the Jan. 17 quake, 
was given to the nonprofit Los Angeles Education Partnership. The partnership 
has distributed the money to 20 Los Angeles Unified schools, including Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will be used to replace instructional materials and equipment 
destroyed in the quake, said partnership spokesman Kevin Ota. 
</P>
<P>
 German officials said that gratitude for U.S. aid to Berlin after World War 
II, as well as a flood of television and radio advertisements, helped prompt 
hundreds of Berlin residents to send checks to aid the Los Angeles recovery 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were lots of small donations. That's the emotional and impressive thing 
about this -- many people gave just $10 or $15," said Stefan Schlueter, deputy 
counsel general for Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlin and Los Angeles have a 27-year-old sister city relationship, Schlueter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the money had already been transferred electronically, Berlin 
journalist Juergen Graf, who helped organize the fund-raising effort on behalf 
of Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen, awarded a symbolic check to partnership 
officials during a ceremony at Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 The presentation was made before a crowd that included school officials, many 
Kennedy students and representatives for Mayor Richard Riordan and school board 
member Julie Korenstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, students loitered amid the rubble on their lunch breaks or headed to 
class in one of the 60 portable buildings that have replaced permanent 
structures on the Kennedy campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Kendricks, principal of Crescent Heights Elementary in Los Angeles, was 
present to receive her school's portion of the donation -- $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The school lost six classroom computers and a host of other tools and 
materials in the quake, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This makes a big difference to us," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 The money the school received in state aid was not even enough to replace one 
computer, she added. JILL LEOVY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MALL SHOP TO OFFER PERMITS, INFORMATION 
</P>

<P>
 City officials will staff a shop at Buenaventura Mall today to issue permits 
for minor home improvements and distribute information about earthquake 
retrofitting for foundations of older homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In an empty storefront next to Mrs. Fields Cookies, city officials will issue 
on-the-spot building permits for minor electrical, mechanical and plumbing 
work.Permits, which cost $20 to $50, would also be available for patio covers, 
simple decks and fencing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time we've ever issued permits away from City Hall," said Bob 
Prodoehl, superintendent of building and safety. "It's kind of a trial to 
improve our image. If we're out of City Hall, people might be a little 
receptive and a little more likely to come up to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Prodoehl said officials will also be promoting the need for upgrading homes 
built before World War II. City staff members estimate that nearly 400 homes in 
the city -- primarily in the mid-town and Ventura Avenue areas -- are not 
anchored to their concrete foundations and could be jolted off the foundations 
in a severe earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would love to have people upgrade those buildings," Prodoehl said. "It 
would cost a couple thousand to do it, and it could cost $20,000 if the house 
fell off the foundation." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials will offer free inspections to homeowners to determine if an 
upgrade is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The shop will be open from noon to 6 p.m. today. Other sessions are scheduled 
at the Ventura Home Show at the Ventura County Fairgrounds the March 19-20 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether we keep doing it will depend on how many people take advantage of the 
service," Prodoehl said. PEGGY Y. LEE

BUS FIRM CHOSEN FOR TRIAL PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bus company has been selected to operate a new countywide bus service 
scheduled to start this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Transportation Commission on Friday approved a contract 
with Antelope Valley Transportation to operate buses in the federally funded 
trial bus program. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, called Ventura Intercity Service Transit Authority, or VISTA, is 
scheduled to start in July and run for up to two years. VISTA, designed as a 
commuter bus service to link Ventura County's 10 cities, is funded with $1.2 
million in federal and local funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Routes have not been mapped out, but the air-conditioned, coach-style buses 
are expected to make one or two stops in each city. SARA CATANIA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; COUNCIL POSTPONES CABLE RATE HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A public hearing on recent cable rate adjustments was indefinitely postponed 
this week by the Yorba Linda City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager David Gruchow said the city is waiting until the 
Federal Communications Commission issues its final ruling on what cities can 
regulate in their franchise agreements with cable operators. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a general sense of what the FCC's ruling will be but there has been 
no final ruling yet," Gruchow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, cities are limited to regulating what residents pay for basic cable 
service, based on a complicated formula established by the FCC. But the FCC 
could broaden its regulations to include how service is offered, for instance, 
allowing cities to regulate the practice of grouping channels into tiers that 
subscribers must pay for separately. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FCC has said they would possibly look at (allowing cities to regulate) 
tiering," Gruchow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gruchow said the rates set by the city's cable operator, Jones-Spacelink, are 
slightly below the benchmark established by the FCC and that the company has 
been generally responsive to citizen complaints. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; ENDOWMENT FUND HELPS DEFRAY COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The city has established an endowment fund to defray maintenance costs for the 
new Community Center and to purchase additional equipment for the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The first donation will come from the county, which pledged $10,000 to the 
city at the grand opening of the $6-million building on Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's use that (donation) to start the endowment fund," said Councilman Henry 
W. Wedaa at a City Council meeting this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The pledge came from Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, and although the county has 
not yet delivered the check, the council has already designated how the money 
will be spent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been told there is no facility in or around Yorba Linda suitable for 
recital performances by pianists," said Councilman Daniel T. Welch, who 
proposed that the first expenditure from the endowment be a baby grand piano. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the center has several rooms that can be used for dance and music 
recitals, the building does not have a piano. The rest of the council supported 
Welch's suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 The endowment fund will operate similarly to the city's Library Gift Fund, 
which is used to buy artwork, exhibits and other materials. 
</P>
<P>
 People who donate $100 or more to the library fund will have their name 
engraved on a wall plaque at the library, and those who contribute to the 
community center will be recognized in a similar manner. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; PUPILS FIND COLLEGE TOUR EDUCATIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tim Sherman, 11, never really considered the idea of going to college before 
Thursday for one simple reason: "I thought it was going to be boring." 
</P>
<P>
 But now, after touring the campus of Cal State Fullerton with his sixth-grade 
class, Tim is excited about continuing his education after high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just really love it. I'm going to come back here soon with my parents. I 
just hope that someday I can come here," the sixth-grader said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim was among about 75 students from Earl Warren Elementary School in Garden 
Grove who toured the campus this week. The 2 1/2-hour tour was intended to get 
children thinking about, and possibly planning for, college long before they 
might have otherwise considered it, said Lisa Evers, program facilitator for 
special education at Garden Grove Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to get them in early. A lot of times when they get to high school 
or junior high, they already have their minds made up about whether they want 
to go to college or whether they can go," Evers said. 
</P>
<P>
 During their visit, the youths and about 20 parents walked through the 
computer building, classrooms, athletic fields and tree-lined courtyards. For 
the children, highlights of the trip included the recreation rooms, complete 
with bowling alleys, pool tables and video games. 
</P>
<P>
 "In college, you'll notice that there's no school bell," said tour guide Steve 
Fu, 20, a student at the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's because all the students know when they're supposed to be at their 
classes," Fu said. "No one tells them what to do, and if you miss a class, no 
one calls you at home." 
</P>
<P>
 The news that going to class is not always required prompted several students 
to cry out, "No way!" and one girl's mouth dropped open as she stared in silent 
disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 During the tour, the pupils were also surprised to learn that college students 
can determine their own schedules and that they do not all take the same 
classes. Several six-graders commented that college is not what they expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought college was just one building," said April Van Deldon, 11. "I had 
no idea it was going to be this big." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelica Almodovar, 12, said she wanted to study ecology at the college 
someday. "I think the whole school is cool and I want to come here when I grow 
up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She appreciated the tour and said that it made her feel excited about learning 
and maintaining good grades. She added: "I was planning to go to college 
already, but I didn't know it was going to be fun."JON NALICK

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: LIBRARY BOOKMOBILE SERVICE EXPANDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Public Library is expanding its bookmobile service to the San 
Fernando Valley until more of the 12 earthquake-damaged libraries can be 
reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been augmenting our normal stops so we can at least attempt to provide 
service," said Robert Reagan, libraries spokesman."It's a stopgap until we can 
get these buildings reopened." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to their normal routes, the bookmobiles will stop at the Granada 
Hills Branch parking lot on Petit Avenue and the West Valley Regional Branch 
Library parking lot on Vanowen Street on Saturdays from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Bookmobiles that normally stop at the Nordhoff-Woodley community and 
Fallbrook-Victory community will increase their Monday hours to 10:30 a.m. to 4 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional stops are planned for San Fernando Gardens, West Van Nuys and 
Canyon Plaza Shopping Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Two more branches -- Sherman Oaks and Canoga Park -- are expected to reopen 
March 14, Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who checked out materials from branches closed after the Northridge 
earthquake is asked to keep the items until the branch reopens. No fines will 
be charged. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about branch closures, call (213) 228-7104. REBECCA

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: STUDENTS TO MEET AT SUMMIT ON VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students from three San Fernando Valley high schools will join representatives 
from 23 other Los Angeles County schools at a two-day summit next week to 
identify ways to reduce teen-age violence on and off campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Los Angeles County Office of Education and the alcohol 
prevention program Friday Night Live, the "Harmony Summit" will be held Tuesday 
and Wednesday in Malibu. Students from Reseda and Van Nuys high schools and 
Evergreen Continuation High School will be among the estimated 90 participants. 
</P>
<P>
 The summit marks the first time that the decade-old organization, Friday Night 
Live, will focus on violence prevention in a formal fashion. Founded in 1984 in 
three counties to address the growing problem of drinking and driving among 
teen-agers, Friday Night Live -- now in more than 50 counties -- has widened 
its focus over the years, first to include drugs and now violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that violence has gotten out of hand," said John Berndt project 
director of Friday Night Live. "And violence is often an issue that results 
from lessened inhibitions that occur when a kid is loaded."  
</P>
<P>
 Summit organizers hope that through discussion, the students will come up with 
concrete ideas and activities they can bring back to their campuses to help 
reduce violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday Night Live has chapters in about 150 high schools and junior highs in 
Los Angeles County. Organizers for the summit chose some of the participating 
schools for geographical representation and others -- such as Reseda where a 
student was shot and killed last year -- because they had experienced violence. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Castillo Luz, 16, president of Reseda High School's chapter of Friday Night 
Live, said discussing violence as part of the program's focus is a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all connected," he said. "Once you get your hands on things you're not 
supposed to have, you get pretty violent." SUSAN BYRNES

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; BOYS & GIRLS CLUB CLOSER TO REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed new Boys & Girls Club in Woodland Hills is a step closer to 
becoming reality thanks to the approval of a merger with the San Fernando 
Valley Boys & Girls Club of Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Gross, a board member of the new club, said Friday that the group will 
launch its first major fund-raiser today and may be ready to open a club in 
modular buildings at the site of Serrania Avenue School by early this summer.  
</P>
<P>
 The idea of opening a nonprofit Boys & Girls Club in the West Valley, which 
would provide recreation for children, has been several years in the making, 
Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
 It could have been several years more, but last month the boards of directors 
of the existing San Fernando Valley facility and the proposed West Valley 
facility agreed to merge, Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger will allow the two clubs to share expertise, an executive director 
and some administrative services, thus cutting costs and expanding the support 
base for the club, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The formation of the new West Valley Unit of the Boys & Girls Club will be 
formally announced later this spring, said West Valley board President Brad 
Rosenheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the West Valley branch have already raised about $40,000 toward 
the $120,000 cost of operating a new club for the first year, Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of that money has come from corporate donations, he said. Today, at 10:30 
a.m. at Fallbrook Mall, the organization will launch its first major push to 
collect individual donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross said supporters want to raise between $10,000 and $15,000 for the new 
club by raffling off a 9-foot-high wooden Victorian playhouse donated by the 
Assn. of Women in Construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The playhouse will be unveiled at the mall today. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross said the idea of opening a Boys & Girls Club in the West Valley began in 
1989 because latch-key children in the area needed someplace to go. 
</P>
<P>
 A Boys & Girls Club can "reach children before they get into gangs," said 
Rosenheim. "This will provide a place for young people to go after school."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; FATE OF HISTORIC MARKET TO BE DECIDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After years of trying to decide what to do with the historic Peirano grocery 
store, a 117-year-old historical landmark across from San Buenaventura Mission, 
the Ventura City Council on Monday is scheduled to settle the fate of the 
city-owned building. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will decide between two proposals from developers that call for 
either seismically upgrading the building or razing the structure, which is 
boarded-up and vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Realty wants to buy the Peirano building from the city and demolish it 
to show off a tile-lined pool underneath that might have been used by Spanish 
missionaries as a laundry. A facade of the Peirano building would be built, and 
the laundry would be the main focus of a courtyard surrounded by a restaurant, 
shops and offices. 
</P>
<P>
 JKL & M Associates, based in Oxnard, proposes to rent the Peirano building to 
retail stores or a restaurant and would lease the adjoining Wilson Studio space 
for a municipal art gallery. The laundry would be highlighted in the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Artists' Union, a group of local artists, had proposed to rent the 
Peirano building from the city for an art gallery, but the group withdrew its 
proposal Thursday and decided to back JKL & M Associates instead. 
</P>
<P>
 A subcommittee of the City Council has thrown its support behind Ventura 
Realty's proposal, largely because city leaders are reluctant to spend $430,000 
in seismic repairs for the old brick grocery store. The city has been 
unsuccessful in leasing the building since 1987 because of the high costs to 
make it meet earthquake safety codes. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; VOTE ON BIKE PATH PROJECT IS DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with homeowners worried that a two-mile bike path might bring vandalism, 
graffiti and violence to their back yards, Fillmore City Council members and 
parks commissioners have postponed a vote on the project and ordered staff to 
prepare an environmental report. 
</P>
<P>
 "As most of us know, Fillmore isn't immune to the crime that spills in from 
the Los Angeles Basin," resident Laura Grady said."Since we seem to be unable 
to handle the current problem, I don't think we should invite in more violence, 
graffiti and garbage." 
</P>
<P>
 Creation of the bike path would mean paving a gravel access road that flood 
control officials use to maintain the Sespe Creek levee. The path would run 
along Sespe Creek from where it crosses under California 126 near E Street to 
where it runs near 6th Street, north of Old Telegraph Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to nearly three hours of residents' testimony, council members also 
rejected two parking lots planned for residential neighborhoods, ordered that 
the path end at 6th Street rather than Goodenough Road as originally planned 
and asked for increased fencing around the path. 
</P>
<P>
 The city received $116,000 in state gas-tax funds to construct the bike path. 
The environmental impact report, which will focus on how path users might 
affect the surrounding ecosystem, will add another $5,000 to that cost, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, fences that City Council members and commissioners asked for 
Monday night could tack another $40,000 to $250,000 to the bill, forcing the 
city to apply for more grant money, City Engineer Bert Rapp said. CONSTANCE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PORT DISTRICT GETS $206,000 GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Boating and Waterways Commission has awarded the Ventura Port 
District a $206,000 grant to improve the boat-launching facility at Ventura 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the money will be spent on expanding the existing parking lot from 
about 80 spaces to more than 130 and installing curbs, sidewalks and 
landscaping, port district General Manager Richard Parsons said.Visitors to the 
boat launch often must park on a nearby dirt field because the lot fills up 
quickly on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the grant money will be used to repave the launch itself, Parsons 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the grant money has been awarded by the commission, Parsons said he 
does not expect the paperwork to be processed for several months. That would 
delay any construction bids from going out before the end of the year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons said the district applied for the grant several years ago, but it had 
been put off because of the state budget crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project had been in the budget two years ago, but that's the year 
boating and waterways lost its entire budget," he said. "Given that long delay, 
we're glad to have it finally approved." 
</P>
<P>
 The improvements probably will be completed by the summer of 1995, Parsons 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Boating and Waterways Director John R. Banuelos said improvement 
projects such as the one approved for the Ventura Port District are a boon for 
the local economy. JEFF McDONALD

 Thirteen-year-old Holly Martin has missed a lot of school because of her 
disease. She is also small for her age because the disease stunted her growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly has also been teased by her classmates because when she takes a certain 
medication to control the disease, her face swells. The Fountain Valley 
seventh-grade student can't eat certain foods such as pizza or spaghetti, and 
she has endured a lot of pain since she was diagnosed with Crohn's disease 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to raise public awareness and money for research, a "Strike Out 
Crohn's & Colitis" bowl-a-thon will be held today at Fountain Bowl, 17110 S. 
Brookhurst St. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease affects the intestines and creates a variety of symptoms including 
rectal bleeding, lower abdominal pain and diarrhea. It is not a widely known 
ailment, but an estimated 30,000 people in Orange County suffer from Crohn's 
disease and ulcerative colitis. 
</P>
<P>
 The event will be held from 1 to 6 p.m., and the public is invited to bowl. 
Bowlers can either donate a minimum of $35 to participate or get their own 
sponsors, Angotta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy Drayton, a player for the Los Angeles Rams, will also be on hand from 2 
to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds will go toward research, public and professional education and 
support services for patients and families.

BABY'S DEATH SPOTLIGHTS A RARITY; PARENTING: A FATHER ACCIDENTALLY SUFFOCATED 
HIS 2-MONTH-OLD IN FEBRUARY AS THEY SLEPT. 'FAMILY BED' ADVOCATES DISMISS SUCH 
OCCURRENCES AS EXTREMELY UNLIKELY, BUT OTHERS SAY ANY RISK IS UNACCEPTABLE. 
</P>

<P>
 The accidental suffocation of a 2-month-old infant by her father Feb. 20 has 
briefly spotlighted an extremely rare cause of death known as "paternal 
overlay." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one other Orange County infant has been accidentally smothered by a 
sleeping adult in the past 10 years, according to the Orange County coroner's 
office. Most such incidents involve the father, who typically weighs more than 
the mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Because such deaths are so rare, state and national authorities do not 
separate statistics on overlay deaths from other types of accidental infant 
suffocations. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, some experts believe it is nearly impossible for an adult to 
suffocate a sleeping infant unless the adult is intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 25 years, I have worked with parents who sleep with their infants on a 
constant basis and only one time have I heard of the practice resulting in 
overlay," said Chele Marmet, director of the Lactation Institute in Encino. 
"These accidental cases are definitely rare." 
</P>
<P>
 In each Orange County case, the fathers wwere arrested on suspicion of 
involuntary manslaughter but later freed after being interviewed by police and 
given alcohol and drug tests whose results were negative. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent case, police and coroner's officials in Costa Mesa ruled 
that Jamie Uribe, father of Patricia Lorena Uribe, had accidentally suffocated 
his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the previous, 1989, case, the Orange County district attorney's office 
decided not to prosecute James B. Corbett III of Newport Beach, whose 
6-week-old daughter, Tyra Corbett, suffocated. The death was ruled an accident 
after prosecutors interviewed Newport Beach police and county coroner's 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups that advocate parents' allowing infants and small children to sleep 
with them cite what they see as numerous benefits to the arrangement, among 
them the chance to develop a bond with the child and having the child in close 
proximity during the night for breast-feeding. The groups suggest that the risk 
of accidental suffocation is so small that parents who enjoy the practice need 
not worry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because many fathers are often too busy to spend time during the day with 
their newborns, we encourage them to sleep with the infant to bring about a 
level of familiarity," Marmet said. "I find it very unusual for an overlay to 
occur because a healthy baby will move if there's a weight on top of them and a 
parent will respond." 
</P>
<P>
 But a 1991 alert issued by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission warns 
parents of the practice. "Infants 12 months or younger can suffocate while 
sleeping when they become wedged against adult and mattress," the alert says. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1985 and 1990, the commission said it had received reports of more 
than 250 infants having been suffocated on adult or youth beds when they became 
trapped between a mattress and a frame or wall. The commission did not 
categorize the types of suffocation, although it did attribute some of the 
deaths to parent overlays. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes down to it, the closeness that comes from sleeping with an 
infant does not outweigh the risk of suffocation," said Mary Marlin, a 
registered nurse at Children's Hospital of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlin, who serves as a community liaison instructing parents throughout the 
county on infant care and other children's health matters, said that most 
infants breathe solely through their noses until they are 4 to 6 months old, 
making suffocation more likely in an adult bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Family psychologist Dominic Bronell of Costa Mesa said having a father sleep 
alongside a child may not be the best way to develop familiarity between the 
two because there is little interaction when both are asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obviously beneficial for the father to develop cohesion with the infant, 
but I don't think that sleeping with the child is the best way," said Bronell, 
who specializes in post-traumatic syndromes.

STAR TO PERFORM AT PLAZA OPENING; THOUSAND OAKS: PUBLICIST SAYS BERNADETTE 
PETERS INTENDS TO GIVE A SOLO SHOW AT THE 1,800-SEAT AUDITORIUM IN OCTOBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The grand opening of Thousand Oaks' Civic Arts Plaza will blend local and 
national talent, with veteran Broadway performer Bernadette Peters joining the 
Conejo Symphony Orchestra for a black-tie gala. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Peters has not yet signed a contract, her publicist said the 
acclaimed singer and actress fully intends to perform her eclectic solo show in 
Thousand Oaks' 1,800-seat auditorium Oct. 21 and 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "She considers it booked," publicist Judy Katz said. "She liked the idea that 
she'd be opening a new performing arts center, and she loves playing with 
symphony orchestras. She's excited to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Intent on establishing the Civic Arts Plaza as the premiere cultural center 
between Los Angeles and San Francisco, Thousand Oaks officials said they 
considered Peters' verbal commitment to headline the grand opening a coup. 
</P>
<P>
 "By bringing in a major star, we will announce to the country that we are a 
major force to be dealt with, not a backwater little theater," said Harry 
Selvin, a member of the city's theater commission. "She was our top choice, 
because of her national and international reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 Peters -- a versatile performer who has won rave reviews for her concerts, 
plays and films -- melds songs and drama in her high-energy acts. Drawing on 
country music, Broadway shows and old classics, she creates glitzy performances 
with broad appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 At a concert last fall in the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, for 
instance, Peters sang everything from Lyle Lovett to Stephen Sondheim to 
Rodgers & Hammerstein. Arts critics have praised Peters, who turned 45 last 
week, for her ability to shift from cute to coy to elegant to comic as she 
strives to express the tone of each new song. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a dynamite little gal, she really truly is, and she's got a voice that 
will knock your socks off," said Selvin, who has been negotiating with Peters' 
agent for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Several theater commissioners said they expect a signed contract soon, 
probably within a few weeks. They would not release details about the 
negotiations now. 
</P>
<P>
 But Selvin said Peters' fee for two shows is within the grand opening's 
$80,000 performance budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Selvin also expressed confidence that negotiators had resolved the sticky 
issue of the "out clause," a standard bit of legalese allowing artists to break 
commitments if offered film work or gigs in Las Vegas or Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
 Selvin said Peters has agreed to give at least 60 days' notice if she does 
decide to accept another, more lucrative, deal. In the two months before the 
grand opening, she will not withdraw from the Thousand Oaks shows, no matter 
what other offers she receives, Selvin said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Details of Peters' contract will be available after the star signs all the 
papers, theater commissioners said. At that point, they will also discuss plans 
for the grand opening, a mix of performances, speeches and champagne 
celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets to the shows -- which will open with the Conejo Symphony and local 
choirs performing Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" -- are expected to cost between $50 
and $100. City officials expect sell-out crowds both Friday and Saturday 
nights, especially with a big-name headline act. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peters is a proven star," Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. "She's a very 
enthusiastic performer, and on those days, enthusiasm will be the reigning 
word."

WHEN LIFE STARTS TESTED IN GANG SLAYING CASE; CRIME: WITNESS IDENTIFIES FRIEND 
AS GUNMAN IN DEATH OF TEEN-AGE GIRL AND 3-MONTH-OLD FETUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unusual case dealing with the issue of when life begins, a man testified 
Friday that an alleged gang member fired the shots that killed a 16-year-old 
girl and the 3-month-old fetus of another teen-age victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have alleged there was more than one murder, and that the three 
adult defendants in the case are eligible for the death penalty, even though 
the fetus was too young to have survived outside the mother's womb. 
</P>
<P>
 At Friday's preliminary hearing for Robert Harvey, 20, one of the accused, 
witness Kenyon Brown reluctantly identified his friend Harvey as the gunman in 
a drive-by shooting that took place May 15 in Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, who fired the shots from the car?" asked Deputy Dist. Atty. Franco A. 
Baratta. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was K.P.," Brown said quietly, using Harvey's gang moniker to identify him 
as the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 After testifying, Brown, who admitted he was in the Nissan Maxima during the 
shooting, hung his head so low that he could not be seen by anyone present in 
Van Nuys Municipal Court.  
</P>
<P>
 Also charged in the shooting death of Nikki Foley and the 12- to 16-week-old 
fetus of Mona Moore, 15, are Brandon Reed, 22, and Ronald Ausborne, 20. Moore 
and two other teen-age girls were wounded but survived the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the four girls were talking with members of a local gang in the 
9300 block of Sylmar Avenue when members of a North Hollywood-based gang opened 
fire from a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Because prosecutors have alleged that there was more than one murder, all 
three will be eligible for the death penalty if convicted. Brown, who was 17 at 
the time of the shooting, also faces murder charges in Juvenile Court, but 
cannot be sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is unique due to the age of the fetus. An appeals court in Los 
Angeles ruled in 1977 that a slain fetus must be viable outside the womb -- now 
widely considered to be at the age of 22 weeks -- for a murder to have 
occurred.  
</P>
<P>
 But a San Diego appeals court ruled in May that a fetus must only have 
progressed beyond the embryonic stage of seven or eight weeks for its death to 
be considered a murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges in San Diego said their ruling was consistent with Roe vs. Wade, 
the landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling that gave a woman the right to abort an 
unborn child until it is 13 weeks old. They said their ruling dealt with a case 
in which a woman did not have a right to choose the fate of the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our view, Roe's teachings do not apply to a situation where a third party 
kills a fetus without a mother's consent," the ruling stated. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court heard oral arguments two weeks ago in an attempt 
to decide which of the two cases will become the prevailing law in the state. A 
ruling is expected in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown testified against Harvey Friday as a result of a deal he struck with 
prosecutors. If it is found that he testified truthfully, murder charges will 
be dropped and he will be allowed to plead guilty to being an accessory to the 
crime, Baratta told Judge Robert L. Swasey.  
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said he would not demand any prison time when Brown is 
sentenced.  
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary hearing got off to a late start Friday afternoon because 
Baratta's car was both burglarized and ticketed while he was attending a 
morning meeting in Downtown Los Angeles. It was concluded after Brown answered 
only half a dozen questions because defense attorneys wanted his testimony 
videotaped. 
</P>
<P>
 Swasey then delayed the hearing until next Friday and joked, "We're off to 
such a flying start." 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey, Reed and Ausborne are being held without bail in County Jail. Brown 
has been released from custody but is wearing an electronic bracelet being 
monitored by the Probation Department, Baratta said.

TOPANGA MAN SEEKING TO STAGE RACE OF ENDURANCE; ADVENTURE: THE EVENT WOULD BE A 
CALIFORNIA VERSION OF THE RAID GAULOISES, A 300-MILE CONTEST. OBTAINING PERMITS 
IS KEY OBSTACLE. 
</P>

<P>
 Mark Burnett rarely faces a challenge he does not attempt to meet head-on. 
</P>
<P>
 The 33-year-old Topanga resident organized the first American team in 1992 to 
compete in the Raid Gauloises, a 300-mile adventure race that has been held 
annually in different exotic locales since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnett and four teammates, including one woman, traveled to the Sultanate of 
Oman, where they rode horses, climbed sheer mountain faces and paddled sea 
kayaks through a storm before team unity dissolved. Only Burnett and two other 
members finished the race, placing 39th out of 51 entries. 
</P>
<P>
 Undeterred, Burnett organized a new team that included the same woman and 
three members of the Navy Seals and entered the 1993 Raid in Madagascar. Last 
November, the unit parachuted into the jungle, scaled rocky peaks, canoed 
through rivers, navigated tropical forest and kayaked to a ninth-place finish 
despite severe storms and temperatures as high as 120 degrees. Only 15 of the 
37 teams that started the race completed the course. A documentary on the race 
will be broadcast on KCAL, Channel 9, today at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "When things seem impossible and all seems lost -- it never really is if you 
work together," Burnett said. "That's what the Raid teaches you." 
</P>
<P>
 With two raids under his belt, Burnett is now embarking on perhaps his biggest 
challenge -- organizing and staging a similar race in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming he can get the necessary permits, Burnett said the so-called 
Eco-Challenge will debut in April, 1995. Burnett said he has secured a 
broadcast deal with MTV and has lined up several corporations and equipment 
manufacturers as sponsors. He intends to stage an eight-day, 300-mile race in 
California. The specific site is yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to show people that we're more than natural disasters, that we have 
great things here as well," Burnett said. His home was threatened, but 
survived, during last year's fires, with fire-hose assistance from his Navy 
teammates, who were in town for training. "This race is a perfect way to show 
the various terrain and beauty of this state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If he cannot obtain the permits needed to stage the race in California, 
Burnett said he would take it elsewhere -- possibly to Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 A former member of the British Army Parachute Regiment who gained American 
citizenship in 1990, Burnett said he started and ran several businesses in the 
United States before becoming interested in running an adventure race. 
</P>
<P>
 Married with a 6-month-old son, Burnett said he became interested in the Raid 
after reading an account of the 1990 Raid in Costa Rica. Burnett said he plans 
to compete again this year when the race is held in Borneo -- "to complete a 
personal trilogy" -- as a prelude to staging the Eco-Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnett said the Eco-Challenge will include 50 five-person teams. Entry fee 
for a team and two assistants will be about $7,500. Like the Raid, all teams 
must include at least one woman. The race is not a relay -- all team members 
must cover the entire course together or the team is disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams can also be disqualified for leaving food wrappers, burning living wood 
in campfires or failing to bury human waste. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the major things I want to promote through the race is ecological 
responsibility and sensibility," Burnett said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you see trash on the sidewalk, pick it up and put it in the trash can. If 
you are going to do the race, don't even leave one (snack bar) wrapper. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're calling it the Eco-Challenge. And if you do that, you have to be beyond 
reproach." 
</P>
<P>
 To help with organization, Burnett has contracted Raid Gauloises creator 
Gerard Fusil and his wife, Nellie, as consultants. Gerard Fusil, a French radio 
journalist and sportsman, began his event as an alternative to traditional 
sport. The first race was held in New Zealand in 1989. Since then, the event 
has been contested in Costa Rica, New Caledonia, Oman and Madagascar. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a race like this is not in a beautiful area, it becomes boring," Nellie 
Fusil said from Paris. "You have an obligation, to the competitors and to the 
people who will watch the broadcast of the race, to have a good picture. It's 
important to keep it interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Raid, the exact course for the Eco-Challenge will not be revealed to 
competitors until 24 hours before the race begins. Burnett, however, said 
horsemanship, rock-climbing experience, map reading and navigation skills will 
be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnett said he would like to stage the race in a different state each year. 
He foresees each state eventually staging its own Eco-Challenge as a qualifier 
for a national competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to use this race to show the world, and Americans, that you don't have 
to dream about places like Borneo and places like that, because it's all here 
in the U. S.," Burnett said. "We have everything we need in this country to 
stage a great competition."

YOUTHS' PLAY WITH CAMERA CREATES STIR AMONG EDUCATORS, PARENTS; THOUSAND OAKS: 
REPORTS OF MALES FILMING SCHOOLCHILDREN IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS RESULT IN FLYERS 
BEING SENT TO PARENTS.

 A child-stalker scare in the Conejo Valley turned out Friday to be nothing 
more than a case of three curious teen-agers playing around with a new video 
camera, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The scare was triggered by reports last month of teen-age boys filming 
schoolchildren on residential streets in northern Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of those reports, the Conejo Valley Unified School District sent 9,000 
notices home on Wednesday and Thursday, warning parents of two males who might 
have "an unnatural interest" in young children. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the parents realized the flyers were referring to her 17-year-old son 
and called authorities, who interviewed the boy and his two 17-year-old friends 
late Thursday and decided the youths were just experimenting with the video 
camera, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had decided to have some fun and try to mimic some of the TV talk 
shows," Sheriff's Lt. Larry Reynolds said. "They were driving around and 
interviewing people at random." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the teen-agers had been conducting sidewalk interviews with adults and 
children since early February, though none of the encounters with adults were 
reported to authorities.

<P>
 "These teen-age boys did not realize how seriously things like this are taken 
by parents and by us in the Police Department," Reynolds said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Even though no crime had been committed, we were seriously concerned about 
the motivation of people driving around videotaping small children," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds said the school flyers set off a flurry of calls from worried parents 
to the East Valley Sheriff's Station. The lieutenant said he believed recent 
high-profile attacks on children -- the abduction and slaying of Polly Klaas in 
Petaluma, Calif., and a series of molestations in the San Fernando Valley -- 
might have added to their anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a panic," Reynolds said. "But they were real concerned that maybe 
somebody out there was about to abduct one of their children." 
</P>
<P>
 The two incidents that aroused suspicion occurred on the afternoons of Feb. 5 
and Feb. 27, Paige said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first, two teen-age boys driving a black Ford Bronco filmed a 
6-year-old boy sitting on Sunset Hills Boulevard. The teen-agers asked the boy 
if he wanted some candy, whether he was a boy or a girl, and whether he would 
stand up for the camera. Then they drove off. 
</P>
<P>
 The second incident involved a 10-year-old girl who was hitting a tennis ball 
against her garage door on Storm Cloud Street when two teen-agers got out of a 
white van and started filming her. They asked if she was playing tennis and if 
she needed more tennis balls, Reynolds said, then made a taunting comment when 
she went inside her house. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, deputies learned of a third incident that occurred Feb. 16 and 
involved a 12-year-old boy. The boy's mother said two teen-agers in a black 
truck filmed her son as he walked down the street. They joked that there was a 
new law requiring pedestrians to wear helmets and asked the boy why he wasn't 
wearing one. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of the teen-agers' comments could be misconstrued, Reynolds said 
investigators do not believe the boys meant any harm to the children. 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving the second report, sheriff's deputies contacted Thousand Oaks 
school officials on Tuesday and district officials decided to warn parents. 
Deputies also notified five nearby school districts, though none of those sent 
flyers home. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither school officials nor sheriff's deputies could remember the last time 
such a notice was sent home to Thousand Oaks parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a rare occurrence," said Barbara Ryan, a Conejo Valley administrator. 
"But we felt we wanted to inform the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan said teachers used the incidents as an opportunity to remind students 
about personal safety. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to notifying the schools, the Sheriff's Department also informed 
Neighborhood Watch groups in Thousand Oaks through a recorded message on a 
phone line. 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Fiore, co-chair of the parent-faculty association at Maple Elementary 
School in Thousand Oaks, said even though sheriff's deputies believe the 
incidents were harmless, they serve as a good warning to parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just all really surprised and this will alert us to keep on the 
lookout," she said.

PLANE CRASHES ON MT. PINOS, KILLING PILOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A cargo plane that took off from Burbank Airport crashed and caught fire near 
the top of snow-covered Mt. Pinos in Kern County, killing the pilot, 
authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Killed in the crash was Capt. Magnus Kander, 27, of La Habra Heights. No one 
else was on board. 
</P>
<P>
 The wreckage of the white and blue twin-engine aircraft was spotted a quarter 
of a mile south of the peak at 8,400 feet by Los Angeles County sheriff's 
helicopters just before 8 a.m. Friday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cargo plane was transporting bank documents from Burbank to Oakland for 
Ameriflight, an air cargo company based in Burbank, when it went down, said 
company spokeswoman Karen Seagle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Piper PA-31 was reported missing by Ameriflight workers less than an hour 
after it failed to arrive in Oakland at 1:05 a.m. Friday, said Federal Aviation 
Administrator spokesman Fred O'Donnell. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot's last contact with FAA traffic control tower was at 11:49 p.m. 
Thursday, about 20 minutes after taking off, said O'Donnell. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no report that the pilot had any troubles," O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kander, a native of Sweden, joined Ameriflight last year. He is survived by 
his wife, Lori, a flight attendant.

TEACHER HONORED IN EMOTIONAL CEREMONY; EDUCATION: PACOIMA MIDDLE SCHOOL'S RUTH 
BROWN, FORCED TO RETIRE BECAUSE OF ILLNESS, IS PRAISED BY MAYOR. 
</P>

<P>
 If Ruth Brown had her way, she would teach at Pacoima Middle School for 
another 34 years. But time and her deteriorating health won't allow it. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who began as a physical fitness teacher in 1960 and later moved up to 
dean of students, was forced to leave her job in January due to a malignant 
brain tumor that made it increasingly difficult for her to perform her duties. 
</P>
<P>
 But her 34 years as an educator and youth volunteer in the predominantly 
Latino, working-class neighborhood have not gone unrecognized. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by her daughter and her former principal, Brown was awarded a 
certificate of recognition Friday from the Los Angeles Unified School District 
and the City Council in an emotional ceremony at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not have retired as long as I was effective," said Brown, choking 
back tears. "But we are all given a deck of cards and we play them out." 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief gathering after the presentation, Brown was praised by district 
administrators and city officials, including Mayor Richard Riordan, who called 
Brown "the greatest teacher in the history of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 "How does it feel to be the greatest teacher in the world?" the mayor asked 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," she answered seriously. "I think it would feel better if I 
were still teaching." 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Wale, principal of Pacoima Middle School, said Brown was the first 
person to welcome her when she arrived several years ago to become the school's 
first female principal. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Wale said Brown has "always been in the forefront in trying to 
make sure everybody else was comfortable and happy." 
</P>
<P>
 The students liked Brown so much that a few years ago they dedicated the 
yearbook to her. And faculty members respected her so much that they elected 
her dean of students in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will tell you that Ruth Brown has been the guardian angel of Pacoima Middle 
School," Wale said. "I believe in angels."

DEPUTY ACCUSED OF DRUG-DEAL PLAN; CRIME: THE OFFICER PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO 
BUYING COCAINE IN POLICE STING. PROSECUTOR SAYS HE WOULD HAVE SOLD IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy charged with purchasing more than two 
pounds of cocaine during a sting operation planned to take the contraband to 
Tennessee and become a drug dealer, a prosecutor said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure was made in the downtown Los Angeles Municipal Court, where 
William Barr pleaded not guilty to felony drug charges stemming from 
Wednesday's undercover operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Barr, 25, of Bellflower, formally resigned Friday from the 
Sheriff's Department, where he had been a deputy for 4 1/2 years, recently 
serving as a guard at the Pitchess jail near Castaic, a department spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is no longer a deputy," Deputy Irma Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 During a short arraignment, Judge Barry Taylor set Barr's bail at $50,000 and 
scheduled a preliminary hearing for March 17. Family members present at the 
hearing said they were planning to offer a house as bail security to obtain 
Barr's release. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr is being represented by a public defender, but no attorney has been 
specifically assigned to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Undercover sheriff's deputies said they sold Barr a kilogram, or 2.2 pounds, 
of cocaine Wednesday afternoon in the Terminal Annex post office parking lot in 
downtown Los Angeles. Barr was arrested without incident immediately after the 
transaction, according to sheriff's officials, who added that two semiautomatic 
pistols were seized from Barr's vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the sting came after a monthlong investigation that started 
when a confidential informant said Barr had inquired about purchasing a 
substantial quantity of drugs. Sheriff's Department officials would not comment 
Friday on the identity of the informant. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his arrest, Barr was assigned to the North County Correctional 
Facility, a maximum-security jail at the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho, a 
sprawling facility where more than 10,000 inmates are housed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a criminal complaint filed Friday, Barr was charged with one count of 
possession of cocaine for sale and one count of selling cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Barr would face a maximum of five years in state prison, 
according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Yochelson. The quantity involved in the 
alleged transaction was exactly one kilogram, Yochelson said, explaining that 
if the amount were any larger, the sentence could have been three years longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing policy, Yochelson would not comment on whether Barr was being 
investigated in relation to other drug deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Yochelson said in court that investigators determined that once Barr purchased 
the cocaine, he was planning to leave the Sheriff's Department and move to 
Tennessee to sell it.

WATER OFFICIAL AMENDS DISCLOSURES; UTILITIES: SANTA MARGARITA ENGINEER SAYS HE 
ACCEPTED $6,068 IN GIFTS FROM TWO FIRMS THAT HE RECOMMENDED FOR CONTRACTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Margarita Water District's top engineer Friday filed amended 
financial disclosure forms saying he received thousands of dollars in gifts and 
entertainment from two engineering firms that he recommended for millions of 
dollars in contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Dye, the district's top engineer since 1979, disclosed that he had 
accepted more than the prescribed $250 in gifts during each of four consecutive 
years from Robert Bein, William Frost & Associates, and for three consecutive 
years from MacDonald-Stephens Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 The two engineering firms provided Dye with $6,068 in gifts from 1989 to 1992, 
according to his newly amended statements of economic interest. Dye belatedly 
reported that he accepted more than 260 meals and a $116 stay in an 
unidentified motel at Bein Frost's expense, and about 90 meals and other 
entertainment from MacDonald-Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
 The two firms have been awarded nearly $20 million worth of contracts by the 
district since 1989, and were repeatedly recommended by Dye in apparent 
violation of the state's Political Reform Act. The state law requires public 
officials to abstain from doing anything to influence contract awards involving 
gift-givers for one year after accepting gifts valued at more than $250. Dye 
also reported receiving $656 in meals and other entertainment over the 
four-year period from two other engineering firms -- Dan Boyle Engineering and 
Wal-Con Construction -- that received lucrative contracts. But because the 
gifts from these firms did not exceed $250 in any one year, Dye was free to 
recommend those firms for contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Dye met this week with investigators from the Orange County district 
attorney's office, who are conducting a criminal investigation into potential 
conflict-of-interest violations at the water district. He did not return a call 
for comment. Through a secretary, Dye referred all inquiries to John J. Schatz, 
the district's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Schatz said he had done his part in asking Dye and others to file amended 
forms, and said it was up to the district attorney's office to determine 
whether any criminal charges are warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Schatz accompanying his amended statements, Dye said his 
original financial disclosure forms neglected to show any gifts in all his 
years with the district because of his understanding of the law at the time, 
and guidance provided by the district. 
</P>
<P>
 His statements, Dye said, "were always filed in good faith." 
</P>
<P>
 Dye and the district's operations director, Robert J. Regan, filed their 
amended statements after The Times disclosed that Bein Frost had spent nearly 
$12,000 entertaining Dye and Dan Ferons, his chief assistant, from 1989 to 
1992. Ferons, who was also invited to visit the district attorney's office this 
week, was not required to file statements of economic interest until this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Regan filed amended returns for 1992 and 1993, the two years he has been 
required to file as a "designated employee." Before he was named assistant to 
the district's general manager, he was not required to make the annual filing. 
</P>
<P>
 Regan reported receiving $1,407 over two years from MacDonald-Stephens, Bein 
Frost, Dan Boyle Engineering, Wal-Con and another company that is identified 
only as HDR in Irvine. In previous returns, Regan said he had received no 
gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter explaining the discrepancy, Regan said he had filed previous forms 
"in good faith and in accordance with what I believed to be the correct 
information to the best of my knowledge at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he said, "in light of recent events and subsequent education received on 
my part, I now understand that in accordance with the law I should have filed 
in a different manner. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The acceptance of gifts from contractors by district officials who recommended 
the firms for contracts has been the subject of a joint investigation by the 
district attorney's office and the FBI that has lasted nearly a year. 
Prosecutors say a decision on whether to file criminal charges is expected 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the district's board of directors voted Friday to fill a vacancy in 
its membership caused by the resignation of longtime Chairman Don B. Schone. 
Schone resigned the day The Times reported that he had accepted -- but did not 
disclose -- trips to Mexico that were paid by Bein Frost. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members unanimously elected Betty Olson, 46, a UC Irvine professor of 
environmental science for 20 years and former member of the Irvine Ranch Water 
District. Olson, considered an expert in water research, is to be sworn in as a 
new board member next week. 
</P>
<P>
 In last November's election for four board seats, Olson appeared to receive 
enough votes to win a spot on the board, but lost because of a miscalculation 
by the Orange County registrar of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Olson was chosen from a field of 17 candidates.

CRASH VICTIM WILL GET INTENSIVE THERAPY; PROVIDER: TWO O.C. REHABILITATION 
SERVICES HAVE OFFERED COMPLETE CARE AT NO COST TO THE PATIENT, AN ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANT. 
</P>

<P>
 Owners of a nursing home and two rehabilitation services have come to the 
rescue of Roberto Sanchez Morales, the 24-year-old Mexican national who 
requires intensive therapy after a car crash in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales was transferred on Friday from Tustin Hospital Medical Center to Park 
Tustin Rehabilitation and Health Care Center in Santa Ana owned by Regency 
Health Services, a Newport Beach-based chain of nursing and rehabilitation 
homes.  
</P>
<P>
 The wheelchair-bound patient, who is an illegal immigrant from Mexico, 
suffered massive head and other injuries in the crash. Without help, he was in 
danger of becoming home-bound, unable to support the wife and three children 
who await him in Guerrero, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, he will receive physical, occupational and speech therapy at 
Park Tustin. Officials for the facility said two rehabilitation care companies, 
Team Rehab of Huntington Beach and South Coast Rehabilitation Services of 
Laguna Hills, will offer complete care for Sanchez at no cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachel Bennett, Park Tustin administrator, said Medi-Cal will pay for his room 
and board there. Morales does not, however, qualify for state aid for 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin Hospital Medical Center, under its state license, may only treat 
patients needing acute care, and Morales has improved beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, as family and acquaintances awaited Sanchez's arrival at Park 
Tustin, his brother, Socorro, expressed his deep gratitude to the Orange County 
community and especially to the health-care providers helping his brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no words to express what I feel right now," he said. "I am so 
grateful. Tell everyone out there, 'Thank you very much.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Aponte, an acquaintance of the family, said the health-care providers 
expect that Sanchez will stay at Park Tustin for four to six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, who came to the county in June from a small agricultural village near 
Acapulco, Mexico, was involved in the two-vehicle crash in August in Lake 
Forest. Border Patrol agents said they had been following the car in which 
Sanchez was a passenger, suspecting its five occupants were illegal, when the 
vehicle hit another car, then a curb and went down a ravine. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the other car suffered injuries, but they were not 
life-threatening.  
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez underwent brain surgery, after which he lapsed into a coma for four 
months. Two months ago, he recovered consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to provide him with the therapy he required, Tustin Hospital had been 
searching desperately for a facility that could provide such care, to no avail. 
As an illegal immigrant, he did not qualify for the help he needed and his 
indigent family could do little to help. Sanchez was condemned to a life of 
mental shadows and dependency, said hospital officials.

PEACEFUL ALTERNATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let me congratulate the Conejo Valley Unified School District on its 
recognition that we need to teach kids how to resolve their differences other 
than by violence. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to stop just doing what comes naturally. Violence comes naturally. 
We need to go beyond what's easy and teach non-violent conflict resolution, 
including mediation. One text I recommend for use with teens and adults is 
former President Jimmy Carter's "Talking Peace," which deals with nonviolent 
conflict resolution techniques between individuals and nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Countering violence with violence is ineffective. Offenders need justice. 
Pre-offenders need to be taught new ways of dealing with problems before they 
escalate to violent levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us be peacemakers, not just peacekeepers.

TAGGING THE COUNCIL

 I couldn't believe it when I read that the city of Oxnard would require its 
homeowners to keep graffiti off their property or be penalized.The so-called 
deterrent of going after the taggers who have drivers' licenses nearly made me 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 It is obvious the city has just given up trying to capture taggers and 
recouping monies from them to restore vandalized property. 
</P>
<P>
 If appearances count for anything, it looks like we need some real leaders to 
emerge. The ones at City Hall don't seem to be in control of the situation.

INNOVATIVE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the past year, the approval of a card casino has been discussed, 
defeated and is not back again on the front burner. The differences between 
earlier proposals and this one are profound. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, there is a concept that is very innovative and responds to the dire 
need for a project that will put Oxnard on the map in a favorable way. This 
proposal includes class restaurants, a deli, top-notch entertainment, gift 
shops, banquet facilities for up to 1,500 people, art and style shows, 
supervised areas for parking, conventions, seminars and boutiques. 
</P>
<P>
 There is not anything in this county that is remotely close to this project. 
The individual who proposes all this is to be applauded and encouraged to bring 
it to fruition.

REFRESHING CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After years and years of wrong decisions, the Thousand Oaks City Council is 
finally beginning to make sense. The defeat of Mayor Elois Zeanah's wetlands 
ordinance is a refreshing change from the all-out assault on private property 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was just another covert law for government to gain control over 
the rights of individuals. Make no mistake. The primary purpose of this 
ordinance was not to protect wetlands, but rather to gain additional control 
over planning and development of real property.  
</P>
<P>

SURVIVAL INSTINCTS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Down on the Oxnard Plain, they joke that it takes six Ojaians to change a 
light bulb: one to replace the bulb, five to assess the environmental impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ojai Valley is increasingly perceived in the rest of the county as a nest 
of environmental radicals who oppose all progress."NIMBY eco-fascists" they 
call us, for fighting the Weldon Landfill and the National Weather Service's 
radar tower. 
</P>
<P>
 What is it about Ojai, anyway, that makes us so protective of our turf? Some 
say it's the topography, which geographically defines us and gives us a strong 
sense of place -- brings out our territorial instincts. Others wax mystic about 
pink moments and Chumash spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason, it works. Over the years, the people of Ojai have routed 
some tough intruders: Petrochem, Waste Management Inc., the Franciscan Corp. 
And as a result, Ojai today is very well preserved compared to most of the 
other communities in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of ridiculing us, the folks on the Oxnard Plain would be wise to 
emulate us. If they do, they just might have more than an acre or two of open 
space left 10 years from now.

DOWNTOWN REVIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Does our downtown Ventura have a vision, or are we living in a bygone era? 
</P>
<P>
 The end of innocence for downtowns across the country came with the concurrent 
auto/baby boom following World War II.The first to recognize these changes was 
J. Levitt, who turned a Long Island potato farm into Levittown, setting off an 
explosion of tract housing that inures to our populace to this day. The advent 
of this explosion signaled the end of the central core concept of city 
builders. 
</P>
<P>
 Times have changed, and we have not. America's downtowns have become 
service-centered as opposed to commerce-centered entities. The future is now, 
if we are willing to accept as inevitable the permanence of change. Downtown 
Ventura, as it stands, cannot accommodate major department stores or discount 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
 The survival of our downtown is keyed to a recognition that tourism is but one 
of the essential elements in the mix. Another part is the development of 
housing, which will encourage the development of transportation facilities, 
which will revitalize the support services which in turn attract tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 People are the vital link. They create the need for the marketplace to fill. 
Other peripheral benefits are to be found in the preservation and extension of 
whatever greenbelt is left. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the downtown associations laid end to end won't have the singular 
impact of a planned city center.

AT A DISADVANTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As an independent candidate for the presidency in 1992, I did quite well at 
the personal level. People with whom I shared my ideas about how to 
dramatically improve America seemed quite impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 But we do not have a manner by which unwealthy and/or boldly 
independent-minded people can share their views directly with the American 
people. Only persons with lots of money or persons backed by persons who have 
lots of money can get sufficient exposure via the various media for sale to 
achieve political viability. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe this situation to be unfair to the American people, and it has 
proven absolutely disastrous for our nation. We are on the skids. Our 
government is breaking us. 
</P>
<P>
 At any rate, from now until July 4, 1996, I shall be preparing once again to 
campaign independently for the presidency of the United States and completing a 
book entitled "Why I Want the Presidency and What I Will Try to Accomplish 
Should I Get the Presidency." But I doubt that without publicly sponsored 
campaign exposure I will be able to snatch the presidency from Bill Clinton 
because Americans "just won't read like they used to" -- we have fallen so in 
love with our boob tubes.

TWO ACCIDENTS INJURE MAN, 21, AND WOMAN, 81 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 81-year-old woman and a 21-year-old man were in critical condition Friday 
after being involved in separate accidents in Irvine and Huntington Beach on 
Thursday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Irvine incident, Barry Lucido, 21, was driving alone in his pickup 
truck east on Walnut Avenue at 8:50 p.m. when he lost control of the vehicle, 
drove up the street's center divider and collided with a tree, Irvine Police 
Sgt. Brian Clifton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucido of Irvine was trapped inside the truck until being extricated by the 
Orange County Fire Department. He was arrested at the scene on drunk-driving 
charges and taken to Western Medical Center in Santa Ana where he is in 
critical condition, Clifton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a sharp turn in the road where you have to veer right then go back to 
the left and for some reason, he didn't make the turn," Clifton said. "(Lucido) 
lives in the area and should be familiar with the road." 
</P>
<P>
 There were no other vehicles involved in the accident, Clifton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Thursday, 81-year-old Mary Nefos was walking across a Brookhurst 
Street frontage road in Huntington Beach at 1:37 p.m. when she was struck by a 
car being driven by an 18-year-old Huntington Beach woman, Huntington Police 
Lt. Jeff Cope said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nefos, a resident of Tamaqua, Pa., was knocked down and suffered head and neck 
injuries. She was taken to Western Medical Center in Santa Ana where she is in 
critical condition, hospital officials said.

QUAKE-HAMPERED GIRL SCOUT COOKIE DRIVE TO FINALLY BEGIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA ANN WILLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley Girl Scout cookie sales campaign, delayed by the 
aftermath of the Northridge earthquake, will finally get under way today with a 
ceremony at Burbank Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time in the San Fernando Council's 30-year history that the 
sales campaign, originally scheduled to begin Jan. 29, had been postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least at this point, if anybody's in their house when they order, it's 
reasonable that they might still be there when the cookies come," said Arlene 
Faber, the council's interim executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "Make it Happen -- Women in Early Aviation" is the theme for this year's 
cookie drive. A group of women pilots called the 99s will be on hand to discuss 
the role women played in early aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the group -- some of whom began flying with Amelia Earhart, the 
group's first president -- will teach older Girl Scouts how to map out flight 
plans. All Scouts will build wooden airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Scouts will rehearse good sales and safety techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Scouts begin preparing for the door-to-door sales campaign today, 
direct sales in front of local business won't begin until April 22. By then, 
there should be "an adequate distribution of places that are back in business," 
Faber said.

POLICE TO GO DOOR-TO-DOOR IN SHOOTING PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police are planning a door-to-door search today to investigate two incidents 
during the past week in which moving cars were the targets of gunfire in the 
8600 block of Moody Street. One person was injured in the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Both incidents took place at 5 a.m. in the northbound lanes of Moody just 
south of Crescent Avenue, Cypress Police Lt. John Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 55-year-old man driving northbound on Moody on Friday was wounded when a 
bullet passed through the driver's side door of his vehicle and struck him in 
the thigh, police said. He was taken to Los Alamitos General Hospital for 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, a 43-year-old woman who had heard a noise while driving on Moody 
later found a bullet hole in the rear door of the driver's side of her vehicle, 
police said.

JURY STILL UNDECIDED IN TRIAL OF MAN CHARGED IN TRIPLE MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jurors who earlier in the week hinted at possible deadlock in the retrial of a 
biker gang leader accused of triple murder went home for the weekend without 
reaching a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury in Orange County's longest-running criminal case has been 
deliberating the fate of Thomas Maniscalco, 48, since Feb. 7.On Wednesday, they 
indicated they were having trouble reaching a verdict. The Orange County 
Superior Court judge ordered them to resume deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 They are expected back Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors in Maniscalco's first trial deliberated 26 days in 1990 before 
concluding they were hopelessly deadlocked. Maniscalco is accused of 
masterminding the slayings of Richard (Rabbit) Rizzone, 36; Rizzone's 
bodyguard, Thomas Monahan, 28; and Rizzone's girlfriend, Rena Miley, 19, on 
Memorial Day, 1980, at Rizzone's home in Westminster. Miley also was raped. 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco, a lawyer who had a law practice in Orange County before his arrest 
in 1984, has denied the charges and said he is being framed for crimes he did 
not commit. Maniscalco has been in the Orange County Men's Jail longer than any 
other inmate.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; REGIONAL JEWISH GROUP GAINS CLOUT; DEMOGRAPHICS: THE 
FEDERATION COUNCIL OF GREATER LOS ANGELES AGREES TO MORE REPRESENTATION FOR 
NEWLY NAMED SAN FERNANDO VALLEY ALLIANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jewish leaders in the San Fernando Valley have won more clout within the 
community service behemoth known as the Jewish Federation Council of Greater 
Los Angeles, as well as achieving a degree of autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 The federation, which has 450 affiliated community and religious 
organizations, a 206-member board and nearly 1,750 employees, raised $42 
million last year. About half of the money goes to Israel and the rest to the 
federation's 15 agencies, internal operations and related entities. 
</P>
<P>
 The sizable Jewish population of the San Fernando Valley and environs has been 
pressing for greater local control within the federation, a movement similar to 
demands for more Valley autonomy in Los Angeles political and public school 
agencies. Jewish community leaders addressed those demands in six months of 
negotiations at the federation's headquarters on Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The discussions were heated at times, but Valley people felt they had not 
been given their due and promises that had been made before had not been 
implemented," said federation President Terry Bell, herself a Van Nuys native. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an agreement announced this week, the newly named San Fernando Valley 
Alliance of the federation will have six appointees (instead of one) on the 
federation's 40-member executive committee. Representation on the 33-member 
planning and allocation committee will also rise from one member to six. 
</P>
<P>
 And, for the first time, the Valley-based federation officers will have 
control of their own spending within an allocated budget and will do their own 
hiring and firing, said Earl Greinetz, president of the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line of the whole move was that we felt the Valley could raise 
more money if people here felt we had more responsibility and independence," 
said Greinetz, owner of a property management company and who lives and works 
in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 The upgrading of the Valley region to a partially independent body arrives a 
little before the federation's annual Super Sunday appeal for the United Jewish 
Fund on March 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 2,000 telephone volunteers will be calling potential donors that day from 
the temporary Woodland Hills headquarters of the Alliance, which was displaced 
by the Jan. 17 earthquake from its permanent location on the Bernard Milken 
Jewish Community Campus in West Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Valley region -- which includes the San Fernando, Antelope, 
Santa Clarita, Simi and Conejo valleys -- raised $6.3 million of the 
federation's $42 million total. 
</P>
<P>
 That did not necessarily represent the true proportion of Valley giving, 
Greinetz said. He pointed out that Valley donors could pledge gifts through 
their workplace, trade association or other organizations that might be located 
in another part of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we raise a lot more money than shows up in the 'Valley' amount," 
Greinetz said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, many Jewish leaders admit that they can only guess what 
proportion of the estimated 600,000 Los Angeles area Jews live north of 
Mulholland Drive. Federation officials sometimes say half, sometimes less than 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 Greinetz estimated that the Valley may have 40% of the Jewish population 
served by the federation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we need to do a demographic study," Bell said, "but it would be so 
expensive that we feel it is more important to help people instead." 
</P>
<P>
 She also emphasized in an interview that, despite some decentralization, there 
are some region-wide federation programs and functions that override 
geographical divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Helping the homeless and maintaining the kosher kitchen on Fairfax Avenue, 
for example, is as important to Valley people as it is to the rest of the 
Jewish community," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Greinetz said the Valley has special, lingering problems 
resulting from layoffs in the aerospace industry and new ones deriving from 
heavy earthquake damage to residences in communities such as Sherman Oaks with 
large Jewish populations. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Jewish agencies with Valley offices are those assisting in job training, 
crisis counseling, education, loans to the needy, legal assistance and 
companionship for children from broken homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Jewish religious leaders have complained in past decades that the Jewish 
Federation Council had a strongly secular cast and did not work readily with 
synagogues. That trend has reversed itself in recent years, most observers say, 
but in the Valley relations between the synagogues and federation agencies 
appear to be well-established. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the people I work with in the federation are synagogue-oriented people," 
said Greinetz, who is a vice president at Valley Beth Shalom in Encino and was 
once president of a synagogue that has since merged with another. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in the Los Angeles Times Poll of San Fernando Valley adults in 
December, 1991, 10% of those surveyed said they were Jewish, and of those, 44% 
belonged to a congregation. Most surveys of Los Angeles Jews have indicated 
that synagogue affiliation ranges around 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 The synagogues and rabbis who do work with the federation are primarily in the 
large Reform and Conservative branches of Judaism. The federation historically 
has had difficulty involving Orthodox religious bodies, whose interpretation of 
Jewish law and practices tends to set them apart from non-religious and 
non-Orthodox Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are doing outreach to the Orthodox synagogues in the Valley, and we very 
much want them to be a part of us," Greinetz said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the San Fernando Valley Alliance of the Jewish Federation Council looks 
ahead, however, Bell and Greinetz conceded in separate interviews that there 
may be a day when the Jewish communities in Conejo, Santa Clarita and other 
valleys may find it irritating to be lumped in with the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that people in the Conejo Valley are going to say we 
want representation," Bell said. "They are voices we will have to listen to."

SEIZURE LAW EXPIRATION STYMIES AUTHORITIES; FINANCES: NARCOTICS OFFICERS AND 
PROSECUTORS STRUGGLE TO OPERATE WITHOUT A VALUABLE -- AND PROFITABLE -- TOOL.

 Area law enforcement officials are grappling with the loss of a powerful tool 
and lucrative source of income -- the state's asset forfeiture law, which 
expired Jan. 1. No longer can they routinely seize cash and other property from 
alleged drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past five years the sale of confiscated assets tied to drug trafficking 
generated about $155 million in the state, including nearly $2 million in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 While the legislature considers new forfeiture proposals, police agencies and 
prosecutors remain stymied. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Doug Storm heads the 30-member Orange County sheriff's narcotics team 
that recently found 2,000 pounds of cocaine in a raid at a Cerritos home. About 
$3 million in cash that the task force seized during raids is frozen in a bank 
account while the law is in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
 About 400 forfeiture hearings and trials have been put on hold. "It's a 
complete mess," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard de la Sota, who handles 
forfeiture cases for Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking away forfeiture laws means "a setback to our efforts to stop drug 
trafficking," said Sharon Diggs-Jackson, analyst for the Long Beach Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the sale of confiscated property have paid for training and 
equipment for narcotics officers and drug education programs, she said. The 
department has purchased a helicopter and has put about 10 confiscated cars and 
trucks into service. 
</P>
<P>
 Local police agencies were able to keep 76.5% of the proceeds from confiscated 
property under the old law. The rest was divided between local district 
attorneys offices and the state Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical forfeiture case involves cash, cars and telephones, Diggs-Jackson 
said. Long Beach police also have seized boats, motorcycles, stocks and bonds, 
personal watercraft vehicles, jewelry, high-tech weapons and even small 
airplanes. Also, Diggs-Jackson said, police have routinely confiscated items 
used in the drug trade, such as scales and money-counting machines.

JUDGE UPHOLDS MALIBU CIVIC CENTER DEVELOPMENT BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Settling one of the most contentious land-use issues since Malibu was 
incorporated in 1991, a Superior Court judge has upheld the city's interim 
zoning ordinance, a ruling that stalls the development of a 125-acre parcel of 
land in the civic center area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Malibu Village Civic Assn., a group of 15 civic center landholders who had 
sued the city to clear the way for the mixed-use residential and commercial 
project, plans to appeal or ask Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne to 
reconsider her decision, which was made last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling halts plans for what has been considered one of Southern 
California's most ambitious coastal development projects in years. It would 
transform Malibu's largely undeveloped civic center area, north of Pacific 
Coast Highway between Cross Creek and Stuart Ranch roads, into a mix of 
bungalows, estate homes, apartments and condominiums for up to 1,500 people, 
interspersed with shops and offices built around a village green. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit was filed in April by the landholders group, which includes the 
largest commercial landholders in Malibu: the Konheim and Perenchio families of 
the Malibu Bay Co. The suit asked the court to overturn the zoning ordinance on 
the grounds that it does not comply with the state Environmental Quality Act. 
The act requires cities to conduct an environmental impact report before a 
development project or land-use ordinances are approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance outlaws residential development in the civic center, prohibits 
new multi-family housing in the city and places strict limits on other kinds of 
development. The ordinance was adopted in February, 1993, after a two-year 
building moratorium expired. It is a temporary measure while the city completes 
its General Plan, due in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit asserted that the city violated state environmental laws in 
numerous technical ways, among them by adopting the ordinance without preparing 
an environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 "The irony of the lawsuit is that the developer is trying to use an 
environmental act against an environmental City Council," said Deputy City 
Atty. Christi Hogin. "(The State Environmental Quality Act) has been 
interpreted by the court to include adoption of an ordinance. And like a 
(development) project, the act requires that you do a study to determine that 
there will be no adverse effects on the environment. We did a study." 
</P>
<P>
 Concern that the interim ordinance might be included in the city's General 
Plan prompted the lawsuit, which has cost the city about $250,000, Hogin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at all the (legal) options," said the landholders' attorney, 
Allan J. Abshez. "(Judge Wayne) basically justified her decision based on the 
fact that the city's zoning law was interim. Our concern is that it represents 
permanent policy direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Hogin said that, by law, the City Council must review the interim zoning 
ordinance when the General Plan is adopted, and ensure that it is consistent 
with the plan's building ordinances. But, "I don't think that you are going to 
see a radical plan change between the interim zoning ordinance and the General 
Plan," she said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 7 CANDIDATES IN VIOLATION OF CAMPAIGN POSTER 
CODE; SANTA CLARITA: CITY COUNCIL HOPEFULS ARE REQUIRED TO LIST WHO PAID FOR 
SIGNS. WHISTLE-BLOWER FRED HEISER IS GUILTY OF TOO-SMALL TYPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 About half the 13 candidates for City Council have violated a local ordinance 
by posting signs that fail to say who paid for them, much to the annoyance of 
candidate Fred Heiser who brought the matter to the city clerk's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But he who lives in a glass candidacy perhaps shouldn't be so fast to throw 
stones. While Heiser's signs have the appropriate disclosure on them, it 
appears the information isn't large enough -- so he's in violation of the code 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The city clerk sent out warning letters to the violators. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs by incumbents Carl Boyer, Jo Anne Darcy and Jill Klajic and challengers 
Tim Jorgensen, Clyde Smyth and Linda Storli fail to adequately disclose who 
paid for them, violating an ordinance passed by the City Council in December, 
1992. Five other candidates, including two who dropped out of the race last 
month, have not posted signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Heiser has been the most vocal about the mistakes by incumbents, saying they 
should know and adhere to legislation they voted upon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's any intent to malign here," said Heiser, 37. "I just 
think it's stupid these clowns would pass this with so much ballyhoo and then 
ignore it." 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance was approved by a 4-0 vote Dec. 8, 1992, with Councilwoman 
Klajic absent. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the problems with the council is they pass something without realizing 
the implications of it," said Heiser, an engineer for Lockheed. "They do these 
things almost on a whim." 
</P>
<P>
 According to city staffers, Heiser first complained after he was notified some 
of his signs were illegally placed in the public right of way and had to be 
moved. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have no plans to apply the code's penalty of $1,000 or up to 
six months in jail, but letters have been sent out to remind candidates of the 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a slip-up -- no excuse," said Klajic, 47. "He's absolutely right. I 
think the voter has the right to know and the material should say who paid for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Klajic originally opposed the 1992 ordinance, calling for more regulation of 
contributions by special interest groups. She said both of her billboards are 
going to be amended. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next time, instead of insisting that all my campaign volunteers read the 
ordinance, I'm going to read it myself," Klajic said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Darcy similarly characterized the violation as an oversight, 
saying she was unaware it applied to large signs. Her four billboards are also 
going to be corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Boyer could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Heiser is less critical of new candidates who overlooked or misread the 
legislation. This includes his own 3 by 4 foot signs, which violate the same 
ordinance by having the disclosures printed too small. The information is 
supposed to be in 12-point type on an 8.5 by 11 inch piece of paper and 
proportionately larger for bigger signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to great effort to get disclaimers on my signs," said Heiser, who said 
the printer made the lettering too small and that replacements are on the way. 
"It's not as big as it should be, but it's there." 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates who violated the ordinance are admitting their errors and 
taking steps to correct them. 
</P>
<P>
 Some characterized Heiser's complaints as petty and saw some irony in that he 
violated the code as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he should be more interested in expounding his views rather than 
nit-picking," said Darcy, 62. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in glass houses shouldn't throw rocks," said Dennis Farnham, 49. "If 
he's in violation, he shouldn't say anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically Farnham, an officer with the Los Angeles Police Department, is the 
only candidate who posted signs that didn't violate the ordinance, but took 
them down anyway as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
 Farnham removed all 50 of his 12 by 16 inch signs Wednesday because they 
included the name of his campaign committee but no address. He met with City 
Manager George Caravalho Friday, who interpreted the ordinance to mean the 
disclosure must include either piece of information, but not necessarily both. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I have to put them up again," Farnham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Farnham said council members should know the requirements of an ordinance that 
they voted on, but added that bringing up a technical violation is petty. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates Jorgensen and Storli could not be reached for comment.

MARINA FINISHES UNDEFEATED RUN; GIRLS' SOCCER: VIKINGS WIN SECOND CONSECUTIVE 
TITLE WITH 3-0 VICTORY OVER PENINSULA. UNBEATEN STREAK REACHES 39. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Before Marina took the field to defend its Southern Section Division I girls' 
soccer title Friday night, Coach Bobby Bruch talked about how good the view is 
from the top once a team wins it all. 
</P>
<P>
 This season the Vikings have been no place else but the top, but after 
defeating Palos Verdes Peninsula, 3-0, they can finally take a look around. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing before 500 at Cerritos Gahr High, top-seeded Marina brought home its 
second consecutive championship and this time the Vikings can keep it to 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Vikings shared the title with Claremont after playing to a 
1-1 tie in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina (28-0-1) entered the season as the top-ranked team in Division I and 
Orange County and stayed there the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is huge," Marina Coach Bobby Bruch said. "I don't think it has sunk in 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings extended their unbeaten streak to 39 games. They last lost Jan. 
27, 1993, to Edison in a Sunset League game. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first 10 minutes, Peninsula, which lost to the Vikings, 3-1, earlier 
this season, appeared to be up for Marina's challenge, but the last 70 minutes, 
the Panthers looked more like a team looking for a place to hide. 
</P>
<P>
 The pace was fast during the first half with Peninsula getting good scoring 
opportunities early and Marina pounding away at the Peninsula goal late. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before halftime, Marina broke through during a flurry of shots that 
bounced off player after player before Amy Rubenstein found enough room and put 
the ball in the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am so excited right now," Rubenstein said. "Peninsula came out really 
aggressive, but after I scored, we all said we wanted more." 
</P>
<P>
 Third-seeded Peninsula (26-2-1) had its best chances to score in the first 
half. The Panthers hit the post twice in and Traci Arkenberg missed wide left 
on a breakaway. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkenberg, who scored 56 goals for the Panthers this season, never threatened 
the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina added to its lead 16 minutes into the second half when Jenny Benson 
scored over Panther goalkeeper Kristina Mortaloni from 20 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
 With 13 minutes left, Cassie Campbell scored her team-high 29th goal of the 
season with 13 minutes left on a header after a corner kick by Marcy Crouch. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning back to back titles and rolling through a season unbeaten, Bruch 
has already pinpointed his goals for next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be the first girls' soccer team to win three straight 
championships," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With all but two starters returning next season, Bruch should keep that room 
at the top reserved.

MIGHTY DUCKS BEAT THE OILERS, LOOK TO SHARKS; HOCKEY: WITH ANAHEIM'S 4-1 
VICTORY, THE RACE FOR FINAL PLAYOFF SPOT IN THE WESTERN CONFERENCE TIGHTENS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Has it really gotten to this point, that the Mighty Ducks can have must-win 
games? 
</P>
<P>
 That's pretty much what Friday night's game against the Edmonton Oilers was -- 
the sort the Ducks have to win if they're serious about making a run at the 
playoffs in their first season. 
</P>
<P>
 They needed to win and they did, 4-1, before a 17th consecutive sellout crowd 
of 17,174 at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Guy Hebert made 24 saves, four Ducks scored goals and defenseman David 
Williams tied his career high with three points on a goal and two assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big win," said Joe Sacco, who scored his seventh goal in the last 
nine games and 14th of the season. "It's huge. It gives us some momentum going 
into the San Jose game, and we haven't played very well against them." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonton, the worst team in the Pacific Division, had lost to San Jose the 
night before, and the Sharks -- who have the eighth and final Western 
Conference playoff spot -- extended their lead over the Ducks and Kings to five 
points, at least for a day. 
</P>
<P>
 A loss to Edmonton would have been demoralizing for the Ducks -- and would 
have sent them into Sunday's crucial game at San Jose needing to win to avoid 
falling seven points back in the scramble for that playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they have an opportunity to cut San Jose's lead to one point. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ron Wilson is looking at the San Jose game as another that his team must 
win. It is their final meeting of the season with the team they are chasing -- 
and the Ducks are 0-5 against the Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine, Wilson says, where the Ducks would be if they'd only played .500 
against the Sharks. Or calculate it -- they'd be seven points ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely owe them a few games," said Hebert, who was sharp in allowing 
fewer than three goals for the first time since Ron Tugnutt was traded. "Being 
in the playoff hunt is extremely exciting. It's better than wasting the last 20 
games of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 The game against Edmonton was a penalty-filled one that included rare 
overlapping five-minute major penalties against the Ducks. That meant a two-man 
advantage for the Oilers for what seemed an eternal 3:35. The Ducks' spirited 
effort helped them kill a 5-on-3 short-handed situation, and they came within 
10 seconds of thwarting the entire second major before Fredrik Olausson's goal 
gave the Oilers' a 1-0 lead at 16:13 of the first. 
</P>
<P>
 That power play came after Stu Grimson was given a charging major for 
barreling into Edmonton goalie Bill Ranford outside the crease, and then Don 
McSween got a high-sticking major and automatic game misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks nearly killed it off, with the help of defensemen Mark Ferner and 
Bobby Dollas, but Edmonton broke through just before the last penalty expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Dire as the situation seemed, the Ducks escaped it by allowing only one goal, 
and Coach Ron Wilson thought this was the turning point. 
</P>
<P>
 Dollas tied the score shortly later, with a slap shot from the right point. 
Tim Sweeney scored the go-ahead goal from close range at 5:39 of the second 
after Terry Yake's second-effort pass came to him across the crease as Yake was 
being pushed away from the play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a strange game, there wasn't much flow," Wilson said. "I think we were 
a little nervous. We're starting to realize the importance of every game right 
now." Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The highly charged game spilled over after the final horn, as the teams 
tussled in front of the Edmonton goal. Stu Grimson was assessed a 
cross-checking minor and a 10-minute game misconduct. Todd Ewen was given a 
roughing minor, as was Edmonton's Dave Manson. "Things got pretty ugly at the 
end of the game," Coach Ron Wilson said. "They did some really mean things that 
were cheap. Luckily no one was hurt."  
</P>

IT'S VERBUM DEI'S NIGHT IN FINAL; PREP BASKETBALL: MILLER SCORES 32 AS THE 
EAGLES WIN THEIR FIRST TITLE SINCE 1979. CANTRELL HAS 37 FOR SANTA CLARA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The words were different, but Andre Miller and Damian Cantrell had the same 
notion Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I should take over," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted the ball," Cantrell echoed. 
</P>
<P>
 The seniors got their wishes, but in the end missed shots proved the 
difference as Miller's Verbum Dei High overcame Cantrell's Oxnard Santa Clara, 
71-65, to win the Southern Section Division IV-A championship at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, a 6-foot-2 guard, scored a team-high 32 points, including 24 in the 
first half when the Eagles (24-2), ranked No. 13 by The Times, took a 44-34 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, Cantrell scored 21 of his 37 points, including eight in 
the first three minutes of the fourth quarter to carry the Saints (19-8) to a 
59-58 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Verbum Dei then went on a decisive 10-2 run to take a 70-63 lead with 29 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who guarded Cantrell in the fourth quarter, was impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took it to me," said Miller, who made 12 of 21 shots and had 10 rebounds. 
"He wasn't afraid to play, and he took it to the basket." 
</P>
<P>
 Cantrell made 16 of 31 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mike Kearney, coach of Verbum Dei: "I did catch on to (Miller's) ear 
about trying to stop this kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Verbum Dei, which lost Southern Section title games in 1990 (Santa Clara), 
1991 (Santa Clara) and 1993 (Serra), won its first championship since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Santa Clara's downfall came at the free-throw line, where the Saints 
made seven of nine, the Eagles 13 of 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we didn't get some breaks on some calls," said Lou Cvijanovich, who 
has coached Santa Clara to 13 titles in 36 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Cvijanovich was pleased the team did not quit when falling behind early 
in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody in the stands thought when we got down by 10 we'd get blown out," 
he said. "That wasn't the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Cvijanovich made a defensive switch to start the second half, putting 6-3 
senior Jess Pena on Miller, replacing the slower Cantrell. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller scored eight points after the break. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got physical and took me out of my game," Miller acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the first half, Miller was virtually unstoppable in making four of five 
three pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't shot many threes in a while, I've been driving to the basket so I 
thought I should take some and see how they were going," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamal Cobbs scored 17 points and Deon Williams added 10 for the Eagles. Pena, 
who had 10, was the only Saint besides Cantrell to score at least 10. 
</P>
<P>
 But it came down to a game of two. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cvijanovich: "It's always exciting to see outstanding basketball players. 
We had one and they had one." 
</P>
<P>
 And in the end, Verbum Dei's one -- Andre Miller -- was enough.

IT'S THE WATER, AND A LOT MORE; MARATHON: VOLUNTEERS AND THEIR STATIONS ARE A 
BIG PART OF THE BIG RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The assignment is water stations. 
</P>
<P>
 The instructions are to talk to some of the 3,750 who will hand cups of water 
to the runners Sunday in the Los Angeles Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 You have seen them on television. They are the ones stationed at each mile 
along the course, handing a competitor a green Gatorade cup and then jumping 
out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 They are not worried about a collision. They are worried about the runners 
spitting the water back on them. 
</P>
<P>
 In the annals of road-racing journalism, this assignment is what is known as 
the last frontier. 
</P>
<P>
 We can think of only one question. 
</P>
<P>
 How hard can it be? 
</P>
<P>
 You have been working water stations since you were 8. When somebody told you 
to hand lemonade to that guy running across the front yard with a lawn mower. 
</P>
<P>
 How hard can it be? 
</P>
<P>
 We are standing on a street outside the Coliseum in early February, listening 
to a race official lecturing volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grab the top of the cup with your thumb and middle finger," Joe Blackstone 
says. "Hold it out for the runner to take it from you. Try to move with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Blackstone demonstrates. The volunteers go, "Hmmm," and nod their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 As if he had just diagramed the Pythagorean Theorem. We are still confused. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman appears. Her name is Jacquie Jacquet-Williams. She is the captain of 
the station at Mile 25 along Exposition Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 How hard can it be? Her eyes widen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year we ran out of water," she says. "Had to make a deal with the family 
who lived behind our station. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to give them snacks and cookies and whatever we had just so we could 
hook up a hose to their house." 
</P>
<P>
 A man appears. Ulysses S. Griggs Jr., Mile 24 on Rodeo Road. He is shaking his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 How hard can it be? One woman shows up at his station every year trying to 
sell barbecue to the runners. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman, wearing much less, tries to sell something else. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ask them if they can't please wait until the race is over," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Another man appears. Andy Ronquillo, Mile 16 in Hancock Park. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ronquillo first volunteered, he worked at Mile 9 on Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 How hard can it be? He was there about an hour when he realized the water 
station was directly in front of a crack house. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these people coming out of there wanting us to give them things," 
Ronquillo recalls. "I told the marathon people, 'Get me out of here!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Marathon organizers have since arranged for the station to be sponsored and 
staffed by employees of Rose Hills Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a stroke of unmatched brilliance. Gang members still wander out of the 
nearby apartment buildings, and they sometimes still attempt to steal the 
Gatorade. 
</P>
<P>
 But when they get one look at those Rose Hills caps, they have second 
thoughts. The same as those runners who arrive at the station with ideas about 
quitting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of our guys actually think this would be a good place to hand out our 
cards," says Judi Hurner, Mile 9 captain. 
</P>
<P>
 Not many of these water station people are actual runners: "The only time 
you'd find me running is if my keys weren't in my car," Ronquillo says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are homeless: The Los Angeles Mission works Mile 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are recovering alcoholics and drug abusers experiencing society for the 
first time in weeks: The Los Angeles Alliance for a Drug-Free Community works 
Mile 2. 
</P>
<P>
 What brings the diverse group together one Sunday each year could be what 
Julie Hofstedt, a Los Angeles Alliance coordinator, feels when waiting for the 
runners at Mile 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're standing there, 10,000 people running at you all at once, all of them 
wanting water. . . . It's really something," she says. "To think you can get 
that kind of adrenaline rush without running." 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Mulvaney gets a different sort of rush. When she agreed to run a station 
for the inaugural marathon in 1986, she was stunned to be given Mile 1 on 
Figueroa Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Not because she couldn't believe anybody would be thirsty that soon. But only 
one block away was the site of her childhood home. 
</P>
<P>
 She spread the word to four siblings. They began gathering at each race to 
reminisce. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Mile 1 is more than a water station, it's a family reunion. It is the 
only time of the year that three generations of Mulvaneys and Wolfes gather 
together from around the state to talk about days when a young city still held 
wonders.  
</P>
<P>
 The house has become a parking lot. The party survives. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes the field only 20 minutes to pass them, so they are finished by 9 
a.m., when they drive downtown for breakfast at Philippe's. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the one time of the year when Angelenos take back their city," says 
Mulvaney, 71. 
</P>
<P>
 A few of the water stations' little-known oddities: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Volunteers pass out tap water only if they run out of everything else. 
</P>
<P>
 Tap water, you see, doesn't come with a sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Elite runners, the guys who actually have a chance to win, don't drink from 
the same trough as the unwashed. 
</P>
<P>
 They have separate bottles containing concoctions such as "flat" Coke or Green 
Magma, a mixture of water and young barley leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Magma men are the ones who finish the race looking like a salad. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The greatest strategy in the race does not involve the pacing of the 
runners, but where they place their special bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 There are six elite water stations, where tables are in the middle of the road 
instead of on the side. Runners mark their bottles, and water station workers 
arrange them in a predetermined order. Except sometimes the volunteers get the 
order wrong, like last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronquillo noticed this at his station just as the runners appeared on the 
horizon. "We had everything backward, I had two minutes to rearrange 30 
bottles," Ronquillo recalls. "I have never moved so fast in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 -- A couple was once married during the race at the Mile 13 station.  
</P>
<P>
 -- A runner can get soaking wet at a water station and never go near the 
table. This happens when the runner ahead of him takes a mouthful of water and 
then spits it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get downwind of some of those guys and you get drenched," says Jerry 
Dunn, a massage therapist who ran a record 104 marathons last year and will 
compete Sunday. "But you know, depending on what kind of day it is, that's all 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Theresa Matthew, who has worked Mile 25 for years, remembers the woman who 
stumbled on despite a first-aid worker's advice that she stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "This woman wanted to get that last mile, so I figured I would help her," 
Matthew recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew took the runner's pulse while she was still running. Together, they 
jogged together toward the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 Both women, over 60. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't even want to know how hard that can be. Marathon Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Clarification: South African-born Mark Plaatjes was not listed among American 
winners of the L.A. Marathon in Friday's Sports section because his victory in 
1991 came before he acquired U.S. citizenship. However, Plaatjes did win the 
world championship as an American in August, 1993, three weeks after becoming a 
citizen.

HARDING ATTACKED IN PARK; FIGURE SKATING: SHE SUFFERS SPRAINED WRIST. POLICE 
NOT TREATING IT AS RANDOM. HER APPEAL TO POSTPONE USFSA HEARING IS DENIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One week after Tonya Harding fizzled in the XVII Winter Olympics by finishing 
eighth, she has returned to the public consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, under investigation for her alleged role in the Jan. 6 assault on 
rival figure skater Nancy Kerrigan, told police she was attacked while walking 
through a park in Beaverton, Ore., late Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 It was yet another twist to the two-month saga that also included Friday's 
decision by the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. to deny Harding's appeal to postpone 
a disciplinary hearing scheduled for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, a two-time Olympian, said she was attacked from behind by an 
assailant as she walked toward an apartment complex where she is staying with 
her best friend, Stephanie Quintero. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are investigating the case as if it were not a random attack. They 
refused to name any suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, 23, suffered minor bruises and a sprained wrist. She was treated at 
Kaiser Sunnyside Medical Center and released. 
</P>
<P>
 With her left wrist wrapped in a bandage, she talked briefly with reporters 
camped outside the apartment where she stays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm feeling OK," Harding said. "Can't you guys get a life or something?" 
</P>
<P>
 Harding was visibly upset and suffering an asthma attack when officers arrived 
at the residence after the assault, police said. Rescue personnel gave her 
oxygen. She was able to talk only after taking asthma medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 A police report said Harding told officers that she was pushed from behind. 
After struggling, she activated a personal security system that emits a loud 
scream, which scared away the assailant, believed to be male, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Webber, Quintero's father, told reporters: "She's survived a lot of 
other things. This is just another thing that she'll survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Webber said Harding's injuries were minor. He said they would not prevent her 
from competing in the World Figure Skating Championships, which begin on March 
22 in Chiba, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 But a USFSA panel could alter those plans if it finds that Harding violated 
the organization's code of ethics. The group is meeting Thursday in Colorado 
Springs, Colo., to determine her status. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel is expected to meet for at least two days, during which time 
Harding's attorneys will be allowed to cross-examine witnesses, said William 
Hybl, panel chairman. Harding could be suspended from the association. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding's attorneys, who successfully stopped the U.S. Olympic Committee from 
suspending Harding before the Lillehammer Games last month, are trying to 
secure her place in the world championships by forcing the panel to postpone 
its hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing was ordered last month after it was determined that there were 
reasonable grounds to believe Harding was in violation of the USFSA's code for 
her involvement in the Kerrigan assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding's ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, has pleaded guilty to racketeering in 
connection with the attack. He also has implicated Harding. Shawn Eckhardt, 
Harding's bodyguard, was arrested for his role in the attack and also named 
Harding as a conspirator. Harding has denied that she knew about the attack 
beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harding's attorneys claimed that she did not have enough time to prepare 
for the hearing, that the panel was not impartial and that the proceedings 
would prejudice her position in a criminal investigation against her. 
</P>
<P>
 A Portland, Ore., grand jury is expected to deliver its final report on March 
21, a day before the world championships. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Dept. also is considering whether Harding violated federal laws in 
connection with the Kerrigan assault. John Russell, a spokesman for the 
criminal division, said a review was initiated two weeks ago at the request of 
local prosecutors.

THE BILLIKEN BRIEF; CHARLIE SPOONHOUR ISN'T SINGING THE BLUES AT ST. LOUIS, 
WHICH IS HAVING ONE H OF A SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kevin O'Neill, Marquette's basketball coach, steers his four-wheel drive 
through the slush of the parking lot, finds a space and then points Charlie 
Spoonhour toward the front door of the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I swear, Charlie, we'll be in and out in 15 minutes," O'Neill says to the St. 
Louis coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Spoonhour nods. He has a sore throat and the Billikens' game against Marquette 
starts in less than three hours. But a promise is a promise, and Spoonhour told 
his buddy O'Neill that he would say a few words at the weekly booster 
breakfast. Anyway, O'Neill could use the help. Relations between the locals and 
the Marquette coach are, uh, a little tense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as long as I'm back to the hotel by 11," Spoonhour says, his Arkansas 
drawl contrasting with O'Neill's Upstate New York accent. 
</P>
<P>
 So here he is, coach of the nation's unlikeliest 16th-ranked team, stuck in a 
German restaurant as Marquette boosters, many of them wearing little adhesive 
tags that read, Hello, My Name Is . . ., chow down on sausages the size of 
water balloons. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the pregame cholesterol fest, Spoonhour, 54, is introduced to 
the crowd. Forks and knives fall silent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, y'all, I'm not going to get up here and make fun of Kevin," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 And he doesn't. Instead, he gushes 
</P>
<P>
 about Marquette's tough schedule, about Marquette's many victories, about 
O'Neill. To listen to him, you wouldn't know that St. Louis was on its way to 
its first NCAA tournament appearance in nearly 40 years, or that the Billikens 
began the season with 14 consecutive victories, or that white-haired Charlie 
was one of the better kept secrets in college basketball, a coach-of-the-year 
candidate if ever there has been one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will look like a father-son game when we get out there," Spoonhour says to 
the boosters, who have forgotten all about their mounds of eggs. "We got a 
player -- Donnie Dobbs is his name -- and he's a 6-3 1/2 power forward . . . 
which is just what everyone in America is looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," he says, "we got him." 
</P>
<P>
 Spoonhour decides to work the room a bit. So he pulls out some of the A-minus 
material, which means a visit to Rocky Comfort High in Missouri, where 
Spoonhour made his coaching debut 34 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rocky Comfort isn't much of a city," he says. "There's no businesses, just 
one big ol' school. There was an opening for a coach and I got the job. I 
believe it was because I was the only applicant. 
</P>
<P>
 "First day of school and I'm living in a 8 x 28 pink trailer by the home-ec 
cottage. That was part of the deal. All of a sudden I hear this banging on the 
door. I stagger out of bed, open the door and it's pitch black outside. The 
school supervisor is standing there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'What time is it?' 
</P>
<P>
 "He says, 'About 6 a.m.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thinking, 'Six a.m.? I don't even throw up till noon.' So I ask him, 
'What time does school start?' 
</P>
<P>
 "And he says, 'We start at 8:20, but you're driving the bus.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So Spoonhour drove the bus, even though he didn't know how to operate the 
clutch. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were yelling at me as I went down the road, 'Hey, Fatty, grind a pound 
out for me, too.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the boosters are slapping their knees by now. This Spoonhour fellow is 
sort of interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reba Westfall was the principal at Rocky Comfort," Spoonhour is saying. "Now 
you got to remember that the folks in Rocky Comfort weren't the most 
sophisticated in the world. They ate a lot of vanilla wafers and drank milk 
through a straw. One time Reba got one of the parents real mad at her, so the 
parent started saying, 'A spell . . . a spell on Reba Westfall.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I didn't know any better, so I asked what the spell was for. Turns out 
Harold's momma put a spell on Reba because Reba flunked Harold in biology. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I ask, 'Anything happen to Reba?' 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'Not much. She limped a little.' 
</P>
<P>
 "So I say, 'Is Harold gonna play basketball?' 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'Prob'ly.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I say, 'Well, then he's a starter because I'm not fixin' to limp.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And with that, Spoonhour thanks the crowd, puts a final public relations plug 
in for O'Neill ("I hope you 'preciate what your team is doing.") and then takes 
a seat. A few minutes later, Spoonhour and O'Neill are quick-stepping it out 
the restaurant, into the four-wheeler and back to the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks, Charlie," O'Neill says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't you worry about it," Spoonhour says. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that day Marquette hands St. Louis its first loss of the season. 
Spoonhour doesn't seem too upset. He didn't figure the Billikens would go 
undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth is, he didn't figure on any of this. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two seasons ago, the Billikens were 5-23 and finding new and exciting ways to 
lose games and fans. Then along came Spoonhour, fresh from a nine-year reign at 
Southwest Missouri State, which might not sound like much until you look at his 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 Victories: 18- 17- 24- 28- 22- 21- 22- 22- 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Conference championships: four. 
</P>
<P>
 NCAA appearances: five. 
</P>
<P>
 NIT appearances: two. 
</P>
<P>
 He could have had the Wyoming job, but he changed his mind at the last moment. 
He was interested in the Kansas opening a few years back, but the offer went 
elsewhere. "The guy they've got has done fair," Spoonhour said of Jayhawk Coach 
Roy Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 As for St. Louis, Spoonhour isn't quite sure why he's there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," he said with a shrug. "Like most things, it seemed like the 
thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, his team has a 22-3 record and he is a local celebrity, all thanks to a 
lineup that includes a point guard -- former Nevada Las Vegas player H Waldman 
-- who is as tall as the power forward Dobbs . . . and a center, 6-8 Evan 
Pedersen, who isn't really a center at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Waldman is used to winning national championships and Dobbs, 
despite his size, is averaging about 16 points and six rebounds. The Billikens 
also have guard Erwin Claggett, who averages about 18 points and, according to 
Marquette's O'Neill, is one of the five best players in the difficult Great 
Midwest Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the roster could use some work, but no one seems to mind. Fire 
marshals look the other way whenever the Billikens have a home game. St. Louis 
Arena, capacity 18,000, is nearly filled to the rafters whenever "Spoonball" -- 
that's what they call it at the school -- is being played. 
</P>
<P>
 "They get a standing ovation for blowing their nose," said a slightly envious 
O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
 Spoonhour has his own TV show and spends more time on the airwaves than Bob 
Costas. So numerous were the radio talk-show requests earlier this season, that 
Spoonhour finally asked, "Doesn't anyone else in this town talk?" 
</P>
<P>
 They do, but for the moment Spoonhour is the one they listen to. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't ask Spoonhour how he did any of this, because he says he doesn't have a 
clue. Honest. He got lucky with Waldman's transfer. Dobbs, his first recruit at 
St. Louis, was a junior college player who was leaning toward Pacific. 
Claggett, Pedersen and forward Scott Highmark were leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have a big plan," Spoonhour said. "We didn't know what we were 
getting ourselves into." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not entirely true. For instance, Spoonhour knew he wanted the 
undersized Dobbs. Spoonhour had been recruiting him to come to Southwest 
Missouri, but now he wanted Dobbs to reconsider schools. 
</P>
<P>
 So he called and told him so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Donnie," he said, "I'm going to St. Louis. I'm calling you from the side of 
the road to tell you that." 
</P>
<P>
 "Naw, Coach, you're not on the side of the road," Dobbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Dobbs listened and when he did, he heard the traffic noise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach," he said, "I'm coming." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis won 12 games during Spoonhour's 1992-93 rookie season, but it was 
enough to spark some interest in the program. The Billikens finished 51st in 
average NCAA attendance, 8,591, which was better than UCLA, Georgetown or 
Pittsburgh, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, St. Louis is averaging about 13,000. At last check, there had 
been four sellouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Spoonhour, no dummy, padded his nonconference schedule this season with the 
likes of Mercer, Cornell, Chicago State, Augustana, Samford, Creighton and, at 
the time, undermanned Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 Better yet, he finally had Waldman available. Waldman, who played on UNLV's 
1990-91 NCAA championship team, gave St. Louis a player accustomed to winning, 
to top-25 rankings, to NCAA tournaments, to bright lights. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's kind of flamboyant," Spoonhour said. 
</P>
<P>
 Waldman used to infuriate Spoonhour with his mistakes. It got so bad that one 
day Spoonhour yelled, "Dammit, H, that isn't Larry Johnson on the end of that 
pass." 
</P>
<P>
 Waldman has toned down his showmanship, but not his pregame intensity. Even 
now his teammates marvel at his ability to focus on a coming game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call him Preparation H," Dobbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a good way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spoonhour sits near the hotel bar and sips a cup of coffee. His throat still 
hurts, but that doesn't keep him from telling stories. 
</P>
<P>
 As always, there is Rocky Comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first volleyball game I ever saw, I coached," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spoonhour taught English, drove a bus and coached four sports. He even helped 
direct the junior class play. 
</P>
<P>
 He did all that for $4,280 a year. He lived in that pink trailer and one day 
discovered the work of an incompetent electrician. 
</P>
<P>
 "I turned the shower on and when I woke up I was on the bed," he said. "The 
guy had it wired incorrectly and nearly electrocuted me. So I had to turn my 
shower on every day with a broom handle." 
</P>
<P>
 And if he forgot? 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd get a real shock," he said. "This would be like (Jack) Nicholson in 
'Cuckoo's Nest.' That's about how I looked. You're sitting on the bed, wet, 
wondering what happened to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Spoonhour still is wondering how any of this happened. From Rocky Comfort to 
the top 25 in only 33 years. Imagine.

A NIGHT FOR SEEING STARS BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE RING; BOXING: DE LA HOYA 
AND THREE OTHER UNDEFEATED FIGHTERS WILL REOPEN THE OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM IN GRAND 
STYLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The building is 70 years old and Oscar De La Hoya is 21, but both are looking 
forward to making a fresh start tonight when the lights go up and the bell 
sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Both have undergone renovations in the last four months: Since Nov. 1, the 
Olympic Auditorium has received $5 million in improvements after years of 
neglect; De La Hoya has absorbed and then tried to erase the stain on his 
pristine public image left by a bitter battle to separate himself from his 
former managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, De La Hoya makes his first world title challenge (albeit for a minor 
title) at the Olympic when he faces Jimmi Bredahl of Denmark, the World Boxing 
Organization junior-lightweight champion, in the featured bout on the Olympic's 
first major card in nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 In the co-feature, James Toney will defend his International Boxing Federation 
super-middleweight title against No. 1 contender Tim Littles. 
</P>
<P>
 All four fighters are undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya, 11-0 with 10 knockouts, has had trouble in the past even coming 
close to the 130-pound junior-lightweight limit, but he surprised himself and 
his trainer, Robert Alcazar, with his quick weight loss during training the 
last seven weeks at Big Bear City. 
</P>
<P>
 Although De La Hoya has never fought at less than 131 as a professional, he 
was confident enough about his weight that he apparently did not rigorously 
protest the Bredahl camp's request to have the WBO weigh-in moved from Friday 
night to this morning at 8 a.m., giving De La Hoya less time to recover if he 
has trouble making the limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's weird, now that I'm at weight, I feel stronger than I used to at 136 to 
140," De La Hoya said. "I've been surprising myself and surprising everyone. 
I'm going to show that 130 is no problem for me, and I'll probably stay at that 
weight for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time off came at a perfect time for me. I had a few problems with my 
managers, and the pressure was getting to me. I kind of had to refocus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I feel great. I don't feel rusty at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Promoter Bob Arum, whose 25-fights-a-year commitment to the Olympic enabled 
the old palace to reopen, promises an auditorium full of old fighters and 
celebrities tonight as he seeks to evoke a sense of the building's glory days 
and of its potential future. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I remember about the Olympic is that I'd better put on a good fight," 
said De La Hoya, whose father, trainer and grandfather all fought in the 
building. "The fans are all really knowledgeable fans, and they get mad if you 
don't really get in there and fight." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time De La Hoya fought was Oct. 30 in Phoenix, when he knocked out 
Narciso Valenzuela in the first round after being knocked down himself 30 
seconds into the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days before his next scheduled fight, Dec. 9 in New York, De La Hoya 
split from his managers and scuttled the bout. So, De La Hoya has fought less 
than one round since his August knockout of Angelo Nunez in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of De La Hoya's $1-million purse from tonight's bout will go toward his 
settlement with former managers Steve Nelson and Robert Mittleman. The $600,000 
buyout will be completed when Nelson and Mittleman receive $100,000 from De La 
Hoya's next purse. 
</P>
<P>
 Bredahl, 16-0 with five knockouts, has maintained a smiling confidence 
throughout this week in Los Angeles, and at Thursday's news conference, he 
handed De La Hoya an invitation to Bredahl's planned victory party tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Bredahl, who trained for this fight in Houston, won the championship in 
September, 1992, but has fought only once outside Denmark and never before in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know he's a good boxer, a good technician, but he has no power," De La Hoya 
said. "I'm not thinking that I'm going to walk right through him, but he will 
not beat me." 
</P>
<P>
 Bredahl's camp will collect a purse of $300,000 for this fight.  
</P>
<P>
 With a national audience watching on HBO, De La Hoya said he knows he has 
something to prove in the ring -- and outside it. For reasons beyond any belt, 
this might be the most important fight in his 16-month professional career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to show that (the management crisis) did not affect me whatsoever," De 
La Hoya said. "I'm still the same person, I'm still the same guy that came out 
from the Olympic Games with a gold medal. Nice person and everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because I split up from my managers, there's been a few bad publicity 
things. But I'm sure that after a few fights, people will just forget about all 
that and remember again what Oscar was." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya and his camp concede that the WBO is not a major title, but stress 
it is only a starting point for him. Arum is setting up a potential showdown 
with Sylmar's Rafael Ruelas, the newly crowned International Boxing Federation 
lightweight champion, possibly for next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand certain organizations have more influence than others, but it 
all depends on who's in there," Alcazar said. "With Oscar representing (the 
WBO), they have the opportunity to be as big as the others." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, De La Hoya said: "I see it as just another fight. It's just my first 
fight at 12 rounds, and I'm defending my undefeated record."

SANTA CLARA FALLS TO VERBUM DEI; HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL: MILLER SCORES 32 AS 
THE EAGLES WIN THEIR FIRST CHAMPIONSHIP SINCE 1979. CANTRELL HAS 37 FOR SANTA 
CLARA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After Verbum Dei High defeated Santa Clara, 71-65, and made the customary dog 
pile at center court Friday night, two very good basketball teams lined up to 
receive team awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section Division IV-A championship game, if nothing else, is a 
celebration of months of hard work and a great team effort. 
</P>
<P>
 But the concept of team played a secondary role in this game at UC Irvine's 
Bren Events Center. Santa Clara's Damian Cantrell scored a career-high 37 
points. Verbum Dei's Andre Miller finished with 32 and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Cantrell and Miller, both of whom will be playing in college next year, at 
times appeared to be playing one-on-one in a dim, musty gym. They slapped hands 
before the game. They burned each other with moves. They altered each other's 
shots. Each player was oblivious to the noisy crowd but fully aware he had to 
contain his man for his team to have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was blowing by me in the first half," said Cantrell, who saw Miller 
explode for 24 points while making nine of 13 shots, including four 
three-pointers.  
</P>
<P>
 Miller was a dribbling, jumping, smirking, showboating sight to see. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles (24-2) led at halftime, 44-34.  
</P>
<P>
 But Cantrell, a poker-faced hustler, answered the bell in the second half with 
21 of his 37. 
</P>
<P>
 Cantrell buried a three-pointer from the perimeter, then dusted Miller with a 
spin move and a bank shot to pull the Saints (19-8) to within a point. Then 
Cantrell hit a running layup with five minutes to play to give Santa Clara a 
59-58 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took it to me," Miller said. "He wasn't afraid to play. Most guys back 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 But then Miller stepped up. With the Saints leading, 61-59, the 6-foot-2 
senior drove for a layup that gave Verbum Dei a 62-61 lead, one it wouldn't 
relinquish. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-break layups by Deon Williams (12 points) and Jamal Cobb (17 points) 
increased the lead to 66-61 with two minutes to play. Santa Clara hurt its 
cause when Jess Pena (10 points) missed a finger roll and Damien Smith botched 
an open layup. 
</P>
<P>
 But the officials also missed, when Miller apparently palmed the ball with 
1:56 to play. Verbum Dei didn't score on the possession but took 57 seconds off 
the clock, thanks to the non-call. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get some breaks on some calls when we should have while we were 
trying to play catch-up," said Santa Clara Coach Lou Cvijanovich, whose record 
in section championship games fell to 13-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had 20 field goals, they had 20 field goals. So it went to the free-throw 
line. Where else would (the difference) be?" 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara attempted only nine free throws, making seven. The Eagles were 13 
of 19. The Saints held Verbum Dei to 29% shooting from the field in the second 
half after the Eagles shot 52% before the intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cvijanovich: "I know when we were down by 10, a lot of people in the 
grandstands thought we were finished." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara is not finished. It has an automatic berth in the Southern 
California regional, which starts Tuesday.

RAMS MAY TAKE LOOK AT FAVRE; PRO FOOTBALL: GREEN BAY QUARTERBACK IS GIVEN A 
"CONDITIONAL" $20-MILLION, FIVE-YEAR CONTRACT OFFER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 John Shaw, Ram executive vice president, said Friday the team has made a 
"conditional" $20-million, five-year contract offer to Green Bay quarterback 
Brett Favre. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's conditional on whether we decide to bring him here next week for a 
visit," Shaw said. "We haven't invited him yet, but we told his agent that if 
we do, it will be to try and sign him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, however, are not expected to invite Favre here next week. They are 
working hard to sign Atlanta quarterback Chris Miller, and while they will meet 
with Phoenix quarterback Chris Chandler Monday, Miller has been moved to the 
top of the team's wish list. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know about Chris Miller," said Bus Cook, Favre's agent. "But we 
believe we have an offer from the Rams. It's not a written offer, but obviously 
the Rams know an offer has been made. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about the offensive setup there and Brett is looking forward to 
playing in that system." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook said Friday that he not only expects Favre to visit Rams Park next week, 
but that the family has met, discussed the team's offer and has pronounced it 
agreeable. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook said the Rams' offer includes annual base salaries of $3 million plus a 
$5 million signing bonus. The signing bonus, Cook said, is prorated over the 
length of the contract at $1 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook told the New Orleans Times-Picayune that the Rams had presented Favre 
with an offer sheet and that the offer had been verified through the NFL 
office. However, Cook said Friday that the Rams had not yet put their offer in 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "An offer has been tendered, but we don't have a written offer," Cook said. 
"We still have to get down to the finer details, but the numbers they offered 
us are very much in the ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook denied that he's using the Rams to force the Packers or the Saints, who 
met with Favre recently, into making an offer for Favre. He said Favre is 
sincerely interested in the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously it helps us that there's numbers out on the table, numbers that we 
have been looking for," Cook said. "But Green Bay has not made an offer yet and 
New Orleans made an offer for Bubby Brister. We're looking at the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't set a date for coming there, but we're supposed to call the Rams 
Monday." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox said, "We're still in the process of evaluating the 
quarterbacks and that process has not been completed. We have some other 
quarterbacks coming in next week." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will look at Chandler, and have talked about meeting with Brister. 
They have also been in contact with Kansas City quarterback David Krieg. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams tendered an offer sheet to Favre and the Packers opted not to 
match it, the Rams would have to surrender their first- and third-round 
selections in next month's NFL draft. In addition to losing two top picks in 
the draft, the team would have to spend a great deal of money for Favre's 
services, thereby causing problems under the NFL's new salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller will come cheaper to the Rams and cost them nothing in draft picks. 
Miami quarterback Scott Mitchell was offered $3.2 million a year by Minnesota, 
and the Rams aren't sure he has recovered sufficiently from a shoulder injury 
to warrant such money. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all depends on whether we are interested in Miller, Mitchell or Favre," 
Shaw said. "I don't know where Chuck's mind is right now and where we're going 
with the quarterbacks. I would expect the coaches to tell me what makes the 
most sense for us to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we decide to bring Favre here, and assuming he passes the physical and 
gets along with everybody, we would try to sign him. But we're just not sure 
we're going to invite him out." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Zygmunt, Ram senior vice president, left Anaheim Thursday night for 
Northern California to meet with Frank Bauer, Miller's agent. The team would 
like to look at Chandler before signing Miller, but Ram officials did not rule 
out the possibility that a deal might be done this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams did not have Miller high on their list of prospective quarterbacks 
because they expected him to fail the team's physical examination. Miller, 
however, not only passed the exam, but left physicians impressed with his 
recovery from a pair of surgical procedures on his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams met with Kansas City linebacker Lonnie Marts Friday, and the team is 
expected to make a financial pitch to the outside linebacker next week.

MORNING BRIEFING: MOST KIDS WOULD BE HAPPY IF THEY GOT AN OLD BARRACUDA

 A teen-ager in Carpinteria, casting about for a new name, has reeled in a 
golden one: Trout Fishing In America. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Eastman Jr., 17, wanted to do something different for his graduation 
from Carpinteria High this year, so last week, he went to Superior Court to 
legally change his name to Trout Fishing In America, a name inspired by Richard 
Brautigan's 1967 counterculture classic, "Trout Fishing in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Trout Fishing: The Associated Press noted: "It figures the teen-ager would 
come from a community locals call Carp." 
</P>
<P>
 His father supported his son's decision, but said he was sad that the family 
torch has been passed to a fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "My God, our family name has history," the elder Eastman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who won the first Santa Anita Handicap? 
</P>
<P>
 Enough is enough: According to a survey by the Opinion Research Corp. of 
Princeton, N.J., one of six Americans videotaped portions of the the 1994 
Olympic Winter Games. Figure skating was the most popular with 85% of the 
videotaping audience. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the closing ceremony had concluded, 54% had recorded more than 
four hours of the action. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard life: Caught On The Fly, the caustic Sporting News column, isn't 
impressed by the spring training work of Dodger relief pitcher Todd Worrell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who says baseball players aren't athletes?" Fly wrote. "Todd Worrell, tryin' 
to come back from injuries, pitches battin' practice last week, then refuses to 
take grounders on the mound. Says glass-fragile Todd: 'I was just tired. Ten 
minutes of B.P., it's harder than it looks.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Too much smoke: Dan McGhee, athletic director and basketball coach at Loraine 
(Tex.) High, has been fired for violating the school's no-smoking policy. He 
had been suspended since December after being caught smoking in his office in 
the gym on a Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in New England: This is how Michael Arace of the Hartford Courant began 
his story after the Boston Celtics lost their 13th consecutive game: 
</P>
<P>
 "BOSTON -- Like Hemingway's Santiago, the title character in 'The Old Man and 
the Sea,' the Boston Celtics staggered home from a long trip and collapsed. 
Like Santiago, they now wonder whether men can be defeated but not destroyed -- 
and vice versa." 
</P>
<P>
 What a thought: From Phil Jackman of the Baltimore Sun: 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine how our stock would soar around the world if we could send a team 
full of Bonnie Blairs to the Olympics, winter and summer. Her quip, 'It took 
Eric Heiden a week to win five gold medals, it took me six years,' is a 
classic." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Azucar, on Feb. 23, 1935.

 Quotebook: Mac O'Grady, when told about Deane Beman's resignation as PGA Tour 
commissioner: "It can't be what Bill Murray said ('He's just another screwhead 
too big for his britches'), because I've been saying the same thing all along. 
My vote for the next commissioner goes to Murray because the tour needs some 
humor." SHAV GLICK

 Vlade Divac had seen this kind of thing from his friend before, back when he 
and Dino Radja were teammates for seven years on the Yugoslav national team. 
</P>
<P>
 So what transpired Friday night at Boston Garden, when they were opponents, 
came as no surprise, though that didn't make it any easier to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was too much," Divac said. "Dino won the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Not single-handedly, considering Dee Brown scored 14 of his 22 points in the 
critical fourth quarter, but close. 
</P>
<P>
 All Radja did was score 36 points and grab 15 rebounds, both game highs, to 
earn Boston a 109-99 victory over the Lakers in front of the 14,890 fans who 
celebrated the Celtics' first win since Jan. 30 and the end to a 13-game losing 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "With about eight minutes left in the third quarter, the leprechaun was still 
sleeping," Laker Coach Randy Pfund said. "But he woke up, obviously. That 
leprechaun must look a lot like Dino Radja. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried everything right down the line: (Elden) Campbell, we tried Kurt 
Rambis, Danny Schayes, George Lynch, Vlade. Nobody could handle him. We doubled 
him, and that caused problems on the boards." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Radja, who made 15 of 22 shots: "When a couple went in, it's easy. You 
just feel relief of any pressure. And they kept putting a small man on me, and 
you can't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers' smallest man, Nick Van Exel, kept Celtic defenders just as busy. A 
game after making five three-pointers to tie a team regular-season mark for the 
third time, he hit for six for the record and 26 points. Michael Cooper also 
had six, in the 1987 finals against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I was going to be on tonight," said Van Exel, who went so far as to 
predict to color commentator Stu Lantz that the record would fall. "The basket 
seemed so big. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a rookie and breaking a record like that, it's pretty nice." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers shot only 41.5%, with George Lynch making two of 12 and James 
Worthy five of 13. Divac made seven of 17, but that was good enough for 19 
points to go with 11 rebounds, his fifth consecutive double-double.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL; MOVIE SMACKS OF COASTAL CAROLINA'S BERGMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON MARKUS, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those who have seen "Blue Chips" usually come away thinking that Pete Bell, 
the coach portrayed by Nick Nolte, is really Bob Knight. In temperament and 
tactics, perhaps, but in terms of art imitating life, this movie smacks of 
Bergman. Russ Bergman. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, after the embattled Coastal Carolina coach went to see the movie with 
his team in Blacksburg, Va., the night before its Feb. 12 game at Radford, he 
called Steve Vest, sports editor of the Myrtle Beach, S.C. Sun-News, the next 
morning to admit to paying for plane fare home for two players. 
</P>
<P>
 "My crime was that I just wasn't smart enough to make something illegal 
legal," Bergman said. 
</P>
<P>
 By chance, Vest had gone to see the movie the same afternoon and had written a 
column drawing parallels between Bergman's 19-year career at Coastal Carolina 
and Bell's career. Vest's sympathetic conclusion might have inspired Bergman to 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the end of the column, I threw in a line about 'What if a year from now it 
turned out that he was more a victim than a villain?' " said Vest, who along 
with his staff had been writing for six months about alleged infractions at the 
Big South Conference school. 
</P>
<P>
 While Bell had turned suddenly from a Knight clone into Jerry Tarkanian -- 
both of whom made appearances in the movie -- after his first losing season, 
Bergman's transgressions allegedly have been going on despite Coastal 
Carolina's continued success. The Chanticleers had gone to the NCAA tournament 
two of the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the NCAA violations that Bergman admitted, there are allegations of 
academic fraud, free hotel rooms for players and too many visits by recruits in 
1992. Not quite buying a house for a player's mother, stuffing wads of cash in 
athletic bags or providing a recruit with a luxury automobile, but potential 
major infractions nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you build a program that's so used to winning, you create a monster," 
said Bergman, who has been at the Conway, S.C., school during its evolution 
from NAIA to Division II to Division I the past seven years. "I can honestly 
say that I have not had any trouble sleeping." 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic director Andy Hendrick, who also serves as a municipal judge in 
Conway, initially ruled five players ineligible -- including star forward 
Mohammed Acha of Nigeria, one of the two who received plane fare home -- and 
later reinstated three. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hendrick and university president Ronald Eagin announced last week that 
the team has been withdrawn for this week's Big South tournament, which begins 
Friday in Charleston, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergman was expected to resign -- or get fired -- following his team's final 
regular-season game, but so far has remained in the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Nick Nolte's interested. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 After attending the 1978 Final Four championship game between Duke and 
Kentucky, two aspiring Division I women's coaches named Lewis Bivens and Andy 
Landers vowed to see a game on the Blue Devils' home court, Cameron Indoor 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bivens never got around to it, as his career took him from a high school 
job in Tennessee to NAIA Carson-Newman to Middle Tennessee State. Nearly three 
years ago, when he was paralyzed for eight months after surgery to dissolve a 
blot clot in his leg caused several blood vessels in his spine to rupture, 
Bivens made a list of things he wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
 After walking again and coaching again -- Bivens coached the next season in a 
wheelchair and last season with the help of a cane -- that left three other 
wishes. One was to visit a foreign country, which he did with a recruiting trip 
to Australia. Another was to play golf at Pebble Beach in California. Both were 
accomplished last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The final wish was to see a game at Cameron, which he fulfilled last Sunday 
after Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski found out about Bivens' request. Bivens had a 
seat right behind the Temple bench and one of his favorite coaches, John 
Chaney, whose book he read and whose principles he tries to get his teams to 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering that I wasn't supposed to be here, and certainly not walking, I'd 
say I'm pretty fortunate," said Bivens, who can walk up to two miles at a clip 
but still has problems with his balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Landers, now the coach at Georgia, is pretty upset. Bivens took his 
16-year-old nephew to Cameron. He even got to meet Temple fan Bill Cosby, who 
sat at the press table next to the Owls bench. "I've been to five Final Fours, 
and nothing could compare to the atmosphere there," Bivens said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 An interesting union has taken place at Clemson, where Wayne Buckingham and 
Jessica Barr have announced their plans to marry later this year. Buckingham, a 
senior on the men's team, has the lowest scoring average of any starter in the 
Atlantic Coast Conference. Barr led the ACC women's players in scoring and was 
named ACC Player of the Year Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a match made in heaven," Buckingham said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the match came about because of bad knees. Barr had been injured 
before transferring to Clemson from Georgia, and met Buckingham after he 
sustained a torn anterior cruciate ligament in the first game of the 1991-92 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 While Barr's career has blossomed, Buckingham's never really got going due to 
problems with the injury and earlier ineligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll never know what kind of player Buck could have been," said outgoing 
Clemson coach Cliff Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The coaching merry-go-round has gotten off to an early start this year with 
the announced resignations of Ellis and Wade Houston at Tennessee, as well as 
the announcements that Paul Evans at Pitt and Jim O'Brien at Dayton, among 
others, won't be back, speculation has started about who will fill which 
coaching jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The rumors surrounding Les Robinson getting fired at North Carolina State are 
heating up again following the Wolfpack's devastating home loss to Florida 
Atlantic last week. If Robinson gets fired, look for N.C. State to make a 
strong run at Seton Hall's P. J. Carlesimo.

NBA ROUNDUP; ROBINSON, STRICKLAND ARRESTED; PORTLAND WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cliff Robinson and Rod Strickland seemed none the worse for wear after a long 
night with a McDonald's truck and the Chicago police. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson scored 18 points, Strickland had 16 points and 11 assists and Clyde 
Drexler scored 27 points as the Portland Trail Blazers won their eighth game in 
their last nine, 115-96, at Chicago, where the Bulls lost their fourth in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson and Strickland were arrested early Friday after a pushing-and-shoving 
match with a truck driver in a downtown McDonald's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble apparently began with a minor traffic accident about 4 a.m. that 
led to an argument, Chicago Police Lt. Patrick Logan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Strickland and Robinson were charged with simple battery, a misdemeanor, and 
released after posting $100 bond. They face an April 27 court date. The 
unidentified truck driver was not charged. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a total misunderstanding," Robinson said. "We were hungry. We wanted 
something to eat at McDonald's. A guy backed into us, and then the whole thing 
got blown out of proportion." 
</P>
<P>
 There was little reaction from the Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're disappointed they were out that late, but there is no team curfew. 
They're adults," team spokesman John Christensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 106, Minnesota 101 -- Cedric Ceballos scored 29 points at Phoenix and 
the Suns kept their mastery over Minnesota. Phoenix is 20-0 against the 
Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 126, New Jersey 110 -- Derrick McKey scored 24 points at Indianapolis 
and the Pacers won their fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 98, Orlando 89 -- Reggie Williams scored all 20 of his points in the 
second half at Denver to lead the surging Nuggets, who won for the sixth time 
in their last eight games. Anfernee Hardaway had 23 points to pace the Magic.

DUCKS STAY IN THE HUNT, 4-1; HOCKEY: VICTORY OVER OILERS SETS UP KEY GAME 
AGAINST SHARKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Has it really gotten to this point, that the Mighty Ducks can have must-win 
games? 
</P>
<P>
 That's pretty much what Friday night's game against the Edmonton Oilers was -- 
the sort the Ducks have to win if they're serious about making a run at the 
playoffs in their first season. 
</P>
<P>
 They needed to win it, and they did, 4-1, before a 17th consecutive sellout of 
17,174 at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Guy Hebert made 24 saves, four players scored goals and defenseman David 
Williams tied his career high with three points on a goal and two assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big win," said Joe Sacco, who scored his seventh goal in the last 
eight games. "It's huge, it gives us some momentum going into the San Jose 
game, and we haven't played very well against them." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonton, the last-place team in the Pacific Division, had lost to San Jose 
the night before, and the Sharks extended their lead over the Ducks and Kings 
to five points -- at least for a day. 
</P>
<P>
 A loss to Edmonton would have been demoralizing for the Ducks -- and would 
have sent them into Sunday's game at San Jose needing to win to avoid falling 
seven back in the scramble for the eighth and final Western Conference playoff 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they have an opportunity to cut San Jose's lead to one point. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ron Wilson is looking at the San Jose game as another must-win. It is 
their final meeting of the season with the team they are chasing -- and the 
Ducks are 0-5 against the Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 The game against Edmonton was a penalty-filled one that included rare 
overlapping five-minute major penalties against the Ducks. That meant a two-man 
advantage for the Oilers for 3:35, and the Ducks came within 10 seconds of 
killing it off before Fredrik Olausson's goal gave them a 1-0 lead at 16:13 of 
the first. 
</P>
<P>
 The long five-on-three power play came after Stu Grimson was given a charging 
major for barreling into Edmonton goalie Bill Ranford outside the crease, and 
then Don McSween got a high-sticking major and automatic game misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Dollas tied the score at 18:56, with a slap shot from the right point. 
Tim Sweeney scored the go-ahead goal from close range at 5:39 of the second 
after Terry Yake's second-effort pass came to him across the crease as Yake was 
being pushed away from the play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a strange game, there wasn't much flow," Wilson said. "I think we were 
a little nervous. We're starting to realize the importance of every game right 
now."

NHL ROUNDUP; CLARK MOVES MAPLE LEAFS INTO TIE FOR FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Toronto Maple Leafs are used to working a little extra when they play 
their Central Division rivals, the Detroit Red Wings, so Friday was nothing 
new. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fourth time in less than a year, including two playoff games, the 
Maple Leafs won at Detroit, 6-5, in overtime on Wendel Clark's third goal of 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 It moved the Maple Leafs into a tie with the Red Wings for first place in the 
East, though Detroit has a game in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Clark's second hat trick in as many games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've been very lucky," said Clark. "They have a great, great hockey 
club, and we have to play our best just to compete with them. This is a great 
rivalry." 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver 4, Dallas 1 -- Pavel Bure scored his 39th goal as the Canucks won at 
Dallas and denied goaltender Andy Moog his 300th victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Winnipeg 6, Ottawa 1 -- Nelson Emerson triggered a five-goal second-period 
outburst with his 25th of the season as the Jets won at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 3, Philadelphia 3 -- Garry Galley's second goal of the game, with 
1:07 to play in regulation, enabled the Flyers to salvage a tie at Landover, 
Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford 2, Florida 1 -- Todd Harkins' first goal of the season led the 
Whalers at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo 2, Pittsburgh 1 -- Craig Muni's short-handed goal in the second period 
proved to be the game-winner at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Islanders 3, New York Rangers 3 -- Derek King's second goal of the 
game lifted the Islanders into a tie at Madison Square Garden.

BOXING; MCCLELLAN KNOCKS OUT BAPTIST IN 97 SECONDS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gerald McClellan is slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
 It took him 97 seconds to stop Gilbert Baptist in defense of his World Boxing 
Council middleweight title Friday night at the MGM Grand. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first defense, last Aug. 6, McClellan knocked out Jay Bell in 30 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "He caught me," Baptist, 30, of San Diego said of McClellan. 
</P>
<P>
 Again and again, and it didn't take long. The first knockdown came 10 seconds 
into the fight.

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; TONEY'S MOOD BODES ILL FOR LITTLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Toney is in a good mood, which, as those around him know all too well, 
is not something to be wasted. 
</P>
<P>
 He obligingly signs autographs at a table, chats with everybody who approaches 
him, then politely allows a reporter to direct him to a quieter place to talk. 
</P>
<P>
 No glowers, no menacing motions, none of those tense emotional moments in and 
outside the ring that the International Boxing Federation super-middleweight 
champion is famous for providing. 
</P>
<P>
 You seem happy, somebody says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in an angry mood right now," Toney says, instantly frowning. "I'm just 
putting up a front." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he laughs, because on this day he feels so happy he can't even feign ill 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, Toney is not in a good mood, which is something those around 
him know all too well. 
</P>
<P>
 He is at a news conference and eyes his opponent, Tim Littles, with 
uncompromising disdain. Toney strides up to the podium and tosses Littles a 
cheap leather belt, saying that it's the only belt Littles will ever have. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Toney wanders back to his seat, where he raises his IBF title belt high, 
and the look on his face is not fake. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is tremendously moody," says Toney's manager, Jackie Kallen, who has seen 
her fighter become embroiled in a handful of far uglier moments at news 
conferences. "He's actually beyond moody. His moods are like everything else 
about him, very extreme." 
</P>
<P>
 To quell his roiling emotions, Kallen keeps Toney extremely busy -- this will 
be his 14th fight since February 1992 -- and he never stops training. That way, 
Kallen says, he can stay focused on all of his many goals. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days leading up to tonight's fight against Littles at the Olympic 
Auditorium, Toney, who is 41-0-2 with 26 knockouts, has said he was not looking 
past Littles, 24-0 with 15 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Littles is a smooth, slip-and-slide boxer from the Lou Duva-George Benton 
camp, who says Toney might get knocked out in the later rounds. But Toney, 
known for his relentless, wear-them-down-then-punish-them style, just shakes 
his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Even boxing's recent, bizarre run of upsets -- overturning, among others, 
Julio Cesar Chavez, Terry Norris, Michael Carbajal and Michael Nunn -- does not 
knock him off course. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all in your mind," Toney says. "But I'm unstoppable. I'm not taking Tim 
Littles lightly, he's undefeated, he has a good record. I can't wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt I'm the best, pound for pound. I've beaten the best. I'm 
active. Pernell Whitaker hasn't fought in eight months (actually six), 
everybody says he's the best? Chavez, he got what he deserved. He got beat when 
he finally fought somebody with some heart and some skills. Terry Norris. 
Michael Carbajal. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "So there's only one guy left: Me. I know I'm the best. There won't be any 
letdown. My head isn't big. I just know I'm good." 
</P>
<P>
 Does Toney feel disappointed that Norris, one boxer he badly wanted to fight, 
lost to Simon Brown before Toney could meet him? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel bad at all," Toney says. "His loss is my gain. I get more 
popular every day. Everybody has seen who is the real champ and who's not." 
</P>
<P>
 Toney, 25, foresees a bright future unfolding for himself in the next few 
years: a showdown with IBF middleweight champion Roy Jones in the fall, a bout 
with Chris Eubanks after that, and then his big move into the light-heavyweight 
division as he prepares to rumble toward the heavyweight class. 
</P>
<P>
 Toney has fought at weights far above the 168-pound super-middleweight limit 
several times, but says his immediate goal is to dispose of any worthy 
opponents in the middleweight divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "My motivation right now is Roy Jones," Toney says. "I'm obsessed with him, 
I've got to have him, I don't like his pretty-boy image." 
</P>
<P>
 A Jones fight could get Toney the multimillion-dollar purse that so far has 
eluded him. And although he could legitimately question why a fighter with his 
record is on Oscar De La Hoya's undercard tonight, he seems content with his 
progress.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you're the best fighter, pound for pound, which I am, you've got to stay 
busy in front of the public," Toney says. "I'm not the type of person who's 
going to wait for the $2-million payday like everybody else does. Keeps me 
sharper, too. That's all I want to do, fight."  
</P>
<P>
 Kallen says she never has to worry about Toney taking an opponent lightly -- 
his desire to stay champion is too great. Though Toney at times looks sluggish 
in the ring, Kallen says it's only because he knows he's going to win and wants 
to avoid a freak injury or cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "James is the type of guy who would rather die than lose," Kallen says. "I 
seriously worry that if he ever lost a big fight, I don't know what he would 
do. He's got so much pride, and I think it would just shatter him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope he'll continue to win, and he'll retire undefeated and he'll be a 
fulfilled human being." Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Mercedes, who suffered serious head injuries Tuesday night at the 
Forum, is "doing super," according to Dr. Robert Karns, and should be 
discharged from Cedars-Sinai Hospital today. Karns reports that 98% of the 
blood that leaked into Mercedes' skull from a burst vein is gone. Also, an 
ophthalmologist found no problems with Mercedes' eyesight -- either from 
potential brain damage or the broken eye socket suffered in the fight against 
Cecilio Espino. . . . Three-time champion Alexis Arguello, 41, who last fought 
in 1987, is making a comeback and has signed with Orange County-based manager 
Jim Browning. Arguello was recently examined by a doctor who, Browning said, 
described Arguello as having "the body of a 20-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar De La Hoya is sporting an inch-long scrape above his lip, acquired while 
sparring -- and not while using the shaving cream he now endorses, De La Hoya 
said with a laugh. . . . Lou Duva, on De La Hoya's career: "They're marketing 
him, not making him a better fighter. If he was any kind of fighter, he'd be 
fighting (World Boxing Assn. junior-lightweight champion) Genaro Hernandez or 
(International Boxing Federation champion) John-John Molina. And if he did 
fight them, either one would run him out of the ring. He hasn't fought anybody 
who isn't handpicked." . . . Duva on the Tim Littles-James Toney fight being on 
the De La Hoya-Jimmi Bredahl undercard: "Hey, Toney's had more fights than both 
of them combined, and my guy is a great fighter. This should be the main event, 
no question." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Needleman, Olympic Auditorium chief executive officer, on the work it 
has taken to get the building ready: "When we first started this back in 
November, I don't think we recognized the scope of what we were actually doing. 
My comparative (project) lately has been the MGM Grand (in Las Vegas). When it 
opened, they had a few problems. I hope to have as few as possible. I really 
don't see that there's that much to go wrong."

EDBERG OBVIOUSLY NOT FINISHED YET; INDIAN WELLS TENNIS: SWEDE EASILY DISPOSES 
OF CAHILL TO REACH SEMIFINALS AGAINST SAMPRAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stefan Edberg won $2,309,509 in 1993, reached the semifinals in 10 tournaments 
and finished the season ranked among the top five in the ATP Tour rankings for 
the ninth consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 For him, it was a bad year. 
</P>
<P>
 The gentlemanly Swede won only one tournament, failed to win a Grand Slam 
event for the first time since 1989 and, after winning the U.S. Open in each of 
the previous two years, lost in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hinted that his priorities had changed after the birth last July of his 
daughter, Emilie, and that the former No. 1 player was no longer motivated, no 
longer driven to reach the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Edberg, 28, silently steamed and set out to show that he still had a few good 
years left, still had a Grand Slam event title in him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to show that I can still play tennis," he said Friday after blowing 
past Darren Cahill of Australia, 6-1, 6-3, in 62 minutes to move into the 
semifinals of the Newsweek Champions Cup at Hyatt Grand Champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Edberg, seeded third, will play top-seeded Pete Sampras, who needed 73 minutes 
to defeat eighth-seeded Thomas Muster, 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 The other semifinal will match 10th-seeded Petr Korda of the Czech Republic, a 
6-3, 3-6, 6-3 winner over Carlos Costa, and unseeded Aaron Krickstein, who 
defeated Alexander Volkov, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Edberg's sub-par year did not catch him totally off guard, he said, but that 
didn't make it any more enjoyable for a player who has won six Grand Slam 
titles and ended both 1990 and '91 as the world's No. 1 player. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to come a time where you're going to lose track a little bit 
because you cannot stay up there forever," he said. "(But) it's sort of hard to 
face yourself (when you) start losing matches, start missing shots that you 
normally wouldn't miss if you were playing well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to adjust mentally. Instead of making semifinals, finals, I was 
losing third round, quarterfinals, and I wasn't beating the top players. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Once you start losing to guys that maybe you shouldn't lose to, it makes you 
start thinking a little bit. Other players realize they have a chance, and you 
get down a little bit on yourself, lose a bit of confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps fatherhood was too much of a distraction? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to tell," Edberg said. "It possibly could have happened without me 
having the baby last year. It was going to happen sooner or later. You have to 
make adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost track a little bit. I didn't enjoy myself as much as I should. Maybe I 
was a little bit more tense." 
</P>
<P>
 This year has been different. 
</P>
<P>
 He has already won two tournaments and reached the semifinals at the 
Australian Open before losing three tiebreakers against Todd Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, he hasn't lost a set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel pretty hungry this year," he said. "I feel now for the first time in 
quite some time that I'm actually playing good tennis. I mean, really good 
tennis." 
</P>
<P>
 Edberg tuned out the whispers that he was over the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know within yourself what you're capable of doing," he said. "And I knew 
last year was tough, but I knew I wasn't quite finished. I still have a couple 
more years where I can play good tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really think about getting back (to No. 1) because it's extremely 
tough. It's not impossible, but I see myself winning another Slam and staying 
on top of the game because I can definitely stay in the top five. And if you're 
up there, you always have chances to win tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love competing, so that's why I keep going."

GOLF / SENIOR PGA TOUR AT OJAI; LITTLER STILL SWINGING, TRAILS COLBERT BY THREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was 40 years ago that a slender youngster with the sweetest swing this side 
of heaven came out of San Diego to make a name for himself in professional 
golf. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Littler will be 64 in July but despite illness, injury and numerous 
surgeries, he still has that sweet swing. 
</P>
<P>
 In only his third tournament since rotator cuff surgery nine months ago, 
Littler fired a five-under-par 65 Friday in the opening round of the $550,000 
GTE West Classic at Ojai Valley Inn & Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a strong finish by Jim Colbert prevented Littler from holding at least a 
share of the lead. Colbert birdied four of the last five holes, posting a 62, 
eight under. That tied the tournament record and gave Colbert a three-shot 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 A blast out of the sand trap into the cup on 18 capped a sensational finish 
for Colbert. 
</P>
<P>
 Tying Littler for second place were Jim Albus, Dick Rhyan and Larry Laoretti. 
Four, including 1993 player of the year Dave Stockton, are at 66. Arnold Palmer 
is in a group of eight at 67. A bad break on the 487-yard 18th, where his 
second shot buried itself in the trap on the right of the green, kept Palmer 
from being a shot closer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really hitting the ball well," Palmer said. "I had chances to have a much 
better round. I feel good about my game and maybe I'm getting close to playing 
like the younger set." 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion Al Geiberger, playing with the same partners as when he 
shot his record 59 at Memphis in 1977 -- Dave Stockton and Jerry McGee -- 
didn't play with that kind of inspiration and didn't come close to a 59. His 73 
left him 11 shots back and made it doubtful he can repeat as champion. 
Stockton, though, shot better than his 76 in 1977, coming in with a 66, four 
behind the leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Littler was surprised at his performance, which included five birdies and 
no bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't play that well," he said. "I made a couple of good putts and 
my wedge helped me out of some problems. It would be a real surprise if I won 
this thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. (Frank) Jobe said it would be at least a year before the shoulder stopped 
hurting. Just before Christmas I had arthroscopic surgery on my knee. But the 
worst problem for three years has been an aching back. I've had to make some 
adjustments in my swing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sure would be nice to be back in the interview room Sunday, though." 
</P>
<P>
 It shouldn't really be a surprise that Littler is playing well again. He has a 
history of comebacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The most notable was from skin cancer in 1972. He won five of his 29 
tournaments on the regular tour after recovering and went on to a brilliant 
career in the 50-and-over group. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I had cancer in 1972, it was the first for anyone on tour," Littler 
recalled. "I wasn't thinking of playing golf again. The question I asked was, 
'How long do I have.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Littler said that on Christmas Day he called Paul Azinger, the regular tour 
player who is recovering from cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just called to give him encouragement and tell him how it was for me," 
Littler said. "I never met Paul, but he sounded upbeat and I learned he is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought that the recent problems would keep me from playing, but I 
didn't expect to make it back this fast. I played in the first two senior 
events in Florida, but my best score was 71 and best finish 34th." 
</P>
<P>
 It was in the spring of 1954 that Littler, 5 feet 9 and 150 pounds, won the 
San Diego Open as a 23-year-old amateur. He turned pro later that year and won 
the L.A. Open in 1955. Later he won the Tournament of Champions three 
consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
 Colbert, whose allergy problems weakened him late last year, said he is 
feeling strong again. 
</P>
<P>
 "My swing is back and now it seems my putting touch is, too," Colbert said. "I 
made putts down the stretch of 25 feet to save par, then eight, 12 and 17 for 
birdies." Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
 George Archer, who had a hole in one in the Chrysler Cup last week, hit a 
two-iron 201 yards into the cup on the 11th hole Friday. "The four-iron last 
week was the longest ever until today," Archer said. "It went out of my sight, 
but by the crowd reaction I figured it was close. I guess the next one will be 
with a wood." . . . Gene Littler leads the Vantage Classic, the tournament 
within a tournament for the 60-and-older set, by three shots over Charlie 
Sifford. Sifford, 71, shot a 68, the first to shoot under his age on the senior 
tour this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because this is probably the last year for the seniors here, the 
biggest first-day crowd, estimated at more than 15,000, was on hand. The start 
of the round was delayed for an hour because of fog.

 Mickelson, a left-hander from San Diego, broke his left leg Thursday at 
Arizona Snowbowl, near Flagstaff, when he hit some ice, causing him to lose 
control and crash into a tree.

 A pin was inserted from below the hip to above the knee, but Mickelson won't 
need a cast, said Steve Loy, his agent.

MAINE'S STATUS NOT RELEVANT TO KARIYA SIGNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Kariya's option of returning to the University of Maine to try to lead 
the team to a second consecutive NCAA championship is apparently gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Maine was barred from the Hockey East conference playoffs Friday -- and thus 
from qualifying for the NCAA playoffs -- because of an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Kariya is no closer to joining the Ducks, said Mighty Duck 
General Manager Jack Ferreira, because talks with Kariya's legal adviser are 
"at an impasse." Ferreira said he believes Maine's fate is "immaterial" and 
that a financial agreement has always been the only obstacle to Kariya joining 
the Ducks this season. He says the sides are far apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know where they want to be," said Ferreira, who is believed to have offered 
a deal in the neighborhood of $3.45 million for four years, plus performance 
bonuses. "We didn't close the door, but I can't see anything happening." 
</P>
<P>
 If Kariya, drafted fourth overall in June, doesn't sign now, the Ducks will 
retain his rights for two years. ROBYN NORWOOD

SACCO KEEPING DUCKS IN HUNT WITHOUT KARIYA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe the Mighty Ducks will sign Paul Kariya next week, maybe they won't sign 
him until August. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Joe Sacco will keep firing the puck on net, taking on the role as 
the Ducks' hottest goal-scorer gladly and without reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no sense worrying about what might happen with Kariya, the Ducks' No. 
1 draft pick, Sacco said after a 4-1 victory over the Edmonton Oilers on Friday 
at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows the Ducks could use the extra offensive punch Kariya could provide 
down the stretch. After all, Sacco had a keen interest in the Olympic Games, 
what with his brother, David, playing on the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard he's a great player and I'm sure if he comes he would help our 
team," Sacco said of the high-scoring Canadian Olympian. "But we can't get 
caught up in that. We can't worry about it. It's management's decision." 
</P>
<P>
 So Sacco keeps plugging away, doing his part to keep generating goals for the 
grinding Ducks in their hunt for the Western Conference's eighth and final 
playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 His third-period, power-play goal on a pretty feed from defenseman Mark Ferner 
put Friday's game out of reach. It also was Sacco's seventh goal and 10th point 
in the past nine games. He has been held pointless only four times in that 
span. 
</P>
<P>
 If he's feeling the pressure of the playoff chase, it's not showing. 
</P>
<P>
 In practice Thursday, Coach Ron Wilson tried to hammer one thought into his 
players' heads: Enjoy the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we should feel the pressure, but we do," Sacco said after 
scoring his 14th goal of the season. "We have to approach it as if we don't 
have to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that that's an easy task at this time of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so close," Sacco said of a playoff berth. "At the end of the year, there 
is pressure (to make the playoffs). It's attainable. It's reachable. The coach 
is trying to take the pressure off by saying we don't have to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, first-year teams aren't supposed to make the playoffs, but what would it 
mean if the Ducks did? 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be unbelievable," Sacco said. "A great feeling."

UCLA'S BENNETT ARRESTED FOR FORGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA defensive back Tommy Bennett was suspended from the football team by the 
athletic department Friday after his arrest by campus police on forgery 
allegations and an unrelated traffic offense. 
</P>
<P>
 A search warrant was served on Bennett, a sophomore, at his Saxon Suites 
residence on campus Thursday morning, and sufficient evidence was obtained to 
arrest him on forgery charges, according to Lt. Jim Kuehn of the UCLA police. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point we're not releasing the nature of the evidence because the 
investigation is still ongoing," said Kuehn, who added that the case is 
expected to be turned over to the Santa Monica district attorney next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett was booked at the West Hollywood sheriff's station and released on his 
own recognizance. Arraignment is scheduled for March 24 in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehn would say only that "more than one document" has been found, that "it 
was for monetary gain" and that no one else was involved. He added that there 
is a possibility of more than one charge. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be as many as six, Kuehn said, adding, "but that is speculation." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said he preferred to "lay low" until charges are sorted out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't want to comment on anything until I talk with my lawyer," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, from San Diego, is suspended until an investigation is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett started the Bruins' first game, a 27-25 loss to California, and 
intercepted a pass, but he struggled with his assignments and was demoted. 
</P>
<P>
 He then played as an extra defensive back in passing situations until a 40-27 
victory over Washington State, which he started at free safety when Travis 
Collier was injured.

COACH BUTCHER'S TEAM IS READY FOR 1,163-MILE IDITAROD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To put her situation last year into perspective for the mainstream sports fan, 
dog-musher Susan Butcher used a comparison: 
</P>
<P>
 "In many ways, part of my job is being coach of nothing different than a 
football or basketball team, and last year I simply . . . had the Celtics -- 
too many old ones and not enough young ones in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher believes she has the perfect mix entering this year's Iditarod Trail 
Sled Dog Race, which begins today in Anchorage and ends in about 11 days, and 
1,163 miles later, at Nome. 
</P>
<P>
 But to win her fifth Iditarod -- she won in 1986, '87, '88 and '90 before 
finishing fourth last year -- Butcher will require good fortune as well as good 
dogs, as there will be 57 other mushers, including defending champion Jeff King 
of Denali Park, Alaska, and five-time winner Rick Swenson of Two Rivers, 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very good, but expect there's quite a few other people feeling quite 
good, too," she said. PETE THOMAS

SWIMMING / PAC-10 FINALS; STANFORD STAYS AHEAD OF PACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Stanford men's swim team continued to dominate the Pacific 10 Conference 
championships at the Belmont Plaza Pool in Long Beach on Friday, winning six of 
seven events and increasing its lead over second-place UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford has accumulated 696 points, 276 ahead of UCLA and 324 ahead of 
third-place USC with today's six events remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The only event the Cardinal failed to win Friday was the 100-yard butterfly, 
won by Arizona's Martin Pepper in 47.60 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinal took first through fifth places in the 200 freestyle. Sophomore 
Joe Hudepohl retained his Pac-10 title, finishing in 1 minute 35.67 seconds. It 
was Hudepohl's second individual title of the meet. He won the 50 free Thursday 
night. Stanford's Derek Weatherford also won his second title, the 100 
backstroke in 46.92, the fastest time in the nation this season.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / WCC TOURNAMENT; TITLE COULD BE TAKEN BY ALMOST ANY TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It comes as no surprise that most West Coast Conference basketball coaches 
consider the conference tournament title, and the NCAA tournament berth that 
goes with it, up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that the last-place team beat the champion and that nearly half of 
the regular-season games were won by five points or fewer, separating the haves 
from the have-nots has become difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly believe that any of the eight teams has a shot at winning the 
conference tournament," Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves (16-10), who needed a late-season surge to tie San Francisco for 
second place, will play the second game today, about 2:30, against 
seventh-place St. Mary's (13-13). Pepperdine has a 12-game winning streak 
against the Gaels. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego (15-10) plays Portland (13-16) in the tournament opener at noon, 
champion Gonzaga (20-6) plays last-place Loyola Marymount (6-20) at 6 p.m. and 
San Francisco (16-9) plays Santa Clara (13-13) about 8:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine has played in the last three tournament finals, winning titles in 
1991 and 1992. But the most successful team in tournament history -- 13-4 in 
seven seasons -- did not look like a contender three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 During a rocky stretch, the Waves lost three games in a row and five of seven, 
falling into a sixth-place tie with Loyola. A disgusted Asbury benched his 
starting guards, Damin Lopez and Bryan Parker, at the start of a game at 
Gonzaga on Feb. 10, the second of two consecutive losses to the Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves haven't lost since, however. They start the tournament with a 
four-game winning streak, their longest of the season and currently the longest 
of any WCC team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've played a little better as of late, that's an encouraging sign," Asbury 
said. "We've shot the ball a little better and we've turned the ball over a 
little less." 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Dana Jones and Lopez have led the resurgence. Jones, a 6-foot-6 
forward, averaged 19.5 points, 11.5 rebounds and shot 72% last week in road 
victories over St. Mary's and Santa Clara. Lopez, a 5-9 guard, has improved his 
outside shooting and leads the WCC with 86 three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola's fortunes, on the other hand, have taken a turn for the worse. After 
winning four of five games during a stretch that included upsets of Pepperdine 
and Gonzaga, the Lions ended WCC play with five consecutive losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been shorthanded most of the year and our kids are physically worn 
down," Coach John Olive said earlier in the week. "I (gave) them a couple of 
days off. Hopefully that will help." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Santa Clara started the tournament on a hot streak and upset 
regular-season champion Pepperdine in the final before going on to stun Arizona 
in the first round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament semifinals are set for Sunday starting at 5 p.m., with the 
championship game to be televised nationally by ESPN at 9 p.m. Monday.

 Michael Jordan made his much-awaited debut in a major league exhibition game 
for the Chicago White Sox at Sarasota, Fla., and in his only at-bat, chopped a 
ball back to the pitcher and was tagged out. He played four innings in a 9-0 
loss to the Texas Rangers, and had only one play in right field, picking up a 
double and making a one-hop relay to the infield. . . . The Pittsburgh Pirates 
need an emergency bailout of $8 million during the next year to stay in 
business, Mayor Tom Murphy said.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; YOUNG GUNS PLEASE LASORDA IN OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been a long time since Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda had a team with so 
much young talent, and he is enjoying it. He throws 100 curveballs to 
outfielder Raul Mondesi and works with pitcher Greg Hansell on his curveball 
almost every day. Lasorda can't begin to count the pitches he has thrown to 
catcher Mike Piazza and first baseman Eric Karros for extra batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
 So Friday, when Karros had two hits, Mondesi hit a towering home run and 
shortstop Jose Offerman, who agreed to a $2.115-million, two-year contract 
Thursday, drove in three runs during the Dodgers' 6-1 exhibition victory over 
the New York Mets, Lasorda was more than pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked what I saw today," Lasorda said after the exhibition season opener at 
Port St. Lucie, Fla. "The players have really worked hard all spring and they 
are ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after breaking his left cheekbone, second baseman Delino DeShields 
went through a full workout without a problem. He is scheduled to have 
outpatient surgery Monday to pop the bone back into place and said he should be 
playing in exhibition games in about a week. DeShields was struck by a bat that 
slipped from Mike Busch's hands during batting practice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks good now, but when it happened, I looked like a pit bull," DeShields 
said. "I blacked out at first, and when I came to, I couldn't see and that 
scared me. But then my vision cleared up. I am very fortunate -- if it hits me 
a touch higher, it gets my eye. And if it hits back a bit and hits my temple, 
well . . . the doctor said I was fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Astacio, who signed for $325,000 Thursday, was cleared to play after 
testing for a heart murmur. He returned to light drills and is expected to 
pitch Monday. . . . Minor leaguer Roger Cedeno, a top outfield prospect, had 
arthroscopic surgery in Los Angeles on his left knee, which he injured while 
sliding during winter ball. . . . Right-hander Todd Williams, the Dodgers' top 
reliever in their farm system, will have an MRI examination to determine the 
cause of elbow pain that has sidelined him since the beginning of winter. . . . 
Ramon Martinez will start today against the Florida Marlins in the Dodgers' 
second exhibition game, at 10 a.m. PST. MARYANN HUDSON

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; IT'S A GRAND-SLAM START FOR BO JACKSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The murmur began the moment he left the on-deck circle and had built to a 
crescendo by the time he reached the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Designated hitter Bo Jackson stepped into the batter's box with the bases 
loaded Friday at Tempe, Ariz. The Angels were trailing by four runs in the 
eighth inning. The situation was made for a grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, whose flair for the dramatic has helped make him one of America's 
greatest sports heroes, watched Colorado rookie Marc Pisciotta throw three 
consecutive balls. There was no doubt in his mind what was coming next. 
</P>
<P>
 Pisciotta fired, and Jackson swung, sending the ball over the right-field 
fence, and the Angels into a frenzy. The score was tied and, moments later, the 
Angels beat the Rockies on Eduardo Perez's two-run single, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bo knows dramatics," Angel Manager Buck Rodgers said. "That's why you pay 
some guys $5 million and some guys $500. The minute I saw the ball, I just 
looked at the flagpole and waited for it to land. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know if we're seeing the tail end of his first career, or the 
beginning of his second one, but it's going to be fun to find out." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Angel coaching staff has three more weeks to decide whether 
Jackson will make the team, owner Gene Autry might have influenced the decision 
when he strolled into the clubhouse. He came only to meet Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's this man that I tried to sign (in 1985)?" Autry said, extending his 
hand. "That was wonderful today. Hopefully, you'll be doing the same thing in 
six months." 
</P>
<P>
 Autry started to walk away, and Jackson grinned, turned around and said, "So, 
does this mean (I have) a job?" 
</P>
<P>
 Little wonder that Chili Davis, last year's designated hitter, walked into the 
clubhouse, looked at Jackson and said, "So tell me, where am I going to be 
traded to, Cleveland?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Langston was touched for five hits and two earned runs in two innings 
Friday but said he threw no breaking balls. "I learned a lesson in my second 
spring with Seattle," Langston said. "I threw a breaking ball on every 3-2 
count. The next 10 days I had severe pain in my arm. That was it for me. . . . 
The Angels put pitcher Julio Valera on the 60-day disabled list. He underwent 
reconstructive elbow surgery last July 8 and is expected to miss the season.

<P>
 Trying to stave off streaking Stanford, Pacific 10 leader USC will play UCLA 
tonight at 7 in a key women's basketball game at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Cheryl Miller's Trojans, 20-3 overall and 13-2 in the conference, have 
three games left and are being hotly pursued by the Cardinal (19-5, 12-3) and 
Oregon (18-6, 12-3). 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins (15-9, 10-5) are hoping to reach the NCAA tournament, to atone for 
a 15-point loss at USC on Feb. 4 and to show they aren't a one-player team.  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's star, Natalie Williams, went out with a season-ending knee injury in 
the first half last Saturday at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Bruins played on even terms with the Cardinal, which had routed 
the Trojans, 80-50, two nights earlier. Surprisingly effective without 
Williams, UCLA lost, 94-82, after closing within eight points in the second 
half.  
</P>
<P>
 Stanford won its eighth straight game Thursday, beating Oregon State, 81-60, 
at Corvallis. The Cardinal plays at Oregon tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 After the blowout at Stanford, Miller in effect predicted a national 
championship this season for her Trojans, saying: "From this night on, we are 
not going to lose again and I'm not just talking about the conference." 
</P>
<P>
 USC, which finishes its season next weekend at home against Oregon and Oregon 
State, will be led tonight by senior Lisa Leslie and freshman Tina Thompson, 
who are averaging a combined 35 points and 22 rebounds a game. EARL GUSTKEY

SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; NOW, MONARCHS MUST LOOK TO NEXT 
LEVEL WITH HOPES OF GETTING EVEN

 There was no free trip to Disneyland for the winners, and no year's supply of 
Turtle Wax for the losers. 
</P>
<P>
 What was there? A plaque and the understanding there is another basketball 
tournament to be played. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Buena's 50-41 victory over Mater Dei Friday gave the Bulldogs the 
Southern Section Division I-A girls' basketball title. 
</P>
<P>
 With the victory, they will be one of the top four seeded teams in the 
eight-team Division I Southern Regional, which is the next step toward a much 
bigger prize -- the State title. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's where Mater Dei's focus is now, after being swallowed up in a sea 
of blue inside the Ventura College gym. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs have one of the largest girls' basketball followings in Orange 
County, but Friday, the 300 red-clad fans were outnumbered by about 1,400 
supporters of the defending I-A champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's worth about 10 points to play the game here," Mater Dei Coach Mary 
Hauser said. "Our kids have never been (in this situation). 
</P>
<P>
 "Next week in Anaheim, it would be a different situation; then we'd have 5,000 
Mater Dei fans and a thousand Buena fans." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what it will be like if the Monarchs can take the next step. They'll 
have to win two games next week and, like Friday, will have to travel. But 
there's a chance the two teams could meet again. So Hauser wasn't dwelling on 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our team all year rebounded from losses really well," she said. "It seems 
like the losses propelled us to do well." 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei wasn't overwhelmed, and had it not been for a three-point play at 
the end of the first half and a three-point basket at the beginning of the 
second, Friday's outcome might have been different. 
</P>
<P>
 "You make a run," Hauser said, "then they hit a bucket and they take the umph 
out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Melody Peterson said it is possible for Mater Dei to make a run at the bigger 
prize. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can come back even stronger," she said. "Every team has its day." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday was Buena's. The Bulldogs weren't playing for just a championship but 
for back-to-back titles for the first time. They have been to the final five 
consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no noticeable tears from Mater Dei players after the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the kids to get back on track and realize there is a bigger goal, the 
State championship," Hauser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Buena's Eboni Conley, a sophomore who has been part of two championship 
teams: "I think we could see them again."

BOYS' BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES; IN A FAIRY TALE POSTSEASON, EDISON FACES 
REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the beginning of the season, Edison Coach Larry Hirst said he was just 
minding the store.. . . He never anticipated this blockbuster opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-eight games ago, Hirst embarked on his head coaching career at Edison 
by taking over for Jon Borchert, who was on a "sabbatical" from basketball, 
Hirst said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hirst watched his star player, Micah Kroeger, sprain his ankle before he 
played his first game for Hirst. He watched his team finish tied for fourth in 
the Sunset League. 
</P>
<P>
 But after defeating Ocean View in a fourth-place playoff to automatically 
qualify for the playoffs, Hirst and the Chargers have put together an 
improbable run, leaving them one victory away from a Southern Section Division 
I-A championship. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so it's one improbable upset away because Edison's opponent is USA Today's 
No. 2-ranked team in the nation, Mater Dei (30-0). 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:30 tonight at Anaheim Arena, top-seeded Mater Dei, the team with 
Arizona-bound guard Miles Simon and freshman sensation Schea Cotton, figures to 
keep Edison (20-8) a Division I-A finalist and non-champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will take a near flawless performance for us to pull off an upset," Hirst 
said. "We don't match up well anywhere with them." 
</P>
<P>
 "But this whole experience has been really neat. It's the first time the 
school has been to a Southern Section final in basketball, and it's like you 
wish you could stop everything, just for a day, so you can keep experiencing 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 A flawless game might not be enough for the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look at tonight's matchups: 
</P>
<P>
 Small forward -- Ben Beard, Edison and Cotton, Mater Dei. Cotton is one of the 
most exciting players in the county at 6 feet 5 and he's only a freshman. He 
should be too strong for Beard, an All-Sunset League selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Power forward -- Micah Kroeger, Edison and Darren Hite, Mater Dei. Kroeger is 
the Chargers' top scorer and Hite is one of the Monarchs' best defenders. If 
Kroeger draws a crowd of Monarchs when he sees the ball, his teammates will 
have to make the open jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
 Center -- Ali Tofighi, Edison and Shaun Jackson, Mater Dei. Jackson (6-7, 200 
pounds) is bigger, stronger and quicker than Tofighi (6-5, 190), who will have 
his hands full. 
</P>
<P>
 Point guard -- Chad Baird, Edison and Simon, Mater Dei. Simon (6-4, 170) can 
shoot, pass and dunk with the best in the county. But Simon's pressure defense 
could cause Baird (5-11, 170) the most problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Shooting guard -- Darrell Adams, Edison and Clay McKnight, Mater Dei. McKnight 
made 50% of his three-pointers, Adams 42%. Edge to Mater Dei . . . again. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Edison doesn't match up well with Mater Dei, Mater Dei Coach Gary 
McKnight is still a little leery. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have some good three-point shooters and that's the great equalizer in 
high school basketball," McKnight said. "The one advantage we do have is that 
we've played at the Bren Center before and they haven't played in a big arena. 
It's tough to shoot in arenas." 
</P>
<P>
 But McKnight doesn't want the Monarchs are looking past Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't get to the finals because you're not a good team," McKnight said. 
"Edison just keeps getting better and better as the playoffs have gone on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will our guys be looking past this game? I think once you get out to The 
Pond, see 10,000 people in the stands and feel the excitement, you forget about 
everything else and play hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Edison pulls off the improbable, Hirst could still be out of a head 
coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Borchert said we'd discuss the coaching situation when the season ends," 
Hirst said. "I know I have a lot to learn and if he asked me to be his 
assistant, I'd do it in a heartbeat." Division I-A 
</P>

SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; BUENA GIVES MATER DEI A LESSON IN 
WINNING; DIVISION I-A GIRLS: MONARCHS LOSE, 50-41, AND MUST HOPE FOR AT-LARGE 
BERTH IN STATE TOURNAMENT. 
</P>

<P>
 Breaking into the exclusive, reward-filled world of championship teams is 
often a daunting task, even for the most exciting, talented newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 And while rising teams sometimes stumble in their first pursuit of a 
championship, the trips are definitely worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask the Mater Dei High girls' basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Making their first appearance in a Southern Section title event, the Monarchs 
lost, 50-41, to perennial power Ventura Buena in the Division I-A championship 
game Friday night in front of a crowd of 2,000 at Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't shed tears for the Monarchs; they don't want them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's that old saying that winning is about an attitude, and when you're 
used to winning you keep winning because you know how," Mater Dei Coach Mary 
Hauser said. "Buena's kids are used to the pressure of playing in big games and 
winning big games because they've been here so many times before. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not used to this because this was our first experience in a game like 
this, but we've learned a lot. We've got a lot of young players on our team and 
this will help us in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Monarch sophomore guard Melody Peterson: "We were a little bit 
overwhelmed, but we won't be next time." 
</P>
<P>
 The title is the second in a row for defending champion and top-seeded Buena 
(24-2), and the fourth in school history. Buena, which has appeared in five 
consecutive title games and 10 overall, defeated Thousand Oaks, 44-43, for the 
division championship last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs qualified for the Southern California Regional of the State 
tournament beginning Tuesday. The Monarchs (24-4), who were seeded third in the 
Division I-A playoffs, must wait to see if their season continues. 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast League champion Mater Dei might earn an at-large berth, which will 
be announced Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got a lot of very good young players," Buena Coach Joe Vaughan said 
of Mater Dei. "Our experience helped us, but they have a great team; they'll be 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs' experience was evident from the outset. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena used a precise half-court passing game, which eventually broke the 
Monarchs' concentration and led to one easy layup after another. Buena's 
methodical approach also affected Mater Dei, which prefers a faster-paced game, 
on offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "They definitely scouted us well," Hauser said. "They kept on passing, and 
passing until they had the ball in the right place at the right time, then we 
had breakdowns." 
</P>
<P>
 The key stretch occurred between the last few seconds of the second quarter 
and the early moments of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena sophomore guard Kori Sebek (eight points, five steals) scored on a layup 
as she was fouled by the Monarchs' Michelle Meyers with only three seconds 
remaining in the second quarter. She made the free throw to give the Bulldogs 
their largest lead of the game to that point, 23-18. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs then picked up the defensive pressure, both half court and full 
court, in the opening minutes of the third quarter. Their 9-2 third-quarter run 
was capped by a layup by sophomore guard Eboni Conley (nine points, five 
steals) with 5:18 remaining in the quarter, and put the Bulldogs ahead by 12, 
32-20. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs were unable to get the ball inside to Leticia Oseguera, their 
senior center and leading scorer. Buena limited Oseguera, who averages 18.4 
points, to eight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seemed like there were three people around me every time I had the 
ball," Oseguera said. "It was really hard to shoot with so many people around 
the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs' primary defensive stopper on Oseguera was Michelle Giordano, who 
led all scorers with 18 points. Giordano also ended the Monarchs' attempt to 
rally in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei cut Buena's lead to seven, 44-37, on two free throws by Peterson (10 
points, nine rebounds, five steals) with 2:26 to play. But Giordano scored on a 
layup with 2:15 remaining to put Buena ahead by nine, 46-37, and seal the game.

BOYS' BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES; PACIFICA MUST CUT VEAL OFF; DIVISION 
III-A: HOWEVER, MARINERS DON'T PLAN TO USE GIMMICK DEFENSES AGAINST SAN DIMAS 
GUARD, WHO AVERAGES 30 POINTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Division III-A boys' basketball pairings were announced three weeks 
ago, Pacifica Coach Bob Becker immediately knew there had been a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Dimas might have been given the No. 4 seed, but I knew all along they'd 
be here in the finals," Becker said. "San Dimas has been to the finals two 
years in a row, and until Jeremy Veal leaves San Dimas, they are legitimate." 
</P>
<P>
 Becker and his third-seeded Mariners will find out how legitimate at 9:30 this 
morning when they meet San Dimas for the section championship. 
</P>
<P>
 There seems to be little doubt of Veal's legitimacy; he already has signed a 
letter of intent with Arizona State and he averages 30 points, eight rebounds 
and four assists. So the question will be: Is Veal San Dimas' whole team? 
</P>
<P>
 Becker thinks not. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wouldn't be here with just Veal," he said. "I have never seen one player 
take a team into the finals." 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, Becker said he won't try to stop Veal with a gimmick defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't do a box-and-one," he said. "I have too much respect for their other 
players." 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints' best other player is 6-4 center Jamar Bailey, who averages 15 
points and nine rebounds. Forward Sean Smith also averages in double figures 
(10 points), but San Dimas Coach Gary Prestesater acknowledges that his team 
would be nowhere without Veal. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, he's been a little of everything," Prestesater said. "He's been a 
real team leader. He talks a little more than he used to. For two years, I 
didn't know who he was. He's more confident. I think he knows it's his team 
this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Veal showed off his unselfish play in the victory Feb. 25 over North Hollywood 
Harvard-Westlake. He took only 13 shots but scored 23 points and had seven 
rebounds and eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "He seems to do what we need," Prestesater said. "If everybody's shooting 
well, he's passing the ball and rebounding. If he feels the need to step up his 
scoring, he'll do that. It's been a pleasure to coach him this year." 
</P>
<P>
 And, Prestesater said, a pleasure to watch him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made a move the other night against Harvard-Westlake I haven't seen all 
year," he said. "There have been so many of them. He just keeps getting better 
because he works so hard. If I could have the gym open till 10 p.m. every 
night, he'd be out there. But I just can't stay there that long." 
</P>
<P>
 While Veal has led San Dimas, Pacifica has been led by nearly everyone. Senior 
guard/forward Chris Vlasic is leading the Mariners in scoring (20 per game) and 
Ramon Alliman leads them in rebounding (nine per game), but neither starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker often gets 11 players into the game during the first quarter. That 
depth and the Mariners' run-till-you-drop style has worn down most opponents by 
the fourth quarter. San Dimas, which goes only seven deep, figures to try to 
slow down the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They try to wear you down," Prestesater said. "We don't mind running, but 
we're probably not going to use a lot of people. The key is, we have to break 
their press." 
</P>
<P>
 Another key might be San Dimas' ability to contain Pacifica forward Jon 
Surface, who has emerged as a scorer in the playoffs. After averaging only 12 
points during the regular season, Surface is scoring at a 22-point clip in the 
playoffs, including a 38-point effort against Pasadena Blair. 
</P>
<P>
 "He carried us against Blair," Becker said. "The rest of us slept on the bus 
and never woke up." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for Surface's hot streak is simple. He's finally healthy. Surface 
sprained his right ankle before the season and missed four games. 
</P>
<P>
 "He played hurt this year," Becker said. "He'd get swelling all the way up his 
(right calf) and the bottom of his leg would turn purple. Now he's at full 
strength and playing great." Division III-A

BANNING USES A BIG SECOND HALF TO BEAT GARDENA FOR 3-A GIRLS' TITLE

 Jenille Ramos scored 14 of her game-high 20 points in the second half to lead 
Wilmington Banning to a 47-32 victory over Gardena in the City Section Division 
3-A girls' basketball championship game at the Sports Arena Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Banning led, 19-18, at halftime and increased the margin to 28-24 after three 
quarters behind Ramos' seven third-quarter points. 
</P>
<P>
 A minute into the fourth quarter, Ramos scored on a fast-break layup and a 
three-point basket to give Banning (16-11) a commanding 33-24 lead. Gardena 
(17-7) never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came out nervous -- we've never been in a place like this -- but we got to 
halftime and I said, 'OK, we got the jitters out, now we can get it going,' " 
Banning Coach David DeLaby said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardena never got its offense going in the second half, in part because of 
Banning's pressure defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was Gardena's first time in the finals for either boys' or girls' 
basketball," Gardena Coach Cheryl Nakata said. "So we're proud regardless."

HENSON'S 29 POINTS PACE BASSETT TO A 77-73 VICTORY OVER ST. PAUL

 Robert Henson scored a game-high 29 points before fouling out with 3:21 to 
play as La Puente Bassett High defeated Sante Fe Springs St. Paul, 77-73, in 
the Southern Section Division IV-AA championship game at UC Irvine's Bren 
Center Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassett (16-12) won its first-ever section title, but the victory did not come 
easily.Before the Olympians knew what hit them, they trailed, 21-9, late in the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very concerned," Henson said. "We had to pick up our defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Henson, a 6-foot-5 senior, led the charge back as Bassett outscored St. Paul, 
13-2, and took a 42-37 lead by halftime. Henson scored 16 of his 22 first-half 
points in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmery Thompson led Bassett in the second half, scoring 17 of his 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
 After trailing by 14 going into the fourth quarter, the Swordsmen cut their 
deficit to 72-71 with 1:19 to play. But Bassett hit five of seven free throws 
in the final minute to clinch the title.

 Ventura Buena 50, Santa Ana Mater Dei 41 -- Center Michelle Giordano scored a 
game-high 18 points to lead Buena (24-2) to its second-consecutive Southern 
Section Division I-A championship in front of about 2,000 at Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena opened the third quarter with a 9-2 run to take a 12-point lead. Mater 
Dei (24-4) could draw no closer than seven points after that.

 Shannon Burton scored five points and Kimberly Howse added four in the second 
overtime to give Crenshaw High a 75-68 victory over Roosevelt in the City 
Division 4-A championship Friday at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Howse, who also scored four points in the first overtime, finished with a 
team-high 19 points as Crenshaw (22-5) won its second consecutive City 
title.The Cougars defeated North Hollywood in last year's championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We play a lot of games when we started off rough," said Howse, a six-foot 
senior. "But once it gets into the second half, it's all over. We could have 
gone into five overtimes, we weren't going to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt (21-2) had sent the game into overtime by outscoring the Cougars, 
10-1, in the final three minutes of regulation, with Zenobia Tyson-Hunt scoring 
on a turnaround jump shot to tie the score, 60-60. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first overtime, Crenshaw held a 65-63 lead with five seconds remaining 
before Roosevelt's Denise Caudillo tied the score with a layup at the buzzer. 
Caudillo, a three-time all-city performer, finished with a game-high 30 points.

 The Huntington Beach Marina girls' soccer team, ranked No. 1 in the state, won 
the Southern Section Division I championship Friday, defeating Palos Verdes 
Peninsula, 3-0, at Gahr High.  
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave the top-seeded Vikings (28-0-1) their second consecutive 
title.Last season, Marina was co-champion with Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Rubenstein opened the scoring in the 38th minute. The goal came off a 
corner kick after Peninsula had several opportunities to clear the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 In boys' games: 
</P>
<P>
 Claremont 2, Upland 0 -- The Wolfpack's Jason Christensen scored on a rebound 
when Colby Jackson's free kick bounced off the crossbar in the 45th minute.  
</P>
<P>
 The free kick came after Upland goalie Philip Teague was given a red card for 
intentionally taking down Dejan Nagl on a breakaway. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson later scored on a breakaway.  
</P>
<P>
 Claremont is 19-6-4, Upland 21-5-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas 1, Moorpark 1 -- After tying during the regular season, the Frontier 
League opponents tied again in the Division V title game and were named 
co-champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Herbie Sirota scored in the ninth minute for Calabasas (13-3-3).

PRO FOOTBALL; QUARTERBACKS BECOME NFL'S HIRED GUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS MORTENSEN, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Was I dreaming, or did I really hear that . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Miami Dolphins free-agent quarterback Scott Mitchell visited the Minnesota 
Vikings last week. That makes one wonder: What about Jim McMahon? 
</P>
<P>
 That's easy. If Jimmy Mac wants a home, he always can look for Phoenix 
Cardinals Coach Buddy Ryan, who would love to bring in his old friend from the 
Chicago Bears and Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, but then that might leave Steve Beuerlein without a job in Phoenix. No, 
he always can look to the Washington Redskins and his former Dallas Cowboys 
position coach, Norv Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, the Cowboys still need a solid backup for Troy Aikman. Well, the 
Los Angeles Rams' Jim Everett knows the Cowboys' offense, which now is being 
run by Ernie Zampese, the former Rams' coordinator who trained Turner in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams don't need anybody fancy, just efficient. That would describe Bernie 
Kosar. But then you have the Atlanta Falcons' Chris Miller, who wants to play 
for a West Coast team on a grass field. Why not the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
 We need to find a home for Redskins quarterback Mark Rypien, a great guy with 
two tough seasons behind him. He may want to consider an interesting backup 
position with the Los Angeles Raiders. Rypien's specialty is the deep pass -- 
the Raiders go deep all day. And the Raiders know that Jeff Hostetler is a 
rugged quarterback whose reckless style leaves him vulnerable to injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Erik Kramer is signed, sealed and delivered as the Bears' quarterback. So, no 
way are the Bears going to pay Harbaugh $3 million to be Kramer's backup. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbaugh is looking at Indianapolis, where Bill Tobin now runs the football 
operations. In a similar job with the Bears, Tobin made Harbaugh a first-round 
draft pick in 1987. Tobin still loves the guy. 
</P>
<P>
 That may explain why Tobin has been fielding offers for Jeff George. The 
Redskins have called, trying to dump wide receiver Desmond Howard, who needs a 
new home. They also are willing to deal their first-round pick (No. 3 overall). 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is Ted Marchibroda surely can't see the merits of losing George 
and gaining Harbaugh. There's no comparison in ability. But Marchibroda has no 
personnel power. It all belongs to Tobin. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nice twist, the Falcons also are interested in George. Remember, it was 
the Falcons who traded the first pick of the 1990 draft (who turned out to be 
George) for offensive lineman Chris Hinton, wide receiver Andre Rison and a 
future No. 1 (who turned out to be wide receiver Mike Pritchard). 
</P>
<P>
 New Falcons Coach June Jones won't abandon the run-and-shoot. In fact, he just 
hired his mentor, Mouse Davis, as the quarterbacks coach. And I distinctly 
recall that when Davis rated the best run-and-shoot quarterback prospects in 
1990, his clear choice was Jeff George over Andre Ware. Davis, then an 
assistant with the Detroit Lions, thought George's quick release and sweet arm 
were naturals for the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of Kramer and Ware, the Lions have some real problems. They have an 
interest in George and Houston Oilers quarterback Warren Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 (Pssst, Moon would rather be with the Rams, I think.) 
</P>
<P>
 The New Orleans Saints know they need somebody to pass the ball, although Wade 
Wilson still is an option. They are studying Mitchell and Bubby Brister. The 
Saints also brought in Green Bay Packers restricted free agent Brett Favre, but 
he would cost a bundle -- say, $25 million to $30 million over five years, plus 
first-and third-round picks. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Packers lose Favre, they think left-hander Mark Brunell has some Steve 
Young-like qualities. But this is a playoff team and 1994 is hardly the time to 
plug in a second-year quarterback such as Brunell. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait. I think Packers Coach Mike Holmgren might be able to talk the San 
Francisco 49ers into trading Steve Bono. 
</P>
<P>
 JOE GIBBS CALLED his closest friends first. Some of them were former Redskins 
coaches who were hoping to be reunited with Gibbs on the expansion Carolina 
Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the phone calls left them in disappointment. Gibbs decided last week to 
withdraw his name as a candidate for the Panthers' job because he still is 
enjoying life after coaching with his wife, Pat, and two sons, J.D. and Coy. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the scenes, Gibbs actually was able to determine how much money he 
would be paid (about $2 million), with a generous budget for his coaching 
staff. But once everything was in front of him, he couldn't pull the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it was painful (making the decision)," Gibbs says. "It's a 
big one. When you think about going back to coaching, there's a lot that 
appeals to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers will proceed in 1994 without a coach. It really won't hurt them 
because they don't begin play until 1995 and a personnel staff is in place to 
evaluate talent for free agency, the expansion draft and the college draft. 
</P>
<P>
 A new list of candidates will be produced, although the Panthers are expected 
to make another run at Florida's Steve Spurrier. Look for the University of 
Miami's Dennis Erickson and Wisconsin's Barry Alvarez to surface, as well as 
Vikings defensive coordinator Tony Dungy, whose time has come. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't rule out Gibbs, 53, because it just may be that he needs another 
year to get the itch again. Contrary to belief, he did not say he would never 
coach again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not ready to say that," Gibbs says. 
</P>
<P>
 ONE WEEK AFTER hiring Boston College's Tom Coughlin as head coach, the 
Jacksonville Jaguars made a historic decision by choosing Michael Huyghue to be 
their vice president of football operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Huyghue, 32, becomes the highest-ranking minority in National Football League 
front offices. He was hired away from the Lions, where he was vice president of 
administration and general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael impressed us as one of the brightest, most articulate and yet 
street-smart people in the league," Jaguars President David Seldin says. "He 
gives us one of the great minds in the field of contract negotiations and cap 
management in the National Football League." 
</P>
<P>
 Seldin says Huyghue's role would be particularly important "for an expansion 
team, where we're going to have to start from scratch, with 60 contracts to do, 
and an entire universe of free agents to evaluate and sign." 
</P>
<P>
 Huyghue's role will not supersede personnel decisions made by Coughlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacksonville's decision to give Coughlin authority over the personnel 
department has drawn behind-the-scenes criticism from various league 
executives. But the Jaguars weren't able to get a high-level G.M. such as Bobby 
Beathard or Ron Wolf, both of whom were locked up, so they decided to give the 
keys to Coughlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Seldin explains: "We're committed to give Tom authority and responsibility for 
our performance on the field . . . We don't see how we can hold him accountable 
without giving him that control, particularly in a new era of free agency and 
expansion." 
</P>
<P>
 In Coughlin, the Jaguars get a true battlefield commander, according to the 
NFL people I've spoken with. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you talk to Tom Coughlin, the thing that comes through first is his 
passion for the game, which is something our city can relate to," Seldin says. 
"In building our team, we couldn't think of someone better who epitomizes the 
commitment our city feels. Also, his state of mind is very similar to our fans' 
and city's. Tom is accustomed to being an underdog who can see us through some 
tough times."

HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS; BANNING RALLIES TO REPEAT AS 3-A 
CHAMPION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There is nothing like a little pride to motivate a team. Good thing for 
Wilmington Banning High that it did, because nothing else was working. 
</P>
<P>
 Banning won its second consecutive City Section Division 3-A title by coming 
from behind to beat Roosevelt, 56-55, in overtime Friday night at the Sports 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Banning (19-11) also won a City Section title in Division 4-A in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 But this one was tougher. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt led by as many as 12, and Banning trailed, 53-42, with 3:33 to play. 
But Banning went on an 11-0 run to send the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't coaching," said Banning Coach Marc Paez. "I think they just looked 
up at the scoreboard. I think it was purely pride." 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt Coach David Perea said that he didn't call a timeout during the run 
because he thought the team could play through it. Including overtime, 
Roosevelt (14-12) did not score a field goal in the last 6:33 of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 In overtime, Brian Perkins rebound and basket gave Banning a 55-53 lead. Eric 
Jett's free throw extended it to 56-53, before Roosevelt's Paul Burgueno 
converted two free-throws to cut the lead to one with 38 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 After Banning missed several opportunities, Roosevelt set up for a last shot 
to try to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Mario Hernandez' three-point attempt was long and Roosevelt could not 
get another shot off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't going to just let them take what was ours," said Banning guard 
Jason Pickett. "We had to pull another one of these games out of the hat." 
</P>
<P>
 Pickett led all scorers with 23 points. Hernandez led Roosevelt with 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt showed signs of creating an upset from the start by collapsing on 
the ball every time Banning entered the key and stepping into passing lanes to 
disrupt Banning's offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roughriders led, 17-16, after the first quarter when Paul Burgueno slipped 
behind the banning defense to score a lay-in with 19 seconds left in the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt led at halftime, 30-28, and came out of the locker room with 
confidence that showed in the way they attacked Banning's defense. The run 
peaked at 12 early in the fourth quarter. ARA NAJARIAN

SANTA ANITA; BARGAIN BASEMENT YEARLING IS A WICKED FAVORITE IN BIG 'CAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before David Bernstein went to the January sale at Keeneland in 1990, Philip 
Hersh, a horse owner who was one of the trainer's longtime clients, made a 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Hersh said that if I could pick up a yearling for about $10,000, go ahead 
and get him," Bernstein remembered Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein didn't spend a penny more or a penny less and, four years later, the 
$10,000 was the best money Hersh ever spent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wicked North was the yearling that caught Bernstein's eye and now the 
5-year-old son of Far North is the favorite in today's $1-million Santa Anita 
Handicap. Already, the Kentucky-bred has earned $434,500 from six victories, 
four seconds and a third in 13 starts. 
</P>
<P>
 In a race lacking speed, The Wicked North will try to duplicate his San 
Antonio Handicap victory three weeks ago and begin what Bernstein hopes will be 
a memorable weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Bernstein will saddle Stalcreek in the $300,000 Santa Margarita 
Invitational Handicap, the biggest race of the meeting for older fillies and 
mares. An upset winner over Hollywood Wildcat in the La Canada Stakes last 
month, Stalcreek will be trying to beat another Eclipse Award winner, Paseana, 
in the 1 1/8-mile stake. 
</P>
<P>
 A fan of the sport for most of his 54 years, Bernstein has been training since 
he left a catering business 27 years ago. Never blessed with a large stable, he 
has a chance to fulfill a dream this afternoon with his first Big 'Cap starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so excited just to be in the race," he said. "It's basically a dream come 
true for a trainer to run (a horse) in the Santa Anita Handicap. This is an 
unbelievable thrill for me. I don't sleep as well at night thinking about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the trainers of the six other horses in the Big 'Cap are the ones 
who should be having problems sleeping because the Grade I event appears to be 
The Wicked North's for the taking. 
</P>
<P>
 In the absence of Slew Of Damascus, the pace will be moderate at best--much as 
it was in the San Antonio--and on paper it looks as though The Wicked North 
should lead all the way. 
</P>
<P>
 The only concern may be the distance, since The Wicked North has never gone as 
far as 1 1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know if they can go a mile and a quarter until they do it, but 
we're optimistic," Bernstein said. "He's doing as well as he was before the San 
Antonio, and we're excited and optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the optimism of Bernstein and Hersh is the presence of Kent 
Desormeaux. Santa Anita's leading jockey has four victories and a second in 
five rides on The Wicked North. 
</P>
<P>
 Desormeaux was a fan, however, before any of those victories, even before the 
horse's maiden victory at the 1992 Del Mar meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kent had worked him a couple of times and he said he was something special," 
Bernstein said. "He went on a TV show the morning of the race and said the 
horse would win." 
</P>
<P>
 A client of Bernstein's since 1983 after being recommended to the trainer by 
the late Harry Silbert, Bill Shoemaker's longtime agent, Hersh, 75, has been in 
the business more than 20 years and this is the best horse he has had. Although 
approached with several offers to buy The Wicked North during the last couple 
of years, he has no desire to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I sold this horse, I'd get a divorce," Hersh said. "My wife (Sophie) never 
wanted to be involved, but with this horse she does. We have a trust and she 
wanted her name put on the trust. 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse has been a big thrill for me and my family. (Being in the Santa 
Anita Handicap) is something you dream about. In my (mind) this race is more 
prestigious than the Breeders' Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 He also would relish a victory for Bernstein's sake. "He's honest, that's the 
No. 1 thing about David," Hersh said. "One of the principal factors in horse 
racing is that you have to talk to the owners. A lot of trainers don't talk to 
owners because they feel like they're on a plateau of their own, above (the 
owners). Dave's not like that. He's somebody you can talk to." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stalcreek will probably be the second choice behind Paseana in the Santa 
Margarita, one of two features Sunday at Santa Anita. The $150,000 San Rafael 
Stakes, which attracted six 3-year-olds, is the other. 
</P>
<P>
 A 4-year-old daughter of Stalwart, Stalcreek has won five of 11 starts and has 
been worse than third only twice. She has earned $336,800 for owners Gaylord 
Ailshie and the estate of Joe Shields. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a hard-trying filly and she continues to improve," Bernstein said. "She 
just doesn't get the respect of some of the others. She's not as flashy as The 
Wicked North but she tries every time." Santa Anita Handicap

DEHERE BREAKS LEG, OUT OF TRIPLE CROWN 
</P>

<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After working six furlongs in 1:13 at Palm Beach Downs preparing for the 
Florida Derby, Dehere was discovered to have broken the cannon bone in his 
right hind leg and he is out of the running for the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to the barn of trainer Reynaldo Nobles after the workout, Dehere was 
sore and the condition became worse while he was cooling out.X-rays showed the 
break in the long bone above the ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a statement released by the Due Process Stable of owner Bob 
Brennan, Dehere, the 1993 Eclipse Award winner as the nation's top 2-year-old, 
was resting comfortably in his stall Friday afternoon and further X-rays are to 
be taken to see if he's a suitable candidate for surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dehere has been a remarkable and charismatic athlete and has given us 
enormous joys," said Brennan. "This news sadly demonstrates how fragile these 
athletes are. Right now, our sole interest is to do everything possible to make 
Dehere comfortable and then hope that his racing career is not concluded." 
</P>
<P>
 A winner in five of seven races last year, but soundly defeated by Brocco in 
the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, Dehere, a son of Deputy Minister, was beaten in his 
1994 debut, but came back to win the Fountain of Youth at Gulfstream two weeks 
ago. BOB MIESZERSKI

PREP BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES; MILLER LEADS VERBUM DEI PAST SANTA CLARA 
FOR IV-A TITLE

<P>
 The words were different, but Andre Miller and Damian Cantrell had the same 
notion Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I should take over," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted the ball," Cantrell echoed. 
</P>
<P>
 The seniors got their wishes, but in the end missed shots proved the 
difference as Miller's Verbum Dei High overcame Cantrell's Oxnard Santa Clara, 
71-65, to win the Southern Section Division IV-A championship at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, a 6-foot-2 guard, scored a team-high 32 points, including 24 in the 
first half when the Eagles (24-2) took a 44-34 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, Cantrell scored 21 of his 37 points, including eight in 
the first three minutes of the fourth quarter to carry the Saints (19-8) to a 
59-58 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Verbum Dei then went on a decisive 10-2 run to take a 70-63 lead with 29 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who guarded Cantrell in the fourth quarter, was impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took it to me," said Miller, who made 12 of 21 shots and had 10 rebounds. 
"He wasn't afraid to play, and he took it to the basket." 
</P>
<P>
 Cantrell made 16 of 31 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mike Kearney, coach of Verbum Dei: "I did catch on to (Miller's) ear 
about trying to stop this kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Verbum Dei, which lost Southern Section title games in 1990 (Santa Clara), 
1991 (Santa Clara) and 1993 (Serra), won its first championship since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Santa Clara's downfall came at the free-throw line, where the Saints 
made seven of nine, the Eagles 13 of 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we didn't get some breaks on some calls," said Lou Cvijanovich, who 
has coached Santa Clara to 13 titles in 36 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Cvijanovich was pleased the team did not quit when falling behind early 
in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody in the stands thought when we got down by 10 we'd get blown out," 
he said. "That wasn't the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Cvijanovich made a defensive switch to start the second half, putting 6-3 
senior Jess Pena on Miller, replacing the slower Cantrell. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller scored eight points after the break. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got physical and took me out of my game," Miller acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the first half, Miller was virtually unstoppable in making four of five 
three pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamal Cobbs scored 17 points and Deon Williams added 10 for the Eagles. Pena, 
who had 10, was the only Saint besides Cantrell to score at least 10. BARRY

BOYS' BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES; FINNERAN, EAGLES STEPPED IT UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Margarita forward Brian Finneran is through with the pain and suffering. 
It's all sweetness now. 
</P>
<P>
 A little more than two weeks ago, Finneran's right foot was in a cast, and the 
Eagles were faced with entering the Southern Section III-AA playoffs without 
him. It was not a pleasant prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 6-foot-5 senior was cleared to play before the playoffs began, and he 
will be on the court this morning at Anaheim Arena when the Eagles face Servite 
for the III-AA championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "He means so much to us," Santa Margarita Coach Jerry DeBusk said. "Brian is 
not a high scorer. But he'll get 10-12 points, 10-11 rebounds, three or four 
assists, two or three steals. It all adds up. He dabbles in each category." 
</P>
<P>
 And he was sorely missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Finneran broke a bone in his foot a little more than a month ago. He missed 
the final six games of the regular season and the Eagles struggled. 
</P>
<P>
 When he left the lineup, they were ranked fifth in Orange County and had 
control of the Sea View League. They wobbled to the finish, going 4-2, 
including 53-36 loss to Tustin, which cost the Eagles (23-6) an outright league 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita and Tustin finished tied for first place. Brian Finneran had 
17 points and nine rebounds in the Eagles' 55-33 victory over the Tillers in 
the first meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, having Finneran out made a big difference," DeBusk said loss to 
Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 Finneran was out, but he wasn't idle. He attended every practice and tried to 
stay in shape. DeBusk had a stationary bicycle moved into the gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 Finneran even started shooting around. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would hobble around the court with a basketball, working on his shot, and 
then he rode the bicycle some more," DeBusk said. "But we had no idea if we 
were going to get him back." 
</P>
<P>
 The good news came two days before the Eagles' playoff opener against La 
Quinta. Finneran didn't start but scored 10 points. Brad Finneran, his twin 
brother, had 19 points, eight rebounds, five blocks and four steals in the 
73-58 victory, and the Eagles were rolling again. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Finneran scored 20 points in the second-round victory over Pomona and 15 
in the semifinal victory over Savanna. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a different team when he's playing," Servite acting coach Kevin 
Reynolds said. "I've seen two tapes of them, one where he played and one where 
he didn't. They seem to have gone to a higher level with him back." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Servite also has had to overcome a loss in getting to the playoffs. But the 
Friars have had to do without a coach, not a player. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Hamilton, Servite's second-year coach, was suspended for the remainder 
of the season after an altercation with a game official after the Friars' 62-61 
loss to Marina on Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds was made acting coach and the Friars (20-8) have gone 9-2 since, 
losing by a point to Fountain Valley and in overtime to Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't sure how the kids were going to respond to the coaching change," 
Reynolds said. "Scott and I do things a little differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I streamlined the playbook. Instead of doing a variety of things on offense, 
we do just a few things and try to do them well." 
</P>
<P>
 That philosophy has worked. Servite beat Bolsa Grande, 54-40, in the first 
round, Magnolia, 52-45, in the quarterfinals and Sonora, 47-46, in the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 David Downs, Kristian Vallas and Mark Seaton have taken turns leading the team 
on offense. Guard Kieran Betts usually defends the opponent's top offensive 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen a team that plays with so much intensity," DeBusk said. "They 
find a weakness and exploit it. They play hard and are well coached." 
</P>
<P>
 But whether the Friars will be coached by the same man next season is 
doubtful. Hamilton is likely to be reinstated, according to school officials. 
Not that Reynolds minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm worried about Santa Margarita," Reynolds said. "That's plenty to worry 
about." Division III-AA

STATE WRESTLING TOURNAMENT; AS EXPECTED, CALVARY CHAPEL BUILDS IMPRESSIVE 
FIRST-DAY LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel's statement was a deafening roar to Santa Ana's humble peep. 
</P>
<P>
 In its quest for a second consecutive State wrestling championship, Calvary 
Chapel made impressive gains during Friday's opening rounds of the two-day 
tournament at Pacific's Spanos Center. After three rounds, Calvary Chapel, with 
70.5 points, held a 34-point lead over second-place Moreno Valley Canyon 
Springs, which scored 36.5. 
</P>
<P>
 To illustrate the Eagles' dominance, their first-day point tally is only 8.5 
shy of the 79 they compiled after both days last year. Five of Calvary Chapel's 
eight qualifiers -- Joe Calavitta, Shane and Dane Valdez, Josh Holiday and Ed 
Mosley -- advanced to the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Santa Ana that carved its own niche in school history. With 
103-pounder Roger Santiago's quarterfinal victory, Santa Ana assured itself of 
its first State place winner. Santiago advanced to today's semifinals with a 
7-6 victory over Chino's Paco Arriaga. 
</P>
<P>
 Santiago wrestled Arriaga in Masters and had a bigger margin of victory there, 
but found himself tied, 5-5 and the clock running. Santiago let Arriaga go for 
the escape and a 6-5 lead, but Santiago took him down with four seconds 
remaining for the semifinal berth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm surprised, I didn't think I'd place here," Santiago said. 'My goal was to 
win CIF and place here, but not this high. It's a tough tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured (Santiago would) place, but not this high," Santa Ana Coach Scott 
Glabb said. "Roger deserves it. He's worked very hard and I had a lot of faith 
in him. He has a lot of fight in him." 
</P>
<P>
 So did a number of county wrestlers. Out of 31, 11 advanced through the 
championship rounds and there are nine local representatives out of 13 classes. 
At 103 and 140, the county qualified two semifinalists. Calavitta joined 
Santiago at 103; and Canyon's Darryl Christian and Edison's Alfred Frausto 
represent the 140 class. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian, a two-time state champion in Oregon, is on track to conquer two 
states. The section and Masters champion has easily advanced through this draw, 
with a pin, a 7-2 and a 17-2 victory. Frausto, ranked eighth in the state, 
defeated Calvary Chapel's Danny Robinson, 7-5, in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Missing from the 140 Final Four was El Modena's David Wells, runner-up to 
Christian in the Southern Section and Masters meet. Wells was a 4-1 loser to 
Madera's Moises Perez, last year's State runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Of El Modena's four qualifiers, only Juan Alvarez (135) advanced to the fourth 
round. Teak Sato, who lost last year's 125-pound State title to Eric Guerrero 
of San Jose Independence, meet Guerrero in the quarterfinals and fell, 17-5. 
Chris Jaime (145) was a first-round causality. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley's bid to send two wrestlers to the semifinals fell short 
when 160-pounder Alec Laidlaw lost, 12-10, to Moreno Valley Canyon Springs' 
Albert Romero. Teammate Terry Tuzzolino advanced with a 7-0 decision over 
Covina Schurr's Jonathan DyReyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park hopefuls Vince Virgen (130) lost in Round 2, and heavyweight Wali 
Sibrie won three rounds and earned a semifinal showdown with Greg Ford of 
Whittier. Ford has defeated Sibrie three times this season, but Sibrie defeated 
Ford here in the semifinals last year. Wrestling Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback junior Jim Ambriz was forced to default his first-round heavyweight 
match when he suffered a neck injury against Escalon's Steve Scott. Ambriz, who 
aggravated a neck muscle earlier in the week, walked out of the arena on his 
own. . . . Calvary Chapel's Joe Calavitta was one of nine freshmen of 416 
wrestlers in the tournament, one of four to win first-round matches and the 
lone freshman in the semifinals. . . . Shane Valdez's quarterfinal victory 
marked his 199th career high school triumph and the third consecutive year he 
has reached the State semifinals. Valdez is 199-8 in four years and is 
undefeated (55-0) this season.

CONTRERAS AWAKENS BEFORE HE DESTRUCTS; COLLEGE BASEBALL: NORTHRIDGE PITCHER 
STOPS SANTA BARBARA, 7-6, LEAVING TWO BASERUNNERS IN NINTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Marco Contreras looked like a commuter who nodded off at the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 He woke up at that terrifying instant when the car either careens into a ditch 
or the driver yanks it back onto the road. Either way, with Contreras, it's 
often quite a trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior right-hander weathered a last-gasp threat in the bottom of the 
ninth Friday as Cal State Northridge hung on to beat UC Santa Barbara, 7-6, in 
a nonconference game at Caesar Uyesaka Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara (4-14) scored once in the ninth and had runners at first and 
third with two out when Contreras retired Doug Smaldino on a well-stroked liner 
to center fielder Joey Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I saw that it was going to Joey, I felt pretty good about it," 
Contreras said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty good, it should be noted, is a rung below darn good on the 
had-it-in-the-bag scale. But then, with Contreras, it's usually a white-knuckle 
ride, though he always sticks around to see the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras (2-3) has completed his five starts. Four were decided by one run, 
the other by two. 
</P>
<P>
 Had it not been for the timely handiwork of shortstop Chad Thornhill, 
Northridge and Contreras might have been saddled with another tough defeat. 
Contreras had retired 13 of 15 batters when, with one out and the bases empty 
in the ninth, John Minton sent a nasty, twisting grounder past the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornhill charged, fielded with a bare hand and shot down Minton. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't think about barehanding the ball," Thornhill said. "It's just 
reactive." 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to the play at the time was low-key. Yet Contreras -- who allowed 
five earned runs and eight hits -- then walked Brett Hardy and surrendered a 
pinch-single to David Willis. When Peter Muro slapped a single through the 
right side to bring Santa Barbara within 7-6, it was obvious how big 
Thornhill's play actually was. 
</P>
<P>
 "A real big play," said Northridge Coach Bill Kernen, who chooses his 
superlatives carefully. "Play of the game. A great play, a tough play." 
</P>
<P>
 He owed Contreras a good turn. Thornhill's fielding error in the third started 
a key Santa Barbara rally. Three players already had driven in runs as the 
Matadors (7-9) jumped to a 4-0 lead off right-hander Jared Janke (1-3), but it 
didn't hold up long. 
</P>
<P>
 After Thornhill's error opened the third, Santa Barbara loaded the bases. 
Smaldino then launched a triple into the gap in right-center and scored moments 
later on a groundout to tie the score, 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold gave Northridge a 5-4 lead in the fourth on a sacrifice fly and Keyaan 
Cook made it a two-run edge with a run-scoring groundout two batters later. 
</P>
<P>
 After the seventh run: seat belt time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still fighting that self-destruct syndrome," Kernen said. "One of these 
days. . . ."

CALABASAS, MOORPARK PLAY TO TIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After the Southern Section Division V boys' soccer championship match Friday 
at Gahr High, the opposing teams were a study in contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark and Calabasas highs, still tied, 1-1, after two overtime periods, 
were crowned co-champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas players and coaches celebrated by yelling and jumping all over the 
field. Moorpark looked as if it had just attended a funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 "(My players) felt like losers out there," Moorpark Coach Mike Scanlon said. 
"We dominated the game and this . . . this is hard to take." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Calabasas paraded around the field, holding its CIF championship 
plaque in the air.  
</P>
<P>
 The Coyotes had lost three times in the final since 1986, including last year 
when they fell to Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas Coach John Reich will take a championship any way he can get it. 
</P>
<P>
 "To bring teams here and go home non-winners is hard," he said. "There's no 
question about it, I'm really excited about this." 
</P>
<P>
 Reich said in this case a tie was better than determining the winner in a 
kickout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lost on penalty kicks," he said. "The competitor in me would like to 
have the kickout, but the educator in me thinks this is a reasonable 
compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coyotes ended the season with a 14-3-5 record, while top-seeded Moorpark 
finished 26-2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior halfback Herbie Sirota scored Calabasas' goal on a breakaway with 9:20 
left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Sirota, the team's assist leader, was upset to see the postgame reaction among 
Moorpark players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, it says champions on it and that's what we came here for," he said 
referring to the plaque. "We're champions and that's what counts. If they feel 
like they lost, then they deserve that feeling because they're cocky.' 
</P>
<P>
 The Musketeers tied the score a couple of minutes into the second half when 
Patrick Russo nailed a shot about five feet from the goal after dribbling in 
that area for a couple of seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moorpark is so physical and so quick and it's hard to stay up with them," 
Reich said. "But I think we clogged up the middle effectively enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas goalie Mike Freedman had 17 saves, four of them in overtime. 
Moorpark's Aaron Linder had six. 
</P>
<P>
 The Frontier League champion Musketeers beat Calabasas once during the regular 
season and tied the Coyotes when the teams last met before Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark had never won a Southern Section title in any sport and by the looks 
of the Musketeer bench, Friday's didn't really count.

CAL LUTHERAN'S DUNLAP TAKING HIS PIONEER SPIRIT TO AUSTRALIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Born in a log cabin, raised among arctic wolves. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Mike Dunlap delights in being characterized as a pioneer, a risk taker, a man 
of sturdy stock eager to step into treacherous situations and emerge 
triumphant. 
</P>
<P>
 No mere dreamer, the Cal Lutheran basketball coach practices what he preaches 
when teaching the jump shot: He follows through. 
</P>
<P>
 He will lead the successful Kingsmen (24-2) into the second round of the NCAA 
Division III tournament tonight at UC San Diego. Days after Cal Lutheran either 
is eliminated or wins the tournament, he will fly 12,000 miles to take over as 
coach of the Adelaide 36ers, a team in Australia's professional National 
Basketball League. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap's many friends in the college coaching fraternity will shake their 
heads, same as they did five years ago when he quit as George Raveling's golden 
boy assistant at USC to take over at Cal Lutheran, an obscure school that had 
chewed up seven basketball coaches and spit out each one a loser. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap's wife, Mollie, a lawyer whose lawyer father wrote her a three-page 
brief against moving to Australia, will dutifully follow, sons Holt, 3, and 
Spencer, 1, in tow. (The verdict is in, Mollie told dad. Sentence: 
Three-to-five in the bush, with time added for good performance.) 
</P>
<P>
 As for Dunlap's own judgment, the jury is out. 
</P>
<P>
 But the move is not surprising, given his background, which brings up the log 
cabin. Wolves? Well, sled dogs, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Dunlap, Mike's father, was a high-risk surgeon who set up practice in 
the 1950s in a log cabin in Fairbanks, Alaska, where Mike was born and raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap has thrown himself to the wolves in a figurative sense several times 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a pioneer mind-set," he says. "It's in the Dunlap blood to take a 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
 That's why he is bolting the moment he has transformed Cal Lutheran from a 
doormat to a national championship contender. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you get too comfortable, it's time to move on," says Dunlap, the only 
winning basketball coach in Cal Lutheran's 33-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why his destination is Australia, where he will confront the pressures 
of big-time basketball without enjoying many of its spoils. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are absolutely maniacal about the game there," he says, a faraway gleam 
in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's why the Adelaide brass believes this 36-year-old Yank can hack it 
as the youngest coach in the NBL, a league that is beginning to rival 
Australian football in popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of exciting young kids on the team and Mike has a track record 
of developing young talent," says Barry Richardson, general manager of the 
36ers. "Basketball is the sleeping giant of Australia. Walk down any street in 
Adelaide and a kid is dribbling a ball. Mike is making this move at the right 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 How the general manager of an Australian team would know of Dunlap becomes 
clear by scanning recent Cal Lutheran rosters. At least one player in each of 
his five seasons is Australian. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the imports are a major reason the Kingsmen have raced to three 
consecutive Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Rupert Sapwell, a veteran of all three teams and a native of Melbourne, 
Australia, is the latest example of an arrangement that is mutually beneficial 
to a fledgling professional league on a faraway continent and a small Christian 
university in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior forward has improved from 2.5 points and 2.1 rebounds per game in 
1991-92 to 12.2 and 6.8 this season. He has gone from raw recruit to a polished 
gem ready for a lucrative NBL career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming here turned out to be everything I had hoped it would be," Sapwell 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap established the pipeline through Brian Goorjian, a longtime Australian 
player and coach whose father, Ed, was Dunlap's coach at Loyola Marymount in 
1980-81. 
</P>
<P>
 After Dunlap was able to suit up only seven players and stumbled to a 5-21 
record his first season at Cal Lutheran, he recalled a bit of wisdom Raveling 
had imparted about recruiting: Go where they ain't. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent a month with Goorjian in Melbourne and found it was "like fishing in 
a hatchery." Australian universities do not field teams, leaving no place for 
18-20-year-olds to play except for club teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon O'Donnell, a rugged post player, was the first Australian to make an 
impact, leading Cal Lutheran to records of 14-12 and 16-12 in 1990-91 and 
'91-92. Better still, O'Donnell became a star NBL player upon his return to 
Australia, enhancing Dunlap's reputation there. 
</P>
<P>
 The transformation of Cal Lutheran was completed last season when the team 
posted its first 20-win season, finishing 20-7 and ranked No. 15 in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen had opened Dunlap's tenure with 13 consecutive losses, including 
11 on the road against Division II teams. Cal Lutheran was nothing but cannon 
fodder and Dunlap recalls the experience as "gnarly." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the team opened this season with 15 consecutive victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, the fact that Dunlap had accepted the Adelaide job in August did 
not distract the Kingsmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "He let us know what was going on, he is really upfront about everything," 
says Damon Ridley, the team's scoring leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap's unwillingness to compromise his beliefs will make or break him in 
Adelaide, a somewhat provincial city of 1.2 million in the state of South 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I anticipate rough waters but if I hold steady to my convictions, I can turn 
it around," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to transform a staid, plodding team that barely qualified for the 
playoffs last season into an up-tempo squad that will play in-your-face 
man-to-man defense and move the ball quickly up the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 This will please the crowd, and if it doesn't please the old guard, well, 
Dunlap simply will bring in new guards. And forwards. And centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some old heads on the team might be stubborn," says Sapwell, who will skip 
his senior season at Cal Lutheran and return to play for a team in Melbourne, 
"but they will have to conform or get out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike will get a winning group in there." 
</P>
<P>
 He has already begun. At Dunlap's urging, Adelaide signed last season's NBL 
most valuable player, Robert Rose, who was a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Spencer, the top assistant at Cal Lutheran for four years, has been in 
Adelaide for two months, conducting practices and laying the groundwork for 
Dunlap's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening night is April 9. There will be no off-season for Dunlap this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anticipation is high," Spencer says. "People are excited to have Mike come 
over here. But they are antsy." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the season begins, there is plenty of time for adjustments. The slow pace 
of typical Australian play mirrors the season itself, which is closer to a 
marathon than a sprint. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams spread a 26-game schedule over nearly eight months, playing once a week 
and taking a month off in July-August to prepare the national team for the 
World Games or the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 The drawn-out schedule will give Dunlap time to strengthen ties in the 
community and head off any anti-Yank resentment before it gathers steam. He 
plans to hold weekly coaching clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think many coaches will show up at the beginning, but eventually it 
will be full," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap astutely bought himself time when he negotiated his contract with 
Adelaide. The pact is for five years, although Dunlap can renegotiate after 
three. His salary would put him among the top 15% of NCAA Division I coaches, 
which, by the way, is what he aspires to become. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a boomerang, eventually he will return home. 
</P>
<P>
 "This job will be a huge learning curve," he says. "It will stretch my 
boundaries. It will make me a better coach." 
</P>
<P>
 From his first full-time job as an assistant at Loyola Marymount at age 22, 
through his years under Raveling at Iowa and USC, to his first head coaching 
job at Cal Lutheran, Dunlap has benefited from each step up the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 And for now, the ladder leads Down Under.

COPING WITH LOSS AMID VICTORY; DEATH OF GOFFREDO'S WIFE COLORS CRESCENTA 
VALLEY'S EXPLOITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 As John Goffredo prepared to coach the biggest basketball game of his life -- 
the Southern Section boys' Division I-AA championship game -- dozens of letters 
and phone calls poured in, from friends and strangers alike. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many people who are so happy this is happening to me," the 
Crescenta Valley High coach said. "They say it shows there is some justice." 
</P>
<P>
 That is where the letters are wrong. To imply that justice has been done would 
suggest that any number of victories on the basketball court can erase 
Goffredo's loss. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Falcons meet Long Beach Poly in the championship game at 6:45 tonight 
in the Anaheim Arena, it will be, for Goffredo, little more than two more hours 
in which he won't have to think how much he misses his wife, Kathy, who died of 
cancer in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you share every happy thing that happens to you in your life with 
someone, and then they are not there to share it anymore, every happy moment 
becomes a sad one," Goffredo said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Falcons, an at-large team with no returning starters, upset Santa 
Ana Valley last Friday to advance to tonight's game, Goffredo sat on the bench 
and cried. 
</P>
<P>
 Tears of joy for a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Tears of sorrow because Kathy couldn't be there to share it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I'm at the pinnacle of my career and the basement of my 
emotions," Goffredo said. "That's the paradox of this whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was almost as if John and Kathy Goffredo were put on earth for each other. 
</P>
<P>
 They were born one day apart. They first met in seventh grade, first dated in 
ninth. Goffredo was the captain of the basketball team at Burroughs High in 
Burbank. Kathy was a cheerleader. Goffredo knew early this was the woman of his 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 They dated for eight years, through high school and college, then married 
after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was incredibly intelligent," he said. "Yet she loved to be with people 
and to have fun. She would do anything for anybody. You don't find many people 
that are as giving and as caring as she was." 
</P>
<P>
 Goffredo also was taken by her beauty. Even as she grew older, she took pride 
in her appearance. At 42, she and her 15-year-old daughter Kristen shared 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond between John and Kathy strengthened during 20 years of marriage. They 
had three children: Kristen, Kimberly, 12, and Jimmy, 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kathy and I were so close, we always used to joke that we never saw any 
couple as in love with each other as we were," Goffredo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Every evening, when Goffredo returned home from Crescenta Valley and Kathy 
from Hoover, where she was a math teacher, the two took a walk together. It was 
as much because they relished the time together as it was for fitness. 
</P>
<P>
 During one of their walks in November, 1992, Goffredo noticed Kathy limping. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years earlier, doctors had diagnosed a fibroid, a non-cancerous tumor on 
her uterus. The doctors told her it was five centimeters in diameter, but 
nothing to cause alarm. Many women have fibroids that come and go, doctors told 
her. A year later, it was 10 centimeters. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kathy experienced the hip pain, doctors first thought the fibroid was 
pushing on a nerve. A CAT scan in December showed a cancerous tumor. It was on 
an ovary, not the uterus, and spreading to her hip. 
</P>
<P>
 She underwent surgery Jan. 4 and the affected tissue was removed. Kathy began 
chemotherapy and radiation treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 Goffredo became almost totally detached from his basketball team, which was 
11-1 at the time of the surgery, coaching only in games and leaving the 
practices to his assistants. 
</P>
<P>
 "His concentration wasn't on basketball," Crescenta Valley Athletic Director 
Bob Canfield said. "He had other worries. John is very loyal to his family. He 
was going to do anything she required. Anything." 
</P>
<P>
 He offered to quit coaching, but Kathy wouldn't allow it. She never talked 
about anything but total recovery, and she seemed headed in that direction. 
Less than three weeks after the surgery, she wanted to see a basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to talk her out of it," Goffredo said, "but she wanted to be there. 
She wanted everyone to know she was OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy sat just inside the entrance to the Crescenta Valley gym, smiling and 
greeting people as they arrived for a game against first-place Muir. A capacity 
crowd saw Crescenta Valley win a dramatic game, 74-72, handing the Mustangs 
their first Pacific League loss in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Crescenta Valley players headed out the door and down to the locker 
room after the game, they hugged Kathy, one by one. They signed the game ball 
and presented it to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the greatest basketball game I've ever coached," Goffredo said. "Not 
just because we won, but how and why we won, and for whom." 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons dedicated the season to Kathy, and everything started looking up. 
Crescenta Valley continued to improve and advanced to the section semifinals 
for the first time in Goffredo's 16-year career at Crescenta Valley. They 
posted 22 victories, the most by one of Goffredo's teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy also continued to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "She started walking better," he said. "They started taking blood tests and 
the cancer in her blood was down to zero. She was better and better. She went 
through the chemotherapy like no one had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we had licked it." 
</P>
<P>
 Then in May, watching one of her daughters in a dance performance, Kathy felt 
a pain in her back. 
</P>
<P>
 It was another tumor. There were also three in her brain and others throughout 
her body. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just got worse and worse," Goffredo said. "She couldn't walk. She couldn't 
get off the couch. I had to carry her to the bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy went back into the hospital. She slipped into a coma temporarily, then 
came home for one last time. For two or three days, she was coherent, able to 
see visitors and talk to everyone. Then she went back to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Her immune system weakened by the cancer treatments, she developed pneumonia 
and died Aug. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tragedies don't bring families closer together. They merely reveal the 
families that already are. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole Goffredo family attends Crescenta Valley games, just as it always 
has -- Jimmy as the ball boy, Kristen as a cheerleader and Kimberly as a fan. 
</P>
<P>
 Goffredo still coaches Jimmy's youth basketball team. Even Jimmy's sisters 
show up for his games. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great family," Goffredo said. "All the kids are taking care of each 
other because they love each other. That's the way Kathy raised them." 
</P>
<P>
 Without Kathy, though, Goffredo let his children decide if he would continue 
to coach, or if he would stay home with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to be their parent," Goffredo said. "If they didn't want me to coach, 
I wasn't going to coach. It was going to be as hard on me as it was on them. 
They wanted me to coach. In their words, they wanted everything to be the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my goal right there, to try to make everything as close to the same as 
we possibly could. That's why we don't have a housekeeper." 
</P>
<P>
 Goffredo cleans the house. He makes lunches, does laundry, shuttles kids back 
and forth to baseball practice and dance lessons. He cooks, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only make grilled cheese and macaroni," he said. "We eat out a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 On the basketball court, Goffredo said he has tried to coach the same way he 
always has, with a few exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Goffredo annually holds a meeting Nov. 1 with all the players in the Crescenta 
Valley basketball program, from the freshman to the varsity. He gives what 
amounts to a pep talk. Goffredo couldn't muster the emotion this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the tasks Goffredo can no longer handle fall into the laps of 
assistants Gene Murphy, Jim Smiley, Jack Dunbar and John Pehar. They have done 
everything from producing and printing the program to organizing the alumni 
game to planning the Crescenta Valley tournament in December. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gene Murphy has been unbelievable," Goffredo said. "He has done everything 
that no one knows about and not taken any credit, never once asked for a thank 
you. All I do is go out there and coach two hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
 He coaches a team that had no returning starters, a team that lost its front 
line to injuries early in the season, a team that lost its gym to the Jan. 17 
earthquake, a team that finished fourth in the Pacific League and slipped into 
the playoffs with an at-large berth. 
</P>
<P>
 He will coach that team in the championship game tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Goffredo) has done a miraculous job," said Canfield, the athletic 
director. "An absolutely miraculous job. There is a very sensitive balance 
between his responsibilities at school and his responsibilities and obligations 
as a single parent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be an overwhelming burden at times, and he has handled it masterfully. 
It's just a testimony to his true character." 
</P>
<P>
 When Goffredo speaks to the team before tonight's game, the first section 
championship game for Crescenta Valley since 1971, there won't be any reference 
to Kathy, just her initials on the chalkboard, as they have been for each 
playoff victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't use (Kathy's death) as a motivational tool," Goffredo said. "I think 
that would cheapen everything I believe. But I don't think anything needs to be 
said. I think they know how I feel and I know how they feel." 
</P>
<P>
 For two hours tonight, Goffredo will not be thinking how much he misses his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he figures, in some way, she will be there.

DIVISION II BOYS' SOCCER CHAMPIONSHIP; ESPERANZA, MATER DEI PLAYERS SEEM CALM 
ABOUT TITLE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A section soccer championship will be decided today, but neither team is 
acting as if the game is any different than a regular-season contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids are not worried about the finals," said Esperanza Coach Kino Oaxaca, 
whose team will meet Mater Dei at 4 p.m. at Cerritos Gahr High School for the 
Southern Section Division II boys' title. "It's just another game to them. I 
think it'll eventually hit them when they wake up (Saturday) morning. I think 
they'll start showing some emotion then." 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza (19-5-5) has reason to be nonchalant about the section final. The 
Aztecs were there last year and beat Santa Ana Valley, 2-1. Mater Dei (23-2-4) 
is making its first final appearance since 1987. The Monarchs reached the final 
with a thrilling 2-1 overtime victory Tuesday at Long Beach Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of surprised at how my kids acted the next day," Mater Dei Coach 
Martin Stringer said. "You wouldn't know we had just won a big game. It was 
real mellow in practice." 
</P>
<P>
 But Oaxaca doesn't figure the mellowness will continue today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect it to be a physical game," Oaxaca said. "Not dirty, just physical." 
</P>
<P>
 The key for Esperanza and Mater Dei might be stopping the other team's big 
scorer. Forward Kevin Quigley (22 goals, 12 assists) is the Monarchs' leading 
scorer; forward Mark Alleman (19 goals, 20 assists) is the Aztecs' big gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a big threat," Stringer said. "We've got to pay particular attention to 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei must also watch center halfback Mike Morales (nine goals, 10 
assists), who scored Esperanza's winning goal in sudden-death overtime against 
El Toro in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza has been amazing in overtime during the playoffs. Three of its 
victories have come in overtime, one on penalty kicks against Santa Barbara in 
the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key for us is the first half," Oaxaca said. "If we enter the second half 
with a one-goal differential, we'll feel good."

FOCUSING AMID THE TURBULENCE; GIRLS' BASKETBALL: UNDEFEATED ALEMANY HAS PLAYED 
WITHOUT ITS GYM, ITS SCHOOL, AND, FOR A WHILE, ITS COACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 Tumult and success, those strange bedfellows, have shadowed the Alemany High 
girls' basketball team all season. 
</P>
<P>
 The distractions keep mounting. And the Indians keep winning. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany (27-0) has advanced to its third consecutive Southern Section final, 
facing San Bernardino (25-4) in the Division II-A championship game today at 1 
p.m. at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians are enjoying the finest season in school history. They are also 
enduring the most turbulent year in memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since the pregnancy, everything has been snowballing," forward Samantha 
Rigley said. "I think we're all pretty tired of all the distractions." 
</P>
<P>
 Rigley referred to Coach Melissa Hearlihy, who missed five games in December 
to give birth to her first child, Joshua. Hearlihy drew widespread attention 
for missing only those five contests, returning to coach in a game five days 
after undergoing a Cesarean section. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a month later, the school and its gym were closed because of damage 
caused by the Jan. 17 earthquake. Classes resumed two weeks later at a 
temporary site near the school, and the basketball team scrambled to find 
practice and game sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany has played what were supposed to be home playoff games at St. Francis 
and Crespi highs. Practices are run at a Burbank gym, a half-hour drive from 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Students eventually will use portable classrooms being assembled in an orange 
grove near the school, but until then they are using Our Lady Queen of Angels 
seminary. Juniors and seniors attend classes in the morning, freshmen and 
sophomores in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard because we don't see each other at school like we used to, since 
the classes are split," said Rigley. "And the gym . . . There's names for that 
gym -- like the Brickhouse. It has a lot of personality. It's like a tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss our school." 
</P>
<P>
 The team is ranked fifth in the state and favored to win today's game and the 
Division II state championships, for which playoffs begin next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Four starters -- Rigley, senior forward Zevette Mitchell, junior guard Kelly 
McKay and sophomore center Carly Funicello -- average more than 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Bernardino, the Indians will face a trapping, pressing team that relies 
on guards LaTonya Kindle (18 points per game) and La Cresha Flannigan (12 ppg). 
Flannigan, however, might not play because of a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearlihy said Alemany must resist playing an up-tempo game, maintaining 
instead its effective half-court offense. But Hearlihy is confident because the 
Indians are playing better than they have all season, winning four playoff 
games by an average of 28.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost think it's worked out for us in a positive way because we haven't 
had a chance to peak until now," Hearlihy said. "I had to leave because of the 
pregnancy, so we hit a lull and then started to play better. Then we had the 
earthquake and had the same lull. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I think we're coming back and peaking at right time," she said. "I think 
it's all for the good -- if that's possible."

 Village Christian also plays for a girls' section championship today. The 
Crusaders (25-1) face defending champion Cerritos Valley Christian in the 
Division IV-A title game at 6:45 p.m. at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1990-1991 season, the Crusaders were 5-14 and so bad that then-freshman 
Jeanne Beauchamp, who had been promoted to the varsity, was returned to the 
junior varsity because the varsity campaign was deemed a lost cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, senior point guard Beauchamp (11 ppg, 5.8 assists) and 
sophomore forward Lindy James (17.2 ppg, 10 rebounds) have led Village 
Christian to its second consecutive undefeated Alpha League championship and to 
the brink of its first section title.

SINGLE-MINDED SCHAEFFER NOW A TRUE PROSPECT; HARVARD CATCHER INCREASED FOCUS, 
EARNED SCHOLARSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Depending on whom you ask, Jon Schaeffer either burst into the spotlight last 
summer, or the spotlight burst onto him. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaeffer had been the starting catcher at Harvard-Westlake High since his 
sophomore year, but he never got much attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, he starred for the Woodland Hills East American Legion team that 
advanced to the Area 6 playoffs. And he played in the Area Code Games, a magnet 
for scouts and college coaches seeking the best talent among rising seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, he signed a letter of intent to play college baseball at the 
university of his dreams, Stanford. In June, he probably will be selected in 
the major league draft. 
</P>
<P>
 How did this happen? 
</P>
<P>
 Most believe Schaeffer's commitment to baseball finally paid off with a 
markedly improved game. Others think Schaeffer was always good, but no one 
noticed because he played at Harvard, not known for baseball excellence. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaeffer's time had been divided between baseball and basketball for most of 
his life. He attended Montclair Prep from seventh through ninth grades and 
played both sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking a greater academic challenge, Schaeffer transferred to Harvard before 
his sophomore year. He played varsity baseball and varsity basketball. 
Schaeffer was not a bad basketball player, but he was an exceptional baseball 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made the decision that baseball would be my forte," Schaeffer said. "I 
stopped playing basketball because Coach (Greg) Hilliard demands a lot from you 
when you play basketball, and I knew if I wanted to play college baseball at 
the Division I level, I had to dedicate myself completely." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Nez Balelo, Schaeffer's personal baseball trainer at the West 
Coast Baseball School in Agoura Hills, that decision was the turning point. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minute he quit basketball is when he turned it on and that's when he 
became a better baseball player," said Balelo, who played parts of six seasons 
as a shortstop in the Seattle Mariner organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaeffer went through two 10-week development programs at West Coast, once 
before his junior season and again last fall. For three hours a day, three 
times a week, Schaeffer and five other high school players did nothing but 
train. They took batting practice and did fielding drills. A running coach 
worked with them. They lifted weights. They even had sessions on nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Balelo) really sculpted my swing and took me from being a mediocre player to 
a guy who can make an impact on a team," Schaeffer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard Coach Jim Brink, incidentally, doesn't buy any of this. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was really good right from the beginning," Brink said. "He's 
always been pretty focused on baseball. (Quitting basketball) just allowed him 
more time to train. There's not much difference in his attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always put the numbers up." 
</P>
<P>
 True, but his sophomore year he hit .428 with three home runs and 31 runs 
batted in against opponents such as Bell-Jeff and St. Genevieve in the San 
Fernando League. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Wolverines moved into the Mission League, one of the toughest 
in the area. He batted .509 with four home runs and 20 RBIs, but the Wolverines 
were 5-18 and had no other prospects to attract scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The most exposure Schaeffer received came when the Wolverines were no-hit by 
Crespi's Jeff Suppan, a second-round pick of the Boston Red Sox. Schaeffer's 
lone distinction that day was that he was hit by a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 But last summer, Schaeffer played for Woodland Hills East, an American Legion 
team that won the District 20 championship and earned a trip to UCLA's Jackie 
Robinson Stadium for the Area 6 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Scouts and college coaches saw Schaeffer go on a blistering 17-for-29 streak 
during the district and area playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "His offense improved immensely," said Jody Breeden, coach of the rival Van 
Nuys East team. "I had seen him last year and two years ago and he struggled 
offensively. Through a lot of hard work and taking a lot of swings, he 
developed into a pretty tough out." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the summer, Breeden chose Schaeffer for the Area Code Games. He and 
16 other Valley-area players traveled to San Diego for four days of the most 
intensely watched baseball of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quite an experience," Schaeffer said. "I've never been in a situation 
where there were so many scouts and coaches watching. There was a lot of 
pressure to perform." 
</P>
<P>
 Pregame infield practice was a show in itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The coaches) said throw the ball as hard as you can every time, put zip on 
the ball and be crisp," Schaeffer said. "A lot of the scouts would be there 
during infield, then you'd look back during the game, and half of them would be 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Schaeffer said he had four hits in the four games, and since no one kept any 
stats, you'll have to take him at his his word. Coaches from about 15 schools 
were sufficiently impressed to contact Schaeffer after the games. 
</P>
<P>
 One was Stanford, the school of Schaeffer's dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I found out they had some interest in me, I was really excited," he 
said, "but I tried not to bias myself until I took all my trips. But I knew in 
the back of my mind this was a place where I thought I could really have a 
great time throughout my college years." 
</P>
<P>
 Schaeffer chose Stanford over USC, Pepperdine, Cornell and Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said Schaeffer will spend next season as an 
apprentice to catcher A.J. Hinch, the national high school baseball player of 
the year in 1992. Hinch was a second-round pick in the draft, but turned down 
the Chicago White Sox to play at Stanford. Hinch likely will be a first- or 
second-round pick and sign following the 1995 season, opening the door for 
Schaeffer as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 But some scouts question Schaeffer's ability to catch at higher levels. His 
footwork is poor and his arm is average, they say. Marquess disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously not many high school catchers have a cannon for an arm," Marquess 
said, "but there are things we can do, working on his release, and we think he 
will be more than adequate at our level." 
</P>
<P>
 No one questions Schaeffer's bat. That alone will be enough for a team to take 
a chance on him in the draft. But he isn't likely to be drafted high enough to 
justify the six-figure bonus it usually takes to pry players from Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 A Stanford scholarship, after all, was the reason Schaeffer gave up 
basketball, the reason he spent all those afternoons with Balelo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've sacrificed a lot," Schaeffer said, "but all the sacrifices I've made 
have paid off. Now I have the chance to go to Stanford and I look back at all 
the effort I've put in and it's really paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you play well, things will happen. People will start to see you and 
recognize your abilities."

HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL ROUNDUP; WOLF PROVIDES LIFT FOR EL CAMINO REAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Randy Wolf picked up where he left off last season, allowing one infield hit 
and one walk in El Camino Real High's 11-0 victory over Birmingham in a 
first-round San Fernando tournament game Friday at El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf threw a no-hitter and a perfect game last season in leading El Camino 
Real to the City Section 4-A Division championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Phino played the role of spoiler in the fourth inning, with an assist 
from Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 Phino hit a ground ball between Wolf and third baseman Roee Meisels. Wolf 
knocked it down far enough from Meisels to keep him from fielding the ball and 
throwing out Pino. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf, a senior left-hander, promptly picked off Phino. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf also hit a two-run home run and a triple. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Cooper broke the game open in the fourth inning with a two-run triple. 
He scored on Meisels' double to give El Camino Real a 5-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In other San Fernando tournament first-round games: 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 2, Franklin 1 -- Kelvin Delgado scored the winning run on a single 
by Tony Williams (three for five) in the 10th inning at Cleveland. Junior 
Brignac and Casey Roth each added two hits for Cleveland (1-0). Freshman Mike 
Schultz pitched five shutout innings in relief. 
</P>

Ardito drove in Danny Phillips with a one-out sacrifice fly in the seventh

runners at second and third at Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura 4, Canyon 4 -- The Cowboys scored the tying run on a dropped popup 
with two out in the seventh inning at Canyon. The game was called after eight 
innings because of darkness. For tournament purposes, Ventura was credited with 
a victory because it outhit Canyon, 7-5.

 The signs are good for the Campbell Hall High boys' basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings play Pasadena Poly for the Southern Section Division I 
championship at 7:30 tonight at Pepperdine's Firestone Fieldhouse.In 1992, when 
the Vikings won the V-AA championship, the final was played at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell Hall (20-8) defeated Delphic League rival Faith Baptist in the title 
game that year. The Vikings advanced to the championship game this season by 
defeating league rival Brentwood, 62-60, Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the Vikings beat Pasadena Poly in the second round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the home team, we got to choose the site," Campbell Hall Coach Jon Palarz 
said. "Hopefully, it will bring us the same kind of success." 
</P>
<P>
 After sneaking into the playoffs as the Delphic's third-place team, the 
Vikings are playing their best basketball of the season. But to stop Pasadena 
Poly (21-4), the Vikings must thwart the front line of Cameron Murphy and 
brothers Scott and Rob Reeder, all of whom are at least 6-foot-5. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings, however, have the biggest player on the court in 6-foot-10 center 
Alex Lopez. Senior swingmen Simeon Woodall and Harold Sylvester complement 
Lopez with solid outside shooting. MICHAEL LAZARUS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Agoura High football Coach Frank Greminger announced his resignation Friday 
after a 25-year career at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Greminger, 55, had a record of 154-99-3 and led the Chargers to five Frontier 
League titles and a Southern Section Desert-Mountain Conference championship in 
1984.He will continue to coach the Chargers' golf team and teach physical 
education.

<P>
 Agoura Athletic Director John Crow said applications for Greminger's successor 
will be accepted at the Las Virgenes Unified School District office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a sad day," Crow said. "How he stayed in that long is beyond 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Crow said Greminger, who could not be reached for comment, had tired of the 
time commitments required by football. 
</P>

CRESCENTA VALLEY HOPING THIS DANCE IS A WALTZ; BOYS' BASKETBALL: FALCONS' 
CHAMPIONSHIP CHANCES HINGE ON ABILITY TO SLOW TEMPO AGAINST LONG BEACH POLY.

<P>
 The Crescenta Valley High basketball team is expected to lose a playoff game 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Part Five. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons, an at-large entry, face Long Beach Poly for the Southern Section 
Division I-AA championship at 6:45 p.m. at the Anaheim Arena.As in their four 
previous playoff games, the Falcons are decided underdogs. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to handle the Jackrabbits, Crescenta Valley (19-9) will need to slow 
the tempo, as it did in playoff victories against Nogales, Antelope Valley, 
Fontana and Santa Ana Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Poly (24-6), the Moore League champion, is led by 6-foot-6 junior forward 
James Brown, an excellent outside shooter who is leading the team with 16 
points per game. Zerrick Campbell, a 6-6 senior forward, is averaging 12 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons' top players are 6-4 junior forward Brock Jacobsen, 6-0 senior 
guard Richard O'Neill, and 6-9 junior center Blake Jacobson. O'Neill and 
Jacobsen are each averaging more than 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley Coach John Goffredo said Blake Jacobson's improved rebounding 
-- he had 15 against Santa Ana Valley -- has been the key to the playoff run by 
the Falcons, who finished fourth in the Pacific League. 
</P>
<P>
 With no starters back from last year's playoff semifinalist, Goffredo was 
expecting to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just hoping to win a game or two (in the playoffs) and lay a decent 
foundation," Goffredo said. "But it looks like they've laid the foundation, put 
up the walls, the roof and the drywall." JEFF FLETCHER

PEREZ LOOMS LARGE IN PLANS OF BURROUGHS; BOYS' SOCCER: INDIANS ON VERGE OF 
FIRST SECTION TITLE THANKS TO SENIOR'S KNACK FOR MAKING THE BIG PLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The day the laughter died. . . . Burroughs High freshman Roberto Perez, all 
4-foot-11, maybe 100 pounds of him stepped onto the soccer field to play in his 
first varsity match at a December, 1990, holiday tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so small," Coach Mike Kodama recalled. "The other team was laughing." 
</P>
<P>
 The chuckles stopped by the time the match had wound down to penalty kicks, 
and Perez stepped up and calmly drilled his shot into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "He put it away like it was second nature," Kodama said. "Even then, you could 
see the power in his shot and his vision for the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out the joke was on the Indians' opponents. Perez, now a 5-7, 130-pound 
senior, has capped an excellent career by leading Burroughs to its first 
Southern Section final. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians (15-6-3) will play Bell Gardens tonight at 6 at Gahr High for the 
Division III championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez's achievements belie his physical stature. He is always one of the 
smallest players on the field, but there is no one more dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 He has scored seven goals in Burroughs' four playoff victories, including the 
decisive goal in two of the matches. He has 17 goals and a school-record 55 in 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roberto is a clutch player," Kodama said. "He senses that we're really close 
(to a championship), and when it comes time to make the big plays, he's making 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 One might expect such a performance from an All-American, as Perez was named 
by a national preseason poll of coaches. He was the only area player selected 
to the 50-man team. 
</P>
<P>
 One might not expect such a performance from someone who looks as about as 
imposing as a ball boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I'm not the biggest guy on the team, I have to work around the field," 
Perez said. "I try to work one-on-one on the outside. I like to go where 
there's open space." 
</P>
<P>
 His strategy works. The two-time Foothill League player of the year picks his 
spots, laying off larger opponents much of the time -- "like Wayne Gretzky," 
Kodama says -- then exploding with a creative run or pass that often ends in a 
Burroughs goal. 
</P>
<P>
 He is an extremely skilled ballhandler and passer as evidenced by his nine 
assists, and he possesses a surprisingly powerful shot. He also has carte 
blanche from Kodama. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't have a position," Kodama said. "He has the run of the field. He's 
one of those unusual players to whom you just say: 'Find an opening.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Perez will end his accolade-laden high school career today, but he longs for 
one last achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've won league three times," Perez said. "And I hope we win (a Southern 
Section title). That's the one I want." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Grant girls' soccer team will meet San Pedro in the City Section 
championship match at noon today at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers (11-3-2), who lost to Chatsworth by one goal in last season's 
championship match, face a big, physical San Pedro team that this week handed 
Chatsworth its first loss to a City team since play began in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant is led by Nicole Bucciarelli (43 goals) and goalie Kristin Kiley-Boynton 
(10 shutouts).

COMMUNITY COLLEGE MEN'S BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS; SADDLEBACK, LONG BEACH PLAY FOR 
SPOT IN STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saddleback and Long Beach City, which have split two games this season, play 
tonight for a berth in the State community college men's basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback (23-8) travels to Long Beach (28-6) for a 7 p.m. game in the final 
round of the Southern California playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback beat Long Beach, 89-68, in the title game of the Rancho Santiago 
tournament, Dec. 30. Long Beach won, 76-73, in the Fullerton tournament Nov. 
19. Saddleback's one-sided victory came a night after Long Beach won a 
four-overtime game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going to their gym at this point in the season is going to tough," Saddleback 
Coach Bill Brummel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach, which has won 11 in a row, is the third-seeded team in Southern 
California. Saddleback is No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the third consecutive year that Saddleback has reached a regional 
final. The Gauchos lost to Los Angeles Trade Tech last season and Ventura the 
year before. Saddleback last reached the State tournament in 1987, when the 
Gauchos lost in the title game to Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Tes Whitlock leads Saddleback with 21 points per game. Whitlock, a sophomore 
transfer from Arizona State, scored 26 in the 66-54 victory over Rio Hondo 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Whitlock, the Gauchos rely on balanced scoring. Antoine Jefferson, a 
sophomore forward, averages 16 points and 10 rebounds. Sophomore guards Derrick 
Walsh (14 points) and Josh Borella (10 points, 5.5 assists) and freshman 
forward Eric Ambrozich (11 points, six rebounds) are the other starters. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach is led by sophomore forward Kevin Beal, the two-time South Coast 
Conference player of the year. Beal (23 points) became Long Beach's all-time 
leading scorer in the Vikings' 100-83 victory over Los Angeles Southwest 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus Rogers, a guard, averages 17 and Mark Neal, a forward, 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Imperial Valley (21-11) is at Ventura (33-2); Los Angeles City (27-5) is at 
Chaffey (30-5); and Southwestern (26-5) is at Riverside (28-6) in the other 
Southern California finals. All games are at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The four winners advance to the State tournament, which starts Thursday at UC 
Irvine.

the winning shot after Butte's Iseth Cowan (26 points) got a rebound but lost 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't realize the basket counted until my teammates hugged me," Quinn 
said. "I thought time had run out." 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West was at its best early, opening a 31-9 lead. The Rustlers led, 
39-22, at the half but Butte rallied in the second half, outscoring the 
Rustlers, 42-26.

<P>

eight assists. Kristin Brun had a team-high 11 rebounds and six assists.

CLARK HAS LA QUINTA'S NUMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There will be many Garden Grove League baseball coaches happy to see Chris 
Clark finally leave Kennedy, but none happier than La Quinta's Dave Demarest. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's beaten us four times," Demarest said. "I think I'll probably be at his 
graduation." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Demarest, Clark's graduation isn't for another three months. 
In the meantime, the two-time all-league pitcher will spend his Wednesdays and 
Fridays haunting Demarest and the rest of the Garden Grove League. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a super kid, a class act," Demarest said. "He really seems to get up for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he doesn't get up for other teams, but two of Clark's seven victories 
last season came against La Quinta, which lost only six games, one of them in 
the Southern Section Division III final. 
</P>
<P>
 All of Clark's victories over the Aztecs have come against their ace, Jim 
Livernois, who went 13-3 last season and was named The Times Orange County 
player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's the enthusiasm of both teams that seems to bring out the best in 
both teams," Clark said. "Maybe we're throwing a little harder than usual." 
</P>
<P>
 And even when he isn't at his best, Clark somehow finds a way to beat La 
Quinta. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not a big kid, but he throws hard," Demarest said. "He's just a 
competitor. He beats us with his best stuff and when he doesn't have anything. 
He beat us 3-2 (in 10 innings) and, the whole game, he never had his slider. We 
came into the game hitting everything in sight, but we couldn't do anything 
against him." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy Coach Chris Pascal said some of the things Clark does are 
unexplainable. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not the biggest, fastest or strongest kid, but he beats you," Pascal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark beat opponents on the football field in the same way. He didn't have a 
rifle arm, but he used his athleticism and his smarts to lead Kennedy to the 
Division VII semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Clark's smarts, determination and ability haven't been enough to 
attract any college coaches. Professional scouts and coaches can't seem to get 
past his 5-foot-10, 175-pound frame and his 82-m.p.h. fastball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't had a nibble on him," Pascal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said he hasn't heard much from Division I college football coaches 
either, but he isn't surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take it in stride," said Clark, who sees himself as a college safety rather 
than a quarterback. "It would be harder if I didn't know why. I understand. I 
think I'll get to where I want to be, it just might take me a little longer." 
</P>
<P>
 But the future can wait. For now, Clark is only concerned with beating La 
Quinta two more times and leading Kennedy to the league title. And Pascal said 
there isn't much doubt who the team leader is. 
</P>
<P>
 "About the middle of last season, Chris became more of a presence," Pascal 
said. "He got on guys a little, but Chris can do that because most of the time, 
he's working his tail off." 
</P>
<P>
 It's that work ethic that Pascal says will eventually pay off for Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll end up playing somewhere and he'll be successful," Pascal said. 1993

 IN REVIEW Highlights 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta came within an out of winning the Southern Section Division III 
title, but Ronnie Hall's single gave Tustin a thrilling 3-2 victory. . . . The 
loss in the title game was one of the few low points for La Quinta pitcher Jim 
Livernois, The Times Orange County player of the year. He finished 13-3 and had 
a 2.10 earned-run average. Livernois, who also plays center field, hit .376 
with a homer and 19 runs batted in and had a team-high 13 stolen bases. . . . 
Kennedy and Rancho Alamitos also made the playoffs, but both were beaten in the 
first round. Kennedy tied for the Garden Grove League title, beating La Quinta 
twice along the way. Standings 05,17,05,05,05,06 *2*League *2*Overall School W

</P>
<P>
 In his first season, Draeger led Santiago to one of its best seasons in years. 
But Draeger had two proven pitchers last season--a luxury he doesn't have this 
time around. "Our concern is definitely pitching," Draeger said. "We don't have 
anybody who is dominant." Draeger is hoping Castaneda, who threw only a handful 
of varsity innings last year, and Wiemann will come through and be quality Nos. 
1 and 2 pitchers. On the positive side, Draeger is excited about his hitting. 
"I think we're going to hit the ball," he said. "We're not going to be hitting 
the long ball much, but I think we can be at least 7-7 (in league)." Draeger 
thinks Robledo might be his best player: "If he plays to his potential, he'll 
have a lot of people looking at him." Duran (.390), who caught nearly every 
inning last year, should be able to help the young pitchers mature. Callari, a 
transfer from Rancho Alamitos, will provide some speed in the outfield and on 
the bases.

<P>
 Only two starters are back from the Vaqueros' first playoff team since 1987, 
so it could be a rebuilding year for Osterode, who lost six all-league players. 
Luce (.340, five home runs), a second-team all-leaguer who moves from second to 
shortstop, and Osterode (.350), who caught every inning last year, will be 
asked to carry Rancho, at least early on. "We're real young," Jeff Osterode 
said. "I can't really wait for them to get better. They have to get better 
soon." Like so many other teams in the league, the Vaqueros are without any 
proven pitchers. Kozak, who was the fourth or fifth pitcher last year, will be 
the ace. That role might have gone to Trigg, another lefty, but he is 
ineligible because of grades and will miss all but the final eight games. "It 
just broke my heart when I heard he couldn't play," Osterode said. Osterode is 
also excited about Cothrell, a 6-5, 200-pound center fielder.

 When the Mariners get their basketball players (Maurer, Martinez and Alliman) 
back, they might be pretty good. But the way Pacifica's basketball team is 
playing, that might be a while. Until Maurer (the team's No. 1 pitcher who won 
four games last year) returns, Flatten will have to rely on Foley, his No. 2 
pitcher, and DePippo, his all-league catcher who batted .426 last season, to 
carry the load. Flatten is expecting big things from Brown, who sat out last 
season because of an injury, and Martinez (.315). After that, Pacifica is 
fairly inexperienced. "Our strengths are that we have a lot back, but our 
concerns are that in key spots we have some young people who will have to 
develop pretty quick," Flatten said. One of those youngsters, Stivers, will 
start at shortstop after spending most of last season on junior varsity. 
Another inexperienced player is Peters, who probably will be the team's third 
pitcher. Flatten said defense also will be a key.

 La Quinta lost four of five infield starters from last year's Southern Section 
Division III finalists, but Demarest returns five starters, including Jim 
Livernois (The Times Orange County player of the year, 13-3, 2.10 ERA) and C.J. 
Livernois, who started at second. Demarest welcomes Kuzmic, a Los Amigos 
transfer, who will start at short. The biggest loss is Granger, the starting 
catcher for four years. Linck (.303), a DH last year, will replace him. Fox, 
who played junior varsity last season, will start at third and Carlson (.326) 
moves from left to first. With Livernois and Combs (5-2, 3.08 ERA) back, the 
pitching should be strong. "Our pitching is deeper than last year and hopefully 
that will make things easier on Jimmy," Demarest said. "He's going to pitch 
quality innings. Hopefully, we're not going to be a one-dimensional team." 
Livernois (.375, 13 SB) might also catch a few innings.

 Kennedy has won or shared two consecutive Garden Grove League titles. If the 
Fighting Irish are going to win a third, they will have to find two pitchers to 
go with Clark (7-3), a first-team all-league pitcher the past two years. 
Zannitto and Tow are the candidates, but they are unproven. McDaniel is the 
only pitcher, other than Clark, with varsity experience and he threw one inning 
last season. "If Clark has to throw too many innings, he could wear down," 
Pascal said. Pascal is counting on his team's speed wearing down opponents. 
"We're going to have to run to make some things happen," he said. Center 
fielder Morris and left fielder Marino, a second-team all-league player, will 
do most of the running. Shortstop is another question mark. McDaniel, Clark and 
Garcia all could play there. "Clark started last year, but I'd like to take one 
guy and leave him there," Pascal said.

 Seven starters, six of them seniors, return from last year's last-place team. 
The experienced, but not flashy, group has Nelson excited. "We may not have the 
best athletes; we don't have anything to draw scouts," he said, "but this is 
the best group we've had in a long time. I think they'll play together. I think 
we'll surprise people. The last championship we won at Bolsa (in 1984) was with 
the kind of team we have right here." The team's unmistakable leader is 
Baughman, a first-team all-league player in football and basketball. "The next 
day after basketball ended, he's out here leading everybody," Nelson said. 
Baughman, who led the county in passing yardage this year, hasn't pitched since 
his freshman season, but he will be Nelson's ace this year. "If we'd have 
pitched him the last two years, we could have done some damage to his 
shoulder."

 The Argonauts have gone 31-15-1 the past two seasons, but the party appears to 
be over for Rawls. Five players return from last season's team and only Moreno 
(7-4, 2.47 ERA) and Lewis (.309, 12 RBIs) were starters. Rawls said he probably 
will start five sophomores. "The team we had the past three years started as 
sophomores," Rawls said. "So we're definitely trying to build something here 
for the future. I just wish we had a big-time pitcher waiting in the wings, 
like Kennedy and La Quinta, to make the transition easier, but we don't." Rawls 
said his inexperienced team will have to rely on consistency, tough defense and 
timely hitting. "Without a dominant pitcher, we'll have to play mistake-free 
baseball," he said. Since most of his players were on junior varsity and 
freshman teams last year, Rawls said he doesn't know what to expect from his 
offense. "The hitting is all untested," he said. "I have no idea what they'll 
do."

 Foreman, who took over for Ron Pruter, has begun his new job by essentially 
cleaning house. He cut four of eight seniors, and has chosen to build with 
juniors and sophomores. "I'm starting a three-year plan to gain experience for 
the next year," Foreman said. "We're promoting a positive attitude. The 
attitude has been down here for so long. I'll be satisfied if we go .500 this 
season." Foreman plans to build around his pitching, which will be led by 
Rutherford. "He was on the wild side last year, but we've worked on his 
mechanics," Foreman said. "He's developed two new pitches and he's more 
positive." Elsaesser will be the No. 2 pitcher and Contreras, a junior varsity 
catcher last season, will be No. 3. "(Elsaesser) was strictly a fastball 
pitcher last year, but now he has a slider and a split," Foreman said. 
"(Contreras) loves it. He's throwing smoke. He's 6-4 and has a cannon." While 
Los Amigos' pitching might be strong, the Lobos' offensive attack figures to be 
shaky. "We'll bunt and run because we've got speed, but pitching will keep us 
in the ball game," Foreman said. "Hoover and Bustos are the only power we've 
got."

JACKSON'S GRAND SLAM KEYS ANGEL COMEBACK; BASEBALL: HIS HOMER IN THE EIGHTH 
TIES SCORE. EDUARDO PEREZ'S TWO-RUN SINGLE BEATS ROCKIES, 7-6. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The murmur began the moment he left the on-deck circle Friday, building to a 
crescendo by the time he reached the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the scenario that creates legends, sending fans home to embellish what 
they just witnessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Designated hitter Bo Jackson stepped to the plate with the bases loaded. The 
Angels were trailing by four runs in the eighth inning. The situation called 
for a grand slam. Little else would do. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson watched rookie Marc Pisciotta throw three consecutive balls. There was 
no doubt in his mind what was coming next. 
</P>
<P>
 Pisciotta fired, and Jackson swung, sending the ball sailing over the 
right-field fence, and the Angels into a frenzy. The score was tied, and 
moments later, the Angels won on Eduardo Perez's two-run single for a 7-6 
victory over the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the Cactus League. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bo knows dramatics," Angel Manager Buck Rodgers said. "That's why you pay 
some guys $5 million and some guys $500. The minute I saw the ball, I just 
looked at the flagpole and waited for it to land. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know if we're seeing the tail end of his first career, or the 
beginning of his second one, but it's going to be fun to find out." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Angel coaching staff has three weeks to decide whether Jackson will 
make the team, its intentions became pretty obvious when Angel owner Gene Autry 
strolled into the clubhouse. He came only to meet Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's this man that I tried to sign (in 1985)?" Autry said, extending his 
hand. "That was wonderful today. Hopefully, you'll be doing the same thing in 
six months." 
</P>
<P>
 Autry started to walk away, and Jackson grinned, turned around and said, "So, 
does this mean (I have) a job?" 
</P>
<P>
 If Jackson continues these theatrics, he may not only have a job, but force 
his way into the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Little wonder why DH Chili Davis walked into the clubhouse, looked at Jackson, 
and said: "So tell me, where am I going to be traded to, Cleveland?" 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jackson: "Hey, I'm not here to impress anyone. I'm just here to try to 
obtain a job and play ball." 
</P>
<P>
 It's too late. Jackson not only mesmerized the 4,952 fans who watched Jackson 
play in his first Cactus League game, but he already has a fan club in the 
Angel clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in awe of the guy," Angel right fielder Tim Salmon said. "It's going to 
be something to have him around all year. Man, what a threat."

CASTANEDA WRESTLES WAY INTO STATE SEMIFINALS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Confidence ran high for Alemany's James Castaneda and Thousand Oaks' Tim 
Bonebright, but luck ran out on one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 In the quarterfinals of the State wrestling tournament at Pacific's Spanos 
Center Friday, Castaneda, a 112-pound junior, was the lone area athlete to 
advance to today's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaneda, who never doubted he belonged in the final four, breezed through 
his first three matches with a pin and 11-2 and 16-8 decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty happy. I'm feeling good," said Castaneda, who is 42-1 and ranked 
fourth by California Wrestler magazine. "I was hoping to finish better than 
last year," when he was fifth in the 103-pound class. 
</P>
<P>
 At 145, Bonebright easily won his opening two rounds before he advanced to 
meet Clovis senior Kyle Swan, a fourth-place finisher at 135 last year. But 
Bonebright got in trouble early and lost, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's upset. He has to regroup for (today) and a possible third place," said 
Thousand Oaks Coach Larry Mortensen. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Mortensen, it was imperative that Bonebright go on the attack 
after he fell behind against Swan: "He needed to pick up the pace, make his 
throws, do some different things. Swan sits back and waits for you to make the 
moves." 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura's Chad Payne (125) and Rio Mesa's Tom Nelford (152) won their first two 
matches before they were stopped in the third round. Payne was an 11-1 loser to 
Monache's Brad Hull and Madera's Fernando Meza turned back Nelford, 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Canoga Park's Hadi Jubrail (160), the champion from the City Section, and 
Ventura's Sean Burdick, a sixth-place finisher in the Southern Section Masters 
meet, lost in Round 2. KIM Q. BERKSHIRE

 Market Overview * The stock market climbed Friday, given a boost by a positive 
February employment report and steadier long-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Short-term Treasury securities prices were hammered by speculation that 
interest rates will be pushed higher soon, but long-term bonds barely budged. 
</P>
<P>
 * The volatile bond market and strong economic report propelled the dollar 
solidly higher. Markets 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street's advance was broadly based, with a wide range of stocks 
participating. But the Dow Jones industrial average and more comprehensive 
market measures finished below their best levels of the session. 
</P>
<P>
 After rising more than 20 points in morning action, the Dow industrials ended 
7.88 points higher at 3,832.30 and concluded the week down 6.48 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, advances outpaced declines by 3 to 1 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 311.85 million shares, up from Thursday's 
291.96 million. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong showing by technology stocks made for a solid performance by the 
Nasdaq stock market. Its composite index of mostly smaller stocks added 5.97 
points to 790.55, giving it a 6.77-point gain for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock investors focused on the promising aspects of the Labor Department's 
report that showed the nation's unemployment rate dipped an unexpected 
two-tenths of a percentage point to 6.5% last month as non-farm payrolls 
expanded by 217,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate report showed the government's chief economic forecasting gauge 
rose a modest 0.3% in January, suggesting that economic growth will continue 
this year but at a more moderate pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Managed health care company TakeCare and health maintenance organization 
operator FHP International signed a $1.1-billion merger agreement. TakeCare 
rose 7 7/8 to 75 1/4 while FHP dropped 1 3/4 to 26 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto stocks were strong after reporting gains in February car sales 
Thursday. Ford rose 1 1/2 to 65 1/8, Chrysler added 1 1/2 to 59 1/2 and General 
Motors ended up 1 1/2 to 62. 
</P>
<P>
 * Calgene fell 1 1/2 to end at $10.50 after the Food and Drug Administration 
postponed a review of its genetically engineered tomato. 
</P>
<P>
 * Intel rose 1 5/8 to 69 5/8, Cisco Systems advanced 2 1/4 to 79 and Sun 
Microsystems gained 1 1/4 to 29 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Proffitt's jumped 4 to 23 3/4 after it announced it was merging with another 
specialty department store, McRae's Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gibraltar Steel gained 7/8 to 15 1/8. Salomon Bros. issued a "buy" rating on 
the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks also moved ahead on major foreign markets, including Tokyo, where the 
225-share Nikkei average closed up 360.14 points at 19,966.00. In Frankfurt, 
the DAX 30-share average ended at 2,060.09, up 22.19 points, and London's 
Financial Times 100-share average finished 31.5 points higher at 3,278.0. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index gained 7.59 points to close at 2,569.52. Other 
Markets 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market's concern was aroused by warnings on Wall Street that the 
central bank may act swiftly to quell uncertainty in the financial markets, 
following its interest rate hike Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's failure to lift interest rates again Friday -- despite the release 
of the Labor Department's closely watched employment report -- merely 
intensified the guessing game. 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, the price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond yield was 
unchanged from Thursday at 6.83%, while its price edged up 1/16 point, or 63 
cents per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 However, prices of shorter-term maturities dropped. Short-term Treasury 
securities fell between 1/8 point and 3/16 point, and intermediate maturities 
fell between 5/32 point and 3/16 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information 
service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury bills were hit even harder, with yields rising sharply, since the Fed 
targets short-term interest rates in its monetary policy actions. Higher rates 
on new securities would erode the value of already sold bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in currency trading, the greenback's strongest moves came against 
the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar fetched 105.50 Japanese yen, up from 103.80 on 
Thursday. It rose to 1.719 German marks, up from 1.710. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, gold prices fell on the New York Comex to $377.60 an ounce, up 30 
cents from Thursday. Silver brought $5.239, off 0.2 cent.

 This is the first time Kilpatrick, a Los Angeles County-funded facility for 
youth offenders, has fielded a baseball team. With one senior and no juniors, 
winning games in the Mustangs' inaugural season will be tough. But Freeman, a 
former professional baseball player, has assured the Mustangs that if they pay 
attention to his instruction, they'll come out winners. "I told them as long as 
they listen, we'll be all right," said Freeman, who was an assistant at Culver 
City last season. Griegos, who also played on the Mustangs' football and 
basketball teams, will be the ace. Montclair Prep 03,12,04,09 '93 RECORD

 Steele knows the meaning of "feast or famine." Last season, all but one 
starter was experienced and the Mounties enjoyed a successful season. A year 
later, only two starters return and Steele is left to fill the void with youth 
and inexperience. "We're gonna have to be patient," Steele said. Gone is Brad 
Fullmer and his region-leading 15 home runs and 62 RBIs. What's left is Dent 
and Parker, who put up some impressive numbers in 1993. Last season Dent hit 
.421 with 41 runs scored, nine doubles, three home runs, 21 RBIs and 27 stolen 
bases. Parker batted .370 with five doubles, 19 RBIs and 22 stolen bases.

<P>
 Sass is the franchise player. Last season he led the team in batting (.444), 
runs (21), hits (32), doubles (6), triples (2) and stolen bases (24). Maloney 
would like to move him from shortstop to center field, but that depends on the 
progress of Dianella or Lemonte, the middle infielders from the junior varsity. 
"We have plenty of pitchers," Maloney said, "but we have zero pitching." 
Although the lineup seems solid, expect another long season unless one of the 
Charger pitchers steps up. Camarillo 03,12,09,08 '93 RECORD OVERALL LEAGUE 7-18

<P>
 The Scorpions could start returning players at eight positions, with Kaup 
being the only exception. He split the season between the varsity and junior 
varsity last year. Of those returnees, only Spahr (.341) batted higher than 
.300 last year, but Willard is optimistic about their defense. Niremberg, 
Muller and Guyler will battle for the catching job, but all three likely will 
be in the lineup somewhere. Bourget and Valencia were the 1-2 pitching combo 
for the JV, and they could be the top two. If they come through, Camarillo 
should compete for a playoff spot. Channel Islands 03,12,09,08 '93 RECORD

</P>
<P>
 River and Sanchez are the top starting pitchers. River allowed two runs in 15 
innings near the end of last season. Sanchez, a third-year varsity player, 
pitched mostly in relief last year and picked up one save. Oliveras started at 
shortstop as a sophomore, then missed last season for academic reasons. Boyd 
also will get a chance to play shortstop. In a late call-up last season, Boyd 
had 17 assists without an error in one game. The Raiders are a good defensive 
team with speed that will, like everyone else, need pitching to contend.

 Fabricius wants Clinton and Smith to platoon, with one playing shortstop while 
the other is pitching. Smith, who has signed to play football at Arizona, was 
7-4, 2.88 last year and Clinton was 7-1, 4.60. If playing shortstop affects 
either player's pitching, Cassaro will start at shortstop instead. Bennett, an 
all-league catcher last year, hit .358. Smith batted .347 and his 18 RBIs are 
the most among returnees. Most league coaches agree the Panthers will be the 
main threat to unseat Simi Valley as league champion. Royal 03,12,09,08 '93

</P>
<P>
 Joel Mellinger (.388) and Fernandez (.352) are the top returning hitters. The 
pitching should be strong, led by Vicari, the only pitcher to beat Simi Valley 
in a league game last season. Vicari was 5-1 with a 2.92 ERA. Kramer, a hard 
thrower who will be the No. 2 starter, was 2-1 with a 3.97 ERA and 35 
strikeouts in 37 innings. Derryman, who finished last season with the JV after 
starting with the varsity, fills out a senior pitching staff. Team speed is 
another strength. Royal finished behind Simi Valley and Newbury Park last year, 
and could be in for the same. Simi Valley 03,12,09,08 '93 RECORD OVERALL LEAGUE

<P>
 Not much of the team that advanced to the Southern Section Division I final 
remains. Scheffels, the most complete pitcher in Ventura County, was 11-2 with 
a 1.17 ERA last year. Scyphers is high on Celusta and Kozlowski, who were on 
the varsity but didn't pitch much last year. Celusta throws harder than 
Kozlowski or Scheffels, and he may be the closer. The lineup will be led by 
Hankins, who hit .500 with 12 home runs and 57 RBIs last year. The lineup is 
weaker than last year's, but Scyphers expects the pitching to carry the team 
deep into the playoffs. Thousand Oaks 03,12,09,08 '93 RECORD OVERALL LEAGUE

 The Lancers feature something rare this year in the Marmonte League: 
left-handed pitching. Downing (5-3, 3.09 ERA) was an all-league selection last 
year. Weathers had some dominating outings for the junior varsity. Baron, the 
top right-hander, was 4-3 with a 3.75 ERA. The up-the-middle combination of 
Aguilar (.390, three home runs and 24 RBIs) and Elam (.325, 20 stolen bases) is 
the strength of the defense and offense. The Lancers should fall into a logjam 
in the middle of the league. Westlake 03,12,09,08 '93 RECORD OVERALL LEAGUE

 Singleton (1-8, 4.17 ERA) and Flanagan (4-5, 4.08) were the top starters last 
season. Morris also may pitch. He was one of the most improved players over the 
summer, posting a 1.57 ERA in American Legion. Davidson pitched 27 innings, 
mostly in relief, and had a 3.11 ERA. The pitching should be strong, but none 
of the returning players provided much offense last season. Herrera is 
nonetheless optimistic. "We're going to need to find room for a lot of guys," 
he said. Stick the Warriors in the middle of the league race unless they can 
score some runs.

 The Indians' field was spared of any quake damage though the rest of the

Indians have 19 players and only six are seniors. Kmet (5-foot-11, 170 pounds) 
is expected to lead the team on the mound. The right-hander was the Indians' 
best pitcher two years ago, but he had an off year in '93. Perez (5-9, 150), a 
control pitcher with a strong curve, and Arguiello will also pitch a lot. Glenn 
is a solid catcher with a good arm and a strong bat. He hit .340 last season

 Eight starters return from last year's team that tied for fourth in the 
league, so the Eagles figure to have a good season. Orme will be a key to the 
team's success. The 6-foot-4, 203-pound senior is the Eagles' top pitcher and 
hitter. He batted .250 last season as the designated hitter and went 3-1 on the 
mound. When he's not pitching, Orme will play at first base. Cote (6-1, 175) 
hit .369, including four home runs and 19 RBIs. Giovannettone (5-8, 165) batted 
.348 and Lohman (6-1, 170) hit .295. Crecion, also the team's best reliever, 
will move from right field to catcher. He led Chaminade with 40 strikeouts in 
52 innings last season while hitting .288. Crecion's brother, Gabe, also will 
pitch and play first base. The 6-4, 200-pound sophomore was 3-3 on the mound 
last year. Crespi 03,12,09,08 '93 RECORD OVERALL LEAGUE 27-3 14-0 02,14,06

 Crespi lost a lot of players from last year's team that made it to the 
Division I semifinals, but the Celts' offense remains intact. Crespi has three 
of the area's best hitters in Wright, Farlow and Glendenning. Wright, a 
left-hander, batted .420 last season with 22 RBIs. Wright, an All-Southern 
Section pick, also will play in the outfield. Farlow, a left-hander and an 
all-league selection, hit .375 with 23 RBIs. Glendenning sat out last season 
because he was academically ineligible, but he is an impact player who is 
expected to be drafted in June. Clemons didn't pitch much last season, but is 
the top hurler. He went 2-0 with a 2.88 ERA two years ago. Harvard-Westlake

 The Wolverines' offense will be centered around Schaeffer, who signed a letter 
of intent to play at Stanford and will probably be drafted in June. Schaeffer 
hit .428 last season with 21 RBIs, six triples and four home runs. He also 
scored 21 runs and walked 24 times. Brink says Anderson should hit better than 
last season when he batted .229 and scored 19 runs. Harvard-Westlake's strength 
will be defense and pitching. Garson, a left-hander, had a 2-5 record last year 
with a 5.20 ERA. He struck out 43 in 59 innings and Brink says he has improved. 
Isaacson and Kramer also will pitch a lot. Isaacson was promoted from the 
junior varsity midway through last season and compiled a 1-2 mark with a 5.30 
ERA. Kramer made 18 appearances in 23 games. Notre Dame 03,12,09,08 '93 RECORD

 The Knights lost several key players from last year's team that made it to the 
semifinals of the Division I playoffs. Igou, a left-hander who signed with the 
University of San Francisco, is the team's top returnee. He had a 4-2 record as 
the Knights' No. 2 pitcher in '93 and is being watched by pro scouts. Junior 
left-hander Andy Lutz and freshman Juan Montez will also pitch a lot. Orlando 
and Craigwell are the top hitters. Orlando, a second-team all-league pick, led 
the Knights with a .400 batting average. Craigwell is a powerful hitter and 
tough defensive player.

 The Bulldogs' one obvious strength can be found in an area where many other 
teams have concern: pitching. Alvarez, Garcia and Sindle have impressed 
Nammack. On the flip side, Burbank's outfield will be manned by inexperienced 
players and Nammack is going with a sophomore shortstop. The offense will be 
devoid of power and will rely on team speed. Burroughs 03,12,09,08 '93 RECORD

 After serving four seasons as an assistant, Valle inherits a team deep in 
pitching and experience. The defense is strong up the middle with the return of 
Centeno and Fernandez, two second-team all-leaguers who batted in the low .300s 
last year. Centeno, Bassett, a power hitter, and Delgado are third-year 
starters. The pitching staff will be bolstered by Mena, a transfer from 
Providence who is a three-time All-Southern Section selection. Canyon

 What the Cowboys might be lacking in punch at the plate, they can 
counterbalance with low line scores. Some reliable fielders will back up an 
armed force of six pitchers, much improved and led by 6-foot-6, 210-pound 
right-hander Solomon. Canyon has a pair of left-handers in McDermott and 
Engbrecht, a rare commodity. "The team that's most consistent will win the 
league," Willis said. "We'll make the routine play 99% of the time." Hart

 The two-time defending league champs have five returning starters and enough 
new stock to get it done again. Miyata is a four-year starter. Adachi, Dean and 
Espy hit for power and average. Murray believes the 6-3 Dean and Sanchez are 
pro prospects. "We got one of the best pitchers (Sanchez) in the whole valley," 
Murray said. "If we get a couple other guys to do an adequate job, we'll be 
OK." Saugus 03,12,09,08 '93 RECORD OVERALL LEAGUE 15-10 5-7 * 02,13,06 COACH

 Even with the loss of Chad New, who hit .474 last season then moved to Oregon, 
the Centurions have several returnees whose incentive is to return to the 
playoffs after missing the cut for the first time in 11 seasons. Cato hit .368 
last year. Left-hander Rogers, a 6-4 prospect, and Hernandez had ERAs of 2.15 
and 2.23. Maggiora, a sidearm pitcher, was 6-2. The only possible weakness 
could be confidence. Said Worley: "We were timid last year."

 Melcher is the top returning player. He hit .441 and earned all-league and 
All-Ventura County honors. A left-hander, Melcher might also pitch. Stehle 
(2-3, 2.60 ERA) and Rodriguez (4-1, 4.08) will be the top pitchers. They will 
need to pitch well, because Hedegard is not optimistic about his club's 
offense. Besides Melcher, Kimball, Guzman and Williams also are returning 
starters. Hebert was the varsity backup. "If all those guys come through," 
Hedegard said, "we'll be in good shape." Hueneme 03,12,09,08 '93 RECORD OVERALL

<P>
 The brevity of the above list tells you all you need to know about the 
Vikings. A week before the season, only 12 players were on the squad. Of the 
returnees, Ralston is the best. He led the team with 28 RBIs and a .341 batting 
average last year. Flores (.302, 24 stolen bases) is moving from third base. 
Bolen, who played sparingly last season, is considered the strongest player on 
the team. Welker will be replacing all three outfielders. "We're going to be 
real green," he said. "As green as the grass. Hopefully we'll be competitive, 
but you never know." Oxnard 03,12,09,08 '93 RECORD OVERALL LEAGUE 8-13 5-9

<P>
 The Yellowjackets don't return much, but Canales is the best. Dalton said he 
is the team's best hitter and best pitcher. The other half of the starting 
rotation will be Gutierrez, who is 6-foot-2 and has a good fastball. Gutierrez 
didn't play baseball last year and Dalton admitted he's not sure why. Mendoza 
(.395 for the junior varsity) and Ibarra (.390) were the top hitters for the JV 
last year, and they will start in the outfield. If Canales and Gutierrez pitch 
well, the Yellowjackets may contend. Otherwise, the team is probably too 
inexperienced. Rio Mesa 03,12,09,08 '93 RECORD OVERALL LEAGUE 10-14 4-10

</P>
<P>
 The Spartans finished in last place a year ago, but they are certain to 
improve because of so many returnees. Duran can complete his lineup with 
players who started last year. DiDomizio has not pitched much, but Duran is 
planning to hand him the ball on a regular basis. Smith, a first-year varsity 
player, may be the sleeper of the pitching staff. Among the regulars, Flores 
(.391) is the most accomplished. He was an all-county pick as a sophomore. 
Swanger has great potential. Expect Rio Mesa to challenge for one of the 
league's top spots if the pitching is good. Ventura 03,12,09,08 '93 RECORD

 Moritz will rotate between shortstop and pitcher. "I'm looking for big things 
from him," Smith said. He hit .405 and was 5-7 with a 3.45 ERA. The number of 
returnees is deceptive, though. Some of the returnees were only part-time 
players last year, such as Aragon and Casey. And Perez missed much of the year 
with arm problems. "Our returning seniors have to play like good seniors," 
Smith said. "Our JV kids are going to have to pick it up a notch."

 With five returning starters, the team's strength will be pitching. Parque

hurlers. Parque, a left-hander, had five complete games last season and he 
finished with a 6-4 record and a 1.88 ERA. Lee was 5-5 with a 2.77 ERA. Hagge 
and Canale are expected to lead the team's offense. Last season Hagge, a lefty, 
hit .358 and Canale .444. French, a first team all-league pick in '93, batted 
.302 as a first baseman. Glendale 03,12,09,08 '93 RECORD OVERALL LEAGUE 12-11

 Only four starters are back from last year's team that upset Long Beach 
Millikan in the first round of the playoffs. Glendale lacks depth, and a 
last-minute roster reduction hurt the Dynamiters even more. Senior third 
baseman Neal Sowter and senior catcher Guy Blackwell were recently excused from 
the team for violating the school's athletic agreement. Gantt, a third-team 
All-CIF pick last season who also plays third base, should be the Dynamiters' 
top pitcher. He went 9-4 with a 2.22 ERA. Boger was Glendale's top hitter 
(.320) in '93 and is expected to lead the team at the plate again. Hoover

 The defending league champions are legitimate contenders this year though it 
will be tough to replace catcher Nate Dishington, who was drafted by the 
Cardinals in the second round. Pirayoff (6-foot-1, 180 pounds) will move to 
fill the void. He played third base last season and hit .450. Cooper says 
defense will be one of the Tornadoes' biggest strengths. One of Hoover's 
biggest assets is de La Pena (6-0, 190), who is stronger after gaining 20 
pounds in the off-season. He had an 8-1 record in '93 and will also play at 
shortstop. Butler (6-1, 170) and Solis (6-0, 160) should be two of the team's 
best hitters.

 Fillmore lost eight starters from last season and Ecklund is not ready to tout 
the Flashes for title contention, but other coaches in the league aren't as 
wary. The road to the crown is Highway 126. Pitching will be the key. Fillmore 
has five right-handers and one lefty--none overpowering. "What I'm really 
looking for is three guys to say, 'Give me the ball,' " Ecklund said. "Then 
we'll settle in." The defense is unsettled, but the offense has the potential 
to be explosive. Oak Park 03,12,09,08 '93 RECORD OVERALL LEAGUE 7-13 4-8

Montenegro .387, Molina .350 and Buck .342. Tauber hit .492 in varsity spot

play. Will all the pieces fit together? And will the pitching staff overcome 
control problems, unlike last year? St. Bonaventure lost two games last year 
because of bases-loaded walks.

valuable player, is the veteran ace and workhorse. Last season, Hernandez went

too many games," Henzie said. Spielman, who batted .408 with nine RBIs, is the 
only starter who hit better than .300. Robitaille (5-2), who had 40 strikeouts

 The Saints' biggest asset could be the return of Lorenzana, who produced two 
league titles and led Santa Clara to the playoffs in eight of nine seasons in a 
previous coaching stint. It remains to be seen if Maciel, who hit .395, will 
have much of a supporting cast on offense. Santa Paula 03,12,09,08 '93 RECORD

 The Cardinals would appear in best shape of any team in the league. They were

Paula went 12-0 at home, 0-10 on the road last season.

 The Antelopes have one of the most experienced teams in the league, led by

returning will be Langham, who was academically ineligible for the final four 
games last season, all of which Antelope Valley lost to fall out of the 
playoffs. Barlow, a freshman, will get the nod at shortstop, taking over for 
graduated Eric Cole (.480). T'Sas is excited about the potential of sophomore 
Cooke, who hit over .500 last year on the freshman team. "He might be a real

 This is a team for the future. Twelve seniors--including all nine

"It's a very young team," he said. "We brought everybody up from the jayvee and 
freshman teams." Surprisingly, the team's strength figures to be pitching. 
Castillo, then a freshman, played on the varsity at the end of last season and 
was 3-0 with a 1.96 ERA. Freshman Carlos Chavez greatly impressed the coaches 
last week by striking out five and shutting out Saugus in three innings of 
scrimmage work. Mia, also a sophomore, will share time on the mound. "We're 
going to throw them to the wolves," Van Cheri said. "It's going to be a 
completely unknown quantity. I don't even know what we're going to be like."

Littlerock junior varsity last season. He is counting on his returnees to 
provide leadership to several newcomers--Reed, Jefferson and Hangee--who for 
various reasons were unable to play baseball last year. Silva, who was very

Payton (.338, 14 SB). "I think if our pitching comes along here, we should be

 Quartz Hill lost most of its starters from a league championship team, but the 
Rebels should again contend because of their pitching. They now have a new 
secret weapon--Worley. The 6-foot-3, 185-pounder is much improved. "He's 
throwing the ball much stronger this year," Nielson said. Goss is the Rebels' 
second starter and one of the team's top hitters. "He's a kid who could 
potentially put up some eye-popping numbers," Nielson said.

 Vera has guided Verdugo Hills--a league doormat before he took over--to 17

challenge yet. With only three starters returning, Vera says, "I'll need 
miracles." The Dons last season finished second in league play behind Franklin, 
which is favored to repeat as champion. With so much inexperience, Vera has his 
work cut out for him. "It's a battling team," he said. "If they get together as 
a team, they could be good." Vera is hoping Schmidt and Flores will provide the 
leadership the Dons need to be competitive.

 Youth will be served at Cleveland--Landress doesn't have a choice. 
Fortunately, several of the six sophomores who likely will start are good ones. 
Roth is a 6-foot-3, 190-pound catcher who played junior varsity last season, 
and whose strength and talent has impressed Landress. Brignac (6-2, 170) played 
varsity as a freshman last season. Elzy should be the team's top pitcher. He 
will share time on the mound with Williams, and the one who isn't pitching will 
play in the outfield. Bateman and Schultz will round out the staff. Delgado 
also will be a key player. Granada Hills 03,12,09,08 '93 RECORD OVERALL LEAGUE

 The Highlanders are not near the level of consensus conference favorites 
Chatsworth and El Camino Real, but Stroh hopes to battle Kennedy for the North 
Valley League title. Granada Hills' key player is Landress (.348, three home 
runs, 19 RBIs), a college and professional prospect. The 6-0, 180-pound 
shortstop is a good hitter, runs well and possesses a fine arm. "He's got 
everything it takes to be a fine, fine player," Stroh said. Penwarden and 
Torres are two newcomers who should help the team immediately. Goldberg was the 
team's top pitcher last year, but is recovering from tendinitis. Mandell could 
be the staff's ace. Kennedy 03,12,09,08 '93 RECORD OVERALL LEAGUE 24-3 14-3 *

 Kennedy was loaded with offensive talent a year ago, but its big run producers 
have graduated. Alvarado expects Connolly (.365, 13 RBI), Prieto (.328), Kassis 
and Serr to fill that gap, but says this year's team will not feel much 
pressure. "There's not a whole lot of high expectations on these guys," 
Alvarado said. "Last year's team felt like they had to win everything." One 
reason for the reduced expectations is a pitching staff with no significant 
varsity experience. Senior pitchers Cooperman and Echeverria were little-used 
reserves last year. Soto has lots of potential. San Fernando 03,12,09,08 '93

 Heim takes over for Steve Marden, who retired after 17 seasons. He inherits 
one of the most experienced teams in the conference, with seven of nine 
starters returning. Cabrera (.381, 12 RBIs) is a spray hitter who will bat in 
the second or third slot. Heim said that leadoff hitter Rodriguez is the 
fastest and most talented player on the team. As with many teams, pitching is 
the Tigers' major question mark. Padilla and Avila played on the junior varsity 
last year and Gamboa is a transfer from Sylmar. Heim said that Cabrera, Orozco 
and Barragan also will pitch.

 Brown makes Birmingham a cut above an average team. Despite his 3-5 record 
last season, Brown threw seven complete games and finished with a 2.41 ERA. In 
61 innings, he struck out 52 and walked only 18. "Control is one of his strong 
suits," Weber said. "He's a smart pitcher." Of the five returning starters, 
only Rodriguez (.311, 10 RBIs) hit above .300. Wingo, the Braves' No. 2 ace, 
had 10 RBIs and two home runs last season. In order for Birmingham to compete 
for a playoff spot, the Braves will have to hit more consistently than last

 The Hunters are 10-67 in the 1990s. Six of those wins came last season. Four

problem, said Smith, who worries most about the Hunters offensively. "Our 
hitting let us down last year," Smith said. "We only had one guy batting over

pitchers. Monroe 03,12,09,08 '93 RECORD OVERALL LEAGUE 20-5 15-2 02,16,06 COACH

 Zamudio is being hailed as one of the top three pitchers in the region. He 
throws in the upper 80s miles per hour and last year struck out 81 in 64 
innings. Zamudio finished 7-1 with a 1.64 ERA. Unfortunately for Zamudio, he 
will be surrounded by only two other returning starters, Dorado and Rojo, at 
shortstop and second base. Zamudio also was the Vikings' top batter last 
season, hitting .462 with nine doubles and 27 RBIs. Zamudio suffered with back 
problems through the latter part of the season. He will have to remain healthy 
for Monroe to repeat as league champion. "He's the guy we have to have to be 
competitive," Campbell said. Van Nuys 03,12,09,08 '93 RECORD OVERALL LEAGUE

 Friery coached the junior varsity to a league title last year and is hoping 
the Wolves' winning ways continue on the varsity. Five returning starters will 
help Van Nuys compete for a playoff berth. Bolivar emerged as the Wolves' ace 
last season. He finished 4-7, but sported a 1.90 ERA and struck out 65 in 77 
1/3 innings. Bolivar, who hit .438 in 32 at-bats, also was Van Nuys' top 
batter. To be fundamentally sound in all areas of the game is Friery's No. 1 
goal. As for predicting the league race, Friery won't do it. "I'm gonna take a 
wait-and-see attitude right now," he said.

 The Contenders will be young, but have experience in the Carpenter brothers

Rodgers and Bailey bring speed to the top of the lineup. Weiss doesn't expect 
to unseat Crossroads as the league champion, but third place is a realistic 
possibility. Five players transferred over the past school year, but Weiss 
expects minimal impact from the losses.

 "I think Chatsworth is without a doubt the best team in the City," Granada 
Hills Coach Darryl Stroh said. He won't get many arguments. The Chancellors 
lost the City 4-A championship to El Camino Real by one run and return almost 
their entire starting lineup. "Talent-wise we match up with anyone in the 
City," Meusborn said. "Whether or not we have the chemistry, I don't know." 
LaCour (.448, 16 doubles) is one of the top players in the area and has signed 
with Stanford. DeBiase (12-4, 2.39 ERA) and Kenoi (6-1, 2.36) are two of the

the year. But only two other starters from last year's team return: speedy 
center fielder Martin and 6-3 lefty Carlton. "We've got to find some hitters," 
Maio said. "We can't do it with just those three guys returning." Where exactly 
that hitting will come from, Maio is unsure, as he scans the inexperienced

 The Regents have won only one conference game in the past two seasons. "We're 
in as tough a conference as there is," Stone said. "We don't have the depth 
that a Chatsworth or an El Camino Real does. Hopefully we'll give everybody a 
game and maybe win a couple in the process." The Regents' best player is Carlos 
Nunez (.387, 5 HR, 15 RBI), a four-year starter who Stone said has potential to 
be drafted. He and Macillas will share pitching duties, and Cooper, a transfer 
from L.A. Baptist, will fill in at their infield positions. Five starters 
return, including Ben Nunez, Carlos' brother. Taft 03,12,09,08 '93 RECORD

 The Toreadors lost nine seniors to graduation and return only one full-time 
starter, Ferguson. He has been moved from center field to shortstop this season 
and will also see pitching duty. Ferguson was the quarterback of the football 
team and suffered a dislocated shoulder near the end of that season, but has 
recovered, McKeon said. Helman is much improved since last year and probably 
will bat third. Cook, Venger and Collins head a talented group of juniors whom 
McKeon thinks will really blossom next year. Cook is the team's No. 1 pitcher, 
and Collins will likely be one of its top hitters.

 The Spirits have only two seniors on the team, and only one of them starts. On 
the bright side, the junior varsity team was 17-3 last season and won the 
league championship. Winchell hit .429 last year and was an all-league 
selection.

 Lawrence, the Lancers' third coach in as many years, has his work cut out for 
him in his debut season. Four starters return for the Lancers, but none hit 
better than .300 last season. To make matters worse, none of the returnees are 
pitchers. However, Lawrence said he has seven pitching prospects. "We'll go as 
far as our pitching allows us," Lawrence said. Offensively, Lawrence said, the 
Lancers are sound. "We don't have a weak link in our lineup as far as hitting 
goes." Eleven of the 17 players on the roster are seniors. North Hollywood

 Seven starters return from a team that showed marked improvement from the 
previous season. The Huskies finished a paltry 2-20 in 1992. Talamantes, who 
hit a team-high .422 with four triples and 15 RBIs last season, is one of three 
returning starters in the outfield. Beside him will be Ramos (.408) and Cabrera 
(.380, 11 stolen bases) in right. Pitchers Fields, Sandoval and Delano, a 
left-hander, also return, but pitching was not a strength a year ago. Fields 
(4-1) had 32 strikeouts in 28 1/3 innings and finished with a team-best 3.21 
ERA. Zavala (.395) is a veteran catcher and Zuniga (12 RBIs) is a three-year 
starter at first base. The Huskies should challenge for a playoff berth. "We 
have some talented kids," Pally said. "We have the opportunity." Poly

 The Parrots took their knocks in the early part of the season a year ago. Poly 
was outscored, 55-8, in the first five games. But the Parrots rebounded nicely 
to finish in second place in the league behind Sylmar. With seven starters back 
for Poly, this season promises to be much different. Poly and Sylmar, which 
provide the best rivalry in the conference, should once again renew that 
competitiveness. Dorame, who hit .410 as a designated hitter last year, will 
move to third base. Delgado (eight doubles, 12 RBIs), Cuevas (17 RBIs) and 
Cerna all batted above .325. Schwal expects more of the same from them and 
believes five others will join the .300 club. Sanchez and Delgado will anchor 
the pitching staff. Sylmar 03,12,09,08 '93 RECORD OVERALL LEAGUE 20-8 15-2 *

 Sylmar has the top pitcher in the league in Velazco, who finished 11-1 with an 
0.96 ERA, best among area City pitchers. Velazco had 51 strikeouts in 73 
innings. Diaz, who batted .316 with eight doubles and 16 RBIs, is the Spartans' 
best offensive weapon. Sylmar has four returning starters and probably will 
start three sophomores, but Donatella figures the Spartans will repeat as 
league champs. "I already told our guys, if we don't win the league, it will be 
a disappointing year," he said.

STAR-GAZING AND AFI: IT'S A FACT, JACK; MOVIES: WHO'S WHO OF HOLLYWOOD TURN OUT 
TO HONOR TWO-TIME OSCAR WINNER NICHOLSON AND HIS FIVE-DECADE CAREER. 'I'M 
TOUCHED AND I'M FORTUNATE,' HE SAID.

 "You ain't seen nothing yet!" said a visibly moved Jack Nicholson at the 
climax of the American Film Institute's "Life Achievement Award" tribute to his 
career Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The remark drew an ovation from one of the more luminous crowds in recent 
Hollywood memory, many of whom have participated in the 57-year-old actor's 
five-decade film career that has already been highlighted with the best actor 
Oscar for 1975's "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and the supporting actor 
Oscar for 1983's "Terms of Endearment." 
</P>
<P>
 A few moments earlier, Nicholson, known for his "cool" independence and wry 
humor, said: "I'm touched and I'm fortunate. And I'm lucky to be at large." It 
was a comment that filled the International Ballroom of the Beverly Hilton with 
nervous laughter because the last reference was to misdemeanor vandalism and 
assault charges brought against him earlier this week by the Los Angeles city 
attorney's office for allegedly smashing the windshield of a car with a golf 
club. Nicholson thought the driver of that vehicle had cut him off in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor arrived only seconds before the program began and was rushed into 
the hotel's back entrance to avoid the scores of cameras and press gathered in 
the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson's "at large" comment was the only direct reference to the 
misdemeanor charges. However, golf jokes were a recurring theme. Sean Penn, who 
is directing Nicholson in the currently shooting "The Crossing Guard," arrived 
on stage with a golf putter that sported a medieval weapon attached. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn said he didn't realize he would end up directing Nicholson in a role that 
he originally envisioned for a younger actor. So, in introducing preview clips 
of the movie, Penn apologized for a sedentary performance. What the audience 
saw, however, was Nicholson in a rage and fighting mad. 
</P>
<P>
 While the previous 21 AFI tributes have had their starry audiences, the 
honorees, such as Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, Henry Fonda and Alfred 
Hitchcock, were always film veterans past the peak of their careers. With 
Nicholson, still one of Hollywood's major players today, the turnout of 
celebrities was astonishing and a good indicator of what real "power" in 
Hollywood can mean. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a "hip" evening as well, with the audience donning sunglasses, one of 
Nicholson's trademarks, as the actor entered the ballroom. True to form, he was 
wearing sunglasses that he rarely took off during the show, taped by CBS for a 
one-hour special airing Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the actor's table, alone, was a who's who of some of the famous woman in 
his career and life: Louise Fletcher, Cher, Kathleen Turner, Mary Steenburgen, 
Rebecca Broussard, Candice Bergen, Shirley MacLaine, Madeleine Stowe, Faye 
Dunaway, Shelley Duvall and Ellen Burstyn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's well-wishers included Warren Beatty, who starred in and directed 
Nicholson in 1981's much Oscar-nominated "Reds," and Robert Evans, the producer 
of 1974's multi-Oscar nominated "Chinatown," in which Nicholson received his 
first star billing. 
</P>
<P>
 There were tributes by Dustin Hoffman, Hector Babenco, Michael Keaton and 
childhood friend from New Jersey, Danny DeVito. Also speaking were Mike 
Nichols, who directed Nicholson in 1971's controversial "Carnal Knowledge" and 
the upcoming "Wolf," and Michael Douglas, one of the producers of "Cuckoo's 
Nest."  
</P>
<P>
 MacLaine said Nicholson has been her acting hero since she saw the famous 
comedic scene in "Five Easy Pieces" in which Nicholson orders toast at a cafe 
that doesn't have it on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Clips were shown of Nicholson's performances, ranging from his screen debut at 
age 21 in Roger Corman's 1958 "The Cry Baby Killer" to his upcoming June movie, 
"Wolf," for which he is reportedly receiving $10 million to $12 million in 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper recalled that when they cast Nicholson in their 
breakthrough 1969 movie "Easy Rider," it was for one very good reason: He would 
work for scale. At that time the salary was $392 per week. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though his work can now command millions, Nicholson will still work for 
scale. He is reportedly taking only current scale wages of $485 per week for 
the Penn movie, which is being produced by Miramax Films. 
</P>
<P>
 Thurday night's Nicholson fan club included songwriters Joni Mitchell and Bob 
Dylan, actresses Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the 
now-retired center of Nicholson's beloved basketball team, the Los Angeles 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Garfunkel, who appeared with Nicholson in "Carnal Knowledge," and Harry 
Dean Stanton, who was in "Missouri Breaks" with Nicholson, recalled one 
particular time when all three were driving to Dallas and singing Everly 
Brothers songs. In honor of that, Garfunkel and Stanton began to sing "All I 
Have to Do Is Dream." The wobbly rendition soon took on a life of its own and 
the entire audience joined in.
