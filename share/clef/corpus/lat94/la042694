POWELL SAYS HE CAME CLOSE TO SHOOTING KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA DEUTSCH, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the policemen sent to prison for beating Rodney G. King testified 
Monday that he acted correctly, adding that King was so out of control that he 
came close to shooting him. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurence M. Powell, who struck the most nightstick blows during the March 3, 
1991, beating, was called as a hostile witness in King's civil lawsuit. He 
testified after arriving from a prison in Northern California where he is 
serving a 30-month sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Milton Grimes, King's principal attorney, complained at one point that Powell, 
who seemed aggressive throughout his testimony, was making speeches rather than 
answering questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, jurors awarded $3.8 million to King in compensatory damages for his 
injuries. The jurors are now considering punitive damages against Powell and 14 
other defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't think you did anything wrong that night?" Grimes asked Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I not only don't think it. I know it," Powell replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes asked if Powell had come close to shooting King to death. Powell said 
he had come "very close." 
</P>
<P>
 "If he got up and attacked me one more time, it was going to be a shooting 
situation," Powell said. "I could not control him." 
</P>
<P>
 King was beaten after a high-speed police chase when he refused to stop his 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge John G. Davies refused to intercede when Grimes accused 
Powell of using the witness stand to preach about his views on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 But Davies did rule that a controversial message Powell sent the night of the 
beating was admissible. In the message, Powell referred to a dispute involving 
a black family as "right out of 'Gorillas in the Mist,' " the movie about Dian 
Fossey's work with apes. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell's lawyer, Michael Stone, argued that the comment was irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 King testified earlier that he believes he was beaten because he is black. The 
four officers involved in the beating are white. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes also asked Powell about a computer message he sent right after the 
beating in which he said, "Oops!" and added, "I haven't beaten anyone this bad 
in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 "What does 'oops' mean to you, officer?" Grimes asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just an exclamation," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a mistake?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Powell insisted. "What I was conveying was, 'Here's a quiet night and 
look what happened.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Powell and Police Sgt. Stacey C. Koon were each sentenced to 30 months in 
prison for violating King's civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, Koon and Officers Theodore J. Briseno and Timothy E. Wind were 
acquitted of state assault charges in 1992. The verdict set off three days of 
rioting in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Punitive damages are aimed at punishing a wrongdoer and deterring such conduct 
in the future.

ROLFING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In your April 17 editorial on the false memory syndrome now infecting the 
psychotherapeutic community, you mentioned "unlicensed therapists practicing 
unconventional methods like screaming and Rolfing." This erroneous implication 
as to the nature of the Rolf technique of structural integration will deter 
readers who could benefit from this alternative approach to physical 
therapy.The purpose of Rolfing is to assist the client in organizing his body 
for greatest ease and efficiency by means of myofasical stretching and 
sensorimotor re-education. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years ago Ida P. Rolf, Ph.D., introduced these techniques that are 
now widely used by conventional physical therapists. Rolfing acquired notoriety 
in the late '60s because of the occasional intensity of the deep-tissue 
intervention and because some clients reported emotional responses associated 
with the release of structural tension. About a thousand practitioners 
worldwide are certified by the Rolf Institute of Boulder, Colo. Rolfing is not 
and has never purported to be a form of psychotherapy.

TURBULENCE IN JAPAN; OLD POWERBROKERS, OLD WAYS STYMIE A NEW PRIME MINISTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The naming of Tsutomu Hata as the new prime minister was supposed to bring 
Japan some measure of stability and keep the nation on a course toward reform. 
But less than a day after Hata was named, Japan was plunged into new political 
chaos as the largest party in his coalition government quit over policy 
disputes.With the coalition's collapse, Hata loses his majority in Parliament, 
and he has delayed selecting members of his Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is as confusing to the Japanese as to Tokyo's allies. For the 
United States, Tokyo's political paralysis will stymie progress on trade 
issues. The destabilizing events put the spotlight on conservative powerbroker 
Ichiro Ozawa. Ever since the Liberal Democratic Party lost power last year, 
Ozawa has been a major behind-the- scenes player, pulling strings here and 
there, much like the shadowy puppeteers in the bunraku show. Certainly Hata's 
transition was expected to be difficult. The coalition government that brought 
Hata's predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa to power nine months ago was fragile at 
best. Bickering among the coalition members over taxes and a North Korea policy 
delayed the naming of a new prime minister for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 What made the Socialists finally bolt was that unbeknown to them the other 
coalition members, led by Hata's Renewal Party, agreed to unite in a single 
parliamentary bloc that would exclude the Socialists. Ozawa, deputy of Hata's 
party, is said to be behind the effort to isolate the Socialists. 
</P>
<P>
 So now Tokyo lurches yet again from one political crisis to another at a time 
when the country needs decisive action on major economic and political issues. 
For all the talk of reform, Ozawa's behind-the-scenes puppeteering shows that 
so far the old powerbrokers and ways still reign in Japan's domestic politics.

ANOTHER ROSE BOWL LOSS; UCLA IS BADGERED BY WISCONSIN'S TICKET-SCALPING 
REVELATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Speaking just in public-relations terms, it's been a tough year for UCLA. 
Student hunger strikes. Faculty houses unsold on the West Side. The flap over 
Michael Milken's lecture contract. Amid all the negative news, the football 
team's Rose Bowl appearance was supposed to be an uptick. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess again. Chancellor Charles E. Young and other UCLA officials are now 
caught up in a new mess over Rose Bowl ticket scalping. The controversy grew 
out of an investigation by the Wisconsin attorney general, who is trying to 
determine if charges can be filed against travel agents who failed to deliver 
on promised Rose Bowl tickets for several hundred Wisconsin fans who traveled 
here for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of their probe, Wisconsin investigators learned that UCLA, with 
Young's approval, sold a block of 4,000 tickets to a single athletic department 
booster, Angelo Mazzone. He paid the face value of the tickets and donated an 
additional $100,000 to UCLA. In turn, Mazzone sold the tickets to a broker for 
an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
 So far there appears to be nothing illegal about the deal. Reselling tickets 
is legal in California. And school officials say they agreed to Mazzone's offer 
to avoid financial losses that UCLA would have faced if large numbers of 
tickets had been left unsold. They say they did not anticipate the ticket 
demand that resulted when Wisconsin, which had not been to the Rose Bowl in 30 
years, qualified as the visiting team. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this is another PR problem UCLA does not need. It has angered UCLA 
boosters who were told before the Rose Bowl that they could buy only a limited 
number of tickets. It revived anger in Wisconsin over hundreds of tourists who 
came out here for the game and got ripped off. And it may yet became a 
financial problem for the taxpayers who support UCLA. Last week, both the 
school and UC regents were named as defendants in a class-action lawsuit filed 
in Wisconsin on behalf of irate fans who did not get the tickets they paid for. 
Some uptick.

SALVADOR WATCH; NEW LEADER, OLD FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Armando Calderon Sol, president-elect of El Salvador, takes office amid high 
hopes and deep questions. About 10% of El Salvador's electorate was prevented 
from voting in recent national elections, but even Ruben Zamora, the losing 
candidate, does not claim that a cleaner election would have given him 
victory.The questions are rather about what Calderon will do after his 
inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
 The new president was the candidate of the extreme right-wing party, Arena, 
hand-picked for the role by the late party leader Roberto D'Aubuisson. Though 
Calderon, unlike D'Aubuisson, has not been directly implicated in war crimes 
such as the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero, he was certainly close 
enough to war criminals to make him -- far more than outgoing President Alfredo 
Cristiani -- a figure of fear on the left. 
</P>
<P>
 Those of his supporters who regard Zamora's party and its leftist coalition 
allies as "communists" might well welcome a return to D'Aubuisson's methods. 
But there is little doubt that Calderon owes his impressive 2-1 electoral 
mandate to his success in persuading the voters that he would deliver what both 
candidates promised: namely, the continued implementation of the U.N.-brokered 
peace accord that ended El Salvador's brutal civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day following his election, Calderon met with Zamora, whose followers 
hold 21 seats in the 84-seat national assembly. U.S. Ambassador Alan Flanigan 
joined them. May this conciliatory first step be followed by others in the same 
direction.

LEAD POISONING OF CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "EPA's Lead Warning Ad Called Heavy-Handed," April 20: 
</P>
<P>
 Children across the country are being introduced to lead toxins in their own 
homes and many parents are unaware of the dangers. Children with even moderate 
levels of lead poisoning may suffer from minor symptoms such as stomach pain or 
headaches.But these mild, "more subtle effects" will mask the real problems 
lead causes, such as reading disabilities and "effects on IQ." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Abraham Bergman's point is correct: Geography is not a reliable factor in 
predicting high-risk areas of lead poisoning in children. That is precisely why 
it is absolutely necessary to introduce universal lead poisoning screenings 
around the country and to also encourage parents to be aware of the many 
circumstances that can contribute to lead poisoning. The cost of the program 
may be expensive initially, but the long-term gain is a safer environment for 
our nation's children. 
</P>
<P>
 We, as citizens, can no longer ignore dangerous environmental threats due to 
the monetary costs that are attached. Lead poisoning is definitely an important 
health issue for all children and universal screenings will allow health 
officials to pinpoint highly contaminated areas around the country. EPA 
officials may not have expertise in medicine, but they do have an understanding 
of how to create a safe environment for America's young children. 
Unfortunately, they have to pick up the slack left by physicians who feel that 
lead poisoning is not an important threat to our children.

THE EYES OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE ON TEXAS; RICHARDS' POSITIVE TIES TO MEXICO 
OFFER A MODEL FOR WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson visited El Paso last Thursday to applaud tough new border 
controls that have drastically cut illegal immigration from Mexico into Texas. 
What he did not mention, and perhaps preferred to ignore, are the sophisticated 
and constructive relations Texas has built with its southern neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Those relations should embarrass the governor over the clumsy and hostile way 
in which his Administration has dealt with Mexico and Mexicans. He appears to 
be more preoccupied with putting the blame on illegal Mexican immigrants for 
some of California's woes than with looking toward a future based on mutual 
respect and trade. 
</P>
<P>
 The contrasts are marked. Gov. Ann W. Richards of Texas visits Mexico 
regularly and has a good working relationship with Mexican leaders. She is to 
meet this Friday in Ciudad Juarez, opposite El Paso, with the deputy foreign 
minister of Mexico, Andres Rozental, to discuss cross-border environmental 
problems. She maintains close ties to the four Mexican states bordering Texas 
and meets often with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. It is not just good 
politics. It is good business.  
</P>
<P>
 Richards has been working on improving transportation between Texas and 
Mexico, including a possible high-speed "bullet" train between San Antonio and 
Monterrey, capital of the neighboring state of Nuevo Leon. There are also 
discussions about building a new pipeline to sell Texas natural gas in Mexico. 
Already there is considerable cooperation between border communities, for 
example, in sending injured Mexicans back to Mexico for medical treatment, and 
in tourism promotion and educational exchanges. As a result, Texas stands to 
benefit far more than California from the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's chief cooperation with Mexican leaders appears to be in exchanging 
icy blasts over whether the Mexican constitution permits the government to 
prevent Mexicans from leaving their country. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly there are significant differences between Texas and California. 
Texas' population is only 9% foreign-born, compared with 22% in California. 
Unlike California's, Texas' border with Mexico is hundreds of miles from the 
major cities, and it is therefore somewhat easier to interdict illegal 
migrants. Also, Texas offers much-less-generous health and other public 
services. Still, both states share a Mexican heritage and have built their 
agricultural and service industries on a plentiful supply of Mexican labor. 
</P>
<P>
 We agree that illegal border crossings must be stopped. And public-opinion 
polls indicate many Californians think illegal immigration is a serious issue, 
so Wilson can legitimately claim he is responding to constituent concerns. But 
when Wilson goes to the border, he usually stays on the U.S. side and campaigns 
for votes. When Richards goes she crosses over into Mexico and invites 
constructive engagement. After Wilson called on Mexican authorities last year 
to cooperate in stanching the flow of illegal migrants, Mexico invited him to 
open a dialogue. The Mexicans say they have yet to receive a reply. Wilson's 
staff says recent efforts to set up a meeting with Salinas have been rebuffed. 
</P>
<P>
 We hope Wilson took home some lessons from Texas apart from the obvious ones 
he sought. And we hope that he spares us a reelection campaign laced with what 
may be construed as immigrant-baiting.

'BLACK AND BLUE' LYRIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re the Ralph Ellison obituary, April 17: 
</P>
<P>
 While the late author Ralph Ellison credited Fats Waller's "Black and Blue" 
lyric "with driving him to focus the painful introspection of autobiography 
that was evidenced in 'Invisible Man,' " it was Andy Razaf ("Ain't 
Misbehavin'," "Honeysuckle Rose"), the black, American-born son of a 
Madagascaran nobleman, Waller's longtime lyricist, who must be credited with 
"what did I do to be so black and blue." 
</P>
<P>
 Further "credit" should go to the gangster Dutch Schultz for inspiring Razaf, 
who inspired Ellison.The Dutchman, a business associate of my grandfather's, 
bankrolled the 1920 musical "Hot Chocolates," in which the song appeared, and 
came to Razaf with the idea to write a song about the plight of being colored. 
And that's how songs are born.

CRIME IN U.S. AND SINGAPORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It is seldom indeed that you provide such vivid and clear comparisons as are 
found on the Editorial page of April 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Side by side are two editorials; one tells of the problems in Chicago public 
housing, the other the plight of the young man in Singapore.  
</P>
<P>
 It is only through hard work that we have managed to create the situation in 
Chicago. You might say it is our system that has brought this to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 In Singapore they have managed to bring law and order to the vast body of the 
population with a minimum of loss to life or property. Their people seem to 
approve and like their system.  
</P>
<P>
 Which method seems reasonable to you?

 * While Singapore ruthlessly plans to mete out sheer torture to young Michael 
Fay as supposedly just punishment for an act best termed malicious mischief, 
the U.S. sputters and pouts and vacillates over issues such as whether to 
install increased security in public housing projects well-documented as 
cesspools of violence, drugs and thefts. It's time to first aggressively act to 
rescue Fay from this abuse and then stop whining and "clean up our own act." 
</P>
<P>
 What we share with Singapore is an inappropriate response to societal problems 
at the ends of two extremes.

 * In Singapore, an American youngster is going to have some permanent scars on 
his behind after being punished for a crime he committed. This punishment 
(caning) is very painful and can induce unconsciousness and shock. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a permanent scar across my forehead from being attacked in an unlighted 
parking lot, an attack which left me unconscious and later in shock. This 
happened in America (Los Angeles, in fact), and my attackers have never been 
caught, let alone punished. 
</P>
<P>
 I am still waiting for a sniveling editorial on my behalf, expressing outrage 
and indignation at such brutal treatment. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * It's difficult to contain one's anger when reading about former New York 
Mayor Ed Koch's notion that we should introduce some sanitized version of 
caning into our penal system (Commentary, April 20). At the very least, I 
thought politicians, like comedians, were noted for their timing. 
</P>
<P>
 His craven appeal to the public's rightful concern about crime and safety 
should not take precedence over the fundamental issues here. Firstly, a young 
American is about to be brutally flogged (or flayed), and his last remaining 
hope is for clemency from the president of Singapore. Koch's article gives 
Singapore further reason and excuse to ignore pleas for humane treatment of 
Fay. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, where is Koch's support for due process and fair trial? Fay quite 
likely had his "confession" beaten and intimidated out of him, but even if 
remotely guilty, no one, neither American nor Singaporean, deserves this form 
of vicious and sadistic punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 If our government and leading politicians are willing to place sanctions on 
the likes of Taiwan for endangering the white tiger, and South Africa for 
apartheid, I hope we are prepared to repay Singapore, that modern-day Carthage,

 * I am a 16-year-old student and a former student ambassador to Singapore. I 
am aghast at the volume of letters and articles I have read that support the 
inhumane caning of 18-year-old Fay. Many Americans seem to think that the 
introduction of caning into this country would magically erase criminal and 
gang-related activity. They are wrong. Singapore is so wonderfully clean and 
safe due to its multitude of repressive laws that successfully smother free 
speech and any opposition to the government. If that is what some Americans are 
looking for, they'd better move to Singapore. Despite the overwhelming contrast 
of seemingly trouble-free Singapore and the many serious problems that exist in 
the United States, I would rather live in a country where freedom of speech and 
political views takes precedence over fantasies of a utopia that will never 
exist.

 The Times did a great service to California voters by introducing us to 
Michael Huffington, who apparently got the word while praying on Mt. Athos that 
he should seek the real meaning in life by purchasing a seat in the U.S. Senate 
(April 17). 
</P>
<P>
 The professional politicians who know us so well that we despise them may not 
be the answer for these mixed-up times. But surely we aren't so desperate that 
we'll elect these seekers of spirit worlds who come down to Earth only long 
enough to sign checks on their fathers' bank accounts to pay very earthy 
political consultants for TV ads.

 Do we really have to suffer through the campaign commercials of another 
ultra-rich conservative trying to buy a Senate seat because he's failed at all 
the other jobs that daddy's money could buy? Give us a break, Mr. Huffington. 
Besides, there are plenty of us who agree with Sen. Dianne Feinstein's 
"deciding" vote on Clinton's plan to raise taxes on the wealthy.

STOP 'PILLORYING HILLARY'; IT'S UTTER HYPOCRISY; WHITEWATER: SHAME ON THE 
REPORTERS WHO, WITH WATERGATE STARS IN THEIR EYES, WENT AFTER HER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY FRIEDAN, Betty Friedan's latest book is The Fountain of Age (Simon and 
Schuster, 1994). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'd been invited to Australia to help launch a new government policy on age 
and to talk about my book, "The Fountain of Age." But since I am also known as 
an American feminist, I was asked by women in Sydney and Melbourne, "What on 
earth are they doing to Hillary in your country?" 
</P>
<P>
 I was myself unable to figure out why it had suddenly become a crime for an 
American to have made $100,000 on the commodities market 17 years ago -- this 
is a capitalist nation, after all -- though some men may still resent that a 
woman acting on a smart tip could turn $1,000 into $100,000 in that high-risk 
market. It's not exactly like turning $1 million into $100 million in the S&L 
scandal at the taxpayers' expense. As for Whitewater, it seems to have been a 
financial mistake that didn't make anybody money. 
</P>
<P>
 I first knew of Hillary Rodham Clinton when she headed the board of the 
Children's Defense Fund, working as an effective and unremitting advocate of 
neglected children, black and white, in the era of greed. President Clinton, by 
putting her in charge of health-care reform, and she, by her leadership, have 
lent national health insurance a seriousness and a sense of urgency.  
</P>
<P>
 So all I could surmise was that the powerful economic and political forces in 
this country who want to prevent health insurance from happening and who want 
to bring Bill Clinton down were trying to do so by getting Hillary. This seemed 
a little crazy to the women of Australia, since they've long had national 
health insurance. But I assured them that this "get Hillary" ploy wouldn't 
work, that the American people support Hillary Rodham Clinton as an equal 
partner of the President. 
</P>
<P>
 When I got back home and saw escalating scandal insinuations about Hillary and 
"Whitewatergate" on the front pages and covers of newspapers and magazines, my 
incredulity turned to outrage. What hypocrisy, all this digging up of tax 
mistakes of several thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been pointed out to me defensively by some journalists that certain 
newspapers that caught on to Watergate late are trying to make up for it by 
"building Whitewatergate," as they put it, into a news scoop. It has also been 
explained to me that women journalists "have to prove that they are not 
feminists by getting Hillary as meanly as the men." 
</P>
<P>
 I am proud of my young sisters in the National Organization for Women and the 
Hollywood Women's Political Committee and the Democratic National Committee for 
their marches, ads and buttons, "Stop Pillorying Hillary." And I am ashamed of 
the editors and reporters who are exacerbating and building up beyond all 
probable basis in fact "Whitewatergate" and, yes, lending themselves to 
"pillorying Hillary." 
</P>
<P>
 Some insight into the media's role here may be found in a report just released 
by Women, Men & Media, which I co-chair and direct under the auspices of the 
schools of journalism of USC and New York University and the Freedom Forum, 
analyzing the coverage of women on the front pages. While there has been a 
notable increase in the percentage of women mentioned, quoted or pictured on 
the front pages of major newspapers, it seems that women are mainly there as 
victims or perpetrators of violence (Bobbitt and Harding), as sex objects or in 
otherwise negative roles or as "entertainers," while men hit the front pages 
predominantly as opinion makers. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing number of women in Congress, the Cabinet, Supreme Court and 
business leadership are evidently still notoriously not quoted on the front 
pages or in broadcast news. Did Hillary Rodham Clinton violate that taboo 
through her impossible-to-ignore force as an opinion maker? She used that force 
effectively last week to defend the investments she made for her family's 
welfare, but she shouldn't have had to. Where is the investigative reporting 
about the role of the insurance, pharmaceutical or medical establishments or 
the Republican National Committee in "Whitewatergate"? 
</P>
<P>
 I am outraged at the hypocrisy and double standard and, yes, immorality of the 
misuse of government and media power diverting our attention and resources from 
the real problems facing our nation -- the job-downsizing crisis, the 
health-care crisis, escalating gun violence, Bosnia -- to which the President 
and his wife, the Administration and Congress need to give their whole 
attention. As for the media, have you no shame?

DON'T ASK GORAZDE TO SURRENDER; BOSNIA: THE SERBS DON'T WANT ONLY THE 
TERRITORY; THEY WANT IT 'CLEANSED.' REALPOLITIK WOULD OFFER PEACE WITHOUT 
SECURITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MILES, Jack Miles is a member of The Times' editorial board. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rape of the Bosnian "safe haven" town of Gorazde has come as grim 
vindication for those who have urged the view that the Bosnian Serbs have won, 
the Bosnian Muslims have lost and further resistance is futile. Columnist Jim 
Hoagland spoke for many, particularly in the diplomatic community, when he 
argued last week "for Clinton's joining the Europeans in a Realpolitik solution 
of accepting the Serb victory in Bosnia and shutting this war down now. That in 
turn means dropping the smoke-screen talk of lifting the arms embargo while 
negotiating the best surrender terms possible for the vanquished Bosnian 
Muslims." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoagland deserves credit for using the word surrender. Too few have. But can 
official Bosnia-Herzegovina -- heavily but by no means entirely Muslim -- 
afford to surrender? The question may seem a strange one. What choice do the 
defeated have but surrender? Are they to fight until the last man, woman and 
child is dead or captured? Surely, surrender is preferable to that. This is 
where Realpolitik and idealism conflict most sharply. Fighting to the last man 
is false idealism, the stuff of mythology, not of modern warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 But consider the position in which Bosnia actually finds itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The central feature of any imaginable surrender agreement will be territorial 
partition along ethnic/religious lines. But will the Serbs accept their 
victory? The terms most recently proposed by the European Union's David Owen 
and the United Nations' Thorwald Stoltenberg are sure to be revised in the 
Serbs' favor, given their military strength and the mood of defeat in the 
European Union and the United Nations. But even then, will the Serbs be 
satisfied? There is every reason to doubt this. The Bosnians must be prepared 
for them, instead, to disregard the terms of a surrender agreement just as they 
have disregarded the terms of so many cease-fires. Post-surrender, whatever 
remains of the Bosnian state will almost certainly come under immediate Serbian 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 But what of enforcement of the agreement by the United Nations or NATO? After 
Gorazde, can such a question even be asked? The declaration of safety for the 
haven cities -- a dry run for the enforcement of a surrender agreement -- was a 
modest promise that the United Nations has failed to keep. The Serbs have 
repeatedly manipulated the United Nations into providing cover for their 
aggression, a point made with bitterness and shame by the U.N. commander in 
Bosnia, Sir Michael Rose. NATO, in the moment of truth, has twice run from the 
fight, and many hundreds have died as a result. If the surrender terms are to 
be enforced only by these bodies, the Bosnians must expect the terms simply to 
be unenforced. 
</P>
<P>
 But why not, even then, surrender and hope for the best rather than fight on 
to certain defeat? Because the Serbs' declared and already substantially 
implemented political program is genocidal. Documentation on this point is 
abundant. Post-surrender, the Bosnians must plan not on the excesses of 
soldiers in the heat of battle but on a cold and considered policy aimed at 
what former Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, formally investigating 
the matter for the United Nations, did not shrink from calling "extermination." 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's election slogan was "Mobilization and 
Homogenization." Redrawing the Serb/Bosnian border in Bosnia is thus not like 
redrawing the French/German border in Alsace-Lorraine. The French and the 
Germans fought to control land and people. The Serbs want the land without the 
people. In the name of homogeneity, they have expelled those they could expel 
and slain the rest. As the last local refugee havens fall and no foreign havens 
open, slaughter will necessarily become the tactic of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with this choice between, analogously, Auschwitz and an endless Warsaw 
Uprising, Realpolitik recommends Auschwitz. No one should be surprised, 
however, if the Bosnians themselves choose the Warsaw Uprising even knowing 
that eventual annihilation awaits them. In their position, what would you do? 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Hoagland, whose integrity is beyond reproach, does not intend to urge 
extermination as a peace settlement for the Bosnians. That much should go 
without saying. But just as the methodological exclusion of morality and morale 
from the political calculus led the United States astray in Vietnam, so it 
could do so again in the Balkans. A people with nothing left to lose but life 
itself should be expected to fight on, and it is wishful thinking to suppose 
otherwise, to suppose, in other words, that merely declaring them defeated will 
"shut this war down." 
</P>
<P>
 Wars are not won by air power alone. But neither are they won by ground and 
air power together. They are won or lost by human beings in all their 
complexity, and the besetting temptation of Realpolitik is to leave out some of 
that complexity -- above all the complexity of desperate emotion. Ismet Briga, 
Gorazde's mayor, said at the peak of the siege: "We have only two choices: We 
can be slaughtered, or we can fight and die with dignity. The town will not 
fall as long as there is anybody alive in it." In some wars, in some sieges, a 
statement like his might be dismissed as bravado. In this one, it should not 
be. It has just the kind of psychological realism about it to which classic 
Realpolitik has so often been blind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surrender and be done with it" is not the voice of reason. The Bosnians, 
whatever their losses, dare not surrender, and we shall none of us soon be done 
with it.

SCOTT HARRIS: GETTING A BETTER READ ON MISS OCTOBER; AS MS. MCCARTHY READ ON .

<P>
 National Library Week is, of course, one of the most exhilarating occasions of 
any year. This one promised to be extra-special, because Gayle Wilson, the 
First Lady of California, was to give a reading at the Canoga Park Branch of 
the Los Angeles Public Library. I planned to show up early to get a good seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, her appearance conflicted with a prior commitment. My next 
thought was to visit the Studio City Branch, where Charlton Heston was to read 
from the works of A. A. Milne. 
</P>
<P>
 But then I heard the ghost of Ward Cleaver. This might frighten some people, 
but whenever I'm in a crisis, I ask myself: "What would Ward Cleaver do?" I 
mean, has there ever been a soul as wise and responsible as the Beav's dad? 
Anyway, Ward said: "Scott, National Library Week isn't about personalities and 
celebrities! It's about books and reading! Just pick any convenient library!" 
</P>
<P>
 And so it was that I ended up at the Panorama City library last Wednesday 
evening, where a young woman named Jennifer McCarthy gave a dramatic reading of 
"Green Eggs and Ham" and other works for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. McCarthy is a model, an actress and Playboy magazine's Miss October 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am Sam . . . " she began, sitting in a small huddle of rapt children. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugh Hefner would have been proud. For 41 years now, he has promoted the 
affectation that the young women featured in the centerfold of his magazines 
are "the girls next door." 
</P>
<P>
 Men typically have one of two reactions to this notion. The most common is: 
"Yeah, right." The more gullible wonder how they might move into Hef's 
neighborhood, which is not so much a matter of geography as it is a matter of 
money, materialism and something Hef dubbed the Playboy Philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Ms. McCarthy read on -- "I do not like that Sam-I-am!" -- it wasn't so 
hard to think of her as . . . well, maybe not the girl next door, but a nice 
young woman who likes kids and is liked in return. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids weren't her only audience. There were some moms, dads, librarians and 
a surprising number of journalists. (Maybe they had scheduling conflicts, too.) 
It seemed curious that no female reporters were present, given the strides that 
women have made in the newsroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless you have a copy of last October's Playboy, you are probably wondering 
about Ms. McCarthy's appearance. Ordinarily, it strikes me as sexist to comment 
on something as superficial as a woman's looks, unless these facts are 
relevant, which is the case with any Playmate. A Playboy press release 
describes her as "a vivacious beauty" with blond hair and blue eyes. Her 
Playmate Data Sheet gives her height as 5 feet, 7 inches and other dimensions 
as 38-24-34. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would you eat them in the house?" she read. "Would you eat them with a 
mouse?" 
</P>
<P>
 She was rolling. Miss October, it was obvious, could read "Green Eggs and Ham" 
with the best. The kids liked her. The dads liked her. The reporters liked her. 
And so did the librarians. 
</P>
<P>
 "She used to work in a preschool," whispered the supervising librarian, Thea 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it funny that a Ms. March would find herself working with a Miss 
October? Funnier still is the way people reacted to news of the Playmate's 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 The male reaction, Ms. March said, was one of approval. A few males, in fact, 
"were practically salivating -- like my sons." 
</P>
<P>
 The female reaction, the librarian said, was generally sarcastic. "The women 
said, 'Oh? She can read???' . . . But she's really quite charming." 
</P>
<P>
 Such is a price of being a Playmate. And it isn't just women who take cheap 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, when I covered Hugh Hefner's wedding to a former Playmate of 
the Year, my editor, a man, suggested this start: "The bride wore clothes." And 
just now, another colleague, also male, asked me whether Miss October gave a 
reading of the tactile children's classic, "Pat the Bunny." 
</P>
<P>
 People can be so cruel. 
</P>
<P>
 As Miss October entertained the children, I followed Ms. March into the 
office, where she happened to have a copy of last October's Playboy, which the 
Panorama City staff had borrowed from another branch. They were as curious 
about Ms. McCarthy as anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 It was my journalistic duty to peruse Miss October's photo spread. Even the 
librarian couldn't resist a catty comment. "Well," Ms. March observed, "she's 
not a natural blonde." 
</P>
<P>
 More important, I was able to learn that Jenny McCarthy is a native of Chicago 
who grew up in a close-knit Irish Catholic family. At Mother McAuley High 
School she was a cheerleader and a member of the field hockey team. She was 
studying nursing when financial problems "forced her to put her career on 
hold." Friends urged her to try modeling. Soon she was in Playboy. 
</P>
<P>
 From the press release I learned of her strong family values, her zest for 
life and her can-do spirit. From her Playmate Data Sheet I discovered that her 
"Turn Ons" include "guys on Harleys, daredevils, men who aren't afraid to cry 
or show their emotions." And among her ambitions is to someday have a "Beaver 
Cleaver" kind of family. 
</P>
<P>
 So she's a Ward Cleaver fan too!  
</P>
<P>
 Only in America could a young nursing student with financial troubles wind up 
becoming the prime candidate for Playmate of the Year. All that glamour and 
glitz -- yet she holds on to the dream of being the mom next door. 
</P>
<P>
 I got all choked up just thinking about it. In fact, I wept. It made me think 
that maybe my neighborhood and Hef's aren't so far apart after all. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all I could think about as I headed home on my Harley. 
</P>
<P>

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; BIKE PATROL TAKES TO

 They are an army of neon-helmeted, Lycra-laden warriors on knobby wheels, 
these parkland patrollers. 
</P>
<P>
 On any given day you can see them in the Santa Monica Mountains, in teams of 
at least two, on lookout from their rolling ranger stations. Fueled by 
mouthfuls of chewy, grainy Power Bars and gulps of water and fresh air, these 
mountain bikers traverse the trails of the national recreation area, keeping 
watch for hikers, bikers or equestrians who need directions or medical help. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mountain Bike Unit, organized by the National Park Service, the Cali- 
fornia Department of Parks and Recreation and the Concerned Off Road Bicyclists 
Assn., patrols the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreational Area keeping an 
eye on the parks and their users. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really hard to miss," said Ross Blasman, an MBU founder, who described 
the bright yellow cycling jerseys emblazoned with "MBU" that members wear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our job is to be an extension of the paid park staff," he said. "We have the 
same goals that they have, which are to preserve resources while providing 
recreational opportunities to the visiting public." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the group's beginning 5 1/2 years ago, Mountain Bike Unit members have 
volunteered more than 30,000 hours, Blasman said. The unit now has more than 80 
active members and can accommodate up to 125. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're our second pair of eyes out in the park helping us patrol," said Jean 
Bray, a spokeswoman for the recreation area, which is part of the national 
parks system. "They're out there to assist people if they need help. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trained in CPR. They're trained in the National Park Service 
mission," Bray said. "They're trained in the courteous use of bicycles in a 
recreation area and will train other bicycles on the path." 
</P>
<P>
 The next training session for new members is set for May 7 at Malibu Creek 
State Park. The orientation meeting, where riders meet each other, learn about 
the program and take an introductory spin, begins at 9 a.m. and concludes at 2 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people are phenomenal. The orientation ride, the May 7 date, is like my 
favorite day of the year," said Blasman, 43, of Newbury Park. "We've got 
students, we've got peace officers, we've got professionals. And they all have 
one thing in common -- they love the mountains and they want to give something 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers are trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, basic first aid, 
National Park Service philosophy and how to deal with backcountry situations in 
32 hours over six Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 When certified, each volunteer will be asked to patrol a minimum of eight 
hours per month. Patrol areas include Malibu Creek State Park, Point Mugu, 
Topanga and other national and state parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Riders choose the date, time, area and partner for their patrols. They also 
choose the speed. The MBU isn't looking for hotshots or hammerheads. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to be good. You have to be smart. We've had people take their 
very first mountain bike ride on the orientation ride," Blasman said. "We're 
looking for people who use their heads, know their limits and have a good 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
 For more information call the National Park Service VIP Coordinator Sheila 
Hoffos at (818) 597-1036, Blasman at (805) 378-5100 or Joe Dillman, scheduling 
coordinator of the MBU at (818) 706-2789. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers don't have to call to register for the orientation. They can just 
show up, Blasman said. Riders should bring cycling helmets, food and water. 
</P>
<P>
 Other volunteering opportunities: 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers are needed to help prepare and serve at the Fred Jordan Mission's 
annual Mother's Day luncheon on May 8. The mission is located in Downtown Los

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; NIXON'S FINAL TRIP HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former President Richard Nixon, born poor in Yorba Linda and hewed in the 
conservative politics of his day, makes a final homecoming today to Orange 
County. His body is scheduled to arrive at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
before lying in state at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace in Yorba Linda, 
with the funeral Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon and the county of his birth had a long association that brought world 
attention to San Clemente during the White House years and thereafter, and 
renewed interest with the opening of the library and more recent announcement 
of plans for a think tank. When you consider the length of his life, Nixon did 
not spend a great deal of his time in Orange County, but there was an important 
relationship renewed at key turns. It was the place that met Robert Frost's 
test of home after Nixon resigned the presidency: the place where, when you 
have to go there, they have to take you in. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's place of origin, his sanctuary and now his final resting place was -- 
over his years on the world stage -- in the end as transformed as he was. It 
became a place of suburban tracts and office complexes, of people and firms 
thinking and acting globally. 
</P>
<P>
 In his final book, Nixon said that "the art of national unity" must be 
practiced in the United States; today that it is as much a challenge for the 
once-homogenous county, now a place of many nationalities, as for any place on 
the American landscape. The man and point of origin had by a life's end evolved 
beyond the limited perspectives of earlier decades. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, by the conclusion of Nixon's life, both he and Orange County defied 
the easy political stereotypes and categorization. Each had been changed from a 
striking national symbol of arch-conservatism into something more complex, if 
not quite yet completely defined.

ANGELS HOLD ON TO FIRST; BASEBALL: THE YANKEES HAND THEM THEIR FOURTH LOSS IN A 
ROW, 11-1, BUT THEY STAY TIED AT THE TOP IN THE AL WEST AT 8-12. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was never open animosity between the two outfielders, but even though 
they were teammates, they considered each other rivals who desperately wanted 
to outperform the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it should have come as no surprise Monday night in what began as a 
baseball game -- with the New York Yankees winning by 11-1 over the Angels -- 
quickly turned into a personal duel between outfielders Luis Polonia and Chad 
Curtis at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Polonia, confident the Angels will miss him more than they will ever imagine, 
used Monday's performance to showcase his argument. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to show those guys they never should have let me go," said Polonia, 
who went two for five with a double and scored a run. "I want the fans to keep 
saying, 'Why did they let him go? Why?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I want everyone to know what I meant to the Angels." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, losing their fourth consecutive game, hardly are willing to 
acknowledge they miss Polonia, but it's no secret they don't have an 
established leadoff hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing they have proved is that they are extremely fortunate to be 
playing in the worst division in baseball. At 8-12, they are in a first-place 
tie in the American League West, owning the worst record of any first-place 
team in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
 "My God, what a division," Polonia said. "How do you get to be in a division 
like that? Over here, we might have to win 100 games to win our division. 
</P>
<P>
 "In their division, you can lose 100 games and still win it." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Angels are on a pace to finish with a 64-98 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something to laugh about," said Angel starter Mark Leiter (2-1), who 
yielded eight hits and seven runs in five innings. Leiter gave up a grand slam 
to Matt Nokes, and three of Paul O'Neill's five hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's way too early to think a team will be under .500 in our division and 
still win it," Leiter said. "We just don't want to get used to the idea that 
we're in first place and everything's great." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel Manager Buck Rodgers: "This division, I don't think, is as bad as 
it's showing. I don't think it's the strongest division -- I'm not that nuts -- 
but it will catch up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you what, I sure feel better about our club now than at any point I 
ever did last year." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Yankees are 13-6, and still in second place in the American League 
East, Polonia predicts the Yankees will win their division. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasoning, he says simply, is because of him. He has given the Yankees a 
bona fide leadoff hitter. The Angels continue to search for one, using four 
batters in the spot this season. They have batted a cumulative .247 with 10 
runs, three stolen bases and eight RBIs. Polonia is batting .269 with eight 
runs, five stolen bases and six RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought (Curtis) could probably do it," Polonia said, "but I guess not. 
He's got to have somebody (to compete with) . . . He wanted to beat me in 
everything. That's where he got his motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where that motivation is now. He's got his three-year contract, 
and he's comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis, who is batting .200 with seven runs and five RBIs, already has been 
dropped from the leadoff spot. But Curtis insists his three-year, $4.5-million 
contract has not changed him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be lying if I said my three-year contract didn't make me more 
comfortable," Curtis said, "but it won't make me complacent. I definitely have 
higher standards than that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have to live with what other people think of me, but I have to live 
with myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis provided all of the evidence needed Monday when he dared Polonia to run 
on him in the sixth inning. Polonia, who was standing on second, gestured to 
Curtis in center field. Curtis nodded back, motioning not to run on his arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Don Mattingly singled to center. Pat Kelly scored easily from 
third. Third-base coach Willie Randolph gave Polonia the stop sign, but Polonia 
ran right through it. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis' throw was perfect. Catcher Chris Turner was waiting with the ball when 
Polonia crashed into him, and held onto it for the out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him that he better not run on me, or I'd throw him out," Curtis said. 
"So it didn't surprise me. I expected it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we had a little thing going the last couple of years, but really, I'm 
not here to replace Luis Polonia. I'm here to be Chad Curtis."

 Oklahoma ended its two-week search for a basketball coach Monday by hiring 
Kelvin Sampson of Washington State to replace Billy Tubbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampson, 38, and his wife, Karen, impressed Athletic Director Donnie Duncan 
and others on the search committee during an interview Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They walked out and the only question they had was, 'Can we get this guy?' 
because of his feelings for Washington State," Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampson, 38, departs a program that he turned around during his seven years. 
The Cougars had losing seasons in his first three seasons, but none after that. 
They reached the NIT in 1992, and last season finished 20-11 and went to the 
NCAA tournament for the first time since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampson will receive an annual salary of $115,000. The deal also includes a 
shoe contract, summer camps and radio and television shows that could increase 
that figure significantly.

Monday night at his Lexington home and will hold a news conference today, but

 NBA officials are investigating the reasons why the retired Calvin Murphy was 
holding the ball right before Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf shot a free throw Sunday that 
could have broken Murphy's single-season percentage record. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul-Rauf shot his only two free throws in the third quarter of Denver's 
regular-season finale against the Houston Rockets. He made the first but missed 
the second, blowing a chance to break Murphy's record set in 1980-81. 
</P>
<P>
 During a timeout before the shots, Murphy stood up from his courtside seat, 
got the ball from a referee, rubbed it, then handed it back to the official.

 The Boston Bruins have fired 102 shots at goaltender Patrick Roy of the 
Montreal Canadiens in their last two playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
 They have three goals and two losses to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy, hospitalized because of appendicitis until Saturday, stopped 60 shots and 
Kirk Muller scored with 17:18 gone in overtime as the Canadiens defeated the 
Bruins, 2-1, on Monday night at Boston to take a 3-2 lead in their Eastern 
Conference quarterfinal series. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday in Game 4, Roy came out of the hospital to stop 39 shots and 
defeat the Bruins, 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we need 80 or 90 shots to get that other goal," Boston defenseman 
Glen Wesley said. "We outplayed them again. We carried the play in their end. 
What else can we say?" 
</P>
<P>
 Roy made three fabulous saves just before Muller's winner, stopping the Bruins 
on a sustained flurry in front of the Montreal net. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had quality chances, but we had Patrick," Montreal Coach Jacques Demers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Muller backhanded a rebound of a Patrice Brisebois shot over Bruin goalie Jon 
Casey for the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 3, Washington 2 -- Playing before 15,044 at Pittsburgh, their 
smallest home crowd of the season, the Penguins rallied from a 2-1 
second-period deficit to stave off playoff elimination.  
</P>
<P>
 Jaromir Jagr and Kevin Stevens scored their first playoff goals to reignite 
Pittsburgh's offense and help the Penguins avoid what would be their second 
consecutive early round ouster. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, which again used rookie goaltender Byron Dafoe instead of Don 
Beaupre, leads the Eastern Conference quarterfinal series, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 5, Buffalo 3 -- Claude Lemieux had two goals and two assists at 
East Rutherford, N.J., to help the Devils take a 3-2 lead in the Eastern 
Conference quarterfinal series. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemieux set up two goals by John MacLean as the Devils rallied from a two-goal 
second-period deficit. Martin Brodeur made 17 saves for the Devils.

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; DETROIT MIGHT MISS ULTIMATE GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the theory that you get what you pay for, Detroit Red Wing owner Mike 
Ilitch spent nearly $1 million of his pizza company dough to hire Scotty 
Bowman, a seven-time Stanley Cup winner as coach in Montreal and Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 But given a chance to acquire Cup-winning goalies Bill Ranford and Grant Fuhr, 
Detroit General Manager Bryan Murray settled for Winnipeg's Bob Essensa, whose 
puck-stopping ability is dubious.  
</P>
<P>
 Murray says he doesn't regret his decision, even though Essensa gave up five 
goals to the San Jose Sharks in a playoff-opening loss. Rookie Chris Osgood has 
both Detroit victories in the series, which resumes tonight at San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked seriously to about three other teams, but the price was something I 
didn't feel we could afford as an organization," Murray said. "We could have 
gotten Fuhr for Chris Osgood and Keith Primeau, and Ranford for those two and 
more. I wasn't prepared to do that, to give up a 20-year-old goalie for a 
32-year-old (Fuhr). We have a lot of young players who are going to get better, 
and we didn't want to sacrifice them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Wings haven't won the Cup since 1955 and haven't gotten past the 
second round of the playoffs since 1988. What if they lose because of Murray's 
inaction? "It's not a problem at all," he said. "That was addressed at the 
organizational level. Osgood's a real good goaltender. He's calm and cool. You 
give him up and you're playing against him for the next 10, 12 years." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sharks lost to Osgood three times before defeating him Saturday with a 
third-period rally. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were overconfident, I think," said Arturs Irbe, Shark goalie. "They were 
thinking they're supposed to beat the Sharks. Everybody says so. They were so 
confident, maybe that confidence turned against them." 
</P>
<P>
 And perhaps they're frustrated: Sergei Fedorov, Ray Sheppard and Viacheslav 
Kozlov, who combined for 142 goals this season, have none. Is Bowman concerned? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something to look forward to," Bowman said, sarcastically. LUNCH TIME 
</P>
<P>
 With a little pepper, crow doesn't taste so bad. It's on the menu here for 
having underestimated the Rangers' superiority over the Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Any thought that emotion might lift the Islanders to the Rangers' level 
vanished in the first two games, 6-0 Ranger victories. The Rangers were 
disciplined and dominant throughout the series. Mike Richter didn't give up a 
goal for the first 135 minutes 28 seconds and stopped 87 of 90 shots. In 
getting their first best-of-seven sweep since 1972, the Rangers gave up one 
power-play goal in 17 chances and outscored their rivals, 22-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Not too shabby. BLUE NOTES 
</P>
<P>
 Few NHL executives shed tears over the St. Louis Blues' swift playoff exit. 
</P>
<P>
 None wanted to see St. Louis succeed after club President Jack Quinn tried to 
buy the Cup by signing free agent Petr Nedved to a three-year, $4-million 
contract and Peter Stastny, 37, to a $1.2-million deal. Whether jealous of 
Quinn's cash reserves or afraid they would have to respond with similar deals, 
most general managers rooted for the Dallas Stars. 
</P>
<P>
 They got their wish. Stastny was ineffective, Nedved added nothing to his thin 
playoff resume and defenseman Steve Duchesne provided none of the spark the 
Blues sought when they acquired him from Quebec. He was derided by Coach Bob 
Berry, who is on shaky ground for his failure to tame the Blues' disparate 
personalities. THE BIG HURT 
</P>
<P>
 The appendicitis that hospitalized Montreal goalie Patrick Roy last Thursday 
hurt the Canadiens too. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy's value was never more obvious than in their 6-3 loss to the Bruins in 
Game 3 with Ron Tugnutt in goal. The Canadiens played badly, but Tugnutt fell 
to their level instead of rising to the occasion. His glove hand was slow, and 
he worked poorly with his defense. "I felt for him," Bruin goalie Vincent 
Riendeau said. "He probably had the toughest job in Quebec (Thursday) -- 
tougher than the prime minister's job, because Patrick Roy is a god here." 
AROUND THE WORLD 
</P>
<P>
 The World Championships, which began Monday in Italy, feature more talent than 
the Olympics. Instead of college stars and minor leaguers, NHL players fill the 
rosters of Team USA and Canada and supplement Sweden's squad. Sweden and 
Canada, the gold and silver medalists at Lillehammer, are favored. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun. It's the Stanley Cup of Europe," said Team USA Coach Ron Wilson, 
coach of the Mighty Ducks. "I've got a lot of friends just across the border in 
Switzerland (where he played for six seasons), so it's special to me to go over 
there after the success we've had. They think it's really a big deal to be 
coaching the U.S. national team, and it is. To be in the same position as Bob 
Johnson and Herb Brooks is just great." 
</P>
<P>
 Team USA was hurt by refusals from Winnipeg's Keith Tkachuk, King goalie Robb 
Stauber and Florida goalie John Vanbiesbrouck, but will gain players from teams 
whose playoffs end early. Canada has Ranford in goal, a defense that includes 
the Kings' Rob Blake and Darryl Sydor, Tampa Bay's Marc Bergevin and Edmonton's 
Luke Richardson and ample scoring potential in the Flyers' Rod Brind'Amour (35 
goals, 97 points), the Jets' Nelson Emerson (33 goals), the Kings' Luc 
Robitaille (44 goals) and Hartford's Geoff Sanderson and Pat Verbeek, who had 
41 and 37 goals, respectively. Olympian Paul Kariya is another threat. SLAP 
SHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 Before Sunday, Norris Trophy winner Brian Leetch had won only one playoff 
series in seven seasons with the Rangers. Either they missed the postseason 
party, he did (broken ankle), or they lost early. . . . A few months ago, the 
Capitals couldn't give Don Beaupre away. They went back to him when Rick 
Tabaracci faltered and have watched him handle the Penguins in Games 1, 3 and 
4. He got help from a defense that permits almost no rebounds. . . . Steve 
Yzerman, who sat out Detroit's first four playoff games because of a mysterious 
injury -- best guess was a sprained right knee -- is expected to return 
tonight. . . . Despite losing centers Joel Otto and Joe Nieuwendyk to knee 
injuries, the Flames have pushed the Canucks to the brink of elimination. 
Vancouver right wing Pavel Bure, a 60-goal scorer, has been silenced by the 
checking of Mike Sullivan.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; MARLINS WIN, BUT HARVEY IS INJURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With closer Bryan Harvey injured, the Florida Marlins barely held off the 
Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey suffered an elbow injury Monday night and left the game in the ninth 
inning of the Marlins' 4-3 victory over the Braves at Miami. It was the Braves' 
first loss in 11 road games this year. 
</P>
<P>
 X-rays of Harvey's elbow were negative. He will undergo more tests today to 
determine the extent of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not worried yet," Harvey said. "I don't know what it is. If it's just 
tendinitis, it's nothing to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey, then with the Angels, had surgery on the same elbow in 1988 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey started the ninth and gave up a walk and single. He threw a 95-m.p.h. 
fastball for strike one to Javier Lopez, felt a burning sensation in his arm, 
visited with a trainer and left the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Hernandez replaced Harvey and gave up a two-run double to Lopez before 
retiring three consecutive batters for his first save of the season. First 
baseman Jeff Conine made a diving catch of Deion Sanders' liner to end the game 
with pinch-runner Mike Kelly at second. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta's two runs in the ninth were charged to Harvey, the first he has given 
up all year, spring training included. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Weathers (3-1) pitched 7 1/3 innings and Gary Sheffield hit a two-run 
homer for the Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 7, St. Louis 6 -- The Rockies hit three home runs at Busch Stadium, 
showing the Cardinals that they have plenty of power away from Mile High 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Andres Galarraga and Ellis Burks each hit their eighth homers in the fifth 
inning against Tom Urbani (0-2) as Colorado took a 7-6 lead. Galarraga's 
three-run shot tied the score and Burks put the Rockies ahead with his third 
consecutive hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Johnson hit his first homer in the first inning for the Rockies, who 
have hit eight home runs in three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 7, Pittsburgh 3 -- Andy Stankiewicz hit a three-run homer and Craig 
Biggio hit a two-run shot for the Astros at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Harnisch (1-2) gave up six hits in his first complete game of the season. 
He struck out eight and walked three. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 4, Chicago 3 -- Roberto Kelly's two-out single in the 10th inning 
gave the Reds the victory at Cincinnati after Tony Fernandez hit a two-run 
homer on reliever Randy Myers' first pitch in the ninth to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez's hit was the first given up by Myers (0-1) this season. It was 
Myers' first blown save in 21 opportunities.

BOXING; SHARP BORBOA CUTS DOWN ROMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Firing punches from all angles in a flurry of quick combinations, Julio Cesar 
Borboa showcased himself as a rising star Monday night at the Forum to defend 
his International Boxing Federation super-flyweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
 After a slow start, Borboa, 24, dominated challenger Jorge Luis Roman from the 
second round on, opened a cut at the end of the second and a deeper gash in the 
fourth, and won when Dr. Robert Karns advised referee James Jen-Kin to stop the 
fight at 2:30 of the fourth before a crowd of 4,328. 
</P>
<P>
 Borboa, of Sonora, Mexico, crunched a left hook into the body followed by a 
right to the head that sent Roman to the canvas for a knockdown just before 
Jen-Kin and Karns decided to stop the fight with blood pouring out of the new 
cut over Roman's left eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of was hoping that he wouldn't get cut because I wanted him to really 
bring out the best in me," said Borboa (22-4, 20 knockouts). I was hoping to 
really show the people here that I'm a good fighter. But I'm happy." 
</P>
<P>
 The first cut, over the right eye of Roman (17-10), was caused by a Borboa 
head butt, but the decisive cut was produced by a series of Borboa 
combinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Borboa opened up in the third round, landing heavy hooks to the head and body 
as Roman's face got messier. Borboa closed the round with a picture-perfect 
right-to-the-body, left-hook-to-the-head combination. 
</P>
<P>
 Roman, coming off an upset of highly regarded Scotty Olson, made a rally early 
in the third, trapping Borboa against the ropes with a couple of right 
uppercuts. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the end of the round, Borboa was back in control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the ref did the right thing by stopping it," Borboa said. "The cut 
was bad, and it would have only gotten worse if I kept going." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 10-round co-feature, Carlos (Famous) Hernandez breezed past veteran 
junior-welterweight Narciso Valenzuela, winning an easy unanimous decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez (16-0-1) took control of the bout in the sixth when a series of 
sharp overhand rights opened up a narrow cut over Valenzuela's left eye. Though 
the bleeding was not heavy through the rest of the fight, Valenzuela (35-16), 
best known for sending Oscar De La Hoya to the canvas before getting knocked 
out in the first round last October, had to limit his attack to protect the 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of dumb," Hernandez said. "I was trying to stop him with a 
one-punch knockout. I should listen to my corner (including trainer Jackie 
McCoy), and they were telling me to settle down, throw more punches."

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; ABBOTT ENJOYS HIS ESCAPE FROM N.Y. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Yankee pitcher Jim Abbott says he felt imprisoned in his own neighborhood. 
When he was traded to the Yankees by the Angels, he had thought living in an 
apartment in Manhattan would be special. But when you go 11-14 with a 4.37 
earned-run average, and all anyone talks about is baseball, city living loses 
its charm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't get away from baseball," Abbott said. "Every street corner has a 
newspaper, and there were always the headlines. I was constantly reminded of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tough year . . . but the experience last year made me grow up. It 
was a great experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott left his Manhattan apartment after last season, and is spending this 
season in Connecticut, loving every minute of it. "I found out I missed the 
ride home to and from the ballpark," said Abbott, who spent his first four 
seasons with the Angels. "It's a time you have to yourself. You couldn't do 
that with a cab." 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott, 2-2 with a 2.70 ERA, is eligible for free agency after the season. He 
might return to New York, but when he was informed that a New York tabloid 
reported that his velocity was down in his victory Sunday -- when he was eight 
outs away from his second no-hitter -- he could only shake his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's never enough," he said. "Just never enough around here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels will wait until Thursday to determine if left-handed reliever Ken 
Patterson needs elbow surgery. He underwent a magnetic resonance imaging test 
Monday that revealed a sprained medial collateral ligament, but will be 
re-examined Thursday after the swelling subsides. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson is expected to be put on the disabled list Wednesday, and Angel 
Manager Buck Rodgers said that he would like to replace Patterson with John 
Farrell of triple-A Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott, when being told that 92-year-old Angel coach Jimmie Reese is becoming 
fast friends with Bo Jackson: "That's Jimmie Reese for you, always going with 
the front-runner. First, Nolan Ryan, and now Bo Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spike Owen, who is being paid $500,000 this season and $2.75 million next year 
by the Yankees, was the Angels' starting shortstop for the first time this 
season. It was the first time in 231 games that shortstop Gary DiSarcina did 
not play because of a non-injury. . . . Starter Mark Langston, who is on the 
disabled list, left the team to be with his wife, who has been ill. . . . 
Catcher Chris Turner ended his hitless streak of 21 at-bats with his 
fourth-inning single. BOB NIGHTENGALE

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; JOHNSON, MARINERS DEFEAT CLEMENS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Randy Johnson outpitched Roger Clemens and Ken Griffey Jr. hit a home run 
Monday night as the Seattle Mariners defeated the Boston Red Sox, 4-2, at 
Seattle to end the Red Sox' six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson (2-1) pitched a five-hitter, giving up solo home runs by Andre Dawson 
and Scott Fletcher. He struck out nine and walked one in his second complete 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemens (2-1) gave up six hits and three runs, only one earned, in seven 
innings. He struck out six and walked three. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only the second time the two strikeout aces have met. On May 31, 1992, 
Clemens outpitched Johnson for a 7-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey, who hit his sixth home run during the fifth inning, went three for 
three against Clemens, making him 15 for 33 (.455) lifetime against the Red Sox 
star. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 4, Toronto 3 -- David Cone of the Royals struck out seven at 
Kansas City and overcame two home runs by Paul Molitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Molitor hit an inside-the-park home run to center in the first inning and hit 
a drive over the left field fence in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Cone (3-1) gave up six hits and walked two. Jeff Montgomery, who tied for the 
league lead with 45 saves last year, pitched the ninth for his first save. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 9, Cleveland 7 -- Dave Winfield reached another milestone by hitting 
one of the Twins' four doubles during a five-run seventh inning at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Winfield's double was his 525th, tying him with Ted Williams for 22nd on the 
all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Belle homered twice and drove in three runs for the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 8, Oakland 6 -- Cal Ripken doubled for the only hit during a 
five-walk, four-run sixth-inning rally for the Orioles at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Mussina (4-1) retired 18 consecutive batters after giving up six runs in 
the first two innings. He went 7 2/3 innings before Alan Mills snuffed an 
uprising in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Smith pitched the ninth for his 10th save. Smith reached the mark in 18 
games, faster than anyone in major league history; Mark Davis got his 10th save 
in 21 games for San Diego in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 13, Chicago 4 -- Teddy Higuera pitched six strong innings at Chicago 
for his second victory in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Seitzer, who drove in three runs, and Alex Diaz each had four of the 
Brewers' 18 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Cy Young Award winner Jack McDowell (1-3) gave up six runs on 11 hits in 4 2/3 
innings. He has given up 26 runs and 38 hits in 31 1/3 innings, and has a 6.60 
earned-run average after five starts.

 Dwight Gooden, the ace of the New York Mets' staff, will be sidelined at least 
four weeks because of an injured toe. The injury to his big right toe was 
discovered Monday during an MRI exam. An MRI on Bobby Bonilla showed the Met 
third baseman has a strained ligament in his left shoulder, and his playing 
status is day to day.

 The New York Yankees designated left-hander Bob Ojeda for reassignment. The 
Yankees had given Ojeda, 36, an opportunity to make the team in spring 
training, one year after a boating accident killed two of his teammates with 
the Cleveland Indians and injured Ojeda. Ojeda had no decisions and a 24.00 ERA 
in two starts with the Yankees.

SANTA ANITA; HIS FIRST SOUTHLAND TITLE WON, VAN BERG TURNS ATTENTION EAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack Van Berg didn't win the training title at Santa Anita with one arm tied 
behind his back, but he did finish the meeting with his right arm in a sling. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite undergoing surgery for an infection last week, Van Berg was at Oaklawn 
Park on Saturday to saddle Blumin Affair for a second-place finish in the 
Arkansas Derby, then he made a quick return for the final two days of the Santa 
Anita meet. Van Berg is on the move again this week, heading for Churchill 
Downs to supervise the final preparations for Blumin Affair before the colt 
runs in the Kentucky Derby on May 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Berg didn't win any races Monday, as Santa Anita's 90-day season ended on 
a rain-splattered track, but he didn't have to. His 33 victories left him five 
ahead of Bill Spawr in the final training standings. Van Berg has led the 
nation in victories nine times and was elected into the Racing Hall of Fame in 
1985, but this was his first seasonal training title in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the Santa Anita victories were by Blumin Affair, who ran only once at 
the meet, finishing fourth against older horses in an allowance race on March 
20. After that, Van Berg shipped the colt to Oklahoma, where he ran second in 
the Remington Park Derby. Blumin Affair has won only two races, both as a 
2-year-old, but his late-running seconds to Brocco in the Breeders' Cup 
Juvenile, to Smilin Singin Sam at Remington and to Concern at Oaklawn have 
convinced the 57-year-old Van Berg that he has a chance in the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Berg has been right before at Churchill Downs. In 1987, Alysheba went into 
the Derby with an undistinguished record and a recently corrected throat 
problem and won the race at 8-1. The tipoff was the Blue Grass Stakes at 
Keeneland, where he finished first only to be disqualified to third for 
interference. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Van Berg's Derby hopeful is in better shape than the trainer. "I've 
got to have surgery on the other arm too," Van Berg said. "How did I get this 
way? I'm just getting old, that's all. If I knew I was going to live this long, 
I would have taken better care of myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Berg didn't hit the top 10 nationally last year in purses or victories, 
but this year, through April 17, he is in third place on the money list with 
$1.7 million, not far behind Bill Mott and Gary Jones. At Santa Anita, led by 
Mamselle Bebette's four victories, Van Berg won eight stakes, finishing one 
behind Jones, who has led that category for four consecutive meets. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he had the lowest winning total since 1985, Kent Desormeaux won 22.6% 
of his races and earned his first Santa Anita title with 90 winners. Gary 
Stevens, who finished second with 79, rode in 73 more races than Desormeaux but 
skipped the final day of the meet because he was at Churchill Downs, aboard 
Santa Anita Derby winner Brocco for a mile workout. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 50 3/5 half-mile, Brocco finished in 1:40. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't handling the track well for the first half-mile," Stevens said, 
"but he adjusted to it pretty well and got over the track real well the last 
half-mile. He wanted to ease up with me a little bit at the sixteenth pole, 
because this stretch is a little longer than what he's used to back at Santa 
Anita. But I got after him a little bit and he picked it up again and galloped 
out real strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Chris McCarron rode 16 stakes winners to lead the Santa Anita meet. . . . 
Business was about the same on-track, but overall the $8.9-million daily 
average handle set a state record. There was an increase in off-track outlets, 
including intra-state satellites, out-of-state locations and the exchange of 
races daily with Northern California tracks. On-track, the betting average was 
$3 million, a drop of less than 1% from the previous year. On-track attendance 
dropped 4.5%, to 13,977 a day. The overall handle was up 21.6%. . . . Monday's 
sloppy going was the 12th off track of the meet, compared to 31 a year ago. . . 
. On a turf course listed as good, Square Cut led all the way to win the 
$111,200 San Jacinto Handicap by 3 1/2 lengths. The 5-year-old gelding, ridden 
by Fernando Valenzuela, has accounted for both of trainer Joe Devereux's stakes 
victories at Santa Anita.

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: PARQUE PITCHES HIS WAY TO CHANCE IN JUNE DRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Parque was good enough to earn a baseball scholarship to UCLA next fall. 
But the Crescenta Valley High senior's stock has risen considerably since he 
signed with the Bruins last November. 
</P>
<P>
 Major league scouts from nearly every team have been following Parque this 
season, and he is expected to be selected in June's amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are surprised at first glance that Parque is a major league prospect. At 
5 feet 9 and 145 pounds, the left-handed pitcher could easily be mistaken for a 
cross-country runner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know out on the field, I'm a little smaller than most of the guys," Parque 
said. "But I consider myself pretty normal in other situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Zarrillo, Crescenta Valley's coach, said size has always been an issue. 
He said Parque was 5-2, 110 pounds when he started high school and wasn't much 
bigger until this past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim has always had the attitude that his size would not be a hindrance," 
Zarrillo said. "In fact, he has used it as a source of motivation to show what 
he could do. I've never discouraged him from pursuing his goal of being a 
pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
 Parque, 18, said he has grown three inches since last summer and spent much of 
the off-season in the weight room. 
</P>
<P>
 Parque is 8-1 with an 0.55 earned-run average. He has struck out 94 in 51 
innings. He has given up 21 hits and 12 walks and has pitched five complete 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Parque's fastball has been clocked at 84 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley, which finished fourth in the Pacific League last season and 
missed the playoffs, is in first with a 12-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attention has been incredible, and I'm really enjoying it," Parque said. 
"The main thing now is not to let any of it go to my head. I want to keep my 
feet on the ground." 
</P>

 Glenn Martinez realizes his school is best known for winning football teams, 
but the La Puente Bishop Amat baseball coach is trying to change that image. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope people will look at Bishop Amat and comment that they have a pretty 
fair baseball program as well," said Martinez, in his eighth season at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers are receiving plenty of attention with their 20-0 record. They are 
ranked No. 1 in the Southland by The Times and No. 2 in the state by Cal-Hi 
Sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez said going undefeated takes a lot of luck and is not a team goal. 
Last year, Bishop Amat was 27-0 before losing to Tustin in the quarterfinals of 
the Southern Section Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "That undefeated streak put a lot of pressure on the players and coaches last 
year," Martinez said. "After the Tustin game, I didn't want people to look back 
on our season and only remember the loss. It's tough not to lose a game, so 
we'll just sit back and enjoy it and try not to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 This season's record is a bit of a surprise because the Lancers had only two 
returning starters, center fielder Mike Young and shortstop Steve Medrano. The 
pitching staff, led by Gabe Miranda (6-0) and Eric Valenzuela (7-0), is new. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 In an attempt to crack down on increased violence at athletic events, the 
Southern Section council is considering tough legislation for next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will vote Thursday on two rules that would penalize coaches and 
athletes who participate in fights. Any player, in the game or on the bench, 
who takes part in a fight would sit out the next game. Coaches would also skip 
a game for fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect some debate on the punishment for coaches," said Dean Crowley, 
Southern Section commissioner. "But we need to address the sportsmanship 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An absurd rule was rescinded last week when Marmonte League officials dumped 
the ban on postgame handshakes. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to curb violence that had plagued many Marmonte League games 
this year, league officials decided last month to do away with the handshakes, 
after which there were sometimes problems. The rule received widespread 
attention and was heavily criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 Many coaches were against the rule and did not follow it. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Christianson, league president and the principal at Agoura High, 
attributed the turnaround to the media crush. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think we did anything wrong," he said. "We still think there's a 
better way."

 Short-Term T-Bill Rates Rise to 2-Year High: The Treasury Department sold 
$11.4 billion of new three-month bills at an average discount rate of 3.85%, up 
from 3.76% last week. Another $11.4 billion of new six-month bills was sold at 
an average discount rate of 4.25%, up from 4.21%.The three-month bill rate was 
the highest since they sold for 3.95% on April 6, 1992. The six-month bill rate 
was the highest since they averaged 4.27% on April 27, 1992. The new discount 
rates understate the actual return to investors: 3.94% for three-month bills, 
with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,902.70, and 4.40% for a six-month bill 
selling for $9,785.10. The discount rate reflects the price discount received 
when government securities are purchased at less than face value. T-Bill

 Intel, CNN Plan PC Experiment: Intel Corp. and Cable News Network said they 
will test live multimedia news services on business personal 
computers.Beginning in May at a number of test sites, business PCs on local 
area networks, known as LANs, will display CNN news programs. "CNN is 
constantly looking to expand delivery of live news and information to new and 
diverse audiences," said Tom Johnson, president of CNN/Headline News. The 
venture will offer the live broadcast of CNN and Headline News on PCs. Intel 
and CNN did not say whether the picture quality will be comparable to that of a 
television.

POLITICAL MORASS COULD TRAP JAPAN'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY; TRADE: A SPLIT IN THE 
HOURS-OLD COALITION GOVERNMENT SENDS THE TOKYO STOCK MARKET LOWER AS INVESTORS 
LOSE CONFIDENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The political chaos that hit Japan's government early today, just 12 hours 
after the election of new Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, may derail an expected 
economic recovery and lead to worsening trade friction with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tokyo stock market's Nikkei index fell 118.92 points, or 0.6%, to 
19,590.22 in the first 18 minutes of trading this morning, reflecting 
investors' fears of a negative economic fallout from the collapse of the ruling 
coalition headed by Hata. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors "had bought the dream of return to efficient government led by a 
stable coalition and a prime minister who is very pragmatic," commented Jesper 
Koll, an analyst with S.G. Warburg Securities. "And you are now short somewhere 
around 60 votes of a majority (for Hata's government). Minority governments are 
inherently unstable . . . You have the knee-jerk reaction in the stock market." 
</P>
<P>
 The entire cabinet of outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa resigned en 
masse Monday, in preparation for Hata's election by parliament. But the naming 
of a new set of ministers, which normally takes place within hours, was blocked 
when the coalition split into conservative and leftist factions. Socialist 
Chairman Tomiichi Murayama announced early this morning that his party would 
leave the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama said his party would help pass a budget for fiscal 1994, which began 
April 1, but would no longer be bound by any other policy agreements with other 
coalition parties. Passage of the budget, which contains some measures designed 
to stimulate Japan's stagnant economy, is considered the most basic 
prerequisite to encourage renewed economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 But much more active market-opening and economic-stimulus measures will be 
needed to address trade disputes with the United States in the face of Clinton 
Administration threats to impose retaliatory trade sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan has pledged to produce a program by June to "substantially" reduce its 
$141 billion global trade surplus, including a $60 billion surplus with the 
United States. New action to stimulate economic growth, thereby pulling in more 
foreign goods through an increase in domestic demand, is a key element of what 
has been expected. But it is no longer clear that Hata's government will have 
the time or the political strength to focus on these issues before that 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "The promise of clarity over the fiscal stance has been shattered," Koll said. 
"You've got a government that is less likely to produce a permanent (income) 
tax cut, as desired by the U.S. government, before the July Naples summit (of 
the G-7 major industrial democracies)." 
</P>
<P>
 The sort of political upheaval that has now erupted had been feared for 
months, but many had hoped that the election of Hata would usher in a period of 
at least a few months of relative calm. Now the possibilities range from a 
quick political realignment that still gives Hata a working majority to a 
dissolution of the lower house of parliament and general elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the possibilities have investors and analysts worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have an election, and the result is not so good for the markets, that's 
a big factor of risk," Hirohiko Okumura, research director at Nomura Research 
Institute, said in a recent interview when it still appeared the coalition 
would hold together. Hata's elevation to be prime minister was expected to be a 
factor for political stability, he said. Now that confidence in basic 
continuity of government policies is gone.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: GOODWILL EFFORT TO MAKE DEADLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 When Keepers International, a Chatsworth-based hosiery manufacturer, needs 
extra help getting a big order out the door, company President Steele Davidoff 
often turns to a team of workers located about 25 miles from his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "With salaries and workers' compensation insurance, it's very expensive for us 
to hire and train extra people," said Davidoff, who instead relies on Goodwill 
Industries' contract services division to help meet tight shipping deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased with the work," Davidoff said. "It's a good way to 
contribute to the community, and they do an excellent job." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodwill, best known for its thrift stores, operates 160 contract services 
divisions across the United States, according to Nicholas Panza, president of 
Goodwill Industries of Southern California. The divisions recruit and train 
disabled or economically disadvantaged people, providing them with job skills 
and experience while also helping local business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our ultimate goal is to get these folks back into the real world," Panza 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles contract services manager Kathleen Moore divides her time between 
attracting new clients and conducting studies so she can bid on new projects. 
Once Goodwill wins a contract, a sample of the work to be done is shared with 
the team of workers assigned to the project. All the work is done at Goodwill's 
headquarters building on San Fernando Road, east of Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent morning, about 90 employees were busy in the airy, bustling 
workshop, carefully assembling boxes, inserting videotapes and affixing mailing 
labels to thousands of cassettes for a Disney resort promotion. Others were 
sorting thousands of hangers for return to Robinsons-May department stores, 
repacking bottles of salad dressing for a food importer and sorting reply cards 
for a philanthropic organization. One man was inspecting and sorting drill bits 
before they could be returned to a major aerospace company for sharpening. 
</P>
<P>
 Most months, there is plenty of work for everyone on the contract services 
division payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't hire people fast enough," Moore said as she surveyed the spacious 
work area. 
</P>
<P>
 Upstairs in another part of the building, Steve Golden has taken the concept 
even further and moved his own employees into the building to work side by side 
with the Goodwill workers. Golden's videocassette duplication and recycling 
company is keeping dozens of Goodwill workers busy. Golden, who owned a film 
company in Europe, came out of retirement at the urging of his friends to start 
Quest Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, he said, 300 million videocassettes flood the market and millions 
end up in landfills. Today, companies like his recycle and sell millions of 
used cassettes to consumers for home use. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year we recycled 6 million cassettes," Golden said. "This year we'll do 
12 million." 
</P>
<P>
 Quest's Goodwill workers are also trained to duplicate tapes by loading them 
into nearly 1,000 industrial-quality videocassette recorders. Most consumers 
would be surprised to learn that to maintain high quality, videotapes are 
duplicated one at a time and must be loaded and unloaded by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Goodwill workers are just as capable as anyone else," Golden said. "They 
have problems, but they are willing to work hard and willing to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as new machines are installed, Quest's workers will be trained to load 
raw videotape into the plastic cases.  
</P>
<P>
 Golden said the tape recycling and duplication business is growing so fast 
that he'll eventually be operating two shifts a day, seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodwill's Panza said that as his workers become more skilled, they move into 
more challenging positions. Eventually, they are encouraged to quit and move 
into the mainstream work world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We purposely try to lose our best employees," he said.

A COUNTRY DOCTOR FACES THE ERA OF AIDS; BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; MY OWN 
COUNTRY, A DOCTOR'S STORY OF A TOWN AND ITS PEOPLE IN THE AGE OF AIDS BY 
ABRAHAM VERGHESE . SIMON & SCHUSTER: $23, 347 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL DORRIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The world is indeed a small and interrelated place. 
</P>
<P>
 In hopes of finding a good environment to raise his children, Abraham 
Verghese, an Indian internist born in Ethiopia and trained in the United 
States, accepted a position at a VA hospital in Johnson City, Tenn. The job 
included an auxiliary appointment at the adjacent medical center (known locally 
as the Miracle Center), and without intending it, Verghese found himself "AIDS 
doctor" for a rural enclave that encompassed a large part of south-central 
Appalachia. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross-culturally, this circumstance is not as unusual as it might first 
appear. The staff physicians in the tiny community hospitals that served the 
scattered mining towns of southwest Virginia, east Tennessee and Kentucky were 
predominantly from India or the Philippines with a smattering of Pakistanis, 
Koreans and Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 As an outsider, part of an expatriate professional population distinctive as 
much for its advanced education as for its foreign origins, Verghese initially 
turns a clinically dispassionate observer's gaze on his patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, however, he feels at least spiritually (if not ethnically) 
integrated into the region, and comes to develop a number of close and enduring 
relationships with those men and women he treats who are HIV positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose," he writes, "this is when you know that a town has become your 
town: where others see brick, a broken window, a boarded up storefront, you 
feel either moved to tears or to joy. The map of the town becomes the map of 
our memories, the grid on which you play out your obsessions, on which you mark 
your great loves and your enmities; its geography becomes your destiny." 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of interesting, if not terribly compelling portraits, we meet the 
Johnsons, a patrician and very Christian husband and wife, senior citizens who 
are convinced that AIDS comes from the devil and not from God. 
</P>
<P>
 We encounter a series of gay men, some flamboyant, others tightly closeted, 
others married or involved in long-term relationships, who deal with their 
encroaching ailments with varying degrees of courage and anger. 
</P>
<P>
 Most memorable of all is Vickie, a muscular, heavyset woman who is revealed, 
beneath her fierce exterior, to possess a sweet and generous quality that 
enables her to accept her fate with surprising equanimity and dignity. Infected 
by her bisexual husband -- whom she nursed until his death -- she is capable of 
propelling sentimentality into a kind of bravery. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Doc, before you go . . . let me show you something,' she said after 
returning from taking her husband, infirm and half in dementia, on his last 
trips to the Grand Old Opry and the Knoxville Zoo. She pointed out a shrub on 
the other side of the road with red flowers on it. 'Do you know what that is?" 
</P>
<P>
 " '. . .It's called hearts-a-bustin' ,' ' Vickie said. She nodded emphatically 
when I looked at her in disbelief. 'Oh yes, hearts-a-bustin' . It's also called 
'swamp dogwood,' but I don't care for that much. Hearts-a-bustin': that's 
pretty much how I feel sometimes about what's happening to me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As a subtext to medical and social documentary aspects of "My Own Country," 
Verghese reveals the distancing he experiences in his marriage. He emerges as a 
lonely, non-judgmental man, a doctor whose natural instinct to heal is thwarted 
by the inexorable nature of the disease he must battle. 
</P>
<P>
 While "My Own Country" is a fascinating book in many respects -- establishing, 
among other things, the pervasive spread of AIDS into the hinterlands of 
America, "imported by native sons who had left long ago and were now returning 
because of HIV infection" -- it is somehow also less gripping that it should 
be. There's an illusive detachment here, an over-intellectualizing, as if 
Verghese keeps certain strong emotions at bay even from himself.  
</P>
<P>
 "Was my egalitarianism nothing but a cover-up for a deeply rooted prejudice? 
Was my outward proletarianism, my disdain for what I saw as the avarice of 
modern medicine, my compassion for gay men and for the underdog in general, 
merely a posture? 
</P>
<P>
 "If so, this posture was costly: It was responsible for the increasing sense 
of isolation I felt from my community, even from my wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "By taking up the cause of AIDS, I had become tainted, the associations for 
this word had tarnished me, I often felt as 'guilty' as the kind of people I 
cared for. Perhaps this was why I was so drawn to the Johnsons, the 
'innocents': they were an affirmation of my self-worth, of my innocence." 
</P>
<P>
 We come away from "My Own Country" with an abiding admiration for the good and 
compassionate work Dr. Verghese has conducted, but also with a regret that he 
did not more fully address in this memoir the tough questions that he posed to 
himself.

JOAN MITCHELL: A PAINTER UNDER THE INFLUENCES; THE AMERICAN, A SAMPLER OF WHOSE 
WORK IS AT THE NEWPORT HARBOR, WAS AFFECTED BY THE LIGHT AND THE TERRAIN OF 
NORTHERN FRANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Being known as the "second generation" has a rather depressing sound, as if 
you were incapable of doing much but imitating your forebears. 
</P>
<P>
 But the second-generation Abstract Expressionists, as they are known, are a 
worthy group in their own right. Although these painters didn't make the 
initial breakthroughs, their personal discoveries enriched the vocabulary of 
abstraction. And while the first generation was overwhelmingly male, the second 
wave included several women. 
</P>
<P>
 One was Joan Mitchell, who died two years ago at the age of 66. A sampler of 
five of her paintings is at the Newport Harbor Art Museum through May 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the earliest work in the group was painted in New York, the show is 
called "Joan Mitchell in Vetheuil" to draw attention to the artist's longtime 
residency in a village northeast of Paris where Claude Monet painted his 
Impressionist landscapes in the 1870s. (France happens to be the theme of the 
museum's big fund-raiser this year.) 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell was born into a cultured Chicago family -- her father was a doctor, 
her mother co-edited Poetry magazine. She spent a couple of years at Smith 
College, in Northampton, Mass., and earned a bachelor's degree from the School 
of the Art Institute of Chicago. (She also held a master's degree from New York 
University.) A $2,000 travel fellowship allowed her to study in Paris and 
Provence in 1948-49, where she met Barney Rosset, founder of Grove Press, whom 
she married. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in New York, Mitchell and Rosset settled in Greenwich Village, where she 
was one of the few women admitted to the Artists' Club and the "boy's club" of 
Abstract Expressionists who hung out at the Cedar Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Arshile Gorky's calligraphic brush strokes and vivid colors, and the slashing 
brush strokes Willem de Kooning had recently introduced into his paintings , 
were major influences on Mitchell's work, which was included in 1951 in the 
Club's "Ninth Street Show." Her first solo show was described by an Art News 
reviewer as "a savage debut," with "heroic-sized cataclysms of aggressive 
color-lines." 
</P>
<P>
 An untitled painting from 1952 in the Newport Harbor show is a lovely, 
passionate thing, hardly savage at all in today's terms. Jabs and curves, drips 
and skids of magenta, royal blue, forest green and yellow dart over a pale gray 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's whiplash brush strokes have been likened to ice-skating tracks, a 
description that seems exactly right in view of the dogged yet private quality 
of the swiftly curving lines in the 1952 work -- rather like a perfectionist's 
practice session on the ice. (And as Charlotte Rubinsteinpoints out in 
"American Women Artists," Mitchell was a champion ice skater as a child in 
Chicago.) 
</P>
<P>
 Intriguingly, when Marcia Tucker interviewed Mitchell for a 1974 catalogue of 
her work, the prickly, blunt-spoken artist suggested that her love of structure 
in painting was related to "a kind of plumb line dancers have," she said. "They 
have to be perfectly balanced, the more frenetic the activity is." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's marriage to Rosset broke up in 1952. Later that year she married a 
young market analyst named Alan Greenspan (now chairman of the Federal Reserve 
Board), whom she personally introduced to Ayn Rand, the novelist and devout 
believer in laissez-faire capitalism. But this marital union also was 
short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the New York art world was embracing new styles -- Pop art and 
hard-edge painting. Abstract Expressionism struck many observers as passe. In 
1955, Mitchell returned to Paris, and in 1959 she moved there permanently, 
settling down with Canadian painter Jean-Pierre Riopelle, a longtime resident 
of France who found inspiration in landscape for his heavily textured abstract 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Francis, a friend of Riopelle's, was another North American painter of the 
same generation whose style was energized by a stay in France, though a later 
visit to Japan would prove a greater influence on his work. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite New York's famous eclipse of Paris as the capital of the art world 
during the 1950s, some U.S. artists continued to find useful influences in the 
legacies of Impressionism, Cubism or surrealism. Ellsworth Kelly's studies in 
Paris in the early years of Abstract Expressionism, for example, led him to 
entirely different pictorial solutions involving simple shapes of monochromatic 
color. 
</P>
<P>
 For Mitchell, the key influences were the light and the terrain of northern 
France. (One wonders what would have become of her painting had she moved 
instead to California.) Although Mitchell denied Monet's influence on her work, 
she once said that her paintings "are about a feeling that comes to me from the 
outside, from landscape." 
</P>
<P>
 An Art News article from 1957 reported that, despite the impetuous look of 
Mitchell's large paintings, she produced them slowly, with the help of 
preliminary drawings in charcoal on the canvas. "I want to know," Mitchell 
said, "what my brush is doing." 
</P>
<P>
 A decade later, when her mother died, Mitchell inherited enough money to buy a 
stone house in Vetheuil, with views of fields and rivers -- the rhythms and 
colors that fed her paintings. After Tucker came to visit, she reported that 
Mitchell listened to music "of every kind" as she painted. Oddly, for someone 
whose works are so light-struck, her preferred working hours were late 
afternoon to dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Harbor exhibition, drawn from the Joan Mitchell Foundation and 
Robert Miller Gallery in New York, skips over most of the '50s and '60s, 
picking up the thread with "Chris's Dead Tree" from 1975, the year after 
Mitchell's solo show at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 A relatively small canvas, vaguely reminiscent of Philip Guston's delicate 
paintings from the '50s, "Chris's Dead Tree , " has a moody feel, with patches 
of Delft blue, green and a watery shade of melon drifting on a white ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The three late works in the show, from the '80s and '90s, each consist of 
several panels. As Charlotte Rubinstein points out, this approach can suggest 
the passage of time as the viewer reads from left to right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wood, Wind, No Tuba," a punningly titled painting from 1980, is the most 
assured of the three, with an intense yellow-orange blur of brush strokes 
rushing over a field of blue and white -- the intoxicating effect of being 
surrounded by a field of windblown flowers under the midday sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Erdita Fried," from 1981, is an exuberant, four-canvas fanfare of blue, 
fuchsia, orange and yellow, laid on with broad, overlapping strokes and small 
chunks of impasto. 
</P>
<P>
 Completed the year before Mitchell's death, "Wind" consists of skeins of 
bright color, spattered as if by a strong gust and "blown" apart to reveal the 
whiteness of the canvas surface. Loose and brisk, if perhaps a tad formulaic, 
this big-scale painting reveals nothing about the artist's infirmities (a 
recent hip operation limited her movements) but much about the connection 
between gesture, color, air and the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Joan Mitchell in V e theuil" remains through May 29 at the Newport Harbor 
Art Museum, 850 San Clemente Drive, Newport Beach. Admission: $4 adults, $2 
students and seniors, free for children under 12 and for everyone on Tuesdays.

MUSIC REVIEW; A TOUGH KNIGHT AT THE OPERA 
</P>

 Time for some eternal verities. Also some ancient bromides. 
</P>
<P>
 * The best-laid schemes o' Mike Milenski gang aft-kerfluey.  
</P>
<P>
 * Don't count your Falstaffs until they're wet. 
</P>
<P>
 * All operatic wives are created merry, but some are merrier than others. 
</P>
<P>
 * Throwing the book at the soprano doesn't necessarily set wisdom in flight. 
</P>
<P>
 * It isn't over till the fat gentleman sings. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the wonderful world of opera, anything that can go wrong will go wrong, 
especially if it's the wonderful world of opera in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Ford in your future isn't always the one you expect. 
</P>
<P>
 * All's well that ends. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tutto nel mondo e burla . 
</P>
<P>
 It all began last year when Milenski, dauntless leader of the ever-adventurous 
and always-beleaguered Long Beach Opera, decided to fulfill an unlikely dream. 
He wanted to stage Verdi's ultimate masterpiece, "Falstaff," within the 
intimate confines of the 800-seat Center Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, he believed, the subtle wit and wisdom of the quasi-Shakespearean text 
-- translated back into English -- could coexist with the sonic miracles of the 
autumnal score. 
</P>
<P>
 There would be some adjustments, of course. More than ever, the singers would 
be chosen for their theatrical as well as vocal skills. A canny director and 
designer would have to transform the modest playing area into a reasonable -- 
or, perhaps, delightfully unreasonable -- facsimile of King Hal's Windsor. 
</P>
<P>
 Most perplexing, perhaps, the mighty symphonic apparatus envisioned by the 
genial composer in his late 80s would have to be drastically reduced. No 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach made it a matter of pride long ago to rush in where fools fear to 
tread, and the company has regularly triumphed over impracticality. It just so 
happened, moreover, that a touring company in Birmingham, England, had come up 
with a chamber-size "Falstaff" that required only 16 players in the pit. 
</P>
<P>
 All went well, we are told, until friction between a soprano and a stage 
director began to ruffle ensemble composure during rehearsals. That's an 
understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 Milenski charged that Angelina Reaux, engaged to portray Alice Ford, had 
become a disruptive influence (the newly discovered Kathleen Battle syndrome?) 
and had made impossible demands regarding time off. The soprano countered 
through her manager that she had "suffered a physical assault at the hands of 
Moshe Leiser," who shared directorial duties with Patrice Caurier, and also, 
she claimed had "verbally threatened her life." 
</P>
<P>
 Milenski attributed the altercation to normal backstage stresses. He did 
confirm, however, that, in a moment of frustration, a score had been thrown in 
the direction of the prima donna. 
</P>
<P>
 Exit the prima donna. Exit with her, the originally scheduled Falstaff, who 
happened to be her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 This left Milenski scrambling at the last minute to find appropriate 
replacements for two central artists -- replacements, that is, who could 
quickly assimilate the complex staging patterns while performing a little-known 
English-language version of the opera. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 18, five days before the opening, Milenski had brought in a new 
Falstaff, John Rawnsley of London, and a new Mistress Ford, Nikki Li Hartliep 
of San Francisco. The show was saved, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite. 
</P>
<P>
 Rawnsley, remembered as a striking Rigoletto in San Diego's conventional 
production as well as in Jonathan Miller's modern-Mafioso edition, did not know 
"Falstaff" in English, and needed to keep the text at hand. Also, it was too 
late to indoctrinate the additions to the cast into the theatrical complexities 
of the production. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ergo, Milenski abandoned the sets, sent the costumes back to the warehouse, 
forgot all about his ideal of opera as valid modern drama, struck directors and 
designers from the program credits, canceled advertising, discouraged backstage 
interviews, mailed semi-apologetic explanations to his subscribers, and settled 
in desperation for something akin to a concert performance. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's what the customers got on Sunday afternoon. The mini-orchestra was 
placed in front of a narrow platform that supported a row of chairs and music 
stands. The sporty cast, dressed in improvised contemporary mufti, came and 
went, executed some dutiful mime, projected character as much as the 
anti-illusion circumstances would allow, sang neatly, toyed inventively with 
their music stands, and pretended not to notice that the all-important 
protagonist was paying more attention to the printed score than to his wily 
antagonists. 
</P>
<P>
 The result wasn't much of a "Falstaff" as "Falstaffs" go in serious opera 
houses. But it looked like a very pleasant, very promising Sitzprobe . 
</P>
<P>
 Sitzprobe ? That's a nice German word for an early rehearsal in which the cast 
sits around and reads through the challenge at hand, sketching 
characterizations along the way and faking the action in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Rawnsley sounded a bit dry but he sang nicely, even elegantly, as long as the 
vocal line didn't dip too low. Poised, charming and apparently unfazed, 
Hartliep sounded like the world-class diva she is. 
</P>
<P>
 The others, invariably supportive, were remarkably successful at masking what 
must have been considerable frustration. Kurt Ollmann seethed most agreeably as 
Master Ford. Robin Massie floated silvery pianissimo tones as Nannetta, in 
lyrical tandem with Bradley Williams' boyish Fenton. Kitt Reuter-Foss could not 
produce the gallon-jug contralto tones of the perfect Quickly, but she exuded 
plenty of pert cheer, nicely seconded by Kate Butler as Meg Page. 
</P>
<P>
 Beau Palmer's slender tenor and Scott Wilde's booming basso lent distinction 
to the ploys of Falstaff's honorable henchmen. Ross Halper whined deftly as Dr. 
Caius. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Sloane conducted with verve that contradicted neither humor nor pathos. 
The tiny orchestra tended to sound a bit tinny in Jonathan Dove's reduction, 
but it did uncover some stylish nuances and it did introduce some illuminating 
degrees of transparency. 
</P>
<P>
 * Opera is fun; opera is easy. 
</P>
<P>
 * The show must go on, after a fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Falstaff," presented in concert form by the Long Beach Opera at the Center 
Theater, 300 E. Ocean Blvd. Remaining performances Wednesday and Saturday at 8 
p.m. Tickets $22, $40, $60 (also student and senior discounts). Information

THEATER REVIEW; DROWNING IN SHALLOW 'SEA' OF '70S EXCESS; DIRECTOR ROOSEVELT 
BLANKENSHIP JR. STAGES AN ENERGETIC AND SYMMETRICAL PRODUCTION, BUT THE CAST 
OVERACTS WITHOUT ADDING ANY DEPTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The imagery in the title of Peter Dee's "A Sea of White Horses" -- the 
whitecaps on ocean waves -- is pure early '70s, when the sea as element was 
crucial to pop philosophy, just as it had been half a century before to Eugene 
O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee's drama seems just as period specific and cliched. Director Roosevelt 
Blankenship Jr.'s staging for Eastern Boys Productions, as energetic and 
symmetrical as he has made it, plays into its period, and, without the actors 
to bring it any sort of depth, it seems a little excessive and shallow. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Shaw (Michael Aquila) is a wanderer, a nomad who just misses being a hippie 
because of his lack of concern for anything outside of his own skin. He had a 
wife and two children, whom he deserted after her death, to live in a forsaken 
shack on a Florida beach. Before that he had a girlfriend he'd also skipped out 
on, leaving her with their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Why any of Shaws' three children want to find him is a dramaturgical question 
the playwright doesn't answer, except for hints at that fuzzy instinctual need 
to complete the human puzzle. He also doesn't explain how they all happen to 
converge on Ed's cherished privacy during one summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stephen (Steven Scholl) and Janice (Linda Rose Mongell) arrive, and Janice 
immediately takes poison, presumably to cure her father-deprivation Angst. They 
find Connie (Wichasta V. Reese), a half-sister they didn't know existed. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did they know that Connie and her mother were black. Neither is at all 
surprised at either revelation. "Oh," says Stephen, "you're my sister." The 
sibling question and the racial issues might have been explored to the play's 
dramatic benefit, but Dee is concerned only with the shallowly probed and silly 
anger of the children. At last they have found Daddy, and they proceed to 
scream hysterically at him and at each other. Then they leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as a period piece, the play lacks shape and focus, and the actors 
compound its problems by overacting in their simplistic performances, waving 
arms like windmills and shrieking and rolling on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Blankenship may have tried to temper this excess during rehearsal, but there's 
no way to control actors in performance. 
</P>
<P>

music awards show for several years) will be held June 26 at the Shrine 
Auditorium and broadcast on the cable channel that same evening. Honorees are 
Stevie Wonder, the symbol man (formerly known as Prince), Garth Brooks, Michael 
Bolton, Melissa Ethridge, Al Green and Kenny G. All of them are scheduled to 
perform on the two-hour show.

 * Shalala Lauds ABC: Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala is 
praising ABC for airing government-sponsored public-service announcements that 
feature condoms as a means of preventing the spread of AIDS among young people. 
In a speech Monday, Shalala said ABC has donated roughly half of the $2.5 
million in air time all networks have provided for the commercials. All four 
broadcast networks have aired the spots, which feature condoms (along with 
abstinence) as a method of preventing sexually transmitted diseases. But ABC 
was the first to air them and has continued to air them more frequently than 
other networks. Shalala said she plans to meet with the heads of networks and 
the cable industry "to convince them to do more" in airing the spots. MOVIES

 Spielberg Takes British Oscars Too: Director Steven Spielberg repeated his 
Oscar triumph at Britain's annual film awards Sunday night, picking up best 
film and best director prizes for "Schindler's List." Also repeating her Oscar 
victory was actress Holly Hunter, who won another trophy for her role in "The 
Piano." Other winners included Sir Anthony Hopkins, who boosted the flagging 
morale of the cash-strapped British film industry by winning the best actor 
award for his portrayal of a tightly buttoned butler in "The Remains of the 
Day." British actor Ralph Fiennes also made up for his Oscar defeat, winning 
the best supporting actor prize for his role in "Schindler's List"; and Miriam 
Margolyes, who played Mrs. Mingott in Martin Scorsese's "The Age of Innocence," 
was named best supporting actress. Among other British Academy of Film and 
Television Arts awards, a popularity prize based on votes from the general 
public went to Spielberg's dinosaur adventure "Jurassic Park," and a special 
award for outstanding British film went to Richard Attenborough for Hopkins' 
teary "Shadowlands."

 * 'River Wild' Release Delayed: Trouble may be brewing for the big-budget 
Universal Pictures release "The River Wild," starring Meryl Streep and David 
Strathairn as a couple who embark on a white-water rafting vacation in an 
effort to save their troubled marriage. Universal announced Monday that it was 
pulling the film from the crowded summer field and will instead release it 
Sept. 30. Such pushing back of release dates is often an indicator of problems, 
especially with big-budget films. The studio disputes that notion, however, 
saying that the move was prompted by "positive response from early research 
screenings," and that September is a "season that has traditionally proven to 
be successful for suspense dramas and award consideration." QUICK TAKES

 Radio station KPFK-FM (90.7) pays tribute to the late legendary filmmaker 
Federico Fellini on Wednesday with "Fellini: Federico of the Spirits," an 
hourlong documentary airing at 2 p.m. The program will repeat on Saturday at 10 
p.m. . . . NBC's "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno" was voted Europe's favorite 
television show in the 1994 Satellite Television and Radio Awards. Runners-up 
were Fox's "The Simpsons" and MTV's "Most Wanted." Satellite viewers in 38 
countries voted on the awards. . . . Fox's "America's Most Wanted" airs its 
300th episode on Saturday. That's apt timing considering viewers' tips last 
week led to law enforcement officials' capturing the 300th fugitive profiled on 
the show. SHAUNA SNOW

THEATER REVIEW; THOUGH DATED, 'BROADWAY' HAS BRIGHT SPOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 You have to know musicals to appreciate "Forbidden Broadway 1994," the revue 
at the Tiffany. Its clever lampoons of Broadway icons might be lost on those 
who don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Among its two-dozen sketches is a "Sunset Boulevard" takeoff mounted by the 
New York-based company for L.A. Without giving away the jokes, let's just say 
that writer-director Gerard Alessandrini not only puts Glenn Close (Susanne 
Blakeslee) and Patti LuPone (Christine Pedi) on the same stage and incorporates 
elements of the "Sunset" plot into their rivalry, but he also throws in Joe 
(Brad Oscar) and, best of all, a wickedly made up Andrew Lloyd Webber (Oscar 
again). Too bad there's no sign of Faye Dunaway or Diana Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 The zingers sting Close more than LuPone, but LuPone already took a few lumps 
in an unrelated "Evita" sketch earlier in the show. Alessandrini generally 
adheres to equal opportunity needling. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Sunset" sketch and a number about the expanding role of Disney on 
Broadway ("Be Depressed," to the tune of "Be Our Guest") rationalize the "1994" 
in the title. Some of the other material, while new to L.A., feels dated. That 
"Evita" sketch, for example -- it's been quite a while since Barbra Streisand 
or Madonna were considered for the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Madonna, obviously a tempting target, also is part of the show's only parody 
of a non-musical, a put-down of her appearance in David Mamet's 
"Speed-the-Plow" in 1988 in New York. While the adaptation of "My Fair Lady" to 
this situation is deftly done, it's a bit remote, especially for a non-New York 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 A sketch that attempts to parody Mary Martin and Ethel Merman surely predates 
the stars' deaths, which now make the number pointless and tasteless. Not that 
we weren't warned -- the opening song promises some below-the-belt humor. 
Pedi's plucky Merman impression is still a kick, but Blakeslee's Martin seems 
inaccurate as well as mean -- portraying the late star as wispy instead of 
perky. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the other sketches, however, appear freshly minted in the wake of 
recent musical offerings in L.A. We've seen so much Tommy Tune and Michael 
Crawford that Craig Wells' acerbic solo takeoffs on the two men sound as if 
they might have been created for L.A. Likewise with his Michael Damian in 
"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat," which was a big hit here before 
it went to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely there are plenty of customers who'll appreciate this company's thorough 
skewering of "Les Miserables." And Alessandrini's Sondheim spoof, "Into the 
Words," is almost as dazzling as a real Sondheim number. 
</P>
<P>
 Kudos also to wig designer Teresa Vuoso, costumers Alvin Colt and Erika Dyson, 
and pianist Brad Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
 The show concludes with an appeal to bring back shows with "heart" -- ironic, 
perhaps, considering this show's lack of it. But then satirists shouldn't worry 
about being nice, and these folks are the sharpest theater satirists in town. 
</P>

MUSIC REVIEWS; BRENDEL'S PROVOCATIVE BEETHOVEN SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The art of Alfred Brendel is complex, probing, concentrated, civilized. In his 
performances of great music -- we don't remember his ever playing unimportant 
scores -- the Austrian pianist analyzes, dissects, synthesizes and integrates. 
One of the reasons he is celebrated by other musicians is that he presents his 
findings without sweat, grandstanding or self-congratulation. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Brendel revisits the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion to give the third 
and fourth installments of his six-recital survey of the complete piano sonatas 
by Beethoven (he will play programs V and VI in May, 1995). Sunday night, his 
attention fell on the first three -- Opus 2, Nos. 1, 3 and 2 (in that order) -- 
and on Opus 57, the so-called "Appassionata." 
</P>
<P>
 As always with Brendel, he made memorable, provocative music in performances 
other musicians may talk about for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 In works thoroughly well-known, Brendel's reconsidered readings may surprise 
the listener, for they invariably reinstate aspects one may have forgotten. In 
the case of the very first of these 32 sonatas, the F-minor of Opus 2, the 
surprises on Sunday concerned its practically amazing cohesion, and the 
contrasts the composer built into it: the authority of the opening, the 
songfulness of the slow movement, the grace of the Menuetto, the gentle 
vehemence in the finale. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Too many other pianists have made this canvas sound dull; without 
exaggeration, and within a self-restricted dynamic range, Brendel gave it back 
its personality. 
</P>
<P>
 The C-major Sonata is the showpiece of this first set. The 63-year-old pianist 
let it speak for itself, breezily, matter-of-factly in the opening movement, 
seriously in the Adagio, with wonderful lightness in the Scherzo and finale. 
The cherishable, urbane A-major work, played after intermission, shows the 
young composer in his most Haydnesque -- he dedicated the entire Opus 2 to the 
older composer -- gracious and charming mode. Brendel allowed it to sing. 
</P>
<P>
 Directness was also his approach to Opus 57, wherein the composer's light and 
shadow made their points strongly but without overstatement, the slow movement 
moved inexorably toward its release in the finale, and that closing proved 
exciting but controlled. DANIEL CARIAGA

MUSIC REVIEWS; MANY AURAL AWARDS IN MISCHA CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A feeling of imminent loss mixed with pleasure was this listener's reaction to 
the Music for Mischa concert offered within the peaceful, handsome and 
acoustically inviting confines of the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 This was to be the last of the Mischa series, at least as a locally based 
entity, with the announcement of the forthcoming departure of its founder, 
Robert Martin, for a major administrative and teaching post at Bard College in 
Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin will be missed and remembered for his protean contributions to the 
local scene, as cellist of the lamented Sequoia Quartet, as a teacher (in both 
the philosophy and music departments) and administrator at UCLA, and not least 
for producing the stimulating Mischa series, dedicated to the memory of Mischa 
Schneider, cellist of the Budapest String Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
 But, before this begins to sound like a funeral oration, it should be reported 
that there were aural rewards aplenty in Sunday's program by the "Mischa 
Quartet": violinists Margaret Batjer and Sheryl Staples, violist Michael Nowak 
and cellist Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 First came the multiplicity of marvels that constitutes Haydn's Quartet in 
E-flat, Opus 64, No. 6, its presentation resounding with rhythmic alertness 
throughout and the multiple jokes of the minuet's inspired double trio 
zestfully, deftly projected. 
</P>
<P>
 The outer movements of Bartok's Second Quartet were delivered with their 
pained lyricism intact, as well as with a degree of polish in terms of centered 
intonation and ensemble balance that might be envied by many of our more 
experienced, permanently constituted ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
 If the ferocious central movement lacked contrast on this occasion -- the 
moments of respite the composer provided were subsumed under the general frenzy 
-- it could still be appreciated purely for the players' technical aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The concluding work was an old Sequoia and Music for Mischa specialty, 
Beethoven's "Harp" Quartet, vigorously, joyously, grandly stated.HERBERT GLASS

TV REVIEWS ; 'KIDS KILLING KIDS': TRYING TO STEM TIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With reports that seem to indicate the crime rate has declined somewhat, 
Americans are now hearing admonishments that their fears about criminal 
violence are misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet each day 14 children will be shot and killed. One of 25 black children now 
in kindergarten is expected to be murdered with a gun before age 18. An 
estimated 100,000 children bring guns to school every day. Gunshot wounds are 
now the leading cause of death among all teen-age boys in America. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics are from tonight's hourlong special, "Kids Killing Kids," a 
dead-serious mix of simple dramatized vignettes and commentary that offers 
alternatives to gun violence and emphasizes future-oriented thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Performed in an unsubtle, "Afterschool Special"-style that is geared to young 
people -- grades 5 to 12 are the target -- each of four vignettes shows how a 
teen-age boy finds tragedy when trying to solve a problem with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 A protective big brother tangles with a gangbanger, a stressed-out high 
achiever commits suicide over a broken romance, a promising baseball pitcher is 
paralyzed after he tries to confront a bully "like a man," and another boy 
accidentally kills a fellow student with the gun he carries to look cool. 
</P>
<P>
 The twist is that each boy gets a second chance. The film reverses to the 
point before the gun came into the picture to show how a gunless decision can 
save lives. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a tough sell, but an urgent one: Young people are asked to see far enough 
beyond an immediate problem so that talking to others, running away, or even 
humbling themselves to defuse a situation, are worthwhile alternatives to gun 
violence. The glamorization and easy obtainability of guns -- from a friend, 
from parents' night stands, for $25 on the street -- is the condemnatory 
subtext. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Kids Killing Kids" airs at 8 tonight on CBS (Channels 2 and 8) and Fox 
(Channels 11 and 6), and at 5 p.m. on cable's Faith & Values Channel. LYNNE

TV REVIEWS ; THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO 'MANDELA' STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Mandela" is a misleading title for tonight's report on PBS, co-produced by 
"Frontline," the BBC and Channel Four in Britain. "Mandelas" is more like it. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowning irony behind today's South African election, virtually conceded 
to African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, is that while Mandela may 
have forged friendlier relations with his former fearsome rival, Inkatha 
Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, his new harshest rival may be 
his estranged wife, Winnie Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broadcast's opening half-hour, BBC reporter Michael Buerk traces 
Mandela's rise to power, while "Frontline's" (and veteran National Public Radio 
South African watcher) John Matisonn examines Winnie's rise and fall and new 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
 The hour's most interesting dimension is the unveiling of the future 
President's real rival (the report was finished before Buthelezi's surprising 
decision to join the national election), but it's also linked with the report's 
most astonishing failure. Though Matisonn clearly explains the painful history 
of Winnie Mandela's persecution during her husband's decades-long imprisonment 
-- and her inevitable radicalization -- nowhere is Nelson's political evolution 
explained. She is now at the ANC's militant left flank, and he is its most 
eloquent centrist. How did this come to be? 
</P>
<P>
 Despite one of the most elegantly written voice-over reports to be found in 
any "Frontline" report -- and that is saying a lot -- Buerk neglects to track 
for U.S. viewers how Nelson Mandela first became an ANC leader in the '50s, and 
how his long-held vision of a democratic, non-racial South Africa was deeply 
informed by socialism. Mandela's vision grew more centrist and more willing to 
mix capitalism and socialism as he grew older in prison. By his release in 
1990, and now during election campaigning, the former icon of revolution has 
grown to oppose leftist and rightist violence, socialized takeover of 
white-owned property and the rhetoric of race-baiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Winnie could not be more different, as Matisonn shows with clips on the 
campaign trail and confrontations with police. While her suspended sentence for 
involvement in the killing of young Stompie Seipei by her bodyguards alienated 
her from the ANC brain trust, she has gradually reasserted herself as "a voice 
of the people," a grass-roots radical. 
</P>
<P>
 Winnie's interest in maintaining the division -- and dogging the ANC 
establishment to follow through on all of its many campaign promises -- utterly 
conflicts with Nelson's hope of a growing democratic, multiracial middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you spell d-i-v-o-r-c-e? 
</P>
<P>
 * "Mandela" airs tonight at 9 on KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV Channel 15,

 FEELING WANTED: He's not sure what a few extra words of encouragement will do, 
but Supervisor William G. Steiner will introduce a resolution the supervisors 
are expected to pass today supporting efforts to keep the Los Angeles Rams at 
Anaheim Stadium -- in Steiner's district. . . . The team is an important

 HAPPY REPLAY: There will be sad moments Wednesday afternoon as the nation pays 
its last respects to Richard Nixon. But in the evening, a look at some happier 
times for the Nixons will be reprised on South County's Dimension Cable by 
"Insight Orange County" host Jerald Lasenski. . . . At 7:25, he's

 BELL RINGER: Basketball broadcaster Dick Vitale has such high energy, some may

 MARTHA'S WOMEN: If you're already complaining about $7 for a movie -- sans 
popcorn -- would you pay $10 to watch a documentary? Even with Jodie Foster 
narrating? . . . The county's Homeless Issues Task Force is counting on just 
that. "It Was a Wonderful Life," plays at the Trinity Episcopal Church in 
Orange at that price tonight at 7. Foster chronicles the lives of six former 
middle-class women who wound up homeless. Your money goes toward helping the 
Martha House, a homeless women's shelter in Orange.

 NIXON'S DAY: It's a tradition to close the federal government for a day to 
mourn a President's death. It also carries a big price tag: $331 million in 
wages for work not done and overtime pay (A8) . . . . Both of Ventura County's

 WHAT A COMMUTE! Futurists say computers will allow more and more workers to

to monitor computer networks. And he just set up U. S. headquarters in 
Camarillo (Valley Business, Page 12). Why Camarillo? "Because," Riley said, 
"that's where I happen to live."

 LAST SMOKES: Beginning today, Ventura becomes the fourth city in Ventura 
County to abolish smoking in most public places (B1). . . . Most of Ventura's 
City Council members are worried about the health risks of breathing secondhand 
smoke. In January, they voted to ban smoking in restaurants, offices and even 
bars if more than a quarter of a bar's monthly tab comes from the sale of food. 
Meanwhile, Oxnard leaders today also will consider revising the smoking rules 
in the county's largest city.

 RUSSIAN MISSION: Tom Kemp, head of the U. S. Committee to Assist Russian 
Reform, speaks tonight in Camarillo on helping in Russia's march toward 
democracy and departure from a military-based economy. . . . The World Affairs 
Council hopes for an impressive turnout at the Spanish Hills Country Club, said 
David Baker, who is helping publicize the event. "We want him to call his 
brother Jack and get him to come to the World Affairs Council," Baker said. 
Jack Kemp, the former U. S. Housing Secretary, is a likely presidential 
candidate in 1996.

KARL HESS; GOLDWATER'S SPEECH WRITER IN 1964 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Karl Hess, a Republican speech writer who worked as U.S. Sen. Barry 
Goldwater's presidential campaign phrasemaker in 1964, has died. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident of Kearneysville, W. Va., Hess died Friday in a Charlottesville, 
Va., hospital of an undisclosed illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Hess was probably best known for coining Goldwater's famous campaign slogan: 
"Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice; moderation in the pursuit of 
justice is no virtue." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a sad loss," Goldwater said Monday. "He was a very dear and valued 
friend, one of the finest writers I have ever known. I am going to miss him." 
</P>
<P>
 Hess was a speech writer for the Republican National Committee, and briefly 
for President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Vice President Richard Nixon and various 
Republican senators and congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
 He helped write the Republican Party's platforms in 1960 and 1964, and later 
wrote several books on politics, including "In a Cause That Will Triumph: The 
Goldwater Campaign and the Future of Conservatism," published in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of Goldwater's "Arizona Mafia," Hess was described during the 
presidential campaign as "a round, cheerful man . . . a dedicated right-wing 
ideologue who is even more conservative than the senator." As he sat in San 
Francisco hammering out the party's platform that year, Hess was described by 
The Times as "intense in his devotion to the cause of conservatism in 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
 After Goldwater's defeat, Hess appeared to bolt across the political spectrum 
to become a Libertarian. He believed, however, that conservative and 
libertarian thinking were similar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I moved in a direction which the FBI chooses to call 'leftward,' " he once 
said. "What I actually did was go to work as a commercial welder, get arrested 
for demonstrating against the Indochina War, work with Black Panthers and teach 
a course on anarchism." 
</P>
<P>
 Hess ran for governor of West Virginia as a Libertarian in 1992, but failed to 
get the required number of signatures to make the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really expect to get the job," he said. "I am running for the right 
of people to be represented on the ballot, which is so fundamental to our form 
of government." 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his second wife, Therese Machotka Hess of Kearneysville, and 
two sons, Karl Hess IV and Eric Hess.

 Foothill, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Track / Sprints-long jump 
</P>
<P>
 Oettinger's performance Saturday at the Orange County Championships was 
unprecedented. It's not just that she won county titles in four events -- the 
long jump, the 100, 200 and 400 meters -- but how she won them.Each of her 
marks is among the top five in the history of the meet. In the long jump, her 
specialty, she went 18 feet 2 1/2 inches. That's 9 1/4 inches short of her 
season best, but the third best mark in county meet history. Her 12.43 in the 
100 and 25.17 in the 200 were each the fourth best ever and in the 400, her 
time (57.72) was the fifth best. Other notables: 
</P>
<P>
 * Andrea Pickett, Pacifica, batted .778 with five walks and three RBIs as the 
Mariners tied first-place Kennedy and won two other games. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stefanie Noffsinger, Huntington Beach, pitched a no-hitter, striking out 13, 
in a 5-0 victory over Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wendy O'Brien, Irvine, was named swimmer of the meet at the Foothill Games 
after winning the 50 (23.93) and 100 freestyle (51.98). 
</P>
<P>
 * Robin Tessman, Foothill, pitched eight innings of no-hit relief in a 1-0, 
12-inning victory over Canyon.

 Swimming / Sprints 
</P>
<P>
 The sprints in swimming are usually decided by slim margins, but Lezak's 
performance was anything but the norm Saturday at the Foothill Swim 
Games.Lezak, the swimmer of the meet, didn't have to touch out anyone to win 
the 50- and 100-yard freestyle events: He won each by more than a second. He 
won the 50 in 21.30 seconds, a meet record and almost 1 1/2 seconds ahead of 
the field, and the 100 in 47.30. He won each by at least a body length. He also 
was the anchor on Irvine's freestyle relay teams, which won the 200 and 
finished second in the 400. Other notables: 
</P>
<P>
 * Mike Clark, Kennedy, hit a grand slam on a 3-2 pitch in the bottom of the 
seventh to give the Fighting Irish a 6-4 victory over Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
 * Troy Langley, Canyon, set a school high jump record by clearing 6-10 1/4 in 
a dual meet with Foothill. He also won county championships title. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jaime Martinez, Orange, won the 1,500 meters (3:56.89) and the 3,000 
(8:38.94) by large margins at the county championships. 
</P>
<P>
 * Philip Schildts, Calvary Chapel, had 24 kills in a four-game victory that 
stopped Whittier Christian's 47-match volleyball winning streak.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL: KOSSUB REALIZING HER GOALS AT OCC 
</P>

 Brandi Kossub decided to come to Orange Coast College long before she knew 
anything about the women's swimming program, which is the best in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Kossub, from Katella High School, said she was looking for a place that felt 
more like college than Fullerton and Cypress, where many of her high-school 
classmates went. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know anything about (OCC's team)," Kossub said. "I was going to come 
here anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 But at Orange Coast, Kossub discovered much more than atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 She met Coach Don Watson, who challenged her to work harder and perform better 
than she thought she could. 
</P>
<P>
 Kossub started swimming with the Anaheim Aquatics Assn. when she was in junior 
high school. She swam four years of varsity, advancing to the Southern Section 
swim meet each year. She was the Empire League swimmer of the year in the 
spring of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Watson's help, teammates' encouragement and Kossub's desire, she 
continued to improve and has become one of the best swimmers in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Kossub remembers her first meeting with Watson, who told her she could trim 
her time in the 100-yard backstroke to 59 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought there was no way I could ever go that fast," said Kossub, who 
eventually got down to 58.88 last year. "Even when I did, I didn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kossub set a national record in the 50 backstroke (27.56 seconds) and also won 
the 100 backstroke at last year's State meet. 
</P>
<P>
 She was also on the 400 medley relay team that set a State record as OCC won 
its fifth consecutive State title and its ninth in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Kossub has had another strong season this spring and has made an oral 
commitment to Drury College, an NAIA school in Springfield, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 She has two meets left in her OCC career. The Pirates are the overwhelming 
favorites at the Orange Empire Conference championships Thursday through 
Saturday at Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
 OCC will also be the favorite when Kossub defends her titles at the State meet 
May 5-7 at Cypress College. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's really just nothing not to like about her," Watson said. "When she 
does really well, it has a snowball effect. The rest of the kids really feed 
off her success." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Baseball update: The Orange Empire Conference race enters its final two weeks 
today.  
</P>
<P>
 Riverside (27-8, 14-5 in conference), leads second-place Cypress by half a 
game. The teams meet at Cypress at 2:30 p.m. today. The Chargers (27-10, 13-5) 
visit sixth-place Fullerton (16-17-1, 7-12) at 2:30 p.m. Thursday, then play 
host to seventh-place Orange Coast (7-24, 2-17) at noon Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside has a bye Thursday, then plays host to Fullerton at noon Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago, which has won five of the last six conference titles, won 
three games last week to move into third place, two games out of first. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons (29-9, 12-7) have a bye today but visit fifth-place Golden West 
(15-17, 8-11) at 2:30 p.m. Thursday and play host to fourth-place Saddleback 
(20-12-1, 10-9) at noon Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Scanlon, a sophomore on the Saddleback tennis team, has been selected as 
the Orange Empire Conference player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanlon, from Santa Margarita High School, was 13-5 overall and 8-1 in 
conference at No. 1 singles. He was 12-3 in doubles, including 7-0 in 
conference. He is top-seeded in the conference tournament Thursday to Saturday 
at OCC.

 In another blow to the postseason hopes of the Cal State Northridge baseball 
team, shortstop Chad Thornhill might be out indefinitely due to an elbow 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornhill, a junior transfer from Fresno City College, was injured in a 
collision near first base in Sunday's 14-6 loss to Cal State Sacramento. 
Preliminary examinations indicated that Thornhill suffered a fractured bone in 
his right elbow, a school official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornhill has ranked among team offensive leaders all season. He is batting 
.278 with 26 runs batted in.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; COACHES ARE GLAD MAYEDA NEEDED SOME FRESH AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe if he had run into the track offices at Irvine, David Mayeda would have 
earned instant respect. As it was, assistant track coach Jim Hiserman considers 
it one of his easiest recruiting successes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just walked into our office last summer, said he was transferring to UCI 
and wanted to run track," Hiserman said. "We'd never seen him run, so I asked, 
'What do you do?' He said, 'The 400 and 400 hurdles.' I said, 'What do you 
run?' He said, 'Forty-nine and 53.' 
</P>
<P>
 "So we were pretty excited." 
</P>
<P>
 What Hiserman didn't know then, he is constantly amazed by now. Mayeda's 
potential is just beginning to be explored. He considered himself first a 
wrestler and then a football player at University High while dabbling at track. 
For two years at UC Riverside, he concentrated on track but couldn't seem to 
tap all that potential. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, however, he has the Big West Conference's best time in the 
400-meter intermediate hurdles (51.70), ranks No. 3 in the 400 meters (48.11) 
and No. 10 in the 200 (22.27). 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaching here is incredible," Mayeda said. "I mean my body is maturing 
and I'm stronger than ever, but I give the coaching most of the credit. I've 
always considered myself to be a hard worker, but in the past I've been working 
too hard. Plenty of quantity but not enough quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning of this season, my (hurdling) form was awful. I haven't seen 
myself on tape that much since then, but I feel a lot more efficient, a lot 
smoother." 
</P>
<P>
 Hiserman isn't sure just how fast -- or how far -- Mayeda can go, but he is 
sure he'll lower his best time in the hurdles enough to qualify for the NCAA 
championships. The NCAA qualifying time is 50.70. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best race he's run this year, he had four bad hurdles out of 10," he 
said. "He had too much air time, took too many steps. If you smooth out just 
two of those hurdles, he'll run 50.5, 50.6. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had never alternated legs before. He ran 17 strides every hurdle, which is 
pretty hard to believe. But he's working on changing that because the person 
who takes the fewest steps in the 400 hurdles is going to win almost every 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "David is learning more with every meet. We go over each hurdle after a race, 
the touch-down times after each hurdle and now he coaches himself. He's 
intelligent and is very good at analyzing a race. Plus, you couldn't ask for a 
better competitor." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayeda says part of his improvement can be traced to his work last fall as an 
assistant football coach at Sonora High. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of the most gratifying experiences of my life," said Mayeda, who 
coached defensive backs and running backs. "We went from 3-7 the season before 
to 6-5 last year and made the playoffs for the first time in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of fun together and I lifted (weights) with the players a lot. I 
think that upper-body strength that I never had before has really helped. It 
seems to carry me through the last 150 meters." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayeda could be in his third track season with the Anteaters and running who 
knows how fast by now, but he ended up at UC Riverside because it was the only 
school to offer him a "warm welcome." Warm soon turned to hot and smoggy, 
though, and Mayeda sought the clean air of home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't recruited by anybody," said Mayeda, whose goal this season is to 
break the Irvine school record of 50.64. "I had to contact coaches. Riverside 
was at least receptive. Irvine wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Give the Anteater coaches this much credit. They didn't blow it the second 
time around. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Point, counter point: Coach Rod Baker, who pulled off a major recruiting coups 
and filled a huge void at point guard last week when Riverside College's 
Raimonds Miglinieks signed a letter of intent, has solidified the position. 
</P>
<P>
 Raheem Muhammad, a 5-7 point guard from Los Angeles City College, signed a 
letter of intent and will have three years of eligibility with the Anteaters. 
Muhammad averaged eight points and six assists last season for LACC, the 
nation's 13th-ranked community college team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Raheem is a guy who will come in and be able to sustain us (at point guard) 
for a while," Baker said. "He's a good, solid kid and a solid student." 
</P>

 Music: PolyGram Chief Executive Alain Levy is expected to disclose a 
restructuring of part of the company's music operation as early as Wednesday. 
Sources confirmed a report in Hits magazine that the company will dismantle its 
PolyGram Label Group.PolyGram formed PLG as an umbrella company in 1990 to 
handle worldwide marketing for PolyGram's London, Polydor, Smash and Island 
labels. At the time, PolyGram wanted to have a central company handling sales, 
marketing and promotion for record labels it was acquiring. But a strong 
performance by Island in particular -- which boasts such artists as U2 and 
Melissa Etheridge -- is prompting PolyGram to cut out that layer so the labels 
can handle the marketing functions themselves. A PolyGram spokeswoman declined 
to comment. JAMES BATES

UNREPENTANT POWELL DEFENDS BEATING OF KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angry and unrepentant, an officer convicted of violating Rodney G. King's 
civil rights said Monday that he still believes he did the right thing, adding 
that on the night of the 1991 incident, he came close to shooting King. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't think you did anything wrong that night?" King's lead lawyer, 
Milton Grimes, challenged Officer Laurence M. Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I not only don't think it, I know it," Powell shot back. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, the LAPD officer who struck the most blows against King, was brought 
to Los Angeles from a federal prison in Northern California to testify in the 
second phase of King's suit for civil damages. Now serving a 30-month sentence 
for his role in the notorious incident, the thick-set 30-year-old took the 
stand in a green suit that his lawyers said he had borrowed from a law 
enforcement friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a jury awarded King $3.8 million in compensatory damages for his 
injuries. The jury is now being asked to consider punitive damages against 15 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell is one of those defendants, and he defended his actions with 
undisguised fury, unleashing such torrents of words at times that Grimes 
complained to the judge that Powell was making a soapbox of the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge John G. Davies refused to intercede. But on another point, 
the judge ruled that a controversial message Powell sent by computer on the 
night of the beating -- a reference to a domestic dispute involving a black 
family as "right out of 'Gorillas in the Mist' " -- was admissible as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 King testified earlier in the trial that he believes he was beaten because he 
is black. The officers who beat him, including Powell, are white. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday, Powell denied that the computer message -- a reference to a 
then-current movie about apes -- was meant to be racial. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reminded me of the scene from the movie," Powell said. Furthermore, he 
said, no racist remarks were made during the March 3, 1991, beating. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no racial slurs out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Through questioning, Grimes took Powell back to the start of his work shift at 
the LAPD Foothill Division that day. Powell admitted that he had been 
criticized at roll call for delivering weak baton blows during an exercise at 
the station. 
</P>
<P>
 But Powell said the criticism had nothing to do with his eventual role in the 
fateful beating that night. Rather, he said, his police training and the 
commands of his sergeant, Stacey C. Koon, led him to believe that the most 
appropriate response to King's behavior was to draw his baton. 
</P>
<P>
 Another witness, Theodore J. Briseno, would later testify that Powell had been 
out of control. Briseno, who was among the officers who subdued King, was 
acquitted in state and federal trials. 
</P>
<P>
 But Powell said he beat King because he feared for his safety. King, he said, 
had exhibited all the characteristics of someone high on the drug PCP -- he was 
incoherent, had resisted officers with seemingly superhuman strength and had 
refused to follow commands. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, in fact, he thought he might have to shoot or even kill King. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to become a statistic," Powell said, "because I've stood at a 
graveside too many times, hearing 'Amazing Grace' on a bagpipe from a distant 
hillside." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that after the beating occurred, he did send a message by 
police car computer saying, "Oops! I haven't beaten anyone this bad in a long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 The message, he said, was a means of letting off steam did not convey remorse. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does oops mean to you, officer?" Grimes asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just an exclamation," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a mistake?" Grimes asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Powell insisted. ". . . What I was conveying was, 'Here's a quiet night 
and look what happened.' 
</P>
<P>
 "All I could think was, 'Wow, I survived this,"' Powell said. "This was an 
incident that shocked me and scared me." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he added: "You can't just cry. We talk to each other. This is just how we 
talk. Otherwise, you would have policemen going home and sticking a gun in 
their mouths and blowing their heads off." 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you finished?" Grimes asked testily. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I am," Powell said.

FAMILY SETTLES WITH CITY IN SLAYINGS OF 2; COURTS: SURVIVORS OF BROTHERS SHOT 
TO DEATH BY A COMPTON OFFICER IN 1991 WILL RECEIVE $4 MILLION TO $6 MILLION. 
THE SLAYINGS HAD OUTRAGED THE SAMOAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The family of two unarmed brothers shot to death in their driveway three years 
ago by a Compton police officer answering a domestic dispute call will receive 
$4 million to $6 million under a settlement reached Monday with the city of 
Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Evans, Compton's risk manager, said the settlement will be disbursed 
in a combination of cash payments and annuities. Evans estimated the total 
payout at $4 million to $5 million, according to the Associated Press. Jerry 
Steering, a lawyer for the victims' family, put the figure at about $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement was reached one day before a civil trial was scheduled to start 
in federal court in Downtown Los Angeles, Steering said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pouvi Tualaulelei, 34, and his brother, Italia, 22, together were shot 19 
times by Officer Alfred Skiles Jr., who contended that he acted in self-defense 
after the men attacked him Feb. 12, 1991. Eight of the bullets struck Pouvi 
Tualaulelei in the back and five shots entered Italia Tualaulelei through his 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit named Skiles and the city of Compton as defendants. George Franscell, 
who represented Skiles in the civil case and a criminal case, could not be 
reached for comment. Neither could Skip Campbell, the lawyer who represented 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate survivors of the Tualaulelei brothers -- their mother, Annie; 
and the wife and six children of Pouvi Tualaulelei -- originally sought $100 
million in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Steering said the family was satisfied with the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a lot of money," he said. The amount, he added, was the first and only 
offer made. 
</P>
<P>
 The money is to be paid out in lump sums and annuity installments, Steering 
said. He said he expected the city to pay Skiles' portion. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement brings to a close a case that had galvanized Southern 
California's Samoan community and prompted the concern of Western Samoan 
officials stationed in Washington, D.C., and on the Pacific island nation.  
</P>
<P>
 The Tualauleleis had migrated from Western Samoa, where Pouvi worked as a 
police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Samoan American activists, who labeled the incident a blatant instance of 
excessive use of force by an officer, staged several protests. Police 
overreaction is common when officers deal with Samoans, the activists said, 
because they mistakenly believe the Samoan culture is violent. 
</P>
<P>
 Pouvi Tualaulelei's wife, Julie, told authorities that Skiles -- patrolling 
alone -- appeared outside the family home the night of the shooting after she 
called police and told them her husband had struck her.

 Skiles, she said, locked her in his patrol car and approached the brothers, 
who were standing in their driveway. An argument ensued and, Julie Tualaulelei 
said, she heard a barrage of gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 A third Tualaulelei brother, who was inside the family's home, said he heard 
Skiles order his brothers to their knees before the shooting started. 
</P>
<P>
 At Skiles' criminal trial, the prosecution contended that after he felled the 
Tualaulelei brothers with nine shots, Skiles coolly reloaded his firearm and 
shot them at least 10 more times. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a jury deadlocked 9-3 in favor of acquitting Skiles of voluntary 
manslaughter. By then, he had retired from the force. A judge later blocked an 
attempt by prosecutors to have Skiles retried.

WHEN THE MUSIC STOPS; CHOIRMASTER SLAIN IN HOLDUP IS REMEMBERED FONDLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a city where violence has become commonplace, the death of David John 
Falconer was tragically typical: A man stops at a convenience store on his way 
home from work, is held up and gets shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
 But the life of David John Falconer -- well, that was another matter entirely, 
as the parishioners and children of the St. James Episcopal Church and School 
in Hancock Park can testify. 
</P>
<P>
 To the hundreds of people who mourned Falconer this week, the 40-year-old 
organist and choirmaster with the graying beard and imposing height was as 
extraordinary as the cause of his death was needless. 
</P>
<P>
 Here was a teacher who could inspire an inner-city 12-year-old with the 
soaring trumpet fanfares of Telemann and Bach. His elementary school pupils -- 
all 330 of them -- could listen to a bit of a tune and not only tell you that 
it sounded like Schubert but then go on to tell you why. 
</P>
<P>
 So dedicated was he to his job as church organist that he almost 
single-handedly raised the $750,000 now being spent to restore St. James' 
historic Murray Harris pipe organ. So popular was he as the parish's 
choirmaster that 75 children a year at the St. James school gave up recesses 
just to sing for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That a man like this should get cut down in the prime of life is so hard to 
believe," said the Rev. Kirk Smith, St. James' pastor. 
</P>
<P>
 Noted 12-year-old Eddie Thayer, a sixth-grader at the St. James school: "When 
he died, a part of the school went with him." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Falconer's friends and Los Angeles police, Falconer was killed 
shortly after 10 p.m. on Thursday outside a Los Feliz convenience store near 
Hillhurst and Franklin avenues. Three gunmen confronted him as he was getting 
into his car. What they wanted is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 Choir practice had just ended Thursday night when the slaying occurred, and 
Falconer was heading home to the Silver Lake house he had bought two years ago 
with his life partner of 10 years, the Rev. David Charles Walker. 
</P>
<P>
 "He liked to have beer and popcorn when he came home from choir," Walker said, 
"and often he'd stop on his way home to pick up a can of beer." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, 56, said he had often worried for Falconer's safety on the nights he 
worked late at St. James, a stately parish whose ornate, cream-colored facade 
is wedged like some gracious artifact of gentler times among the appliance 
storefronts and high-rises of Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 But as time passed, he said, he learned to relax, and on the night of 
Falconer's death, he went to bed early and left the lights on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I awoke at 2:30," he said, "and realized that the lights were still on." 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmed, he called a member of the choir. No, she said, rehearsal had ended on 
time. Walker dashed to his car and drove to the church. Falconer's car was not 
in the lot. Terrified, Falconer's friend, a white-haired, bespectacled man with 
round, pink cheeks, finally drove to the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Rampart Division, where a desk sergeant confirmed his worst fears. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker arrived at County-USC Medical Center just in time to be greeted by a 
surgeon who told him that the bullet had entered Falconer's torso under one arm 
and ripped through his vital organs before exiting at his waist. His pulse was 
just a whisper when the paramedics had arrived. Walker was sent to the morgue 
to identify the corpse. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeping, Walker recalled the man with whom he had shared his life -- the way 
Falconer would bring out the fine china and the good crystal, even for an 
informal dinner for two, the way he would romp with their two Kerry blue 
terriers, the way he would goldbrick while Walker did all the gardening and 
then joke about how he had done such a nice job. 
</P>
<P>
 Falconer was such a lucky guy, he recalled, that the USC doctorate he finished 
this summer was paid for mostly by a windfall he had won at a Reno slot 
machine.  
</P>
<P>
 At St. James' school, Falconer's students alternated between sobs and 
laughter, remembering the puppets used by Falconer to coax the shy students 
into singing.  
</P>
<P>
 "You see stuff like this on TV, but you don't think it'll happen to someone 
you know," said 12-year-old Anne Collins. "What makes it so sad is, he died 
because someone wanted an object of his. . . . It just seems so pointless." 
</P>
<P>
 A requiem is scheduled Wednesday at 7 p.m. at St. James. Memorial donations 
may be made to the David John Falconer Scholarship Fund for Research in the  
</P>
<P>
 Kodaly Method, c/o the School of Music at USC.

FBI PROBES POSSIBLE HOSPITAL EMBEZZLING; HEALTH CARE: THE AGENCY AND UCLA 
MEDICAL CENTER AUDITORS ARE LOOKING INTO CLAIMS THAT A RADIOLOGY EMPLOYEE 
BILLED THE FACILITY FOR SERVICES THAT WERE NOT PERFORMED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The FBI and internal auditors at UCLA are investigating allegations that an 
employee in the department of radiological sciences embezzled funds by using 
outside companies to bill the UCLA Medical Center for services that were never 
performed, sources told The Times on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA issued a statement to The Times acknowledging an ongoing probe into 
"possible financial irregularities" but gave no details. "UCLA is determined to 
identify any illegal acts that may have been committed," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a subsequent interview, Chancellor Charles E. Young also said the 
investigation centers on the "potential misuses of funds." 
</P>
<P>
 But sources on Monday supplied additional details, saying that the FBI had 
interviewed radiology employees about allegations that an unidentified employee 
bilked the university by overcharging for temporary help through two outside 
registries in which he reportedly had a financial interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The radiological sciences department performs X-rays, bone scans, magnetic 
resonance imaging and other procedures for the UCLA Medical Center and, on rare 
occasions, for the West Los Angeles Veterans Administration Medical Center. It 
has an annual budget of $22 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The department -- as is common in medicine -- hires temporary non-physician 
employees through professional registries to help out during peak periods or to 
fill in when its employees call in sick or go on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the sources, the FBI and internal auditors are investigating 
allegations that a department employee used the names and Social Security 
numbers of registry employees to bill the university for hours they did not 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 The registries, said one of the sources, were "private companies . . . that 
may be owned by the target of the investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA officials said that Richard J. Steckel, acting chairman of the radiology 
department, has ordered a "full audit of the entire department" and that the 
"release of any additional information at this time could seriously compromise 
the effectiveness of the investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Edwin D. Pierce, director of UCLA's internal audit department, declined to 
discuss details of the investigation Monday, but said, "We're hoping we can get 
something in 60 to 90 days." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce said the probe is an offshoot of an internal audit that began last year 
in the radiological sciences department. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources familiar with the radiological sciences department said such units are 
usually profit centers at any hospital, but UCLA officials have been concerned 
that the department is not making as much money as it should. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Grant, radiology chief at the nearby VA hospital who also holds an 
appointment in radiology at UCLA, said Steckel has "brought in his own auditors 
and we're going to find out what was going on here. . . ."

COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR FINDS REFORM ELUSIVE; GOVERNMENT: HIRED SIX MONTHS AGO 
WITH A MANDATE TO CONTROL BUDGETS, SALLY REED HAS SUFFERED A STRING OF 
SETBACKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA and FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She was hired on her record as a no-nonsense fiscal conservative, someone who 
could finally impose restraints on a Los Angeles County government that at 
times seems out of control.  
</P>
<P>
 County operations needed a dose of bitter medicine, and the Board of 
Supervisors decided Sally Reed was the one to administer it. 
</P>
<P>
 What a difference six months make. Reed, tapped to be the county's chief 
administrative officer, has suffered a string of setbacks to her ambitious 
goals of controlling spending and remaking county government. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, the board abandoned Reed in her effort to curb spending by 
Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti when members agreed to increase his budget by $3.8 
million. A few weeks ago, the board took the rare action of drafting a set of 
budget guidelines for Reed to follow, which preempts some of the strategies she 
favored and disputes her fundamental assertion that the county is $900 million 
in the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed, who served as Santa Clara County's top manager for 12 years, said she 
knew coming in that it would be difficult to gain the support of a board that 
can be unpredictable in its alliances. But during a break from her budget 
preparations recently, Reed voiced frustration at her failure to win the votes 
of some supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did think the board would support the policies we put forward -- and then 
only deviate from them if they absolutely had to," she said. "Many of their 
positions are different than where I want to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Deane Dana, who has emerged as Reed's strongest ally, voiced 
concern about the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very, very sad and I'm very worried," Dana said. 
</P>
<P>
 He contends that Reed was given a mandate to straighten out the county's 
troubled finances, "but for some reason the majority of the board is not 
backing her up now. When you hire someone to do a job, you've got to follow 
through and let them do it. She must be very frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many observers at the Hall of Administration are perplexed by the turn of 
events and wonder why a candidate chosen with so much hope and fanfare only a 
few months ago can't seem to muster a three-vote majority to support key 
objectives. Depending on whom you talk to, Reed is the victim of a fickle board 
or of her own political naivete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she's definitely a smart, savvy person; she's not doing anything that 
she didn't do up in Santa Clara County," said Dan Savage, a spokesman for one 
of the county's largest unions, who has been watching Reed's budget actions and 
her relations with the board with keen interest. "But I think she had more 
leeway in policy matters in Santa Clara County. The board has definitely sent a 
shot across the bow that they intend to maintain control." 
</P>
<P>
 From the outset, Reed offered a vision and framework that would vastly alter 
the operations of county government. She quickly calculated that the county was 
running a $900-million deficit and asked department heads to submit budgets 
that were pared by an average of 36%. 
</P>
<P>
 She was not shy about charting an agenda: She would steer the county away from 
practices such as borrowing money and amassing a huge debt; she would begin to 
build up a contingency reserve; she would redirect the county's energies away 
from its reliance on the state to bail it out of its budget woes. 
</P>
<P>
 But some board members clearly were not ready to follow her lead. 
</P>
<P>
 * In February, the board adopted Reed's package of conservative budgeting 
principles, in which it agreed not to spend money it doesn't have, but only 
after Reed assured the board that it would not actually have to abide by the 
rules for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 * In March, Reed asked the board to adopt a hard-and-fast hiring freeze, in 
preparation for anticipated layoffs in the next budget year. But before the 
supervisors even voted on her proposal, they granted several departments 
exemptions and finally adopted a weaker plan that would allow thousands of jobs 
to be filled. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fresh from the job freeze battle, Reed asked the supervisors to stop signing 
long-term leases until the budget is adopted. But a majority voted to approve 
leases on new mental health department office space in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * Then, in an effort to have the new budget ready to go July 1, Reed 
recommended moving up budget deliberations by a month. That way, she reasoned, 
necessary cuts could be implemented as quickly as possible. The supervisors, 
however, voted to stick with their traditional timetable of July deliberations, 
after the beginning of the fiscal year and after the state budget is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Last month, the board sent its clearest signal yet that it is reluctant to 
follow Reed's budget lead when Supervisor Ed Edelman, supported by Supervisors 
Gloria Molina and Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, drafted a new set of budget 
guidelines. They asked department heads to come up with ways to generate new 
revenue.  
</P>
<P>
 * Two weeks ago, the board rendered its setback on Garcetti and also ignored 
Reed's recommendation to rethink a billion-dollar overhaul and expansion of Los 
Angeles County-USC Medical Center, approving an environmental impact report for 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman has taken the lead in opposing many of Reed's early policies. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is disappointed that Reed has not been more "fiscally creative" in 
dealing with the budget. He said he does not think she has adequately explored 
ways to generate new revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Disagreeing with Dana, Edelman contended that the only mandate given to Reed 
was to "follow the policies of the board, as directed by the board." 
</P>
<P>
 The chief administrative officer serves at the pleasure of the board but 
typically has been given broad powers to manage the county's $13-billion annual 
budget and 84,000-employee work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed joined the county last October on the heels of one of its greatest 
financial crises. Facing a $1.6-billion budget gap, the board last year was 
confronted with threats of employee walkouts and was forced to severely curtail 
health and social welfare programs and lay off several hundred workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed was expected shore up confidence in county government both inside and 
outside the Hall of Administration, while filling the void left by the forced 
resignation of former CAO Richard B. Dixon, who departed amid rising criticism 
over spending practices. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reed said that some board members and others may have gotten the wrong 
impression that she is only interested in cutting programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that I enjoy seeing programs reduced. I think county government has 
a mandate to do things far beyond what we have the budget for," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she added: "The problem I've always had is that I believe, in the end, we 
have to live with what we have." 
</P>
<P>
 One former senior county administrator said Reed has to learn the Golden Rule 
of county government: You can't do it your way, you've got to do it the board's 
way.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; BOLTON HIT 
ESSENTIALLY IS 1966 ISLEY SONG, JURY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal jury ruled Monday that Michael Bolton's "Love Is a Wonderful Thing" 
is essentially the same as a song of the same name released by the Isley 
Brothers in 1966.  
</P>
<P>
 The jury reached its decision after about 2 1/2 days of deliberations.Earlier 
Monday, the eight-member panel had announced that it was deadlocked, but U.S. 
District Judge Lourdes Baird ordered deliberations to continue. The jury will 
now decide damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury agreed with the Isleys and Three Boys Music Corp. that essential 
elements of the 1966 song, "Love Is a Wonderful Thing," were present in the 
Bolton song that helped sell 10 million copies of his 1991 "Time, Love and 
Tenderness" album. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Robert Sugarman, representing Bolton and the song's co-writer, Andrew 
Goldmark, had argued that the songs "look different and they sound different."

FOREST; DRIVER SHOT ON HIGHWAY; LAPD MECHANIC HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Pasadena man lost an eye Monday when a motorist stopped in front of his car 
on Angeles Crest Highway and allegedly shot him. Noel Milovic, 52, was in 
stable condition at Verdugo Hills Hospital, Sheriff's Lt. Jim Hays said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Shinkman, 52, a mechanic for the Los Angeles Police Department, was 
booked on suspicion of attempted murder and held without bail in the 1:15 p.m. 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victim was driving ahead of the suspect when Shinkman drove around him 
and then stopped, got out of his car pulled out a gun and fired four shots, one 
of them hitting the victim," Hays said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said two off-duty sheriff's deputies witnessed the incident and followed 
Shinkman to a service station in La Crescenta, where he was calling authorities 
to say he had shot a man. Deputies in another car called an ambulance.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; COAST GUARD 
HANDING OUT TICKETS FOR SMALL OIL SPILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Coast Guard is testing a program of handing out tickets when small oil 
spills occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil spills require a full-scale investigation by the Coast Guard, a procedure 
that can drag on before ending in hearings before an administrative officer. 
Hoping to speed up the process, the agency is launching a six-month test of 
issuing tickets in spills of 100 gallons or less in the port areas of Long 
Beach, Charleston, S.C., and Galveston, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 When a spill occurs and the violator is known, the investigating officer can 
issue a ticket immediately under the program. The violator will be able to pay 
a penalty to close the case within 30 days or request a hearing.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; JAIL 
EMPLOYEE AWARDED $1.2 MILLION FROM CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury awarded $1.2 million Monday to a jail employee who sued the city and 
two police officers in connection with a 1991 altercation outside police 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Jones, 43, and her attorney applauded the award, which came after a 
weeklong civil trial and a week of deliberations by a Superior Court jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're both very happy with the outcome," said attorney Charles J. Mazursky. 
"It was a long, hard fight for Jennifer Jones to get her name restored and her 
reputation vindicated." 
</P>
<P>
 On a 10-2 vote, the jury found the officers 80% at fault and Jones 20% at 
fault for the confrontation. Finding Jones partially at fault reduced her award 
from more than $1.4 million to $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, a civilian, claimed that she was accosted by the officers and struck in 
the legs with a baton for no reason as she trotted -- late for work -- across 
the police headquarters parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Michael Daly and former Officer John Puis told a different story, 
saying Jones became belligerent when they stopped her in the parking lot and 
asked her identity. They contend that Jones was hit with the baton only after 
she shoved one of them and struck the other in the forehead. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones denied that, saying she called out her name and ID number over her 
shoulder as she hurried across the parking lot, but said Daly was unsatisfied 
so he confronted her.

PANEL GIVES MAYOR'S BUDGET GOOD RECEPTION; FINANCES: BUT COUNCIL MEMBERS WANT 
MORE INFORMATION ON PLAN TO USE $200 MILLION IN DWP FUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council's first shot at Mayor Richard Riordan's inaugural 
budget was a gentle one, with a council committee praising the mayor's 
inventive financing to hire more police, but questioning whether it can be 
sustained in future years. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Zev Yaroslavsky and Ruth Galanter, sitting as the council's 
Budget and Finance Committee, said they are particularly concerned about an 
unprecedented transfer of nearly $200 million from the city Department of Water 
and Power to the municipal treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawmakers said they will press officials from the city utility to see 
whether they can sustain the transfer, about $75 million more than in past 
years, once onetime sales of assets such as fuel oil, property and surplus 
supplies have been exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to know if we can continue it," Galanter told Riordan -- who was 
making the first appearance by a mayor in memory before the council's budget 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a radical departure from the way business has been done in the past," 
Yaroslavsky said. "If they can defend it, it will pass. If they can't, we'll 
look for other revenues." 
</P>
<P>
 The expanded DWP transfer is a linchpin of the $4.3-billion Riordan budget 
that will be debated by the council for the next month. It provides about 
one-fifth of the money the mayor has proposed to balance the budget and to hire 
more police.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The first full day of budget hearings revealed no unexpected political or 
practical problems for the Riordan proposal, which would take effect in the 
fiscal year beginning July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and his aides said the proposed onetime windfall from the sale of DWP 
oil and other assets can be continued in future years. "Next year, it won't be 
selling fuel but a reduction in overhead and other costs," Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Mayor Mike Keeley suggested, for example, that the utility's fuel tanks 
can be leased to produce a continuing source of income. Overtime pay for DWP 
workers has already been cut to produce more savings. Other sources of cash 
will be rooted out in the coming year, the mayor's aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 Galanter and Yaroslavsky said they support the efforts, as long as the city 
utility's managers can guarantee that they will not drive up utility rates. 
That could cost the city electric customers as the state Public Utilities 
Commission is preparing to place public and private electric companies in 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 'If we blow all our efficiencies on transferring money over here to the City 
Hall, we could undermine our long-term interest in holding on to customers and 
supporting the utility," Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Budget and Finance Committee chairman also hinted that he may fight 
Riordan on another front: the mayor's call for the continuation of an increase 
in charges used to maintain garbage trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanitation equipment charge jumped two years ago from $36 to $72 annually 
for homeowners and from $18 to $36 for apartment dwellers, and would continue 
at the higher rate under the Riordan plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky noted that Riordan called for discontinuance of another tax -- 
this one a surcharge on business revenues -- that was imposed at the same time 
as the refuse fee. The councilman said the sanitation fee should also drop, if 
possible, because it was imposed at the same time as the business surcharge so 
that business people and residents "shared the burden" in balancing the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said he is open to negotiations but that cutting the business tax 
sends a more important message in attempting to sustain commerce in Los 
Angeles. "We have already taxed ourselves out of competition with others," 
Riordan said.

U.S. OFFICIALS DISSECT QUAKE RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal officials who gathered here Monday to discuss their effort to help 
Southern California recover from the Northridge earthquake praised themselves 
for responding rapidly and cohesively but stressed the need to improve on 
nearly every front. 
</P>
<P>
 Underlying their discussion was anxiety that the next challenge may be far 
tougher. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a great experience," William E. Clark of the Department of Health 
and Human Services said of the relief program. "But the Big One scares the 
bejesus out of us." He called the Jan. 17 temblor "not the Big One but the big 
warning." 
</P>
<P>
 For many of those who met for 3 1/2 hours in a hotel ballroom here, the 
devastating quake in a dense urban area represented high-pressure, on-the-job 
training less than a year after they took office. 
</P>
<P>
 One participant called the effort "the civil equivalent of Operation Desert 
Storm" -- without the benefit of six months of preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal, state and local officials and private relief agencies received high 
marks overall from James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, and from Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros, Transportation Secretary 
Federico F. Pena and other leaders of the federal response. "We established a 
new standard of performance," Pena said. 
</P>
<P>
 But others emphasized that the quake would have taken a far greater toll had 
it not occurred before dawn on a Monday morning, and on a holiday at that. And 
several speakers noted that a much more severe quake -- with projections of 
tens of thousands injured and up to $80 billion in damage -- could loom ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've come a long way, but we still have a long way to go to be ready," said 
Witt, who quarterbacked the federal relief effort and was host of Monday's 
symposium. 
</P>
<P>
 The participants said there is an urgent need for improved preparedness, 
training, coordination, communication, public education, and construction and 
safety measures to limit future injuries and damage.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the missteps that federal officials vowed to avoid in future calamities: 
</P>
<P>
 * Disaster assistance centers -- some of which opened only four days after the 
Northridge earthquake -- were initially plagued by long lines, slow processing, 
lack of bilingual staff and confusion over emergency housing programs provided 
by various federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * An early rash of false and inflated claims stemming from suspension of 
standard screening procedures in an emergency food stamp program that parceled 
out $68 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Repair costs for freeways damaged by the Jan. 17 temblor were overestimated 
-- by $500 million -- by California transportation officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt and Cisneros acknowledged that there was confusion about eligibility 
requirements for FEMA's short-term housing grants and HUD's 18-month rental 
vouchers for low-income victims. Cisneros said he will make disaster housing 
assistance available again but with some modifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Oleta G. Fitzgerald, executive assistant to Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, 
said a recent workshop held to assess problems with the emergency food stamp 
program determined that advanced planning with states is necessary to prevent 
fraud and that information about eligibility criteria and penalties for fraud 
should be circulated through the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials agreed that efforts should be intensified to construct and retrofit 
buildings to minimize damage in the future. They also called for establishment 
of a stable, long-term funding source to pay for disaster relief.

BOTTLE BATTLE; BEVERAGE CONTAINER PROVES A COOL WAY TO FEND OFF GUNMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Given his choice of weapons, Charles Wesley would rather arm himself with a 
pistol than a bottle of Snapple every time. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunday night, when he hurled the bottle at a man with a gun, the 
restaurant manager in Calabasas found that a well-aimed lemon-flavored iced tea 
can do the job quite nicely. 
</P>
<P>
 From about 15 feet away, Wesley hit the masked man, who was dressed in black 
like a ninja, in the face with the bottle. That gave Wesley enough time to 
flee, dodging bullets on the way, said Lt. Michael Moore of the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I beat him to the draw," said Wesley, a soft-spoken Brooklyn native 
whose wife is five months pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was actually Wesley's second crime-fighting adventure. In 1982, 
he tackled a man who had robbed a woman at knifepoint outside a Panorama City 
supermarket, for which he was honored by the mayor, the police chief and the 
Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's incident started about 12:15 a.m. when Wesley, 31, was locking up at 
the Red Robin restaurant on Calabasas Road and heading home, Moore said. As 
Wesley walked to his car, he saw a man jump into shrubbery at the edge of the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Wesley said he thought he had stumbled upon someone relieving himself. He 
tried to startle the man and yelled at him to come out. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy jumps out in this all black, ninja-type outfit, wearing a ski mask 
and has this gun pointed at me," Wesley said. "I thought he was going to kill 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 The man, who was kneeling in a firing position, told Wesley to freeze, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Wesley reached into a pocket for the iced tea he had planned to drink 
on the way home and threw it at the man. "I was very lucky to hit him," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wesley said he ran, taking cover first behind a wall and then running in a 
zigzag to avoid the bullets the man was firing at him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the man shot and missed three times before he escaped by driving away 
in a black Cadillac or Monte Carlo, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't recommend this type of thing," Moore said of the bottle-throwing. 
"But in this case, it did work . . . and no one got hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 When Wesley detained the armed robber 12 years ago, he won citations and 
commendations from some of the city's most powerful people. This time, all he 
got was a couple of days off. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he believes he did the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was going to rob me, then kill me," he said. "My wife's birthday 
is in two days and I didn't want to miss it."

LAPD SECRECY ON STREET CRIME DATA TRIGGERS CONTROVERSY; POLICE: YAROSLAVSKY TO 
CALL FOR RELEASE OF VIOLENT-CRIME ANALYSES. THE MATERIAL INCLUDES PLANS FOR 
STYMIEING LAWBREAKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A decision by the Los Angeles Police Department to keep confidential extensive 
analyses of street crime has prompted concern from some community leaders and 
elected officials who want to see the documents -- no matter how ugly their 
findings may seem. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said he will introduce a motion at the City Council 
meeting today calling on the LAPD to release its crime reviews despite concern 
that so doing could cause public anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 "It flies in the face of community-based policing to withhold from the public 
the very type of information it needs to police itself," Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 The violent-crime analyses, issued every few months, are created from reports 
submitted by the LAPD's 18 geographical divisions. They contain a statistical 
look at the worst crime hot-spots, an analysis of underlying causes and an 
action plan to stymie those who break the law, police sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the LAPD is refusing to release the reports to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office rejected a Freedom of Information Act request for 
the documents. Police Chief Willie L. Williams refused to discuss the report 
Monday night, referring questions to the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 But Assistant Chief Bernard Parks, who is compiling the reports, said in an 
interview Monday that he views them as internal working documents aimed at 
improving crime-fighting by the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like our getting ready for the World Cup," he said. "We don't 
publicize that. We don't publicize our getting ready for the end of a trial. We 
don't publicize operational reports." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, he had said that release of the information would pit neighborhoods 
against neighborhoods and prompt council members to call for changes in 
deployment strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 Some community leaders insisted Monday that they want the facts so they will 
have a realistic view of the neighborhoods where they live. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why hide the truth from us?" asked Frank Villalobos of Barrio Planners, an 
Eastside group. "We want to know what's really going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction on the Los Angeles City Council was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Laura Chick said she wants police officials to appear before the 
council's Public Safety Committee next month to justify why the reports ought 
to remain secret. If the answer is not good enough, she said she will call for 
the information to be released. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not calling for immediate disclosure, but I am not convinced yet that 
this crime information is confidential," Chick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky went further by calling for immediate release of the information. 
He said all statistical information in the reports could be released without 
affecting LAPD operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the spirit of open government, this information must be made public," he 
said. "The citizens of Los Angeles should not and must not be denied this 
information." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Marvin Braude, on the other hand, sided with the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think public safety has a higher priority than the need to know," Braude 
said. "I'm ready to move in the direction of public safety -- to erode some 
individual rights to protect public safety." 
</P>
<P>
 The department already compiles comprehensive crime statistics from 
neighborhoods across the city, information that is available to the public. But 
that raw data is analyzed and coupled with commentary in the reports on 
contributing factors -- such as the number of liquor stores, parolees and 
homeless people in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Also included in the reports are LAPD strategies for combatting the crime -- 
special patrols, abatement programs and other crime-fighting mechanisms. 
"That's something we would consider very sensitive," said one LAPD official 
familiar with the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan said he has not taken a position on whether the 
information ought to be released. "The answer should be obvious -- people 
should know," he said. "But I'm worried about people drawing unfair conclusions 
from this." 
</P>
<P>
 Jaeis Chon, who participates in a crime patrol in the Koreatown area, was 
equally undecided. The hard facts might damage the reputations of some 
communities, he said. But the information might prompt more people into action 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hoped the Williams Administration would change the mentality that the LAPD 
is in a world of its own," said Karen Bass, who is leading the campaign against 
the concentration of liquor stores in South-Central Los Angeles. "The police 
and the community both need to review that data."

FOE TEED OFF BY PROPOSED GOLF FEE HIKE

 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan proposes in his new budget that golfers at 
municipal courses pay $1 more a round. The charge, a mayoral deputy says, is 
part of making the city "more entrepreneurial." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's leading golf gadfly calls it something else. "It's a tax," said 
Marty Tregnan, president of the Los Angeles Municipal Golf Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Tregnan contends that the charge, although nominal, violates Riordan's 
campaign pledge of no new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's chief of staff, Bill McCarley, denies it, saying the mayor has never 
opposed "fees for services that are not unreasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 The higher charges -- from $15 to $16 a round during the week and $19.50 to 
$20.50 on weekends -- were proposed by Recreation and Parks Department staff to 
keep pace with county golf fees, which stand at $17 on weekdays and $21 on 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Riordan budget embraces the staff recommendation, suggesting it will bring 
an additional $1 million a year into the $4.3-billion city budget. "We didn't 
have a big problem with the increase. We didn't think it was out of line," 
McCarley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tregnan said he and other golfers will turn up at City Hall in June when the 
proposal goes before the Recreation and Parks Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a time of recession, we are already seeing not as many people playing 
tournaments," Tregnan said. "Every time you raise the fees, some people have to 
decide whether they are going to keep playing or not." JAMES RAINEY

DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER OR A MUTUAL FUND BY ITS NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anytime you're looking at mutual fund investments, Shakespeare's question 
"what's in a name?" should never be too far from your mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Updated for the 1994 marketplace, the message might read, "Never assume that a 
fund operates on the philosophy that its name seems to imply." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund, a $1-billion fund with an 
impeccable pedigree and high marks from independent advisory services -- but 
also a portfolio that really stretches the definition of "blue chip." 
</P>
<P>
 The fund's recent investments have included such large, long-established 
enterprises as Ford Motor, Texas Instruments, Whirlpool and Deere. 
</P>
<P>
 But the list also bristles with names like Hornbeck Offshore Services, 
Informix and Mirage Resorts Inc., none of which will be candidates for the next 
vacancy in the Dow Jones industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
 When Michael Gordon took over as the fund's manager last year, "he immediately 
started buying small- and medium-cap stocks," reports analyst Amy Arnott in the 
Morningstar Mutual Funds advisory service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given Gordon's past record at Fidelity, this fund has a good shot at 
sustaining its success," Arnott added. "It's important for shareholders to 
realize that this is far from a traditional blue-chip offering, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Or look at Blue Chip's sister fund, the Fidelity Dividend Growth Fund, which 
started operations about a year ago with Abigail Johnson at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
 It got off to a promising start toward its stated objective of "capital 
appreciation." But dividends? So far it has paid out precisely a penny a share 
in dividend distributions, which works out to a yield of less than 0.01%. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund's largest single stock holding at last report, Home Shopping Network, 
has been a popular growth stock but has never paid a cash dividend. The 
Fidelity group, the giant of the fund business at nearly twice the size of its 
nearest rival, is known for giving individual fund managers wide latitude. But 
it isn't the only place where names don't always fit. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the Warburg Pincus Growth & Income Fund, which has been attracting a 
lot of attention and above-average performance ratings from Morningstar and the 
Value Line Mutual Fund Survey since Anthony Orphanos became its manager in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "It returned over 37% last year, making it one of the best-performing funds in 
the growth and income group," Value Line reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrific growth. But income? The reported dividend payout in the last year of 
12 cents a share works out to a yield of less than 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund-name misunderstandings can occur just as commonly in the realm of 
fixed-income investing. In recent years, for instance, it has become painfully 
clear that a "government securities" fund can hold anything from ultra-safe 
Treasury bills to bits and pieces of mortgage debt that qualify as some of the 
most speculative bets anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Or take the phrase capital preservation, which crops up now and then in fund 
names. 
</P>
<P>
 Benham Management Corp. in Mountain View, Calif., runs the Capital 
Preservation Fund and Capital Preservation Fund II, both money market funds 
with an emphatic safety-first philosophy. Money funds seek to maintain constant 
net asset values so that their shareholders experience neither capital gains 
nor losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Keystone America Capital Preservation & Income Fund II, by contrast, seeks 
"current income with low volatility of principal," investing mainly in 
adjustable-rate mortgage securities. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Morningstar, the fund's net asset value dropped from $10.07 at 
the end of 1991 to $9.82 a year later, before recovering to $9.87 by the end of 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 performance "shows that it learned its 1992 lesson well," says 
Morningstar analyst Erik Laughlin. "The fund suffered relatively big capital 
losses in 1992 as a result of its willingness to dabble in such risky 
derivative securities as interest-only strips." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Laughlin reports, the fund has "dumped its derivatives."

THERE'S MORE TO A MUTUAL FUND THAN A GOOD MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In recent years, mutual fund managers have taken on celebrity status among 
investors. But a recent study questions whether fund managers actually matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The most obvious example of a celebrity fund manager is Peter Lynch, who 
managed Fidelity's giant Magellan Fund for 13 years before his retirement in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, Lynch remains a familiar fixture in the financial press. Other 
managers, such as Michael Price of Mutual Shares, Carlene Murphy and Dick Weiss 
of Strong Common Stock, Jim Craig of Janus Fund, John Neff of Vanguard Windsor 
and more recently Jim Crabbe of the Crabbe-Huson Special Fund are well-known to 
investors who follow their exploits in the financial press. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, their funds have drawn so much attention and money that the 
managers have been forced to close their doors to new investors. Others have 
kept their doors open, however, and investors are pouring money into them as 
quickly as they can come up with the cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for the funds' popularity is simple: Over the years, their managers 
have gotten results. Their funds have consistently ranked high in the 
performance tables investors read in the press. So it stands to reason that 
investors want these pros managing their money. 
</P>
<P>
 But what happens when a hotshot manager leaves his or her fund? 
</P>
<P>
 Many shareholders immediately dump their fund holdings and move on in search 
of another celebrity manager -- or follow the old manager to a new fund. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, that proves a wise decision: For example, when Murphy and Weiss 
left SteinRoe Special in 1991 to take over Strong Common Stock, they took their 
magic touch with them. Their new fund has posted a 117% gain since the March, 
1991, manager change, versus a 39% gain for the S&P 500. Meanwhile, SteinRoe 
Special has posted a 58% gain. 
</P>
<P>
 But what about shareholders who deserted the Magellan Fund when it lost Peter 
Lynch? Too bad for them. The fund has since gained 78%, versus a 45% return for 
the S&P 500. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you know when a manager's departure will matter? According to Sheldon 
Jacobs, editor of the No-Load Fund Investor ((914) 693-7420), you should 
consider the size of the fund family's research staff. Jacobs maintains that a 
star portfolio manager is generally much more important in a small organization 
than in a larger one. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, much of Lynch's performance at Magellan may have reflected the 
talents of the huge research team that Fidelity maintains. When Lynch left, 
that organization was available to his successors. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs backs up his claim with a study of fund manager turnover at Fidelity, 
where there have been roughly 50 portfolio manager changes in the past two 
years. He found that the median Fidelity equity manager has been running his or 
her current fund for only 15 months. Yet Fidelity's fund performance has been 
excellent during recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs attributes those results to the depth of the Fidelity organization, 
which includes 75 equity research analysts, 50 fixed-income research analysts 
and hordes of assistant analysts, traders and the like -- not to mention a huge 
team of portfolio managers who trade ideas among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Jacobs points out that funds at other large organizations such as T. 
Rowe Price have lost star managers with no measurable results. By contrast, a 
fund that cannot rely on a strong research organization department is likely to 
suffer when a star departs. 
</P>
<P>
 Conclusion: A good manager may be important, but a strong fund organization 
might matter even more in the long run.

EXPERTS URGE AMERICANS TO SAVE MORE FOR RETIREMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHET CURRIER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you think you've been hearing a lot lately about retirement saving, just 
wait a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the direction current economic, political and population trends are 
taking, the "retirement crisis" is likely to become a bigger issue in this 
country in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless we as a society save more and do a better job of investing, future 
retirees face a drastically reduced standard of living," says Eli Broad, 
chairman and chief executive of SunAmerica Inc., a Los Angeles financial 
services firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a crisis facing us both individually and as a society. It affects 
everyone, since we could all be forced to pay higher taxes to cover the 
millions of Americans who failed to plan ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Daniel Tully, chairman and chief executive of Merrill Lynch & Co., 
points to "the critical need for increased personal saving in the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
 Declares Tully in the Wall Street firm's just-published annual report: "Our 
study reveals that the low U.S. savings rate could leave 46 million members of 
the baby-boom generation with retirement living standards lower than today's 
retirees." 
</P>
<P>
 Executives like these aren't exactly impartial observers. They and their 
companies stand to make a lot of money from a surge in retirement saving. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad frankly describes the prospect as "one of the great growth industries of 
the future." After having made his first fortune in the home-building business, 
he has in recent years realigned his business to concentrate entirely on 
selling retirement savings products such as annuities. 
</P>
<P>
 And SunAmerica's stock has soared from $3.37 a share in 1990 to as high as 
$46.50 in late 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 So there is surely some element of salesperson's zeal in all this. At the same 
time, however, the hype seems to be pretty well grounded in reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are living a lot longer, which means they have got to provide for a 
much longer retirement," Broad said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, as changes evolve in the nation's Social Security and 
private pension systems, "retirement saving is becoming a do-it-yourself 
proposition," he observed. 
</P>
<P>
 The subject can be daunting. Financial planners report they frequently see 
their customers' faces go blank when they are confronted with it. 
</P>
<P>
 But these advisers point out that it isn't a problem that has to be mastered 
all at once. The most important advice for many people, they say, is simply not 
to procrastinate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stop believing that because your income and assets may be limited, you can't 
do any financial planning," says Jonathan Pond, a financial planner in 
Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basic financial planning matters such as insurance, saving, planning for 
retirement and preparing estate planning documents apply to everyone, 
regardless of net worth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of what you do in your year-to-year financial planning is directly or 
indirectly geared toward assuring you a comfortable retirement," Pond adds. 
"Yet many people still fall short. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how young or old you are, don't delay projecting your retirement 
needs and planning to meet them. Take advantage of the many tax-deferred 
retirement-earmarked savings plans available" such as individual retirement 
accounts, company-sponsored 401(k) plans, or even U.S. savings bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pond's view, "it is inexcusable not to save at least 10% of your gross 
income, no matter what your circumstances. If you say you can't do it, you 
haven't looked hard enough at how you spend your money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless you inherit it or marry it, you will never accumulate enough money to 
achieve retirement security without saving regularly."

 Attorneys, appraisers, real estate agents and residents living near major 
power lines in the San Fernando Valley and Ventura County are watching to see 
the outcome of a trial under way in Orange County Superior Court in which a 
group of homeowners are claiming that their property rights have been 
compromised because of upgraded power lines next to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs went to trial this month demanding that San Diego Gas & 
Electric Co. buy their homes and pay the 1990 market price for them -- 1990 was 
the year when power lines near their properties had more power added to them. 
The utility sees this as an attempt by homeowners who have seen the market 
plummet to tap into the deep pockets of the utility. 
</P>
<P>
 This case -- and several others like it throughout the country -- points to a 
growing debate about the health and economic effects of electromagnetic field 
energy, also known as EMF. Until recently, neighbors have been mostly concerned 
about the aesthetics of towers nearby -- sometimes reaching 90 feet high -- or 
an unattended electrical station. But medical researchers and scientists now 
report that we may be harmed by long exposure to a wide range of electrical 
sources, from small appliances like a fan to major transmission lines. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the recent studies are conclusive, but children and the elderly who 
are exposed to elevated levels of EMF may be at an increased risk for brain 
cancer and leukemia. Scientists have shown that EMF can alter basic cellular 
functions and may possibly interfere with workings of the human immune system. 
Pregnant women may also be at increased risk of miscarriage. 
</P>
<P>
 The new concerns over possible health hazards are prompting a growing number 
of homeowners and home buyers to learn more about electromagnetic fields and 
their affect on health and home values. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be fewer people interested in a property adjacent to a power 
line," said Howard D. Greenberg of Tri-Valley Appraisal Services in Woodland 
Hills. "It's not an adverse condition per se," said Greenberg, but he still 
discloses proximity to a power line both to would-be lenders and buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a topic that is so sensitive now," said Kathy Mehringer, vice president 
and regional sales manager at Fred Sands Realtors in Westlake Village. "I don't 
think there is a standard of practice for the real estate industry on this 
issue yet." In fact, the California Department of Real Estate's Environmental 
Hazards guide for homeowners and buyers doesn't even mention EMF, she said. But 
according to state law, whenever a property enters escrow, the seller must 
disclose defects and hazards to a would-be buyer, but it is still uncommon for 
EMF information to be listed. 
</P>
<P>
 While Mehringer cannot recall a transaction at her company that was adversely 
affected by the existence of power lines on or near a property for sale, she 
said she could imagine just such a thing happening. She isn't certain if nearby 
power lines really have an effect on property values, though. "If I am a buyer 
and I am concerned about EMF, I would probably choose not to buy a particular 
property instead of just seeking a lower purchase price." 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl McCartin, one of the Orange County homeowners suing San Diego Gas & 
Electric, is convinced that upgraded power lines have diminished the value of 
her property. The McCartins purchased their home in 1988 for $730,000. For 18 
months, McCartin tried to sell her home (the latest asking price was $700,000), 
but didn't get one offer. "We've been trying to sell our home and we can't sell 
it," McCartin said. What she did get were comments from realtors and potential 
buyers about the power lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the time that the McCartins bought their home, power lines on 
45-foot-tall towers on an adjacent parcel of land were generating 12,000 volts 
each. In 1990, the local utility company upgraded the lines by adding another 
12,000-volt circuit, although the towers remained the same height. The 
McCartins filed suit in November, 1992, claiming that the magnetic fields 
coming from the power lines are a direct intrusion on their property or, to use 
the legal jargon, they claimed an "inverse condemnation" and an 
unconstitutional taking of their property without just compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 The McCartins and their neighbors want the court to issue an injunction 
requiring the utility to buy their homes for the fair market value as of the 
date the upgraded power lines were installed in July, 1990. This would be 
substantially more money than sellers could get in today's more deflated 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Utility companies locally and throughout the country are understandably 
worried about what happens if the McCartins succeed in their court case. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will always be a certain percentage of people who don't want to live 
near a power line, but that doesn't mean the property values will be 
diminished," said Mike Poizner, principal real estate officer at the Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power. "Right now, we don't have hard market 
data showing that buyers pay less for property near a power line." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he said, when the McCartins bought their home in 1988, there already 
was a very noticeable power line there. "It seems they weren't that concerned 
when they bought in the first place," Poizner said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles area, Poizner said, the DWP has done very little upgrading 
of power lines in the past few years. "Each time we have updated power lines, 
we have tried to not increase the amount of EMF." That, he said, is done by 
employing new technology and getting different electromagnetic fields to sort 
of cancel each other out. 
</P>
<P>
 John Tinker, senior counsel for Southern California Edison Co., thinks that 
the new trend of seeking property-related compensation from utility companies 
has more to do with the depressed real estate market than science or real 
concern among residents near power lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Southern California real estate market is such that a lot of people are 
trying to find a reason their homes aren't selling," he said. "They're looking 
for someone to help compensate them for the drop in market values." 
</P>
<P>
 While the DWP and Edison both say they haven't been sued because of 
property-related claims stemming from the EMF debate, such lawsuits are not far 
off, predicted Louis Slesin, editor of Microwave News, a bimonthly newsletter 
based in New York City that chronicles the EMF controversy for its 1,000 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been tracking EMF for 15 years, and clearly there is an effect on 
property values," Slesin said. "People sometimes can't get agents to even show 
a home in the vicinity of a power line. This is going to be more and more 
tested in the courts." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While scientists debate the seriousness of EMF as a health hazard, Slesin 
said, attorneys and homeowners will increasingly seek to stop new and expanded 
power lines with lawsuits such as the McCartins. "Residents are discovering 
that they don't need to argue the health issue," he said. "They can more easily 
litigate the issue of property values." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who are concerned about levels of EMF can have their home checked 
out room by room for free. 
</P>
<P>
 The number to call for information or to schedule an appointment for DWP 
customers is (800) DIAL-DWP. Edison customers can call (818) 812-7380.

VENTURA CITY MANAGER BAKER TO RESIGN JULY 1; GOVERNMENT: IN A SURPRISE 
ANNOUNCEMENT, HE SAYS HE WILL STEP DOWN AFTER 13 YEARS FOR A PRIVATE CONSULTING 
JOB. 
</P>

<P>
 Veteran Ventura City Manager John Baker announced his resignation Monday 
evening, soon after notifying the City Council of his surprise decision to step 
down after 13 years and move into a private consulting practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation is effective July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made the decision after months of deliberating and agonizing," Baker said 
at the evening council meeting. "It is a time in my life when my wife and 
children are less dependent on me, and I can make that kind of a move." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker, 50, distributed a resignation letter to the council in a closed session 
shortly before the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 He thanked council members, past and present, "for the support, guidance and 
friendship that has been there for the last 13 years." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Baker said he would do "trouble-shooting and consulting" with 
an old friend he once worked with in Oakland. "I'm going to solve everybody's 
problems," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker said he's been thinking of leaving city government off and on for six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Buford publicly thanked Baker for his service to the city. The mayor 
said in an interview that he did not think that divisiveness on the council in 
recent years contributed to Baker's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that having a council that's still trying to find its way would 
be a problem for someone with John's experience," the mayor said. "That's part 
of his job, to deal with a contentious council. I'm sure he's had to deal with 
worse than us." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker's wife, Catherine, said her husband had been seriously considering a 
career change for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was feeling that he had been in Ventura for quite a while and the change 
would be good," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of Baker -- known for his tight fiscal management and ramrod straight 
demeanor -- will be a blow to the city, several former council members said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very sorry for the city," said former Councilman John McWherter, who 
helped hire him in 1981. "They are going to lose one of the best managers that 
the city ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 McWherter said Baker, a retired Navy officer, has a mind "like a computer" 
that helped pull the city through difficult financial times. He also made sure 
that the city staff followed though on City Council direction, McWherter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Councilman Todd Collart, who worked with Baker from 1989 to 1993, said 
Baker was a master in dealing with "shrinking city budgets and conflicting 
demands from the public, Sacramento and Washington. He didn't enter office at 
an ideal time. That was a tough period and he did very well by the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Collart said Baker's decision to leave was probably prompted in part by 
increased tensions on the City Council, which has been sharply divided on 
growth issues for 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the council makeup changed, and there were greater differences of opinion, 
his job became more of a challenge," Collart said. "He had to respect what the 
council told him to do. And if you have seven people telling you the same 
thing, that's different than if you have four telling you one thing and three 
telling you another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then it's much more difficult to do a professional job of managing the city," 
Collart said. "It certainly had an effect. It wears you down. But I doubt if 
that was the deciding factor for him. He was a real professional and a tough, 
energetic person." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Mayor Richard Francis, who worked with Baker from 1987 to 1991, lauded 
him not only for his budget expertise but also for developing a coherent 
rationing plan during the six-year drought. 
</P>
<P>
 And Baker "worked well with a variety of difficult personalities," Francis 
said. "A lot of (elected) officials tend to be egotistical." 
</P>
<P>
 As a Navy officer, Baker served on the carrier Midway at the height of the 
Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 After returning from Vietnam in 1972, he worked his way up the ranks of 
Oakland's civil In an interview two weeks ago, Baker told The Times that he 
questioned why after so many years he was still working as city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has always worked in the public sector and had not really 
questioned his role. 
</P>
<P>
 His father was the mayor of a small town in Idaho, and he thought that was 
part of the reason he went into public service and stayed so long. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that when he got out of the Navy, he tried to find other jobs in the 
private sector, but employers said his military service and his degrees 
qualified him more for government work.

SATTIEWHITE DEATH SENTENCE IS UPHELD; COURTS: JUDGE LAWRENCE STORCH REJECTS 
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS' REQUEST FOR A LIFE TERM WITHOUT PAROLE FOR THE CONVICTED 
MURDERER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A convicted Oxnard murderer was sentenced Monday to die in the gas chamber by 
a judge whom the Ventura County district attorney's office described as overly 
lenient last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch's decision upholds a verdict of death for 
Christopher James Sattiewhite, 24, who shot 30-year-old Genoveva Gonzales in 
the head three times Jan. 26, 1992, and left her body in a drainage ditch along 
Arnold Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's sentencing was closely watched by district attorney's officials 
because Sattiewhite's lawyers had requested that Storch throw out the jury's 
recommended death sentence for Sattiewhite in favor of life in prison without 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 19, prosecutors began using a rare legal challenge to ban Storch from 
hearing any new criminal cases because he granted a defense attorney's request 
to alter the verdict in another murder case a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, Storch voided a first-degree murder conviction for Todd Love of 
Newbury Park and convicted him of second-degree murder, a lesser count. 
</P>
<P>
 Storch's decision shaved 10 years from the 25-year prison term that Love faced 
for killing his sister's boyfriend. And Storch added three years to Love's 
sentence for using a gun in the murder, instead of the five years sought by 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, however, Storch declined to spare Sattiewhite from the death 
sentence. The judge said he is confident that the evidence presented during the 
trial supports the jury's verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 20 years that I've been doing this, I have presided over many, many 
murder cases," Storch said, in delivering his ruling. "This is one of the most 
egregious I have seen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the Gonzales murder occurred after Sattiewhite 
inadvertently called out the name of an accomplice who had joined him in 
kidnaping and raping the victim. The killing was necessary to prevent the woman 
from identifying her assailants, according to court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the strong emotions he displayed when the jury returned a 
verdict of death against him March 28, Sattiewhite appeared unmoved by Storch's 
pronouncement. He even asked the court to ignore his attorney's request to 
delay the sentencing several weeks to further investigate a pre-sentence report 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to continue," Sattiewhite said, interrupting attorney Willard P. 
Wiksell, who was trying to ask for the delay. "I want to go. . . . I've been 
here too long. I'm ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Sattiewhite's mother watched her son's outburst from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy, shut up!" Margaret Sattiewhite admonished her son. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Margaret Sattiewhite expressed disappointment in both the decisions 
of the judge and the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was unjust," she said, tears welling up in her eyes. "I feel bad 
at this point. It's just unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, she criticized the fact that there were no blacks on the jury. 
Sattiewhite is black. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel if it was a white man, justice would have been done better," Margaret 
Sattiewhite told reporters. "There was no blacks on the panel. It should have 
been moved" to another county. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys in the case said two blacks were among the large group of people 
from which 12 jurors were selected. One of those prospective jurors asked to be 
excused for hardship reasons. The other was excluded by prosecutors, who aren't 
required by state law to explain why they disqualify a juror. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the motion to give Sattiewhite life in prison, Storch also 
denied a defense motion for a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys requested the new trial because a probation report revealed 
for the first time that the 69-year-old mother of victim Genoveva Gonzales 
opposes the death penalty and told authorities that she did not believe 
Sattiewhite should face death. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiksell accused the prosecution of deception for not telling the jury of the 
mother's wishes before the panel deliberated. Wiksell said that information 
"makes it more likely than not that a different verdict would have been given." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn called that information irrelevant, saying 
a philosophical viewpoint of a relative is immaterial to the facts of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Storch agreed with Glynn, saying the jury was never led to believe that 
Gonzales' mother wanted vengeance for her daughter's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiksell then argued for Storch to use his authority as judge to overrule the 
jury's recommendation and send Sattiewhite to prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorney repeated arguments he made during the trial that 
Sattiewhite has brain damage and was abused by his father as a child. 
</P>
<P>
 "While it is a bad crime," he said of Gonzales' death, "I don't think one can 
say . . . that this is the most shocking murder to ever hit Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn told the judge that Sattiewhite is much more intelligent than his 
attorneys acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although he is scholastically no higher than a 12-year-old, he's certainly 
street smart," Glynn said. "The death penalty was appropriate, and I would ask 
that the court leave the death penalty intact." 
</P>
<P>
 Storch said he was particularly influenced by two facts that came out during 
the trial. One is that Sattiewhite and two other men had raped a young woman on 
the Oxnard Shores Beach several months before Gonzales' death, while forcing 
the rape victim's boyfriend to watch at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 The second is that after Gonzales was raped and shot, Sattiewhite and his 
accomplices went to a restaurant. They ate a meal, seemingly undisturbed by the 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court has not heard any remorse from the defendant," Storch said.

OXNARD OFFICER FATALLY SHOOTS SUSPECT; CRIME: VAN NUYS MAN WAS HIT FOUR TIMES. 
POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING WHETHER HE FIRED DURING THE FOOT CHASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A rookie Oxnard police officer fatally shot a suspected car thief after a foot 
chase early Monday through yards and over fences in a quiet residential 
neighborhood, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Patrick Dolan, who joined the department nine months ago, fired 
several shots from his 9-millimeter Beretta at Alfonso Bravo, 20, of Van Nuys, 
authorities said. Bravo, who was reportedly armed with a large-caliber handgun, 
was struck by bullets in the back and side, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Chief Deputy Coroner Jim Wingate said Bravo was struck four 
times and died of multiple gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they were investigating whether Bravo fired at Dolan during the 
foot chase. Dolan, 29, was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident marks the fourth time in about six months that Oxnard police 
officers have been involved in a fatal shooting. Two of the three others have 
been called justified by the Ventura County district attorney's office, and the 
third is still being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the chase began about 1:30 a.m. as a routine traffic stop on 
Victoria Avenue north of Channel Islands Boulevard. Dolan attempted to pull 
over a 1988 dark blue Mustang for a traffic violation. The driver refused to 
stop and, after checking with dispatchers, Dolan was told that the car was 
reported stolen from Hollywood last week, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolan followed the car a few blocks north and onto Wooley Road, where Bravo 
crashed it into a block wall in the 3200 block, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bravo bolted out of the car and took off on foot, with Dolan in pursuit, 
police said. The pair scrambled over several fences in the residential 
neighborhood and, a few minutes later, in the 3200 block of Taffrail Lane, 
Dolan shot Bravo, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A fully loaded 9-millimeter Taurus was found near the victim at the scene, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cady said the safety mechanism on the gun was released and the gun was cocked. 
"If the guy didn't fire a shot, he was getting ready to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an initial interview with investigators, Dolan told detectives that he saw 
the suspect's gun during the foot chase but did not believe that the suspect 
had fired at him, Cady said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators estimated that Dolan was no more than 10 yards away from the 
suspect when he fired, Cady said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of a shooting incident, the officer has the power to protect himself 
from deadly force," Cady said. "The officer has to perceive a threat." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said they woke to the sounds of shouting and feet running down their 
normally quiet street, followed by shots. Some residents said they glimpsed 
police through their curtains but did not see the man officers were chasing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard lots of yelling, and then I heard firecrackers, or I guess they were 
shots," said Jamie Jackson, who lives on Taffrail. 
</P>
<P>
 One man, who asked that his name not be used, said he called 911 after hearing 
gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were right here, in my driveway," he said. "Shouting and yelling." 
</P>
<P>
 Told that police were already on the scene, the man and his family huddled on 
the floor inside the house in case stray bullets came through the windows. He 
said he thought that he heard someone climbing over his fence -- a wooden 
structure roughly seven feet high -- after the shots were fired. The suspected 
car thief died in the front yard after paramedics failed to resuscitate him, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thank God he didn't jump through the window," the resident said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday morning, the resident was in his front yard, cleaning up a few 
traces of blood and repairing a floodlight that illuminates his driveway. He 
said police told him that they broke it deliberately during the chase so that 
the fleeing man would not be able to see the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he heard shouts from the police, the resident said he saw no sign 
that the suspected car thief was willing to surrender.  
</P>
<P>
 "At no time did he yell that he gave up," the man said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Dolan has been placed on paid administrative leave during the 
initial investigation. The district attorney's office will also conduct an 
investigation and decide whether to prosecute Dolan in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief interview Monday, Dolan said it was the first time in his career 
that he had been involved in a shooting, but declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Charles Dunham, who is helping investigate the shooting for the Police 
Department, said Oxnard police officers have been involved in an unusually high 
number of shootings the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of guns out there," Dunham said. "The criminals are carrying 
more guns now during the commission of a crime."

COUNTING THE COSTS; PANEL WEIGHS COUNTYWIDE SALES TAX FOR TRANSPORTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with the soaring cost of Metrolink and other transit and road projects, 
the Ventura County Transportation Commission is considering taking the first 
steps toward putting a half-cent sales tax on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a request made by the commission earlier this month, staff members 
compiled a list of recommendations to raise money for transportation projects. 
Leading the list is a proposal to hire a consultant to study whether residents 
would vote to tax themselves to pay for buses, trains and road repair. 
</P>
<P>
 The move comes four years after voters overwhelmingly defeated Measure A -- a 
similar ballot initiative that would have raised $500 million for 
transportation projects over a 20-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 But transit leaders say that without the tax or some other new funding source, 
Metrolink service could be cut back, and the county and its 10 cities will see 
costs escalate as funding for street repairs and local bus service continues to 
shrink. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginger Gherardi, executive director of the commission, spelled out the problem 
in a written report presented Monday at a meeting of traffic engineers and 
other public works staff from the county and the 10 cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, we are facing these problems because we are the only urbanized 
county without a local half-cent sales tax for transportation," Gherardi wrote. 
The commission staff "believes that despite the political climate, the economy 
and other issues, we have to deal with the funding issue this year." 
</P>
<P>
 In November, California voters passed Proposition 172, a statewide extension 
of a half-cent sales tax to subsidize crime-fighting services. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, the tax passed by a margin of 58.1% to 48.9%, keeping the 
county's sales tax at 7.25%. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County is the largest county in California that does not collect a 
transportation sales tax, and the only county in Southern California without 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 A half-cent sales tax would add $25 million to the transportation commission's 
annual $64-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 If passed, the tax would help the county capture even more money through state 
and federal programs that require local matching funds, Gherardi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission at its May 8 meeting will consider paying a consultant $30,000 
to gauge whether residents would vote for the transportation tax. The money for 
the consultant would come out of the commission's professional services budget, 
according to the report presented Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 If the study is approved, it would be conducted during May, and the commission 
would decide at its June 3 meeting whether to put the measure on the fall 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 As in 1990, the campaign, which would cost an estimated $400,000, could be 
funded by businesses seeking ways to comply with federal regulations to improve 
public transit and reduce air pollution, Gherardi wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The last campaign received strong support from the Ventura County Economic 
Development Assn. Marc Charney, association president, said the group will wait 
until the commission reaches a decision before deciding whether to support the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 One commissioner, Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo, said he opposes 
placing the measure on the November ballot because there is not enough time to 
prepare a solid campaign to win over voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went through this once before, and it was a big rush job and it didn't 
work," Schillo said. "It takes time to put together this kind of a campaign."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FORUM TO FOCUS ON SANTA CLARA RIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of Ventura and Los Angeles counties interested in the Santa Clara 
River and the threats to its future are invited to a daylong seminar May 7 
sponsored by the nonprofit Friends of the Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
 The river, which runs about 100 miles from its headwaters in the hills above 
Acton in Los Angeles County to the ocean in Oxnard, faces threats from 
development, oil spills, sand and gravel mining, street runoff and other 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just think it's a good chance to educate the public," said Ron Bottorff, 
chairman of Friends of the Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only hope for this river to be kept in its mostly natural state is for 
the public to be well-informed and involved." 
</P>
<P>
 The river is the subject of a study and enhancement plan funded primarily by 
the California Coastal Conservancy. The state agency underwrites efforts to 
protect and restore the coastal environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers at the forum will include biologist Cat Brown with the U. S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, Jeff Rosenbloom of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
Jim Danza of Friends of the Los Angeles River, Larry Rose of the Ventura County 
Agricultural Land Trust and Don Davis of the Ventura County Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Topics will include river hydrology, pollution, the river as a water resource 
and implications of the federal Clean Water Act. A question-and-answer session 
on the river's watershed will conclude the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost of the seminar is $15 if registered by Monday and $20 at the door. A 
continental breakfast and buffet lunch are included. For information, call 
Bottorff at 498-4323. JOANNA M. MILLER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: GRANT TO PROVIDE JOBS FOR QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County jobs program will receive a $2.2-million federal grant to 
provide work primarily for residents who lost their jobs in the Jan. 17 
earthquake, the U. S. Labor Department announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant, part of a $28-million package to help 2,000 displaced workers in 
Southern California, will put 174 Ventura County residents to work in public 
jobs or nonprofit agencies, said Philip Bohan, project manager for the county 
Job Training Policy Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The program actually began in February with $221,000 in seed money from the 
Labor Department and should last until March, 1995, Bohan said. The agency has 
already placed more than 120 residents in custodial, clerical or bookkeeping 
jobs related to earthquake cleanup and repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the early work involved cleaning up damaged buildings and moving 
furniture into place, Bohan said. Now many of the workers are filling in at 
overworked nonprofit agencies, such as the American Red Cross and Food Share 
Inc. In addition, some program workers will begin serving as monitors in the 
Simi Valley Unified School District in an effort to prevent violence at the 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 4,200 Ventura County residents have filed unemployment claims, 
citing the Northridge quake as the cause of their job losses. There have been 
34,000 quake-related claims in Southern California, according to the state 
Employment Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 8,000 self-employed workers in the Los Angeles region have taken 
advantage of an expanded program allowing them to seek unemployment benefits 
because of the earthquake. No figures were available for Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to workers displaced by the earthquake, the grant money is 
available to those chronically unemployed or laid off in a plant closing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department grant will also provide about $12.8 million for temporary 
workers in the city of Los Angeles and about $10 million for job programs in 
Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Conservation Corps will receive about $2 million. PHYLLIS W.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: ROBINGS SAYS HOSPITAL WING NOT RESEARCHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County supervisorial candidate H. Jere Robings charged Monday that the 
county is moving forward with a new hospital wing without sufficient financial 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 "A financial feasibility study should look at all the options," Robings said 
at a news conference Monday. "I don't think we should be asked to accept a 
project based on this skimpy information." 
</P>
<P>
 Robings held up a poster with one page of financial analysis from the county. 
He said the county needed to study possible collaboration with other hospitals 
before making a decision to proceed with the $38-million wing and parking lot 
at the Ventura County Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Robings' comments, echoing a constant theme in his campaign, came one day 
before the County Board of Supervisors and Public Facilities Corp. meet to 
discuss the project. Public Facilities must approve the bonds needed to finance 
the new wing. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors have expressed support for the proposed addition, 70% of which 
would be paid for with state funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have all the information we need, and I think it should go 
forward," Supervisor John K. Flynn said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Robings said the hospital funding "is still taxpayer money, even though it's 
coming from the state." He also charged that the new wing would put the county 
in competition with the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county hospital charter is to provide health care to the indigents, and 
it's clear the expansion project is going to provide more than just that 
service," Robings said. 
</P>
<P>
 But county officials deny that the new outpatient wing is designed to take 
private patients away from the county's other hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we're doing is building some new buildings, because some other ones are 
worn out," Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new facility will house clinics that are currently run from dilapidated 
buildings or in leased space near the hospital. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: RESTITUTION SOUGHT FOR CAMPAIGN COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An accountant who successfully challenged Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton's 
campaign for auditor-controller filed papers in Superior Court on Monday asking 
a judge to force the county -- or Stratton -- to pay his attorney's fees. 
</P>
<P>
 William Baker, one of five candidates for Ventura County auditor-controller, 
said he is seeking about $10,000 in restitution for his costs to get Stratton 
off the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for Baker successfully argued earlier this month that Stratton did not 
have the qualifications required by law to seek the office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did the taxpayers of Ventura County a favor," Baker said Monday. "He may 
have made some decisions that were based on politics rather than a professional 
auditor-controller." 
</P>
<P>
 County Counsel James McBride said Monday that his office will fight the 
motion, which is scheduled to be heard by Judge William L. Peck on May 24. Peck 
ruled April 11 that Stratton was ineligible for the office because he does not 
possess a degree in accounting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think they're entitled to recovery against the county because the 
county isn't in opposition," McBride said. "(County Clerk) Richard Dean is 
simply named because he's the one who's responsible for the ballot." 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton said Monday that he was the victim in the case, and that his 
understanding of Peck's ruling was that each side would bear its own costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker is "basically saying that if you lose the case, you have to pay the 
fees," Stratton said. "I don't think that's very American." 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates vying for the position include Baker, appointed incumbent Thomas O. 
Mahon, Richard Morrisset of Ventura, Clifford Wigen of Simi Valley and Scott 
Weiss of Ventura. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: BEACH PARTY TRAIN TOPS EXPECTATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Metrolink train service to Ventura's California Beach Party surpassed the 
city's expectations, transporting more than 2,000 of the 24,000 who came to the 
two-day weekend event, a city spokeswoman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had expected about 1,500 train riders, but 2,041 people arrived by 
Metrolink, said Debbie Solomon, a supervisor for Ventura's community services 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were rather impressed with the results," she said. "We hope to do it again 
next year." 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend's ninth annual Beach Party marked the first time that Metrolink 
train service was available. Last year, about 26,000 attended. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the high ridership, the city lost about $4,000 on its $9,000 
investment to bring Metrolink to the annual beachfront event. Some of the loss 
was attributed to passes purchased in advance by regular riders, Solomon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the weather had been better on Sunday, we would have covered our costs," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The train made stops in Moorpark, Simi Valley, Camarillo, Oxnard and Ventura.

HIGHER ASSESSMENT FOR DREDGING BACKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A homeowner assessment for dredging the Ventura Keys, a system of canals 
winding behind some of the city's most expensive beach-area homes, was given 
preliminary approval Monday by the Ventura City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Keys homeowners paid $1,733 each to keep their back-yard channels 
free of silt and debris.This year, that fee could rise to about $2,000 per 
household. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 5 to 2 to approve an engineer's report recommending the 
higher assessment. The issue will be discussed again at two public hearings 
before the council takes a final vote in June. Councilmen Jim Monahan and Jack 
Tingstrom opposed the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 However, city officials and Keys homeowners say they may soon settle a lawsuit 
brought against the city by the homeowners, making the increased taxes a moot 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the settlement, stemming from a lawsuit filed by nearly a third 
of the 300 homeowners in the assessment district, Keys residents would each pay 
$685 for last year and $749 for this year's dredging assessments, with an 
increase of no more than $64 per year after that. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the homeowners in the assessment district have said they will go along 
with the settlement. However, 49 residents have not responded to the offer, and 
11 have refused it. CONSTANCE SOMMER

PSYCHOLOGIST TESTIFIES IN TEEN-AGER'S TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 14-year-old Simi Valley junior high student charged with stabbing a 
classmate to death is "intellectually handicapped" and would act irrationally 
if pushed into a corner, a psychologist testified at the teen-ager's murder 
trial Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Emerick also said in Ventura County Superior Court that Phillip 
Hernandez is easily intimidated and shows no desire to defend himself against 
an assault. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can't fight his way out of a paper bag," Emerick told a judge hearing the 
boy's trial, which stretched into its second week on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerick is one of a handful of witnesses to testify on behalf of Hernandez, 
who is charged with fatally stabbing 14-year-old Chad Hubbard at Valley View 
Junior High School on Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 A prosecutor has said that Hernandez is a malicious killer who deserves to be 
convicted of second-degree murder. Hernandez pulled a knife and stabbed Hubbard 
in the chest when Hubbard punched the defendant and challenged him to a fight 
after school that day, witnesses testified. 
</P>
<P>
 But a defense attorney has portrayed Hubbard as a bully, saying he was stabbed 
only after physically harassing Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerick's testimony was designed to help prove the defense's theory of the 
case. Emerick said that Hernandez has a below-average IQ of 77 and that he 
suffers from post-traumatic stress since the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerick said Hernandez is now "angry and irritated at the world." 
</P>
<P>
 But during cross-examination, Deputy Dist. Atty. James D. Ellison pointed out 
that several months before the stabbing, Hernandez did not appear to have any 
problems with his self-esteem. The prosecutor noted that Hernandez bragged to a 
school official during an evaluation that he is better-looking and more popular 
than most boys his age. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez is expected to take the witness stand before the defense rests, said 
Deputy Public Defender Donna L. Forry. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; PROFESSIONAL ARTISTS JUDGE STUDENT WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time this year, the Oxnard Union High School District used 
professional artists instead of district art teachers to judge its student art 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea came from contest organizer and Hueneme High School art teacher David 
Smith, who said he thought that professional artists would be qualified to 
evaluate not only the technical expertise of student artists, but also their 
creativity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to get beyond who could draw the best and get to ideas and 
concepts," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, however, the judges gave first place to a drawing that 
demonstrated little originality but exceptional technical skills, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Copied from a National Geographic Magazine cover photo, the winning artwork by 
Rio Mesa High School senior Molly Naumann is a detailed pencil drawing of a 
small, smiling child whose forehead is nearly covered by the large hand of an 
adult. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows great technical ability," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of the best I've ever seen. It looked like a photo." 
</P>
<P>
 Molly, who plans to major in studio art at UC Davis next fall, said she drew 
the picture without any thought of entering it in the contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I drew it just because I thought it was an interesting picture and my teacher 
asked me to put it in the contest," the 18-year-old said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to capture that child's expression." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she said she was pleased by the award -- which is her first -- Molly 
said she doesn't see how the judges were able to decide the winners from among 
the top three. 
</P>
<P>
 Jocelyn Trinidad of Camarillo High School placed second and Tola Keo of 
Channel Islands High School won third. In addition, five students won honorable 
mention: Susie Terada and Jocelyn Trinidad of Camarillo High; Miguel Avila and 
Nathan Cabrera of Hueneme High; and Jose Rangel of Channel Islands High. 
</P>
<P>
 "Art is really based on interpretation," Molly said. "It depends on how your 
interpretation meets with that judge's rating." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not judges' decisions are subjective, the choice has consequences 
for the district's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Every spring, Oxnard school officials add up the points that schools have won 
in various district contests held during the year in art, music, writing, 
typing and speech. First place awards garner more points than second place, and 
so on. 
</P>
<P>
 The school with the most points gets a trophy from the district. 
</P>
<P>
 This year-end trophy added impetus to use professional artists instead of 
district art teachers to judge the art contest, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, teachers' bias toward students from their own schools sometimes 
won out over who had the best work, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just too political," he said. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THEFT CHARGE AGAINST PAIR MAY BE DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge said Monday that he has tentatively decided to throw 
out a charge of felony grand theft against two former Oxnard card-club casino 
promoters who are charged with stealing $10,000 in an unrelated construction 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty.Jeff G. Bennett said Judge Allan Steele made his statement 
during a hearing Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prosecution is fighting an uphill battle now," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Michael E. Wooten, 45, and Frank Marasco, 48, asked Steele on 
April 2 to throw out charges of grand theft against their clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooten, of Camarillo, and Marasco, of Ventura, allegedly submitted a false 
$10,000 voucher to a consortium of Ventura County investors for work on a 
development project in Santa Paula, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of paying a construction firm for overseeing the work, the defendants 
spent the money, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett has urged Steele to let the charges stand, saying the pair split the 
money after lying to get it from the investors.

 Defense attorneys, who could not be reached Monday, have told the judge that 
prosecutors have no evidence to prove the defendants broke the law. 
Acknowledging that Wooten and Marasco did not pay the construction firm to 
oversee the development project, their attorneys said the two men supervised 
the work themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate case, the defendants are charged with six misdemeanor counts of 
money laundering in connection with illegal contributions allegedly made to 
local officials, including two Oxnard councilmen. The defendants had proposed a 
card-club casino for Oxnard, but the City Council eventually rejected the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Trial on the misdemeanor counts is scheduled to begin Thursday in Municipal 
Court. DWAYNE BRAY

 A former employee of an Oxnard nonprofit organization who authorities say fled 
to the Philippines to avoid prosecution on embezzlement charges has been 
arrested, the FBI said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Norma Viceo Layug, 54, a former resident of Port Hueneme, was arrested Friday 
by the FBI at Los Angeles International Airport as she returned from the 
Philippines, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
 Layug, who worked for the Channel County Legal Services Assn. as a controller, 
was charged in 1990 with embezzlement and grand theft after an audit of the 
organization showed that about $160,000 was missing, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid being prosecuted, Layug, who had worked for the nonprofit 
organization since 1978, fled to the Philippines in November, 1988, and had not 
returned to the United States until the day of her arrest, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities had an arrest warrant for Layug since March, 1990. On April 22, 
the U.S. Customs Service informed the FBI and the Ventura County district 
attorney's office that Layug was en route to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Layug, who is scheduled to appear in court May 2, was being held in Ventura 
County Jail in lieu of $100,000 bail. CHRISTINA LIMA

FLYNN, VANDERKOLK TO RESCIND SALARY CUTS FOR THEIR ASSISTANTS; GOVERNMENT: PAIR 
REVERSE LAST YEAR'S DECISION THAT REDUCED AIDES' PAY, HOURS 10%. BUDGET SLASHES 
HIT NEARLY ALL OTHER DEPARTMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two Ventura County supervisors say they have reversed a July decision that cut 
the hours and pay of their assistants by 10% -- a change that exempts their 
offices from budget cuts that hit virtually all other county departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the aides' pay cuts improper and unfair, Supervisors John K. Flynn and 
Maria VanderKolk said Monday that they will submit paperwork to reinstate the 
full salaries of their aides. Each has three assistants, who are now paid 
between $36,000 and $50,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, county departments were required to absorb an average 10% budget cut 
to offset revenue losses for fiscal year 1993-94. Larger departments achieved 
reductions by cutting vacant positions and supplies. But the supervisors, who 
have relatively small budgets, were faced with cutting the pay of their 
employees to meet the 10% reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn and VanderKolk say their decision to increase their staffs' pay is based 
on a recent finding by County Counsel James McBride that supervisors can act 
individually to rescind the cut, an action the supervisors took as part of an 
across-the-board budget reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 McBride also found that the county should continue paying a $150-a-month car 
allowance to supervisors' secretaries, a benefit that was eliminated during the 
1993-94 budget session. 
</P>
<P>
 McBride determined that since the supervisors did not formally change the 
county's "memorandum of understanding" -- the document that outlines employee 
pay and benefits -- when they cut the car allowances, the secretaries could put 
in for back pay and continue receiving the benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Flynn's secretary was recently paid about $1,200 retroactively for her 
car allowance during the first half of the fiscal year. Requests from the 
secretaries of VanderKolk and Supervisor Vicky Howard for back payment are 
expected to be approved this week, county Auditor Controller Thomas O. Mahon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Mahon said he will increase the pay of the assistants as soon as he 
receives the paperwork from the supervisors. However, he said, the county may 
be forced to dip into its contingency fund to cover the increases. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could prove to be a delicate matter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn, who asked McBride about a month ago to look into the salary matter, 
said he believes that the increases are justified. 
</P>
<P>
 "My staff works more than 40 hours a week," Flynn said. "I cannot ask them to 
put in more hours and give them less pay. It was an inequity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a small department. It's unfair to pose the same cuts as you would a 
large department." 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk added: "(The aides) were the only people in the entire county to 
get their salaries cut. It wasn't right. It wasn't fair. I really regret that 
action." 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisors Maggie Kildee and Susan K. Lacey said they will continue to 
honor the 10% reduction, saying they feel bound by their earlier decision to 
cut the pay. Howard could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a commitment at the beginning of this year that we would help the 
county and its financial need," Kildee said. "We will honor that commitment. I 
think that is the honorable thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Lacey and Kildee said they would be willing to reconsider the matter 
during next year's budget session, but only after the board finds other 
reductions to make. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the board should do its part," Kildee said. "When deciding the budget 
(next year), we might look at this. But, I think it is something that should be 
decided in public." 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayer advocate Michael Saliba, meanwhile, said he would also prefer that 
the board members wait until budget time to take up the matter of salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should keep the cuts they instituted before," Saliba said. "This is very 
bad timing."

BOARD MAY SEEK CLAS TEST REVISION; EDUCATION: PROPOSAL BY THE CONEJO VALLEY 
DISTRICT WOULD SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF THE EXAM BUT SEEK CHANGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 State education officials should revise a controversial assessment test to 
make it less secretive, less costly and less objectionable to parents, 
according to a recommendation Thousand Oaks school board members will consider 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the resolution, the board of the Conejo Valley Unified School District 
would endorse the concept behind the California Learning Assessment System 
test, while calling on the state to fine-tune its content. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have not as yet gotten this one to be a really good test," board 
member Dorothy Beaubien said. "But I don't think we should throw it out 
completely. I think we should revise it." 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, conservative groups have raised concerns about literary passages in 
the language portion of the test. In Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley, parents 
have railed against the secrecy of the test and questions that ask for personal 
responses. Some opponents have called the exam a psychological tool, a charge 
for which Beaubien said she found no evidence after reading portions of sample 
and actual tests. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS was designed to evaluate how students think as well as their ability to 
come up with correct answers. Now in its second year, the exam is being given 
to more than 1 million fourth-, fifth-, eighth- and 10th-graders at a cost of 
$26 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley Supt. Jerry Gross, in his recommendation to the board, said the 
value of the test has been undermined by technical problems, controversial test 
items, non-specific questions and delayed results. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gross also said the concept behind CLAS has merit and should be supported 
by the board, parents and community. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to say is perhaps it needed another year of development, or 
it needs to have a little more time to get it right," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, he called for the school board to send a letter to Gov. Pete 
Wilson, the state Legislature and the Department of Education urging officials 
to make several broad changes, such as: 
</P>
<P>
 * Establishing a better system for reviewing test questions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Providing the public with more information about the test. 
</P>
<P>
 * Releasing copies of tests already administered. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reconsidering whether the state should spend $26 million at a time when 
school districts are struggling with annual budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Mildred Lynch, a Conejo Valley school board member who has been an outspoken 
critic of CLAS, said she could not support the recommendation because it 
supports the concept behind the test. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe it is a high-quality assessment system," she said. "I don't 
believe it's an assessment system at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch said she expects a large number of parents to attend the board meeting 
scheduled at 7:30 p.m. Thursday in the district offices at 1400 E. Janss Road.

THOUSAND OAKS TO LOOK AT WAYS TO BRING DAY CARE TO OLD TOWN; COUNCIL: OFFICIALS 
HAVE ALLOTTED $155,000 TO DEVELOP PROGRAMS FOR LOW-INCOME FAMILIES. THEY WILL 
CONSIDER STRATEGY AT TONIGHT'S MEETING. 
</P>

<P>
 With a potful of money at the ready, Thousand Oaks council members tonight 
will discuss how the city can encourage more child-care providers to set up 
shop in the Old Town neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The council three years ago agreed to spend $155,000 to develop child-care 
services for lower-income residents along Thousand Oaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the city has spent just $21,000 on a consultant's study analyzing the 
need for more day care. The rest of the money is up for grabs, and no one's 
quite sure what to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Should day-care providers receive loans to launch new centers? Should 
low-income families receive subsidized vouchers? Should unlicensed caretakers 
receive help obtaining state permits? Or should existing programs get grants? 
</P>
<P>
 As they debate tactics, council members will be working from one common 
assumption: Market forces have not brought day care to central Thousand Oaks, 
so the city should step in with money and muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want the city involved as a purveyor of child care, but we have to be 
facilitators, to help providers operate in this area and help our citizens 
afford it," Councilman Frank Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the Old Town neighborhood, officials are seeking inexpensive programs with 
flexible hours and the space to accommodate children with colds or other mild 
illnesses. More than half of the parents who answered a consultant's survey 
said they had trouble finding care for sick children, and 40% complained about 
problems matching their work schedule to day-care hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with 2,366 spaces available in licensed child-care centers in Thousand 
Oaks, experts estimate that thousands of local youngsters regularly spend time 
unattended or stay with unqualified baby-sitters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know the demand is there," Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. "Let's see if we 
can't fill it."  
</P>
<P>
 Child-care experts laud Thousand Oaks' goals. But they point out that other 
agencies are already working to boost the number of licensed day-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Child Development Resources, a nonprofit countywide referral group, recently 
wrapped up a state-funded recruitment campaign that succeeded in bringing 60 
new licensed providers to the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's executive director, Julie Irving, is quick to offer the city her 
staff's skills in helping Thousand Oaks drum up still more providers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've never been in this business before, you can't assume that it's easy 
to transfer your skills, (especially) if you've been in the business of doing 
roadwork, issuing building permits and keeping citizens happy," Irving said. 
"If they want to replicate what we do, they could help fund us." 
</P>
<P>
 Some local child-care providers, however, are hoping for more direct financial 
help from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherri Laboon, for one, has her eye on an Old Town building that she'd love to 
turn into a child-care center. But she knows from experience that she can't 
swing such a big project without some help. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When she founded the Roots and Wings Child Care Center in Thousand Oaks four 
years ago, Laboon was saddled with "hundreds of ridiculous conditions" from the 
Planning Department, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tab for landscaping her parking lot came to $30,000. Installing a block 
wall in the side yard cost $10,000. And replacing a chain-link fence with 
decorative wrought iron set her back $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "All that, without even spending a cent on the children or the program," 
Laboon said ruefully. "We're just not able to charge enough to make up the 
cost" of complying with Thousand Oaks' standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "By over-regulating planning issues, they've really put a damper on child 
care," she added. "The only way it's going to happen is if the city steps in." 
</P>
<P>
 For herself, Laboon would like a $75,000 grant. Other child-care providers 
said low-interest loans and help obtaining permits would be enough. And even 
those who wouldn't benefit directly said they supported the city's efforts to 
target Old Town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Child care and education are really needed there," said Camille Eastin, 
president of the Conejo Valley Family Child Care Assn. "It would certainly be 
beneficial if the city would be willing to help."

APRIL SHOWERS CAUSE MINOR CAR ACCIDENTS; WEATHER: RAIN SHOULD END BY THIS 
AFTERNOON AND CLOUDS MAY LINGER THROUGH WEDNESDAY. BUT OFFICIAL SAYS MOISTURE 
IS ONLY 68% OF NORMAL.

 Scattered showers caused inconvenience and minor accidents on the county's 
freeways Monday, but precipitation for the season remains far short of the 
average, a spokesman for Ventura County Flood Control District said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even with Monday's rain, we're still at only 68% of normal," spokesman Jared 
McFarland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters predicted more light showers throughout the county this morning, 
ending by early afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura, Oxnard, Ojai and Camarillo had slightly more than a quarter of an 
inch of rain by 5 p.m., while lower totals were reported in Thousand Oaks and 
Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol reported numerous small accidents but no serious 
injuries as cars slipped and slid on rain-soaked roads. 
</P>
<P>
 One stretch of the northbound Ventura Freeway in Thousand Oaks proved 
particularly hazardous, producing three multiple-car pileups. The worst 
involved five cars and occurred near the Moorpark Road exit, but only minor 
injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Cloudy skies are expected to linger through Wednesday, according to 
meteorologist David Gomberg of the National Weather Service in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a potentially weak system behind this one that should come in on 
Wednesday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But rainfall after this morning is unlikely, he said. The weather should be 
breezy, with winds at 20 to 30 m.p.h. and high temperatures in the 60s. Lows 
should be in the low 50s, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's winds and Monday's rain improved the county's air quality, according 
to Gary Archemont of the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got great quality right now," Archemont said. "This is typical of a 
very clean April day." 
</P>
<P>
 From Simi Valley to Ventura, ozone ratings have been good since Saturday, 
thanks primarily to the weather front from Alaska that dumped rain on the 
region Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "All that wind blowing in from the west really disperses the pollution," 
Archemont said, adding that residents can expect the clean air to last at least 
until Thursday. County Rainfall

ROBBER BECOMES 1ST IN COUNTY CHARGED UNDER '3 STRIKES' LAW; SIMI VALLEY: THE 
PAROLED CONVICT NOW FACES 10 FELONY COUNTS OF CHILD MOLESTATION. HE IS BEING 
HELD WITHOUT BAIL AND FACES ARRAIGNMENT TODAY.

<P>
 A three-time convicted robber now facing 10 felony counts of child molestation 
is the first Ventura County man to be charged under the state's new "three 
strikes and you're out" law, prosecutors said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they raided Henry Diaz's Simi Valley home last month and found him 
in bed with a 13-year-old girl. Diaz, 40, is on parole for the three prior 
felony robbery convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the message is pretty self-evident," Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin 
J. McGee said. "If you continue to engage in criminal conduct, you are looking 
at the potential of 25 years to life" in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 McGee said officials decided last week to charge Diaz under the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz is scheduled to appear in Ventura County Municipal Court for arraignment 
this morning and has not yet entered a plea to the charges. It was not clear if 
he has yet obtained an attorney. He was being held in Ventura County Jail 
without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz is one of two men prosecutors were considering charging under the "three 
strikes" law. Prosecutors have not announced whether a decision has been made 
in the second case, against Jose Castaneda, 25, of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Castaneda is charged with murder in the April 2 death of his wife, Mina 
Castaneda, also 25. The Oxnard College student, who had dreams of becoming a 
teacher, died after being shot in the head during an argument with her husband, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaneda has two previous armed robbery convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office decided April 12 not to use the new law against 
Preston A. Shelton of Oxnard -- who was charged with cultivating marijuana 
plants, a felony, only hours after Gov. Pete Wilson signed the three strikes 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted under the law, defendants face a mandatory sentence of 25 years 
to life. The statute prescribes such a sentence for anyone with two prior 
serious or violent felony convictions who commits a third felony. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Simi Valley police SWAT team and narcotics detectives raided 
Diaz's Sitka Avenue home about 7 a.m. March 22 after his parole office reported 
possible violations. That is when he was discovered in bed with the young girl, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 McGee said prosecutors decided to charge Diaz under the new law because this 
would be his fourth felony conviction.

 Two of the Board of Supervisors having closed meetings with a private interest 
group about the taxpayers' business? Yes, fellow taxpayers, this really 
happened on Thursday, March 31, 1994, just 14 hours before this sort of meeting 
was declared illegal by California state law. The meeting was held in private 
offices off Mills Road.It lasted about 90 non-smoke-filled minutes, according 
to Supervisors (Maggie) Kildee and (Susan K.) Lacey. (They) don't want a 
consultant to split up the patients in the hospital dispute. Sure took a long 
time to say no. 
</P>
<P>
 More than $100 million worth of bond indebtedness is being heaped upon our 
taxpaying backs for a hospital expansion. That we were not given a chance to 
vote for this collective debt, when half the hospital beds in the county are 
empty, is appalling. We may be forced to build a huge, brand-new hospital that 
may well be less than half full unless the county supervisors can find a large 
number of charity patients somewhere to fill the beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess what, folks, they have not even done a countywide study on our new 
in-debt hospital and its effects. On April 26 at 1:30 p.m. at the County 
Government Center, there will be a public hearing on this matter. Let your 
taxpaying voice be heard. 
</P>
<P>
 We must have a blue-ribbon panel study on hospital expansion. Will the 
supervisors have a study by impartial reputable citizens from all sides? All 
citizens in this county deserve no less.

RESCUERS PRAISED

<TEXT>
<P>
 Many thanks and praises to the two young women (in separate cars) who stopped 
to assist my daughter in her wrecked car on the Simi Valley Freeway, who stayed 
with her until the ambulance and other rescue personnel arrived. Thanks also to 
the gentleman who stopped and allowed my daughter to use his car phone to call 
her husband, and to the rescue and hospital personnel whom we generally take 
for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs down to the owner of the late-model Corvette who lost control of his 
car when entering the freeway, careened through all eastbound lanes to end up 
completely turned around in the left lane facing and crashing with my 
daughter's car. Fortunately, he did not seriously maim or kill anyone. He did 
not give her his name or telephone number. He moved his car before police 
arrived; he did not offer to call someone for her on his car phone. 
</P>
<P>
 But look at the odds -- many more acts of kindness were shown to offset one 
man's self-absorption.

SERVICE YARD DUE FOR ARTFUL SPRUCING UP; THOUSAND OAKS: PROGRAM ADOPTED IN 1985 
CALLS FOR THE CITY TO SET ASIDE AT LEAST 1% OF ALL PUBLIC WORKS EXPENDITURES 
FOR SUCH PROJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As challenges go, this one should be a doozy. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks officials are seeking a piece of art to grace the new city 
service yard on Rancho Conejo Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The work must blend with off-beat decor -- a mottled earth-tone building 
surrounded by extra traffic signals, spare buses and dusty machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 It should reflect the mission of workers who use the facility -- to repair 
city vehicles, coordinate landscaping and run the water department. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's got to be cheap -- just $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, "it will require some creativity," Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city service yard, located in the far reaches of an industrial park on the 
brink of a remote canyon, might seem an unlikely site for a piece of art. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, most action in the 10-acre facility takes place after dusk or 
before dawn, when maintenance workers tinker with city vehicles and fuel up 
freshly washed buses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not traditionally thought of as a people place," Zukowski admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 But arts commissioners note that the municipal service yard attracts thousands 
of visitors each year. The city collects recyclable household waste at the 
yard, so residents routinely drop by lugging motor oil, water-based paints and 
antifreeze. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As they drop off their junk, at least a few might spare a glance for artwork. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a very visible, well-seen piece," arts Commissioner Howard 
Leong predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 His colleague, Jeanette Baker, added optimistically: "I know we can come up 
with something." 
</P>
<P>
 By law, they have to. 
</P>
<P>
 Adopted as an official ordinance in 1985, Thousand Oaks' Percent for the Arts 
program calls for the city to set aside at least 1% of all public works 
expenditures for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, every city project, including street repairs and installation of 
traffic lights, should funnel cash into a Municipal Arts Fund. But given tight 
budgets and a tough economy, council members have applied the 1% rule only to 
new construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senior Center, for example, generated a $40,000 Percent for the Arts fund, 
which went to purchase a bronze sculpture featuring a grandfather reading to 
children. Entitled "Generations," the sculpture speaks to the family values 
that politicians often tout as a cornerstone of life in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The art will always be here, even when the rest of us are gone," said Carol 
Williams, the city's cultural liaison. "Not only do the pieces enhance the 
aesthetics of our buildings, but they give a sense of history as well." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After scouting the service yard site last week, arts commissioners agreed that 
the best bet might be some kind of fountain, which would represent the city's 
water department and blend with the utilitarian surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 They remain open to other suggestions, however, and will soon solicit 
proposals from artists nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Percent for the Arts law does allow some flexibility for city officials. 
Instead of commissioning a fresh sculpture, they can spend the 1% fund in 
support of local theaters or museums. 
</P>
<P>
 The arts funds set aside for the Newbury Park Branch Library, for example, 
went to spiff up a nearby community gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 And just last year, the council voted to spend the Civic Arts Plaza's Percent 
for the Arts on the building itself, counting the 400-seat community theater as 
a valid use of 1% funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Several arts commissioners protested that decision. Their disappointment is 
muted now, but some still wish that the city could devote the 1% to enhancing 
visual arts at a facility touted largely for its performance space. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those of us who wrote the ordinance and worked so hard to get it passed had 
envisioned some kind of sculpture garden (at the Civic Arts Plaza), perhaps 
representing the area's heritage or the site's former use as Jungleland," said 
local architect Dan Witting, a former arts commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 But overall, Witting said he was pleased that the $64-million Civic Arts Plaza 
does include some artistic architectural features -- such as an outdoor curtain 
made from shimmering copper panels and a series of mini-windows cut to resemble 
Chumash pictographs. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's looking forward to seeing a piece of free-standing art at the new 
municipal service yard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Thousand Oaks arts backers move ahead with plans to adorn public spaces, 
officials in Oxnard are busy installing art on private property. 
</P>
<P>
 By asking developers for contributions to the city's art fund, Oxnard has 
collected more than $1 million since 1985. The city has used the money to 
decorate some 30 commercial and industrial buildings, said Andrew Voth, 
cultural arts supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Following Oxnard's lead, Moorpark officials hope to jump-start a similar 
program that's been languishing, inactive, on the city books. And in Ojai, arts 
commissioners have proposed a law requiring developers to ante up 1% of a 
building's construction budget for artwork. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thousand Oaks arts commissioners have no plans to expand their program to 
private commercial projects. Because developers already pay significant fees 
for parks, schools and other services, city officials have been reluctant to 
add an arts levy. 
</P>
<P>
 As is, Baker said, the Percent for the Arts program has proved worthwhile. "In 
time," she added, "it will come to have a great deal of meaning to this 
community."

LACK OF TRUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let me express how much I appreciate Ventura City Councilman Jim Monahan's 
"Father Knows Best" attitude toward the residents of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 He has no faith on our advisory vote (on a water desalination plant) as we 
"were confused on what we were voting on."Isn't it nice to have our elected 
officials listen and have trust in our intelligence? 
</P>
<P>
 But, since "there was a lot of misinformation circulating during the 
campaign," we can be secure in the knowledge that the information from Mr. 
Monahan and the state water proponents was perfectly clear and honest. 
Therefore, all the "misinformation" must have come from the desalination 
proponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Gee, thanks Mr. Monahan for taking me by the hand and, with your level-headed 
clear vision and experience, setting me straight. When you are up for 
reelection, I hope the "confused and misinformed" residents of the city of 
Ventura remember your attitude.

DEVIOUS PETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We at the American Lung Assn. of Ventura County have been inundated with 
telephone calls about a petition referred to as the "California Uniform Tobacco 
Quality Control Act." Almost all of our callers have read the petition and 
arrived at the conclusion that it was grossly misrepresented to them. The 
American Lung Assn. calls this the "Phillip Morris Initiative." This initiative 
petition represents a devious attempt by tobacco interests to undermine the 
progress we have made to protect the health of over 90% of the population 
(including children) who do not smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Phillip Morris Initiative" sounds, at face, to be a good measure to 
control exposure to secondhand smoke and create uniform laws in the area of 
tobacco control, unless you read the petition. This initiative allows 
restaurants to have a 25% smoking section. Secondhand smoke does not respect 
this limitation and, while harmful to all living creatures and plants, it is 
particularly harmful to children, asthmatics and the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 This initiative is designed to eliminate all local ordinances already in place 
and will exclude any future change by local jurisdictions. If this deceptive 
initiative were to become law, the tobacco industry becomes the winner. We feel 
that this issue is, and should continue to be, a local issue unless the 
initiative is to be a 100% ban in all workplaces. Let us remember, this is a 
public health issue, not a personal rights issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Please look at the back of the envelope in which the petition is mailed. In 
the very small letters, look to see who is responsible for this sanctimonious 
effort to undo what the vast majority of the people are striving for: clean, 
healthy air. Do not sign this petition unless you want to take a giant step 
backward.

 The issue regarding the Port Hueneme Police Department on the upcoming ballot 
would not exist if the City Council had not wasted more than $1 million waging 
a war against the citizens of this financially strapped city over the proposed 
RV park. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of the RV park is indicative of the lack of intelligence and 
management ability of our highly paid city manager and most members of our City 
Council. It is definitely time for some new faces and ideas around City Hall.

ANALYSIS; RAMS TAKE QUICK FIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams passed on a quarterback, took an offensive tackle, and as Coach Chuck 
Knox repeatedly said Monday, "Time will tell." 
</P>
<P>
 Time will tell if Chuck Knox remains coach of the Rams after this season. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's NFL draft, which included the Rams' contribution to better days 
ahead in Tampa Bay with Trent Dilfer at quarterback, pivoted on this team's 
willingness to give Knox a fighting chance to remain employed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dilfer's selection, as Knox pointed out Wednesday, was the obvious choice for 
the Rams' long-term success. Carolina and Jacksonville will have the top two 
picks next year and will be trolling for a starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection of Dilfer, at the very least, could have provided fodder for 
trade talks with Carolina and Jacksonville next season. 
</P>
<P>
 At best Dilfer was there if Chris Miller's knee, which has been surgically 
repaired twice in the last two years, gave way. At the very best the Rams had a 
quarterback the likes of Rick Mirer and Drew Bledsoe to carry them into the 
next century. 
</P>
<P>
 Time will tell if Dilfer has the skills to become a franchise quarterback, but 
Knox has no such time, and so the Rams addressed the pressing needs that will 
give them a chance to be successful this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell me that I have three more years on my contract and I say, 'Take Dilfer,' 
" said one of the Ram assistant coaches. "But I've got one year to win or I'm 
not here next season." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox and his assistant coaches are working on two-year contracts, but they are 
aware that John Shaw, the team's executive vice president, considered making a 
move on Norv Turner after last season before Turner became Washington's coach. 
</P>
<P>
 They hear the rumors, and they are aware that former Dallas Coach Jimmy 
Johnson, who will be working up the highway for the Fox Television Network, is 
a likely candidate to renew interest in a franchise that either will move or 
opt to remain in place after threatening to move. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox & his staff must win in 1994, and putting a clipboard in Dilfer's hands 
does nothing to contribute to such success. A left offensive tackle, a wide 
receiver and a strong safety are the immediate answers. 
</P>
<P>
 The quick fix versus Dilfer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams had Michigan State quarterback Jim Miller ranked as a potential 
second-round choice, and while John Becker, the team's director of player 
personnel, had to be restrained, the team ignored him in favor of immediate 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pittsburgh Steelers took Miller in the sixth round shortly after the Rams 
had made their ninth pick -- Oklahoma tight end Rickey Brady to fill the 
vacancy left by Pat Carter, who signed with Houston. The quick fix. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the draft the front office said there was no decision to be made: As 
everyone in the NFL knows, if a top-rated quarterback remains on the board, a 
team must take him. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox, who ordinarily won't confirm what day of the week it is, went public 
five days before the draft and said the same thing. In hindsight, this break in 
character was more a reminder to his peers to do the right thing and (please) 
take a quarterback, than it was a revelation of what was to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox expected Heath Shuler and Dilfer to be gone. He counted on it. Fact is, 
an hour before the draft, Knox told a reporter he had Indianapolis with the 
second choice taking Shuler, and Washington with the third pick getting Dilfer. 
No quarterback for the Rams to take, thank heavens. 
</P>
<P>
 The chaos that followed then was not all that surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams didn't want Dilfer and then Dallas owner Jerry Jones told them they 
couldn't have wide receiver Alvin Harper. And still they didn't want Dilfer. 
</P>
<P>
 They passed on the quarterback with Shaw acquiescing to Knox's request for 
immediate help, although Dilfer would undoubtedly have increased this 
franchise's value in upcoming discussions to move. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was absolutely no disagreement at any time about the course of action 
we were going to pursue," Knox said. "There was none, absolutely none. . . . As 
far as the decision that was made, it was a unanimous decision." 
</P>
<P>
 The future be damned. The Rams backpedaled to the seventh position and then 
fooled themselves into thinking they could still deal with Jones for Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurned again by Jones, they moved back to 15 and took Gandy, although their 
own homework showed such a move to be foolhardy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' coaching staff had conducted a survey and found only two offensive 
tackles picked in the first round dating back to 1988 had successfully held 
their ground: Tampa's Paul Gruber and New Orleans' Willie Roaf. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with such information, the coaches insisted on trading for Houston 
tackle Kevin Donnalley. Houston balked, Gandy became the projected starting 
left tackle and now someone is going to have to hide that survey from Chris 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to pass on Dilfer, while debatable, is not as troubling as the 
Rams' panic and ensuing retreat in Round 1. Who knows if Gandy & Co., will 
fulfill expectations? The Rams finished 5-11, had the fifth pick in the draft 
and today their prospects for success rest on the back of a player (Gandy) who 
has a defect in his spine, according to team doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams not only passed on Dilfer but ignored blue-chip defenders such as 
Nebraska linebacker Trev Alberts and Alabama cornerback Antonio Langham. They 
gave Notre Dame defensive lineman Bryant Young to rival San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 No single player was going to save Knox & Co.; it was going to take an army of 
draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time will tell whether we were right or not," Knox said. "That's what it is 
all about." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what this draft was all about.

 Although John played parts of four seasons with the Angels, the left-hander 
spent perhaps the best years of his 26-year major league career as a Dodger 
from 1972 through 1978. His 7-1 victory against the Pittsburgh Pirates 18 years 
ago today was his first after surgery to repair an elbow injury that sidelined 
him for nearly two years.John was the National League's comeback player of the 
year in 1976 and helped the Dodgers win pennants in '77 and '78, winning 20 
games in '77. Now 50, he is a broadcaster for the Minnesota Twins.

 Nearly flawless as a fielder, Grich hit for power and average. A cornerstone 
of all three of the Angels' divisional championship teams, Grich set a major 
league record in 1985 by fielding .997 and ranks among the top three in nine 
Angel lifetime batting categories. Grich's 10 years with the club and 17-year 
major league career ended in 1986. Now 45 and living in the Long Beach area, he 
spends much of his time playing golf. DAVID W. MYERS

 Don't you just love it? The NFL draft is complete, and everybody won. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody reached. Nobody traded down when they should have traded up. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody, but nobody, selected a stiff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course everybody likes all of their draft picks," said Charley Casserly, 
Washington Redskin general manager. "If you don't like your draft picks now, 
when are you going to like them?" 
</P>
<P>
 But we know better. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime during the last two days, in some draft room around the league, 
somebody cursed. Somebody fell on the floor. Somebody kicked a chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody won. And somebody lost. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no loser like Charlie Ward, the Florida State quarterback. By the 
time the draft ended Monday afternoon, he had become the first Heisman Trophy 
winner in 35 years not to be selected. The 1983 winner, Mike Rozier of 
Nebraska, wasn't drafted, but he had already signed to play in the U.S. 
Football League. 
</P>
<P>
 A linebacker named Thomas Beer from Wayne State (Mich.) was picked, but not 
the quarterback of the national champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven rounds, 222 picks, nearly 15 hours, and not one phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 In a clear voice, the NFL said it no longer has time for players who wish to 
leverage their sport against another sport. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ward's case, that other sport is basketball, where he has a future as a 
point guard. The NBA is now probably stuck with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have picked Charlie in a minute if he had just made up his mind," 
said John Becker, director of player personnel for the Rams. "I loved his 
mobility and athleticism. What killed him was his inability to make a 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, whose size, 6 feet, also worked against him, intimated that these last 
two days have made his decision for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now the NBA draft is coming up, and I have a chance to prove myself in that 
sport," he said. "The NFL has given me the first step to see what my options 
are." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking giant steps in the draft were the San Francisco 49ers. They were the 
biggest winners. 
</P>
<P>
 By trading up with the Rams in the first round while maintaining one of their 
original two first-round picks, they filled immediate needs with defensive 
tackle Bryant Young of Notre Dame and fullback William Floyd of Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
 Young will replace traded Ted Washington on the rebuilt defensive line, and 
Floyd will replace free agent Tom Rathman, who will probably not be re-signed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 49ers weren't through. They might have stolen a cornerback to replace 
Don Griffin by taking speedy Tyronne Drakeford of Virginia Tech in the second 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 And they finally replaced struggling kicker Mike Cofer with Doug Brien of 
California in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like what the 49ers did," Becker conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 Other winners and losers: 
</P>
<P>
 Winner: Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition of free agent running back Harvey Williams from the Kansas 
City Chiefs could result in nothing but trouble. This is a guy who couldn't 
even be positively influenced by Marcus Allen.  
</P>
<P>
 But then Al Davis made a good move when he acknowledged that Williams might 
not be the answer by drafting Nebraska's Calvin Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis filled his other need by taking three linebackers, including 
first-rounder Rob Fredrickson of Michigan State, who won our hearts the moment 
he said his idol was Ted (the Mad Stork) Hendricks. 
</P>
<P>
 Loser: Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Football people say they made the most of their 10 picks, and that Becker 
might have stolen two second-round starters in receiver Isaac Bruce (Memphis 
State) and safety Toby Wright (Nebraska). 
</P>
<P>
 But we still can't forget that they had a chance to select perhaps the most 
talented quarterback in the draft, Trent Dilfer, and somehow let both the pick 
and the value for the pick slip away. 
</P>
<P>
 So the player they really wanted was wide receiver Alvin Harper. Would it 
surprise you to learn that the Eagles offered them Calvin Williams only last 
week, plus two No. 1 picks, for that Dilfer spot? 
</P>
<P>
 Winner: Jamir Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 In a matter of hours, the former UCLA star went from a low first-round pick to 
starting linebacker for Buddy Ryan's Arizona Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Loser: Marvin Goodwin. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite warnings from an NFL committee that he would not be a first- or 
second-round pick, this former UCLA defensive back nonetheless left college 
after his junior season. 
</P>
<P>
 The result? He was the 144th player taken, in the fifth round by the 
Philadelphia Eagles. It doesn't quite sound worth the price of an education. 
</P>
<P>
 Winner: Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns might have had the best first round, stealing Alabama cornerback 
Antonio Langham with the ninth overall pick and then pinching themselves to 
discover Michigan receiver Derrick Alexander still there at 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Add top nose tackle Romeo Bandison of Oregon in the third round, and Bernie 
Kosar might actually start missing the place. 
</P>
<P>
 Loser: Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 This draft, combined with the Browns' picks, changes the balance of power in 
the AFC Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Late reports say that first-round pick Henry Ford, a defensive end from 
Arkansas, is an Edsel. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Oilers rebound in the second round by taking defensive end Jeremy 
Nunley of Alabama, about whom one scouting report says, "Not as good as Shane 
Dronett." 
</P>
<P>
 Winner: Jim Harbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Once known only as the quarterback Mike Ditka wanted to kill, he will now also 
be known as the guy whose presence persuaded Indianapolis Colt General Manager 
Bill Tobin to ignore Trent Dilfer for Trev Alberts. 
</P>
<P>
 Loser: Randall Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philadelphia Eagle quarterback was offered to the Rams for their first 
pick. He was offered to the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers for 
their respective No. 1s.  
</P>
<P>
 Winner: New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't care what UCLA fans tell you, USC defensive end Willie McGinest was 
not a reach at fourth overall. 
</P>
<P>
 And we don't care what Charger fans tell you, we think running back Marion 
Butts, acquired in a trade for draft picks Monday, can find new life under Bill 
Parcells. And we love second-round pick Kevin Lee of Alabama, a tall, fast wide 
receiver in the mode of Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 Loser: Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 Just when it seemed as if this franchise had survived several controversial 
seasons, just when they were finally sold by Norman Braman, they have a second 
round like this: 
</P>
<P>
 In a span of six picks, they selected the two players with checkered pasts. 
The 37th overall pick was UCLA's Bruce Walker, who was suspended for all of 
last season after being charged with receiving stolen property. Five picks 
later, the Eagles took Tennessee running back Charlie Garner, whose agent 
recently sent every club a letter regarding marijuana allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Randall Cunningham should feel lucky that they don't want him any more.

RETURN OF THE; WALLACH WALLOP; THIRD BASEMAN IS ON A TEAR SINCE BECOMING 
CLEANUP HITTER FOR THE DODGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The uppercut is gone now. Tim Wallach's swing is straighter, smoother and more 
explosive. 
</P>
<P>
 He is no longer pulling the ball into somebody's glove; instead, he crushes 
it, usually to left-center field, sometimes to the opposite field. He has hit 
six homers and driven in 19 runs, tying him for third in the league. He is 
batting .294. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he began batting in the cleanup spot April 14, the Dodgers have broken 
out of their offensive slump. In that role, Wallach is batting .385 with five 
home runs and 14 runs batted in. During that time, Mike Piazza, hitting third, 
has batted .400, in part because teams no longer pitch around him to get to 
Wallach, who is batting .381 with four home runs and nine RBIs with runners in 
scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
 There were high expectations for Wallach when he came to the Dodgers from the 
Montreal Expos before last season. The Dodgers needed him to stabilize what was 
then the worst defense in the National League, and he did. They wanted him to 
drive in 80 runs and hit about 16 homers, but a three-week stint on the 
disabled list slowed him. 
</P>
<P>
 They asked him to bring some leadership, on and off the field, and he 
accomplished that merely by showing up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers committed to Wallach for two seasons -- his contract is up this 
year -- and were hoping by now there would be some youngster with power they 
could promote to the third base job, but there is no one ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Wallach has other plans. At 36, he has heard it said that he is past 
his prime, but he never believed it. Offensively, he has struggled since 1991, 
when he batted .225. But he always believed he could regain his stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always a No. 1 project in Montreal . . . somebody was always trying to 
get me to hit down on the ball," said Wallach, who is in his 14th major league 
season. "I was swinging down so much that I was trying to hit the ball all over 
the field, and my best power is left-center and right-center, and I was pulling 
the ball, and that's just not me. 
</P>
<P>
 "It eroded from there. I had always had confidence that my physical skills 
were not gone, but I struggled. People were trying to help, and I appreciate 
that, but I won't place the blame on them -- they can't go out there and hit 
the ball for me. I should know myself by now and I do, but I got away from 
being myself at the plate." 
</P>
<P>
 The erosion went from physical to mental, and Wallach couldn't stop it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Slumps in baseball for everybody become mental, then if you start to change 
your physical approach, it prolongs it," said Angel Manager Buck Rodgers, who 
managed Wallach for six seasons in Montreal.  
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever Tim went into a slump, it's because he didn't go to the opposite 
field, because he tried to pull the ball too much. As long as he stayed to 
right field, he was fine." 
</P>
<P>
 As confident as he is, Wallach still bristled when Rodgers made some negative 
comments about him recently, saying that Wallach's best season, 1987, was 
because of a juiced baseball. Rodgers later explained that he was 
misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said that the last time the ball was supposed to be juiced was in 1987, and 
Tim Wallach had had a hell of a year, but not because the ball was juiced," 
Rodgers said. "What I said is that anybody that had a good year, had a better 
year. But you don't have 50 RBIs with two out, like Tim did, because of a 
juiced ball. I have tried to call Tim and left a message, because I want him to 
know I didn't say that. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was one of my all-time favorites. This was a guy who played three weeks 
with a broken foot to finish out a season. There's a term we have in baseball, 
and that's gamer. To call someone a gamer is the highest compliment, and 
Wallach is a gamer." 
</P>
<P>
 Gamer that he is, not hitting his weight was tearing at his pride. So during 
the winter, Wallach worked intensely at Dodger Stadium with Reggie Smith, the 
team's hitting instructor. They poured over videotapes of Wallach's good years, 
such as 1990, when he batted .296 with 21 home runs and 98 RBIs, and 1987, when 
he batted .298 with 26 homers and 123 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had some physical flaws in my swing and when you have that and you 
struggle, then it gets to you mentally," Wallach said. "I think the struggles 
began after '91 when I tried to change things rather than going along with what 
I have done and working on the things I have done well instead of trying to get 
better at the things I didn't do well. And that's what Reggie said. He told me 
to work on the positives and forget about the things I don't do well." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallach, after beginning the season hitless in 13 at-bats, is batting .364 in 
his last 15 games. Sunday night against Montreal, he hit two shots into the 
left-center field seats -- the first time he has hit two in a game since 1990. 
Defensively, he is quicker after working out all winter, and has made only one 
error this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Eli struggles, he's still the same," said Larry Walker, former Montreal 
teammate. "In fact, he's actually funnier when he's struggling. He's the kind 
of guy who makes you want to come to the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fans can think he has a bad attitude because of the way he loafs around on 
the field, but he is a team player. He is not fast, kind of a slow, droopy guy, 
but that's just Tim. The fans in Montreal loved him, he stuck it out up there 
when everybody else was leaving." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take long for Wallach to become a leader in the Dodger clubhouse. He 
uses a sarcastic approach, always ragging on the other players. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took an active leadership role by just being himself, and himself is a 
very personal person that you can't help but like," reliever Roger McDowell 
said. "If there is some kind of conflict you have with Tim Wallach, then you 
don't get along with anybody.  
</P>
<P>
 "Tim has had to work for everything he has achieved, and people see that and 
appreciate it, not only because of the years he has had but the type of years, 
the (five) gold gloves, and he has played with people you read about, and we 
will read about him some day." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallach, who played at Cal State Fullerton and still lives in Orange County, 
would like to end his career with the Dodgers, but he is not ready to quit. 
What is driving him this season is not a new contract -- he is making $3.3 
million this season -- but a desire to play in a World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "If for some reason I wasn't to play after this season, and we didn't win, 
there will always be a void, because the only thing I have missing from my 
career is a world championship. If the Dodgers don't re-sign me, maybe I would 
go somewhere else, but it would depend on what team and if they had a chance to 
win.  
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like physically and mentally I can still play. I have done the things 
I wanted to do in the game. I have had good years . . . I have struggled, but I 
can live with that. I am happy with the years that I have had and how I have 
worked at it. I feel good about that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I just want to get that ring."

MEN OF TEAL; IN SAN JOSE, SHARKS KNOW THE WAY TO BRING OUT TRUE COLORS IN FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first note sounds, and the fans take their cue. 
</P>
<P>
 Curving their hands into claws, fingers spread, one palm facing up and the 
other down, they move as one body with 34,380 arms. To the ominous rumbling of 
the theme from "Jaws," they drop their top hands down and move their bottom 
hands up, creating a sea of snapping mouths ready to chomp anyone not wearing 
teal, black and white. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the Shark Tank. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit fans have their octopus, thrown onto the ice before playoff games 
since the days it took eight victories to win the Stanley Cup. Montreal fans 
have their glorious history and the ghosts who inhabit the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose Shark fans, with barely three seasons to look back on -- not that 
they'd want to remember the first two -- have a zeal for teal. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a feeding frenzy," said Steven Stratton, a San Jose insurance agent 
and financial adviser. "I lived in California and watched the Kings, but it was 
never like this. Having the Sharks come to town, to the bedroom community of 
San Jose, it was really something I wanted to get in on." 
</P>
<P>
 This passion for the Sharks, built on civic pride and primed by clever 
marketing, is blossoming in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs advertising space for rent in office buildings are printed in white on 
teal backgrounds. Prominent teal letters dominate a billboard on Santa Clara 
Street, near the new, $162.5-million San Jose Arena (a.k.a the Tank). Along 
busy Almaden Boulevard, lines on the sidewalk marking the location of 
underground sewer lines are painted in teal. The marquee outside the Holiday 
Inn flashes three messages: "Welcome Democratic Century Club. Hello Cathedral 
of Faith. Go Sharks!" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny to see, and we appreciate it for sure," said goaltender Arturs 
Irbe, the team's most popular player. "We have to thank our organization for 
the colors and the logo, and we are proud people are wearing our logos and 
symbols." 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing Shark colors has become more than a fashion statement for the trendy. 
The Sharks reached the Stanley Cup playoffs this season for the first time, 
beating out the Kings and Mighty Ducks for the eighth Western Conference 
playoff spot. Their unlikely success -- they won 17 games their first season 
and only 11 last season -- has captured the fans' hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first two years, they suffered. We were kind of a joke around the 
league," forward Gaetan Duchesne said. "But they kept coming and coming this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 They come to the team store in a steady stream. Bonnie Conte, working the cash 
register, can hardly keep up with the demand for souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1 p.m. last Friday, she had run out of bags, so buyers left with arms full 
of unwrapped goodies. Showing good taste -- and good credit lines -- they 
ignored the $8 hockey stick toothbrush holders to snatch piles of black 
T-shirts ($22.95 each) depicting an open-jawed Shark and the warning, "First 
attack on the post-season." Those shirts are the top seller, along with a teal 
shirt with a Shark breaking through a sheet of ice and the slogan, "The 
playoffs used to be safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Conte's earrings, tiny black Sharks piercing her lobes, were not for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been a fan since the beginning, and more so since I've been at the 
store," she said. "Everyone is a fan. The last few days have been really great. 
You can walk out on the street and see people at bus stops and business people 
coming out of work wearing teal. That makes it great for the players to show 
our support." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone wants to support the Sharks, though not everyone wants to pay for the 
privilege. Last week, four men were arrested for breaking into the arena. Their 
booty? Not money. Not tickets. They pilfered shirts, pucks, key chains and a 
stuffed toy of S.J. Sharkie, the team mascot. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who took the legal route to fandom had to act fast. The 3,300 tickets 
available for the first two playoff games against the Detroit Red Wings were 
sold in 18 minutes. The 3,300 tickets for tonight's Game 5 vanished in 11 
minutes. Barbra Streisand took 26 minutes to sell out the place. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Sharks asked fans to wear team colors to the home playoff opener, and 
about 95% complied. "Reveal your teal," was the theme, and they revealed it in 
jerseys with players' names on the back, their names, or whimsical messages 
such as "Stanley 1" or "Playov '94." They roared when the players skated onto 
the ice through the mouth of a huge, snarling shark, creating sound waves that 
set decorative teal, white and black balloons bouncing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get, what is it called, goose bumps?" said center Igor Larionov, a star 
of the great Soviet teams of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Said right wing Ulf Dahlen: "When we've been down in big games, they've gotten 
behind us and lifted us. They might be number one in the league." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sharks were No. 1 among NHL teams in merchandise sales in their first 
season and third among all pro teams, behind the Chicago Bulls and the Raiders. 
According to Bernadette Mansur, NHL director of corporate communications, the 
Sharks retained their popularity this season despite competition from the 
relentlessly marketed Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sharks touched off a quantum leap in sales of NHL licensed merchandise 
from $100 million in 1989 to $800 million in 1992-93. Sales are projected to 
reach $1.1 billion for the fiscal year ending in June, a third of what the NBA 
and NFL ring up but significant to the newly marketing-conscious NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every expectation is (the Sharks) are going to be one of the front-runners, 
if not the front-runner," Mansur said. "Their penetration is deep on the West 
Coast, but the Sharks' distribution is pretty much national." 
</P>
<P>
 Make that international. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, in a photograph printed in newspapers around the world, Princess 
Diana of Wales posed with her sons during a ski trip. Prince William, second in 
line to the throne of England, was wearing a Shark cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eight people sent me that picture," said Greg Jamison, the Sharks' chief 
operating officer. "That was obviously a very, very big thing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In their first season, playing at the dowdy Cow Palace in Daly City, the 
Sharks sold out their 40 home games. But they didn't merely take from the 
community: They established a program called Sharks and Parks, which provides 
street hockey equipment and instruction to local schools and recreation 
centers. By June, Jamison said, 30,000 kids will have been involved in the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamison joined the Sharks last September after 13 years with the Indiana 
Pacers and Dallas Mavericks. His job is to ensure the Sharks succeed after the 
attraction of a new arena and a "hot" color fade, as it inevitably will. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes things are novelties and wear off quickly. Sometimes they take 
hold, and we think this has taken hold," Jamison said. "The fact that it is San 
Jose's and Santa Clara County's (team) is a point of pride. Plus the fact that 
the arena is in the city, right downtown, lends itself to a strong sense of 
loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough winning only 11 games last year, so this year has been even more 
fun. I see people come out for the first time and like it. As one person told 
me, he brought somebody to a game, showed him how the blue line works, 
explained offside, and that's all you really need." 
</P>
<P>
 George Fraser knows hockey. He's a Detroit native -- "I grew up two blocks 
from Gordie Howe and I skated as a kid," he said -- and he's a Shark season 
ticket-holder. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a town that is starved for a sports identity," said Fraser, an 
insurance executive. "San Francisco has the Giants. Oakland has the A's. We 
have the Sharks now. This is big time." 
</P>
<P>
 The players enjoy that this-is-our-team feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning when I came here, you could go out and not be recognized. 
Now, everywhere you go at least one person recognizes you," Duchesne said. 
"It's nice. You can see we made a difference here, and people are starting to 
really like hockey now." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jamison: "We're looking to bring not only good hockey, but a flair to the 
presentation. The NHL puts a good, strong product on the ice from an 
entertainment standpoint. We need to continue to entertain, but the 
entertainment is never meant to overshadow the product. Sports marketing 
sometimes gets away from that. We want to enhance the product. We want people 
to say, 'I went to watch the San Jose Sharks play a hockey game. While I was 
there they gave away this and that and I really had a good time.' " 
</P>
<P>
 They have had good times and seen good hockey. The Sharks on Saturday rallied 
in the third period for a 4-3 victory over the favored Red Wings, tying their 
playoff series at 2-2. Irbe, who declared the fans' ruckus Friday "the loudest 
maybe in NHL history,' revised that estimate Saturday and will probably have to 
revise it yet again tonight, at the Tank. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really happy to play in front of this type of crowd," he said. "I think 
they recognize us not only as a nice-looking team but as a good team."

FULLERTON REPORTS MINOR INFRACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DIGIOVANNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cal State Fullerton athletic department has reported a minor NCAA 
infraction stemming from the administration's downsizing of the wrestling 
program in 1992, Athletic Director Bill Shumard said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 With limited funding available for wrestling after the departure of Coach Dan 
Lewis, Shumard said he told wrestlers that their scholarships were being 
reduced for the 1992-93 school year.But he failed to notify them in writing, a 
violation of NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The school also was required by the NCAA to inform wrestlers that they, upon 
request, would be provided a hearing to contest the reduction in aid. Fullerton 
finally made that offer in recent weeks, according to Dwayne Buth, a senior who 
reached the NCAA championships at 190 pounds this past season. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen wrestlers also received letters in March from Shumard, who offered to 
settle the scholarship dispute by giving each wrestler $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been advised that we technically don't owe the wrestlers anything, but 
I know how hard they've worked and suffered and came forth with what I thought 
was a good-faith gesture," Shumard said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the wrestlers, however, has signed the agreement. Buth said the team 
has retained a Beverly Hills attorney and is considering legal action against 
the school. MIKE DIGIOVANNA

IN AFTERMATH OF DRAFT, RAMS PLAN MEETINGS WITH FREE AGENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams completed their NFL draft Monday by selecting six players and then 
trading their final, sixth-round pick to Dallas for the Cowboys' 1995 
fourth-round pick. But the Rams' off-season work is far from finished. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're bringing in some veteran free agents," Ram Coach Chuck Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 After failing to trade for wide receiver Alvin Harper, the Rams are continuing 
to pursue free-agent wide receivers Haywood Jeffires of Houston and Greg 
McMurtry of New England. They contacted Jeffires' agent, Fred Joseph, Sunday 
about a new deal for the receiver, who two weeks ago rejected a three-year deal 
worth $3.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Free agents scheduled to visit Rams Park in the next few days are New England 
tight end Marv Cook and linebacker Joe Kelly, released by the Raiders last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are convinced their draft filled holes on the offensive line and 
secondary, added depth at running back and wide receiver and added speed to 
their special teams. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the Rams' 10 selections: FIRST ROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Gandy, offensive tackle, Auburn, 15th selection overall -- The Rams 
rated Gandy (6-feet-4 and 289 pounds) as one of their top offensive linemen 
along with Georgia's Bernard Williams. The coaches hope Gandy can step in right 
away at left tackle and protect oft-injured quarterback Chris Miller's 
blindside. A good pass blocker, Gandy's run-blocking is questionable even 
though Auburn running back James Bostic, the Rams' third-round selection, ran 
for 1,205 yards last season. "Wayne had tremendous productivity," said John 
Becker, Ram director of player personnel. "When I graded him, I don't remember 
him giving up a sack." Gandy's durability has been an asset -- he has started 
the last 31 games -- but there have been questions about the health of his 
lower back. Ram team doctors have examined Gandy and say there isn't a problem. 
SECOND ROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Isaac Bruce, wide receiver, Memphis State, 33rd overall -- The Rams bypassed 
Alabama's David Palmer because of his size (5 feet 7) and went with a bigger 
receiver in Bruce (6-0, 188 pounds). Bruce played two seasons at Santa Monica 
College before transferring to Memphis State, where he had an outstanding 
senior season, catching 74 passes for 1,054 yards and 10 touchdowns. He's 
considered a quick, agile receiver, although he is on the skinny and frail 
side. "Isaac is as quick as a cat," Ram receivers coach Steve Moore said. "I 
timed him at 4.47 in the 40-yard dash a month ago. He has grown a half-inch 
since the end of the season and has gained eight pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Toby Wright, safety, Nebraska, 49th overall -- The Rams were surprised to find 
Wright (5-11, 203 pounds) available at this pick, and they expect him to step 
in right away at strong safety, where they lost free-agent Michael Stewart to 
the Dolphins and Pat Terrell is an unrestricted free agent. Ram coaches also 
say Wright, considered one of the hardest hitters in the draft, can be 
effective in their nickel package on passing downs and on special teams. 
"Toby's temperament is along the lines of a Ronnie Lott," said Rod Perry, Ram 
defensive backs coach. "He's very, very physical and brings us toughness." 
Wright was an all-Big Eight selection last season, finishing with 79 tackles 
(43 solo). He has two brothers, Terry and Torrey, playing in the Canadian 
Football League. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Ottis, defensive end, Wayne State (Neb.), 56th overall pick -- You won't 
find Wayne, Neb., on some state maps. But the Rams think they found a quality 
defensive end playing at the Division II school in northeastern Nebraska. "All 
of our people were high on him," defensive coordinator George Dyer said. "Some 
people question him because he came out of a small conference, but I don't 
think that's a factor with Brad." The Rams needed depth at end with the 
departure of free-agent Tony Woods to the Washington Redskins, and look for 
Ottis (6-3, 271 pounds) to back up Fred Stokes and Robert Young while learning 
the ropes. THIRD ROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Lyle, safety, Virginia, 71st overall -- Knox said Lyle (6-2, 204) can 
play free safety or strong safety. He started two years at Virginia, finishing 
with five interceptions and 63 tackles (43 solo) last season. Lyle was ranked 
third among safeties by Mel Kiper Jr., three spots ahead of Nebraska's Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 James Bostic, running back, Auburn, 83rd overall -- The Rams are concerned 
about depth at running back because backup tailback-fullback David Lang 
underwent arthroscopic knee surgery last week and is expected to miss this 
week's minicamp. That concern prompted them to take Bostic, Gandy's Auburn 
teammate. Bostic (5-11, 222) can play fullback or tailback and will probably be 
Jerome Bettis' backup. Bostic is considered a good blocker and should help on 
special teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest Jones, outside linebacker, Oregon, 100th overall -- The Rams needed 
depth at outside linebacker and got it in Jones (6-2, 239), who was considered 
one of the top pass rushers in the West. Jones was an all-Pac 10 selection last 
season with 67 tackles (50 solo) and 13 sacks. Knox also figures Jones as a key 
player on the Rams' coverage teams. FOURTH ROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Brantley, wide receiver, Rutgers, 108th overall -- Brantley (5-11, 180) 
adds depth at receiver and could challenge as the team's punt returner. He set 
a school record with four touchdown catches in a 50-49 victory over Virginia 
Tech in 1992. "He has great hands and good speed, but not great track speed," 
Knox said. SIXTH ROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Rickey Brady, tight end, Oklahoma, 167th overall -- Brady (6-4, 246) will fill 
the role of blocking tight end vacated by free-agent Pat Carter, who signed 
with Houston. Brady will backup second-year player Troy Drayton and could be a 
key as the lead blocker on the Rams' sweep plays with Bettis. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Edwards, offensive tackle, North Carolina A&T, 189th overall -- Edwards 
(6-5, 311) is a project along the lines of guard Keith Loneker, whom the Rams 
signed as a free agent last season. Edwards is a raw talent from a Division 
I-AA school. He lacks speed and needs to improve his upper-body strength.

RAIDERS DRAFT; LINEBACKER QUESTION GETS ANSWERED IN A FLURRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders had never taken a linebacker in the first round of the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 The team not only broke that tradition, it went to the other extreme, 
selecting linebackers with three of its six picks to shore up a position that 
figured to be a trouble spot in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a seventh-round pick obtained from the Dallas Cowboys as a past 
consideration for last season's Elvis Patterson deal, the Raiders on Monday 
selected Rob Holmberg, a converted linebacker from Penn State who had formerly 
played wide receiver and tight end. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first two rounds of the draft, conducted on Sunday, the Raiders had 
selected linebackers Rob Fredrickson of Michigan State and James Folston of 
Northeast Louisiana. Although Folston is listed as a defensive lineman, the 
Raiders project him as a linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a position the Raiders needed to bolster even before putting middle 
linebacker Joe Kelly on waivers last week because of salary cap considerations. 
Winston Moss is still the clear standout there. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Art Shell acknowledged Monday that the status of running back Greg 
Robinson, who underwent reconstructive knee surgery in February, is uncertain 
for 1994. "The trainers have told us we may get him midway through the season," 
Shell said. "His rehab is going along very well. We're not counting on him. If 
we do get him, it's a plus." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Kansas City running back Harvey Williams agreed to a one-year deal late 
Saturday, and the Raiders added more depth at that position Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the second day of the Raiders' draft: THIRD ROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin Jones, running back, Nebraska, 5-11, 212 -- "He has great 
acceleration," Shell said. "We feel he is very good around the goal line and in 
short-yardage situations. And he does have the ability to catch the ball, 
(although) he hasn't been thrown the ball a whole lot." FOURTH ROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Austin Robbins, defensive lineman, North Carolina, 6-6, 300 -- Shell: "He's a 
4.9 (seconds in the 40-yard dash) guy. A defensive guy at 300 pounds who can 
run that fast, that tells you what he's capable of doing. We feel he can line 
up at the defensive end spot and learn how to play there." FIFTH ROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt Patterson, offensive lineman, Alabama, 6-3, 310 -- Shell: "Excellent 
feet. Good quickness. He comes off the ball with a pretty good explosion. The 
key ingredient here is that he has feet and he has size. You've got a 
combination of those things and a desire to excel, you've got a chance to make 
it at this level. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to turn him into a player. Right now, we're going to leave him at 
tackle." SEVENTH ROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Holmberg, linebacker, Penn State, 6-3, 225 -- Shell: "Speed. This guy can 
run. . . . We feel he's an outstanding project for us that we want to work with 
and try to turn him into an outstanding football player." Shell said Holmberg 
might be given a chance at tight end.

HE PROVES THAT FAME IS RELATIVE; PRO FOOTBALL: KLEIN, A FORMER L.A. PREP STAR 
WHO LEFT CAL FOR TINY C.W. POST, IS DRAFTED IN FOURTH ROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perry Klein, who seemed to have little chance of playing in the NFL after 
transferring from California to tiny C.W. Post for his senior season, was 
selected by the Atlanta Falcons on Monday in the fourth round of the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 The former All-City quarterback from Palisades and Carson high schools was the 
111th player selected. Heath Shuler of Tennessee and Trent Dilfer of Fresno 
State, both among the top six picks, were the only quarterbacks taken before 
Klein. Heisman Trophy winner Charlie Ward of Florida State was not picked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny how things work out sometimes," said Klein, who left Cal after 
three seasons as a backup before enjoying a record-breaking senior season at 
C.W. Post in Brookville, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 "People thought it was stupid for me to leave Cal, but I felt like the 
situation at Cal was a dead-end for me. I was really confident about my 
ability, but we had a coaching change (Keith Gilbertson replaced Bruce Snyder 
before Klein's junior season) and they wanted to go with a younger player 
(then-sophomore Dave Barr), and I got caught in that. It became a bad situation 
for me. I had to go somewhere where it was going to work, so that's what I did. 
And it turned out well." 
</P>
<P>
 Klein, 6 feet 3 and 210 pounds, passed for 3,757 yards and accounted for 4,052 
yards in total offense last season, both NCAA Division II records, leading C.W. 
Post to a 9-1 record and attracting the attention of NFL scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons, who use a run-and-shoot offense, liked Klein's ability in running 
a similar attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "He played in a spread-type offense, which makes him a natural for us," Falcon 
Coach June Jones told the Atlanta Journal and Constitution. "Believe me, the 
guy can throw it. In high school, he completed 46 of 49 once and, (speaking) as 
a former quarterback, you don't do that even throwing against air most days." 
</P>
<P>
 Klein, whose family lives in Malibu, worked out for Jones and assistant Mouse 
Davis, who coaches the Falcons' quarterbacks, on April 18 at Santa Monica 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would compare him favorably to (Ram quarterback) Chris Miller," Jones said. 
"He's got the same kind of physical tools. He's very accurate. He can stand in. 
I think the thing that gives him the edge over some of the other guys we looked 
at is his mobility. This is a guy who can make something happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Klein is thought to have a good chance to make the Falcons' roster as the No. 
3 quarterback because of salary-cap limitations. Starter Jeff George, acquired 
in a trade with the Indianapolis Colts, will earn about $2 million next season 
and backup Bobby Hebert will earn about $1 million. Southland Selections

RAMS DRAFT; DECISION 'UNANIMOUS' TO PASS ON QUARTERBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams completed their NFL draft Monday, but the topic of conversation 
remained their trades in Sunday's first round, when they passed on Fresno State 
quarterback Trent Dilfer with the fifth pick and failed to trade for Dallas 
wide receiver Alvin Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram Coach Chuck Knox strongly denied Monday that the coaches and front office 
couldn't decide what route to take Sunday with the fifth pick -- select Dilfer, 
trade for Harper or trade down for Indianapolis' seventh pick and later San 
Francisco's 15th pick, which they eventually used to select Auburn offensive 
tackle Wayne Gandy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was absolutely no disagreement at any time about the course of action 
we were going to pursue," Knox said. "There was none, absolutely none. . . . As 
far as the decision that was made, it was a unanimous decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox had said Wednesday that the Rams would draft Dilfer or Tennessee 
quarterback Heath Shuler if one or both were available at No. 5. But Sunday, 
Knox said the Rams "had a change of heart" and traded down to pick up an extra 
third-round pick from Indianapolis and a second-round pick from San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 When did the change of heart take place? 
</P>
<P>
 "It took place in the period where we were involved in the Harper deal and 
thought we had it done at No. 5," Knox said. "Then we were going to get it done 
at No. 7. It was in that period that we made the decision. We decided we wanted 
to back up and get some draft choices." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams used San Francisco's second-round selection (56th overall) to take 
defensive end Brad Ottis of Wayne State College, a Division II school in 
northeast Nebraska. They used Indianapolis' third-round pick Monday to take 
running back James Bostic, Gandy's Auburn teammate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have also reopened negotiations with Houston free agent receiver 
Haywood Jeffires, who had rejected a three-year, $3.9-million offer from the 
Rams two weeks ago. New England tight end Marv Cook and linebacker Joe Kelly, 
cut last week by the Raiders, are scheduled to visit Rams Park this week. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the second day of the Rams' draft: THIRD ROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Lyle, safety, Virginia, 6-2, 204 -- Knox said Lyle can play free safety 
or strong safety. He started two years at Virginia, finishing with five 
interceptions and 63 tackles (43 solo) last season. 
</P>
<P>
 James Bostic, running back, Auburn, 5-11, 222 -- The Rams are concerned about 
depth at running back because backup tailback-fullback David Lang underwent 
arthroscopic knee surgery last week and is expected to sit out this week's 
mini-camp. That concern prompted them to take Bostic, who will be reunited with 
Gandy. Bostic can play fullback or tailback and will probably be Jerome Bettis' 
backup. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest Jones, outside linebacker, Oregon, 6-2, 239 -- The Rams needed depth at 
outside linebacker and got it in Jones, who was considered one of the top pass 
rushers in the West. Jones was an all-Pacific 10 selection last season with 67 
tackles (50 solo) and 13 sacks. Knox figures Jones as a key player on coverage 
teams. FOURTH ROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Brantley, wide receiver, Rutgers, 5-11, 180 -- Brantley adds depth at 
receiver and could challenge as the team's punt returner. He set a school 
record with four touchdown catches in a 50-49 victory over Virginia Tech in 
1992. "He has great hands and good speed, but not great track speed," Knox 
said. SIXTH ROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Rickey Brady, tight end, Oklahoma, 6-4, 246 -- Brady will fill the role of 
blocking tight end vacated by free agent Pat Carter, who signed with Houston. 
Brady will back up second-year player Troy Drayton and could be a key as the 
lead blocker on sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Edwards, offensive tackle, North Carolina A&T, 6-5, 311 -- Edwards is a 
project along the lines of guard Keith Loneker, whom the Rams signed as a free 
agent last season. Edwards is a raw talent from a Division I-AA school.

NFL CLOSES ITS LOOPHOLE ON REPORTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHERWA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ambiguity in an NFL policy that allowed a reporter to be barred from 
Raider training camp last season is being removed, according to Commissioner 
Paul Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Noland, a reporter for the Daily News of Los Angeles, was barred from the 
Raiders' camp in Oxnard because the team believed his coverage was negative. 
</P>
<P>
 "The policy was ambiguous," Tagliabue said. "But that loophole is being closed 
and the matter is resolved. We're going to spell it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Tagliabue, meeting with a group of sports editors to discuss media issues, 
explained the Raiders' action this way: "The Raiders have historically had a 
policy of club prerogative that is unique." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have long had a stormy relationship with the NFL, and the Raiders' 
constant threat of moving has been perplexing to the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday (at the NFL draft), I wanted to announce that for the 22nd pick in 
the draft, the Raiders have selected Orlando," Tagliabue said. "Just to see if 
everyone was on their toes." JOHN CHERWA

VALLEY / VENTURA ROUNDUP; STROH SAYS 1994 FOOTBALL SEASON WILL BE HIS LAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Area coaching legend Darryl Stroh, who led Granada Hills High to a total of 
six City Section titles in two major sports, will call it quits in football 
following the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Stroh, 55, the Highlanders have won five major-division City baseball 
titles and another in football. Stroh said the grind of being a two-sport coach 
finally wore him down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just too much (of a commitment)," he said Monday. "I don't want to be 
spending my whole life at school anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 In City coaching circles, Stroh's accomplishments put him among the elite. 
</P>
<P>
 He won a 4-A Division football title in 1987 when the Highlanders shocked 
Carson, which was ranked second in the nation. Granada Hills won City baseball 
championships in 1975, 1976, 1978, 1979 and 1984 during Stroh's 25 years as 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this will help make me a better baseball coach," said Stroh, who 
plans to continue coaching baseball indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from his credentials on the field, Stroh was just as storied for his 
frankness, work ethic and integrity, his colleagues said. In the fall, Stroh 
would coach football on Friday night, then get up early the following morning 
for off-season baseball games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a loss," said football Coach Bob Francola of Kennedy, 
Granada Hills' archrival. "Our competition on the football field is something 
I've always looked forward to. 
</P>
<P>
 "He stands for a lot of good things. He'll be missed." 
</P>
<P>
 Stroh has been involved with Highlander sports for as long as he can remember. 
Stroh did his student teaching at Granada Hills in 1962 and has been on the 
football staff in some capacity ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Stroh said he announced his resignation in the spring so that the school would 
have plenty of time to fill his vacant position -- whether it's one position or 
two remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Football co-Coach Tom Harp, 40, who has spent the past 10 varsity seasons on 
the sideline with Stroh, said he also is undecided whether he will return after 
next fall. Harp also coaches boys' volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coaching wears on you after a while," Harp said. STEVE ELLING

 Jason Medearis of Hart High, one of the top hurdlers in the state, signed a 
national letter of intent with the University of Wyoming on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Medearis took recruiting trips to Wyoming and Montana -- and was offered full 
scholarships to each -- before choosing the Western Athletic Conference school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches were real cool and I like the campus," Medearis said. "The 
academics will fit me well out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches from Purdue, Colorado and Arizona State spoke to Medearis in recent 
weeks about making trips to their campuses, but he declined. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought about taking my last three trips to those schools, but I just 
wanted to get this over with," Medearis said. "I'm happy with my decision." 
</P>
<P>
 A wide receiver and defensive back in football, Medearis will compete only in 
track in college. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few schools such as (Northern Arizona) recruited me for both football and 
track, but I made a decision to focus on one sport," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Medearis has personal bests of 14.12 seconds in the 110-meter high hurdles and 
37.42 in the 300 intermediates. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished second in the intermediates and third in the highs in last year's 
Southern Section Division I championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Haslip of Pasadena Muir, the defending state champion in the 
intermediates, is the only hurdler in the state to defeat Medearis this season.

 Cathy Prater of Agoura High, the third-place finisher in the girls' 300-meter 
low hurdles in last year's state championships, said Monday that she plans to 
run track for UC Davis next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Prater took recruiting trips to Arkansas, Oregon and UC Davis before deciding 
to attend the NCAA Division II school, which does not offer athletic 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything just felt right when I went there," Prater said. "I like the fact 
that Davis is a little closer to home than the other schools. I like the fact 
it's a college town and I like the fact that academically the school is very 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 Prater recently ruled out Arkansas as one of her final choices, but turning 
down Oregon and an opportunity to compete in front of its devout track fans was 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody there loves track," she said. "I mean, there aren't many schools 
who sell season tickets to track meets. . . . But I just felt like I'd feel 
more comfortable at a Division II school. I just feel like there will be less 
pressure on me to excel right away. At the Division I level, they kind of own 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Prater has a personal best of 44.45 seconds in the 300 hurdles, she 
is also a talented distance runner. She finished fourth in last year's Ventura 
County cross-country championships even though it was her first season 
competing in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely plan on running cross-country for them," she said. "I really 
enjoyed myself last season and I want to continue." JOHN ORTEGA

ORGANIZATION A MUST IN EX-MARINE'S OFFICE; PROFILE: LONGTIME SECRETARY TO O.C. 
SUPERVISOR THOMAS F. RILEY PLANS HER TIME AND ENVIRONMENT WITH PRECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When your boss is a retired Marine Corps officer, the key to success is to run 
the office with military precision. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara M. Rier, longtime secretary to Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. 
Riley, says it doesn't hurt, either, that she is a compulsive list maker and 
self-styled efficiency expert. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very organized by nature," Rier said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Indispensable" is the word Riley uses to describe her. The 81-year-old 
supervisor, who retired from the Marine Corps as a general and is leaving the 
Board of Supervisors this year after 20 years of service, suggests that his 
secretary's organizational skills match his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Her secret, Rier says, is using her time wisely. She rises at 5 a.m. and is in 
the office by 7 -- the only way to be ready for the challenges of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 As the person who receives most visitors to Riley's office on the fifth floor 
of the Hall of Administration in Santa Ana, Rier has constant interruptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be able to have the phone ringing, have someone (waiting) in the 
office and a staff member coming to my desk. You have to do everything at 
once," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To stay organized, Rier keeps a "to do" list attached to her desk calendar. A 
separate list keeps track of her personal appointments, which range from 
attending the opera to bodybuilding sessions that keep her looking younger than 
her 47 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for her telephones and calendars, though, Rier's desktop is clear, 
sending a subtle message of efficiency to people who drop in. 
</P>
<P>
 The way to maintain order, she says, is to have a place for everything and not 
to let clutter accumulate. She keeps items that she uses frequently -- paper 
clips, scissors, rubber bands -- at arm's length. To snare a rubber band, for 
example, she simply reaches over to the credenza. 
</P>
<P>
 Office supplies that are used less frequently are stored farther away. 
</P>
<P>
 Rier confesses that she occasionally crams papers into desk drawers during 
particularly busy moments. But she sets things straight in a matter of days, if 
not hours, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 And she thrives on the bustle: "I work better under pressure."

JUMP IN HOME RESALES HITS 7-YEAR HIGH; REAL ESTATE: A SCRAMBLE TO LOCK IN 
MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES IS CITED IN THE 31.3% RISE IN CALIFORNIA OVER A YEAR 
AGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A rush to lock in lower mortgage rates, coupled with reawakening consumer 
confidence, dramatically boosted sales of existing homes in California in 
March, easing immediate fears that the recent rise in interest rates will stall 
the state's nascent economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Home sales last month jumped 31.3% compared to March, 1993, the 10th 
consecutive monthly increase and the largest rise in seven years, according to 
a report released Monday by the California Assn. of Realtors. Nationally, 
existing home sales rose 18.4% in March compared to a year ago, to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 4.06 million units.  
</P>
<P>
 The results prompted some economists to predict that home sales in 1994 will 
hit near-record levels nationally, despite increases in fixed-rate mortgages of 
more than 1.5 percentage points since last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 However, several economists were more cautious, noting that it is still too 
early to gauge the full impact of rising interest rates on the nation's and 
state's housing markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real test is still ahead," said Gary Schlossberg, vice president and 
senior economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. "The latest figures 
provide only a snapshot of the past, not necessarily a glimpse of future. We 
believe that the interest rate increases certainly won't kill the housing 
recovery, but it could be weaker than we had projected earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, for the third time this year, the Federal Reserve Board raised its 
federal funds rate -- the rate banks charge each other on overnight loans -- to 
keep the national economy from overheating. As a result, banks and other 
lenders have made corresponding increases in consumer interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the average 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage in the United States 
rose to 7.68% in March from 7.15% in February, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corp. said, adding approximately $50 to the monthly mortgage payment of a 
typically priced home nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America predicted that the average 30-year 
mortgage will climb to 8.90% by the end of the year and increase to 9.15% in 
1995. The rate now stands at about 8.55%. 
</P>
<P>
 Several analysts noted that many potential home buyers were pushed off the 
fence when mortgage rates, which reached their lowest level in a generation in 
October, began to rise markedly in February. With buyers seeking to lock in 
lower rates, sales in March surged. 
</P>
<P>
 The realty organization reported that 510,590 existing, single-family detached 
homes in California closed escrow during March on a seasonally adjusted annual 
basis -- up 0.9% from a revised rate of 506,270 homes sold in February. The 
annualized figure represents the total number of homes that would be sold 
during 1994 if sales occurred at the March pace throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, where housing remains far more expensive than the rest of the 
country, the median price of an existing, single-family detached home in March 
was $183,840, up 1.6% from a revised $180,980 in February. The median price is 
the point at which half the homes sold for more and half for less. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, sales of existing homes rose 5.7% in March to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 4.06 million units, compared to a revised rate of 3.84 
million in February. The national median price of all homes sold in March was 
$107,400, up from $106,900 in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Some economists also attributed the national sales increase to a catch-up 
following a harsh winter throughout much of the nation. But in California, 
where the weather was dry and warm this winter, economists cited increased 
consumer confidence and an improved economy for the resale surge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy is growing and people are becoming more confident about their 
jobs and their income," said David Berson, chief economist for the Federal 
National Mortgage Assn. "There's a boomlet under way in California, and the 
state should get even stronger for at least the next two years while the 
earthquake rebuilding continues." 
</P>
<P>
 Berson said newfound consumer confidence in the nation -- as well as 
California -- is clearly a factor, because both housing prices and mortgage 
rates were lower within the last six months and housing sales remained stalled. 
"Rates can be low," he said, "and people won't buy if they don't feel 
confident." California Home Sales

LAWYER AWARDED $23.1 MILLION IN GUESS SUIT; COURTS: PANEL ORDERS MARCIANO 
BROTHERS TO PAY MARSHALL B. GROSSMAN, WHO REPRESENTED THEM IN BATTLE FOR 
COMPANY. 
</P>

 Call it sweet revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 For five years, all-star Los Angeles attorney Marshall B. Grossman represented 
the mercurial Marciano brothers in their savage legal combat for control of 
Guess, the phenomenally successful jeans company that has been the brothers' 
backdrop for one pitched battle after another -- with investors and among 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 With the prize at hand -- a negotiated settlement that stripped rival 
Jordache's owners of their 51% interest in Guess -- the Marcianos summarily 
dumped Grossman, paraded into court in May, 1990, with other high-priced 
litigators and declared that they would not pay Grossman the $10-million bounty 
they'd promised if he got them their company back. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman will announce today that a panel of Los Angeles County Bar Assn. 
arbitrators has awarded him and his partners a huge, if belated, payday from 
the Marcianos: $17 million in legal fees, including the bounty, plus millions 
more in interest for a total of $23.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman was seeking $34 million. Still, the sum he collected following six 
months of testimony is the biggest award in the history of the Los Angeles 
County Bar Assn.'s process for resolving fee disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the four Marciano brothers are enmeshed in a fresh set of 
squabbles. Georges, the designer, sold his interest last year in Guess -- Los 
Angeles' biggest garment maker -- and now is suing his brothers over use of the 
family name. 
</P>
<P>
 But the arbitration award, everyone agrees, closes the book on the decade of 
lawsuits, countersuits, investigations, counter-investigations and unbridled 
name calling spawned by the Marcianos' decision to sell a half-interest in 
their hot -- but undercapitalized -- company to the Nakash brothers of Jordache 
back in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Marcianos are pleased with the arbitration result," said Century City 
attorney Dale F. Kinsella, who represented the brothers in the dispute over 
Grossman's legal fee. Indeed, they have already paid as ordered. "The matter is 
behind them, as far as they are concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 That stance was a long time coming. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marcianos and Nakashes slugged it out in proceedings that crisscrossed the 
globe, from Hong Kong to Los Angeles to New York to France. In essence, the 
Nakashes contended that the Marcianos suffered sellers' remorse for giving up 
half of Guess for just $5 million. The Marcianos accused the Nakashes of fraud 
in making the investment. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Grossman and his Century City firm, Alschuler, Grossman & Pines, won 
a jury verdict for the Marcianos. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, as a second jury deliberated what damages to award the 
Marcianos, the brothers announced a settlement with the Nakashes. Georges, 
Paul, Maurice and Armand Marciano would get back their company, and the New 
York-based owners of Jordache would pay them a reported $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman, the brothers said, could take a hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Marciano, the force behind Guess' distinctive advertising, charged that 
Grossman wanted to secure his bounty -- and satisfy his ego -- by holding out 
for a jury verdict in the second trial. The brothers came to court wearing 
buttons bearing the name of lawyer-to-the-stars Howard Weitzman, who 
represented the Nakashes, and vowed not to pay the $10-million fee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The pain was horrific," recalled Grossman, who is more accustomed to 
unvarnished victory. He successfully defended Liberace in a palimony suit, for 
instance, and helped the Coliseum Commission stop the Raiders football team 
from leaving town. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pain is still there," he said. "To that extent, the recovery of the funds 
is not a full victory." 
</P>
<P>
 In the arbitration, the Marcianos alleged that the fee agreement put the 
interests of Grossman's firm ahead of their own. Beyond the bounty, the package 
promised 20% of whatever damages the Nakashes paid and possibly millions of 
dollars more -- depending on how the deal was interpreted. 
</P>
<P>
 Befitting the litigiousness of the whole affair, transcripts of the 
arbitration ran to 15,000 pages, and the lawyers offered more than 800 
exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kinsella: "A fair reading of the overall record is that serious questions 
were presented on these matters." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Grossman: "The Marcianos accused us of everything other than inventing 
the rack and screw." He plans to set up a charitable foundation with some of 
the proceeds from the settlement.

VONS LURES 2 EXECUTIVES AWAY FROM RIVAL LUCKY; SUPERMARKETS: LAWRENCE DEL SANTO 
AND RICHARD GOODSPEED ARE NAMED TO HIGH POSTS AT SOUTHLAND'S MAJOR STORE CHAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Vons Cos. scored a coup Monday against chief rival Lucky Stores by naming two 
executives from Lucky's parent company to help head Southern California's 
largest supermarket chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Del Santo, 60, senior executive vice president and chief operating 
officer of food operations at Salt Lake City-based American Stores, will become 
Von's vice chairman and chief executive beginning today. Del Santo's television 
commercials for Lucky have made him a familiar figure in many Southland homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard E. Goodspeed, 57, executive vice president of food operations at 
American Stores, was named new president and chief operating officer at Vons, 
replacing Dennis K. Eck, who resigned last November. 
</P>
<P>
 Vons Chairman Roger Stangeland relinquishes his position as chief executive to 
Del Santo. Vons said Del Santo will also succeed Stangeland as chairman in May, 
1995. Stangeland, who has also been functioning as chief operating officer 
since Eck's departure, will be 65 in October and plans to retire next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is considered a feather in the cap for Vons, which launched a 
restructuring plan in November designed to help the company cope with declining 
1993 sales in the competitive Southland market. Vons, in a bid to compete with 
low-price rivals such as Food 4 Less and Lucky, also announced a price-cutting 
program in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Vons has been the supermarket leader in Southern California, with about 19% of 
the Southland market in 1993, according to Progressive Grocer magazine. Lucky 
and Ralphs both had market shares of about 14% last year, according to 
Progressive Grocer. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcadia-based Vons operates 331 Vons, Pavilions, Tianguis and EXPO stores in 
Southern California and 15 stores in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 American Stores operates 439 Lucky stores in California and Las Vegas, 
including 222 Lucky stores in Southern California. Its Lucky Stores unit is 
based in the San Francisco Bay Area city of Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Santo and Goodspeed will be responsible for Vons' day-to-day operations. 
Del Santo began his career at Vons in 1957 and became president of the company 
in 1970. In 1974, he was named executive vice president of Household 
Merchandising -- Vons' parent company at that time -- and held that position 
until he joined Lucky Stores in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, American Stores on Monday announced that Robert P. Hermanns, 50, 
formerly the company's executive vice president and general manager for new 
business development, has succeeded Del Santo as senior vice president of food 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 American Stores said Goodspeed will not be replaced because the company is 
changing its management structure. 
</P>
<P>
 American operates a total of 1,695 stores in 27 states, including the 
Anaheim-based Sav-on drugstore chain.

BLUE CHIPS SOAR 57.10 AS BOND YIELDS PLUNGE; MARKETS: STRONG CORPORATE EARNINGS 
REPORTS HELP IGNITE THE BROAD ADVANCE. DUPONT REPORTS 29% QUARTERLY EARNINGS 
GROWTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Stocks shot higher Monday for the second time in three sessions, buoyed by a 
surprise plunge in long-term interest rates and by healthy corporate earnings 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average soared 57.10 points to 3,705.78, its highest 
close since March 28. Rising stocks outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 on 
the New York Stock Exchange, although trading was typically slow for a Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, a rush of buy orders pulled the yield on the Treasury's 
benchmark 30-year bond from 7.22% on Friday to 7.15% by Monday's close -- the 
lowest since March 31 and well below the peak yield of 7.42% set April 18. 
</P>
<P>
 But many traders warned that the frenzy for bonds appeared to be fueled by 
"technical" factors, not a change in most investors' expectations about 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said news that financial markets will be closed Wednesday in memory of 
former President Richard M. Nixon spurred bond buying on the part of "short" 
sellers anxious to cover their positions. 
</P>
<P>
 In a short sale, a trader borrows bonds and sells them, expecting their prices 
to drop (and thus their yields to rise) further in the near term. If the bet is 
correct, the trader can buy bonds later at cheaper prices to replace the 
borrowed securities previously sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the government will report on first-quarter gross domestic product 
Thursday, some short sellers decided to cover their positions Monday by buying 
bonds, in case first-quarter growth is slower than expected. A weak number 
could cause interest rates to continue to fall -- the opposite bet of bond 
short sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 With an unexpected holiday Wednesday, short sellers suddenly had one less day 
this week to decide how to approach the GDP report. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond pros' disappointment with Monday's rally stemmed from the perceived lack 
of institutional buying. The preponderance of activity by short sellers means 
that "we did not have quality buyers in the market," said William Sullivan, 
economist at Dean Witter Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 If institutional investors, such as mutual funds, were buying bonds, it could 
indicate the market's belief that the recent surge in long-term interest rates 
has been overdone.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, some analysts noted that it's impossible to measure the precise extent 
of institutional buying. 
</P>
<P>
 A major test of investors' expectations for interest rates will come today, 
when the Treasury auctions $17 billion in two-year notes. On Thursday, the 
Treasury will sell $11 billion in five-year notes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, meanwhile, position covering by short sellers also helped 
drive prices higher Monday. But Wall Street also appeared genuinely impressed 
with the latest batch of first-quarter corporate earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
 DuPont, for example, surged 3 1/2 to 58 1/8 after the chemical giant reported 
that its first-quarter net grew 29%. Other earnings winners included Clark 
Equipment, up 9 1/8 to 66 5/8, and chewing gum king Wrigley, up 2 1/8 to 52. 
</P>
<P>
 "DuPont's earnings had a big effect on the market," said Guy Truicko, equity 
portfolio manager at Unity Management. "They were blowout, and you're getting a 
bounce back in cyclical names." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Dow's 1.6% gain was far greater than most other stock indexes, 
analysts noted that the market overall was strong. The Nasdaq composite index 
of mostly smaller stocks jumped 8.24 points, or 1.1%, to 730.80. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * DuPont's impressive earnings drew buyers back to industrial stocks. Gainers 
included GM, up 1 5/8 to 57 1/4; International Paper, up 1 5/8 to 62 5/8; 
Caterpillar, up 3 1/4 to 111 1/8, and Kennametal, up 1 1/2 to 52 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many tech stocks also surged. Intel gained 2 5/8 to 62 7/8, Apple Computer 
rose 1 1/4 to 31 and Microsoft surged 2 to 93 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oil stocks leaped as crude prices inched higher. Chevron jumped 2 3/8 to 92 
5/8, Mobil gained 1 5/8 to 80 and Unocal surged 1 3/8 to 28 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, U.S. Healthcare slumped 4 1/2 to 38 3/4 after posting 
first-quarter earnings of 55 cents a share, compared to. 39 cents a year 
earlier. The results were below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, arbitrage-linked selling during the morning session forced Tokyo 
stocks to end the day lower. The Nikkei average closed down 255.25 points at 
19,709.14. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks also closed lower in London, with the FTSE-100 ending at 3,106.1, down 
27.6 points. Frankfurt's DAX index fell 11.7 points to 2,202.22. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets, rising violence in South Africa pushed gold prices up $2.80 
to $373.40 an ounce on the Comex in New York. Silver added 6 cents to close at 
$5.13 an ounce.

POLITICAL MORASS COULD TRAP JAPAN'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY; LEADERSHIP: A SPLIT IN 
THE HOURS-OLD COALITION GOVERNMENT SENDS THE TOKYO STOCK MARKET LOWER AS 
INVESTORS LOSE CONFIDENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The political chaos that hit Japan's government early today, just 12 hours 
after the election of new Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, may derail an expected 
economic recovery and lead to worsening trade friction with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Much depends, however, on how long the collapse of Hata's ruling coalition 
delays policy-making. The risk of stalemate is also balanced, to some degree, 
by the possibility that current upheavals will eventually bring a more stable 
political structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting investors' fears, the Tokyo stock market's Nikkei index fell 158.53 
points, or 0.8%, to 19,550.61 in early-morning trading today. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors "had bought the dream of a return to efficient government led by a 
stable coalition and a prime minister who is very pragmatic," said Jesper Koll, 
an analyst with S.G. Warburg Securities. "And you are now short somewhere 
around 60 votes of a majority (for Hata's government). Minority governments are 
inherently unstable. . . . You have the knee-jerk reaction in the stock 
market." 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition that elected Hata split into conservative and leftist factions 
early today. Angered by the sudden formation of a parliamentary "bargaining 
group" by several coalition parties, Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama 
announced at 1:22 a.m. today that his party would leave the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama said his party would help pass a budget for fiscal 1994, which began 
April 1, but would no longer be bound by any other policy agreements with other 
coalition parties. Passage of the budget, which contains some measures designed 
to stimulate Japan's stagnant economy, is considered the most basic 
prerequisite to encourage renewed economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 But much more active market-opening and economic-stimulus measures will be 
needed to address trade disputes with the United States in the face of Clinton 
Administration threats to impose retaliatory trade sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan has pledged to produce by June a program to "substantially" reduce its 
$141-billion global trade surplus, including a $60-billion surplus with the 
United States. New action to stimulate economic growth, thereby pulling in more 
foreign goods through an increase in domestic demand, is a key element of what 
has been expected. But it is no longer clear that Hata's government will have 
the time or the political strength to focus on these issues before that 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "The promise of clarity over the fiscal stance has been shattered," Koll said. 
"You've got a government that is less likely to produce a permanent tax cut, as 
desired by the U.S. government, before the July Naples summit" of the G-7 major 
industrial democracies. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll also noted that pressure for a stronger yen may resume if other steps to 
cut Japan's huge trade surplus are ineffective. A strong yen makes Japanese 
exports more expensive -- and less competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 A political upheaval had been feared for months, but many had hoped that the 
election of Hata would usher in at least a few months of relative calm. Now the 
possibilities range from a quick political realignment that still gives Hata a 
working majority to a dissolution of the lower house of Parliament and general 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Young, an analyst at Salomon Bros. Asia Ltd., said the stock market 
did not show a greater reaction to the coalition's collapse because "no one 
expected the left-wing Socialists to stay in the coalition forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor, he said, is that political realignment is likely to bring "a 
more stable system" once another general election is held, which could be this 
year or next.

BOLSA INDEX DROPS 18.2 ON 2ND KIDNAPING; MEXICO: ABDUCTION OF WEALTHY 
BUSINESSMAN TRIGGERS ANOTHER STOCK MARKET DECLINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The abduction Monday of a second wealthy Mexican in six weeks sent shivers 
through the Mexican business community Monday and deflated an early stock rally 
triggered by a stronger peso. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bolsa index closed down 18.23 points at 2,191.08 after falling back from a 
session high of 2,289.60 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The narrower INMEX index also closed lower, but advancing shares outnumbered 
declines 40 to 38 in the wider market. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market is extremely sensitive to bad news like the kidnaping of Angel 
Losada of Grupo Gigante, piled on top of other events," said analyst Jose 
Alanis at the brokerage Arka. 
</P>
<P>
 Losada, the vice chairman of Gigante and son of the chairman, also sits on the 
board of Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival, whose chairman, Alfredo Harp Helu, 
was kidnaped last month outside his Mexico City home. Harp is still being held 
by unknown abductors. 
</P>
<P>
 Losada, reported to be in his 40s, was grabbed by several armed men at midday 
as he drove in an affluent neighborhood of Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market had been buoyed earlier by the peso's firmness, expectations 
of easier short-term interest rates at this week's treasury bill auction and 
good first-quarter results from heavily weighted Telefonos de Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 But "news of the kidnaping revived the sense of uncertainty, and many 
investors took profits on the market's recent gains," a trader said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the two kidnapings, investors have been concerned about the 
peasant rebellion in southern Mexico and the still unexplained assassination in 
late March of the ruling party's presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 Gigante B shares led the losers, ending down 7 cents at 56 cents.

CALIFORNIA FEDERAL REPORTS FIRST-QUARTER LOSS OF $326.3 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing continuing ills of Southern California's real estate market, California 
Federal Bank on Monday reported a net loss of $326.3 million for the first 
quarter ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of $11.53 per share includes CalFed's previously announced charge of 
$280 million from the bulk sale of about $1 billion in non-performing and 
performing loans.It contrasts with earnings of $10.5 million, or 40 cents per 
share, for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 CalFed executives said that despite the results, their efforts to restore the 
thrift to health are proceeding well. Completion of the loan sales over the 
next three months will enable the S&L's management to "focus additional energy 
on the operating side of the business," said Edward G. Harshfield, president 
and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the results were unsurprising, given the thrift's announcement 
as early as February of the loan sales and expected charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been communicating the loss for quite a long time," said Campbell K. 
Chaney, an analyst for Dakin Securities in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Another analyst, however, said the institution's loss continues to demonstrate 
that CalFed is "a hostage to Los Angeles real estate." 
</P>
<P>
 "They have no diversification, no control over what their portfolio is worth," 
said Kenneth Frankel, analyst at Drake Capital Securities in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The sales are part of CalFed's effort to cut its portfolio of non-performing 
assets to 1.98% of total. The ratio at the end of the first quarter was 4.87%, 
down from 5.26% at the end of December, it said.

STATE ASKED TO ROLL BACK MILK PRICE HIKE; PETITION: CONSUMERS UNION CALLS LAST 
YEAR'S BOOST IN PRICES PAID FARMERS UNJUSTIFIED. IT SAYS THE POOR ARE BEING 
HURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Consumers Union, the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, asked 
state regulators on Monday to reverse a decision of last November that resulted 
in retail milk price increases of up to 30 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers Union, in a petition filed with the California Department of Food 
and Agriculture, said there was no justification for the department-ordered 
increase in what dairy farmers are paid for milk. Consumers Union said that 
milk production costs have remained fairly stable and consumer demand for milk 
has declined, factors that argue against a price increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers Union's petition is unusual, coming from outside the dairy industry 
and asking the department to take the rare action of reversing itself. Previous 
petitions have come from dairy farmers or milk processors, a group that 
includes major supermarket chains. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that the CDFA has undertaken to set producer (milk) prices without 
relationship to demand, without reference to what it costs to produce milk, and 
without regard to the needs of California milk drinkers," the petition said. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase will cost Californians $155 million a year, an outlay that is 
especially burdensome to poor families, Consumers Union said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Department of Food and Agriculture said the agency had 
not received the petition and could not comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Voss, director of the agency, has 30 days to either reject the petition 
or accept it and order a hearing. The director has accepted nine of 17 
milk-pricing petitions submitted since November, 1989, but has not been asked 
to reverse a prior decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The department sets raw milk prices but does not regulate retail milk prices. 
However, gains in raw milk prices are almost always passed on to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to a request from dairy farmers, the department last November 
approved a 14% hike in raw milk prices. The department said it acted because 
half the state's dairy farmers were not covering their costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The increases were phased in over two months, boosting retail prices in Los 
Angeles and San Francisco by an average of 20 cents a gallon and as much as 30 
cents a gallon. In Los Angeles, retail milk prices rose above $3 a gallon for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers Union said the cost of producing milk was slightly higher in 1993 
than in 1992, but below what it cost to produce in 1990, when farmers' costs 
peaked. The retail price of a gallon of milk in Los Angeles was about $2.33 in 
1990, significantly less than now. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Western United Dairymen, the organization of dairy farmers 
that sought the price increase, could not be reached for comment. But dairy 
farmers in the past have argued that supermarkets are making huge profits on 
milk and could absorb increases in raw milk prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dairy Institute, an organization representing milk processors, had no 
comment on Consumers Union's petition. Institute Director Craig Alexandar said 
it was unclear how higher prices had affected retail milk sales. Milk sales 
were flat in January, rose in February and are expected to be down in March, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer advocates have argued that because there is no substitute for milk, 
people continue to buy it despite rising prices. Consumers Union said the price 
increases are especially hard on poor families, who are forced to allocate a 
greater share of their food budget to milk. Many doctors consider milk 
important to children's health. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Lynch, program director at the San Francisco Food Bank, said the boost in 
milk prices has strained the budgets of some agencies that serve the poor. He 
said that the Casa de las Madres battered women's shelter has had to substitute 
less-expensive powdered milk.

 IBM Chairman Predicts Profit for '94: Louis V. Gerstner Jr., presiding over 
his second IBM annual meeting, told shareholders that "barring the unforeseen, 
we are planning on being profitable in 1994." The meeting was far less 
confrontational than last year's, when IBM's stock had fallen from $100 to 
about $48. The Armonk, N.Y.-based company has since accelerated its cost 
cutting, leading it to post a modest $392-million profit and a 6% jump in 
revenue on continuing operations for the first quarter.

 Judge Orders Trustee for Cannon: U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Lisa Hill Fenning in 
Los Angeles ordered an interim trustee to operate independent distributor 
Cannon Pictures. Last week, a group of creditors filed an involuntary 
bankruptcy petition to liquidate Cannon, claiming they are owed more than $6 
million. In addition, French bank Credit Lyonnais, which is not part of that 
creditors group, says it is owed about $20 million.

 Bid for America West Retained: An investment group will continue with its 
$245-million bid to buy America West Airlines after agreeing to new bidding 
provisions. The new agreement allows AmWest Partners to seek Bankruptcy Court 
approval for compensation up to $4 million if the Phoenix-based carrier, 
operating under Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Court protection, selects another offer. 
Last week, AmWest Partners said it might drop the bid after the Bankruptcy 
Court opposed a proposal that would have awarded the investment group up to $8 
million in break-up fees.

because of fewer commercial airplane deliveries, the aerospace company said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Net earnings were $292 million, or 86 cents per share, for the quarter ended 
March 31, compared to earnings of $325 million, or 96 cents per share, last 
year. Sales for the first three months were $6.3 billion, down from $6.6 
billion a year ago.

 The Seattle-based company delivered 82 commercial jets, compared to 93 in the 
first quarter of 1993. It still projects a 1994 total of 206 plane deliveries 
and $21 billion in sales.

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: THE SPORTS MEMORABILIA PHENOMENON PLAYS ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A toothy kid stares in awe as hockey legend Wayne Gretzky autographs a hockey 
puck for him. Swell guy this Gretzky must be, huh? 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a second. This is an advertisement. And the small print under this ad in 
the latest sports memorabilia catalogue from Upper Deck Authenticated explains 
that it'll cost you $299 for Gretzky to personalize that puck for your kid's 
birthday. And football great Joe Montana will scratch a personal Father's Day 
message across a football to anyone willing to kick in $379. 
</P>
<P>
 These "personalized" autographs -- shipped within 48 hours of order, no less 
-- are the latest twist to the multimillion-dollar sports memorabilia market. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's buying this stuff? Not seasoned collectors, but the starry-eyed and 
often well-to-do who are willing to spend as much for a basketball autographed 
by Michael Jordan as for a washer and dryer. Unlike the washer and dryer, 
however, the $699 basketball is likely to find a spot on the mantel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Autographs are basically proof that you somehow interacted with a famous 
athlete," said Bob Lemke, publisher of Sports Collectors Digest. "But I wonder 
how many people are inclined to embellish the story about how they actually got 
their hands on these items." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the recent growth of the sports memorabilia market, few people 
recognize the easy availability of these products -- albeit at steep prices.  
</P>
<P>
 A baseball -- yes, a baseball -- autographed by Jordan began retailing this 
month for $299. That's more than twice the price of a limited-edition baseball 
autographed by Mickey Mantle, which sells for $139. In about six months, you'll 
also be able to purchase everything from baseball caps to baseball bats etched 
with Jordan's signature. 
</P>
<P>
 For $1,399, you can act like Los Angeles Laker legend Earvin (Magic) Johnson 
is your long-lost pal. That'll buy you a signed Laker jersey, a personalized 
letter and even a chunk of the Forum floor -- all framed, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 For $1,400 you can also get your hands on a Louisville Slugger bat personally 
signed by former baseball great Ted Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to forget the upcoming World Cup soccer games. A soccer ball autographed 
by every member of the 1994 U.S. World Cup soccer team hit the market this 
month for $249. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you set a value on those things?" asked Bob Carr, publisher of Inside 
Sporting Goods magazine. "I'm not convinced that anyone's autograph is worth 
that much." 
</P>
<P>
 A far cry all this is from leaning over the right-field fence, shouting until 
you're hoarse, hoping that any ballplayer will trot over and sign your score 
card. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike such ballpark scenes, Upper Deck several times a year ships a truckload 
of basketballs or photographs to wherever Michael Jordan is staying. Consumer 
fear of forgery is so great that the firm pays employees to simply observe 
Jordan signing the items, then sign affidavits to that effect. The firm 
notarizes the authenticity of the items with tamper-proof holograms. 
</P>
<P>
 "This phenomenon is growing because sports are now blanketing television," 
said Paul Goldin, president and chief executive of Score Board Inc., the Cherry 
Hill, N.J.-based firm that is the biggest in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody from Rapid City to New York City knows who these stars are," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Owning an autographed item "is a badge of honor," added Stuart Ellis, 
president of Carlsbad-based Upper Deck Authenticated, established 18 months ago 
as a joint venture between the baseball card maker Upper Deck Inc. and Los 
Angeles Kings owner Bruce McNall. "It gives someone a chance to boast, 'I have 
a piece of Larry Bird in my home,' " Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Upper Deck Authenticated and Score Board go to great lengths to persuade 
consumers to buy sports memorabilia. Both advertise on home shopping television 
shows. Both display memorabilia in men's departments at stores ranging from 
Bloomingdale's to J.C. Penney. Upper Deck sends catalogues by the millions to 
sports magazine subscribers. And, with one retail store open at Citywalk in 
Universal City, Upper Deck is hoping to expand its shops nationally by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a way for consumers to buy glamour," said Jerald Jellison, professor of 
psychology at USC. "You hope to be somehow elevated in the eyes of the person 
who sees these things." 
</P>
<P>
 The sky-high prices can make these items a tough sell. Upper Deck 
Authenticated lost money in its first year, Ellis conceded. But the prices are 
not likely to come down much because of the huge fees these firms must pay 
big-name athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Upper Deck recently paid Michael Jordan more than $5 million for exclusive 
rights to market his sports memorabilia for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But rival Score Board countered by inking a deal with superstar center 
Shaquille O'Neal. O'Neal's autographed basketballs sell for about $199. That's 
about $500 less than Upper Deck is asking for a basketball signed by Jordan. Of 
course, O'Neal is no Jordan. And it's still too early to tell if O'Neal will be 
a memorabilia hit or miss. 
</P>
<P>
 All it takes is a few bad decisions and memorabilia companies can get stuck 
with piles of unsold items. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Upper Deck recently tried to sell items autographed by famous 
football players from the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did well for about a week, then dropped off completely," Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Score Board has been hard-pressed to sell much merchandise signed by 
Darryl Strawberry, the troubled Los Angeles Dodger slugger now undergoing 
treatment for substance abuse. "We have a few thousand items of his that we 
can't sell," Goldin said. The Price of Fame 
</P>
<P>
 It's a far cry from nickel baseball cards. Fans today are paying big money for 
sports memorabilia, from baseballs autographed by Michael Jordan to football 
jerseys signed by Joe Montana. Here are some of the more unusual items offered 
for sale by Upper Deck Authenticated.

UNOCAL REPORT ON MYANMAR REJECTED; ENERGY: SHAREHOLDERS DEFEAT PROXY RESOLUTION 
CALLING FOR STUDY ON ALLEGED HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS RELATED TO PIPELINE 
PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KARL SCHOENBERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shareholders of Unocal Corp. voted Monday to reject a proxy resolution calling 
on the company to make a comprehensive report on conditions in Myanmar 
(formerly Burma), where allegations of human rights violations have stirred 
controversy over a Unocal gas pipeline project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our record on human rights is as good or better than any other 
company," Richard J. Stegemeier, Unocal's chief executive, said at a news 
conference after the company's annual shareholders meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors filed into the meeting hall of the Los Angeles headquarters Monday 
morning past about 40 human rights activists, who chanted, "You don't care, 
Unocal." 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstrators held vigil in the light rain, using huge helium balloons to 
float a 28-foot banner emblazoned with a blown-up photograph of a man in leg 
irons and a caption that read, "Stop Unocal's Chainsaw Gang Debacle in Burma." 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the shareholder resolution allege that forced labor is 
widespread in Myanmar and that such abuses have taken place on infrastructure 
projects in the area of the planned pipeline. The company denies there is any 
evidence to link Unocal to human rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the defeat of the Myanmar resolution, Unocal's public relations 
problems appear far from over. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal entered a no-contest plea last month to three criminal misdemeanor 
counts in connection with the leakage of diluent -- a diesel-like thinning 
agent -- at its Guadalupe oil field in San Luis Obispo County. The company 
agreed to pay a $1.5-million fine and to clean up as many as 200,000 barrels of 
diluent that had leaked into the sand over the past 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Stegemeier, who steps down as chief executive at the end of April, said the 
company had set the "highest ethical standards" for itself but "unfortunately 
we failed to meet these standards at the Guadalupe oil field." 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal is charging $25 million to after-tax earnings in the first quarter of 
1994 in connection with the Guadalupe spill, but Stegemeier said the write-down 
will not have a "material effect on the company's financial condition." (Unocal 
on Monday announced that net earnings for the first quarter were $54 million, 
or 19 cents a share, up from $11 million, or 1 cent a share, for the same 
period a year ago.) 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the sponsors of the Myanmar resolution said the results of the 
proxy ballot -- a 14.1% yes vote -- was large enough to ensure that they would 
file the measure again next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not going to go away," said a spokesman for the Interfaith Center on 
Corporate Responsibility, the initiative's sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 Stegemeier said the company will decide later whether it will appeal to the 
Securities and Exchange Commission to have future resolutions on Myanmar 
stricken from its proxy statements. 
</P>
<P>
 At the shareholders meeting, several human rights advocates denounced Unocal's 
willingness to work with the military junta that rules Myanmar with an iron 
fist.  
</P>
<P>
 "You are partners in crime," said Taw Myo Myint, a former student protester 
who sought political asylum in the United States after a bloody repression of 
dissidents in 1988. She owns 10 shares of Unocal stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Stegemeier said a team of Unocal officials visited the pipeline area last week 
and found no evidence of forced labor or destruction of villages, as critics 
have maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 But one of Unocal's investigators, Joel P. Robinson, said the team was in the 
area only one day and that its access was restricted by local Myanmar military 
authorities, who determined where they could land their helicopter.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON AND CLAUDIA ELLER: HOLLYWOOD MOVES TO COLONIZE CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON and CLAUDIA ELLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as the late President Richard M. Nixon opened the door to China more than 
20 years ago, Hollywood is trying to open the doors to Chinese movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the major studios are in discussions with the Beijing government over 
ways to crack the world's biggest untapped entertainment market, which largely 
has been closed to the outside world because of the Communist regime's rigid 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest initiative, Warner Bros. co-Chairmen Robert Daly and Terry Semel 
have quietly traveled to China to explore everything from theater construction 
and direct movie distribution to satellite TV and building a theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 With China's growing economy and more than 1 billion citizens, Hollywood sees 
the market there as a potential mother lode. But executives also caution that 
the gold strike won't come quickly or easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Williams-Jones, president of United International Pictures, the 
overseas distribution arm for Universal, Paramount and MGM/UA, said the effort 
could take 10 years. "The potential, as everyone recognizes, is virtually 
unlimited," he said Monday. "But it would be quite foolish for anyone to look 
for instant gratification." 
</P>
<P>
 One long-running complication is film piracy. The Motion Picture Assn. of 
America estimates that $50 million in movie revenue alone is lost each year to 
illegal China-based sales. MPAA President Jack Valenti is lobbying the U.S. 
trade office to turn up the heat on Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 "China is our highest priority in the world for combatting intellectual 
piracy, and the Chinese have done absolutely zero enforcement of whatever the 
copyright laws they have," Valenti said. "They are also probably the major 
source of the worldwide production of illegally pirated laser discs exported 
throughout Asia." 
</P>
<P>
 Strict quotas on foreign imports, high entertainment taxes, low ticket prices 
and a shortage of movie screens that are up to modern standards also complicate 
Hollywood's plans to colonize China. Only a small percentage of people live in 
cities and are considered regular filmgoers. Sources estimate that less than 
8,000 screens are up to U.S. standards, and the average ticket price is said to 
be about 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 But entertainment analyst Jeffrey Logsdon of Seidler Cos. in Los Angeles says 
the economies of scale must also be considered. "If only 1% of the people go 
and you only charge one-fiftieth of the admission that you'd charge here, you 
still get to some pretty big numbers," said Logsdon, who estimated that 
Hollywood would reap tens of millions of dollars from a more open Chinese 
market early on. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenti and others also see promising signals coming from the China Film 
Export and Import Corp., the government agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry took it as one promising sign when UIC, a theater chain whose 
partners include MCA Inc. and Paramount Communications Inc., recently received 
permission to build a Western-style multiplex in Shanghai. Variety also 
reported last month that the Chinese have agreed to a 60-40 revenue split with 
foreign distributors on at least 10 movies a year, after previously paying a 
low, flat fee for films allowed into the country. That's a significant 
development for distributors, who previously collected only $50,000 per title. 
</P>
<P>
 "China is very receptive to investment," MCA Motion Picture Group Chairman Tom 
Pollock said. "There's no question it will become one of the biggest markets in 
the world. The only question is when." 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the industry take it as a promising sign that Daly and Semel are 
personally participating in the Warner Bros. trade mission, along with fellow 
Time Warner Inc. executives Wayne Duband, Richard Fox, Ed Frumkes, Jim Miller, 
Rob Friedman and Sandy Reisenbach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that Bob and Terry went there indicates a significantly more 
aggressive posture among the studios," said one Warner affiliate. While Warner 
declined to comment, others said Daly and Semel are primarily looking to forge 
alliances with local partners -- as they have in some other overseas 
territories such as Japan -- rather than make direct investments initially. 
</P>
<P>
 One source familiar with Warners' pursuits said the company "is hoping to 
negotiate the first agreement of its kind for theatrical distribution" sometime 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently installed 20th Century Fox President Bill Mechanic, who previously 
headed Buena Vista International and was responsible for Walt Disney Co. 
forging a distribution network overseas, said Fox is naturally interested in 
China but has not yet sent a task force there. Mechanic was very circumspect 
about discussing specific plans Fox might be mulling. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of interest in the marketplace and it's attracting a lot of 
people -- distributors and theater groups -- looking for that pot of gold," 
Mechanic said, "but it's a very difficult country to do business in right now." 
</P>

 King's ransom: Producer and onetime journalist Andrea King has sold her script 
"Body Language" to Warner Bros. for $350,000, against a $600,000 payment if the 
project is made. Warner bought the script, described as a "female Cyrano de 
Bergerac tale," in a bidding war. The project was acquired for Steven 
Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment to produce.

JUMP IN HOME RESALES HITS A 7-YEAR HIGH IN CALIFORNIA; REAL ESTATE: A SCRAMBLE 
TO LOCK IN MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES IS CITED IN THE 31.3% RISE IN THE STATE OVER 
A YEAR AGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A rush to lock in lower mortgage rates, coupled with reawakening consumer 
confidence, dramatically boosted sales of existing homes in California in 
March, easing immediate fears that the recent rise in interest rates will stall 
the state's nascent economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Home sales last month jumped 31.3% compared to March, 1993, the 10th 
consecutive monthly increase and the largest rise in seven years, according to 
a report released Monday by the California Assn. of Realtors. Nationally, 
existing home sales rose 18.4% in March compared to a year ago, to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 4.06 million units. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, home resales rose 53.7% from February and were up 28.4% 
compared to March, 1993. The median price was $214,040, an increase of 4.4% 
from February but down 1.3% from March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The results prompted some economists to predict that home sales in 1994 will 
hit near-record levels nationally, despite increases in fixed-rate mortgages of 
more than 1.5 percentage points since last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 However, several economists were more cautious, noting that it is still too 
early to gauge the full impact of rising interest rates on the nation's and 
state's housing markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real test is still ahead," said Gary Schlossberg, vice president and 
senior economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. "The latest figures 
provide only a snapshot of the past, not necessary a glimpse of the future. We 
believe that the interest rate increases certainly won't kill the housing 
recovery, but it could be weaker than we had projected earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, for the third time this year, the Federal Reserve Board raised its 
federal funds rate -- the rate banks charge each other on overnight loans -- to 
keep the national economy from overheating. As a result, banks and other 
lenders have made corresponding increases in consumer interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the average 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage in the United States 
rose to 7.68% in March from 7.15% in February, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corp. said, adding approximately $50 to the monthly mortgage payment of a 
typically priced home nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America predicted that the average 30-year 
mortgage will climb to 8.90% by the end of the year and increase to 9.15% in 
1995. The rate now stands at about 8.55%. 
</P>
<P>
 Several analysts noted that many potential home buyers were pushed off the 
fence when mortgage rates, which reached their lowest level in a generation in 
October, began to rise markedly in February. With buyers seeking to lock in 
lower rates, sales in March surged. 
</P>
<P>
 The realty organization reported that 510,590 existing, single-family detached 
homes in California closed escrow during March on a seasonally adjusted annual 
basis -- up 0.9% from a revised rate of 506,270 homes sold in February. The 
annualized figure represents the total number of homes that would be sold 
during 1994 if sales occurred at the March pace throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the median price of an existing, single-family detached home in 
March was $183,840, up 1.6% from a revised $180,980 in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, sales of existing homes rose 5.7% in March to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 4.06 million units, compared to a revised rate of 3.84 
million in February.

 Orange County's 27 community banks suffered through their worst year in recent 
memory as falling real estate values and soured business loans left them with a 
combined 1993 loss of $50.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Only nine banks posted profits, and Landmark Bank in La Habra was the only one 
of the 10 biggest banks to record a money-making year. 
</P>
<P>
 The same banks earned an aggregate $4.3 million for 1992, according to 
government figures compiled by Sheshunoff Information Services Inc. in Austin, 
Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the worst year I've ever seen for local banks," said J.B. Crowell, who 
has been chief executive of Eldorado Bank in Tustin since it opened in 1972. 
"On a strictly economic basis, I don't see much movement out of this 
recession." 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the amount of bad loans -- those delinquent for 60 days or 
longer -- increased by $31.4 million last year. Bankers and regulators are 
concerned about the growing number of bad loans at community banks because 
those loans usually indicate bigger troubles ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief indicator of loan problems is the rise in delinquent loans, which 
accounted for 4.6% of all loans last year. Bad loans shouldn't exceed 3%, 
bankers and regulators say. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowell sees a vicious cycle that hasn't yet abated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major problem has been real estate loans on commercial and industrial 
buildings," he said. "The tenants just aren't there. Whether it's service 
stations, shopping centers, industrial buildings, the recession has really 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 The riskiness of such loans typically was determined by construction costs, 
the market value of the buildings and analyses of the income that the buildings 
generate. But when buildings are 50% vacant, their value plummets, as does the 
borrower's financial worth. 
</P>
<P>
 And with interest rates going up, Crowell pointed out, borrowers will have to 
make bigger monthly payments, which could affect their cash flow and make it 
harder for them to repay loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all just shows that Southern California is getting hit harder with this 
recession than even Northern California," he said. "And all I hear is a lot of 
rhetoric from politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 Eldorado, the county's third-largest bank, with $323 million in loans and 
other assets, lost nearly $1.6 million last year. But seven banks lost more. 
</P>
<P>
 Deepest in red ink was troubled CommerceBank in Newport Beach, which lost 
$12.6 million. It was followed by three other troubled institutions: Sunwest 
Bank in Tustin, which lost $9.5 million, Commercial Center Bank in Santa Ana, 
which lost $9.2 million, and Pioneer Bank in Fullerton, which lost $9.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 CommerceBank, Sunwest and Pioneer have levels of capital -- their final 
reserve against losses -- that are precariously low, and they are trying to 
find needed cash from existing shareholders or, more likely, new investors. 
Meantime, regulators have imposed their severest restrictions on the operations 
of the three institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial Center, despite its heavy loss, is the county's most well-financed 
bank.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the banks in the county are operating under various forms of 
government restrictions, but an order against Landmark Bank, caused in part by 
an employee fraud, was lifted last fall as the bank corrected internal controls 
and continued to be profitable. It earned $1.4 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's most profitable bank was one that decided to get out of the 
industry because increasing regulations and paperwork became too burdensome for 
smaller community banks. Colonial Bank earned $1.9 million as it started last 
year to liquidate its assets. It has turned over its deposits to National Bank 
of Southern California in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 No other county bank earned more than $1 million last year. Orange County Bank

BANK OF NEWPORT ACCUSES CUSTOMER OF FRAUD; FINANCE: THE INSTITUTION SAYS IT 
LOST $4.5 MILLION IN AN EQUIPMENT LEASE SCHEME. U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN LOS 
ANGELES IS INVESTIGATING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Bank of Newport, trying to rebuild after several years of turmoil, said 
Monday that a corporate loan customer has defrauded it of $4.5 million in an 
equipment lease scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank said it expects its insurance to cover the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles said it is investigating the 
allegation of fraud and that a Costa Mesa couple who operate the leasing 
company are cooperating. 
</P>
<P>
 In typical lease financing, a bank lends money to a company to purchase 
equipment, such as trucks or computers. The company then leases the equipment 
to other businesses at a rate that will cover monthly payments on the loan and 
provide a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news release, Bank of Newport said a longtime customer that buys and 
leases trucks and heavy equipment began last year to take out loans and issue 
leases on equipment it never bought. Some lessees even told the bank that they 
received the equipment when, in fact, they had not, the bank said. The news 
release said that payments made by those lessees had been reimbursed by the 
bank's customer. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Richard Robinson confirmed that the borrowers were 
cooperating with the investigation, but he said that it was "premature to 
discuss any disposition" and that "no pleas have been entered yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's lawyer would not comment Monday. The telephone number for their 
home was disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bank of Newport has been trying to correct a series of loan problems that 
have caused it to lose $7.5 million over the past two years. Regulators have 
restricted its operations and demanded that the bank raise more money from 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Insiders have pumped in more cash to raise the bank's level of capital, its 
final reserve against losses, but an offering to shareholders was canceled in 
February, partly because the bank continued to post operating losses.

FORECLOSURES INCREASE AT SLOWER RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of real estate foreclosures in Orange County increased during the 
first three months of this year but at a slower rate than in previous quarters, 
indicating that the beleaguered market may be stabilizing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders took back 1,486 Orange County homes and commercial properties during 
the first three months of 1994, up 2.8% from 1,446 properties for the previous 
quarter, according to figures released Monday by TRW Redi Property Data, a real 
estate data firm in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 While the number of foreclosures across Southern California is still on the 
rise, the rate of increase has leveled off from last year's double-digit 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a trend," said Nima Nattagh, an analyst with TRW. "I think foreclosures 
will continue to stabilize for the rest of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a gradual real estate recovery on the way, in particular in Orange 
County."  
</P>
<P>
 During the first quarter, lenders took back 14,430 properties in the six 
Southern California counties, an increase of 4.8% from the previous quarter and 
of 32% from the first quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The regional numbers do not yet indicate foreclosures that might result from 
January's Northridge earthquake. Typically, about four months elapse from the 
time that an owner defaults on a mortgage until the lender forecloses on the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 TRW Redi estimates that about 85% of the latest quarter's foreclosures were on 
single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside County showed the region's largest increase in foreclosures: 14.3%. 
More Foreclosures, But Rate Slows 
</P>
<P>
 Property repossessions are still rising in Southern California, but the rate 
of increase has stabilized. During the first quarter of this year, lenders 
foreclosed on 14,430 properties in the Southern California six-county region, 
an increase of 4.8% from the previous quarter, but well below the double-digit 
quarterly increases of early 1993. 06,18,09,09,09,09,09 *4*1993 1994 First

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: AMERICAN HEALTH RESTRUCTURES ITS LOAN PAYMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American Health Services Corp., which operates diagnostic centers, said Monday 
it has restructured its lending agreement with its primary bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the deal signed April 12, the company will delay a $9.6-million payment 
due in May until January, 1996, and cut the payment amount by $2.1 million.A 
restructured payment plan also saves the company $215,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 American Health Services, based in Newport Beach, runs centers that do 
diagnostic tests such as computer imaging, which is similar to an X-ray. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately Monday, the company released its results for 1993, posting a loss 
of $2.5 million, or 25 cents a share. That compared to a loss of $14.7 million, 
or $1.51 a share, for the previous 12 months. Annual revenues fell 2% to $37.5 
million from $38.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fourth quarter, the company reported a loss of $949,000, or 10 cents a 
share, compared to a loss of $14.1 million, or $1.47 a share, for the same 
period a year earlier. Three-month revenue fell to $9.3 million from $9.4 
million.

 Road Smarts: Rockwell International Corp., the technology giant based in Seal 
Beach, plans to spend more than $25 million in research and development this 
year to help create products and applications for so-called smart cars and 
smart highways. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Rockwell's projects unveiled last week are a traffic sensor aimed at 
measuring traffic flow, a vehicle locating system that helps monitor the 
whereabouts of a fleet of trucks or other vehicles and a navigation system for 
passenger cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Black, chief operating officer, said Rockwell is combining its expertise 
in electronics, military systems and automotive components to build better 
roads, cars and trucks.  
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Rockwell's TrafficCam, which uses machine vision technology, is 
a traffic sensor that could be mounted on a post and used to replace loop 
detectors, which are buried in the pavement.

20TH CENTURY LOSES A CUSTOMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Referring to your article, "Post-Quake 20th Century Rethinks Strategy," on 
April 12: 
</P>
<P>
 Poor abused 20th Century. Having read your article, I really feel sorry for 
them, having such hard times with all of those claims, suffering such 
losses.What a pity. 
</P>
<P>
 How can 20th Century lose one dollar, far from the claim of $166.7 million 
(loss), when they will not answer their phones? No answer -- no claims. 
</P>
<P>
 They ran ads in The Times listing several phone numbers. I wondered at the 
time why they spent any money doing that when they would not answer. Not even a 
recorded message. I would have felt better to get a recording that said: "Tough 
luck sucker policyholder. We collected your premiums for the last 20 years and 
now that you need help, too bad. Since we have not refunded anything that 
Proposition 103 declared, what makes you think we are going to help you now?" 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the quake, we thought our wonderful, caring insurance 
company would be overloaded with claims, so we waited two or three weeks before 
trying to call. Then no answer. We tried all the numbers, but that did not 
matter; no recording, no busy signal, just no answer. 
</P>
<P>
 So if you can determine how a company that does not honor any of its 
obligations can lose money, I would really like to know. 
</P>
<P>
 I regret having recommended 20th to others. We will find another insurance 
company.

CONSULT ATTORNEY TO FILE BANKRUPTCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Ron Galperin's article, "Filing for Bankruptcy Won't Always 
Save Your House" (April 12), will result in more individuals filing bankruptcy 
cases for themselves and unnecessarily losing their properties. Although Mr. 
Galperin's article begins strongly by warning consumers not to believe the 
inflated claims of advertisers, and even quotes the assistant U. S. trustee, 
the article sadly concludes by suggesting that individuals can save money by 
doing their own paperwork or "perhaps hiring a paralegal service instead of a 
law firm." 
</P>
<P>
 The point that should have been stressed is that for anyone who has assets, 
representing yourself in a bankruptcy case is likely to prove the old adage "he 
who represents himself has a fool for a client." A bankruptcy case is not a 
simple process and, especially for an individual with assets, pre-bankruptcy 
planning is essential to ensure the best result. Further, only an attorney 
should give such advice. The Office of the United States Trustee has made a 
strong effort recently to rid the bankruptcy system of unscrupulous paralegal 
services that are practicing law without a license. Mr. Galperin's article 
directs individuals to exactly the wrong source for competent legal advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get what you pay for" can often mean the difference between saving one's 
home from foreclosure and losing those assets. Especially for individuals who 
own real property, a professional should be consulted prior to filing a 
bankruptcy case.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The newly elected Salvadoran National Assembly, including for the first time 
former leftist guerrillas who once fought to bring down the government, takes 
office Sunday.The assembly will be dominated by the ruling Nationalist 
Republican Alliance, or Arena, a right-wing party that holds 39 of 84 seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one deputies come from the former guerrilla army, the Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front, which disarmed itself as part of U.N.-brokered peace 
accords that ended the brutal civil war two years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 The deputies were elected March 20, while a runoff election last Sunday gave 
the presidency to Arena's Armando Calderon Sol.

 Miltos Louisides was taking an 8 a.m. shower in his plush room at the Grand 
Hotel Europe when someone began knocking insistently at the door. Dripping wet, 
the British businessman opened it to see a bald man of about 40 in the hallway, 
an idiotic smile on his face and a Snickers bar in his outstretched hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Baffled, Louisides accepted the candy and closed the door, but apparently it 
didn't lock. He returned to the bathroom to towel off and stepped out a minute 
later to find his black briefcase gone. Inside were $15,000, 6 million rubles, 
plane tickets, credit cards and contracts for his company's cotton deals in 
Central Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisides called hotel security to ask them to seal the exits. But too late; 
the man was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was stupid," Louisides said. "I should never have opened the door." 
</P>
<P>
 He was also lucky. Not only did his briefcase turn up in a hotel lobby across 
town, wiped clean of fingerprints and minus everything but the plane tickets 
and contracts, but he was also unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
 As crime rises across Russia, foreigners are becoming the special targets of 
thieves and extortionists who are better armed, better organized and more 
violent than ever. According to the Interior Ministry, there were 8,304 crimes 
against foreigners last year, about 70% more than in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the crime is concentrated where the foreigners are -- in Moscow and 
St. Petersburg -- and police in the two cities say some gangs specialize in 
preying on innocents abroad. Foreigners are easy and obvious targets, 
identifiable by the restaurants they frequent, the cars they drive, even by 
such details as eyeglasses or book bags. And in a country where the average 
monthly wage is about $80, they are fabulously wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, the local belief was that the Mafia restricted their activities 
to Russians, keeping their hands off the foreign business community," said a 
recent report by the U.S. Consulate in St. Petersburg, using Mafia to describe 
local gangsters. "If that situation was ever true, it certainly is no longer 
the case in St. Petersburg." 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen American employees at the consulate, more than half the staff, have 
been crime victims in the past six months. One was mugged by a band of street 
urchins in a populous area where no one came to his aid. Another was beaten and 
robbed by a cab driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign businesses are routinely approached by racketeers demanding protection 
money, and about one in five pays up, according to Col. Sergei F. Sidorenko of 
the St. Petersburg police organized crime division. 
</P>
<P>
 Attacks on foreigners in St. Petersburg, Russia's second city, are so alarming 
that the consuls general of the United States, Germany, Finland, Britain and 
Sweden complained about them in a letter to Mayor Anatoly A. Sobchak last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Sobchak has written Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin asking for special 
crime-fighting powers, including the ability to mobilize army paratroopers 
based near the city. Soldiers could be used to strengthen patrols, Sobchak 
said, especially at night -- when, according to the U.S. Consulate report, 
foreigners are in special danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never, never, venture out at night alone, go to a club and then expect to 
find a reputable taxi driver," the report warns. "Virtually guaranteed: You 
will be robbed. . . . Americans, who may have been observed drinking and 
dancing earlier in the evening, have been followed home and then robbed, beaten 
and murdered in their own apartments." 
</P>
<P>
 The report also warns foreigners on the Moscow-St. Petersburg overnight 
tourist train to secure the doors to their sleeping berths with electrical wire 
to keep out intruders who routinely break in and spray an odorless gas to drug 
passengers into deeper sleep before robbing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime against foreigners may well be worse in Moscow, which is twice the size 
of St. Petersburg, and is not unusual in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Last October, 34-year-old Lauren Binklin, a Canadian who worked for a 
children's charity in Moscow, was tricked into opening her apartment door by a 
woman she had befriended a few days earlier. The visitor was accompanied by two 
men, and police said they killed Binklin for a tape recorder, camera and $100 
in cash. The Russian woman was tracked down and charged with the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But St. Petersburg has gained special notoriety in recent months. The year 
began with a New Year's Eve explosion at a shoe store partly owned by Italians 
that blew boots, pumps and spike heels across Stone Island Prospekt. Local TV 
showed citizens combing the avenue with charred and twisted shoes in hand, 
searching for matching pairs. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later, a fender-bender involving members of two rival Russian 
gangs set off a shootout that left 10 people dead. The winning gang blithely 
trucked the corpses in the loser's van to a wooded area, doused them with 
gasoline and set them afire. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, police pulled over a small Zhiguli -- a boxy, Russian car -- 
towing a black Mercedes limousine through early morning streets. Seven corpses 
wrapped in canvas were packed in the Mercedes. Police later arrested six 
Russian businessmen, who said the corpses were bodies of racketeers who had 
demanded $65,000 in protection money from their company. 
</P>
<P>
 Many crimes go unreported, as foreigners and Russians alike view police as 
corrupt and incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are indeed. GAI, the Russian highway patrol, is notorious for pulling 
over cars with foreign plates to assess whopping fines for imaginary 
violations. Motorists who refuse to pay are threatened with blood alcohol tests 
with dirty needles, the U.S Consulate said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, five policemen attacked a U.S. Consulate employee in St. 
Petersburg with fists and truncheons. The American, who had been drinking, said 
he was beaten after being handcuffed by police officers, who shouted at him 
that the United States had killed Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Gen. Arkady G. Kramarev, chief of the St. Petersburg police, said many 
foreign businessmen in need of help avoid the police because they are afraid to 
defy the mob or fear further scrutiny of their own dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have heard foreign businessmen say that it's easier to pay the mob than to 
pay the tax inspector," Kramarev said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet of 300 Russian and foreign businessmen who turned to police in 1993, none 
suffered any repercussions, Kramarev said. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Petersburg's grim new look is taking a toll on tourism. Vladimir N. 
Karpenkov, who heads a police team that investigates crimes against foreigners, 
says the number of tourists each year has fallen fourfold since the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the alarming anecdotes, the city's murder rate is lower than that of 
Los Angeles, New York and many other U.S. cities. St. Petersburg reported 875 
murders among its 5 million people last year, compared to 1,058 among the 3.6 
million people of Los Angeles. Police said six of the victims were foreigners: 
citizens of Germany, the United States, Vietnam, Finland, Latvia and Mongolia. 
Nearly 17,000 people reported being mugged in 1993, 282 of them foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't scare Americans with crime," Mayor Sobchak says, and many Americans 
doing business here agree. 
</P>
<P>
 John and Anna Mahli, developers from La Canada-Flintridge, come frequently to 
St. Petersburg, looking for Russian partners to help build prefabricated 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 During the August, 1991, military coup against Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, and again during the armed uprising against Yeltsin last October, 
the Mahlis advised friends in Moscow to come to St. Petersburg, which was 
quieter during those violent events. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans get a jaundiced version," said Anna Mahli. "When my neighbors hear 
that I'm going to St. Petersburg, they say, 'Oh, Russia, it's so dangerous!' 
And I say: 'Sweetie, I live in L.A. There's nothing there to scare me.' "

NATIONAL AGENDA; SEEDS OF HOPE IN THE KILLING FIELDS; AN UNUSUAL REGIME IS 
HEALING THE ECONOMY AND FREEING CAMBODIA'S PRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly a year after Cambodia held national elections under U.N. auspices, 
there is a war raging, the economy is limping and gunmen roam the roads. But 
the country is not a basket case. 
</P>
<P>
 The government, an odd-couple coalition of a failed Communist regime and a 
royalist guerrilla force, is still in place despite a decade of hatred and 
widespread predictions of imminent collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Its combined army has captured the headquarters of the infamous Khmer Rouge 
near the Thai border and now has the Maoist guerrillas, who ruled Cambodia in a 
savage reign from 1975 to 1978, on the defensive, if not defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 And after years of runaway inflation that meant printing money to pay 
salaries, the government has taken steps to stabilize the economy. The result: 
The Cambodian currency has climbed in value against the U.S. dollar, and prices 
have dropped 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 Phnom Penh, for more than 15 years a capital of doctrinaire Communists, now 
has a robust free press, and tourists are flooding back to the country and its 
ancient temples. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cambodia is doing better than anybody could reasonably hope for," said 
Valerie Cliff, an official of the U.N. Development Program in Phnom Penh. 
</P>
<P>
 One sign of international confidence came last month at a Tokyo conference of 
aid donors. They pledged $770 million in new assistance for this year and next, 
nearly double the figure the government expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news doesn't mean Cambodia's problems are over. For instance, the 
government remains beset by political bickering; crucial legislation has been 
stalled for months, and King Norodom Sihanouk's fight against cancer has 
created a leadership crisis. A coalition army, bringing together the forces of 
the former Phnom Penh government and two guerrilla groups, has had only mixed 
success in its fight against the dreaded Khmer Rouge guerrillas whose excesses 
have haunted Cambodia for 20 years. Although the new army succeeded in 
capturing two key Khmer Rouge strongholds along the border with Thailand in 
March, the guerrillas recaptured both. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Cambodia's prospects look much brighter now than they did after 
last May's elections, when a narrow election victory by Sihanouk's FUNCINPEC 
party over the ruling, Vietnam-backed Cambodia People's Party brought the 
country to the brink of civil war and threatened to unravel two years of 
painstaking work by the United Nations, which spent $2.5 billion to bring 
democracy to Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
 Because neither FUNCINPEC nor Hun Sen's government had the two-thirds majority 
needed to adopt a new constitution, they agreed on a unique power-sharing 
arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 Sihanouk's son Prince Norodom Ranariddh became first prime minister, while Hun 
Sen, who had headed the old regime in Phnom Penh, became second prime minister. 
All the ministries were given two ministers, one from each side, creating what 
was regarded as a recipe for certain gridlock. It hasn't been smooth sailing, 
but the relationship has proved far more durable than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 An example is the work of You Hockry, a co-minister of the interior and public 
security ministries who until last year worked in the reservations department 
of a Marriott hotel outside Washington, D.C., where he lived in exile. 
Following last year's elections, Phnom Penh was plagued by car thefts, 
especially of U.N. vehicles, carried out by men in government uniforms. 
Insiders suspected a gang organized by top officials in the old Hun Sen regime 
and doubted that the new coalition would have the clout to attack it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hockry confounded the skeptics, arresting former Transportation Minister 
Ros Chhun, his two sons and two policemen. They were charged with car theft and 
gun running, and two other security men were shot dead in raids. The car theft 
problem in Phnom Penh, at least, vanished overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 While the roads outside Phnom Penh remain dangerous -- a U.S. aid worker was 
shot recently and another is being held for ransom -- the problem is largely 
one of unpaid soldiers seeking money and not of officially backed crime. Many 
Cambodians are amazed that an outsider like Hockry was allowed to take on the 
entrenched powers. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most popular figures in the coalition government -- and the most 
controversial among his colleagues -- is Co-Finance Minister Sam Rainsy, who is 
also a FUNCINPEC official. When Rainsy took over last summer, the country was 
bankrupt. It was printing money at a feverish rate and was able to meet its 
payroll only by a cash advance from the departing U.N. forces. So the 
co-finance minister came up with a budget and persuaded the Parliament to adopt 
a law sending all government revenues to Phnom Penh, which redistributed a 
share back to the provinces. Previously the provinces just kept a large slice 
for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainsy also cracked down on smuggling, even chasing smugglers himself, to make 
his point that customs duties, the country's primary source of income, had to 
be collected. 
</P>
<P>
 Government revenues have quadrupled in three years, and the economy is 
climbing between 7% and 8% a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Hockry, Rainsy has shown no reluctance to take on top officials, in this 
case attacking corruption in a country where virtually everyone in government 
was on the take. Even Ranariddh has admitted that he accepts contributions 
because he can't live on his official salary of $70 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rainsy has made a number of strategic enemies by introducing taxes on big 
business and the rich to help close the budget deficit, as well as by targeting 
Thai businessmen who had reached comfortable arrangements with the former 
government by paying bribes. One powerful Thai was so angered at Rainsy's 
actions that he took out ads in the press calling him "the minister for 
destroying the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Rainsy appeared on the verge of being fired until help arrived in the form of 
a letter from King Sihanouk, who had been king once before in Cambodia's 
tumultuous history and who is widely revered here. He spends most of his time 
these days in Beijing undergoing cancer treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sihanouk said Rainsy had served Cambodia "with loyalty, effectiveness and 
courage, for the higher interests of the Cambodian people." The letter appears 
to have saved Rainsy's job, for the moment at least. 
</P>
<P>
 But the delicate power balance holding the regime together has also produced 
what one diplomat calls a "period of drift," because few people want to stick 
their necks out by taking initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, a desperately needed investment law, which would provide a legal 
basis for foreign companies to come into the country, should have been written 
months ago but has not been presented to Parliament yet. In fact, there is no 
formal system of law in Cambodia, no penal code or judicial rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The absence of investment legislation has kept foreign investment in Cambodia 
extremely low, despite what business people regard as the country's great 
potential. Foreign companies are understandably slow to send in money, since 
they're unsure they can get it out safely. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomers face a number of unhappy surprises. For instance, many of the 
FUNCINPEC officials who were elected last year, most of them middle-class 
expatriates, were aghast to find their co-ministers from the old Hun Sen regime 
to be "dollar millionaires" who drive $100,000 cars (Phnom Penh prices). 
Diplomats say many newcomers have been similarly seduced and now take their 
lead from the Hun Sen appointees. 
</P>
<P>
 The government surprised many observers by appointing new governors for all 21 
provinces -- posts of considerable clout. The total included 11 from FUNCINPEC, 
meaning that some powerful officials of the former Phnom Penh regime were out 
of a job. 
</P>
<P>
 A potential crisis for the government is what will happen when Sihanouk dies, 
and the king himself has already issued detailed arrangements for his funeral. 
Many diplomats regard his absence from the political scene as a blessing, 
because the 71-year-old king obsessively meddles in almost every government 
decision. Still, he represents a political glue holding together the country's 
disparate parts and factions. 
</P>
<P>
 Sihanouk has been trying to arrange peace talks between the government and the 
Khmer Rouge guerrillas. But while the king wants to include the Khmer Rouge in 
the government, neither his son Ranariddh nor his old enemy Hun Sen has shown 
much enthusiasm for the idea, particularly since the Khmer Rouge decision to 
boycott last year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, their government launched a major offensive against the guerrillas 
despite a public plea from Sihanouk that it refrain from attacking -- a sign, 
diplomats say, either that the government is no longer directly influenced by 
Sihanouk or that he tacitly supported the offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The major benefit of the attack that drove the guerrillas from their redoubt 
in the western town of Pailin was that it denied them income derived from the 
sale to Thai businessmen of gems and timber found in the area. But now that the 
town has been recaptured, and the Cambodian army has suffered a humiliating 
defeat, the Thais, ever the pragmatists, will no doubt continue to deal with 
the Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the fighting was to stop tomorrow, the problems left by the conflict 
will be around for years. Millions of land mines still blanket large areas of 
the country, crippling hundreds of civilians every month. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic benefits of the last few years have had relatively little 
trickle-down effect in the countryside, where 80% of Cambodia's 9 million 
people live much as they have for hundreds of years. People are beginning to 
pack up and move to the cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coming of the U.N. and the elections hasn't changed rural people's lives 
one bit," said Jaisankar Sarma of World Vision, a U.S. charity that works in 
Cambodia. "The disparity between urban and rural life has grown a lot. The 
disparity between rich and poor is growing larger." MAJOR EVENTS IN CAMBODIA: 
1955-93 
</P>
<P>
 1955 -- King Norodom Sihanouk abdicates the throne but remains prime minister 
of the country's civilian government. 
</P>
<P>
 1960s -- Sihanouk, now titled a prince, tries to remain neutral during the 
Vietnam War but permits Vietnamese occupation of eastern provinces in exchange 
for Hanoi's promise of Cambodian territorial integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 1965 -- Sihanouk breaks diplomatic relations with the United States under 
pressure from leftists. 
</P>
<P>
 1970 -- Right-wing coup overthrows the prince's government. Vietnamese-backed 
Khmer Rouge guerrillas begin campaign against the U.S.-backed regime of Lon 
Nol. 
</P>
<P>
 1975 -- The Khmer Rouge under leader Pol Pot seize power, order all city 
dwellers to abandon their homes and move to the countryside. They begin a 
three-year reign of terror in which the death toll from executions, starvation, 
disease and overwork exceeds 1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 1979 -- Vietnamese troops, supported by Cambodian rebels, invade and occupy 
the country, setting up a regime under Hun Sen loyal to Hanoi. Guerrilla 
warfare continues in the countryside for the next 13 years. The Vietnamese and 
Hun Sen forces are opposed by the Khmer Rouge, a U.S.-backed guerrilla group 
and forces loyal to Sihanouk. 
</P>
<P>
 1991 -- The four warring Cambodian factions sign a U.N.-sponsored peace 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 1993 -- The first multi-party free elections are held. The royalist party, 
known by its French initials, FUNCINPEC, and headed by Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, Sihanouk's son, wins 45% of the popular vote. In second place, 
headed by Hun Sen, the Cambodian People's Party gets 38% of the vote. The two 
leaders become the first and second prime ministers of the new government, and 
Sihanouk returns as king to the throne he abdicated in 1955.

THE WEEK AHEAD: VATICAN CITY; POPE TO MAFIA COUNTRY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pope John Paul II journeys to crime-tossed Sicily this weekend for a pastoral 
visit certain to include a round of pontifical Mafia-bashing. The visit will 
begin Friday and end Sunday, Vatican aides say. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Pope's regular visits to Italian parishes, the trip to industrial 
Catania on the island's east coast echoes a papal pilgrimage last spring to 
Agrigento in the heart of Mafia country further west. "Rise up, Sicily," John 
Paul urged there in one of the strongest speeches of his pontificate, calling 
for popular rebellion against organized crime's "culture of death." The murder 
of an activist priest a few months later was seen as the crime cartel's 
response to the Pope's speech. 
</P>
<P>
 The pontiff will also visit the city of Siracusa.

THE WEEK AHEAD: CARTAGENA; A MESSAGE FOR LATINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean 
(ECLAC) winds up its 25th ministerial conference Wednesday in the Spanish 
colonial city of Cartagena, Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 In a paper presented at the three-day meeting, ECLAC said economic 
restructuring in the region during the 1980s often concentrated income and 
increased poverty, "which at the beginning of the current decade affected about 
46% of the population." 
</P>
<P>
 If the fruits of growth are not more equitably distributed, it said, popular 
support for the economic system will be weakened. 
</P>
<P>
 Another U.N. report said economic stabilization eventually could lead to a 
free-trade zone in the hemisphere.

THE PRESS; RICHARD M. NIXON -- THE VIEW FROM ABROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard M. Nixon studied, practiced and embraced foreign policy as much as any 
American President, and there can be few corners of the world where his name 
was not known. Nor were there many foreign editorial cartoonists who did not 
take a swipe at his famous profile. 
</P>
<P>
 As Dwight D. Eisenhower's vice president, Nixon often made headlines abroad -- 
his motorcade attacked by leftist mobs in Caracas in 1959, his celebrated 
"kitchen debate" with Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 Notoriety came to him as the President who was elected to wind down the war in 
Vietnam but who more often appeared to be firing it up. He won praise for 
breaking a post-World War II diplomatic barrier in 1972 with his trip to China. 
</P>
<P>
 His world image, however, could not escape the taint of the Watergate scandal, 
as shown by these works of foreign cartoonists, penned before his death Friday.

CHANGING LIFESTYLES; POPPIES POP UP AGAIN; DENIED THE AID THEY WERE PROMISED, 
COLOMBIAN INDIANS ARE FORCED BACK TO THE CULTIVATION OF OPIUM TO SURVIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN AMBRUS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every two weeks, the 13 members of the Indian Council of the town of Mosoco 
gather at their small brick meeting house to discuss community affairs and gaze 
out the window at mountain slopes cleared for planting of opium poppies, the 
raw material of heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 The dark stains on the cliffs where trees have been cut and bushes burned 
bring back bitter memories of a previous drug boom. The Indian leaders recall 
the drug traffickers, guerrillas and paramilitary groups that burst into their 
lives before. They remember the disintegration of community values. And it is 
all beginning to happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago the government promised aid and development programs in exchange 
for a pledge by the Indians to stop growing poppies. A deal was struck. 
</P>
<P>
 But the government did not keep its promise, so the Indians have gone back on 
theirs. And Colombia, a country already tragically scarred by a cocaine culture 
and marijuana production, has now emerged as one of the world's leading 
producers of heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 The failed deal to stop poppy production by the 300,000 Indians of the state 
of Cauca -- in southwest Colombia, near the Ecuador border -- symbolizes 
Colombia's larger problem. The government, despite having rooted out thousands 
of hectares of coca, marijuana and poppy plants, is widely seen here as losing 
its grip again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told the people for a year that government aid was coming" in exchange for 
eliminating poppy cultivation, Adolpho Vivas, deputy governor of Mosoco, said 
of the unfulfilled agreement between the Indians and the Colombian authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the government never came through, people had no money to support their 
families, and they went back to planting again." 
</P>
<P>
 As hundreds of Indians on 12 reservations return to the lucrative heroin trade 
after a one-year moratorium, their leaders say the government delivered on only 
a tiny fraction of the development projects promised in a 1992 agreement. The 
anticipated windfall, which included projects to promote health, education and 
crop rotation on the Indian lands, was estimated at more than $27 million. The 
communities, with outside technical help, set about designing projects that 
would sustain long-term development. 
</P>
<P>
 When the promised aid did not come through, the Indians turned again to the 
temptations of the drug barons. And Colombia, which exported only cocaine and 
marijuana five years ago, is today regarded the second-largest producer of 
heroin in the hemisphere, after Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite $54 million in U.S. anti-narcotics aid to the Colombian armed forces 
in 1992 and eradication measures that wiped out 12,000 hectares of poppies that 
year, the nation now has an estimated 20,000 hectares of opium poppies under 
cultivation. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug traffickers, loosely linked to the Cali cocaine cartel and trained by 
Asian heroin producers, expected a bonanza when they first brought poppy seeds 
to the lush valleys and mountain plains of this backward region in 1988. 
Poppies grow more quickly than the coca bush used to make cocaine, and profits 
from heroin are eight to 10 times greater by volume. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to expand into a new business, the traffickers, with their promise of 
fast money, seduced impoverished communities living on subsistence agriculture 
with promises of heroin riches. By 1991, an Indian farmer who made about $500 a 
year growing potatoes and corn was making $25,000 a year or more growing 
poppies. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Paez community, one of the tribes of Mosoco, went on a spending 
spree. They fixed up their homes, bought motorcycles and purchased new land in 
the far-away coffee zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gaumbiano Indians of the lowlands invested in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a typical family, the father now has a small bus that he can use to make 
money when the poppy boom fades, the mother has a television, and the son has a 
motorcycle," said Claudia Pineros, an anthropologist who has worked in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 But the boom had a dark side that surfaced when the price for opium rocketed 
from two cents a gram in 1989 to $2.36 a gram in 1991. The alliance of greed 
and violence began to break the communities' values. The most notorious 
incidents were the direct result of drug-trafficking. Hundreds of Indians and 
peasants stole each other's drugs and money and killed each other in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug traffickers and their guerrilla allies from the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces of Colombia moved in from the outside to "settle accounts" with Indians 
they suspected of robbing them in drug deals. And paramilitary forces, often 
including members of Colombia's army or police, eliminated Indians who refused 
to abandon their land to drug barons. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 15, 1991, after unsuccessfully trying to acquire a village's lands and 
labor for poppy cultivation, a group of 50 men wearing ski masks entered the 
town of El Nilo, torched the villagers' huts and executed 20 Paez Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 The tightly knit social structures of the Indian communities began to unravel. 
Solidarity forged over centuries of struggle against Spaniards and Colombian 
landowners began to disintegrate. Armed teen-agers, their pockets bursting with 
money, roamed the streets, and many Indians openly defied the authority of 
their ruling councils, the relationship that had always kept the tribes 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money brought us to the point where people were drinking, fighting, wounding 
and killing members of their own villages," lamented one member of the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the environment, assiduously protected by the Indians, began to 
disappear. Poppy growers climbed high into the mountains to hack down forests 
and clear land for poppy cultivation. Rivers, deprived of shade, began to dry 
up. The sacred Lake Juantama, legendary home of an 18th-Century Indian chief, 
shrank, starving the flora and fauna around it. 
</P>
<P>
 With the society in tatters and rumors that the army was gearing up for aerial 
fumigation to kill the poppy fields, the Indian Council of Mosoco, along with 
58 others, asked the government for a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The final agreement, in which the communities pledged to pull up their poppies 
in return for development projects, was signed in May, 1992, by the Regional 
Indigenous Council of the Cauca and the head of the government's anti-narcotics 
police and other senior officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, one and a half years later, and despite a U.S. contribution of about 
$500,000, less than $1.1 million has been distributed to the Indians of Cauca 
under the agreement. Not one peso has come to the community of Mosoco. 
</P>
<P>
 Many villagers, feeling betrayed, were at the point of rebellion when the 
councils agreed not to stand in the way as the villagers returned to poppy 
cultivation. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back at the failure of the experiment, the Indian leaders express only 
frustration. They lament the destruction of their environment and fear the 
danger represented by drug traffickers, guerrillas and the Colombian army, 
which they believe is planning to spray their homeland with poisonous 
herbicides. They are especially bitter at the Colombian government and the 
United States, which they say do not understand their situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concern of the United States and other developed countries is eliminating 
the drug problem; our concern is eliminating poverty," said Sonia Hurtado, a 
member of the Mosoco council. "It would be better if we collaborated." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Marcos Avirama, a veteran Indian leader: "If there is truly interest in 
seeing the drug problem in our country disappear, there will have to be 
international aid for popular and social organizations fighting for the 
recovery of our productive and marketing capacity, our cattle raising and our 
environment."

POSTSCRIPT; BATTLING TO SAVE A BRIDGE TO PEACE; THE ELBE RIVER SPAN WHERE U.S. 
AND SOVIET SOLDIERS JOYOUSLY MET IN WORLD WAR II IS SLATED FOR DEMOLITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One afternoon in 1985, while he was listening to an East German band tooting 
out a bit of Dixieland jazz, Torgau resident Guenter Schoene was hit by what he 
thought was a brilliant idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Wouldn't it be a fine thing, he mused, to put on an international jazz 
festival in Torgau, right on the old stone bridge that spans the Elbe River 
there? The tune "Down by the Riverside," with its anti-war lyrics -- "I'm 
a-going to lay down my sword and shield/Down by the riverside/Ain't going to 
study war no more" -- would make a perfect theme song.  
</P>
<P>
 For Torgau, as it happens, is something more than just a sleepy backwater of 
the former Eastern Bloc. It was on Torgau's bridge, on April 25, 1945, that 
U.S. troops from of the 69th Infantry Division of the U.S. 1st Army, working 
their way eastward across Hitler's Germany, first encountered the Soviet troops 
slamming in from Poland.  
</P>
<P>
 For the soldiers who made the link-up, it was an ecstatic moment -- proof that 
fascism had been crushed and that the long, calamitous war in Europe would soon 
be over. "I never kissed so many men in my life," recalled American veteran Ben 
Casmere, in an oral history, "Yanks Meet Reds." 
</P>
<P>
 Together the GIs and the Soviets -- a guard division of the First Ukrainian 
Front -- broke out their accordions and balalaikas, toasted each other with 
beer and vodka, and took an informal "Oath of the Elbe," in which they vowed to 
do all they could to prevent another war. 
</P>
<P>
 It was this internationalist spirit that Schoene, and other self-declared 
Torgau pacifists, hoped to commemorate in song. 
</P>
<P>
 "My idea was to combine the message of 'Down by the Riverside' with the 
historic oath of peace that was taken here by the Elbe, and apply them to the 
needs of the world today," Schoene says. 
</P>
<P>
 But now -- on the anniversary week of the famed Allied encounter -- it appears 
that the bridge will not be around for a fete of any kind when next year's 50th 
commemoration rolls around. The German government is poised to tear it down. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the plan," confirms Torgau Mayor Wolfgang Gerstenberg in his office on 
Torgau's tidy 16th-Century town square. "The old bridge is really dilapidated. 
It's more than 100 years old. It would cost 9 million marks (about $5.6 
million) to repair it, and we don't have the money on hand." 
</P>
<P>
 But such talk is not something a jazz-loving history student of Torgau will 
countenance. Schoene and like-minded residents of the town are fighting an 
eleventh-hour battle to save the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a historical accident that the link-up took place here," admits 
Uwe Niedersen, another would-be preservationist. "It could have happened 
anywhere. But it did happen here, and it's the responsibility of Torgau to keep 
the memory alive, and not leave it as a sentence in the history books." 
</P>
<P>
 Few Americans today could probably even locate Torgau on a map of Europe with 
any confidence. But half a century ago, it was a dateline of tremendous 
international resonance. A photographer at the time posed a few of the U.S. and 
Soviet soldiers on the rubble of the bridge -- the Germans had dynamited it as 
they scattered -- and snapped their pictures for newspapers around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The low-ranking soldiers embraced each other and danced -- the first and last 
such brothers-in-arms hoopla between U.S. and Soviets until the end of the Cold 
War. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Yanks Meet Reds" (Capra Press), the oral history, 1st Lt. H.W. (Bill) 
Shank of the 104th Mechanized Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop, 104th Infantry, 
recalled the scene: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Russians took the five of us to dinner in a makeshift mess hall with a 
long table. We and Russian officers filled both sides of the table. A refined 
Russian captain sat next to me. He spoke good German, so we had fair 
communication. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The meal was macaroni and meat, salami, small raw fish, raw fat, meat covered 
with dough, black bread, hard-boiled eggs, hot chocolate, and cookies. Bottles 
of vodka had been spaced on the table at regular intervals, and half a water 
glass of vodka set at each place. The waiters wore light-blue tunics; every 
time I took a drink from my glass, the fellow behind me would refill it. 
Wishing to appear equal to my Russian hosts, I kept pouring the stuff into my 
boot, only to have the fellow give me more.... 
</P>
<P>
 "Of all the experiences in my life, finding and meeting the Russians was the 
most memorable.... The war made people love each other so much when it was 
finally over. If everyone intermingled -- like we did when we linked up with 
the Russians -- there could be no war." 
</P>
<P>
 An American rifleman who was there -- an English-German interpreter named Joe 
Polowsky -- found himself weeping at the contrast of the warm spring sunlight 
on the cold bodies of dead German civilians. From that day forward, until his 
death in 1983, Polowsky would stand every April 25 on the Michigan Avenue 
bridge in his native Chicago, buttonholing strangers and urging them to join 
him in renewing the Oath of the Elbe and fighting the arms race. In his will, 
Polowsky asked to be buried in Torgau -- a wish that was granted by the former 
East German government. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be conflicts forever and ever, but this bridge proves that people 
from two different systems can meet and in a short time communicate," notes 
Niedersehn. 
</P>
<P>
 The East German regime had similar ideas. It found in the Torgau bridge a 
handy plaything for the making of peace-and-brotherhood propaganda. Every few 
years, it would break out some red bunting, enlist a military band, roll out 
some Warsaw Pact jeeps and Russian officers tinkling with medals, and hold what 
Schoene describes as "rigid" ceremonies at the Elbe. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoene didn't think much of the military bands, and believed a jazz festival 
would be much better. 
</P>
<P>
 "But of course, that was impossible," he says. "Our leaders weren't interested 
in letting ordinary people stage such a festival." Indeed, he adds, he once 
tried to snap a picture of the official Communist ceremonies and was arrested 
for his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came 1989. The Berlin Wall was knocked down, and the East German 
government collapsed. With the reunification of Germany, Schoene believed that 
his chance to commemorate the April, 1945, proceedings had come at long last.  
</P>
<P>
 But what he didn't reckon on was the reunified German government's eagerness 
to bring the former East's roads and bridges up to Western standards. The 
Bundestag in Bonn has appropriated a torrent of money for infrastructure 
repairs, and after four years, it is now Torgau's turn.  
</P>
<P>
 Already, a call for bids has gone out to demolition contractors. Gerstenberg 
says the wrecking ball could swing as early as May.  
</P>
<P>
 Engineer Klaus Grabein, with the roads and bridges department of the state of 
Saxony, says the steel in the Torgau bridge is too old to be worth saving. And 
repairs made after the departing Nazis dynamited the bridge were poorly done, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But the really fatal feature of the bridge is a stone pylon that rises out of 
the Elbe at midstream. In 1984, a Czech freighter steaming down the river 
misread the currents, hit the pylon and sank. It blocked traffic on the river 
for days -- and the impact to the pylon further weakened the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone else is free to take over the old bridge and preserve it," 
Gerstenberg says, "but whoever does it has to take the middle pylon out." 
</P>
<P>
 Niedersen and Schoene have been scrambling for the funds, but their efforts so 
far have been fruitless. They have been in touch with officials in local, state 
and federal German agencies, and even at the United Nations, which by 
coincidence was founded on the same day as the Torgau link-up. But no one seems 
to agree the bridge is worth saving. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The preservationists also tried sending a letter to the mayor of New Orleans, 
basing a plea for help on a purported Torgau-New Orleans jazz connection. But 
New Orleans has written back that it can't afford to ship a stone bridge across 
the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 Torgau's preservationists have even written President Clinton, asking him to 
come play his saxophone on the bridge, and to the conceptual artist Christo, 
suggesting he "wrap" the bridge, but to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the preservationists' problem is that while the bridge is primarily of 
interest to Americans and Red Army veterans, it stands in Germany. And few 
Germans seem much interested in lavishing funds on a structure that reminds 
them of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conservatives think, for us, this wasn't the hour of victory, it was the hour 
of defeat," Niedersen says. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Town Hall, however, Mayor Gerstenberg says the demolition is strictly a 
matter of money and has nothing to do with banishing Nazi ghosts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if we had the money, I can't imagine spending 9 million marks on the old 
bridge," he says. "There are so many other things to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Grabein, the engineer, says the state of Saxony offered to save one end of the 
bridge for a platform where visitors could look out over the water and 
contemplate the festivities of the hope-filled afternoon half a century before. 
</P>
<P>
 But the preservationists have rejected that plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine if Clinton comes for the 50th anniversary and asks the mayor, 'Where 
is the bridge?' " Niedersen says. "Mr. Gerstenberg would have to say, 'Well, 
this little sign is all there is left.' I just can't imagine that."

MARKET SCENE; AT THE SOLE OF A FOOT-FASHION FAD; THE UBIQUITOUS BOOTS OF DR. 
MARTENS HAVE SHOD EVERYONE FROM SKINHEADS TO THE DALAI LAMA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's an unlikely success story: a working man's boot turned into an object of 
high fashion. But that's the accomplishment of Dr. Martens shoes -- otherwise 
known by aficionados as "DMs" or "Docs." 
</P>
<P>
 Doc Martens first appeared on the international scene in the early 1960s, a 
high-topped jet-black or cherry-red pair of boots -- favored by bovver boys and 
skinheads in London's rough-hewn East End. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, word of DMs spread, and the shoes moved up the social scale. 
Bankers and policemen wore them, and so did Pope John Paul II, the Duke of Kent 
and the Dalai Lama. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, DMs have become a fashion icon, now sported by the likes of 
supermodel Naomi Campbell and pop stars Elton John, Pete Townshend and Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the original DM black boot has been joined by a cornucopia of 150 
styles ranging from low-cut streetwear to steel-toed shoes to hiking boots, 
with 2,000 permutations of color and trim. But all DM's maintain the company's 
trademark, the carefully crafted sole affixed to the uppers by a special 
sealing process. 
</P>
<P>
 Such has been the popularity of the shoe that about 225,000 pairs of DMs are 
produced weekly by the manufacturer, R. Griggs & Co., a family-owned firm in 
Northamptonshire, England. Published figures say the privately held company 
produces an estimated $30-million annual profit on $195 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 And the low-profile father-and-son team behind the success, Max and Stephen 
Griggs, was recently listed in 80th place in the London Sunday Times 
compilation of Britain's richest 500 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Martens shoes have become a standard," boasts Stephen, the managing 
director, calling his product "the Volkswagen Beetle of the shoe world." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our success nowadays is as much as anything the fact that it is so 
deeply ingrained in Britain's subconscious," he says. "It's a part of the 
fabric of the country almost." The company acquired Dr. Martens in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 The original shoe was devised by a German doctor named Klaus Maertens who, 
while convalescing from a skiing accident in the Bavarian town of Seeshaupt, 
decided to make a comfortable shoe to relieve the pain of walking. Together 
with Herbert Funck, an engineer, Maertens designed a shoe with an air-cushioned 
sole, using old tires -- a revolutionary concept at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The sole was the special feature of the shoe. Where soles of most traditional 
men's footwear were stitched to the leather of the upper shoe, Maertens and 
Funck devised a method of heat-sealing the sole to the upper, creating a 
cavity, or air cushion. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was so effective that within two years Maertens and Funck had 
patented and developed the design commercially, and the air-cushioned shoes 
were sold throughout Germany -- chiefly as a "comfort" shoe for elderly women 
with foot trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1959, the new shoes -- which had become know as "Dr. Maertens" -- were 
selling across Europe, and the owners were interested in finding a company to 
produce them in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence an ad in the trade press that the Griggses spotted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griggs family had been involved in shoemaking since 1901 in the 
Northhamptonshire village of Wollaston, where shoes have been produced since 
the 17th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 After World War II, the Griggs brothers in charge at the time -- Bill, Ray and 
Colin -- found they faced tough competition from a dozen other shoe 
manufacturers in the Wollaston area -- as well as from new techniques 
developing elsewhere. The brothers persuaded the local companies to form a 
co-operative, the Wollaston Vulcanizing Co., which was equipped with new 
molding machinery to make vulcanized soles for all the cooperative's members. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Griggs revolution really began in 1959 when Bill Griggs learned of Dr. 
Maertens' desire to license production of his "comfort" shoe in the United 
Kingdom. Impressed by the strategy behind Wollaston Vulcanizing, the Germans 
offered the Griggses the rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The Britons anglicized the name to Dr. Martens and called their own line 
"AirWair." On April 1, 1960, the first pair of British Dr. Martens was produced 
in England. By the mid-1960s, Docs became an essential part of Britain's youth 
culture, and no respecting bovver or skinhead was properly dressed without a 
pair of eight-eyelet Doc Martens "cherry-reds." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the famous "bovver boots" -- the nickname came from their appeal to 
East End toughs -- were also bought in the thousands by workmen and women, 
sold, the Griggses say, on their sheer practicality. 
</P>
<P>
 The company realized the popularity of its industrial footwear when managers 
detected a sudden surge in sales of boys' shoes. The company discovered that 
women were buying boys' sizes -- and quickly introduced Dr. Martens for women. 
</P>
<P>
 DMs remained at the cusp of every trend from the punk look of the 1970s to the 
designer footwear of the 1980s and 1990s. Docs are featured in London's 
Victoria & Albert Museum's permanent exhibition on 20th-Century style and 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Marten shoes have been at the center of British youth culture for 30 
years," says Max Griggs, the chairman. "Now the rest of the world is catching 
on, particularly in the past 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the 1960s, a fourth generation of Griggses, including Max, who is 
Bill's son, joined the company. Max, 55, and Managing Director Stephen, 32, 
represent the fourth and fifth generations of the Griggs family. The Griggs 
Group makes up 23 subsidiary companies that produce the 225,000 pairs of shoes 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Wollaston Vulcanizing continues to make every Dr. Martens sole produced in the 
world. And quality control necessitates five separate inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a secret to DMs? 
</P>
<P>
 On a technical level, an official says: "The unique Dr. Martens 
air-conditioned sole is a combination of honeycombed air compartments and soft 
cushion at the ball of the foot. It absorbs the shocks on rough or uneven 
surfaces, insulates the foot from the cold, and gently supports the foot -- 
making walking seem more like floating on air." 
</P>
<P>
 But DM's have something else. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people no longer see Dr. Martens as fashion," Stephen Griggs says. "They 
are no longer the extreme thing to wear, but are becoming the standard by which 
other shoes are judged. They're good value for money, last well and look good. 
What's more they're quirky and sexy. I'm sure Grandad would be amazed to know 
what he started."

MARKET FOCUS; A GRAIN OF HOPE FOR BATTERED ECONOMIES; A STAPLE FOOD LONG 
REVERED BY INDIGENOUS PEOPLES IN ECUADOR, PERU AND BOLIVIA IS DRAWING WORLDWIDE 
INTEREST.

<P>
 In Ecuador, Nestle is marketing a popular baby cereal made with quinoa. In 
Bolivia, an association of peasant farmers is exporting 350 metric tons of the 
stuff a year to the United States and Europe. In Peru, non-governmental 
organizations are helping highland communities reintroduce quinoa cultivation. 
</P>
<P>
 With a more complete range of proteins in greater concentrations than any 
other grain, quinoa is comparable to milk in nutritional value, experts say. 
Sometimes called the super grain of the Incas, quinoa was a staple throughout 
the Andes for thousands of years. It has been an increasingly neglected crop 
for much of this century, but there are signs of a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Nestle, the Swiss-based food company, invested millions of dollars and seven 
years in Ecuador to develop quinoa as a commercial grain. About four years ago, 
Nestle decided that the cost of promoting consumption on a world scale would be 
too high. Furthermore, a Nestle official said available supplies could not meet 
mass demand and the price of quinoa could not compete with other grains, in 
part because of their larger production levels. 
</P>
<P>
 In some important ways, however, the project was successful. Nestle now makes 
a Nestum baby cereal for the Ecuadorean market with quinoa and honey, and it 
sells better than the company's rice-based Nestum. Meanwhile, whole-grain 
quinoa has become a popular item on supermarket shelves here in the land of the 
ancient Incas, mostly as a soup thickener and rice substitute. 
</P>
<P>
 While experts do not see quinoa as a substitute for wheat, mainly because it 
is not suitable by itself for making bread, it is widely regarded as a 
potentially important source of protein, starch, vitamins and minerals. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, quinoa is a "pseudo-grain" because the plant is not a grass but 
rather is related to spinach. The disc-shaped grain is smaller than rice and 
cooks just as easily. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, the product was unavailable in urban Ecuador except in 
produce markets. The crop was grown mostly by subsistence farmers in the 
highlands and was regarded in the cities as a lowly food for poor Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 That began changing as Nestle's Ecuadorean research center, named Latinreco, 
began developing improved strains of quinoa and more efficient cultivation 
methods in the early 1980s. Then commercial farmers, encouraged by Latinreco, 
began growing and marketing the crop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today if you go into any supermarket, you will find clean, attractive quinoa, 
ready to eat," said Christian Wahli, general manager of Latinreco. 
</P>
<P>
 For its research, Latinreco buys six to 10 metric tons of quinoa a year from 
the country's main producer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fourteen years ago I asked for one ton of quinoa, and there wasn't that much 
in all of Ecuador," Wahli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks in part to Latinreco's research, commercial cultivation of quinoa in 
Ecuador today yields up to five metric tons per acre, triple the production 
with old seeds and methods, he pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 International demand for quinoa has had much to do with its resurgence in the 
economies of Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. As the health food movement expanded 
during the 1980s in the United States and Europe, quinoa was found to be a 
tasty food with impressive nutritional values. Exports of the grain from the 
Andean region began to grow, and the developed world's interest gave quinoa new 
prestige among middle-class consumers in the Andean countries. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, the Quinoa Corporation of Los Angeles is the main 
company dedicated exclusively to marketing quinoa. It sells whole grain mostly 
for cooking but also produces quinoa flour for mixing with other flours, quinoa 
flakes for breakfast food and pastas of quinoa-corn and quinoa-wheat. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other companies, Arrowhead Mills and Eden Foods, also market quinoa 
products nationally. But David Schnorr, president of the Quinoa Corporation, 
said quinoa is "still just scratching the edge of the mainstream" in the U.S. 
consumer market. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnorr said that mass marketing quinoa would require a major investment by a 
big company such as Kellogg, General Mills or Campbell Soup. "They are all 
watching it, but for them to get involved in something like this you would have 
to be able to supply millions of pounds a month at a reasonable price," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, neither North American or South American producers can do that. But 
someday, Schnorr said, he hopes they can and will. "I think quinoa is a grain 
that deserves to be sitting right next to rice and wheat in the marketplace," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Tapia, a Peruvian agronomist, said Peru's crop has increased from about 
30,000 acres in 1989 to more than 50,000 acres now. Most is cultivated by hand 
or with oxen. Peru exports 30 to 40 metric tons of quinoa a year to Japan and 
about 150 tons to the United States, Tapia said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 non-governmental organizations in Peru are helping peasant farmers 
reintroduce or improve quinoa cultivation, the agronomist said. Tapia himself 
works with a group called the Assn. for the Rural Development of Cajamarca in 
the highlands of northern Peru. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the group has reintroduced quinoa to the area, working with about 
1,200 families. 
</P>
<P>
 But he doesn't limit his efforts to Cajamarca. "Wherever I go I take quinoa to 
propagate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bolivia, peasant farmers in the Andean highlands founded the National Assn. 
of Quinoa Producers in 1983 to market the grain both in their country and 
abroad. About 3,000 farmers now belong to the association, which buys between 
20% and 25% of the nation's quinoa production, said Freddy Magne, association 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Magne said the association has plans for increasing exports and for 
industrializing some of its production. Next year, for example, he said it will 
begin marketing quinoa soup mixes and candy bars made with quinoa, honey and 
chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Development Fund has invested more than $1 million in a project to 
install commercial processing plants in the Bolivian highlands. Another 
organization of Bolivian quinoa farmers has received financing from the 
Inter-American Development Bank for processing machinery and tractors. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In the United States, Canada and Europe, a growing number of agricultural 
development specialists are working with quinoa. They have adapted the plant 
through selective breeding and genetic engineering to produce well in western 
Canada, Washington State, southern Colorado, Denmark, Britain and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Benson Agriculture and Food Institute of Utah's Brigham Young University 
is experimenting with quinoa in the Mexican highlands near Puebla. Luis 
Espinoza, a Chilean researcher at the institute, said that U.S. farmers are 
becoming increasingly interested in quinoa as an alternative crop. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had quite a few telephone calls from people all the way from 
California to Nebraska, people who want to grow it," Espinoza said by 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Duane Johnson, a quinoa expert at the agronomy department of Colorado State 
University, estimated that 2,500 acres of quinoa are being grown in Canada's 
Saskatchewan and Alberta provinces and 200 acres in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson introduced quinoa to farmers in the San Luis Valley of southern 
Colorado, where a total of 1,200 acres are now planted with the grain. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the production is sold mostly as health food in the United States, 
Italy, France and Switzerland.

NEXT STEP; ISLAND PARADISE IS UNLOCKED BY PRISON'S DEMISE; PENITENTIARY'S 
DEMOLITION INSPIRES BIG PLANS FOR TOURIST DEVELOPMENT OFF THE COAST OF BRAZIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In this drowsy fishing hamlet, miles from Brazil's bustling mainland, 
villagers sit under broad-leafed amendoeira trees, playing dominoes, drinking 
beer, lost in conversation and in time. They are resplendent in their sandals, 
shorts, T-shirts and beaded bijouterie . 
</P>
<P>
 There are no cars here, no smokestacks or jackhammers to belch or bellow of 
civilization. The loudest noises are the tum-tum-tum of deep-bellied African 
drums and the steady shoosh of waves breaking on the curving beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at this," says Amaury de Souza, a political scientist from Rio de 
Janeiro, the high-strung metropolis 60 miles to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 De Souza has boated to the island to unwind for the weekend with his wife and 
friends. He lifts a chin to the cobblestone promenade where lovers stroll, with 
their arms braided and hips swaying with the crowns of palms in the ocean 
breeze. Hand-painted signs lashed to trees beckon customers to snacks and 
home-cooked meals. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the old Brazil," he says, "a Brazil that doesn't exist anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Year after year, life on Ilha Grande, the Big Island in Portuguese, lying 10 
miles off Brazil's Green Coast, has been like this. Except during Carnival, 
when the island brims with tourists, tranquillity reigns here. Generations have 
savored this peace, content to sit under the stars and sip and sing while 
history rushes by. 
</P>
<P>
 But the days of bliss may be numbered. Late last month, plastic explosives 
brought down the weathered walls of the Candido Mendes prison, a maximum 
security penitentiary on a remote beach of the sprawling, mountainous island. 
For years, the prison had been both the curse and the blessing of Ilha Grande. 
</P>
<P>
 Harboring at times up to 1,000 major felons, the prison served to intimidate 
many tourists and would-be island residents. Prison breaks were routine, and 
old-timers here delight in telling stories of how fugitives occasionally 
terrorized islanders. Yet thanks largely to its infamy, Ilha Grande had 
remained as pristine and peaceful as it was when European navigators first 
sighted it nearly five centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Down with the prison walls came the luxury of isolation. Another sort of 
luxury appears to be on its way -- the kind that travels by jet and yacht, and 
measures life by calories and karats. The governor of Rio de Janeiro, Nilo 
Batista, together with a klatch of investors and hoteliers, has big plans. They 
speak of erecting a five-star hotel on the beach where the prison stood. The 
hotel will be serviced by sea cruisers and have a heliport. 
</P>
<P>
 For many investors, this 78-square-mile island, appointed with mountain peaks 
rising 3,000 feet and necklaced by 105 pearl-white beaches, is a promising 
address. "Growth will be tremendous there," said Nilo Sergio, marketing 
director of Porto Hotels, which owns three hotels on the mainland facing Ilha 
Grande as well as property on the island itself. 
</P>
<P>
 All over the island, property values are starting to soar. Ten years ago, 
Gerard Masse, a French engineer, paid $10,000 for an empty beachfront plot in 
Abraao and built a small, $25-a-room inn, the Pousada Tropicana. "Just the 
other day someone offered me $300,000 for it," he said, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day, someone comes by with an offer," said Janete Dias de Araujo, who 
was born and raised on Ilha Grande and runs its most traditional seafood 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 But the scent of a rich future is already giving the quiet folk at Abraao 
indigestion. "We don't know what is going to happen now," said Araujo. "Today, 
I walk around freely day and night. I never lock my door. It's peaceful. But 
things are changing." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Ilha Grande was never exactly the untouched jewel in the Atlantic its 
champions like to portray. For centuries, it was inhabited by two rival and 
often warring Indian tribes, the Tamoios and Guianas. And Europeans proved no 
less rapacious. Though ignored by the first Portuguese settlers, the island 
became a pirates' paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, though, authorities awoke to the danger on the seas and took 
control. In time, Ilha Grande became a natural way station for sea trade. 
Especially slaves. Brazil bought more slaves than any other country in the New 
World, held them longer and continued to purchase them decades after the slave 
trade was banned elsewhere. Ilha Grande became an entrepot for the smuggling of 
this human contraband. 
</P>
<P>
 When abolition finally came to Brazil, in 1888, the new but unpopular 
republican government looked to Ilha Grande much the way many threatened 
regimes regarded islands the world over: as a dumping ground for bandits and 
misfits. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1893, Army Marshal and Vice President Floriano Peixoto put down a naval 
revolt and dispatched monarchist rebels to the island. It took another 10 years 
for authorities to build the first official prison. 
</P>
<P>
 A second was constructed in 1932, when the populist leader, and later 
dictator, Getulio Vargas exiled the leaders of a rebellion sparked by Sao Paulo 
coffee barons. In the special ways inherited from Lusitanian justice, select 
prisoners were locked away in underground cells, which sometimes flooded to 
neck level when the tide rolled in. 
</P>
<P>
 Famous inmates were confined in the dungeon. Perhaps the most renowned was 
Graciliano Ramos, a writer and Communist jailed by Vargas in 1936. Ramos based 
much of his opus, "Memories of Prison," on his two years on Ilha Grande. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years that followed, democracy came and went like the Atlantic tide in 
Brazil. When it last ebbed, with a coup in 1964, the military regime made the 
island a bin for political dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Brazilian authorities also aided unwittingly in giving birth 
to modern organized crime. During the military years, a law said that all bank 
heists were crimes against national security. So common bank crooks were sent 
to Ilha Grande. There, they mingled freely with ideologues and intellectuals, 
and soon a strange outlaw symbiosis developed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Common bandits learned about organization and tactics from the leftist 
intellectuals," said Eneas Quintal de Oliveira, a former director of the 
Candido Mendes Penitentiary. "They got the know-how with none of the ideology." 
The leftists, for their part, found inspiration in the bravado and street 
smarts of the hardened cons. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, free at last from the specter of these legendary bad hats, island 
residents are eyeing their prisonless future uneasily. 
</P>
<P>
 What troubles locals most is the cavalier attitude of the state authorities, 
who did not deign to consult the residents when they ordered the prison razed. 
The same rash thinking, they fear, may soon touch off an explosion of tourist 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is that the island became a prisoner of the penitentiary. 
What few amenities Ilha Grande enjoys -- electricity, a working pier, housing 
and commerce -- came with government, which came to tend the jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The 100-member police detail has been halved. About 500 public-sector jobs 
will soon be phased out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were born with the prison. We're afraid of what's coming," said Janete de 
Araujo. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some on the island are shedding few tears. One is Elias Lins de Melo, who 
owns the island's oldest inn, Mar da Tranquilidade. "The prison was a blight on 
the island," he said. De Melo wants the island to have an oceanic-research 
center and dreams of carving out trails and campsites for nature and 
"adventure" tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Ezekiel Menezes, the weekend duty officer, stood out before the 
powder-blue police depot at Abraao. He wore shorts and a T-shirt. The lone 
police vehicle was parked nearby, and dusty from underuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robbery, the occasional domestic dispute -- yeah, we have all that," Menezes 
said. "But not much else. It's quiet here." The town he was in charge of 
policing lay spread out before him, as tidy and tranquil as a still life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now with the prison gone, things are going to change. It's like the island is 
a child that's lost his father," he said, digging a sandal in the sand.

NEW PICTURE FOR FORGOTTEN LATINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEVINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nely Galan, already an influential television executive at 30, realized at an 
early age that there was virtually no television programming aimed at 
English-speaking Latinos born in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching Spanish-language television, she found that "the stories had nothing 
to do with us," and she saw few Latinos on mainstream English-language shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "You grow up and you say to yourself, something's wrong with this picture," 
says the Cuban-born Galan, whose family moved to Teaneck, N.J., when she was 4. 
"We're not on American TV. We're not on Spanish TV. We're like the lost 
generation. Nobody sees us anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 After beginning her television career at 18 as host of a PBS teen-oriented 
news show, Galan turned this realization and her knowledge of the Latino market 
into an entertainment industry success story. By 22, she was the station 
manager of WNJU, a New Jersey Spanish-language television station. Now, through 
Tropix, her joint venture with HBO, she's producing programming for U.S. and 
Latin American stations and helping determine the creative direction for ESPN's 
and Fox's Latin American cable channels. She also hosts E! Entertainment 
Network's "The Gossip Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Tropix's first English-language program, "Loco Slam!," which will showcase 
Latino comics the way "Def Comedy Jam" showcases black ones, will premiere at 
midnight June 3 on HBO. An as yet untitled anthology series about three 
immigrant families -- one Cuban, one Puerto Rican and one Mexican -- is set to 
go into production for HBO late this summer. Tropix will also produce 
programming for network television, and now has two situation comedies in 
development at ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 "The unifying theme is that we're all second-generation Latinos," says Galan 
of the programming she plans to produce. "(We're) children of immigrants, and 
the comedy comes from that." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Galan's status as one of television's youngest powerful executives, 
her office in HBO's Century City West Coast headquarters is anything but 
traditionally corporate. A bright plastic nine-foot palm tree sits in the 
corner, and Mexican milagros crosses hang on the wall with "The Day of the 
Dead," a colorful painting by Chicano artist Mark Sanchez. On her bookshelf, 
such corporate takeover stories as "Barbarians at the Gate" share space with 
Gabriel Garcia Marquez's "Love in the Time of Cholera." 
</P>
<P>
 The young mogul talks excitedly about Tropix's new projects and her plan, 
which is currently being negotiated, to produce "The Gossip Show" in Spanish 
for Fox's Latin American cable channel. She takes three sugars in a 
late-afternoon espresso and admits that she rarely takes time to relax.  
</P>
<P>
 Much of what little free time she does have, she says, is spent attending 
Latin American cultural events. "It's my obsession," she says of her culture. 
"I really do live my life like this. I really do love to go to Latin music 
events. I really do read Latin American literature." 
</P>
<P>
 Galan was producing mainstream television documentaries for CBS in Boston when 
she took the job with WNJU in New Jersey, partly, she says, because the move 
would give her an excuse to get a divorce (she has not remarried). At first 
apprehensive about working for a small station, she had what she calls "a 
religious experience," finding Latino programming more rewarding.  
</P>
<P>
 When WNJU was sold three years later, Galan left the station and hosted 
"Bravo," a talk show for CBS. She then worked at what she jokingly calls her 
"waitress job" -- hosting such network programs and specials as NBC's "House 
Party," Fox's "Good Day New York" and PBS' "Amigos." While consulting with HBO 
about its Latin American ventures, Galan got a call from Chris Albrecht, the 
president of HBO Independent Productions, about developing original programming 
aimed at the Latino audience.  
</P>
<P>
 "I said to myself: If you put all this together in a company, it makes sense," 
says Galan. "If you launch a channel, that channel needs programming; then you 
produce the programming for that channel. If you do a sitcom in the United 
States, you have a place to sell it in Latin America."  
</P>
<P>
 Galan then started Tropix, which she brought to HBO as a joint venture at the 
end of 1992. According to Albrecht, HBO has been pleased with Tropix and the 
work done by its principals, Galan and Augusto Failde.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think Nely has fantastic instincts for what people want," said Albrecht, 
who is also a senior vice president of HBO. "She has an instinct for quality, 
and yet she also understands commercial needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Galan hopes to produce quality programming that speaks to her audience and 
she's aware that it's an audience advertisers very much want to reach. "My 
dream is to create Motown Latino," she says, referring to her desire to be both 
culturally significant and financially successful. "That's my mission in life."

 When composer-lyricist William Finn first moved here in the late '70s, he used 
to pack everybody he knew into his apartment and literally put on a show. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, he's still writing musicals in the same cluttered place on New 
York's Upper West Side. But his audiences don't fit into the bedroom and 
hallway anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 First Off-Broadway, then on Broadway and around the country, Finn's 
idiosyncratic musicals have gone from cult favorites to honored mainstream 
entertainment. "Falsettos," Finn's Tony-winning musical about love, family and 
friendship in a time of AIDS, opens Thursday at Hollywood's Doolittle Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-written and directed by James Lapine, "Falsettos" combines two of Finn's 
earlier one-act musicals about Marvin, a neurotic charmer with an amazing 
extended family. And as the show's opening number, "Four Jews in a Room 
Bitching," makes perfectly clear, "Falsettos" is no traditional Broadway 
musical. 
</P>
<P>
 Finn and Lapine introduce us to not just Marvin, but Marvin's male lover, 
ex-wife, son, psychiatrist and neighbors. The lesbian couple next-door proffers 
" nouvelle bar mitzvah cuisine," the psychiatrist does a soft-shoe to refrains 
of "Everyone Hates His Parents," and Marvin's lover, Whizzer, comes down with a 
terrible illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Finn, 42, was the first person to play Marvin, a character he has been writing 
about since the '70s but swears isn't autobiographical. "I think all the 
characters are sort of me. The kid certainly is. The wife is, in many ways. 
Mendel (the psychiatrist). Whizzer not so much. He's too good-looking. I would 
never think I was that good-looking." 
</P>
<P>
 That's how Finn, who is in fact nice-looking, talks. At 6-foot-2, bearded, 
sometimes heavier than other times, Finn is a bear of a man who, like 
"Falsettos," can be hysterically funny one moment, profoundly serious the next. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a wild emotionalism to the way Billy writes that is reflected in his 
music," says actor Chip Zien, who has played one part or another in Finn's 
shows since the late '70s. "There's a sense of abandonment about his material 
that's tremendous fun for an actor to perform."  
</P>
<P>
 Trace it back to Finn's childhood, and his first-grade desire to be a singing 
pediatrician. Raised in suburban Boston as "the oldest and least mature" of 
three children, Finn got started in music when he received a guitar as a bar 
mitzvah gift. He later moved on to piano, on which he says he is primarily 
self-taught. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Sondheim's musical "Company" so inspired Finn that he went off to 
Williams College, Sondheim's alma mater. At Williams, he also won the 
Hutchinson Fellowship for musical composition that Sondheim won years before, 
and turned out three musicals. (College student Finn also talked his way into 
Sondheim's home at one point, eventually leaving with some encouragement.)  
</P>
<P>
 Not long after Finn graduated from Williams in 1974, he wound up in New York, 
temp typing by day, composing by night. By 1979, he'd produced "In Trousers," 
the show that kicked off what has become "the Marvin trilogy" and got Finn 
hooked up with the Off-Broadway house Playwrights Horizons. Playwrights later 
produced "March of the Falsettos," which played the Doolittle (then the 
Huntington Hartford) in 1982, and "Falsettoland" as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a wild exuberance and naivete with 'March of the Falsettos,' " says 
Zien, who, as on Broadway, plays psychiatrist Mendel at the Doolittle. "We 
didn't know AIDS existed then. 'Falsettoland' reflects a maturity and awareness 
none of us had then." 
</P>
<P>
 Finn and Lapine, who is also a frequent Sondheim collaborator, put the two 
shows together as "Falsettos" for Broadway in April, 1992. Falsetto, defines 
Finn, "is the voice above the normal range. I wanted a musical title, and I 
thought these people were outside the normal range."  
</P>
<P>
 "Falsettos" ran 14 months on Broadway, closing about a year ago. It got great 
reviews, two Tonys and was the subject of a unique advertising campaign that 
featured everyone from rabbis and nuns to high school students and tourists 
touting the show's virtues. 
</P>
<P>
 Timing helps, of course. Since "Falsettos" first opened, "Angels in America" 
went to Broadway, the TV film "And the Band Played On" aired on HBO and the 
motion picture "Philadelphia" was released. Even Finn concedes that while 
people may still be "alienated" by his subject matter, the times have "more or 
less" caught up with his work. 
</P>
<P>
 Heterosexuals write to him, Finn says, "that they didn't know anyone who's gay 
but should they meet anyone, they'll know how to act -- it's not so 
frightening." And closeted homosexuals, he says, have taken their families to 
the show as a way of coming out.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is the first time, or one of the first times, where 
homosexuality was not treated as an aberration. It was just assumed. These 
characters had already dealt with any problems they might have recognizing what 
they were. The homosexuality was already an inextricable part of their lives 
that was neither to be discussed nor argued over." 
</P>
<P>
 Finn told his own family about his gayness indirectly, asking them to pay for 
a therapist while he was living in California just after college. When they 
asked why, he told them "you don't wanna know. I knew they would know exactly. 
And when I walked in my house, after I'd been in California, my mother asked, 
'Are you gay?' And I said, 'Yes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "In Trousers" is dedicated to his parents, sister and brother, but Finn has 
long used his musicals to redefine both what a family is and how it's supposed 
to act. Family, says Finn, "is the people who, when you need them, are there."  
</P>
<P>
 For Finn, family just starts with his parents and siblings. "Falsettoland" is 
dedicated to businessman Arthur Salvadore, with whom Finn has lived for maybe 
13 years -- so long, Finn quips, that they fight about exactly how long -- and 
the composer's bookcases and tables are filled with photos and memorabilia of 
his wide, supportive network of friends.  
</P>
<P>
 Asked if there will be more shows about Marvin's family -- aside from a film 
of "Falsettos" he is currently working on with Lapine -- Finn thinks it 
unlikely. Besides, he's busy now with a musical version of Edna Ferber and 
George S. Kaufman's 1927 comedy "The Royal Family." 
</P>
<P>
 " 'The Royal Family of Broadway' is much more mainstream than 'Falsettos,' " 
says Finn's collaborator, TV and film writer Kenny Solms. "He's always wanted 
to do a big, brassy musical with rich, larger than life characters. This is 
going to be his 'Hello, Dolly!' -- but with no runway." 
</P>

HOW HITCHCOCK FOUGHT NAZIS; THE MASTER MADE TWO PROPAGANDA FILMS THAT HAVEN'T 
BEEN SEEN HERE, UNTIL NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even the most ardent Alfred Hitchcock buffs, who know every twist and turn of 
every film and TV episode the master of suspense presented, are in for a 
surprising cinematic treat next month with the release on video of two short 
Hitchcock films never before seen in the Unites States. 
</P>
<P>
 The intricately plotted films -- the 26-minute "Bon Voyage" and the 31-minute 
"Aventure Malgache" -- were made in 1944 when, at the request of the British 
Ministry of Information, Hitchcock returned to England from Hollywood to make 
anti-Nazi propaganda movies. The bilingual Hitchcock was asked to film the 
movies in French, so they could be smuggled into Occupied France to be shown to 
Resistance fighters there. But the films, which the ministry ultimately deemed 
"too subversive" and cynical to be used as propaganda films, have languished in 
the possession of the British government since the '40s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Hitchcock fans will also be able to see them on the big screen, 
May 11 and 12 at the New Beverly Cinema, which will do full justice to the 
films' superb black-and-white cinematography by Gunther Krampf, a German who 
was then in exile in Britain. The films, a cooperative venture of Milestone 
Film & Video in New York and the British Film Institute, are both in French and 
carry English subtitles provided by British film scholar Tom Milne. 
</P>
<P>
 When British officials finally screened the two films, not too surprisingly, 
they were stunned to learn they had been given something quite different from 
what they had bargained for. The films are subtle, intricate, carefully 
detailed film noir, models of compression and resourcefulness (and clearly show 
the work of Hitchcock at his prime, coming as they do between "Shadow of a 
Doubt" and "Spellbound"), with Hitchcock clearly relishing pushing the limits 
of exceeding a limited budget (Hitchcock himself was paid a nominal fee) and 
shooting schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The films were shot between Jan. 20, 1944, and Feb. 25, 1944, at the 
Associated British Studios at Welwyn Garden City. Both featured members of the 
Moliere Players, a French exile group that included many amateur actors, many 
of whose families were still in France.  
</P>
<P>
 In the first, "Bon Voyage," a young Scottish RAF gunner (British actor John 
Blythe), who has escaped from a POW camp in Germany, makes his way to London, 
where he is interviewed by an officer of the Free French Intelligence. In 
flashback, the gunner, Sgt. Dougal, who's amusingly always hungry, tells how he 
was helped by another escapee, a Pole, and made his way through France with the 
help of the Resistance.  
</P>
<P>
 When the officer tells the sergeant that the Pole was really a Vichy spy out 
to uncover as many members of the Resistance as possible, this triggers a 
rerun, in flashback, of the sergeant's journey, which takes on a whole new 
meaning, with many subtle details revealed. At once a homage to the Resistance 
and a cautionary tale, "Bon Voyage" was actually smuggled into France during 
the war, where it had limited exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bon Voyage" was written by J.O.C. Orton and Angus McPhail from an idea by 
Arthur Calder-Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1967, Hitchcock told Francois Truffaut, in their book-length interview, 
that during the making of "Bon Voyage" he had to bear in mind the serious 
hardships faced by the French who were his intended audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "In (one) shot, I showed a restaurant. Ordinarily you would never think about 
the look of a table where a meal has been finished. But in representing a 
French restaurant of the day, you did. There are no crusts left on the table. 
If I permitted anything like that, it would simply mean to future French 
audiences that the people who made the picture didn't know what they were 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 He also learned, he told Truffaut, how divided the Free French really were. 
That essential conflict became the subject of "Aventure Galgache," in which a 
French lawyer, formerly a resident of Madagascar, plays himself in a 
dramatization of his experiences helping compatriots escape to join De Gaulle. 
The lawyer, Clarousse, tells his story with much humor to his fellow actors in 
a dressing room of the Moliere Player's theater; this device allows Hitchcock 
to cut back to the dressing room for some quick exposition and to underline the 
satirical tone with which he treats the lawyer's enemies, a corrupt group loyal 
to the Vichy Government.  
</P>
<P>
 Written by Hitchcock with noted French actor Claude Dauphin, "Aventure 
Malgache," although it saluted the heroism of Clarousse and others, revealed 
the ambiguity and treachery among the French themselves to an extent surely not 
equaled until Marcel Ophuls' 1970 documentary "The Sorrow and the Pity." 
Naturally this was further than the Ministry of Information had intended the 
film to go and "Aventure Malgache" never made it to France. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Hitchcock O'Connell, the director's daughter, reached by phone at her 
home in Solvang, said that while she didn't remember her father's talking much 
about the films, she remembers clearly how she and her mother had to stay 
behind in Bel-Air while her father traveled to war-torn London. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitchcock originally was to make his shorts for American audiences rather than 
for the French. Yet it was David O. Selznick who, when asked his opinion of the 
films, declared that they were "too inferior" for the U.S. market. And when the 
British government requested the services of Hitchcock, Selznick, to whom he 
was under contract, balked at releasing his greatest director and finally 
relented -- only with the proviso that while in London Hitchcock would at the 
same time continue working on the script for "Spellbound."

 OK, so you can't afford a nanny. But for about $20, starting today you can 
have your own "Mrs. Doubtfire."FoxVideo has shipped 9 million units, so there 
shouldn't be a shortage. By the way, the film has taken in more than $400 
million worldwide. Who said cross-dressing doesn't pay?

FIGHTING TO KEEP MOVIES AS THEIR MAKERS INTENDED; ARTS: A NONPROFIT GROUP THAT 
BATTLES AGAINST FILM ALTERATION WILL HOLD A THREE-DAY SYMPOSIUM STARTING 
WEDNESDAY TO DEBATE THIS AND RELATED ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Artists Rights Foundation wants you to know that the movies you're 
watching on television and on video may not be the same movies your friends 
raved about after seeing them in theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 After films leave theaters, they may be compressed, cut and colorized before 
they make it to the small screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Such tinkerings have long stuck in the craws of directors, cinematographers 
and other artists who worked on the film, yet altered copies of their films 
carry no record of their objections. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be about to change. The nonprofit Artists Rights Foundation, which 
was incorporated in 1989 with support from the creative guilds, grew partly out 
of the debate in the '80s over colorization of classic black-and-white movies. 
The organization is now concerned with all types of film alteration, and it 
will hold the first International Artists Rights Symposium, on Wednesday, 
Thursday and Friday at the Hotel Nikko, to debate this issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The symposium will include panels on the rights of filmmakers as artists, the 
effect emerging technologies will have on film alteration, and the consumer's 
right to know about how films may have been changed. Panelists will include 
director Milos Forman and Disney studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, as well as 
other film artists, studio executives and intellectual property experts. 
</P>
<P>
 The event will conclude Friday with a dinner hosted by Steven Spielberg, 
George Lucas and Anjelica Huston, at which Spielberg will present the recently 
created John Huston Award for Artists Rights to director Fred Zinnemann. 
</P>
<P>
 Under U.S. law, the copyright holder of a work generally is considered to be 
its legal author and has complete control over it. Those who hold a film's 
copyright legally have the right to change it in almost any way they wish. 
</P>
<P>
 Awarding legal authorship of a film to its owner -- in the case of a film, to 
the studio rather than its director, writer or producer -- is "the same as 
saying the Pope painted the Sistine Chapel," said Frank Pierson, a member of 
the foundation's board of trustees and the president of the Writers Guild of 
America West. "We would like to see a situation where a film is recognized as 
the work of the creators of the film." 
</P>
<P>
 The Artist Rights Foundation argues that alterations to films damages their 
artistic integrity; it is currently lobbying Congress to pass the Film 
Disclosure Act, which would require altered versions of films to carry labels 
clearly explaining how they were changed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Motion Picture Assn. of America, which represents the major studios, says 
this system of copyright ownership encourages investment in film by enabling 
copyright owners to make the changes necessary to put their films on the small 
screen, thereby helping to guarantee a return on a risky investment.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you inject into this another area of uncertainty, the money will be 
diminished," said Jack Valenti, president of the MPAA. "The only way you can 
survive in the marketplace is to move briskly through videotape, pay-per-view, 
cable (and) television." 
</P>
<P>
 The MPAA recently began a system to voluntarily label altered films, but the 
Artists Rights Foundation says those labels don't offer enough information. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Artists Rights Foundation symposium will be held at the Hotel Nikko, 465 
S. La Cienega Blvd., Los Angeles. The symposium and the dinner are open to the 
public. Cost is $125 per day or $300 for all three days. Tickets to the John 
Huston Award dinner are $250 each. For reservations, call (310) 246-2012.

'TRAFFORD TANZI' AMONG 6 PLAYS PLANNED FOR SAN DIEGO REP SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 San Diego Repertory Theatre will present the musical "Trafford Tanzi," Claire 
Luckham's literal battle between the sexes in a wrestling ring, "A Christmas 
Carol" and "Hamlet" as part of its six-play 1994-95 season at the Lyceum Stage 
and Space in San Diego's Horton Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's artistic director, Douglas Jacobs, will direct "Trafford Tanzi" 
in the 250-seat Lyceum Space, which will be converted to a theater in the round 
to accommodate the fight.Productions have not been assigned dates yet, but 
tentative scheduling for "Trafford Tanzi" is in the fall, with "A Christmas 
Carol" running in December (the director to be announced) and "Hamlet," under 
the direction of associate artistic director Todd Salovey, in January, both on 
the 565-seat Lyceum Stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Martin's "Keely & Du," a tale about the kidnaping of a pregnant woman 
from an abortion clinic by abortion opponents, is likely to end the season, 
Jacobs said last week. Producing director Sam Woodhouse will direct in the 
Space. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jacobs, either Lorraine Hansberry's "A Raisin in the Sun" or 
Aishah Rahman's "The Mojo and the Sayso" will be directed by UC San Diego 
professor Floyd Gaffney on the Lyceum Stage in the fall. To complete the 
season, Luis Santeiro's "Our Lady of the Tortilla" or Octavio Solis' "Prospect" 
will be staged on the Lyceum Space in the spring as the company's annual Teatro 
Sin Fronteras project. The director will be announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rep will enter its 19th year with a budget of $1.78 million, including a 
surplus of nearly $40,000, its second consecutive surplus. It will be used to 
help reduce the company's accumulated deficit of $240,000, Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Subscriptions will be sold in blocks of three or six plays. Information: (619) 
235-8025.

WEEKEND BOX OFFICE; 'GIRLS' BADDER THAN THE COMPETITION

 In peak moviegoing periods, a $5-million gross for the weekend might be good 
enough for seventh or eighth place in the Top 10. But during a slow period, as 
now, $5 million is all it takes to be No. 1.And so "Bad Girls," a tale of four 
prostitutes in the Old West, made it to the top in its opening weekend with a 
$5-million gross. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides "Bad Girls," the weekend's other new movies--"The Inkwell" from 
Disney's Touchstone's division, "Brainscan" from Triumph and "Chasers" from 
Warner Bros.--failed to make much of a commercial impression. "Chasers," on 782 
screens, only grossed $733,859.  
</P>
<P>

surpass the all-time box-office record for a foreign-language movie playing in

TAY'S ACCUSED KILLER IS MENTALLY ILL, JURY TOLD; COURTS: A PSYCHOLOGIST 
TESTIFYING FOR THE DEFENSE CLAIMS ROBERT CHAN -- WHO ALLEGEDLY MASTERMINDED THE 
1992 SLAYING OF THE 17-YEAR-OLD STUDENT -- IS SUFFERING FROM PARANOID 
SCHIZOPHRENIA.

<P>
 The 19-year-old accused of masterminding the killing of 17-year-old student 
Stuart A. Tay suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and was convinced Tay had 
rigged his home with explosives that could detonate at any time, a psychologist 
testified Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Chan of Fullerton also heard voices in his head, believed that 
dangerous people lived in his attic and feared that Tay was a member of the CIA 
and an Asian Mafia gang that Chan believed was following him, according to 
clinical psychologist Francis M. Crinella. 
</P>
<P>
 Crinella told jurors that Chan believed "Stuart Tay had unusual powers and 
knew information about Robert no one else knew." Chan's mental illness left him 
convinced that "virtually anything that happened was orchestrated by the 
victim," Crinella said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone has it in for me," Crinella quoted Chan as saying repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 But under intense cross-examination by the prosecution, Crinella also told the 
Orange County Superior Court jury that his diagnosis would be flawed if Chan 
was lying and feigning illness. The psychologist added that the psychiatric 
disorder does not prevent Chan from knowing that murder is a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan is charged with plotting the 1992 slaying because he feared Tay was going 
to double-cross him in a planned computer heist, according to the prosecution. 
But the defense contends that Chan's mental condition caused him to believe 
that he had to kill Tay before Tay killed him. 
</P>
<P>
 No evidence has been presented during the three-week trial that Tay was trying 
to kill Chan. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant is expected to testify today, and jurors could begin 
deliberating as early as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three others charged in the case, Abraham Acosta, 17, of Buena Park and Mun 
Bong Kang, 19, and Kirn Young Kim, 18, both of Fullerton, will go on trial 
after Chan's case concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 The key prosecution witness was a fifth youth, Charles Choe, 18, of Fullerton, 
who pleaded guilty to his role in the slaying and testified against Chan. The 
accused murderers attended Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay, a student at Foothill High School in Santa Ana, was beaten before rubbing 
alcohol was forced down his throat and his mouth and nose were taped shut. He 
was buried in Acosta's back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Crinella said Chan experiences auditory hallucinations and seemed especially 
fixated on scenes from the television show "Twilight Zone." 
</P>
<P>
 The laugh of a girl who turns out to be a giant alien toying with humans as if 
they were ants repeatedly plays itself out in Chan's head, Crinella said. The 
phrase "To Serve Mankind," which refers to another episode in which humans find 
out too late that aliens are interested in eating -- not helping -- them, also 
runs through his mind, the psychologist said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crinella told jurors that Chan's family also has a history of mental illness.

GSA CHIEF'S DEBT MINOR, AUDIT SHOWS; EXPENSES: ROGER JOHNSON OWED GOVERNMENT 
$72 AND HAS PAID IT. OFFICE SAYS HIS 'UNFAMILIARITY WITH OFFICIAL TRAVEL RULES' 
CAUSED THE BLUNDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A second government audit of General Administration chief Roger W. Johnson's 
travel expenses has concluded he owed the government $72 for improperly using 
his government credit card and mixing personal and commercial trips, but he 
already has paid the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The GSA inspector general's office blamed the former Orange County 
businessman's "unfamiliarity with official travel rules" for most of the 
mistakes but raps his knuckles, nonetheless, for the series of administrative 
blunders. 
</P>
<P>
 While his official debt to the government is modest, the episode has been an 
embarrassment for the former chief executive of Western Digital. He has already 
paid $807 back to the government based on a previous, more stringent audit of 
the same travel vouchers by the GSA's chief financial officer. That $807 
included the $72 debt listed by the inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
 GSA spokesman Hap Connors explained that the audit by Chief Financial Officer 
Dennis J. Fischer released March 17 "used a higher standard . . . and focused 
on any travel expense that was unclear or gave the appearance of 
misunderstanding." The inspector general's audit was more basic, Connors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was at a conference in Atlanta on Monday and was unavailable for 
comment. But Connors said the inspector general's report "highlighted needed 
changes in GSA travel regulations that had been suspected by the chief 
financial officer and have since been corrected. The bottom line is that 
Johnson has already written a check for $807 because he wanted to resolve the 
entire issue and get back to bigger tasks, like reshaping the GSA." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, one of only a few Republicans named to a high-level post in the 
Clinton Administration, was confirmed last July. Connors has previously 
described the scrutiny of the travel expenses as an attempt to discredit 
Johnson over his efforts to restructure the $60-billion agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's series of missteps, Connors said, "resulted from a lack of 
understanding about GSA regulations, as opposed to those in the private sector. 
The whole inquiry gave added impetus to fine-tuning those regulations." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the trips in question were diversions to his Laguna Beach home while 
on official business in the region. The audit specifically refers to two 
departures -- Salt Lake City to Seattle and Orange County to Washington -- as 
"deviations from official travel for personal use." The $72 represents the 
difference between the government-approved rates for the travel and the 
slightly higher commercial rates Johnson obtained. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson called for the internal audit after the Wall Street Journal raised 
questions about the travel records in mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspector general's audit, dated April 20 but released Monday, covered 13 
travel vouchers between July 7, 1993 and March 18, 1994. In a addition to 
calling for the $72 reimbursement, the inspector general asked Johnson to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Use government air fares and government credit cards only for official 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
 * Submit all outstanding vouchers and future vouchers "within prescribed time 
frames." 
</P>
<P>
 * Establish a file "to support the official nature of each trip and 
deviations." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Johnson announced he also planned to repay the government $256 for 
184 long-distance phone calls and 39 overnight pieces of mail that his staff 
determined to be for personal use. 
</P>
<P>
 The GSA manages the government's vast real estate holdings and does much of 
its purchasing.

THE NEIGHBORHOOD BEAT; GARDEN GROVE COMMUNITY POLICING PROGRAM STRESSES 
PREVENTION OVER ARRESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Officer Mark Elizondo peered into the green, swamp-like water of an apartment 
complex swimming pool on Stuart Drive that had become an unlikely home for 
three mallards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The Loch Ness monster could live in there for all we know," Elizondo said, 
shaking his head in disgust at the stagnant water. "The ducks think it's a 
pond." 
</P>
<P>
 As he does with just about everything else that goes on in the neighborhood, 
Elizondo is involved in efforts to get the landlord to clean the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not normally the role of the police, Elizondo said, as he continued his 
foot patrol of the three-block neighborhood, "but we are trying to keep this 
place clean. A neighborhood that's not well-kept is going to attract 
undesirables." 
</P>
<P>
 Elizondo, who has been freed of all other duty, is assigned exclusively to the 
neighborhood as the department moves toward community policing, a concept that 
makes officers responsible for a small geographic area, where they can 
concentrate on the needs of residents, address the causes of crime and fear and 
build a partnership with the community. The philosophy emphasizes crime 
prevention over arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Community Policing: Garden Grove Style" was launched as a pilot project in 
January, 1993, in the city's Palma Vista neighborhood and is gradually being 
expanded to include other troubled neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have officers working beats who are making differences in neighborhoods 
with little more than the community policing philosophy behind them," said Lt. 
Scott Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
 By July, the department hopes to have three full-time community policing teams 
-- with two officers each -- working in two other yet-to-be-named 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The community policing drive received a boost last December when Garden Grove 
was among the 74 cities nationwide awarded federal grants to hire additional 
police officers. The city is using its $593,533 to hire six officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizondo, 30, will work in the Stuart Drive neighborhood for at least 18 
months. Assigned there six weeks ago, largely because he is able to speak 
Spanish in a neighborhood where 82% of the residents are Latino, he has become, 
in effect, a manager of the community. Elizondo, an eight-year veteran, knows 
many residents by name and has organized activities such as a neighborhood 
cleanup day -- which drew more than 300 volunteers, a Girl Scout troop and a 
job fair for residents, which takes place Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm behind him 100%," said Isaac Thomas, who has lived in the neighborhood 
for 18 years. "I've never had a bad feeling about police, but I only used to 
see them when they were driving around, giving tickets or arresting somebody. 
(Elizondo) is getting to know people in the neighborhood and getting to know 
what they are about." 
</P>
<P>
 The high-density Stuart Drive neighborhood, with its 51 apartment buildings on 
about 12 acres, was built more than 30 years ago. In recent years, it has 
become increasingly plagued by drugs and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The community policing effort began here in November with the police 
department setting up shop in a studio apartment in the heart of the 
neighborhood. It gives the local team an operating base and residents a local 
place where they can contact the police department. 
</P>
<P>
 A random sampling of residents finds some who say they have already noticed a 
reduction in crime and noise, and a better overall appearance of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before they started patrolling, it was getting kind of rough with drug deals 
and wanna-be gang members," said Thomas, 41. "There's still some stuff going on 
but they have slowed it down a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Mae Chandler, 77, said she had become afraid to leave her apartment after dark 
but now feels somewhat safer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our neighborhood needed it badly," she said. "The officers have been a good 
addition to our street and I appreciate it very much." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, a 17-year resident of Stuart Drive, said she was initially taken 
aback to see police officers wearing a uniform of jeans, polo shirts and tennis 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they first came here, I looked at them kind of funny when I saw them in 
blue jeans," Chandler said, chuckling. "But, by golly, they have the right to 
be comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 The casual look is unusual, but, Elizondo said, "I think people find it much 
less intimidating." 
</P>
<P>
 Developing a rapport and trust takes time, he said. He feels he made a 
breakthrough last month when he and his former partner, Anthony Albini, held 
the cleanup day, which included a barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that was the first time they saw officers in a different light," 
Elizondo said. "We were out there working without our uniforms. I think it 
showed the people that we were sincere in our efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 Elizondo is working with other city departments, such as code enforcement and 
community development, and has also contacted the area's 27 individual 
landlords seeking their cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-range plans for the neighborhood -- near Garden Grove Boulevard and 
Newhope Street -- include the construction of enclosures for unsightly trash 
receptacles, lighting of alleys, transforming garages into carports and 
possibly building a neighborhood park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to stay here until we feel this is a nice, livable place," 
Elizondo said. "When the area can maintain itself and function like any other 
neighborhood, then, we'll leave." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the citywide switch in policing philosophy, Lt. Hamilton said the 
department's 175 sworn officers are not only encouraged to get more involved 
with residents on their beats, but they are required to turn in a monthly 
report outlining what community-policing activities or problem solving they 
have done. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some people here who are obviously more involved than others, 
whether it's personality or talent," Hamilton said. "But I haven't noticed any 
real resistance. I think officers on patrol are buying into it real well." 
</P>
<P>
 The department is proud of the results of the community policing effort so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
 No figures are yet available for accomplishments in Stuart Drive. But during 
the five months in 1993 -- January to May -- when the program was tried in the 
Palma Vista neighborhood, police reported a reduction in car break-ins, fights, 
graffiti and vandalism. In a survey conducted in May, 1993, 40% of the 
residents said they felt safe in the neighborhood compared to 23% in January of 
that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Another example of improvements from the approach, say police, is the work of 
Officer Todd Elgin, who is credited with making vast improvements in his patrol 
area, the Yucca-Sage neighborhood near Harbor Boulevard and Chapman Avenue. 
Hamilton cites it as an example of how adopting community policing can help 
even when an officer is not relieved of his other duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Elgin organized a cleanup day and barbecue and arranged for a Santa Claus to 
visit at Christmas with gifts for underprivileged children in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the most part, we have gone out and put Band-Aids on situations and drive 
away," Elgin said. "Within days or even within hours, the situation would 
recur. Now, we are looking for ways to solve the problems."

DRIVERS, FARM WORKERS PAY PRICE OF LATE STORM; WEATHER: FREEWAYS AND STRAWBERRY 
FIELDS ARE A MESS. SHOWERS COULD LINGER THROUGH WEDNESDAY, WHEN RICHARD NIXON 
IS BURIED.

 Motorists slid out of control. Farm workers picking strawberries gave up 
because of the mud. And many wondered how the cold rains that swept into Orange 
County on Monday might affect the funeral for former President Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 The unseasonably late April showers that caused problems throughout Orange 
County could continue through Wednesday, the day of Nixon's funeral. There is a 
30% chance that light showers or drizzle will fall that day, according to 
WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Weather Service is forecasting a continued chance of showers or 
thunderstorms today, with highs in the upper 50s to middle 60s. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an unusually strong storm for this late in the season," said Curtis 
Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData. 
</P>
<P>
 A cold front moved into the Southland early Monday, bringing with it colder 
temperatures and some light showers, with highs reaching the upper 50s and low 
60s. Winds gusted about 15 m.p.h. Up to one-half inch of rain fell on valleys 
and coastal areas, according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm caused its share of problems locally. 
</P>
<P>
 Police reported a number of rain-related accidents throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 About 12:30 p.m., a 10-vehicle pileup in Orange blocked the southbound Costa 
Mesa Freeway, north of Chapman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The freeway was blocked from the shoulder to the center divider," stopping 
traffic for 45 minutes, said Battalion Chief Reymundo Montoya of the Orange 
Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 One person was taken to UCI Medical Center with serious injuries, and several 
others less seriously hurt were taken to St. Joseph Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The showers also meant trouble for local strawberry growers, who were forced 
to stop harvesting their sensitive crops by noon because of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept going, but it finally got to a point where it was too muddy to 
continue," said Alan Reynolds, president of the Orange County Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no estimates of any damage done to the crop, Reynolds said. In 
addition to stopping work, the rain poses increased rot problems for the 
berries. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County growers produce about 15% of the state's strawberries and were 
hurt severely last year by rains. 
</P>
<P>
 The showers Monday, however, did not cause slides or flooding in fire-scarred 
sections of Laguna Beach and Anaheim Hills, according to fire officials. Laguna 
Beach officials didn't have to open up their emergency command station, a 
fixture during previous storms.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; SWIMMERS WARNED ABOUT STORM DRAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Beach-goers should avoid the water near storm drains for up to 72 hours after 
rainfall because of fecal bacteria and other waste products being washed into 
the ocean, the Orange County Health Agency warned on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among materials being flushed into the ocean are animal wastes, fertilizers, 
road oils and litter, said Robert E. Merryman, director of the health agency. 
</P>
<P>
 After rains, the level of potentially unhealthful bacteria in ocean waters can 
be particularly high. Swimmers and beach-goers should take special care to 
avoid storm drains, rivers and creeks that feed into the ocean, Merryman said. 
</P>
<P>
 With separate pipe systems, sewage drains are not normally a problem after 
rains, he said.FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 25 RESIDENTS TO LEARN OF POLICE 
OPERATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-five residents start class Wednesday in a special, new "academy" 
designed to help people learn more about police operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Called "Citizen Academy," the training consists of 11 consecutive Wednesday 
night classes at the Huntington Beach Police Department.Sessions usually extend 
from 6 to 9:30 p.m. Participants volunteer for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's beneficial for people in the community to know about what we 
do," said Lt. Patrick Gildea, who is in charge of the city's community-oriented 
police program. "I got the idea for this while I was attending the FBI Academy. 
One of the programs there was about a successful program in a Southern 
community that helped citizens understand how police operate." 
</P>
<P>
 Gildea said that the first Huntington Beach Citizen Academy was formed after 
about 40 people volunteered to take the course. That group was narrowed to 25, 
plus alternates. Gildea said future classes will also be limited to about 25 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people we have in this first class are from all ages, including a couple 
of 18-year-olds and several seniors," he said. "They come from many 
occupations." 
</P>
<P>
 The participants will be taught by police officers, and the training will 
include lectures on laws of arrest and use of firearms. Gildea said the 
students also will go on tours, such as to the police firing range. 
</P>
<P>
 The next Citizen Academy will be held sometime in September, Gildea said, and 
Huntington Beach residents can volunteer by calling (714) 536-5932 and leaving 
their name and mailing address. He said he will mail applications to all who 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this is a good thing for community relations," Gildea said. He said 
both police and community members will learn more about each other through the 
new program. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; OFFICER AWARDED FOR MONEY-SAVING IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police Traffic Officer Craig Bryant is saving the city at least $2,100 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 And his award-winning idea is also making Huntington Beach a safer place, 
according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the kind of ingenuity we look for," said Jim Otterson, the city's 
traffic engineer. "Officer Craig Bryant is a very capable and very creative 
officer." 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant's idea was to use recuperating police officers to help Otterson's 
department conduct speed surveys on city streets. The surveys had always been 
done by civilian employees, and recession-caused city cutbacks have made it 
harder to keep up to date with the speed checks, Otterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cities have to do a traffic-and-engineering, radar-speed survey every five 
years if they want to use radar guns to enforce speed limits," Otterson said. 
"We've usually used a civilian employee or a contractor to go out and do the 
work. But for the last year, I've been short-staffed in my division." 
</P>
<P>
 Otterson said Bryant's suggestion to use police officers assigned to light 
duty to help with the speed surveys provides many benefits. "It helps with our 
(civilian) workload, and it also gives the officers who make the surveys a 
background in how and why the surveys are conducted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers recovering from injuries are placed on light duty, usually doing 
paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant, 43, a 20-year police veteran, said in an interview that he himself has 
sometimes been on light duty while recovering from injuries. He said he knows 
the frustration of being in the office, rather than out in the field. "Police 
officers want to be out there doing the job they were hired for," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant said that having up-to-date speed surveys allows police to use radar 
guns to check motorists' speed. A state law requires that speed surveys be 
conducted every five years on roads with speed limits of less than 55 m.p.h. 
The law is designed to prevent cities from setting up unfair "speed traps." 
</P>
<P>
 To conduct a speed survey, a person in an unmarked car uses a radar gun to 
mark the speed of 100 cars selected at random. A safe, average speed is then 
computed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of up-to-date speed surveys on some portions of Huntington Beach's 
section of Pacific Coast Highway embroiled city government in a high-profile 
federal lawsuit in 1990. A lawyer who formerly worked in Seal Beach charged 
that Huntington Beach police were consistently using radar illegally because of 
out-of-date speed surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer, Ernest J. Franceschi Jr., charged in his suit that the alleged 
misuse of radar amounted to "racketeering" by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Franceschi lost the suit in federal court, but the "racketeering" case caused 
the city embarrassing notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have said that because of Bryant's suggestion, Huntington Beach 
is now better able to keep up with timely speed surveys. Radar thus can be 
legally used and enforced, making streets safer, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city earlier this month awarded Bryant $210 for his suggestion. Bryant 
said he appreciates the award, but he said his biggest satisfaction is in 
helping radar enforcement in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to be hamstrung in using radar," he said. "It's a very valuable 
tool."BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; CITY EXPECTED TO OK REPAIRS TO STADIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council tonight is expected to approve spending $245,000 for design 
and other work to prepare for repairs to Anaheim Stadium, which sustained about 
$5 million in damage during the Northridge earthquake. Hellmuth, Obata and 
Kasabaum Inc. Sports Facility Group will perform architectural and engineering 
work, which will aid in the rebuilding of damaged portions of the stadium and 
in the installation of a new Sony Jumbotron scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 The stadium's 17.5-ton scoreboard and 23 tons of supporting structures fell 
during the Jan. 17 quake, knocking out 2,000 seats, two restrooms and a 
concession stand. The city will pay for the repair project with its stadium 
reserve fund account. Officials say the repairs should be completed by 
mid-August. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; FIRE CHIEF FIELDS QUESTIONS ON MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents asked the city's fire chief about 240 questions at a recent public 
forum on a proposal to merge the city Fire Department with the Orange County 
Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The county proposal offers the city two options, both of which would eliminate 
one of the city's four engine companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The first option would cost the city $4.7 million a year and would add a 
fourth firefighter to one of the remaining engine companies at fire station No. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 The second option would cost $4.4 million and keep the engine company at its 
current level of three firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 All 61 members of city Fire Department would keep their jobs and be absorbed 
into the county Fire Department if a contract is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision by the council is tentatively scheduled May 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park Fire Chief Herb R. Jewell responded to some of the top concerns 
expressed by residents at the April 4 meeting: 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There is concern about the eight-minute-or-less response time 80% of the 
time for paramedic units. Would there be any difference in paramedic response 
times? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. Both the city Fire Department and the county Fire Department have a 
desired service level of having a fire company arrive on the scene of any type 
of local emergency within a five-minute-or-less response time 80% of the time. 
This responding fire company will be the closest available unit, and not 
necessarily one that is paramedic-staffed. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city Fire Department, county Fire Department and the other 14 
city fire departments countywide operate under a standard -- established by the 
Orange County Emergency Medical Services Agency -- of having a 
paramedic-staffed fire company arrive on the scene of a local medical emergency 
within an eight-minute-or-less response time 80% of the time. In addition, 
since the county Fire Department would continue to operate two 
paramedic-staffed fire companies in Buena Park as the city Fire Department does 
today, the paramedic unit response times citywide by the county Fire Department 
would remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are there any impacts of eliminating one of the city's engine companies? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Under the regionally delivered fire services that the merger would provide, 
this action would not greatly affect local emergency response capability due to 
the number and location of the county's fire companies in the neighboring 
cities of Cypress, La Palma and Stanton. In fact, the county would provide one 
more engine company than the city does on most initial responses to residential 
structure fires and a substantially greater initial response to structure fires 
at major entertainment-corridor attractions along Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Would fire insurance rates increase for residents or business owners if a 
county contract is approved? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Buena Park barely made a Class 2 rating in 1985. The city will remain a 
Class 2 until the next analysis in early 1995. (The cities the county provides 
fire protection to are classified as a 3 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 as best 
and 10 as worst.) But since 1991, the city has reduced its Fire Department 
staffing by almost 24%, or by 19 positions. If the city Fire Department 
remains, the next time it is analyzed, it might drop to a classification of 3 
due to the reduction in staffing that has occurred. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; DRUMS AND DANCERS TELL AFRICA STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fransisca Atule Leff and her brother, Kofi Agana, rhythmically beat on drums 
while shaking and jumping to pulsating tunes Monday as part of a lesson on 
cultural awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 It was their first performance in Orange County. They danced for about 500 
students at Century High School in Santa Ana, kicking off school International 
Week activities in which a different culture is highlighted each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools throughout the county are holding similar celebrations in an effort to 
promote appreciation of different cultures, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leff and Agana are natives of the Gowrie village in Ghana, a nation in West 
Africa. They belong to the Fra Fra tribe and their dancing is a major part of 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The dancing duo and Leff's husband, Bob, make up Aba-Koma, a performing troupe 
based in San Luis Obispo that travels to schools, libraries and cultural events 
throughout the state in an effort to raise awareness about the Fra Fra and 
their customs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Leff told stories about tribal rituals and explained the dances as his 
wife and brother-in-law danced, sang and played several different drums. Each 
donned costumes native to Ghana. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't wear shoes when you do these dances because they are meant to honor 
the chief of the tribe," said Fransisca Leff, wearing a bobika, kava and sleet 
(headdress, blouse and skirt). "If you wear shoes, you're showing disrespect. 
And since we do authentic dances, there's no cheating." 
</P>
<P>
 Leff moved to the United States from Africa in 1982. Her brother has been a 
U.S. resident for one month. 
</P>
<P>
 With a circle of about 15 students around them, Leff and Agana taught the 
steps to the siyakadomowa dance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the dance we do when the chief comes home after fighting another 
tribe with his warriors," Leff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people -- especially the children -- in California need to know about 
this culture," she said. "That's why we're here -- to keep it alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Tan Vi Wilson, 14, said he appreciated the performance. "Even though my 
ancestors weren't from Africa, this made me feel proud." 
</P>
<P>
 Aba-Koma displayed wooden artwork, clothing, headdresses, musical instruments, 
a map of the country and the currency used in Ghana. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you think of Africa, you think of elephants and whatnot," said Matt 
Carr, 18. But the live presentation "gave us a chance to see something we 
probably would never get to see or learn about." 
</P>
<P>
 Century High Principal Tom Reasin said cultural events such as Aba-Koma's 
performance help students learn to respect people of different ethnicities both 
in school and in life. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Greek dancers will perform today, a Mexican banda group will play 
quebradita music Wednesday, Korean and Polynesian dancers will perform 
Thursday, and a country-Western band will conclude the week's festivities on 
Friday.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STANTON; MAN FOUND SHOT TO DEATH IN CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police are investigating the shooting death of a man found Sunday in the back 
seat of a car in the 7300 block of Syracuse Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very strange case at this point," said Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Dan 
Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have not been able to link the man, who has not yet been 
identified, to the 1985 Toyota in which he was found or to the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't appear that the shooting occurred at that location," Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The body was discovered when a neighbor called to report that the car had not 
been moved in two days.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; SADDLEBACK WINS 19 JOURNALISM AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saddleback College journalism students won 19 awards at a statewide 
competition in Fresno earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lariat student newspaper was judged third-best student publication in 
California among two-year schools by the Journalism Assn. of Community 
Colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the school received first-place awards for front-page layout, 
headline writing and opinion writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback College also did well in the on-the-spot competitions, winning 
several awards, including three first-place honors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the on-the-spot contests, journalism students are given a topic or event to 
cover and are given a deadline to finish the assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am extremely proud of our students' performances in the on-the-spot 
competitions," said Lariat adviser J. Mike Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel this aspect of the conference speaks well of the journalism principles 
we teach in our program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is also rewarding to see the students' hard work and dedication recognized 
with general-excellence awards." 
</P>
<P>
 On-the-spot first-place winners were Arash Gholam, who won awards for 
advertising design and info-graphics, and Sam Felsenfeld in the sportswriting 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-place and honorable-mention winners were Ben Delaney, Stacy Brown, Tina 
Visnic, Robin Schnug, Brian J. Cummings and Gholam. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Hoey won first place in opinion writing. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; CITY MAY REVISE RULES ON COMMERCIAL SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's 20-year-old sign ordinance -- aimed at avoiding clutter in the 
planned community's commercial zones -- might soon undergo significant 
modifications. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee made up of city officials, Chamber of Commerce members and local 
residents spent the past six months discussing ways of revising the ordinance, 
which merchants have long sought to liberalize. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is expected to consider a new ordinance at its May 10 
meeting. At that time, residents will be able to express their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 Surveys conducted by the city and Chamber of Commerce have found that the sign 
ordinance is a major concern to business people, said City Manager Paul O. 
Brady Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants have complained that the ordinance is too restrictive and does not 
allow them to use bright lights or other devices that would help their 
businesses stand out. As a result, shoppers can easily drive past a shopping 
center without being able to identify individual stores, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady said the goal is to be "business-friendly." 
</P>
<P>
 "After 20 years, it's time to take a look at this and see if we can make it 
different for the 1990s," he said. "We want to update it, but we want to keep 
the aesthetics intact and not have signs running rampant." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposed changes in the sign ordinance include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Allowing merchants to string white Christmas lights around their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Permitting the occasional use of searchlights on a temporary basis to 
advertise special events. 
</P>
<P>
 * Allowing the use of some neon lights and electronic animated lights, subject 
to review by the city. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; VOLUNTEERS NEEDED TO HELP PLANT TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group that has planted more than 250 trees this year with help from the city 
and a state grant will gather Saturday to plant flowering pear trees along 
Adams Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 John DeWitt, organizer of ReLeaf Costa Mesa, said dozens of volunteers came to 
tree plantings in February, March and earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Forestry gave a $4,500 grant to the nonprofit community 
group to help plant 4,000 trees along city parkways, DeWitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city maintains about 20,000 trees in parkways -- the areas between curb 
and sidewalk -- but does not have the money to replant the ones that have died, 
said David Alkema, the city's parks and parkways superintendent. Alkema 
estimated the city will spend $423,000 this year to maintain the parkway trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Many grants for tree planting are not available to government agencies, Alkema 
said. He said ReLeaf easily doubles the city's tree-planting power along 
parkways. 
</P>
<P>
 DeWitt said his group relies on volunteer labor, though the city helps by 
using power equipment to dig holes for the trees when the ground is too hard to 
break up with shovels. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has also helped supply tools and stakes, and even contacted the 
courts to obtain names of people who must perform community service to work off 
a sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real good relationship," Alkema said. "They are doing what we wouldn't 
be able to do for a long time because of our budgeting." 
</P>
<P>
 People who want to help plant trees this weekend should bring shovels and 
gloves and meet at 8 a.m. at Adams Avenue and Albatross Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call DeWitt at (714) 549-1175.WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; $50,000 MAY BE OKD FOR LAWSUIT DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council today will consider a request for $50,000 to pay for the cost 
of defending a lawsuit filed against several city officials by members of the 
Westminster Firefighters Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager Donald S. Anderson also is seeking council approval to 
hire the law office of Ferguson, Praet & Sherman to represent the defendants, 
which include Mayor Charles V. Smith and three council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, fire union officials filed the suit in U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles, stemming from the firing of union President Paul Gilbrook and the 
suspension of union director Mike Garrison. 
</P>
<P>
 The union lawsuit alleges that Gilbrook's firing and Garrison's suspension 
were in retaliation for a union-supported recall of Smith and council members 
Craig Schweisinger, Charmayne S. Bohman and Tony Lam. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, Schweisinger, Bohman and Lam will face voters on June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 In their suit, Gilbrook and Garrison said that they should have their jobs 
back and they should be compensated for lost wages and damages to their 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbrook was fired in February for allegedly driving a firetruck without a 
valid driver's license and cashing out sick leave improperly. He insists that 
he has done nothing wrong and wants court-ordered arbitration on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison was suspended in January for alleged "unprofessional" public comments 
about a fatal fire that was under investigation. He has since been issued a 
termination notice from Fire Chief John T. DeMonaco Jr., allegedly for improper 
use of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Smith, Schweisinger, Bohman and Lam, named in the lawsuit were 
City Manager Jerry Kenny, acting City Manager Robert J. Huntley and Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 The other defendants are DeMonaco, City Atty. Richard Jones, Finance Director 
Brian Mayhew and other unnamed city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing has not been set, officials said.BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; FALL KINDERGARTEN REGISTRATION TO BEGIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Registration for fall kindergarten classes in the Garden Grove Unified School 
District will begin Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A child must turn 5 on or before Dec. 2 to be eligible, without exception, 
said district spokesman Alan Trudell. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents must provide their local school with proof of their child's age, 
including a birth certificate, passport, baptism certificate, immigration visa 
or affidavit from the child's parent or guardian when no other documents are 
available, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 California law requires children to be immunized for polio, red measles, 
diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, German measles and mumps. Parents must 
provide written documentation of the immunizations from their physician or 
health care agency, Trudell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Immunizations are available from private medical doctors or at clinics 
maintained by the Orange County Health Care Agency. Parents should call (714) 
834-4722 for clinic locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Children should receive a checkup during their visit for immunizations. An 
examination given then will fulfill the legal requirements for a first-grade 
physical. The necessary forms are available at school offices, Trudell said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; ALL STUDENTS CAN PLAY A PART IN MUSICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since teacher Nancy Barnes started putting on a spring musical production at 
Urbain H. Plavan Elementary School four years ago, she has given every student 
an equal chance to shine on center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The casting call is open to any fourth- or fifth-grader desiring to perform -- 
whether in regular education or special education. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes, a speech and language therapist, said that for physically challenged 
students, being involved in a theater arts production has given them the 
encouragement "to do things they didn't think they were capable of doing." 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes them feel good about being part of a group," said Barnes, who has 
been teaching for 18 years. "I think they feel pretty proud. It's an 
accomplishment that they probably would have never even considered." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes added that the other students get the opportunity to work as a team 
with their physically challenged classmates and that the experience is positive 
and rewarding for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent rehearsal for Plavan Players' performance Thursday of "Jack & The 
Giant," cast members -- about 70, including stage crew -- exuded energy, 
excitement and pre-show jitters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me a little nervous," said Shaun Starnes, 10, who is physically 
challenged and has a part in the chorus as a villager. The fourth-grade student 
said he auditioned because it makes him happy to be on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me feel good about myself," said Shaun, who uses a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 Classmate Chris Richards, 10, who is also in a wheelchair and has a solo 
singing part, said that the only thing he worries about is "messing up." 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me nervous because of all the people who will be watching," Chris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes said the theater program, an after-school activity, is a valuable 
experience for all students. She said it helps in many areas, including 
communication and memory skills, interpersonal relationships, cooperation, 
creativity, expression and self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 It costs about $500 to put on the musical -- not including a small stipend 
paid to Barnes for her time -- and is paid by the school's parent and teacher 
organization and from a state school improvement program. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the number of students participating has doubled since the first 
production in spring, 1991, Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: "Kids see how fun it is," said Bryan Caforio, 11, who plays a 
troll. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barnes said readying for the 90-minute production, which has parent and 
teacher support, is demanding on students. Rehearsals are three times a week 
for 10 weeks. Students with lead parts practice up to 4 1/2 hours a week.

<P>
 "It's a big commitment," Barnes said because the young actors must take 
responsibility to learn their lines, dance steps and songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth-grade student Michael Hanna, a regular education student who has a lead 
role playing "Jack," agreed that it is difficult to learn lines and words to 
the songs. 
</P>
<P>
 "But once I remember them, I'm not frustrated, and you feel better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Catherine Anderson, 11, who plays "Miss Priss" the cow, also said being in the 
musical is a lot of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's worth it in the end," said the fifth-grade student. "When it all 
comes together, it's a good feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 The performance is at 7 p.m. at the school, 9675 Warner Ave. There is no 
admission charge, but donations will be accepted to offset production costs.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; RESTAURANT ON PIER DAMAGED IN BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fisherman's Galley Restaurant at the end of the pier sustained partial 
damage Monday after one of its walls and part of the ceiling caught fire, fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators suspect the fire, which began about 2 p.m., was caused by a 
short-circuit in the outside neon lighting system. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant employees said an angler alerted them that one of the outside walls 
was smoldering. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15 customers were inside, bartender Walter Washburn said. Some of the 
employees used fire extinguishers before firefighters arrived, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant manager Darren Yanosy said that when he arrived between 8 and 9 
a.m., something was wrong with the lights. The neon, he said, wasn't on. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a similar fire occurred six months ago when an angler casting his line 
overhead broke the neon sign and short-circuited the lighting system. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department Battalion Chief Don Jones said that because firefighters can't 
take trucks onto the pier, the department sent a firefighting boat to the scene 
to help the other three engine companies quell the relatively small blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 He estimated the damage at about $2,500. No one was injured. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; TASK FORCE TO LOBBY SCOUTS FOR GAY RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents can apply to join a task force being formed to lobby the Boy Scouts 
of America to change its policy of banning gays from joining the Police 
Explorer program. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council proposed the task force because it is concerned that Laguna 
Beach, which bans discrimination against gays, also has the Boy Scout-sponsored 
Police Explorer program. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has already advised the Boy Scouts that it will not discriminate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Boy Scout officials have said that the city has agreed to follow the 
group's rules by having the explorer program. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to trying to change the policy of the Boy Scouts, task force 
members will consider alternative programs similar to the Police Explorers. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to eventually have in place a program open to all residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force will report back to the City Council in six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is seeking task force members who represent parents, youth, gay 
rights groups and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 To be considered, residents must fill out an application -- available at the 
city clerk's office -- and identify which group they represent. 
</P>
<P>
 Completed applications must be returned to the city clerk's office by 5 p.m. 
May 12. 
</P>
<P>
 All applicants will be interviewed by the City Council at its 6 p.m. meeting 
on May 17.LESLIE EARNEST

SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL DROP EVICTION SUIT AGAINST RAMS; DISPUTE: BOARD OKS 
PRACTICE FIELD LEASE RATIFIED EARLIER BY TEAM, ANAHEIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The school district that owns the Los Angeles Rams' practice site decided 
Monday to drop eviction proceedings against the team, because the Rams have 
agreed to extend their lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia School District board members met Monday night and officially 
approved the lease. The City Council ratified it last week, as did the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased to have this matter behind us," said Supt. Paul S. Mercier. 
"It's unfortunate that it took this amount of time to bring it to closure. I'm 
pleased that I can go back and focus on educational matters." 
</P>
<P>
 The team's previous lease expired on Dec. 31. Under it and the new agreement, 
the city leases the former school site from the school district and sublets it 
to the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 The district filed suit earlier this month because the Rams had refused to 
sign a lease agreement extending their tenure at the park, nor had they moved 
out, Mercier said.  
</P>
<P>
 The months-long lease squabble may foreshadow problems for Anaheim officials 
in their efforts to keep the Rams in the city. Team officials have said they 
will exercise an escape clause in their stadium lease May 3, then investigate 
moving the franchise to a location that would be more profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 With the lease issue settled, city officials said Monday that they hope to 
address ways to prevent the Rams from leaving Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bob D. Simpson said the district's action "means what has been a 
major stumbling block has finally been put aside. Now we can focus on the 
bigger issue on keeping the team here, if indeed that is possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Rams officials could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the 10-year lease that was approved by the city and Rams last Tuesday 
and accepted by the district Monday, the Rams have a five-year extension 
option. Also, the team can break the lease at any time provided it gives at 
least six months' notice, pays about $250,000 and restores the facility to its 
original condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual rent is $250,000 this year and goes up by $12,500 in each of the 
next four years, then is adjusted according to the Consumer Price Index.  
</P>
<P>
 The city has agreed to subsidize all the Rams' rental payments over $120,000, 
which would be about $3.3 million over 15 years. The city has also agreed to 
cover about half of restoration costs of $1.2 million to $1.5 million.

27 ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF SOLICITING PROSTITUTION; LAW ENFORCEMENT: POLICE 
ALSO CITE TWO BARS AND TWO LIQUOR STORES FOR ALLEGEDLY SELLING LIQUOR TO AN 
18-YEAR-OLD DECOY.

<P>
 Police arrested 27 people on suspicion of soliciting prostitution during a 
sweep of areas along Beach Boulevard and West Lincoln Avenue, officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Anaheim police and the county's Alcoholic Beverage Control 
renewed their Decoy Program aimed at bars and liquor stores suspected of 
selling liquor to minors, vice Sgt. Michael Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using an 18-year-old man who went around the same Beach Boulevard and West 
Lincoln Avenue areas, officers cited two liquor stores and two bars that 
allegedly sold him alcohol, Patterson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Both operations, which were carried out Friday night and early Saturday, "were 
very successful," Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Decoy Program was discontinued in 1993 after a Court of Appeal in San 
Francisco ruled that the use of teen-agers by police to catch businesses 
selling to minors was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 But three weeks ago, the California Supreme Court held that police could use 
teen-age decoys 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson said the four businesses face fines or suspensions or both, 
depending on their prior records. 
</P>
<P>
 The prostitution arrests involved 20 men suspected of soliciting prostitutes 
and seven women suspected of prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Four more people were arrested during the sweep, two of whom are suspected of 
conducting narcotics sales and two others in connection with lewd conduct in 
public, police said.

TICKETS ISSUED FOR SMALL OIL SPILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Coast Guard is testing a program of handing out tickets when small oil 
spills occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil spills require a full-scale investigation by the Coast Guard, a procedure 
that can drag on before ending in hearings before an administrative officer. 
Hoping to speed up the process, the agency is launching a six-month test of 
issuing tickets in spills of 100 gallons or less in the port areas of Long 
Beach, Charleston, S.C., and Galveston, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 When a spill occurs and the violator is known, the investigating officer can 
issue a ticket immediately under the program. The violator will be able to pay 
a penalty to close the case within 30 days or request a hearing.

ORANGE CITY COUNCIL MAY TELEVISE MEETINGS; GOVERNMENT: TRIAL RUN MAY BE 
UNDERTAKEN AT NO COST TO THE CITY IF A CABLE REPORT DUE IN MAY IS APPROVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council last week moved a step closer to televising its meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Council meetings may be televised on a public access channel this summer, if 
the council approves a proposal contained in a final cable television report 
due by the end of May.If approved, officials said, a trial program would last 
one or two months, at no cost to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a preliminary city report, first-year costs of permanent cable 
coverage would include $163,400 for robotic cameras and a City Hall control 
room, and $19,200 for a camera operator. Recurring annual costs for the control 
room and robotic cameras would be $38,400, while camera operator expenses would 
stay the same, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not everyone can attend afternoon meetings," said Councilman Mark Murphy. 
"I'm encouraged by the possibilities here and feel like this is something the 
citizens of Orange have a right to have." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Pro Tempore Fred L. Barrera said he would oppose the introduction of 
cameras into council chambers if it cost the city money. 
</P>
<P>
 "This city can't afford it right now," Barrera said. "It would be nice to have 
it, but I can't support it." 
</P>
<P>
 Most cities in Orange County are required to broadcast council meetings at no 
cost to the city as part of cable franchise agreements. The city's contract 
with Cablevision of Orange, which is due for renegotiation Nov. 1, has no such 
requirement.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: MICROPOLIS REPORTS $9.76-MILLION LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Micropolis Corp., a Chatsworth disk-drive manufacturer, reported a $9.76 
million first-quarter loss, while its revenue declined 12% to $83.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said its performance suffered in the quarter ended April 1 because 
of higher sales of a less profitable disk drive, and continued investment in 
new products that have yet to generate sales. It also suffered $1 million in 
earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the year-earlier quarter, Micropolis earned $1.46 million on $94.6 million 
in revenue.

TOUGH SELL FOR CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE; HARD HIT BY RECESSION AND QUAKE, BOOSTER 
GROUPS SEEK NEW WAYS TO STAY IN BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chambers of commerce: Their very name calls to mind permanence and bedrock 
conservatism. But with membership on the wane due to recession and the 
Northridge earthquake, many chambers in the San Fernando Valley are being 
forced to find new ways to stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
 While some chambers are laying off staff to cut costs, others are casting 
aside a tradition of do-goodism in favor of a more hard-bitten, pragmatic 
approach -- from taking part in neighborhood crime watch programs to teaching 
members about workers' compensation laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple times last year we came very, very close to closing our doors," said 
Aline Hausman, executive director of the Canoga Park/West Hills Chamber of 
Commerce. Her membership has dropped to 280 from about 325 in 1990, while 
annual revenues -- three-fourths of it from membership dues -- dropped to 
$55,000 last year from $75,000 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In tight times, many small businesses can't afford a couple of hundred dollars 
per year for chamber memberships, said Hausman, who has worked for the chamber 
seven years. Hausman is the chamber's only full-time employee. Her part-time 
assistant has been cut back to as few as eight hours per week from 20, and the 
chamber's monthly newsletter has shrunk from 12 pages to four. 
</P>
<P>
 While a few of the largest of the Valley's two dozen chambers are growing, 
most smaller chambers report shrinking rosters, a trend that is reflected in 
chamber membership nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Hausman said the Canoga Park/West Hills chamber could lose an additional 
quarter of its members this year because so many small firms were severely 
damaged by the earthquake. To raise money, Hausman said, the chamber has 
started gift fairs and other fund-raisers in addition to the chili cook-offs it 
has always held. 
</P>
<P>
 These cuts have occurred despite a recent merger that united the 40-member 
West Hills chamber and the 240-member Canoga Park chamber. The merger was 
approved because West Hills' had exhausted its ability to stay afloat with 
volunteer labor, and Canoga Park needed to bolster its membership to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Other chambers report similar troubles: The month after the quake, the Granada 
Hills Chamber of Commerce collected not a single payment from members whose 
fees were due, said office administrator Maria Casal. Even before the quake, 
Granada Hills' chamber membership was down to 280 from about 450 three years 
ago. A full-time position has been cut from the staff, and now only Casal's 
part-time post remains. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson is clear. These days, chambers can no longer count on people 
joining just because it's "the American thing to do," said Jan Sobel, executive 
director of the Encino Chamber of Commerce, one of the few Valley chambers that 
is growing, having gained 75 members in the past 12 months for a total of 640. 
</P>
<P>
 The Encino chamber has been successful because it concentrates on helping 
members cope with financial problems -- offering services like worker's 
compensation clinics, and help with zoning and other regulatory issues, Sobel 
said. "Back in the '70s, being in a chamber was giving back to your community, 
pancake breakfasts, education committees, parades. . . . We don't do that 
anymore," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard times have prompted some chambers to take radical measures. The Tarzana 
Chamber of Commerce, where membership in the past three years has shrunk by 
nearly one-quarter to 350, now participates in a year-old crime-watch program 
coordinated by local police in which its members prowl Ventura Boulevard 
rooftops at night to spy for drug dealers. Encino chamber members also take 
part. Tarzana chamber President Sandy Miller said she promotes the crime watch 
to potential new members, who want to know how the chamber can help with their 
graffiti and crime problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In Reseda, recruiting new Chamber of Commerce members has meant reaching out 
in new ways. The chamber has started printing its newsletter in four languages: 
Korean, Vietnamese, Spanish and English. Chamber President Tom Hilborn said the 
chamber has had trouble recruiting immigrant-owned businesses and hopes the new 
newsletter will "let them know we will go the extra mile for them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Membership in the Reseda chamber, now 200, is slightly down from 1990. Annual 
revenues last year were $45,000, down slightly from an average of $50,000 or so 
in the late 1980s, said chamber Executive Director Ann Kinzle, the agency's 
only employee. Kinzle has raised four children in Reseda and was a volunteer 
for the first 10 of the 20 years she has worked for the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reseda chamber has always gotten by on dues, donations and the sweat of 
volunteers. But since the earthquake, dues collections have become "small to 
nothing," said Hilborn. The chamber is planning its first "casino night," a 
faux-gambling event with prizes, to help make up money lost from the 
earthquake, he said. The Tarzana chamber has also recently established a casino 
night to raise funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Just what chambers do now depends on whom you talk to. Their role evolved 
considerably from the early part of the century, when chambers -- voluntary, 
nonprofit associations supported by members' dues -- collaborated closely with 
the federal government.  
</P>
<P>
 During World War I, chambers of commerce curbed business competition by 
parceling out government contracts. Later, Herbert Hoover, as secretary of 
commerce, used them to implement federal programs aimed at curbing waste and 
stabilizing the economy, said Ellis Hawley, an Iowa professor of business 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Those origins have been long forgotten by most chamber loyalists today, who 
are more familiar with chambers' anti-government and anti-regulation stance. 
Small, local chambers are better known for community boosterism and an endless 
stream of identical business breakfasts, luncheons and mixers that keep area 
banquet halls in frequent use. 
</P>
<P>
 But many are now finding that is not enough. Although most chamber officials 
say they still get new members, keeping them is difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world has changed. Most business owners don't have time for social 
events. They have to keep their nose to the grindstone," said Hilborn, the 
Reseda chamber president. Hilborn, who is not paid for his chamber work, owns 
an automotive restoration shop on Reseda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Business owners who join chambers want to know it will help them make new 
contacts and increase sales, said Hilborn. Fewer now see chamber social 
functions as valuable for their own sake. And even as social organizations, 
chambers fight a reputation for being rather stuffy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you ever been to a chamber mixer? They are hell," said Neil Eisenberg, 
president of KidsLimo in Tarzana. Eisenberg nonetheless recently joined the 
Tarzana chamber and has begun attending the mixers. His forbearance has paid 
off with a handful of new jobs. But the 40-year-old Eisenberg found the crowd a 
bit too old. 
</P>
<P>
 "I joined primarily to promote my business. In fact, it's only to promote my 
business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "An old boys' clique club," is how Rich Peter, president of Richard C. Peter & 
Co. of Northridge, described the Northridge Chamber of Commerce, to which he 
belonged for one year. Peter said he quit because he didn't make any contacts 
that helped his business. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted with this hardheadedness, more successful chambers have become 
aggressive marketers, educators and political advocates for members. The 
Chatsworth Chamber of Commerce, with about 400 members, added about 10 new 
members a month last year. Part of its draw was a plastic discount "gold card" 
honored by 250 local businesses that belong to the chamber. The cards were 
created as a marketing gimmick to encourage those employed in Chatsworth to 
shop and eat at nearby businesses, said former chamber President Gary Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 And increasingly, chamber officials are quick to distance themselves from 
social clubs and charities in hope of revamping their image. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills Chamber of Commerce has 945 members, up from 744 a year 
ago. Chamber executive Evia Phillips said the chamber offers various 
educational workshops and advocacy services in response to members' requests. 
"This is not like a party," Phillips shot back when asked about the chamber's 
growth. "We are strictly business."

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: RATING OF 20TH CENTURY SUBSIDIARIES AGAIN CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 20th Century Industries' two insurance subsidiaries had their claims-paying 
ability ratings cut for the second time in a week Friday as a result of the 
Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Standard & Poor's Corp. said it lowered the claims-paying ratings for 20th 
Century Insurance and 21st Century Casualty to BBB+ from A. Three days earlier, 
the rating agency lowered the units' ratings from AA. 
</P>
<P>
 The second ratings reductions came after Woodland Hills-based 20th Century 
Industries said it lost $256 million in the first quarter because of expected 
earthquake claims totaling $475 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest ratings mean that the 20th Century Industries insurance units are 
considered to have adequate financial security, but are susceptible to adverse 
economic and underwriting conditions. Standard & Poor's also said 20th Century 
Industries and its subsidiaries are being watched for possible further ratings 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The credit-assessment rating of 20th Century Industries was also downgraded by 
Standard & Poor's on Friday, to BB+ from A+ before the first rate reduction.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: HAMBURGER HAMLET LOSES $327,000 IN 1ST QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hamburger Hamlet Restaurants Inc. reported a loss of $327,000 in its first 
quarter compared with a profit a year earlier, while revenues remained flat. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant chain, based in Sherman Oaks, said its revenues were $17.44 
million for the quarter that ended March 26, up slightly from revenues of 
$17.38 million a year earlier.A year ago, the company posted a first-quarter 
profit of $466,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The company attributed the poor showing to the continued weak economy in 
Southern California and the loss of some business at restaurants damaged by the 
Northridge earthquake. Hamburger Hamlet operates 35 restaurants, 22 of them in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterly loss included a provision of $355,000 to cover severance 
payments to Thomas A. McFall, the company's former chief executive, who 
resigned recently after disagreements with some shareholders over the company's 
direction.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: NEW IMAGE INDUSTRIES' INCOME TAKES PLUNGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New Image Industries Inc., a Canoga Park maker of intra-oral cameras and 
related dental imaging devices, reported a loss for the three months that ended 
March 31 as its revenue declined sharply due to bad winter weather and the Jan. 
17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 New Image's fiscal third-quarter loss was $840,000, while its revenue fell 
25%, to $6.74 million.A year earlier, the company earned $1.93 million on $9.02 
million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said its third-quarter results were also hurt by $650,000 in legal 
expenses over a patent dispute, a $300,000 reserve for older inventory and 
$350,000 for sales commissions from the previous six months under its new 
marketing programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the year-earlier quarter figures include results from New Image's former 
subsidiary, Styles on Video, which was spun off to shareholders in March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 For the nine months, New Image's net income plunged 70%, to $1.26 million from 
earnings of $4.16 million in the same period a year before. Its nine-month 
revenue edged up to $23.1 million from $22.5 million.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: STYLES ON VIDEO SHOWS $1.4-MILLION QUARTER PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Styles on Video Inc., a Canoga Park developer and marketer of hair-imaging 
systems, reported a first-quarter profit of $1.41 million on revenue of $3.29 
million, citing growth in its international business plus new products. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it also did not have to pay income taxes in the first quarter 
because of certain options that it exercised. Styles on Video, whose products 
allow consumers to preview changes in hairstyle by computer, became an 
independent public company in March, 1993, and as a result had no comparable 
figures for the same quarter a year earlier.

LANDLORDS UNDER THE GUN; IF BUILDING OWNERS CAN'T MAKE REPAIRS BY MID-JULY, 
DISPLACED TENANTS CAN WALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As owners of some two dozen quake-damaged, large office buildings in the San 
Fernando Valley struggle to make repairs and reopen, many of them are racing 
against a deadline: July 17. 
</P>
<P>
 More than just the six-month anniversary of the Northridge earthquake, it 
marks the day when many tenants of these buildings can exercise an escape 
clause and walk away from their five- and 10-year leases. In some leases, 
landlords have even fewer than six months to fix their properties before 
tenants can break rental agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 Some owners are unlikely to meet this deadline because of delays in securing 
federal Small Business Administration loans, insurance payments, and 
construction permits and crews. But not all displaced tenants are sympathetic. 
Complaining about working out of boxes in their homes or tight temporary 
offices, some tenants say they won't wait more than they're required to before 
moving permanently elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a waiting game to see which (building) owner comes back and when," said 
Cathy Scullin, a broker at Zugsmith-Thind, a commercial real estate firm in 
Encino. And if they do, she asked, "Do they come back intact, or crippled 
because they lost their tenants?" 
</P>
<P>
 Neal Tenen is one of seven lawyers who shared offices at the Sherman Oaks 
Atrium at Magnolia and Sepulveda boulevards, before the earthquake forced them 
to scatter and set up makeshift offices, mostly in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenen says he has been a tenant at the Atrium for seven years. "It's a 
super-nice building," he said of the four-story building with hundreds of 
windows, many of which were shattered by the quake, and an atrium that is now 
obstructed by construction scaffolds. But if the 96,000-square-foot building 
isn't repaired by mid-July, as required under his lease, Tenen says he may not 
come back. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenen and other lawyers are talking about buying a small office building of 
their own. "It's going to be a close call" whether the owner meets the 
deadline, he said. "There could be a mad rush to finish." 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of Sherman Oaks Atrium, Advent Realty Limited Partnership, declined 
to comment. But the Atrium's leasing agent, John Sabourin of Beitler Commercial 
Realty Services, says the owner had earthquake insurance. The Los Angeles 
Department of Building and Safety estimated the Atrium's structural damage at 
$500,000. Sabourin says the building was 80% occupied before the quake and will 
reopen in mid-June, meaning that tenants will have to return under their leases 
or face a possible lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the 6.8-magnitude quake, tenants gave little thought to the fine print 
in leases called the "damage and destruction" clause. But the clause is 
boilerplate, and it typically gives landlords three to six months to restore 
their properties after a disaster, said Bill Inglis, a broker with CB 
Commercial Real Estate Group in Sherman Oaks. Attorneys say tenants signing new 
leases now want shorter time limits for landlords to make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners are keenly aware of these deadlines, but their efforts to beat 
them are running up against delays caused by heavy demand for construction work 
and governmental services. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Berman is waiting for an SBA loan to rebuild the Scotty Building on 
Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks. The Scotty Building is actually two 
structures, totaling 74,000 square feet, that connected with each other. But 
one of them, a two-story structure, was burned to a crisp by a fire caused by 
the Northridge quake; the other, a five-story building, reopened a month ago 
after crews cleaned up the smoke damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman says his insurance policy covered the $3 million in damage, and his 
plans are to build a new two-story structure. But he says that building won't 
be finished for another year. Still, Berman says he isn't worried about 
reopening without tenants because he expects plenty of tenants dislocated from 
the quake to be in need of good office space; plus he claims that many of his 
tenants will return, even after a yearlong wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Brokers agree that office space in the Valley is tightening: The office 
vacancy rate dropped to less than 10% in the first quarter, from nearly 14% in 
the previous quarter. One big reason: 25 major office buildings in the Valley 
were severely damaged by the quake, according to a survey by Zugsmith-Thind. 
The survey didn't count office buildings smaller than 20,000 square feet or 
some company-owned offices such as the Hamburger Hamlet building in Sherman 
Oaks -- part of which was ripped apart by the quake and remains empty. The 
survey also didn't include the scores of retail shops that were ravaged by the 
temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other big office buildings had minor quake damage and were only closed 
for a few days. At the 12-story Republic Bank Building on Ventura Boulevard in 
Encino, for example, huge pieces of stucco cracked from its facade, making the 
damage look much worse than it really is. The damage was estimated at $100,000, 
and the building reopened two days after the quake, although cosmetic repairs 
are still going on. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Sherman Oaks, 12 major office buildings were severely damaged, representing 
a total of 950,000 square feet -- or more than a third of the entire office 
space in Sherman Oaks. One of these buildings has been razed, but the rest are 
expected to be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 One high-rise that beat the six-month deadline was the Tower, a 13-story 
building on Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks. But it took more than $1 million 
in insurance money and 200 construction workers laboring around the clock to 
get the building reopened in late March. 
</P>
<P>
 The 160,500-square-foot Tower is one of seven office buildings in the Valley 
owned by pension funds that are managed by TCW Realty Advisors in Los Angeles. 
On Jan. 17, the Tower was trashed: Water pipes burst, doors jammed, partitions 
collapsed and many deep cracks ran along the building's shear walls like lines 
on the palm of a hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had 15 file cabinets at 1,500 pounds apiece that bounced 20 feet like a 
sack of potatoes," said Bruce Frasco, general manager at Beitler Commercial 
Real Estate Services, one of the Tower's major tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Leuty, who manages the Tower building for TCW, said it cost several 
million dollars to complete the repairs. TCW manages dozens of buildings 
nationwide, and that gave it an edge in hustling up contractors, she said. 
Seismic engineers were at the Tower a few hours after the quake, and TCW had 
quick access to specialists who applied epoxy, a super glue used to fill cracks 
in concrete walls, which has been in heavy demand lately. 
</P>
<P>
 Leuty said the Tower had to hurry because offices were leased at $1.75 to 
$1.90 per square foot, so the building was losing about $275,000 a month in 
rent. The Tower was 95% occupied before the quake, but it isn't clear how many 
tenants will return. Leuty said tenants are coming back slowly, but some 
businesses that were struggling before the quake will probably never return. "I 
don't think we really know for sure," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tower tenants like Beitler, which had squeezed workers in cramped offices in 
Encino for two months, say they are glad to be back at the Tower. So are nearby 
retailers, who have lost customers who worked in the Tower building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very, very hurt," said Pam Chinvaraj, a longtime waitress at the Aajak 
Thai restaurant, which counted on workers at the Tower a few steps away for 
much of its lunch business. "We're really happy they're coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 But many businesses that were tenants of quake-damaged buildings remain in 
limbo. "We're still working out of boxes," lamented Irv Kornblum, whose 
accounting firm has moved twice since the AIC Plaza in Sherman Oaks was hit by 
the quake. "We lost two weeks time just unloading and loading boxes," he said. 
And this during the busy tax-preparing season. 
</P>
<P>
 Kornblum says his firm has 2 1/2 years left on a five-year lease at the AIC 
Plaza and one month left on a three-month lease for his current office in North 
Hollywood. "I'm not really sure where we'll end up," he said, adding with a 
tinge of resentment that the six-month clause in his lease is a "stingy point" 
and too long. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Parker, whose American Insurance Consultants Inc. owns the AIC Plaza, says 
his 80,000-square-foot building will be ready by June 1. Parker said he has no 
debt on the building, but would not say how much damage his building sustained 
or whether he had earthquake insurance. City Building and Safety Department 
officials put the repair estimate at AIC Plaza at about $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody will be coming back," Parker said, adding tersely that it was 
costing him a "small fortune" to make repairs and that the rebuilding process 
has been like a long visit to the dentist's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Some quake-damaged buildings appear unlikely to reopen by mid-July, including 
two side-by-side properties at Van Nuys and Chandler boulevards known as 
Sherman Oaks Center I and II. Tenants say one of the owners of the pair of 
buildings, Irving Ackert, has said the offices will be repaired, but they said 
it was unclear when. 
</P>
<P>
 Ackert didn't return telephone calls. But there were no signs of construction 
work last week. Inside the building's dark hallway, a dozen browning newspapers 
dated Jan. 18, the day after the quake, were still strewn on the floor. And 
posted on the doors of the two buildings were red inspection cards from the 
city's building inspectors, meaning that both buildings are unsafe to enter, 
along with several signs taped by former tenants with their new addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the signs belonged to the Democratic Party Office of the San Fernando 
Valley, which set up in a storefront on the second floor of a Van Nuys strip 
mall. Alan Zimmerman, the office manager, wants to move back to Sherman Oaks 
Center, where he had twice as much space. "For now, we're OK," he said. "But 
I'm getting nervous because of the campaigns coming up. We'll need a lot more 
space." 
</P>
<P>
 Patience has worn out for another tenant in the Sherman Oaks Center building, 
Mark Stevens Construction. Manager Christina Tomczak said the company, now 
working out of a cramped guest house, is searching for a permanent location. 
"We can't wait around not knowing," she said.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: HOME SALES UP 60%, JOBLESS RATE POINTS TO BETTER ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residential housing sales in Ventura County soared to what one analyst called 
"spectacular" levels last month, increasing nearly 60% over the year-ago level. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 986 new and previously owned homes closed escrow in March, giving 
the county its eighth consecutive monthly increase, reports Dataquick 
Information Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The total, which includes single-family homes and condominiums, is 60% above 
the figure for March, 1993, and amounts to the largest year-to-year gain for 
any Southern California county since May, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's truly a spectacular performance," Dataquick analyst John Karevoll said. 
He attributes the strong showing to two recent developments -- the apparent 
bottoming-out of interest rates and a brightening economic outlook. "People 
figure it's now or never if they're going to get low mortgage rates. And the 
economy seems to be inching its way upward, giving buyers the confidence to 
make a move." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the improved market, housing prices in the county remain soft. The 
median sales price in March was $202,000 -- 8% less than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reporting service, TRW REDI Property Data, said Ventura County home 
sales in the first quarter were up, but not nearly as dramatically as in March 
alone. A total of 1,907 new and previously owned homes closed escrow in the 
first three months of the year, 18% more than a year earlier, TRW REDI 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporting Karevoll's remarks about a strengthening economy, the jobless rate 
in the county fell to 8% in March from 9% in February. More than 5,000 new jobs 
were created during March, according to the state Employment Development 
Department.

<P>
 Armon Networking Ltd., a Tel Aviv-based producer of systems for monitoring 
computer networks, has established its U. S. headquarters in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Why Camarillo? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because that's where I happen to live," said Timothy Riley, the Israeli 
firm's vice president for sales and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 Armon, founded in 1992, markets systems that help maintain the efficiency of 
networks linking companies' computers. The firm is partly owned by another Tel 
Aviv concern, RAD Group. "We're selling our products in a dozen countries," 
Riley said. "We're in a very hot field. Business is great."

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: LAUTERBACH OPENS BRANCH IN VAN NUYS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There have been numerous reports of companies moving to Ventura County from 
earthquake-damaged facilities in the San Fernando Valley. But Oxnard-based 
Lauterbach & Associates is reversing the trend, at least partially. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauterbach, an architectural and planning concern, is maintaining its 
headquarters in Oxnard, but has opened a branch office in Van Nuys. The firm's 
president and chief executive, John A. Parezo, is splitting his time between 
the two locations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley unit is getting a good deal of business from clients who suffered 
earthquake damage, but Lauterbach didn't make the move because of the quake, 
reports John Grounds, the firm's computer systems manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, we've been planning to expand into Los Angeles County for three or 
four years," he said. "We're working on several major projects in the Valley. A 
great many earthquake rehabilitation projects have come in, too, but none of 
them are very large."

STATE PRISON, PLAGUED BY ESCAPES, WILL INSTALL ELECTRIFIED FENCE; CORRECTIONS: 
LETHAL BARRIER IS EXPECTED TO SAVE MONEY BY REPLACING WATCHTOWER GUARDS AS WELL 
AS IMPROVE SECURITY AT THE FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Workers on Wednesday will begin surrounding the state prison in Lancaster with 
a lethal electrified fence that should make escapes less likely at an 
institution that had four during its first year of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Interim Warden John M. Ratelle said Monday that the electrified fence will 
allow the prison to save money by removing armed officers from 10 watchtowers. 
At the same time, he said, it will discourage inmates from trying to escape by 
climbing the perimeter fences, as convicted murderer Eric Rene Johnson did in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 Tower officers apparently did not see Johnson scale the two 12-foot chain-link 
fences surrounding the prison. When an electrified barrier is activated between 
these fences, the tower officers will no longer be needed, the warden said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have human beings in the gun towers," Ratelle said. "What the fence does 
is take out the human-error part. The fence never goes to sleep. It doesn't go 
to the bathroom. It doesn't do any of those things. It's always working." 
</P>
<P>
 In an hourlong interview, his first since assuming control six weeks ago when 
Warden Otis Thurman was removed by the state, Ratelle added that within a 
month, punishment will be handed down against officers whose actions are 
believed to have contributed to separate escapes by Johnson and another 
maximum-security inmate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investigations (are) completed, and there will be some disciplinary 
actions taken," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the widespread concerns over these escapes, Ratelle urged the 
community to see the prison in a more positive light. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed to the public clean-up work done by minimum-security prison crews 
and the charity work done by prison staff members who have helped combat child 
abuse and provided meals to the needy. 
</P>
<P>
 The warden added that the prison, with its annual budget of $78 million and 
nearly 1,000 employees, is making a significant economic contribution to the 
Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "That money goes back into the local community," Ratelle said. "I think 
sometimes that gets lost because of a couple of setbacks the institution had." 
</P>
<P>
 California State Prison-Los Angeles County, which was built despite objections 
from the community, opened in February, 1993. During its first year, two 
minimum-security inmates walked away from a barracks outside the prison fences, 
maximum-security inmate Johnson scaled the fences to escape, and another, 
Steven Charles Brigida, got out by hiding in a garbage truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Although all four prisoners were recaptured, the incidents angered and alarmed 
residents. In late February of this year, state corrections officials told the 
first warden, Thurman, to retire or accept another post elsewhere. Ratelle said 
he had not been told whether Thurman has made a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratelle, 53, warden at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility near San 
Diego, was asked to take the helm at Lancaster for three or four months until 
the governor appoints a new permanent warden. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his arrival at Lancaster, which houses almost 4,000 inmates, Ratelle 
said he has made sure inmates are counted eight times a day. He also has 
ordered stricter supervision of "close custody" inmates, who are serving long 
sentences and are considered more likely to try to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Lax supervision was one reason for the two maximum-security escapes, Ratelle 
said. "People sometimes tend to become complacent," he said. "If it was 
anything, it was just a little complacency." 
</P>
<P>
 But since his arrival, the warden added, "the staff at the institution has 
responded marvelously. They really have rallied around all of these procedural 
changes." 
</P>
<P>
 The new electrified fence is expected to be a further deterrent to escapes 
over the chain-link fences that surround the buildings where medium- and 
maximum-security inmates are confined. 
</P>
<P>
 The electrified fence, which should be finished by December, will carry a 
charge of 650 milliamperes. For the average person, 70 milliamperes is enough 
to cause immediate death, said Bill Gengler, a spokesman for the California 
Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 The first such fence was activated late last year at Calipatria State Prison 
in Imperial County. No inmate has ignored the warning signs and tried to escape 
over the fence since it was turned on, prison officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster is one of 15 other California prisons slated to get an electrified 
fence over the next year. The fence, expected to cost up to $1 million, will 
save money because staffing a gun tower around the clock costs $225,000 
annually, prison officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 By removing officers from 10 of Lancaster's 12 towers, the institution will 
save more than $2 million annually, Ratelle said. These tower officers will be 
reassigned to vacant jobs at the prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Inmate-rights groups have criticized the so-called "death fences" as a cruel 
form of punishment. But Ratelle responded: "You're not going to touch the fence 
accidentally. You have to have a clear (intent) to get over the fence. If you 
die because of that, you made a choice." 
</P>
<P>
 The warden hopes the electric fence and other security improvements will 
restore the community's confidence in the prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't sit here and promise that we'd never have another escape," he 
said. "I can say, though, that with the things that we're doing now, and with 
the staff's attentiveness in doing their jobs, the likelihood of an escape is 
minimal."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS; JUDGE BACKS PLAN TO EXPAND DUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although a Superior Court judge has said he will rule in favor of an expansion 
plan for the Sunshine Canyon Landfill, expansion opponents promised to continue 
the legal battle to halt the project near Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert O'Brien said last week that he intends 
to rule against halting the expansion.But he said he will hold off on the 
ruling long enough for expansion opponents to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The 200-acre landfill, which straddles the city-county boundary in the Santa 
Susana Mountains above Granada Hills, has been a battleground involving the 
landfill operators, Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., and neighbors and Los 
Angeles city officials who oppose the dump's expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 The side of the dump on city property has been closed since 1991, but 
Browning-Ferris plans to expand the landfill on the county side. A coalition of 
landfill neighbors and the city of Los Angeles have sued and filed other legal 
actions to halt the expansion plan. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those actions filed by expansion opponents asks O'Brien to halt the 
expansion until Browning-Ferris has proven, among other things, that the 
landfill is seismically safe in the wake of the Jan. 17 quake. But O'Brien 
indicated that he will rule against the action because he believes that 
opponents must file a separate lawsuit to question the landfill's seismic 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemary Woodlock, an attorney representing landfill neighbors, said Monday 
that she plans to appeal the decision and continue fighting the landfill 
expansion. HUGO MARTIN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: DOCTORS RETURN FROM VIETNAM HOSPITALS TOUR

<P>
 In the orthopedics wing of the largest hospital in Vietnam, Viet Duc Hospital 
in Hanoi, patients lie two to a bed and rely on their families to bring food, 
medicine and clean sheets. A door is the only thing separating a two-table 
operating room from the busy city street. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to three Southland doctors who toured several Vietnamese 
hospitals this month, the dilapidated medical facilities belie the skill of the 
doctors who work there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their yen for learning is phenomenal," said Richard Feldman, a North 
Hollywood surgeon who was one of two San Fernando Valley doctors on the trip. 
"They have the knowledge; they just don't have the equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 Less than three months after a 19-year-old trade embargo against Vietnam was 
lifted, the doctors took part in a 10-day mission to forge ties between the 
medical communities of Vietnam and Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The orthopedic surgeons toured four hospitals in Saigon and Hanoi, giving 
lectures to hundreds of Vietnamese doctors on a variety of procedures such as 
arthroscopic surgery, which the Vietnamese do not practice because they lack 
the sophisticated equipment. They also met with government health officials and 
hospital directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip was the beginning of what the doctors and a Los Angeles businessman 
who organized the group hope will be an ongoing relationship between the 
medical communities. As a result of the trip, American hospitals and medical 
equipment companies have donated equipment and supplies to help the Vietnamese 
update their facilities, and several of the Vietnamese doctors plan to visit 
the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 The California doctors saw their counterparts use hacksaws to cut metal plates 
for use in repairing fractures, watched surgeries, and met patients with a 
variety of ailments and infections. For the doctors, who received some support 
from their hospitals and paid the rest of their expenses themselves, the tour 
offered more than an opportunity to help Vietnamese doctors gain expertise in 
surgical techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started medical school in '68," said Gilbert Jody, a Van Nuys orthopedic 
surgeon. "Vietnam was a central part of our lives." SUSAN BYRNES

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; RESIDENT TO INSTALL 'DUCK CROSSING' SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two animal lovers are crying "fowl" over the city's refusal to erect a stop 
sign on a street where the animal advocates say several ducks have been killed 
by speeding cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking matters into her own hands, Encino resident Kathryn (Aria) Jaeger said 
she has ordered "duck crossing" signs from a private sign maker that she will 
have installed along Moorpark Street between Balboa Boulevard and Petit Avenue. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it'll make a little bit of a difference," Jaeger said. "I don't think 
it's a cure-all." 
</P>
<P>
 Jaeger and part-time Encino resident Gaye Brown said that Los Angeles 
transportation engineer Raymond Wellbaum told them that the city will not 
install stop signs on Moorpark Street where it intersects with La Maida Street, 
as they had requested, because the traffic flow and infrequency of accidents 
there do not warrant the signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wellbaum was not available for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Brown, Wellbaum said that traffic statistics do not warrant speed 
bumps either and that the problem must be solved by law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a month ago, Jaeger and nine neighbors held a funeral for Millie the 
duck on Jaeger's front lawn to publicize the problem of speeding drivers. 
Eleven animals -- five ducks and six squirrels -- have been struck and killed 
by cars in the past few months, according to Jaeger. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles animal control officials said it is residents feeding the 
ducks that is putting their feathered friends in harm's way. Ducks that would 
normally stay in the nearby Los Encinos State Historic Park or Sepulveda Dam 
Recreation Area are instead loitering on a suburban street. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar view was taken by Judith Hirshberg, deputy to Councilman Marvin 
Braude, to whom Jaeger has appealed for help. Driving down Moorpark recently, 
Hirshberg said she saw people standing in the street, feeding ducks.  
</P>
<P>
 "I love the ducks in the ponds, in the lakes and in the parks, but the people 
are not doing them a favor by giving them food in the middle of the road," she 
said. KAY HWANGBO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 5 CHARGED IN SWEEP OF ILLEGAL CONTRACTORS

<P>
 In an ongoing sweep of unlicensed contractors profiting off the 
earthquake-ravaged Southland, Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn filed 
criminal charges Monday against three San Fernando Valley residents and two 
others allegedly found working illegally as unlicensed contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 All five men were charged with contracting without a license after the 
declaration of an emergency, which is punishable by a $1,000 fine and up to a 
year in jail. Jacob Pardal, 53, of Encino, was additionally charged with making 
false and misleading statements, which carries a maximum penalty of six months 
in jail and a $2,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Four were arrested on Feb. 16, the other on March 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests were part of a sweep carried out by investigators from the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Bunco-Forgery Division and the California State 
Contractor's Licensing Board.  
</P>
<P>
 Pardal was arrested in the 9200 block of Crebs Avenue in Northridge, where he 
was removing trees and bushes as part of a quake-repair project. He told 
officers he was hired by the homeowner for $1,300. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Valley residents charged included Daniel Garcia Smith, 62, of Canoga 
Park, who was arrested while repairing a wall at a home in the 1000 block of 
Lindley Avenue in Northridge, a $5,000 project. Jose Reyes Cruz Zuniga, 34, of 
Pacoima, was arrested while rebuilding a wall for $600 in the 9400 block of 
Crebs Avenue. Natividad D. Flores, 43, of Maywood, and Edwin Raul Morales, 39, 
of Los Angeles, were also charged in the sweep. JEFF SCHNAUFER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA/WOODLAND HILLS; 3 SCHOOLS WIN AT SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL 
</P>

<P>
 If to win or not to win was the question at a regional Shakespeare festival 
this weekend, for three San Fernando Valley schools, the answer was a 
resounding win. El Camino High School and George Ellery Hale Middle School of 
Woodland Hills, and Cleveland High School of Reseda took top awards in the 
annual Drama Teachers' Assn. of Southern California Shakespeare Festival, which 
drew 45 high schools from the region for its 75th annual competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really the big event of the year," said Sarah Rosenberg, the drama 
teacher at Cleveland. "It's nice being an L. A. city school and competing 
against a lot of private schools." 
</P>

 The three schools won top awards in their divisions in the 1,400-student

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; HEALTHY CITIES PROJECT FOCUS OF RESOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The city is taking the final steps toward a designation that will provide 
grant money for partnerships involving three area hospitals and churches, 
businesses, the city and the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members will review a resolution today that supports the California 
Healthy Cities Project and allows Glendale to qualify for up to $5,000 in 
yearly funds from the California Healthy Cities program. 
</P>
<P>
 The move also allows the city to apply to the California Department of Health 
for a Healthy City designation. 
</P>
<P>
 Receiving such a designation is largely symbolic -- it shows potential funding 
sources that the city is serious in its efforts to make Glendale a healthier 
community, said Bruce Nelson, director of community services at Glendale 
Adventist Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant funds from the California Healthy Cities program will be used to support 
the "Healthy Kids" program -- a pilot effort providing free health care to 
low-income schoolchildren at Cerritos, Edison, La Crescenta, Mann and Marshall 
schools starting this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort is backed by the Glendale Unified School District, the Glendale 
Adventist Medical Center, Verdugo Hills Hospital and Glendale Memorial 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 If the resolution is approved, the council will form a task force to assess 
health care needs throughout the city. Specific projects will then be designed, 
said Madalyn Blake, director of community development and housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Projects devised by 19 other California cities designated as healthy cities 
include efforts that focus on bicycle safety, smoking cessation, drunk driving, 
children's vaccinations, and voter registration. 
</P>
<P>
 The area's three hospitals formed the Glendale Healthy Community Coalition 
last year to assess the city's health-care needs and will work with the council 
task force. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitals nationwide are trying to redefine their mission from treating 
disease to focusing on disease prevention, said David Igler, vice president of 
Glendale Adventist Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospitals plan to use the coalition to start a parish-nurse program in 
local churches. Parish nurses will be registered nurses or doctors who will 
provide health-care advice and education to parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital administrators have also interviewed area businesses to encourage 
preventive health education and screening programs in companies, Nelson said.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; MORTICIAN WILL TRY TO REVIVE BUSINESS DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Where did Pacoima merchants turn to bring their ailing business district back 
to life? 
</P>
<P>
 Why, to the local mortician, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no joke that the more than 200 members of the Pacoima Chamber of Commerce 
believe that new President Joel Rucker, a local mortician, is the man to bring 
living, breathing, spending customers back to their markets and other 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have stereotyped morticians as men who are stoic and not associated 
with community activities," said Beatrice Hines, the chamber's office manager. 
"But far be it as far as this man is concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Rucker, a widowed father, retired from his job as a science teacher at San 
Fernando High School in 1984 to take over the family business, Rucker's 
Mortuary in Pacoima. He's helped out at the mortuary since he was 8 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Rucker took the two-year mantle as chamber president, he said, because he 
wanted to prove that Pacoima was a safe place in which to live and do business 
-- something he said only a mortician would really know. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the stereotypes, we don't have as many deaths to violent causes as 
they do in other parts of the Valley," said Rucker, 55, a resident of Lake View 
Terrace. "We need to change that image." 
</P>
<P>
 To make that change, Rucker will leave his hearse at the shop and seek out 
merchants to work with police in a new business watch. He also will focus on 
redeveloping blighted areas by championing a proposed federal empowerment zone, 
which could allow businesses and residents in a portion of Pacoima to use part 
of $100 million in tax breaks and other aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The city and county of Los Angeles will propose the empowerment zone to the U. 
S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which will not make a decision 
before September. For merchants who say these measures are not expedient enough 
to solve Pacoima's image problem and return customers to their shops, Rucker 
will call on his experience to soothe them. 
</P>
<P>
 "You learn how to be patient," he said. JEFF SCHNAUFER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; 'TEAM SPIRIT' FLOAT PROPOSED FOR PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine residents will brave fierce rapids on a white-water river-rafting trip 
through a local rock-studded gorge on the city's proposed 1995 Rose Parade 
float entry. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's proposed entry was chosen from among 15 designs, said Nello Iacono, 
director of parks, recreation and community services. 
</P>
<P>
 The entry, titled "Team Spirit" to coincide with the parade's 1995 theme of 
"Sports -- Quest for Excellence," features residents holding floral-covered 
paddles riding a raft perched atop rocks lining a narrow gorge.  
</P>
<P>
 The white-water raft on the 35-foot long, 17-foot high and 18-foot wide float 
will cascade down a floral waterfall of roses and daisies that parade-goers 
will be able to see through, said Bill Lofthouse, president of C. E. Bent & 
Son. 
</P>
<P>
 Based in Pasadena, C. E. Bent & Son is a private contractor that has worked 
with Glendale through the last 25 years to design and build the city's Rose 
Parade float entries. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale's 1994 float entry "A Whale's Tail," featured a California humpback 
whale breaking through the ocean's surface. It received the Mayor's Trophy for 
the best entry by a city. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the 1994 and 1995 float designs were also created to promote an awareness 
of environmental issues and of the state's fragile ecology, Lofthouse said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is scheduled to review the proposed 1995 float design at today's 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the council approves the design, it must vote to fund the $60,000 float 
during budget deliberations for the 1994-95 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction will begin on the 1995 float when the council approves funding 
for the design. It takes about three months to build a float. JENNIFER OLDHAM

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; ELEMENTARY STUDENTS MEET MAYOR RIORDAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon and Mayor Richard Riordan visited 
Pacoima School on Monday, encouraging students to study hard and stay away from 
gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are the future leaders," Riordan told about 150 students, grades 
kindergarten through six, at a brief ceremony in the school's auditorium."Keep 
the city clean, stay away from drugs and you'll have a great future." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan stopped by the school, at 11016 Norris Ave., as part of a tour of 
Alarcon's district, which includes most of the northeast San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted the mayor to come to the middle of our district to see that we have 
hard-working kids," Alarcon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, mostly Latino, prepared a sign for the mayor that read 
"Bienvenido Mr. Riordan," and members of the school's student council had a 
chance to meet their adult counterparts. Riordan spoke a few words of Spanish 
with the kids, then asked if any would teach him the language. Many raised 
their hands -- but more did so when Riordan asked who would someday like to 
have his job. 
</P>
<P>
 One girl asked Riordan what he was doing to combat gangs. He said: "By working 
hard in school, knowing you have interests other than gangs, you will help to 
combat gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan also said he has contacted gang leaders and started youth programs to 
provide alternatives to the gang lifestyle. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

CHICK SEEKS LARGER LAPD PLANNING ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to make buildings less vulnerable to crime, Los Angeles City 
Councilwoman Laura Chick will recommend today that police become more involved 
in the city's planning process. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick's program, which she calls Design Out Crime, would have police suggest 
the use of lighting, fences and landscaping to make proposed homes and business 
less vulnerable to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the city of Los Angeles addresses crime, we must look beyond traditional 
methods of policing to examine whether all of our policies might enhance public 
safety," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chick's proposal received a lukewarm reception by a zoning official. 
Albert Landini, an associate zoning administrator for the city, said the idea 
of designing buildings to better deter crime -- known among planners as 
building "defensible space" -- is a "vague" concept that has not been entirely 
effective in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see anything that police can suggest that we haven't already thought 
of," Landini said. On many occasions, he added, aesthetic qualities are lost 
when designers concentrate too much on deterring crime. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the city's current approval process, proposed projects such as 
liquor stores, bars, massage parlors and billiard halls are normally referred 
to the local police division for comments and suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ken Bernstein, Chick's planning deputy, said the councilwoman's efforts 
would expand police participation to have the force comment on all types of 
business and residential projects early in the approval process. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, he said, can make recommendations on how to improve visibility to 
allow neighbors to keep an eye on one another or suggest how to use lighting 
and fencing to eliminate hiding areas for criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these things can be done without having to build fortress-like 
projects," Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick's motion asks the Los Angeles Police Department, the city's Planning 
Department and other agencies to convene a Design Out Crime working group. If 
the City Council approves the motion, the group would be required to draft the 
recommendations within 60 days.

STATE FIRES WORKERS' COMP JUDGE ACCUSED OF MOLESTING LAWYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A veteran workers' compensation judge arrested on charges of sexually 
molesting a female lawyer in his Van Nuys chambers has been ordered fired by 
state officials, authorities confirmed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The termination of Judge Stanley Samuel Feinstein, 61, was issued April 20 by 
the state Department of Industrial Relations. It was backdated to become 
effective April 4, the day he was placed on a paid administrative leave of 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same day the firing was confirmed, Feinstein was ordered released on 
his own recognizance after pleading not guilty to felony criminal charges that 
he fondled the attorney during a March 28 visit to his office. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said Feinstein is the only state workers' compensation judge 
in recent memory to be fired in connection with alleged criminal activity. 
There are about 175 such judges in the state at any given time, appointed 
through the civil service system. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been dismissed, for willful disobedience, insubordination and bringing 
discredit to the agency, all based on his refusal to cooperate with our 
internal investigation and to answer questions," said Richard Stephens, 
spokesman for the department's Division of Workers' Compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can only think of one other case in recent years where a judge resigned 
under pressure. We don't know of anyone else who has been dismissed." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephens said Feinstein's dismissal was based on the judge's refusal to answer 
a department investigator's questions about the alleged molestation during an 
interview April 15 at his lawyer's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's firing was unfair, his lawyer said, because he was only asking 
that his questioning in the administrative case be postponed until after 
disposition of the criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though he is innocent, he didn't want to compromise his rights in the 
criminal case," said lawyer Philip Israels. "We said we'd cooperate fully, but 
to let us take care of the criminal matter first." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was not terminated for assaulting (the lawyer)," Israels said. "He was 
terminated for not answering questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein has not yet decided whether to appeal his termination, Israels said. 
In the meantime, the state's administrative investigation into his activities 
will continue, according to state officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still trying to gather whatever information we can until it's over 
with," said Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Monday arraignment hearing in a Downtown courthouse, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Carol Straughn asked that Feinstein's bail be continued at $15,000. But 
Municipal Judge L. Jeffrey Wiatt found that the workers' compensation judge, 
who was allowed to turn himself into police earlier this month after an arrest 
warrant was issued, was not a flight risk or a threat to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy has been on the bench for 22 years, and raised his family here in 
California," said Israels. "He's not going anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, who had no comment during the brief court hearing, has denied 
molesting or fondling the attorney. The alleged victim said in a recent 
interview with The Times that she was so upset that she couldn't return to 
full-time work. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times has a policy of not identifying alleged victims in sexual 
molestation cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say they have gathered corroborating evidence that Feinstein 
admitted to the alleged victim that the molestation took place, and that he was 
sorry it happened. But Israels said anything Feinstein might have said to the 
victim must be taken in the context of a man being accused of something he did 
not do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone who is accused of sexual misconduct is apt to say anything to placate 
his accuser," Israels said. "Stanley Feinstein didn't assault (the lawyer) in 
any way, sexually or otherwise. He is innocent and we expect him to be 
completely cleared of these charges." 
</P>
<P>
 The 40-year-old lawyer alleges that Feinstein prevented her from leaving his 
chambers by pushing her against a wall, and then grabbed her breast and kissed 
her. The complaint alleges that Feinstein unlawfully restrained and touched her 
for "the purpose of sexual arousal, sexual gratification and sexual abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, who worked out of the State Office Building in the Van Nuys 
Government Center, entered his plea in Los Angeles Municipal Court to single 
counts of sexual battery by restraint and false imprisonment by violence. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, he faces a maximum of four years on the sexual battery charge 
and three years on the false imprisonment by violence charge.

PACOIMA MAN GETS LIFE SENTENCE IN SUPERMARKET SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling the murder "unspeakably disgusting," a judge handed down a life prison 
sentence to a Pacoima man convicted in a series of supermarket robberies that 
ended with the slaying of a salesman who was on the phone with his fiancee. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Sandy Kriegler sentenced Jose Santillan to 26 
years to life in prison for his role in the murder of Robert Ward Jr., who was 
shot to death during an Oct. 19, 1992, robbery at a Ralphs supermarket in Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 While Santillan, 20, did not pull the trigger, he is responsible for Ward's 
death under legal doctrine that makes criminals liable for murder if anyone 
dies during the course of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who pulled the trigger and another man wanted in the crime spree have 
never been caught. Authorities believe that they have fled to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 After the sentencing, Ward's fiancee, Kandace Rae Worley, described how she 
was speaking with her future husband when "there was a pause, and then I heard 
a gunshot. (Later,) I could hear the paramedics trying to resuscitate him." 
</P>
<P>
 Worley, a Lancaster resident who is now 33, said she had been engaged to Ward, 
a 28-year-old Palmdale resident, for nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward's sister, Caroline Holland of Granada Hills, acknowledged that Santillan, 
like her murdered brother, was the father of a child, but she asked for a stiff 
sentence. "I will pray for his baby," Holland said in court, "and I hope Jose 
Santillan prays for himself." 
</P>
<P>
 A handcuffed Santillan, who wore a blue jail jumpsuit and a plastic rosary 
around his neck, showed no emotion as Holland and Worley spoke in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a terrible way to die," Kriegler said of the shooting, "but having 
someone on the other end of the line to hear that is unspeakably disgusting." 
</P>
<P>
 The same jury that convicted Santillan in Ward's death earlier this month also 
found him guilty of 20 counts of robbery stemming from eight separate holdups 
during a three-week period. The judge added nearly 23 years to Santillan's life 
term for "inflicting terror throughout supermarkets in the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no physical evidence to link Santillan to any of the robberies, but 
during the trial two people who were in the store when Ward was shot positively 
identified Santillan as one of the two robbers. Another witness said he saw 
Santillan in the parking lot moments after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ralph's at Sherman Way and Woodman Avenue where Ward was killed was robbed 
twice during the crime spree. 
</P>
<P>
 Kriegler noted that Santillan and his accomplices became more brazen as the 
robberies continued. Three supermarkets were robbed the day Ward was gunned 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Dennis Cohen asked that the sentences for robberies run at 
the same time as the 26 years to life for the murder. "We know Mr. Santillan is 
not the killer, (and) we know Mr. Santillan turned himself in," Cohen said, 
noting that the life sentence means Santillan may never be paroled. 
</P>
<P>
 After announcing that the robbery charges would add another 22 years and 8 
months to the sentence, Kriegler said he hopes to punish Santillan and to deter 
others from committing violent crimes.

 Shopping in the San Fernando Valley, which a wag once suggested should be 
renamed "Twenty-Nine Malls," hasn't been the same since the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
Out of commission are the Northridge Fashion Center and Sherman Oaks Fashion 
Square and department stores at Topanga Plaza and several other malls. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles A. Bearchell, a retired marketing professor at Cal State Northridge 
and author of "Retailing: A Professional Approach" and "The San Fernando Valley 
Then and Now," tells Times staff writer Ann W. O'Neill that malls can serve a 
valuable role in the community's social sense of well-being, as well as provide 
an economic barometer. Since the quake, Bearchell has noticed a new Valley 
phenomenon, which he calls shopping deprivation. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Shopping deprivation, what is that? Are we going through mall 
withdrawal?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Shopping deprivation is a disruption of one's normal shopping behavior 
through lack of availability of previously shopped centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Picture this: You have been living in the Valley for many years, and as part 
of your regular behavior you have been going once, perhaps more times, per week 
to the shopping center to check on clothes in general, or perhaps to react to 
some special ad from your favorite department store or specialty shop. This is 
a part of your life. 
</P>
<P>
 Bang! The earthquake strikes. Your home and the ground on which you stand are 
shaken vigorously, and many of your personal and social contacts are broken 
with telephones out of order, utilities gone and normal supply lines cut off. 
For folks in the Valley this meant a sudden deprivation of shopping 
opportunities at all of the major shopping centers and indeed in many of the 
supermarkets as well. During the ensuing days and weeks you are busy picking up 
the pieces, dealing with inspectors, adjusters, insurance agents and 
contractors to return to normal. When you want to get out of the house and 
simply browse in the local mall, you can't do it. 
</P>
<P>
 But look -- the newspapers are full of their ads. There are sales you cannot 
attend, bargains you can't get unless you drive far away from your normal 
shopping locations. If this isn't a clear-cut example of shopping deprivation, 
I don't know what is. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did you come up with the notion that such a phenomenon exists in the 
post-quake Valley?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It is based on my own experience. Out of curiosity, we drove over to the 
Topanga mall when Nordstrom opened a few weeks ago. That a large number of 
people were waiting to get into a shopping center was fascinating to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So, there must be symptoms of shopping deprivation. What should we expect 
to feel?  
</P>
<P>
 A: A desire to get out of the house. A wish to see what is new. A desire to 
follow up on the ideas which persisted, in the form of newspaper ads, but had 
no physical presence. One of the problems which people face is the continuing 
flow of information on sales which may very well be attractive but can't be 
reached through one's local contacts. If everybody else can go to the store, 
and the store feels it's worthwhile advertising, I am going to feel deprived in 
not being able to do what I have done before. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there some basic, primordial need that shopping fulfills? Some vestige 
from our specie's days as hunter-gatherers?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I would not associate it with hunter-gatherers, but rather label it as an 
artifact of man's social instincts. It affords people the chance to move from 
their homes out to crowds and meet people, see people, watch people, talk to 
people. It makes us feel less isolated. Traditionally, shopping was a social 
event, as well as an economic event where people just went to acquire 
something. They also often went to meet other people and exchange ideas. This 
goes way back. It still happens now. Many of us will go to a certain store and 
at least socialize a little with some clerk with whom we've become familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So people must be feeling pretty isolated by now. Does this make us cranky, 
give us ulcers, take years off our lives?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Relatively speaking, compared to our status before the earthquake -- yes. 
Obviously, we have many problems in our lives which probably far transcend the 
simple unavailability of our friendly department store. But in terms of 
previous behavior, we're blocked from doing what we would like to do. It is 
probably going to be a transitory phase for most of us and as things move back 
to "natural" that deprivation will gradually disappear. But as you suggested, a 
certain amount of crankiness or frustration will undoubtedly continue until our 
friendly shopping centers are back on line. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Meanwhile, I'm certainly saving lots of money.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yeah, I've noticed that too. Unfortunately the savings there is taken up by 
expenses of taking down chimneys and replacing broken glassware. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are there different degrees of shoppers, say, hard-core shopping addicts 
versus casual recreational shoppers?  
</P>
<P>
 A: On its very basic level, the economic aspect of shopping focuses on the 
satisfaction of a given need through the expense in both time and dollars of 
searching for that particular product which meets our needs best. Beyond that 
point, however, there are many people who will emphasize social contact with 
the seller of the goods they inspect and indeed build up personal friendships 
with merchants whom they frequent often. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have you noticed the ads for the Beverly Center, inviting us to go over the 
hill to shop till we drop?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I have not been there, but I am sure some people have. The outlying 
shopping centers are doing their best to change people's shopping habits and 
patterns. If the Glendale Galleria can get people to come there one or two 
times, they may be locked into shopping there regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Omigod, could this mean the end of the Valley Girl mall culture?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I doubt it. The growth of the "mall culture" is an artifact of the nature 
of shopping behavior and economics of people who live in spread-out communities 
without clearly defined lines of public transportation and with a relatively 
high level of affluence which the developers of malls tap through careful 
placement of shopping centers filled with careful assortments of general and 
specialized merchandise. The Valley is a situation where people use their own 
cars more and are able to go shopping at the drop of a hat. I see them 
shopping, and they're to go out at all times of the day and night. The 
advantage of taking your own car means you can pile more goods into it on the 
way home. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Sounds like it's going to get pretty competitive out there in Retail Land.  
</P>
<P>
 A: It always has been. There always are going to be winners and losers. The 
retail business is not a static operation. There is a give and take among 
retailers with a ruthless law of consumer demand which guarantees no one, no 
seller, a continuing place in history. Witness the demise and radical changes 
in department store chain ownership in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: At some point, will we experience some huge, communal shopping spree to 
make up for lost mall crawling?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's hard to say whether a developing forced economic measure will continue 
or whether people will go on splurges or sprees. We just don't know. It remains 
to be seen from Valley shopping center profit-and-loss statements from the next 
year or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will the quake permanently change our shopping habits?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think we will see a gradual change in shopping habits, with the 
technological developments of the computer-television interactive video and the 
widespread availability of credit data, which make possible long-distance 
purchases and sales with high levels of security for both customer and seller. 
</P>
<P>
 The continual competition will lead to development of new retail sales 
methods, more home shopping and computer-cable relationships. Valley businesses 
will focus more on specialized segments of population, or narrow segments of 
people to more fully meet the needs of those people, as well as take advantage 
of technological advances. We're going to see some incredible changes. That's 
entirely aside from the quake.

RESTAURANT MANAGER'S TEA BOTTLE TOSS FOILS ARMED ROBBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Given his choice of weapons, Charles Wesley would rather arm himself with a 
pistol than a bottle of Snapple every time. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the wee hours of Monday morning, when he hurled the bottle at a man 
with a gun, the 31-year-old restaurant manager found that a well-aimed 
lemon-flavored iced tea can do the job quite nicely. 
</P>
<P>
 From about 15 feet away, Wesley hit the masked man, who was dressed in black 
like a Ninja, with the bottle in the face. That gave Wesley enough time to 
flee, dodging bullets all the way, said Lt. Michael Moore of the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I beat him to the draw," said Wesley, a soft-spoken Brooklyn native 
whose wife is five months pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was actually Wesley's second crime-fighting adventure. In 1982, 
he tackled a man who had robbed a woman at knifepoint outside a Panorama City 
supermarket, for which he was feted by the mayor, police chief and County Board 
of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's incident began about 12:15 a.m., when Wesley, 31, was locking up at 
the Red Robin restaurant on Calabasas Road and heading home, Moore said. As he 
walked to his car, Wesley saw a man jump into shrubbery at the edge of the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Wesley said he thought he had stumbled upon someone relieving himself. He 
tried to startle the man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going, 'OK, whoever's in the bushes, come out!' " Wesley said. The man 
complied. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy jumps out in this all-black, Ninja-type outfit, wearing a ski mask 
and has this gun pointed at me," Wesley said. "I thought he was going to kill 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 The man, kneeling in a firing position, told Wesley to freeze, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Wesley reached into a pocket for the iced tea he had planned to drink 
on the way home and threw it at the man. "I was very lucky to hit him," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wesley said he ran, taking cover first behind a wall and then running in a 
zigzag to avoid bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 The man shot and missed three times, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't recommend this type of thing," said Moore. "But in this case, it 
did work . . . and no one got hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Wesley blamed his upbringing. "I grew up in Brooklyn," he said, "so I guess it 
just comes second nature." 
</P>
<P>
 Two other employees who were leaving the restaurant at the time told deputies 
they heard the gunfire and then saw the black-outfitted man hop into a two-door 
black Cadillac or Monte Carlo and drive away, Moore said. The man escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 When Wesley detained the armed robber in Panorama City 12 years ago, he won 
citations and commendations from some of the city's most powerful people. This 
time, all he got was a couple of days off. Still, he believes he did the right 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was going to rob me, then kill me," Wesley said. "My wife's 
birthday is in two days and I didn't want to miss it."

HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT GETS STATE ULTIMATUM ON DISPUTED CLAS TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State education officials Monday issued their ultimatum to the Antelope Valley 
Union High School District in writing: Reverse the decision not to administer 
the disputed CLAS test by May 6 or face a legal battle. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the three school board members who voted not to give the test 
said the state Department of Education may seek their removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Supt. of Public Instruction William D. Dawson ordered the high school 
district, which last week became the first in the state to refuse to give the 
controversial test, to administer it by June 15. In a letter made public 
Monday, state officials warn the district that, if necessary, the department 
will seek a court order mandating that the test be administered. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, from attorney Joseph R. Symkowick, declares that the Antelope 
Valley board has exceeded its authority and has "no discretion to refuse to 
administer the CLAS test."  
</P>
<P>
 The California Learning Assessment System test has come under fire from some 
parents and political groups who contend the literature portions of the test 
contain passages that denigrate the family. The secrecy surrounding the test, 
which the state says is necessary to ensure its integrity, has also been 
criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rutherford Institute, a conservative civil-liberties organization, on 
Monday filed suit in Sacramento seeking a temporary restraining order to stop 
the Department of Education from having school districts administer the test 
without allowing parents to exempt their children. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed on behalf of parents in Sacramento, is the first against 
the Department of Education over the CLAS test but follows the filing of more 
than a dozen against individual school districts over the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of school districts in California are allowing parents to exempt 
their children from taking the exam, despite warnings from the Department of 
Education that exemptions are prohibited. The Antelope Valley district is the 
first to refuse to administer the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley district board members are scheduled to meet in closed session 
May 5 with their attorney to discuss the implications of the 3-2 decision the 
conservative majority made last week not to administer the test. 
</P>
<P>
 It's uncertain, however, if the decision will be reversed, despite the promise 
of legal action and the threat of removal from the Department of Education. A 
little-used portion of the government code allows for removal of school board 
members for failing to perform their duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still investigating the CLAS test and have not weakened in my resolve," 
said board member Sue Stokka, who voted April 20 with President Billy Pricer 
and member Tony Welch not to administer the test. "I am totally convinced that 
what I'm doing is right and the test is as wrong as a test can be." 
</P>
<P>
 Stokka said the Department of Education's response was expected and will not 
intimidate her. "They're going to try to force us to fall in line. They want us 
to obey." 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Bill Olenick, who with member Wilda Andrejcik voted against the 
majority, said: "I am still hopeful the board will reverse its decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Olenick believes the decision would harm the district financially. Attorney 
Frank J. Fekete said defending a suit brought by the Department of Education 
could easily cost $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hopeful the board will reverse its decision based on that," Olenick said. 
"If not, it's going to be a long ride." 
</P>
<P>
 Stokka said she does not think a legal battle would be costly for the district 
because there are several individuals and groups, including the Rutherford 
Institute, that have offered to assist should the matter end up in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Welch and Pricer could not be reached Monday for comment.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; FEW ATTEND COLLEGE'S HANDICAPPED AWARENESS 
DAY; DISABILITIES: NO ONE SHOWS UP FOR PROGRAM'S SHOWCASE EVENT. ORGANIZERS 
BLAME RAIN, IN PART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 College of the Canyons students and faculty members Monday were invited to 
face the everyday challenges that come with a disability. 
</P>
<P>
 They declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the community college's second annual Handicapped Awareness Day 
wanted volunteers to go about their daily business for an hour using a 
wheelchair or a walker or while blindfolded. 
</P>
<P>
 No one showed up for the demonstration, which is considered the showcase event 
of the awareness program. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainy weather moved the event indoors and may have dissuaded some, said Joe 
Cedillo, a student government officer who helped coordinate the program. 
Thirteen people participated last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody got word of this. Everyone knows it's going on," Cedillo said, 
standing by a pair of empty wheelchairs and unused walkers, waiting for an 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen people attended a talk later in the morning by Santa Clarita 
businessman Gary Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who runs a computer company and is active in the Santa Clarita Valley 
Chamber of Commerce, had both of his legs amputated below the knee about 10 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Individuals aren't aware of what we're going through," he said in a mostly 
upbeat speech, which also told of strangers crossing the street to avoid 
walking past him. "A lot of it is fear -- fear of getting involved, fear of 
touching and catching something. It's ignorance is what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters say they're happy to get their message out, even if only a small 
audience hears it. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of success -- two people would've been a success," Cedillo said, 
noting the Handicapped Awareness Day wouldn't exist if not for student creator 
Randell Resneder. 
</P>
<P>
 Resneder, 20, modeled the event after a program he began at William S. Hart 
High School in 1988 when he was a student there. No one in College of the 
Canyons' student government wanted to take on the project, but Resneder 
persuaded them after five visits, Cedillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that I felt sorry for him. It's that he's so motivated and kept 
coming," Cedillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Resneder launched the awareness programs after being harassed about the 
symptoms of his cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
 "When students asked me where was my mommy, I knew I had to do something about 
it," Resneder said. "If they won't change for me, maybe they'll change for 
Disabled Students (Services and Programs)." 
</P>
<P>
 Disabled Students Services and Programs provides assistance to about 170 
College of the Canyons students who have some sort of disability. Resneder is 
transferring to Cal State Northridge next year and hopes Handicapped Awareness 
Day will continue at the College of the Canyons without him.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY LAUDS COWBOY POETRY FEST'S BOTTOM LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials are heralding the three-day Cowboy Poetry, Music and Film 
Festival as a "huge success" because it cost the city under $2,700 to sponsor, 
tens of thousands of dollars less than originally anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that if the earthquake hadn't happened, we would have made money on 
this," said spokeswoman Gail Foy. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff originally estimated that the event, held the weekend of March 25, 
could cost the city as much as $43,000 to sponsor. Following the Northridge 
earthquake, expenses were expected to rise when the location had to be switched 
from the quake-damaged Hart High School auditorium to Melody Ranch, which cost 
$15,000 to rent. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are expecting to receive $22,500 in FEMA funds to help offset 
the additional costs incurred due to the quake, which will leave with a $2,697 
bill for the event, Foy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Foy also said that 3,255 festival tickets were sold out of a possible 3,625. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials estimate that the event pumped $244,000 into the local economy, 
with the average festival-goer spending more than $81 in the Santa Clarita 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival organizers had wanted to create a large-scale tourist event that 
would bring visitors to Santa Clarita to strengthen the 6-year-old city's 
economy.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SANTA CLARITA CITY HALL WILL REOPEN AFTER 
QUAKE MONDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Santa Clarita will celebrate the reopening of City Hall, which 
suffered millions of dollars in damage during the Northridge earthquake, with a 
ribbon-cutting ceremony Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The reopening of City Hall should come as a relief to the public and to city 
officials and staff who were forced to work out of trailers and tents in the 
City Hall parking lot for more than two weeks following the January temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 The city subsequently moved its offices to temporary quarters off Golden 
Triangle Road in Saugus, where they have been located during the reconstruction 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs to the City Hall building at 23920 Valencia Blvd., which suffered an 
estimated $4.5 million in damage during the quake, were completed on time and 
on budget, said Gail Foy, a city spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last three months, 41 steel-reinforcement beams have been added to 
make the building 25% stronger, Foy said. The building also received a fresh 
coat of paint and new carpet. 
</P>
<P>
 City workers are scheduled to pack office materials Friday and have their 
belongings moved to City Hall over the weekend so that they can unpack Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The reopening ceremony coincides with a revised work schedule for city staff 
and officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to reduce pollution by taking cars off the road, city employees 
will begin working nine-hour days, allowing City Hall to close every other 
Friday. 
</P>

 "H ow do you spell relief?"  
</P>
<P>
 The boss asks a simple question -- but you might as well be asked to recite 
the Declaration of Independence in Urdu. 
</P>
<P>
 In a second, you are transported back to the palm-sweating ignominy of Mrs. 
Davenport's sixth-grade class. Thursday, Spelling Day. The day the 
apple-polishing Good Spellers go to the front of the class for their gold 
stars. The day you slink down in the chair to dodge your snickering classmates 
and escape the steely gaze of Mrs. Davenport, the oracle of orthography, whose 
pursed lips say it all: You are about to commit the linguistic equivalent of 
blowing your nose into your dinner napkin. You can't spell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Um, R-E-L-E-I-F?" 
</P>
<P>
 So in a world where people are judged not by their quality of mind but by the 
correctness of their spelling, there will be no relief for you. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Graffito on a UC Berkeley kiosk: "Bad spellers of the world, untie!" 
</P>
<P>
 Call them the orthographically challenged. (Or OCs, if you will.) They wander 
the land with advanced degrees; high-profile jobs; wicked takes on history, art 
and the state of the world. And as they wander, they secretly pray that no one 
will ask them to spell it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid when I open my mouth to talk, it'll come out misspelled," says 
Ronnie Caplane, a contributing editor to an antiques magazine. "It's 
excruciating. I break out into a sweat when I have to write notes to my 
children's teachers: 'Please excuse Morgan's a-b-s-e-n-t-s . . . a-b-c-e-n . . 
.' Forget it. 'Morgan was not at school. She had a cold.' Heaven help us if she 
ever got pneumonia." 
</P>
<P>
 So why not use the dictionary? 
</P>
<P>
 They try. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've spent hours getting lost in the dictionary. When you're a bad speller, 
you can spend days in there and never find what you're looking for," says 
Christa Rudolph-Freund, a Marin County teacher working toward a doctorate in 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was writing my master's thesis, I'd call up the long distance 
operators in the middle of the night and say: 'How do you spell colonel ?' It 
isn't k-e-r, or c-e-r, or any other logical thing you could think of. The 
operators were always helpful. If they didn't know the answer, they'd ask the 
one sitting next to them." 
</P>
<P>
 And the spell-checker?  
</P>
<P>
 It can't follow you everywhere, and even if it could, its knot all ways rite 
any whey; after all, it's only a machine. 
</P>
<P>
 So the bad spellers cope. They forge ahead, hoping to find forgiving souls 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I turn in a piece, my editor assumes all my misspellings are 
typos. I say, 'Yes, they're typos,' " says John Seabrook, a writer at the New 
Yorker, who says his writing style reflects years of trying to avoid words he 
couldn't spell. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Dan Quayle misspelled potato , I actually felt sorry for him. And I had 
to think for a minute how to spell it. I take great solace in F. Scott 
Fitzgerald, who was a terrible speller -- truly unbelievable. If you look at 
his unedited journals, you'd think he was almost illiterate." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's strange that we should place so much importance on whether the I comes 
before the E except after the C . . . except when it's weird . . . or their . . 
. or leisure . . . or. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But we do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spelling is one of the easiest ways to categorize people by behavior. It's 
highly visible, easily documentable," says Ronald Macaulay, professor of 
linguistics at Pitzer College and author of several books on the sociology of 
language. "It's relatively trivial, but hard to master if you don't master it 
at a young age. It's attaching tremendous significance to something trivial, 
but visible -- like table manners." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. If you want to get that job, get the peas off the knife, the spinach 
out of the teeth, and keep up the good-spelling front. Lie about it. Write 
around it. Lean on the spell-checker. Get someone else to spell it for you. 
Avoid the written word altogether. But then . . . then comes that moment your 
guard is down, your cover gets blown, and the wrath of the real world descends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people who can't spell worth a damn are very good writers," says Rene J. 
Cappon, general news editor at the Associated Press in New York and author of 
"The Word," an AP guide to good writing. "But if you get a resume or a letter 
about a job with five words misspelled -- or in our writing test, if someone 
turns out to be a supremely poor speller -- you have to say, 'Now, wait a 
minute.' It's clearly a mark against them." 
</P>
<P>
 Ouch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope I never meet a man so narrow that he can spell a word in only one way. 
" -- Thomas Jefferson 
</P>
<P>
 Once, not so long ago, it wasn't such a bad thing to be a bad speller. Or, 
let's say, a democratic speller. At one time in Britain, you could tell what 
region a personal letter came from by the way it was spelled. Shakespeare 
spelled the same word two ways on two lines and signed his name with three 
combinations of letters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody cared," Pitzer linguist Macaulay says. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in the middle 18th Century, all orthographic hell broke loose. Dr. Samuel 
Johnson, a raving classicist, compiled a dictionary. One that remained true to 
the roots of the language, with its ancientisms, silent Ds, hidden Cs, vexing 
oughs and I's before Es. At about the same time, members of a newly literate 
English middle class were devouring tips from social critics who fed them 
models for Correct Behavior. They acquired fish forks and magazines. They 
folded their napkins and scrubbed their dialects. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden, spelling came to loom large as a measure of literacy," says 
Dennis Baron, professor of English and linguistics at University of Illinois, 
Urbana. "It became one of those benchmarks that said you had made it into the 
cultural elite." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mrs. Davenports of the world took up the cause with relish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in a special college-prep course in high school, and the spelling tests 
given as a means of raising your grade were supposed to be seen as largess on 
the part of the instructor," says Bob Calhoun, a bad-spelling professor of law 
at San Francisco's Golden Gate University. "To me, it was nothing but misery. 
But I was lucky. I decided at an early age that the problem wasn't me. It was 
English spelling." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In their heart of hearts, most bad spellers know that their lot has nothing to 
do with lack of intelligence or even schooling. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say it may be related to a weakness in visual memory or trouble with 
step-by-step sequencing. Anywhere from 10% to 23% of the population -- maybe 
more -- suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not clear whether it's a miswiring, a misfiring or even a difference in 
(brain) structure," says Janet Ewart Eddy, director of the department of 
learning services at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it a simple brain glitch, one that does not compute the subtleties of the 
orthographic nightmare known as the English language: Three main strains of 
ancient influence, scads of assimilated foreignisms, acres of spellings that 
haven't changed since Chaucer's time, and an unlikely storehouse of 20,000 
commonly used words -- only 20% of which look the way they sound. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Mrs. Davenports of the world, guardians of the hallowed cause of form, 
don't care. They live for one purpose: To question not only your intelligence 
(and maybe your breeding), but your very worth as a human being. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a freshman in college, I turned in an English composition paper 
for this nasty troll of a man and, naturally, it was full of spelling errors," 
says a 50-year-old Oakland author who says her publisher cringes each time she 
turns in an otherwise perfect manuscript. 
</P>
<P>
 "This professor wrote all the errors on the board and he sort of sneered, 'I 
don't know how this person got into this class.' The implication was that I 
should have been in bonehead English. He didn't use my name, but I was so red 
I'm sure everyone knew who it was," she says. "But success is vindication 
enough. It makes people like that furious to see people they've deemed 
inadequate succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 Aaaah , Revenge of the Bad Spellers. They may not be able to juggle the 
alphabet, but many of them are smart. As smart as their tormentors are 
shortsighted. The best and brightest include the rich and powerful: Gen. George 
Patton, President Harry Truman, philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, computer czar 
Bill Gates, novelist Fitzgerald, to name a handful. 
</P>
<P>
 Pity the judgmental Good Speller who one day ends up working for a Bad 
Speller. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have this fantasy," says antiques writer-bad speller Caplane. "My first 
boss, this thoroughly humiliating person I had to plug into my ear while he 
dictated his letters, ends up being the proofreader on my best-selling novel. 
I'd be very gracious and kind about it -- but I'd make sure that he knew what 
his job was." 
</P>
<P>
 Too-shay.

WHEN BURN GOES BUST; MIND GAMES MAY HELP YOU LOSE THE BOREDOM AND PUMP UP YOUR

 Just about every inch of Susan Jacobs' Burbank bedroom is functional. There's 
the floral comforter (for warmth), the oak desk (for writing), the long dresser 
(for storing clothes) and that darn NordicTrack (for decoration). 
</P>
<P>
 "I begged my husband for a NordicTrack for my birthday last year," the 
37-year-old nurse says. "He told me, 'It'll become a clothes hanger.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Jacobs disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Jacobs gave in. 
</P>
<P>
 She used it three times a week . . . for a month and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it's resting comfortably at the foot of their bed. Meanwhile, under the 
bed of a 49-year-old Los Angeles woman is an aerobic slide that is slowly 
becoming one big dust ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used it for about two and a half months, twice a week," she says. "I 
thought it would be easy. I saw those ads on television, you know, with those 
women in elastic bike shorts who don't sweat." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, she grew tired of setting up the slide each time. Under the bed it 
went. Under the bed it has stayed.

 Every day in Southern California, countless pieces of exercise equipment are 
laid to rest by once-well-intentioned owners. At first, these exercisers 
embraced this equipment like a new neighborhood Starbucks. Then something 
happened: Boredom. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: Exercise equipment cemeteries started to pop up -- ranging from 
tiny bedroom shrines with a stationary bike tucked in a corner; to larger 
memorials in basement closets, filled to the clothes' rack with Thighmasters, 
barbells and jump ropes; to the Forest Lawn of exercise equipment: the thrift 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do collect quite a lot of exercise equipment," says Dave Morris, fleet 
manager for Goodwill Industries in Los Angeles. "Anything from old but usable 
exercise bikes to fairly elaborate machines such as home gyms, and everything 
in between" -- including steppers, stairclimbers and treadmills. A recent 
bonanza: a home gym that "took up half the truck," Morris says. 
</P>
<P>
 How did it come to pass that the Lifecycle you vowed to be faithful to is 
making Dave Morris a happy man? Is there a way to put the fire back in your 
workout? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The showroom of the Busybody store on Central Avenue in Glendale is 
wall-to-wall with home fitness equipment and an aura of promise. On display 
near the front door is a home weight-training station. Treadmills line one 
wall. In between are cross-country ski machines, stairclimbers, rowers and 
exercise bikes. 
</P>
<P>
 On this particular Saturday afternoon, store manager Ted Gorzny is closing a 
sale with James Petrie of West Covina. Petrie balances his toddler daughter on 
one hip and grins contentedly as his wife, Carmela, browses nearby with their 
toddler son. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always a fight about who's going to the gym (and who's staying home 
to watch the kids)," Petrie says. But those little spats will soon be history. 
In a matter of days, the home gym they have just purchased -- $1,400, including 
accessories -- will be delivered and set up in their garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Will it end up catching dust? Or building muscle? 
</P>
<P>
 Muscle, says Petrie, who is part of a growing group of exercisers who have 
opted to work out in the privacy of their homes. Retail sales of exercise 
equipment in 1992 topped $2 billion, according to the National Sporting Goods 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But while sales of exercise equipment are booming, the percentage of adult 
Americans engaged in regular exercise (20 minutes, three times a week), has 
remained fairly stable at about 20% over the past several years, says Rod 
Dishman, an exercise scientist at the University of Georgia, Athens. 
</P>
<P>
 What Dishman and other exercise experts are trying to figure out is, with all 
these home exercise options, why can't most people stick with it? Probably 
two-thirds drop out, estimates Larry Gettman, an exercise physiologist and vice 
president for research and development at National Health Enhancement Systems 
in Phoenix. (The drop-out rate at health clubs is about the same, he says.) 
</P>
<P>
 There's no simple answer. Among the possible reasons the exercise attention 
span is so short: 
</P>
<P>
 * Not everyone is cut out to be a successful home exerciser. (The Los Angeles 
woman who slid her slide under the bed returned to her gym.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Some people are suited to home workouts but choose the wrong equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Others don't know how to stay motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 * Others have unrealistic expectations -- they do too much too fast and end up 
sore and discouraged. (It's always best to consult a doctor before beginning or 
resuming an exercise program.) 
</P>
<P>
 Madison Avenue also deserves some of the blame, in Dishman's view. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exercise equipment is marketed as many other products are," he says. "The 
image sold is one of changing the physique. Not just changing it a little bit 
but changing it a lot, in a short period of time. The reality is, biology 
doesn't change that quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 In advertisements, equipment manufacturers tend to show the fit -- not the fat 
-- working out, Dishman says, which makes the situation worse. No one stops to 
think that these models, besides being genetically blessed, probably work out 
two hours a day, six days a week -- a schedule few people can maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you start out with this image, you are doomed," Dishman says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ditto if you start out with the wrong equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Step on this treadmill, go ahead," coaxes Mike Cirillo, co-owner of the 
Fitness Store in Granada Hills. The treadmill in question, he explains, is a 
nationally advertised but, in his opinion, substandard model. He keeps it for 
demonstration purposes, he says, to persuade consumers to test machines for how 
they feel and perform rather than to buy strictly based on name recognition and 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if you want to watch TV while working out on an exercise bike, 
you should make sure that the bike isn't too loud. Otherwise, this could lead 
to another bike taking up space in an exercise equipment "graveyard" such as 
the Fitness Store's secondhand outlet, which buys from burned-out exercisers 
and customers wanting to upgrade. 
</P>
<P>
 Another obstacle to home exercise is the lack of social reinforcement, found 
in health clubs and at running tracks and walking paths. But if you can't get 
to that smelly gym, Dishman suggests that you re-create that environment by 
asking loved ones to prod and encourage you -- or even join you. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the "I'll get my money's worth" mind-set. Because many machines 
are expensive, says Gettman, of National Health Enhancement Systems, exercisers 
figure that hey should work out exclusively and continuously. Wrong approach, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't buy a stepper and say, 'I'm going to do this every day for the next 12 
months." You won't. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, design a seasonal program planned around the home equipment and other 
activities. For instance, he says, he uses the stepper in the winter but 
abandons it each summer for walking and other outdoor exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 Even motivated home exercisers can become slugs.  
</P>
<P>
 "Boredom is the result of a person feeling they could do more, but there is 
not an opportunity in the environment for other skills to be put to use," says 
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a University of Chicago psychology professor and an 
expert on boredom who has abandoned his cross-country ski machine in favor of 
walks and hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 The feeling some people get while riding a stationary bike at home, he says, 
is similar to the restlessness that can strike while waiting in line or 
traveling by bus. "You begin to feel anxious and you want out of the 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting a new piece of high-tech equipment might help: Life Fitness 
Exertainment System teams a Lifecycle with Super Nintendo and lets exercisers 
play as they pedal. To be unveiled in June, it's expected to cost less than 
$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 On the lower end, there's the $129 Computer Athlete, which connects an 
arcade-style computer game to an exercise bike or other piece of equipment. One 
software program allows exercisers to compete with other joggers, says CEO 
Dwight Eberhart. 
</P>
<P>
 Another solution, Csikszentmihalyi says, "is to do something in your mind 
different than just entertaining yourself. That could include planning work, a 
party, vacation. It takes practice, because usually we do these things on 
paper." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a disassociator," Gettman says. "I can't think about the exercise; it's 
too painful." So when walking or stepping, he problem-solves and thinks about 
other things. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are secrets from that exclusive club of successful home exercisers 
who have learned through trial and error how to make themselves stay faithful. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Delatorre, 39, works 50 hours a week as a Beverly Hills physical 
therapist and lives in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have time for the gym," he says. Instead, he works out in a corner of 
the living room where a Universal gym is set up. He bench presses and does 
pull-downs and leg extensions. He's kept it up at least twice a week for four 
years, supplementing it with workouts on a stationary bike and outside cycling 
when he can. 
</P>
<P>
 Christina McMillan has four kids and, one would presume, little time to 
exercise. But nearly every day, the 28-year-old Canyon Country resident heads 
for her garage, where she keeps a weight-training station that uses rubber-band 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do a little each day, and then put in 40-minute sessions twice a week," she 
says. In between sets, she tends to the laundry. 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Einnehmer is strict with herself: No chocolate unless she works out. 
When the 34-year-old Sherman Oaks television executive gets home, one of the 
first things she sees is her exercise equipment: A $7 Rubbermaid stool (in lieu 
of the more expensive exercise step, which can cost $50 and up), two exercise 
videotapes, a variety of dumbbells and ankle weights. She works out at least 
every other day for a full hour. "I know every word she's going to say (on the 
tape)." But she persists. The urge for chocolate is that strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Even home exercisers who have pooped out don't always give up hope, their 
guilt tempered by possibility and the dawn of a new day. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Jacobs, the NordicTrack owner from Burbank, feel guilty? 
</P>
<P>
 "Terribly," says Jacobs, who stopped working out because of an illness in her 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 Does she plan to get back on the program? 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course." 
</P>
<P>
 When? 
</P>
<P>
 "Tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 After all, she says, "Shorts season is coming."

LAUGH LINES: OBJECTIONS? UH, THIS ANGRY MOB HAS A FEW

<P>
 The people, who have just plain had it up to here, have herded all the lawyers 
together and begin now to attack them with really sharp toothpicks, poking them 
mercilessly on their sweaty heads and causing much discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
 The mob puts the toothpicks away and commences yanking with gusto on the 
lawyers' nose hairs, making them yelp. Then the crowd produces biting fire ants 
and. . . . Oops. Sorry. Just a recurring little dream. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have something to do with divorce lawyers -- and who could dismiss 
their contributions to society? -- particularly the one who demanded 13 years 
ago that I give my refrigerator to the woman who left me for a proctologist. 
(Trust me: You can't make something like that up.) 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, maybe one day my dream might be real. (Anyone got any plans for, say, 
next Thursday?) 
</P>
<P>
 But until then, there is a group called Victims of Treacherous Lawyers, which 
recently convened its first meeting in Lorraine Fons' living room in Colorado 
Springs. Fons had worried that the crowd might spill over into her dining room. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims of Treacherous Lawyers? I'd have worried the crowd might spill over 
into Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 As its first order of business, the group asked for names of lawyers in two 
categories: competent and incompetent. Competent got two entries, but one was 
quickly scratched when Dan Wiley said he had personal knowledge that the guy is 
a weasel. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all weasels," shouted 87-year-old Paul Lanton. 
</P>
<P>
 The feeding frenzy had begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanton and others arrived with a feeling for lawyers that can only be compared 
to that deep admiration the guy with the bucket and shovel feels toward the 
parading elephants. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, the anger was broken by humor. Lawyer jokes. But there's no need 
to retell any of them, no need to encourage that type of cheap, juvenile. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Well, OK, perhaps just one: 
</P>
<P>
 Why are a lawyer and a sperm alike? Both have about a one-in-a-million chance 
of becoming a human being.  
</P>
<P>
 Leading the attack was Wiley, a man so infuriated with his lawyer that he 
complained to the Colorado State Bar Assn., which agreed that -- and we're 
paraphrasing here -- he would have been better represented by the Amazing 
Vernon, Circus Llama-Boy. 
</P>
<P>
 But what really makes Wiley's armpit hair braid itself is that the bar told 
him that no record of the admonition of the attorney would be made public. And, 
if Wiley even mentioned it to anyone, he would be in contempt of court; it's 
like, you know, a secret. 
</P>
<P>
 So, say you are about to hire a lawyer. The guy has been disciplined 312 times 
for incompetence and 17 more times for putting thumb tacks on his client's 
courtroom chair.

 Drop dead. The American Bar Assn.'s official explanation for this great 
secrecy? "To maintain the integrity of the legal profession."

 "I'll tell you about lawyers," barks 72-year-old Betty from somewhere deep in 
Fons' sofa. "They stick together. They take care of each other. You know, like 
gang members."

<P>
 Somehow, the victims keep finding the time to tell lawyer jokes. But there's 
no reason to. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 OK, but this is the last time: 
</P>
<P>
 The devil tells a lawyer he'll give him $20 million, fame and a seat on the 
U.S. Supreme Court in exchange for his soul. The lawyer thinks for a minute.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sounds like a good deal," he says. "So what's the catch?"  
</P>
<P>
 The real darn shame in all this is that lawyers try so hard to dispel the 
stereotypes of their profession. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the Huntington Beach lawyer and his son. Seems their law partnership 
broke up a while back, and the proud dad sued his son.

 Earlier this month, in the hallway of Orange County Superior Court, the two 
attorneys spotted each other, took off their coats and started punching the 
bejeebers out of each other.

 Cool. I had a dream about something like that just the other night.

 Novice Farmer Jones bought 20 pigs at auction, only to learn that all were 
female. So he asked Farmer Brown if he could take his pigs to Brown's farm to 
mate with his male pigs.  
</P>
<P>
 Brown agreed, so Jones loaded the pigs in his truck and took them to frolic 
with Brown's pigs. That evening, Jones picked them up and asked Brown: "How 
will I know they're pregnant?" Brown replied: "If the pigs are grazing tomorrow 
morning -- something pigs never do -- they're pregnant."  
</P>
<P>
 Next morning, Jones saw that the pigs weren't grazing, so he loaded them into 
the truck and took them back to Brown's. When the pigs didn't graze the next 
day, he repeated the procedure.  
</P>
<P>
 Feeling very discouraged the following morning, Jones told his wife: "Honey, I 
don't have the heart to go look. Please tell me what the pigs are doing."  
</P>
<P>
 She looked out the window and said: "Well, they're not grazing. Most of them 
are in the truck and one of them is honking the horn."

 Here's an eye-opener from the medical files: Two British eye doctors have 
reported a case of impaired vision from bungee jumping, "highlighting a 
potential serious complication of this sport."  
</P>
<P>
 Six hours after a jump, a woman had some loss of vision in both eyes. After 
one week, her left eye improved, but vision in the right eye remained poor. 
Within 12 weeks, the right eye had improved but still had not returned to 
normal. 
</P>
<P>
 The thin part of the retina is "particularly susceptible to trauma," the 
doctors noted, and may be damaged during a bungee jump by the sudden rise in 
pressure in the tiny blood vessels within the eyeball.

 Without familiar possessions around me, I can still create my favorite, most

BODY WATCH: 10 COMMANDMENTS FOR HEALTHIER KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN, TIMES HEALTH WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are diapers to change and play dates to arrange. Spills to wipe away and 
fights to break up. 
</P>
<P>
 In the chaos of tending to the little challenges of their children's 
well-being parents can easily lose sight of the big picture: their children's 
overall health. 
</P>
<P>
 How can you make jpassage through early childhood healthy? Here's a blueprint 
for building a better child. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Safeguard your property: 
</P>
<P>
 Accidents -- such as choking, burns, drowning, falls and poisonings -- are the 
leading cause of death in children older than 1, according to the National 
Commission on Children. Take time to search your house, garage and yard for 
hazards. If you need guidance, there are many good books on child-proofing and 
some local companies will do it for a fee. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Provide three squares a day and don't be a warden at mealtime: 
</P>
<P>
 Don't fret if your child is a picky eater. According to the California 
Coalition for Healthy Children, the key is to provide three nutritionally 
balanced meals daily and cut the kids some slack about their culinary 
preferences. 
</P>
<P>
 Children should get to select what foods they want -- and how much they want 
to eat -- from the choices offered. "Although all children need the same 
nutrients to grow and develop, they do not need to eat the same diet," the 
coalition states. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Stick to the immunization schedule: 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of all 2-year-old children are not up to date on their 
immunizations, according to the California Health and Welfare Agency. With so 
many shots now required (several have been added in just the past few years), 
it's a challenge to keep up. But maintaining a schedule can prevent severe 
health consequences -- and lost school time -- for a child who later comes down 
with the measles or whooping cough. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask your pediatrician for a schedule and a card to help you record 
immunizations. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Brush those choppers: 
</P>
<P>
 Children should start brushing their teeth as soon as they are old enough to 
hold the brush. Young children will lack coordination, but have patience and 
advise them to "make noise on their teeth" with the brush, say the authors of 
the Your Children's Wellness Newsletter. Because young children aren't the 
world's most thorough dental hygienists, parents should brush up after them. 
Only a tiny bit of toothpaste is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Promote good hygiene: 
</P>
<P>
 Colds and flu can exhaust parents and make for long, dreary winters for kids 
-- and parents. Infections are inevitable, but colds can be limited by teaching 
children to wash their hands often, especially after using the restroom and 
before eating.  
</P>
<P>
 If possible, keep your young children out of day-care situations where there 
are lots of children and poor hygiene policies. Finally, consider flu shots 
each fall to prevent or reduce the severity of some wintertime infections. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Get regular medical checkups: 
</P>
<P>
 According to the National Commission on Children, nearly 20% of children in 
1990 had no contact with a doctor the previous year. With regular health exams, 
your pediatrician can best monitor your child's growth and development -- and 
you can intervene early and aggressively if there is any hint of a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Limit couch potato-ing: 
</P>
<P>
 Children who watch lots of TV are more likely to be overweight and to 
experiment with drugs and sexual activity; another study shows that kids who 
watch TV news can become angry and depressed over what they see. Limit TV to 
one hour a day or less, monitor the programs and don't let young children watch 
TV news at all. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Encourage a little sweat: 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best gifts you can give your child is appreciation for physical 
activity. Nationwide, 27% of all children are obese, according to a 1993 study 
in the Journal of the American Dietetic Assn.; sedentary lifestyle is a major 
cause. Promote outdoor time by enrolling children in recreational programs. And 
since studies show that children are more likely to exercise if their parents 
do, make regular workouts a family goal. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Keep smoke away: 
</P>
<P>
 Secondhand tobacco smoke is now recognized by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency as a significant health risk. In children, exposure to smoke 
can cause an increase in respiratory illnesses -- such as pneumonia, bronchitis 
and asthma -- as well as ear infections. Moreover, it can contribute over the 
long term to lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Don't be a stranger to compliments: 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing as important to children's self-esteem as being praised by 
their parents, says Douglas Bloch, author of a series of books on parenting, 
including the new "Positive Self-Talk for Children." Make your praise specific 
and unconditional. Point out positive traits often.  
</P>
<P>
 "Such unsolicited comments make a powerful impact on the child," he says. 
"They enhance his self-esteem and create a reservoir of goodwill that can 
sustain your relationship during the difficult periods."

EXERCISING INTEREST; THESE 10 TACTICS CAN HELP YOU FORGET HOW BORING 
STAIRCLIMBING CAN BE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE SCHLOSBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Schlosberg, a former editor at 
Shape magazine, is author of The Ultimate Workout Log: An Exercise Diary and 
Fitness Guide. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's not delude ourselves: If there is an activity more boring than pedaling 
a stationary exercise bike, it has yet to be identified. The same goes for 
exercising on a stairclimber and walking on a treadmill (which, by the way, is 
listed under tedium in Roget's Thesaurus). 
</P>
<P>
 But that's no excuse to abandon exercise. You can use a number of gimmicks to 
divert your attention so that before you know it, your 20 or 30 minutes have 
passed and you're free to head for the refrigerator or couch. Eventually, you 
may actually begin to enjoy the sensations of sweat and fatigue, and exercise 
won't seem like a chore. The Stairmaster will cease to be the stairmonster. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are 10 ways to combat boredom on cardiovascular machines, whether you're 
at home or at the gym. Do a crossword puzzle 
</P>
<P>
 Holding a pen and a magazine isn't as cumbersome as it might sound, 
particularly on a bike or stairclimber. And it's an excellent way to make time 
fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Be sure to choose a puzzle that's not too difficult: There's no reason to tax 
your brain and your body at the same time. Unless you're a whiz with clues such 
as "a mineral resembling feldspar," pass on the New York Times puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
 Dell crossword magazines are great because they contain puzzles for all levels 
and include such clues as "Mary had a little -- -- -- -- ." Cycle in short 
spurts  
</P>
<P>
 To break up the monotony, alternate five- or 10-minute bouts on the 
stairclimber -- or bike or treadmill -- with five minutes of weight training or 
other activity (besides eating). Contrary to popular opinion, it is not written 
-- in the Bible, the California Penal Code or anywhere else -- that to benefit 
from exercise, you must perform an aerobic activity for at least 20 consecutive 
minutes. If your goal is to gain endurance, you'll want to do 20 minutes 
consecutively. But if you're simply aiming to improve your health, that's not 
necessary.  
</P>
<P>
 "The bulk of evidence supports the (notion) that it's the total time spent 
that matters. Whether the time is continuous or broken into multiple bouts is 
really a trivial issue," says Rod Dishman, a professor of exercise science at 
the University of Georgia and an expert in exercise adherence. Read a magazine 
</P>
<P>
 Don't try to impress the guy on the treadmill next to you with the New 
Republic. Chances are, he won't even notice, and then you're stuck with 
articles about peace-keeping operations in Tajikstan.  
</P>
<P>
 Go with magazines such as People that contain stories you can actually finish; 
forget Vanity Fair unless you're planning an all-nighter on the treadmill. 
Fitness magazines are a good bet. They'll validate what you're doing, and the 
articles tend to include lists you can skim, such as "Six Moves to a Better 
Butt Now" and "25 Ways to Stop Craving Chocolate." Watch TV 
</P>
<P>
 If possible, schedule your workout during "Seinfeld," "Roseanne" or other 
shows that'll keep you laughing (and for variety, crank up your intensity 
during the commercials). This isn't the time for "Bassmasters" on the Nashville 
Network -- unless of course, you are eager to learn "strategies for catching 
more fish more often." Think -- but not too hard 
</P>
<P>
 "People tend to have their most creative ideas when they're doing something 
that's repetitive and doesn't involve their mind completely," says Mihaly 
Csikszentmihalyi, a University of Chicago professor who is an expert on 
boredom.  
</P>
<P>
 But don't set out to solve the health care crisis. Instead, use your time to 
ponder more solvable dilemmas, Csikszentmihalyi says, "like how to get your 
boss off your back." He suggests keeping a tape recorder handy in case a flash 
of brilliance comes along. Monitor your heart rate 
</P>
<P>
 The number of times your heart beats per minute during exercise is a great 
indicator of stress on your body. If your heart rate is too high, you need to 
slow down; if it's too low, you should speed up. Some exercise bikes and 
treadmills come with built-in heart-rate monitors. If yours doesn't, you can 
buy a monitor for about $100 or you can take your pulse manually. Ask a trainer 
to help you determine your range of safe heart rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monitoring your heart rate continuously will keep you busy, and it will make 
your workout more effective," says Kevin Smith, a fitness consultant at 
Busybody, an exercise equipment store in West Los Angeles. Make use of the 
machine's gadgetry 
</P>
<P>
 With their flashing dots, beeping arrows, interval programs and plentiful 
feedback, today's high-tech machines have eliminated some of the monotony from 
indoor exercise. Periodically check how many miles you've walked, stairs you've 
climbed or calories you've burned. (Keep in mind that the calorie estimates 
aren't always accurate, and even the best machines can't factor in your 
metabolism. And if you're clenching or leaning on the side railings of your 
stairclimber, you're not burning as many calories as the machine says you are.) 
Talk on the phone or to a friend 
</P>
<P>
 Some people think that if they're able to speak while exercising, they must 
not be doing their body any good. That's not true. "Your breathing should not 
be so labored that you can't carry on a conversation," Dishman says. Listen to 
music 
</P>
<P>
 Rock, rap, pop, country -- go with whatever gets your adrenaline pumping. If 
Vivaldi works for you, so be it. A tape that mixes fast and slow songs can add 
variety to your workout, because your intensity tends to go in sync with the 
music. "The Eagles Greatest Hits" -- with "Life in the Fast Lane" and "Take It 
Easy" -- has a perfect blend. Sing -- to yourself, if you want to retain your 
gym membership 
</P>
<P>
 If all else fails, you can resort to the old time-killing standby, "100 
Bottles of Beer on the Wall." You might want to try this gym adaptation: 
</P>
<P>
 100 bottles of beer on the wall 100 bottles of beer, If I stop exercising and 
go to the mall I won't be able to drink any more beer at all.

RSVP / INTO THE NIGHT: IN THE SPIRIT OF SANTA MARTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a Catholic Eastside hospital receiving a transfusion of secular 
downtown corporate support Friday when the Santa Marta Hospital Foundation held 
a black-tie fund-raiser at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
 The 110-bed acute-care facility in East Los Angeles operated by the Daughters 
of St. Joseph netted more than $250,000 with the help of, among others, Bank of 
America, Arco, Goldman Sachs, Chase Manhattan and Times Mirror Co., parent 
company of the L.A. Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you visit Santa Marta," said Times Mirror Chairman Robert Erburu, who, 
along with his wife, Lois, received the ninth annual Life Spirit Award, "you 
very quickly see that an enormous amount is being done with very little. If 
you're in business, you have to admire that. 
</P>
<P>
 "This hospital is a gem that has to be nurtured," Erburu added. "I really 
don't know what East Los Angeles would do without Santa Marta." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Santa Marta's early nurturing came from former President Richard M. 
Nixon, whose death was announced midway through the evening by hospital 
president Sister Guadalupe Guarneros. In 1968, at the request of the late 
Cardinal James McIntyre, the President-elect was the featured guest at a 
fund-raiser generating a substantial amount of the $10 million needed to build 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, however, the only presidents on hand were from corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 600 supporters in attendance were dinner co-chairs Robin and Peter 
Barker, Gretchen and George Gibbs Jr., Anne and Robert Wycoff, and Thomas 
Decker; plus Lawrence and Rebecca del Santo, Ed Zapanta, Betty Freeman, and 
dinner committee co-chairwomen Dorothy Shea and Patty Burschinger. 
</P>
<P>
 The dinner proceeded briskly with comments by Guarneros, the Rev. Donald 
Merrifield and Joseph Duffy and a performance by the Modernaires backed by the 
Ray Moshay Orchestra and then the award presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people haven't heard of Santa Marta," Lois Erburu said in her 
acceptance. "There's a lot of secrets in this city. Special places with people 
doing wonderful things."

MAKING ENGLISH SPELLING EZER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN HOGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A movement to simplify English spelling has been going on for more than two 
centuries, but nothing major has ever come of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reform efforts have all failed -- partly because English spelling works so 
well, even though it's confounding," says Ronald Macaulay, a Pitzer College 
professor of linguistics."Its strength is that it's written the same -- 
irregularities and all -- all over the English speaking world." Thus, East-end 
Cockney can communicate with South African colonial, Texas oil baron or Hong 
Kong jogger, all of whom may pronounce the same word in different ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Spelling reformists -- whose ranks have included Benjamin Franklin, Noah 
Webster, George Bernard Shaw, Theodore Roosevelt, Charles Darwin, Andrew 
Carnegie and Mark Twain -- call written English everything from "a flawed tool" 
to "the world's most awesome mess." 
</P>
<P>
 It should be simplified, they argue, not only for sanity's sake, but for the 
sake of general literacy among the English-speaking masses. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a sociological point of view, one could argue that the educated class 
has a stake in not backing spelling reform -- to keep the illiterate classes 
illiterate," says Charles Kleber, president of the Detroit-based Better 
Education Thru Simplified Spelling.  
</P>
<P>
 Kleber and other reformists argue that a more logical, more phonetically sound 
English spelling system (for example, hav , thru and tho ) would increase 
literacy and, eventually, reduce school dropout rates, recidivism, unemployment 
and crime. Says Kleber: "The implications are almost unimaginable." MARY ANN

E-MAIL: A LANGUAGE FROM CYBERSPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 B eep.  
</P>
<P>
 The E-mail message arrives in the computer: hi--luvd your last messg/made me 
LOL. Lets get togther over lnch. soon.  
</P>
<P>
 The New Age of Communication could render good spelling obsolete. Electronic 
mail -- computer-generated messages that zip through phone lines to computer 
"mailboxes" all over the world -- tends to emphasize content, not form. 
</P>
<P>
 "E-mail is a more informal use altogether. The message is important, the 
presentation is not," says Dennis Baron, a professor of English and linguistics 
at the University of Illinois, Urbana. "Conventions of correctness are usually 
suspended. What we're seeing is the democratization of communication." 
</P>
<P>
 E-mail message writers don't use letterheads. They don't formally sign their 
names. They don't necessarily capitalize letters. They use shorthand ("LOL" 
means "laugh out loud") and they don't necessarily spell properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ethos of E-mail is that you say what you have to say in the moment. The 
point is speed and naturalness, not correctness," says John Seabrook, a New 
Yorker magazine writer whose recent profile of Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates 
included selections from E-mail between the two men. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a big discussion in the copy department here about whether to keep 
Gates' misspellings in the piece," Seabrook says. "We felt we ought to keep 
them -- which is a pretty big deal at the New Yorker -- because it was more in 
the spirit of what E-mail is about. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the point is that you're not committing anything to paper," he says. 
"Somehow, what you write doesn't have the same kind of real existence, so 
things like spelling don't really matter." MARY ANN HOGAN

STATEWIDE HEALTH CARE PLAN EXPECTED ON BALLOT IN FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS SHUIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Public interest groups backed by an alliance of physicians said Monday they 
will turn in enough signatures today for a November ballot initiative calling 
for a comprehensive California health-care system that would remove private 
insurance companies from coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed "single-payer" plan, to be financed by taxes and patterned after 
a system used in Canada, would provide medical benefits to all state residents, 
proponents said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a million signatures have been collected -- well over the 677,000 
needed to qualify the measure for the Nov. 8 general election, sponsors said. 
The signatures will be turned in to voter registrars in all California counties 
for verification. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are for this. People are for health care reform. They want to see the 
doctor of their choice," said Dana Hohn, in charge of volunteer 
signature-gathering in Los Angeles County for Californians for Health Security, 
the group that organized the petition drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance industry is expected to put up the strongest opposition to the 
proposed initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "It guarantees people insurance, but it does so at a tremendous cost in terms 
both of tax dollars and giving up control of a very intimate part of their 
lives to a government agency," Alan Katz, a San Fernando Valley-based 
legislative chair of the National Assn. of Health Underwriters, said of the 
single-payer plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the groups backing the three-month petition drive are the California 
Council of Churches, numerous labor unions, the California Nurses Assn., the 
California Physicians Alliance, the Gray Panthers senior-citizens' group, the 
California Teachers Assn. and several consumer organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters hope the strong volunteer effort will help swing national health 
care debate to the single-payer concept, which so far has received no support 
from President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The President made the proposed California initiative possible, however, by 
putting in his national health reform plan a provision allowing states to adopt 
their own health-insurance programs, including the single-payer type. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would require key legal waivers by Congress and the California 
Legislature before it could be implemented. The single-payer plan, which would 
cost an estimated $105 billion a year when fully implemented in 1996, would 
replace Medi-Cal and Medicare, as well as the private insurance system. It 
would extend coverage to the estimated 6 million Californians now without 
health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it would be financed by tax increases, supporters said many 
Californians would see no increase in net expenditures on health care because 
they would no longer have to pay health insurance premiums, or put out their 
own money for prescription drugs, long-term care or other medical bills not 
covered by many insurance programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, Californians would receive a comprehensive package of health 
benefits, including mental health, long-term care, and prescription drug 
coverage, regardless of health or employment status. The state would negotiate 
doctors' fees and hospital rates and would allow consumers to choose 
physicians, hospitals or health maintenance organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 To finance the plan, every California employer would be required to pay a 4.4% 
to 8.9% payroll tax, depending on the number of employees. Sponsors contend 
that employers would pay about the same as they now pay for employee health 
insurance premiums; employers who now provide no health insurance for employees 
would pay more. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also would boost the state's income tax another 2.5% to 5%, but 
supporters say the increase would be offset by elimination of insurance 
premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative also would add a $1-a-pack tax to the price of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 To oversee the program, the system calls for a health commissioner to be 
elected statewide. The health commissioner's office would be similar to the 
office of the state insurance commissioner established under Proposition 103, 
the insurance reform initiative aimed at automobile insurance and approved by 
voters in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Just two years ago, California voters overwhelmingly rejected Proposition 166, 
a universal health insurance measure sponsored by the California Medical Assn., 
a physicians' group. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of the single-payer initiative, many of whom opposed Proposition 166 
on the grounds that it would have allowed insurance companies to maintain their 
grip on the health system, believe Californians may be ready to support a 
universal health plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Kowalick, a nurse and Oakland-based statewide coordinator of the 
initiative campaign, said: "This plan covers everybody better for less cost 
than any other plan that is being circulated. And it keeps intact people's 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the proposed initiative said they spent about $780,000 on the 
signature drive, although many names were collected by volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did over 100 house parties, where we took in contributions from $25 to 
$500," Kowalick said. The California Physicians Alliance raised $150,000 and 
collected 10,000 signatures, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A national poll conducted by The Times in April found that most Americans 
prefer to keep health insurance in non-government control, but the results were 
inconclusive because it was unclear how well such a system was understood by 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz, the National Assn. of Health Underwriters legislative chairman, 
predicted that initiative sponsors will unfairly "paint the insurance companies 
as the bad guys and argue that eliminating them is going to solve all the 
problems" in the health-care system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Californians would have no choice but to take the plan that the government 
provides," he added. "I don't think (voters) will go for that."

AQMD UNVEILS REVAMPED PLAN TO WIPE OUT SMOG; POLLUTION: FOCUS IS ON CREDITS, 
INCENTIVES FOR INDUSTRY. THE 15-YEAR PROGRAM ALSO TARGETS TRAFFIC EMISSIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Reflecting a clean-air strategy billed as more business-friendly and less 
far-fetched than previous efforts, the Southland's air-quality agency Monday 
unveiled its newest plan to return blue skies to the nation's smoggiest region 
by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Coast Air Quality Management District's plan -- its third in five 
years -- contains 89 steps proposed for the next 15 years, consisting of 41 
that target pollution from industries, 17 aimed at cars and trucks, and 10 for 
vehicles such as trains and airliners, and 21 measures to improve traffic 
patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 About one-third of the ideas are new, with an unprecedented focus on credits 
and other market incentives to encourage industries to find their own ways to 
clean up smog. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency says the plan, if successfully implemented, would meet federal 
health standards for every major air pollutant in the region, despite a 
projected 40% population increase. About 75% of all smog-causing emissions 
would be eliminated -- 5% each year. "We think that Congress and the 
Legislature (have) every reason to be optimistic that we can meet the goals 
they have set for us," said Barry Wallerstein, AQMD deputy executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency believes that its new air quality management plan is more practical 
and flexible than the earlier versions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the items in this plan most people would find to be very realistic. 
You can't please everyone, but I think most people will believe we have a lot 
more realism in it than perhaps we've had in the past," said Henry Wedaa, a 
Yorba Linda councilman who is chairman of the AQMD board. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next three months, businesses, environmentalists, civic leaders and 
others in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties will comb 
through the three-foot-thick draft, with the debate likely to focus on a key 
point: Where does most of the pain fall? The AQMD is facing pressure to fairly 
balance the economic burden among big industries and motorists, small 
businesses and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 The AQMD's governing board is scheduled to vote on the program in July after a 
series of public hearings. Under federal law, the AQMD and the state must have 
an approved clean-air plan by November. 
</P>
<P>
 Because this is the AQMD's third version of a 20-year clean-air plan, everyone 
involved is wondering about the chance of success this time. AQMD officials 
hope the latest plan will replace a sweeping series of rules that the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency proposed in February under a court order to 
clean up the air in the Los Angeles Basin. At the time, the EPA challenged the 
AQMD and the state to come up with their own smog-control options. 
</P>
<P>
 To improve the chances of success, some innovative transportation ideas were 
dropped from the plan at the last minute, including imposing pollution fees on 
motorists caught speeding and raising the legal driving age to 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Those ideas were proposed by the Southern California Assn. of Governments, but 
Wallerstein called them political lightning rods that were far-fetched and 
would distract from more achievable measures. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic framework of the plan is familiar. Several dozen rules to be adopted 
by the AQMD or state Air Resources Board would require companies to use the 
most advanced technology to cut emissions from factories, small businesses, 
cars and fuels. 
</P>
<P>
 But the thrust of how to regulate industry shifts dramatically. Market 
incentives -- just a footnote in the 1991 plan -- now are a cornerstone of the 
AQMD's strategy. The plan contains a series of credits, rebates and fees to 
encourage cleaner practices in place of traditional regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also sets aggressive goals for use of advanced technology in cars. By 
2010, 78% of passenger cars would be fueled by methanol or other low-emission 
fuels, while 22% would run on electricity or fuel cells. Enforcing such 
mandates falls under the jurisdiction of the state ARB, which is facing 
unprecedented pressure from the auto industry to scale back its existing rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Also included are a trio of fees that are certain to raise howls of protest 
from motorists: car registration fees based on miles driven, new taxes on fuel 
and freeway tollbooths that would charge motorists fees during high-congestion 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles attorney Robert Wyman, who represents oil and aerospace companies, 
said industries will look especially closely at whether the proposals are tough 
enough in getting high-polluting vehicles and solo commuters off the roads. 
Wyman said he hopes to see some "innovative transportation controls" to help 
ease the impact on local industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the debate about sharing the smog burden focuses on a new state 
finding that the volume of pollution emitted by cars has been dramatically 
underestimated. The Air Resources Board estimates cars emit 60% more 
hydrocarbons and twice as much carbon monoxide as previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Hirsch, the Southern California Gas Co.'s senior external affairs 
manager, said the AQMD is "playing a shell game" by avoiding the new emissions 
numbers in its plan to underplay the role cars have in creating smog. He said 
more painful changes for commuters are needed than those contained in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be hard to do. It will take some dramatic policies to reduce those 
emissions," Hirsch said. "It may mean changes in the ways we commute to work. 
It may mean . . . no-drive days. It's more than reducing tailpipe emissions. 
The idea is to stop the driving." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the plan pertaining to industry is modeled after RECLAIM, the AQMD's 
newly launched "smog market," which sets pollution limits for industries and 
allows them to buy, sell and trade credits, a strategy popular with big 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for expanding the pollution-trading program in 1998 to 1,200 
companies that emit hydrocarbons -- petroleum-based fumes that are a main 
component of smog. Included would be major aerospace firms and other companies 
that use large amounts of paints and solvents. 
</P>
<P>
 Under attack by the Legislature and business groups that want to dismantle the 
agency, the AQMD of 1994 is more focused on consensus-building than the agency 
that created its original clean-air plan in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Broadbent, the AQMD's director of planning, said the new plan "provides a 
lot more flexibility" for local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned we can provide industry the target and they will provide the 
ingenuity to get there," Broadbent said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (plan) is more business-friendly," Wedaa said. "We have been stressing 
that we should treat the businesses as our customers and we want to have -- as 
much as possible -- reasonably happy customers." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most critical components of the plan -- an analysis of the cost and 
social impact -- will not be released until late May. In the past, the AQMD 
estimated that achieving clean air in the Southland will cost $3 billion to $6 
billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though it has no jurisdiction over interstate sources of pollution such 
as planes, trains and ships, the AQMD plan contains aggressive proposals to 
target them. Adopting and enforcing those measures, however, would be left in 
the hands of the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposals to target planes, trains and ships -- sources of smog that have 
never been regulated before -- are extremely unpopular. Area businesses worry 
they will make the Los Angeles region less competitive than the rest of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think it's fair to leave sources uncontrolled," Wallerstein said. 
"If it's fair game for passenger cars, it's certainly fair game for dirty 
diesel trains." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the other new proposed measures in the plan include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Use of "smart" cars and highways that electronically ensure traffic flows 
smoothly by selecting the best route. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tree plantings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Credits or rebates for households and businesses that install 
energy-efficient, low-emitting equipment such as water heaters. 
</P>
<P>
 * Control of dust from unpaved roads and parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 * Emission reductions from construction activities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use of advanced technologies in shuttle transit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Building of infrastructure -- such as plugs in garages and recharge stations 
-- to support electric cars. A meeting Monday in Van Nuys to explain the plan 
to the public was lightly attended, but similar sessions continue throughout 
the four counties today through next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The AQMD will hold its next public meeting today at 9:30 a.m. at the Mission 
Inn in Riverside and at 2 p.m. at the Red Lion in Ontario. The largest sessions 
are expected to be at 10 a.m. Thursday at the Davidson Conference Center in Los 
Angeles and at 7 p.m Wednesday at the Newport Beach Marriott.

S. AFRICA BLASTS KILL 12 ON ELECTION EVE; VIOLENCE: A 220-POUND BOMB RIPS A 
TAXI STAND IN NATION'S DEADLIEST WAVE OF RIGHT-WING TERRORISM. TROOPS ARE 
MOBILIZED TO ENSURE SAFETY AT POLLING PLACES.

<P>
 A 220-pound bomb ripped through a crowded taxi stand used by blacks in this 
conservative city Monday, killing 10. Two more people died later in a 
restaurant blast in Pretoria as the deadliest wave of right-wing terrorism in 
the nation's history hit South Africa on the eve of all-race elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks, the most recent of more than a dozen that have killed 21 and 
injured almost 200 in the past two days, appeared to be part of a campaign by 
white extremists to discourage South Africans from voting in the three-day 
elections that will bring blacks into government for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Political leaders, seeking to reassure worried South Africans, announced 
Monday the biggest peacetime military call-up in the country's history to 
ensure that the 9,000 polling stations will be safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides army troops, 100,000 police officers, twice the number that was 
originally planned, will be on guard at polling booths beginning today. 
</P>
<P>
 "A group of desperate people, small handfuls of radicals, have declared war on 
the rest of this society," President Frederik W. de Klerk said. "We will not 
rest until they have been tracked down, convicted and punished, as they 
deserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our contingency plans for the elections are in place," he said. "While 
incidents such as these obviously constitute a risk, I want to assure the 
public that we will do our best to assure they can vote safely." 
</P>
<P>
 It was difficult to tell how many of the expected 20 million voters might be 
deterred from casting ballots by the resurgence of terrorist attacks, 
especially if more innocent people are killed in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 But many South Africans said the attacks, part of the biggest bombing campaign 
since the then-banned African National Congress was waging guerrilla war on the 
white-minority government in the 1980s, have made them more determined to make 
the elections a success. 
</P>
<P>
 Johann Kriegler, head of the Independent Electoral Commission, promised Monday 
that the elections will go ahead, "bombs or no bombs." The voting begins today 
with elderly and disabled South Africans casting ballots at 500 special polling 
stations. The entire country goes to the polls Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kriegler said Monday's killings were tragic, he added, "We have come 
light years in four years, and we will not be deterred by minor incidents." 
</P>
<P>
 A white suspect was arrested and questioned Monday in the bombings in 
Germiston and in Johannesburg a day earlier, police said. They declined to 
specify the suspect's political affiliation, but Gen. Johan van der Merwe, 
commissioner of police, promised that "a breakthrough is imminent." 
</P>
<P>
 Police offered a $300,000 reward, the largest in this country's history, for 
information leading to the arrest and conviction of the Germiston bomber. 
Authorities said the Johannesburg car bomb, which killed nine and injured more 
than 100, and the larger Germiston bomb were probably prepared by the same 
person, someone with considerable experience with explosives. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-wing leaders insisted Monday that their organizations were not 
responsible for the bombings. But a caller to an Afrikaans-language newspaper 
late Monday claimed that his right-wing group was responsible for the Germiston 
blast and warned that it "would be a picnic compared with what is to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Political analysts said all the attacks carried the signature of militant 
rightists, who have vowed to boycott the elections and demand an autonomous 
homeland for the Afrikaner descendants of the first white settlers. "What is 
clear is that there is a new element in right-wing terrorism," said Wim Booyse, 
a political consultant in Pretoria and an expert on the white right. "And these 
blasts have risen to a level that the country has never seen before." 
</P>
<P>
 Booyse said the attacks were probably part of a last-ditch campaign by one or 
more of the shadowy, highly trained groups on the right, which have been silent 
for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Sunday, a dozen bombs have exploded at polling stations, government 
offices and other sites, although there have been no serious injuries in those 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 ANC President Nelson Mandela visited victims of the Johannesburg blast Monday. 
Speaking to reporters later, he said he is convinced that the nation's police 
commanders want to end the violence. "I hope the government acts in a way to 
remove the impression that it is a government of weakness, unable to rise to 
the challenge that is posed by madmen who are killing innocent people," he 
added. 
</P>

 In Pretoria, the explosive device was tossed into a crowded restaurant 
catering mostly to blacks shortly after 8 p.m. Monday, killing two and 
seriously injuring at least six, police said. Witnesses said the bomb was 
thrown from a passing car carrying two young white men. 
</P>
<P>
 The bomb in Germiston, a white industrial city about 10 miles southeast of 
Johannesburg, was planted in a trailer parked amid taxi vans near downtown. It 
exploded at 8:45 a.m., shattering windows in a four-block-square area, tossing 
parts of cars and bodies onto roofs of nearby buildings and destroying 10 
minibus taxis. A grocery store building also was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bomb was to scare away the voters," said Izzy Naigi, a spokesman for the 
Congress of South African Trade Unions, an ANC-aligned labor association with 
local offices near the scene. "We were expecting something like this, and we 
expect more to come." 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion occurred on a city street where black taxi drivers collect 
passengers and fix their vehicles; the dead included drivers, passengers and 
clerks in the store. Whites in the area had complained in recent months that 
the illegal taxi stand had increased the crime rate in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The blast heavily damaged the adjacent, two-story Good Hope Center, an 
apartment building run by a charity for poor and elderly whites. Many of the 80 
people there were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd never heard anything that loud in my life," said Piet Bothes, 50, who 
runs the center. "It's hard to believe that human beings can do things like 
this. All I can say is they weren't Christians, because Christians couldn't do 
anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Cape Town, the white-dominated Parliament met for the last time 
Monday to amend the constitution to recognize the Zulu monarchy and allow 
Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party to participate in the 
voting. Buthelezi called off his election boycott last week. His decision has 
eased tensions in Natal province, where supporters of Buthelezi and Mandela 
have been battling for a decade, leaving thousands dead.

<P>
 She hails a cab, asks to be driven to the nearest cliff and decides it is time 
to die. 
</P>
<P>
 At the coroner's office, they lay her young, slender body on a slab in a metal 
chamber. The place smells. It's cold. 
</P>
<P>
 A week goes by and nobody comes to claim her. A month. Two. A year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they are sympathetic enough at the coroner's office, they decide one 
day that they need her space. A crematory is called. For $425, which is paid by 
the county on her behalf, her ashes are placed in a cardboard box. The box is 
deposited on a rent-a-boat, motored out to sea off Dana Point, and in a 
ceremony that is as lonely as was her death, a man casts her remains overboard 
and tells her to rest in peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever she is. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last decade, at least 33 people have died in Orange County who have 
met, or will meet, similar fates. Other counties have more unclaimed bodies. 
But many of Orange County's Jane and John Does are striking because they do not 
appear to be transients who lived solitary, anonymous lives. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, 26 people who died in Los Angeles County in 1993 have yet to be 
identified. But Scott Carrier from the Los Angeles County coroner's office said 
investigators suspect that nearly all the county's Jane and John Does are 
illegal immigrants whose relatives and friends fear coming forward, or 
transients who long ago unplugged themselves from the world around them. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason Orange County has always been a place where people from other 
parts of the country come to die," said Joseph Luckey, a veteran Orange County 
coroner's investigator who has been identifying the dead since his tour as a 
mortuary sergeant in the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Does who lie unclaimed inside the beige coroner's building on 
Santa Ana Avenue were people who appeared to have money and connections to the 
outside world. They had extensive dental work. They wore brand-name clothes. 
They had bus tickets, maps, motel keys, scraps of paper with phone numbers or 
some other clue that suggested the beginning and middle of their lives wasn't 
nearly as empty as the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: a man who spent his last day at Disneyland, an elderly woman who 
enjoyed crossword puzzles and a woman who wore a ring made of human hair. 
</P>
<P>
 They died and no one noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Such tantalizingly promising clues and a hatred for unsolved riddles drive 
coroner's investigators, most of whom see it as their mission to bring a 
vestige of dignity to the Does' deaths. All told, about a dozen coroner's 
investigators in Orange County must divide their time between the identifiable 
dead and the Does. If they can spare the storage space, they will keep a Doe 
for a year and beyond before sending the body for cremation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody should have to die that way," said Cullen Ellingburgh, a longtime 
investigator with the Orange County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellingburgh seems to be a man who isn't easily offended any more by what 
people do to each other. But he regards it a cruel form of irony that the fates 
would allow someone to die anonymously. Heaping insult onto injury for him and 
others in his line of work is the niggling taunt that there is somebody out 
there who knows what they don't. 
</P>
<P>
 "A person doesn't just walk around on this earth for 20 or 30 years and not 
run into somebody along the way who wouldn't want to know that they're dead," 
Ellingburgh said. "Everybody has a mother, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 For those who try to identify the Does, the presence of the unclaimed in the 
bowels of the coroner's office provides further evidence of how harsh and 
impersonal society can be. Amid the nauseating odor of formaldehyde and the 
clank of metal crypts, the soulless stares are a reminder that life can be an 
imperfect stage where one's exit can be as unheralded as one's entrance is 
applauded. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does get discouraging," allowed Cherry Goodman, a soft-spoken senior 
investigator who measures her words and emotions with care. Until recently, she 
had taken on the Doe list as her personal project. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're mysteries," she said. "We have one case where all we have of the 
person is six teeth. And of the six teeth, only one has identifiable 
characteristics." 
</P>
<P>
 It seems improbable that -- in a society so addicted to computers and forms in 
triplicate -- a person can die without a name. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also a disturbing testament, Ellingburgh said, to a culture that is 
increasingly alienated. Gone are the times when families kept intact and in 
touch, when there were enough safety nets to catch those who fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, the county coroner has investigated seven Does, the victims of car 
accidents, violent crimes, suicides or causes unknown. Several were too young 
to have died at all, Ellingburgh said, let alone to have died abandoned. In 
their quest to learn the Does' identities, investigators employ every means 
known to forensic science. Sometimes, they resort to such not-so-scientific 
means as consulting psychics. They have been known to chase long-shot leads on 
decade-old cases, in part, because, though the faces of death are all too 
familiar to them, it bothers them to bury someone without a name. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellingburgh, who can recite intimate details from years-old cases, still 
refers to one Jane Doe, a freckle-faced teen-ager who killed herself in 1987, 
as "my girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Luckey affixed a sketch of one of his Does to his tape dispenser. He still 
wonders: Was there something he missed? Another phone call he should have made? 
</P>
<P>
 Another investigator, Maureen Albrecht, still doesn't understand why a woman 
killed on Mother's Day, 1989, has yet to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's strange, but in many of these cases you do wonder why somebody doesn't 
come forward," said Ellingburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes Ellingburgh wonders if maybe the Does' spirits won't be able to rest 
until their relatives are told of their fate. He believes in God, he said, and 
would like to think the Does are destined for a better place. But any place is 
better than where they've been. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Jane Doe 87-4457EL and John Doe 92-6012LY had known what was to become of 
them after their deaths, maybe things would have been different. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 20, 1987, a strawberry-blond teen-ager stacked her belongings neatly 
at the top of a 150-foot cliff near Dana Point Harbor, pointed her size-6 shoes 
west and stepped off. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 14, 1992, a man in his 20s or 30s apparently treated himself to a day 
at Disneyland, then hurled himself off the roof of the 13-story Inn at the Park 
hotel in Anaheim. His silty, cream-colored remains reside in a cardboard box on 
a special shelf at Lesneski's Mortuary in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 The two cases baffled coroner's officials who felt the bodies would not remain 
Does for long. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should have been missed," Ellingburgh, the deputy supervisor, said. 
"They were young and looked cared-for." 
</P>
<P>
 John Doe, clean-cut, short-haired and baby-faced, might have passed for an 
accountant on vacation. Of average height with a good build, he wore cut-off 
jeans. Stuffed in his pockets: two Greyhound bus tickets dated Oct. 13, 1992, 
one from Las Vegas to Los Angeles, another from Los Angeles to Anaheim. Also: 
the stub from a one-day passport to Disneyland, "the happiest place on earth," 
the stub said. It was dated the day of his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Examining his teeth -- one of the first steps in a Doe investigation -- 
coroner's officials were encouraged by what they saw: seven fillings and a 
crown. If he had been a transient, he probably would not have had such dental 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 They dispatched copies of his fingerprints to the state Department of Justice, 
the FBI and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, hoping for a match. They 
sent Teletypes to police departments in the western United States, urging them 
to check missing persons' lists. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of an anthropologist, they estimated his age based on the size 
and shape of his bones. 
</P>
<P>
 They called Greyhound, but found out he paid cash for his tickets so there was 
no record of his name. They searched the hotel registry, but he never checked 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Tang of Anaheim and her husband may have been the last people to 
speak to John Doe. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour and 20 minutes before his death, they strolled through a park near 
their home and saw him sitting on a bench in a gazebo. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just wanted to talk," Tang remembered recently. "He seemed educated; he 
wasn't a bum. He was so despondent. I said to my husband, 'God, I hope he 
doesn't go and do something.' " 
</P>
<P>
 His last words to the Tangs: "God bless you." 
</P>
<P>
 Hers to him: "You, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tang, "You'd think that somebody would be missing him somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think the same about the young woman who took her life near Dana Point 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4 in the morning on Sept. 20, 1987, she called a cab from the Hampton Inn 
in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 She asked the cabby to drive her as far as $18 would take her. He let her out 
at the intersection of Cove Road and Scenic Drive, where she handed him a $10 
bill and eight ones, and walked to the nearest cliff. Standing at the ledge, 
she would have seen nothing -- there was no moon that night -- and heard only 
the wet smack of the Pacific against the rocks below. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ellingburgh, who handled the case, "She was still alive for some time at 
the bottom of the cliff, because she had made angel wings with her arms in the 
sand, you know, like children do in the snow." 
</P>
<P>
 But there were no angels at the base of the Dana Point Harbor cliff that 
morning, and none would appear later. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a single lead would ever come in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The inch-thick file that belongs to another Jane Doe, 90-1853LY, weighs more 
than any other, but that has only added to the frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 Stepping onto Pacific Coast Highway on April Fools' Day, 1990, she was struck 
first by a Mazda MX-6, then a Lincoln Continental. She died instantly. She was 
18 or 19, maybe 20. 
</P>
<P>
 She carried no identification and no credit cards. But what she did have 
seemed unique: a ring made of human hair, a smooth black stone, and a motel key 
inscribed with No. 218. Most promising: When a sketch of her was published in 
local newspapers, several Huntington Beach residents said they had spoken with 
her. Her family lived in Virginia, she'd told them. 
</P>
<P>
 Coroner's investigators immediately contacted Virginia newspapers. They 
dispatched descriptions and sketches nationwide. They bombarded missing 
children's organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Responses numbered into the hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
 One man was convinced he used to work with Jane Doe at a Kentucky Fried 
Chicken outlet. Her name was "Charlotte" and the likenesses were uncanny: She 
wore a ring of human hair and at one time she had had four front teeth knocked 
loose by a boyfriend. But the real Charlotte turned up alive. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of possible leads went on: She's "Maggie" from the trailer park. No. 
She's "Linda" from church. No. She's "Jackie," said the Missing Children's 
Clearinghouse. No again. 
</P>
<P>
 As investigators followed up each lead, six months slipped by. A year. 
Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't realize how many people out there are unaccounted for until you go 
through something like this," said Luckey, the chief investigator on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 He even went so far as to quiz his kids' high school friends to see if they 
knew anything about Jane Doe. He hung a copy of her sketch on his refrigerator 
at home until his family insisted he take it down. At work, he kept another 
sketch of her on his tape dispenser. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had pictures of the wife and kids on my desk, and next to them, Jane Doe," 
said Luckey, a father of four who said he couldn't help but think of his own 
daughter while working the case. "I wanted to keep her face fresh in my mind 
because we do become very busy around here." 
</P>
<P>
 When a psychic came forward and suggested Jane Doe was from Florida, Luckey 
appealed to 18 Florida newspapers to run an article about her on the second 
anniversary of her death. Some did. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, her identity is still an unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 "That really hurts me when you say that," Monique Colyar said recently when 
told that Jane Doe was still unidentified. Colyar took her in for a night just 
days before the accident. "I thought that long ago somebody would have claimed 
her. . . . Maybe if I had listened to her more closely." 
</P>
<P>
 She might also have been identified if investigators could have worked on the 
case exclusively, investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
 But death comes to 15,000 Orange County residents a year, 8,000 of whom are 
investigated by the coroner's office. That means 22 coroner's cases a day, 
every day, and so time must be rationed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first got into this business I thought that when you got one of these 
cases you worked on it until you identified the person," said Ellingburgh. "But 
that's not realistic in this day and age." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The people who deal with Jane and John Does can hardly believe such a 
phenomenon exists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know families break up and there are all kinds of circumstances out there," 
said Ellingburgh. "But I can't imagine the same thing happening in my family. 
Can you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes people aren't identified because they don't want to be. A man in 
Orange County once signed his suicide note with a false name, but investigators 
traced the gun he used. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes geography is to blame. The coroner's office once had a John Doe 
until investigators discovered his belt buckle had only been given to people 
who worked on Alaskan oil rigs. When an article about the man was published in 
Alaskan newspapers, someone recognized him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes survivors don't want to come forward. They've had a falling out with 
the person who died. Or they assume someone else will identify the body. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, the remains of eight of the latest Does are tucked away on a 
shelf at Lesneski's Mortuary, including the man who spent his last day at 
Disneyland. After 18 months in the coroner's freezer, he was cremated March 10. 
</P>
<P>
 All eight eventually will be taken three miles off Dana Point and buried at 
sea. Before each burial, Edward Lesneski or his son, Mark, will recite a 
prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether it's a John Doe or a John Rockefeller," said Edward Lesneski, 
"they're people. They deserve some light at the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other metropolitan areas, which dispose of unclaimed bodies after a few 
months, sometimes weeks, morticians in Orange County hold the Does' ashes for 
at least two years in hopes that somebody will come forward. The law doesn't 
require it; they do it by choice. The finality of burial merits the delay, 
Ellingburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the Does' ashes have been scattered, all earthly traces of them will be 
wiped out, he said. As if they had never existed.

JAPANESE SOCIALISTS BOLT, IMPERIL COALITION RULE; POLITICS: HATA, NEW PREMIER, 
LOSES MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT. FUTURE OF HIS GOVERNMENT IS IN DOUBT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twelve hours after electing former Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as prime 
minister in Parliament, Japan's fractious ruling coalition collapsed early this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama announced at 1:22 a.m. that his party was 
bolting the coalition and would no longer be bound by a policy agreement 
hammered out just last Friday after seven days of bitter debate that had pushed 
the coalition to the brink of a split. 
</P>
<P>
 The move stripped Hata's coalition of its majorities in both the lower and 
upper houses of Parliament and left up in the air whether the coalition can 
continue to rule. 
</P>
<P>
 It also threw into doubt Japan's ability to fulfill a promise to the United 
States to produce a sweeping program of economic policies in June to 
substantially reduce its $141-billion global trade surplus, including a 
$60-billion imbalance with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hata won 274 votes in the lower house election for prime minister -- 
a solid majority in the 511-seat chamber -- a walkout by all 74 Socialists 
would reduce the coalition's strength to 200 seats. 
</P>
<P>
 That is fewer than the 206 seats held by the opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) that was ousted last summer after 38 years in power. 
</P>
<P>
 If the 15-seat New Party Harbinger -- which has already announced that it will 
not join the new Cabinet -- sides with the Socialists, the blow could be even 
bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no clear forecast of what might lie ahead. Among the possible 
scenarios: 
</P>
<P>
 * The coalition could retain control if there is a split in the Socialist 
Party -- whose rank-and-file members must still discuss their leaders' abrupt 
move -- and if there are defections from the opposition Liberal Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 * The coalition might try to run a minority government by negotiating with 
parts of the opposition, including the Socialists, for support on every bill, 
including the budget; this would be exceptionally risky, though, because the 
coalition would have to hope that no party would submit a no-confidence motion. 
</P>
<P>
 * The coalition-led government might dissolve the lower house and call a 
general election in hopes of settling the political chaos. Or there might be an 
alliance of convenience between the Socialists and the Liberal Democrats. Both 
of these steps, however, could threaten already-enacted political reforms -- 
cornerstones of eight months of labors by the coalition. The reforms will take 
effect only after Parliament enacts a bill to fix boundaries of new single-seat 
districts; any election before then would be held under the old system, with 
multi-seat districts and voters electing an average of four lawmakers from each 
constituency. 
</P>
<P>
 Announcing the Socialists' decision to quit the coalition, Murayama condemned 
their partners, including Hata's Renewal Party, for committing "an act of 
betrayal" by secretly forming a new "parliamentary bargaining group" called 
Kaishin (Reformation) and for "changing the framework of the coalition" by 
admitting two mini-parties that had not been in the coalition under former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
</P>
<P>
 These acts, he said, were committed "without any consultations at all" with 
the Socialists and destroyed "the faith and trust" on which any coalition 
depends. "From the standpoint of running the coalition democratically, we 
cannot forgive these acts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Socialist leader noted that the coalition earlier had agreed to freeze 
moves to form any "bargaining group" -- a group that operates in Parliament as 
a single party but whose two or more parties field candidates separately in 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Socialists, who have insisted on maintaining their own identity within the 
coalition, want to see Japan retain a multi-party political system. In 
contrast, Ichiro Ozawa, deputy leader of Hata's party and chief strategist 
under Hosokawa's coalition, advocates a two-party system. Formation of the new 
alliance in Parliament was widely viewed as a step in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama indirectly accused Ozawa of masterminding the alliance in order to 
isolate the Socialists. 
</P>
<P>
 The Socialist chief said he had called Hata to inform him of the decision made 
only by himself and the party's other two top officials. Hata asked him to 
"wait, wait," but he said he replied, "There is no room for any more 
discussions." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the Socialists' central committee formally approved the leaders' 
decision unanimously. In a separate meeting, the party's potential defectors -- 
who are banded together in a conservative group called the "Democrats" -- also 
backed the move. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata said he will appeal to the Socialists to reverse their decision. If he 
fails, the remaining coalition partners will form a Cabinet by themselves, 
party leaders decided today, nine hours after disbanding in the middle of the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Japan's constitution, Hata will not officially assume power as prime 
minister until a ceremony is held in the presence of Emperor Akihito. Until 
then, Hosokawa and his Cabinet ministers, who resigned Monday, formally retain 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberal Democrat President Yohei Kono condemned Ozawa's "highhanded" methods 
of decision-making and said he will appeal to both the Socialists and the New 
Party Harbinger to form an agreement on "how to operate Parliament." The 
statement was regarded as a veiled invitation to form a new coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata failed to explain why he had not called a meeting of coalition party 
chiefs Monday afternoon, as tentatively scheduled, to discuss the formation of 
a new Cabinet. Murayama angrily charged that he had waited four hours and 
learned only minutes before the meeting was finally to begin that the 
Reformation group already had been officially registered as a new parliamentary 
group with 130 lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although apparently planned in advance, formation of Reformation came without 
any public warning. 
</P>
<P>
 Keigo Ouchi -- chairman of the middle-of-the-road Democratic Socialist Party, 
which earlier had aligned itself with the Socialists -- fired the first shot. 
Without informing the Socialists, he telephoned other parties in the coalition 
to ask them to align themselves in the single bargaining group. Ouchi later 
said such a move would strengthen Hata's base of support. 
</P>
<P>
 With blitzkrieg speed, Hata's Renewal Party, Hosokawa's Japan New Party, the 
Democratic Socialists and the two splinter parties leaped on the bandwagon. The 
Buddhist-backed Clean Government Party and a band of five recent defectors from 
the LDP also were reported leaning toward joining the group. But even with 
them, the group would fall far short of a majority. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the Socialists learned of the moves, Ouchi's proposal had taken on 
the air of an ultimatum to "join or quit" the coalition.

CLINTON REJECTS CASINO TAX HIKE FOR WELFARE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 President Clinton has ruled out tax increases to pay for his welfare reform 
plan, and has approved a narrower $9.5-billion program focused on his core 
campaign promise of requiring work after two years on the rolls, senior 
Administration officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision means that the Administration will disappoint liberals by 
proposing only modest expansions in child-care programs for the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
 But it will allow Clinton to avoid the difficult fight over taxing gambling 
revenues, which would have been required to pay for the larger plan, which had 
an estimated cost of $13 billion to $16 billion over four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are focused entirely on the core of what he promised during the campaign," 
said one official. 
</P>
<P>
 By rejecting the casino tax, Clinton has assured that the plan will be funded 
only with budget cuts. After earlier criticism that proposed cuts focused too 
heavily on the poor, the Administration is now also targeting what one official 
called "welfare for the wealthy," including some farm support payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's decision will not affect the welfare plan's central elements: 
efforts to increase collection of child support payments and a requirement that 
welfare recipients work after two years on the rolls, either in private-sector 
jobs or in public service jobs if no private jobs are available. Under the plan 
Clinton supports, the work requirement will be phased in, beginning with 
recipients born after 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 But the decision to reject taxes means the Administration will cut back on 
other elements of the plan, including state demonstrations of some reform 
experiments and a planned expansion of child-care assistance for the working 
poor. The plan will still provide child care for welfare recipients undertaking 
training or work. 
</P>
<P>
 There was clearly division in the ranks over the decision. Walter Broadnax, 
the deputy secretary of health and human services, said: "It is going to be a 
less robust plan, and we're going to be losing a part that is clearly important 
if we're going to stablize the working poor and keep them from going on 
welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 Broadnax said he hoped more funding would be found from some other source, 
saying the measure is "extremely important" to welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is expected to submit its long-delayed welfare reform 
proposal to Congress some time next month. Only a handful of significant 
decisions remains, including whether to permit states to deny additional 
benefits to women who have children while already on the welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of expanded child care immediately charged that rolling back those 
provisions could undermine the overall reform effort. "If correct, leaving 
child care out sets poor women up for a fall," said Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). 
"What we heard again and again in our hearings is that women go out into the 
private sector, begin to make headway, and if child care is not there, they 
slip back into welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few weeks ago, in a final report prepared for the President, the task 
force had argued that expanding child-care assistance was a critical element of 
welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key missing component for making work pay is affordable, accessible child 
care," the task force wrote. "In order for families, especially single-parent 
families, to be able to work or prepare themselves for work, they need 
dependable care for their children." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, some welfare reform advocates have argued recently that the 
best way to pass the plan is to strip it down to its essentials. 
</P>
<P>
 The rejection of the casino tax represents a triumph for those inside the 
Administration who felt that Congress would resist any taxes to fund welfare 
reform, particularly one targeted at the powerful gambling industry. But it is 
bound to disappoint liberals who would have preferred the Administration impose 
a tax rather than cut other programs for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the casino lobby represents a narrow interest, it is extremely 
politically powerful in particular states," said Robert Greenstein, executive 
director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think-tank 
based in Washington. "By contrast, (the poor) don't make campaign contributions 
and the people who argue on their behalf tend to be church groups and religious 
organizations that don't have the raw political muscle that well-heeled 
special-interest groups that make large contributions have." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration hopes to mute such criticism by expanding the targets of 
the budget cuts to programs that benefit the wealthy. In recent weeks, 
Administration officials have been combing through a report by Robert J. 
Shapiro, vice president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist 
Democratic think-tank, identifying subsidies for the affluent and corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two subsidies Shapiro fingered are likely to be included in the final 
welfare reform funding package, officials said. One is a proposal to cut back 
on farm subsidy payments to wealthy part-time farmers who receive more than 
$100,000 annually in non-farm income; another would deny favorable tax 
treatment to certain kinds of annuities. But officials said the Administration 
also is committed to pressing ahead with its most controversial budget cut: A 
plan to extend the period before legal immigrants can become eligible for 
Supplemental Security Income benefits, which aid the disabled, indigent and the 
elderly who do not qualify for Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton plan will still double child-care spending over the next five 
years, adding another $1.5 billion in total. But it is a substantial cutback 
from the broader plan, which would have increased child care for the working 
poor by $3.5 billion over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the rejection of casino taxes will also compel the Administration 
to scale back several reform experiments some officials had hoped to include in 
the final plan. Sources said that the Administration will roll back a planned 
test of child support assurance -- a program to guarantee a minimum child 
support payment to all single parents. The program is favored by Health and 
Human Services Assistant Secretary David T. Ellwood, a co-chairman of the task 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 Also to be reduced are experiments on letting welfare recipients keep more 
part-time earnings and incentives for recipients to accumulate assets toward a 
college education or starting a business. And rather than requiring states to 
expand welfare assistance to two-parent families, the plan now would leave them 
the option of doing so.

BITTER LEGACY THE LOSER AS VOTERS HEAD FOR POLLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Against all odds, South Africans of all races will begin to go to the polls 
today to liberate themselves from their own bitter history. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than three centuries of white rule, four decades of apartheid and 
four years of bloodshed, the overwhelming black majority will cast ballots for 
the first time, today through Thursday, to elect a government that has pledged 
to repudiate racism and seek social and economic justice through multi-party 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 It is one of history's most unusual revolutions: An elite white minority is 
surrendering political power to the impoverished black majority it oppressed 
with Kafkaesque rules of racial classification, rigid segregation and brutal 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 Those blacks now will be able to determine their own future and rule their own 
land. Today marks the end of the last white-ruled autocracy in Africa and the 
birth of the world's newest democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 At exactly one minute before midnight tonight, South Africa's 66-year-old 
flag, the tricolor standard of the old white-ruled regime, will be officially 
lowered for the last time. The old national anthem, the Afrikaans-language "Die 
Stem" ("The Voice"), will be played. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, at one minute past the hour, South Africa's new flag, the six-color hope 
of a new nation, will be hoisted at nine new provincial capitals and at up to 
6,000 government buildings, courts, police stations, embassies and ships in 
navy and merchant fleets. 
</P>
<P>
 The black liberation anthem, "Nikosi Sikelel iAfrika" ("God Bless Africa") 
will echo over the land as the new constitution and charter of rights come into 
effect to officially guarantee basic rights and freedoms to all South Africans 
for the first time since Europeans landed in Cape Town in 1652. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the coming weeks and months, power and authority will pass inexorably 
from rich to poor, from leafy suburb to sprawling township, from 5 million 
whites to 30 million blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Expectations are high, but so are the fears. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa has a climate of intolerance and a culture of violence that won't 
disappear when votes are counted. After generations in which nonwhites were 
denied decent housing, schools or jobs, the post-apartheid upheaval to a new 
form of government, a new legal system, new schools and other institutions may 
be as difficult as the anti-apartheid struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 The new government will inherit a heavy debt, a bloated civil service and 
desperate demands for housing, education and health care. "One thing we've 
learned is elections are the easiest part of a new democracy," Madeleine 
Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, warned during a recent visit 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 The task of holding this volatile new nation together almost certainly will 
fall on the patriarch of the liberation movement, a man who has never been 
allowed to vote in his 75 years of trial and triumph -- Nelson Rolihlahla 
Mandela. Under the new constitution, which creates posts for the opposition, 
one of Mandela's top deputies is likely to be the last white president, 
Frederik W. de Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
 A beaming Mandela told supporters last week that his goal was in sight "after 
27 years in jail, 20 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
 A wave of last-minute terror bombings, the death rattle of white supremacy, 
marred the eve of the elections. It was the inevitable coda, perhaps, to a 
four-year transition from apartheid to democracy that saw almost 15,000 people, 
mostly black, killed by fighting for the spoils of white rule. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bombs, blamed so far on ultra-right-wing whites, have added a pall of 
gloom to the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 One bomb exploded outside a popular black restaurant Monday night in Pretoria, 
killing two people. Earlier, a huge car bomb devastated a busy taxi stand in 
Germiston, a Johannesburg suburb. Ten were killed and 40 injured. That followed 
a huge car bomb Sunday in Johannesburg that killed nine and wounded 98. Smaller 
bombs also exploded overnight at several empty polling stations and election 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Johann Kriegler, head of the Independent Electoral Commission, said 
Monday that the bombings only "reinforced the determination" of the 22.7 
million eligible voters -- including up to 18 million first-time black voters 
-- to cast their ballots. "The real message now is joy," Kriegler said. "We've 
come light years in four years, and we'll not be deterred by minor incidents." 
</P>
<P>
 Kriegler and his commission -- backed by more than 200,000 election workers 
and monitors, plus about 5,000 international observers -- must certify whether 
the poll is free and fair. The commission has banned journalists from entering 
polling or counting stations, and Kriegler said Monday that it was "arrogant" 
for reporters to claim a right to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the first day of voting, is expected to draw fewer than 1 million 
"special voters." Polls will be set up in hospitals, prisons and nursing and 
retirement homes. Pregnant women and blind and disabled voters will be able to 
cast ballots at special polling stations. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africans around the world also can vote today. Polls have been set up in 
80 countries, from Argentina to Zambia. An estimated 100,000 South Africans 
will cast ballots at 24 polling places in 16 U.S. cities, including Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela is scheduled to cast his vote at 7:30 Wednesday morning in a 
battle-scarred Zulu township outside Durban in Natal province. The rest of the 
nation will vote all day Wednesday and Thursday, flocking to 9,000 schools, 
clinics, courthouses, post offices and other makeshift polling stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Schlemmer, a political scientist and pollster with Johannesburg's 
Human Sciences Research Council, said reams of data from 22,000 interviews in 
the last year have proved "one thing" about the hopes and expectations of the 
newly enfranchised electorate: 
</P>
<P>
 "People expect to be treated with dignity; their status as a human being, as a 
South African, is non-negotiable," he said. "Quite frankly, I feel this 
election is more about honor and status than about houses and jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1 million spoiled ballots are expected from voters who mistakenly 
mark their X in the wrong place or otherwise invalidate their franchise. The 
official results won't be announced for at least 48 hours after polls close, 
although unofficial tallies will be available. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the euphoria of the moment, the election is likely to reaffirm past 
divisions. Polls show that only a tiny fraction of whites will vote for the ANC 
and that only a tiny fraction of blacks will vote for De Klerk's National 
Party. Instead, whites, Indians and mixed-race Colored voters -- all minorities 
now -- are likely to join a broad coalition against the black-led ANC. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an election about liberating minorities," Schlemmer said. "It's 
an election about liberating the majority."

STUDY CASTS MOVIE POPCORN AS HEALTH VILLAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL HOUSTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hamburgers, hot dogs -- and now popcorn. What's next on the killjoy list of 
yummies deemed dangerous to your health? 
</P>
<P>
 The popcorn served at most movie theaters can help give you heart disease, 
according to a study released Monday by the Center for Science in the Public 
Interest, a nonprofit consumer group. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because artery-clogging coconut oil high in saturated fat is used to 
pop roughly 70% of the corn being pushed across refreshment counters, the study 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a small offering of popcorn without "butter" topping contains an entire 
day's recommended allowance of saturated fat, a major cause of heart disease, 
according to the report. A medium-sized "buttered" popcorn at a typical theater 
contains "more fat than a bacon-and-eggs breakfast, a Big Mac-with-fries lunch 
and a steak dinner with all the trimmings combined," the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Theater popcorn ought to be the 'Snow White' of snack foods, but it's been 
turned into 'Godzilla' by being popped in highly saturated coconut oil," said 
center Executive Director Michael Jacobson. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven heart-disease authorities joined the center in urging the heads of 
major theater chains to switch to air-popped corn, a lightly oiled-and-salted 
product that Jacobson said is delicious and contains 70% less fat than corn 
popped in coconut oil. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've known for 30 years that coconut oil raises blood cholesterol more than 
butterfat, beef tallow, lard or any other fat or oil," said Dr. Stephen Havas 
of the University of Maryland Medical School. "It's unbelievable that theaters 
are still popping popcorn in this stuff when heart disease is the No. 1 killer 
in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 The survey covered popcorn sold at United Artists, AMC, Cineplex Odeon, Loew's 
and other theaters in the San Francisco, Chicago and Washington areas. A 
laboratory in Texas did the nutritional analyses, which included calorie 
content. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, at Cineplex Odeon theaters, a small serving (about seven cups) of 
popcorn cooked in coconut oil and served without butter contains 398 calories, 
the study found. At AMC, a medium portion (11 cups) with butter has 910 
calories, and at United Artists, a large size (about 16 cups) with butter 
contains 1,221 calories. 
</P>
<P>
 Theater industry executives said that, while they take the study seriously, 
their popcorn needs to be put in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average person goes to the movies only five or six times a year, and when 
they settle in with popcorn, candy and a soft drink, they know they're not on 
the Pritikin regime -- they're relaxing," said Bill Kartozian, president of the 
National Assn. of Theatre Owners in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also," he continued, "a lot of people who go to the show don't have butter 
added to their popcorn, and a lot of people share, so the portions referred to 
(by the study) should be divided by some number." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Cineplex Odeon told the Associated Press that popcorn is "not 
a health issue, it's a small indulgence." He said that coconut oil provides the 
taste and aroma craved by customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people ask us why they can't get their home popcorn to taste as good as 
theater popcorn. The answer is the coconut oil," said Howard Lichtman, 
executive vice president of marketing for the Toronto-based chain of 235 U.S. 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found that some theaters are showing signs of health consciousness. 
A multiplex theater in northern Virginia advertised that it was "now popping 
with canola oil, low in saturated fats, no cholesterol." 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble is, the study discovered, many theaters are using partially 
hydrogenated canola shortening, which contains four times the fat of canola oil 
. How Fat Content Varies 
</P>
<P>
 Most movie theaters make popcorn in coconut oil; a few use canola shortening. 
Some stores sell air-popped popcorn. A look at a typical "small" bag of popcorn

CRITICS CHALLENGE STUDY THAT FOUND WELFARE CHEATING RATE OF 62%; AID: ONLY SIX 
OF 135 ALLEGED FRAUD CASES WERE PROSECUTED. THE ORANGE COUNTY RESEARCH HAS BEEN 
WIDELY CITED TO JUSTIFY SPENDING MILLIONS ON CATCHING CHEATERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last November, the Orange County district attorney's office made a startling 
announcement: A six-month study of a sample of 216 family welfare cases found 
that recipients had committed fraud in a whopping 62% of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The finding struck a nerve in a state already wary of welfare cheats. Since 
the study was released, lawmakers from Los Angeles to Sacramento have pointed 
repeatedly to Orange County's fraud rate in pushing for expensive fraud 
detection programs, and Gov. Pete Wilson cited the 62% figure in advancing his 
own plans for welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is growing criticism over just how valid the study of Aid to 
Families With Dependent Children recipients is. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, prosecutors have filed criminal charges in only six of the cases for 
alleged overpayments totaling $33,529 -- a fraction of the $168,000 spent by 
the California Department of Social Services to conduct the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics maintain that the tiny number of prosecutions only shows that 
investigators grossly exaggerated the fraud rate in the first place, failing to 
take into account that people sometimes make mistakes when dealing with a 
complex bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "For them to throw that 62% number out the way they have is intellectually 
dishonest," insisted Casey McKeever, an attorney who specializes in welfare 
reform issues in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, more than one-quarter of the 135 welfare recipients whom Orange County 
officials accused of welfare fraud in November are back on assistance today. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, officials in Sacramento estimate, the fraud rate for all AFDC cases 
is only about 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the district attorney and the Orange County Social Services 
Agency, which collaborated on the project, defend their handling of the study. 
</P>
<P>
 They blame the small numbers of prosecutions on the difficulty of obtaining 
the evidence needed to win convictions in welfare fraud cases, combined with a 
backlog in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 But they assert that their "aggressive" probe was responsible for another 89 
welfare cheats in the study agreeing to voluntarily withdraw from the rolls 
rather than face criminal prosecution, thus saving $1.2 million in taxpayer 
dollars over the next 33 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Two examples cited by investigators who worked on the study show the wide 
range of alleged abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, investigators said, a woman failed to report her husband's 
earnings as a fruit picker for three months in 1992. At the time, she was 
receiving a $326-per-month AFDC grant for one of her two children, who is a 
U.S. citizen. The total overpayment: $652. 
</P>
<P>
 She was charged with a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 In another instance, a woman had reportedly withheld information that her 
husband was employed and living in the same house with her and their two 
children. As a result, she received $13,939 in AFDC and food stamps, 
investigators said. Prosecutors have filed felony fraud charges against the 
woman, who was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics have suggested that state and county welfare officials targeted 
illegal immigrants as a main sample in the study because they suspected they 
might find a higher incidence of fraud among that group. 
</P>
<P>
 The study focused on a subset within the AFDC caseload that is 68% Latino -- 
half of whom were either undocumented or in the process of obtaining legal 
status. Latinos in general make up 38% of all aid recipients. Meanwhile, 
despite the fact that the authors of the study cautioned others against using 
their findings to make generalizations about the AFDC population, their 
research has been widely cited by lawmakers statewide to help justify spending 
millions of dollars on anti-fraud detection projects, including fingerprinting 
of AFDC and General Relief recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 However, analysts say the so-called Child-Only Fraud Pilot Project has obvious 
statistical flaws, including the method that investigators used to calculate 
the 62% fraud rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators stated in the report that they had rooted out 135 cases of 
fraud. Based on the original computer-generated sample of 500, the fraud rate 
would have been calculated at 27%. Instead, investigators threw out more than 
half the cases for a variety of reasons, then figured the 62% rate based on the 
number they actually probed. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates for the poor have been especially critical of the low number of 
prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
 They also rejected the conclusion that the 89 people who voluntarily asked to 
be taken off aid during the investigation must have been welfare cheats, as 
suggested in the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials determined that fraud was present if there were any "substantial 
changes to case eligibility because of the investigation." These changes might 
include a family's failure to supply the necessary information to 
investigators, a change in the makeup of the household, a grant reduction, an 
overpayment or the discontinuation of aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Field, chief of welfare fraud investigations for the district attorney, 
maintains that in all 135 cases, the people were in fact guilty of welfare 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you that in every single one of the 135 cases, it was not human 
error but intent to defraud," Field said. " 
</P>
<P>
 The study states that every dollar spent on fraud investigation results in 
$7.29 in taxpayer savings. 
</P>
<P>
 However, according to the legislative analyst's office in Sacramento, a 
nonpartisan research agency that serves state legislators, the study overstates 
the amount of future savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Lucia, who analyzed the study recently at the request of a legislator 
whom he declined to identify, said investigators inflated the average length of 
time that recipients remain on aid and used higher, outdated average grant 
levels to determine savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the apparent inconsistencies, Lucia said, the Orange County study 
figured prominently in a legislative subcommittee's decision earlier this month 
to recommend that the Assembly approve $330,000 for similar fraud studies in 
Alameda and Fresno counties.

VICTIM REFUSES TO TESTIFY IN '3 STRIKES' CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was billed as San Francisco's first "three strikes, you're out" case, but a 
victim cried foul and wouldn't testify about a crime that could have sent a car 
burglar to prison for life. 
</P>
<P>
 "You ever heard of Mothers Against Drunk Driving? Well, how about victims 
against 'three strikes'?" Joan Miller, 71, said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller risked being sent to jail for contempt of court by refusing to testify 
against Donald Rae Brown, who was charged with breaking into her car last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 But the case was resolved, without her being called to the stand, when Brown 
agreed with prosecutors Friday on a guilty plea and a four-year prison 
sentence, twice the usual term for second-degree burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, 45, has numerous criminal convictions, most of them more than 20 years 
old, said Assistant Dist. Atty. Richard Hechler. If the prosecutor had been 
able to prove that two prior convictions were for residential burglary, any 
felony -- including the burglary of Miller's car -- would have been a third 
strike requiring a prison sentence of 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Since records have been obtained so far on only one residential burglary 
conviction, Hechler said, his office agreed to accept the guilty plea to a 
second strike when the victim refused to testify. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentencing law, signed March 7 by Gov. Pete Wilson, classifies a variety 
of violent or serious felonies, including residential burglary, as strikes. A 
second conviction requires a doubling of the usual sentence. For someone with 
two strikes, any new felony conviction requires a sentence of 25 years to life 
unless prosecutors decide not to seek such a sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Though a courtroom confrontation was avoided, Miller made her position clear. 
Before Brown appeared Friday in Municipal Court, Miller asked a San Francisco 
Daily Journal reporter, "Are you familiar with the history of nonviolent civil 
disobedience?"

TRAGEDY'S VOICE; VIETNAMESE BOY WILL TELL CONGRESS OF BOAT PEOPLE'S PLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ngo Van Ha is a 16-year-old orphan who speaks little English. But today he 
will testify before a congressional subcommittee, and what he has to say may 
influence national policy on the estimated 50,000 Vietnamese boat people still 
languishing in refugee camps in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Local refugee rights activists say the frail teen-ager, barely five feet tall, 
personalizes what they describe as a continuing tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He presents a human dimension to the tragedy of the boat people," said Van 
Tran of the Westminster chapter of Legal Assistance for Vietnamese Asylum 
Seekers. "If a pale child can speak before a powerful committee, it will send a 
message to the authorities running the camps." 
</P>
<P>
 Ha arrived in the United States April 12 after spending four years at a Hong 
Kong refugee camp, where he became a celebrity of sorts by surviving repeated 
attempts by the Hong Kong government and the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees to send him back to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Ha was orphaned at 10, when his parents died in a bus accident in Vietnam. He 
lived with relatives until he was 12, then fled Vietnam by boat with 35 other 
people and wound up in the Hong Kong refugee camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the High Commissioner for Refugees attempted to send Ha back to 
Vietnam, but his relatives there did not want him because they could not afford 
to raise him. 
</P>
<P>
 The relatives who did want him -- a distant aunt and uncle in San Gabriel -- 
were not allowed to bring him to the United States until a barrage of publicity 
in the Hong Kong media and efforts by lawyers from refugee rights groups forced 
the high commissioner to grant him refugee status. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Ha wants to be the voice of those left behind in the refugee camps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to speak about the conditions in the refugee camps," he said through 
an interpreter before leaving for Washington. "I want to repay those who have 
helped and took care of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Ha is one of 13 Indochinese refugees who will appear before the House 
subcommittee on East Asia and Pacific affairs, which is investigating cases 
involving Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong and Hmong refugees in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional leaders want to find out if there is an "institutional bias" in 
the way certain cases, especially those involving children, are being handled 
by U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Refugee advocates said they hope that Ha's testimony will also help stop the 
forced repatriation of refugees to Vietnam and speed up the screening process 
for those seeking asylum in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an immigration issue but a human rights issue," said Lan Nguyen, 
an attorney for the Vietnamese asylum-seekers group. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen said that at a time of strong anti-immigrant sentiments, it is hard to 
overcome negative public perception about refugees. And although the group he 
represents is advocating the resettlement of refugees, it is not suggesting 
that they all be resettled in the United States, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the public has to be educated about the abuse of the refugees at the 
camps, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many refugees are summarily denied refugee status, Nguyen said. In an effort 
to empty the camps, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and the host 
countries have removed health clinics and other services, triggering protests 
from refugees that sometimes end in violence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Southeast Asian Resource Action Center in Washington, which 
provides medical and other services to refugees, reported that Hong Kong police 
used tear gas to break up a group of nearly 2,000 protesting refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Werner Blatter, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees bureau director for 
Asia and Oceania, met with Vietnamese community leaders this year in several 
U.S. cities. In a Jan. 14 meeting with Orange County Vietnamese leaders, he 
said the problems of violence and medical care in the camps will be addressed.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR; CANDIDATES SEE NO. 2 POST AS STEP 
UP POLITICAL LADDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Based on recent history, the office of California lieutenant governor may seem 
like a political dead end, but not to two ambitious Republican state lawmakers 
facing off in their party's June 7 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Cathie Wright of Simi Valley and Assemblyman Stan Statham of Oak Run see 
the contest as their chance to move up the political ladder and give the 
state's No. 2 office a higher profile. 
</P>
<P>
 But whoever wins might not have long to savor victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican nominee can expect a tough fight in the November general 
election against Democrat Gray Davis, who also sees the office as a coveted 
prize. The upwardly mobile, two-term state controller already has amassed a 
whopping $1.9 million in campaign funds and faces only token opposition in his 
party primary. 
</P>
<P>
 On paper, the lieutenant governor holds limited authority to act in the 
governor's absence. Among the job's duties are chairing the Economic 
Development Commission, serving on other panels such as the University of 
California Board of Regents, and the largely ceremonial and seldom exercised 
role of presiding over the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates are attempting to succeed Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, 
who has sought to upgrade the office over the past 12 years only to be 
overshadowed by two successive Republican chief executives. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy, once the powerful Speaker of the state Assembly, said the office can 
be influential but it takes a concerted effort. He said he was forced to work 
"20 times harder to do something in this office than I did as Speaker." 
</P>
<P>
 The office has only rarely been a launching pad for higher elective office. In 
the past 50 years, only Goodwin J. Knight managed to step up to the governor's 
chair and that was only because Gov. Earl Warren was appointed in 1953 to the 
U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Republicans and Democrat Davis maintain that they will give the office 
renewed clout. Davis said he wants to help revive the state's economy. Statham 
sees himself as a super-legislator. Wright's aim, in part, is to be the eyes 
and ears of Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Field Poll showed Wright leading Statham, 23% to 13%, with 64% of 
Republicans contacted saying they were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright enjoys an early fund-raising lead, with $77,000 in the bank compared to 
Statham's $2,300, according to campaign reports. She also won the endorsement 
of the strongly conservative California Republican Assembly. Statham has served 
in the Assembly since 1976 and faces term limits that prohibit him from seeking 
reelection in 1994. Wright, first elected to the lower house in 1980, won a 
four-year Senate term in 1992, allowing her to seek higher office this year 
without relinquishing her seat. 
</P>
<P>
 They both have exhibited a willingness to speak out and split with their GOP 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, with Assembly Speaker Willie Brown's leadership in jeopardy, Wright 
abstained rather than join most of her Republican colleagues in voting to oust 
the liberal San Francisco Democrat. That same year Statham, too, broke ranks 
with the GOP, accusing then-Assembly Republican leader Ross Johnson of trying 
to "blackmail" him and two other GOP members into opposing Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are differences, especially on women's health issues. Wright, 64, a 
sharp-tongued former insurance underwriter, is an unapologetic opponent of 
abortion while Statham, a former TV anchorman, favors abortion rights but 
opposes public financing of abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 To woo women voters, Statham, 55, trumpets his support for a 1993 law that 
raised cigarette taxes by 2 cents a pack to pay for increased breast cancer 
research and prevention. Wright opposed the law, saying she was against new 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 During a Senate Judiciary Committee debate this year on another anti-smoking 
proposal, Wright vigorously denied a charge, leveled by a witness, that her 
views are influenced by tobacco company campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright denied it, but then seemed to suggest the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now," Wright admonished the witness, "when you want to start donating funds 
to people here on this (committee) because they either vote or don't vote for 
(what) you believe in, then you have a right to complain." 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview, Wright said she had not meant to say that witnesses 
need to contribute money to have their voices heard in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright drew attention outside her San Fernando Valley-Ventura County area 
district once before. Five years ago, she became mired in allegations that she 
improperly sought to use her clout to help her daughter retain her driver's 
license despite being given 27 traffic tickets. However, a district attorney's 
investigation determined there were no clear-cut criminal violations that could 
be prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 Statham, who represents the rural, northeastern corner of the state, is best 
known for championing a controversial drive to allow voters to decide whether 
California should be broken into three states. 
</P>
<P>
 But he seems to be soft-pedaling what started out as the centerpiece of his 
campaign, at least in Southern California. Now, Statham says, voters should be 
presented the breakup option only if he fails in his effort to overhaul state 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright said she is adamantly opposed to breaking up the state, saying Statham 
fails to tell voters, especially in rural counties, how costly that would be. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson is not publicly playing favorites. Dan Schnur, a Wilson 
spokesman, said either GOP rival would bring special qualities to the ticket: 
Wright as a vote-getter among women and Statham for his appeal to rural voters.

ANTI-ASIAN HATE CRIMES STUDIED; RACE RELATIONS: LEGAL GROUP SAYS SUCH INCIDENTS 
ARE UNDERREPORTED NATIONALLY. DOZENS OF CASES ARE LISTED IN SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA. 
</P>

 Hate crimes against Asian Americans are committed daily in the United States, 
but law enforcement officials and prosecutors often fail to investigate such 
incidents adequately, according to a study released Monday by the National 
Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common locations of the hate crimes were residences, where people 
were assaulted or found their homes defaced with racial epithets. 
</P>
<P>
 "A frightening statistic is that we're most vulnerable in our own homes," said 
Kathy Imahara, an attorney with the Asian Pacific American Legal Center of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first comprehensive study of its kind, the Washington-based consortium 
said that at least 30 Asian Americans died in 1993 as a result of crimes in 
which racial motivation was suspected or proved. Hundreds more suffered from 
assaults, vandalism and other crimes aimed at them because of their ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, 11 cases of racially motivated assault, 11 of 
vandalism and 10 of harassment, threats or hate mail were recorded by the 
consortium, which includes organizations such as Imahara's group. Fourteen 
homicides of Asian Americans in the Los Angeles area are suspected, but not 
proved, to have been racially motivated, according to the consortium. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, among the more than 50 cases of gun-related crimes against 
Korean merchants in Los Angeles in 1993, 18 cases of assault and homicide are 
suspected to have involved possible racial motivation, according to the Asian 
Pacific American Legal Center. 
</P>
<P>
 These statistics represent just a small proportion of total hate crimes 
against Asian Americans, because language and cultural barriers and poor 
record-keeping by law enforcement agencies mean that such incidents are 
severely underreported, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, when Asian Americans have reported hate crimes, police have 
failed to investigate, Imahara said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's . . . unacceptable and outrageous that these tragic incidents don't 
receive the attention they ought to," said Stewart Kwoh, executive director of 
the Asian Pacific American Legal Center. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times poll of Southern California conducted last August found 21% of the 
area's Asian residents reported that they had been victims of a hate crime in 
Southern California. That compares with 12% of whites, 14% of blacks and 16% of 
Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Hate crimes in 1993 cited in the report include: 
</P>
<P>
 * A five-foot sign left in the back yard of a Vietnamese American family in El 
Monte, with a gun strapped to it and a message that read: "Kill all Chineaz 
Gooks." 
</P>
<P>
 * Swastikas found burned into the carpets of a Korean American family, and 
other symbols and epithets found on walls. 
</P>
<P>
 * The slaying of Sam Nang Nhem, a 21-year-old Cambodian American beaten to 
death by a white youth or youths in Fall River, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 The consortium called on law enforcement officials to hire more bilingual 
officers and to work with community groups and churches to encourage more 
reporting of hate crimes, especially by recent immigrants. It demanded that 
more jurisdictions begin compiling statistics about hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwoh urged citizens to report crimes they suspect of being racially motivated 
to police, prosecutors, the Asian Pacific American Legal Center at (213) 
748-2022, the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission at (213) 974-7611, 
or the Los Angeles City Human Relations Commission at (213) 485-4495.CRIME

WILSON TO SUE U.S. ON INMATE IMMIGRANTS; GOVERNMENT: THE ACTION WILL ALSO SEEK

PLANNED SERIES OF LEGAL ACTIONS ON IMMIGRANT ISSUES.

 Saying California no longer can afford to wait for Congress to act, Gov. Pete 
Wilson announced Monday that he will file suit to force the federal government 
to take responsibility for illegal immigrants in the state's prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said the lawsuit will be the first of a series of legal actions focused 
on the cost to California taxpayers of providing services to illegal 
immigrants, including education and emergency health care. 
</P>
<P>
 The first lawsuit, Wilson said, will demand $377 million as reimbursement for 
the cost this year of imprisoning 16,700 illegal immigrants who have been 
convicted of felonies in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also will seek to require the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service to take custody of these convicts when they are released at the end of 
their sentences and, in the case of Mexican citizens, to deport them deep into 
their country rather than at the border, which is now commonly the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, in a speech to a Los Angeles business group, said he hopes that 
forcing the federal government to pay for the services will prompt Washington 
to more aggressively guard the border. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the federal government were held accountable, they would quickly discover 
that the cost of ignoring the real and explosively growing problem of illegal 
immigration is far greater than the cost of fixing it," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican chief executive gave few details of the lawsuit, which is 
expected to be filed Friday in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration aides said the suit will argue that the federal government's 
immigration policy violates the Constitution's 10th Amendment -- which defines 
state authority -- because it amounts to a de facto infringement of 
California's sovereignty. The state, Wilson says, no longer can spend its tax 
dollars as it wishes because it must spend nearly 10% of its budget serving 
people the federal government should be keeping out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also will contend that the federal government's shifting of 
immigration costs to the states violates the constitutional provision 
establishing a republican form of government. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a situation where one level of government sets policy but the 
cost is imposed on the taxpayers of another level of government, there's no 
accountability on the people who created the problem in the first place," said 
Leslie Goodman, the governor's communications director. 
</P>
<P>
 The California lawsuit comes as states across the country are pressuring the 
federal government to do more to enforce the nation's immigration laws and to 
help those states most burdened by the costs of serving illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 New York has been trying since 1990 to get the federal government to pay for 
the cost of keeping illegal immigrants in state prison. Florida filed suit 
earlier this month to recover $1.5 billion for a range of services it has 
provided over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration last year responded by fully funding a program to 
reimburse the states for some of the costs associated with illegal immigration 
and now is proposing $350 million to help states pay for prison beds for 
illegal immigrants convicted of felonies. The federal crime bill that the House 
of Representatives passed last week would require the federal government to 
pick up the entire tab for imprisoning illegal immigrants, beginning in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton also has proposed beefing up the Border Patrol and is 
working with the states to refine the process through which non-citizens are 
deported after serving time in state prisons, said Tom Epstein, a White House 
political aide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have operated very much in good faith," Epstein said. "We have done a 
great deal to address the problems of illegal immigration since this 
Administration took office." 
</P>
<P>
 Epstein said Wilson's energy would be better spent lobbying Congress. "Gov. 
Wilson is well aware that getting additional money for these purposes is not 
going to be easy," Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson said Congress has made promises in the past only to break them. And 
he noted that INS Commissioner Doris Meissner recently said it may take a year 
or longer to develop a new immigration policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next year is too late," Wilson said. "California simply cannot afford to 
wait." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was met by demonstrators who accused him of racism. But Wilson, in his 
speech, said he harbors no ill will toward those who seek to enter this country 
by any means. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one is condemning the illegal immigrants," he said. "It is those in 
Washington that we should condemn."

THOSE WHO BEGAN TALKS REJECT EMERGING ISRAEL-PLO PACT; MIDEAST: A PALESTINIAN 
EX-NEGOTIATOR SAYS THE ACCORD FALLS SHORT. LIKUD LEADER NETANYAHU, ALSO AN 
EARLY DELEGATE, CRITICIZES IT FOR GOING TOO FAR.

 As Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization conclude terms for 
Palestinian self-rule, leaders who began the negotiations 2 1/2 years ago 
rejected the emerging accord Monday as far from the original goals and likely 
to bring further conflict rather than peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Haidar Abdel-Shafi, who led the Palestinian delegation to the first peace 
talks with Israel, said Palestinians will regard the autonomy agreement as 
without legitimacy because it fails to check expansion of Israeli settlements 
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip; secure Israel's withdrawal from the 
areas, and ensure Palestinian self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
 "The signing of such agreements will not prevent the continued struggle of our 
people against the illegal actions of the Israeli occupier," he declared in a 
statement also signed by more than 20 other leading Palestinian political 
figures from Gaza and the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 An equally stern warning came on the Israeli side from Benjamin Netanyahu, now 
chairman of the opposition Likud Party but a ranking member of then-Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's delegation to the Madrid peace conference in October, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "This agreement will bring greater insecurity, greater terrorism and 
eventually the resumption of open conflict," Netanyahu said, arguing that 
Israel has given so much away in negotiations that its security now depends on 
"little more than promises from (PLO Chairman) Yasser Arafat." 
</P>
<P>
 The double-barreled warnings were a reminder of the serious doubts that have 
arisen among Israelis and Palestinians about the character of the autonomy 
agreement and the nature of Palestinian self-government. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public mood says that something has gone wrong with this," Netanyahu 
said. "There has been a sea change in public opinion. . . . Even in the 
government there are second thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat should understand, Abdel-Shafi said, that "with each concession, each 
compromise, he cuts away what support he still has for this agreement . . . and 
really he is cutting away support now for the whole peace process." 
</P>
<P>
 According to opinion polls of both Israelis and Palestinians, the length of 
the negotiations -- they have been under way since October -- and the failure 
to follow the agreed-upon timetable have greatly undermined popular support. 
</P>
<P>
 But even more damage was done by terrorist attacks, notably the massacre by a 
Jewish settler of about 30 Palestinians in a West Bank mosque two months ago 
and the assaults -- including two recent, murderous car bombings -- by Islamic 
militants on Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 Ghassan Khatib, a professor at Birzeit University and another veteran 
Palestinian negotiator, said the proposed agreement goes too far in 
legitimizing Israel's long occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, 
particularly Jewish settlements there; it also falls short of Palestinian 
desires for self-determination, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will not be a gain but a setback for us and for peace," Khatib warned. 
"This agreement lacks legitimacy, it will be rejected by the people, and it 
thus will fail. We can already see the resulting conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 But Khatib and Netanyahu disagree profoundly on the way forward. Khatib, a 
leader of the pro-Communist Palestine People's Party, wants the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip firmly on the road to Palestinian statehood. Netanyahu sees such 
statehood as an even greater threat to Israel and instead wants the 
Palestinians to accept self-rule under Israeli sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, in London, the United States announced Monday that it will back a 
request from Jordan's King Hussein to end the naval blockade around the 
Jordanian port of Aqaba and replace it with land-based inspections to prevent 
goods from passing through Jordan to Iraq in violation of U.N. sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 After talks with the king, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the 
shift will accommodate Jordanian economic concerns but "will also make it 
easier to sustain and enhance the sanctions against Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Jordan had served as a primary 
conduit of goods -- from war materiel to basic foods -- for Iraq. The blockade 
on Aqaba was put in place largely because goods continued to be smuggled, 
principally by falsified papers, through the kingdom after U.N. sanctions were 
imposed. All ships sailing through the Gulf of Aqaba for Jordan have been 
inspected by ships of the U.S.-led coalition.

SOCIAL ISSUES; HAWAII TRIES TO TAKE A STAND AGAINST SAME-SEX MARRIAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN ESSOYAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 In this state celebrated for its tolerance of cultural diversity, lawmakers 
are scrambling to derail a court case they fear has gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature passed a bill Monday to prevent Hawaii from becoming the first 
state to allow people of the same sex to marry. But there is no guarantee that 
the courts will agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now is not the time to embark on a bold experiment that would take us further 
along the road of deteriorating family values," warned state Sen. Stan Koki, 
joining a lopsided vote for the bill limiting marriage to male-female couples. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue burst onto the public stage when the state Supreme Court ruled last 
May that denying a marriage license to people of the same sex was 
unconstitutional, unless the state could show a compelling reason to do so. The 
justices based their decision on the equal protection clause of the state 
constitution, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of people have gone to the Capitol to make their views known, 
hoisting signs ranging from "Equal Rights for All" to "God Created Adam and 
Eve, Not Adam and Steve." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want special rights, we want the same rights that everybody else 
has," Ninia Baehr, one of the plaintiffs who had appealed to the Supreme Court, 
told legislators during emotional hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 But her view was overwhelmed by testimony from the other side. Many opponents 
consider same-sex unions sacrilegious and fear that Hawaii will become a "gay 
marriage mecca." 
</P>
<P>
 The case has national implications, since other states would have to decide 
whether to continue recognizing all of Hawaii's marriages, state Deputy Atty. 
Gen. Steven Michaels said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, which goes to the governor, notes the state's intent to "foster and 
protect the propagation of the human race" and directs the court to stop trying 
to make social policy. Lawmakers hope it will bolster the state's 
compelling-interest argument when the Circuit Court tries the case in April, 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation also sets up a commission on sexual orientation to study the 
legal and economic benefits of marriage and whether they should be extended to 
same-sex couples. A proposed constitutional amendment limiting marriage to "one 
man and one woman," one sure way to block the court's ruling, died during the 
legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of Hawaii residents oppose same-sex marriages -- with 58% against, 
32% in favor and 10% undecided, according to a Honolulu Star-Bulletin poll 
conducted in January. Opposition has been led by the Catholic and Mormon 
churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet others suggest that Hawaii is an appropriate place for this groundbreaking 
step. Known worldwide as a melting pot, the state has a strong tradition of 
tolerance and a progressive legislative streak. It was the first to ratify the 
equal rights amendment and the first to legalize abortion. In 1991, it barred 
discrimination against homosexuals in employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent research shows that before missionaries arrived here, homosexual 
relationships were accepted in Hawaii. Hawaiian kings and chiefs openly took 
male lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 That cultural context might be important in deciding the court case, contends 
Daniel R. Foley, attorney for the three homosexual couples who are suing the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley questions the state's procreation argument, noting that overpopulation 
may be a more pressing concern and that infertile couples are allowed to marry. 
He also dismisses the Legislature's suggestion that the court should not be 
making policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Martin Luther King had gone to the Alabama state Legislature for help, the 
schools would still be segregated today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not about publicly approving or disapproving of a form of 
relationship," state Sen. Matthew Matsunaga said. "It is about safeguarding the 
rights of citizens regardless of attitudes." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial issue has triggered a threat from the American Family Assn. 
of Tupelo, Miss., to boycott travel to Hawaii. While some hoteliers worry that 
allowing gay marriage will scare off mainstream tourists, others suggest that 
honeymooning same-sex couples would boost the economy.

DATELINE: NASHVILLE; PUTTING THE TWANG BACK IN THE CITY'S HEART; THE GRAND OLE 
OPRY LEFT THE RYMAN AUDITORIUM 20 YEARS AGO. NOW THE RED-BRICK LANDMARK WILL BE 
FILLED WITH MUSIC, AND A MUSEUM, AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Perhaps it was inevitable. The Grand Ole Opry, that venerable country music 
institution, packed up 20 years ago from its longtime home in the red-brick 
Ryman Auditorium downtown and moved to the suburbs. After all, that's where the 
fans were going. 
</P>
<P>
 And for some years now, fans shuttling between such commercial enterprises as 
Twitty City and the antiseptic glamour of Opryland -- a combination amusement 
park and Las Vegas-style resort, sans sin -- frequently have found time for 
pilgrimages to the Ryman, to walk its sacred aisles, touch its weathered pews 
and remember. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the auditorium -- a onetime church in a funky corner of downtown -- is 
about to reopen as a music venue and museum, part of a redevelopment effort 
that is turning the city's heart into an entertainment mecca far surpassing 
what it was in the Ryman's heyday. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the $8-million Ryman renovation, the company that owns the Opry 
is building a $7.5-million downtown country dance club that also will be used 
for taping shows for The Nashville Network on cable television. 
</P>
<P>
 The club is being built on Second Avenue, which already is becoming a vibrant 
entertainment district with jazz and rock clubs, restaurants and shops. A Hard 
Rock Cafe will open next door. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to downtown's luster is the city's plan to build a sports and 
entertainment arena in hopes of landing a professional basketball or hockey 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't believe that we can be a first-rate city, a city that's 
attractive, without a living and vital downtown," said Mayor Phil Bredesen, who 
is credited with pushing the arena plan and a package of Opryland tax breaks 
through the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last year, downtown development moved at a fairly languid pace, slowed 
no doubt by the seedy gathering of honky-tonks, pawnshops and pornographic 
bookstores on Broadway, near Second Avenue. The seediness is what drove the 
Opry away in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to move the Opry out of there because it was supported by tourists," 
said E. W. Wendell, president and chief operating officer of Gaylord 
Entertainment Co., which owns the auditorium and Opryland. "They'd come to town 
to see the famous Grand Ole Opry and their cars would get broken into. They'd 
get mugged. We had to find another location or we'd cease to exist." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor notes that the convention center and a major hotel were built in the 
mid-1980s with their backs to Broadway, once the city's grand avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that is changing. With development spilling over onto the street, it is 
doubtful the unsavoriness can survive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Country Music Hall of Fame announced in February that it would relocate to 
the area from Music Row, where the recording industry is centered west of 
downtown. That alone is expected to draw 300,000 people to the area annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendell doesn't think the new attractions will detract from Opryland. 
</P>
<P>
 On the contrary, the sprawling suburban complex is expanding its program of 
live music and adding to its already huge hotel-convention center. When the 
$175-million expansion is complete, the 2,870-room hotel will include such 
features as moving sidewalks, a $7.2-million retail operation and a 
60-foot-wide indoor "river," Opryland executive Jack Vaughn said. 
Conventioneers will be able to travel by boat from exhibition halls to the food 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 To get downtown from the Opryland complex, visitors will cross the real river 
-- the Cumberland -- on water taxis. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendell said he hopes the developments will make tourists want to plan 
weeklong vacations in Nashville instead of the now-typical weekend stays. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapid growth of Branson, Mo., as a family oriented spot to hear live 
country music had nothing to do with the developments, the mayor and Opryland 
officials insist. But Bredesen admits Branson may represent something of a lost 
opportunity if not an outright challenge to Nashville's primacy as the capital 
of country music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see it hurting us," he said. "It certainly doesn't hurt Opryland. A 
fine hotel with impressive musical acts doesn't compare with going to a strip 
someplace in Missouri, staying in a trailer park and going somewhere to see 
country shows. That's not the field I choose to compete on." 
</P>
<P>
 Sounding considerably less disdainful, Wendell said: "Nashville is really the 
heart and soul of country music because this is the creative community. This is 
where the songwriters are, and this is where the publishing companies are. 
Anything that promotes country music -- I don't care if it's Branson, Mo., or 
downtown Los Angeles or New York City -- anything that promotes country music 
is good for us."

GERMAN BANK DEFENDS LOANS TO FUGITIVE IT ACCUSES OF FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARJORIE MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Facing a crisis of confidence, Germany's largest bank defended itself Monday 
against charges that it acted blindly in lending more than $700 million to 
fugitive real estate mogul Juergen Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
 Deutsche Bank chief executive Hilmar Kopper said his financial institution was 
the victim of a "systematically prepared and executed fraud" in which Schneider 
possibly had help. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopper conceded that the bank made mistakes that could cost it hundreds of 
millions of dollars, but he offered assurances that the thousands of Schneider 
employees and subcontractors will be paid money owed them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There can be no doubt about the standing of Deutsche Bank or the German 
banking system as a whole. There is no cause whatsoever for a crisis of 
confidence," Kopper said at a news conference in Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider was one of the country's biggest, flashiest real estate tycoons, 
with about 80 fancy projects nationwide. He and his wife, Claudia, vanished 
earlier this month owing about $3 billion to 40 banks and $150 million more in 
unpaid bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had sole control over their companies' accounts and apparently took 
tens of millions of dollars with them. Media speculation on their whereabouts 
ranges from Florida to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 Deutsche Bank, Schneider's biggest creditor, has filed a lawsuit against the 
Schneiders, accusing them of having secured their loans with false documents. 
But the media have criticized financial institutions -- Deutsche Bank, in 
particular -- for repeatedly making bad loans to big business. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, the banks serve on supervisory boards of businesses to which 
they lend. In January, 120 banks had to bail out the Metallgesellschaft metals 
and engineering group for $2 billion after it ran up a debt of about $5.5 
billion. Deutsche Bank was also the biggest creditor there and a board member. 
</P>
<P>
 In Schneider's case, it has been reported that the banks may have relaxed 
tight lending criteria to allow him to borrow up to 90% of a project's value. 
The banks continued lending to him despite his reputation for delinquency with 
his suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 German media have noted repeatedly that Deutsche Bank received a goodby letter 
from Schneider on April 7 but sat on the news for days without notifying police 
or taking other action. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekly newsmagazine Der Spiegel summed up much of the critical national 
and international media coverage of the banks with a short line in its six-page 
story: "Poor Deutsche Bank." The magazine quoted the Frankfurt Public 
Prosecutor's office as saying that even after filing suit, the bank withheld 
relevant files in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kopper said that the bank's "gravest error was that we let ourselves be 
duped." He added that no bank employees will be fired or made scapegoats.

NEWS ANALYSIS; GLOBAL POWERS ONCE AGAIN PARALYZED BY BOSNIA CRISIS; BALKANS: 
SERBS BOAST OF STARING DOWN NATO. WORLD LEADERS CAN'T SQUARE FEAR OF QUAGMIRE 
WITH DESIRE TO END THE KILLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After almost 3,000 dead or wounded in Gorazde, after another "safe haven" has 
been trampled, after NATO's threat of massive force has thus far produced only 
limited air strikes, the international community has reverted to fretful 
paralysis over what to do about Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Protection Force remains handcuffed by a mandate to keep peace in a 
country where there is none. Relief organizations still must wheedle and 
negotiate with the dominant Bosnian Serb rebels to get food, medicine and 
shelter to the war's civilian victims. 
</P>
<P>
 And the world powers that chose humanitarian intervention over halting the 
bloodshed when it began are searching for an easy way out of the tragedy that 
becomes more difficult and costly to rectify with each passing day. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two years after the outbreak of the worst violence in Europe since 
World War II, world leaders still cannot square their fears of being drawn into 
an endless conflict with a nagging desire to do something to make the killing 
of innocents stop. 
</P>
<P>
 The most dangerous consequence of the Gorazde crisis, which rocketed to the 
political fore this month, may be the message drawn by the Bosnian Serbs that 
they can take on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and win. 
</P>
<P>
 Air strikes launched April 10 and 11 were limited displays of the Western 
alliance's power. But their intended lesson was grossly distorted by 
propagandists who mold Serbian public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebel leaders -- like the hard-line Bosnian Serb commander Gen. Ratko Mladic, 
already inflated with overconfidence from having rolled over poorly armed 
government troops in a lopsided blood bath -- now boast of having stared down 
mighty NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one can save us from the Serbs now!" wailed a frightened Muslim woman 
evacuated from Gorazde to Sarajevo on Monday as part of a U.N.-organized 
airlift. 
</P>
<P>
 The commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia, Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, has invoked a 
new motto for the peacekeeping mission with his declaration that he has no 
intention of "bombing our way to peace," despite the Bosnian Serbs' lukewarm 
compliance with a NATO edict to withdraw from around Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 Cmdr. Eric Chaperon, a U.N. spokesman, said Monday that all Bosnian Serb 
artillery was believed to have been pulled back 1.9 miles from Gorazde, 
although he conceded that some Bosnian Serb troops had still not withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 A further test of Serbian compliance will come tonight when another NATO 
deadline expires; the rebels are to have moved all of their heavy artillery at 
least 12 miles from Gorazde by 2:01 a.m. Wednesday (5:01 p.m. today PDT). 
</P>
<P>
 There are fears among U.N. officers, Rose included, that the Serbs may simply 
redeploy the tanks and artillery banished from Gorazde to other vulnerable 
areas they are known to covet for their emerging state of Greater Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were Mladic, I'd hit somewhere else fast, as soon as I could get 
everything moved up there," one U.N. officer said. He speculated that the next 
target could be the area around Brcko, which the rebels want to widen the 
territorial connection between land conquered in eastern Bosnia and in Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 By turning a blind eye to recalcitrant rebels who burned homes and blasted 
utilities as they beat a grudging retreat, Rose calmed the NATO demand for 
immediate punishment that would probably lead to an escalated conflict between 
his 15,000-strong peacekeeping force and the radicalized Serbs. The U.N. 
Protection Force is deployed to Bosnia for humanitarian purposes only, and any 
action seen as partial to the government would prompt the Serbs to declare war 
on the peacekeeping mission. 
</P>
<P>
 But some here believe the United Nations is simply postponing the inevitable 
in refusing to take sides in the deadly conflict, which most world leaders say 
was provoked by nationalist Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's meetings in London and Geneva to devise a Western strategy for the 
Bosnian crisis seem to underscore that there has so far been no consensus or 
definition of policy and objectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Even NATO and the U.N. peacekeeping force have shown themselves at odds over 
how they should respond to blatant and destabilizing displays of aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 When NATO commanders sought to order air strikes against Bosnian Serbs who 
defied the withdrawal ultimatum Sunday, Yasushi Akashi, the civilian chief of 
the U.N. Protection Force, rejected the appeal as unnecessary because he had 
reached separate and more lenient terms for compliance with Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi also apparently softened the NATO order for Serbs to grant unhindered 
freedom of movement to U.N. troops and humanitarian organizations, allowing the 
rebels to resume their harassing insistence on clearance for vehicles, aircraft 
and aid personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Letting the Bosnian Serbs win their first round with NATO also risks 
encouraging them to stand tough in future faceoffs, which even the most 
optimistic U.N. officers are already bracing for. 
</P>
<P>
 Western mediators and leaders continue to believe peace talks will one day 
lead to a negotiated resolution of the war, despite the numerous failed 
diplomatic initiatives involving the Bosnian Serbs and their allies in Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 With no credible threat of force to stop their advances, and dwindling U.N. 
options for even maintaining an illusion of keeping the peace, the conflict in 
Bosnia appears fated to continue with political leaders talking in faraway 
capitals while their warlords fight on.

ALLIES TAKE NEW TACK TO END BOSNIA WAR; DIPLOMACY: U.S., EUROPEAN UNION, U.N., 
RUSSIA WILL MEET FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY IN SEARCH OF A PERMANENT CEASE-FIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After high-level talks, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and British 
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd announced Monday that the United States, Russia, 
the United Nations and the European Union will launch a joint diplomatic 
initiative to move the Bosnian crisis toward a permanent cease-fire and a 
political settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 They hope to coordinate the oft-confused array of international peace efforts 
and give their coalition greater clout in dealing with the warring parties in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 Their new "contact group" is scheduled to meet for the first time here today. 
It is intended to follow up on the ultimatum that took effect last weekend 
ordering Bosnian Serbs to withdraw from the besieged Bosnian city of Gorazde -- 
and to prevent the confrontations that have followed other Balkan cease-fires. 
</P>
<P>
 This group "is a way . . . to try to regain the momentum that existed prior to 
the situation in Gorazde and to try to carry forward, to build on some 
tentative agreements that were reached (at earlier peace talks) in Geneva," 
Christopher said at a news conference after talks with British Prime Minister 
John Major. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next two weeks, group members are expected to engage in talks with the 
largely Muslim government and Serbian and Croatian forces about outlines of a 
Bosnian peace plan. The result is likely to be a loose confederation or union 
of two or more Muslim, Serbian and Croatian areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The assumption continues to be that the integrity of Bosnia will be preserved 
and that the political solution that will result would take that into account," 
said a senior U.S. official on the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurd said any peace must involve a "substantial withdrawal" by Bosnian Serbs. 
But Christopher indicated that the Muslim government will not get back 
significant areas lost militarily in the two-year war, which has led to more 
than 200,000 dead or missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe anybody has recently thought that the matter could go back to 
where it was at the very beginning," Christopher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed on why the Bosnian Serbs should be any more cooperative this time 
after repeatedly breaking previous cease-fires and violating U.N.-declared 
"safe havens," Hurd tried to strike an optimistic note about the latest 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they want to have a settled future, if they want to reconstruct towns and 
villages, if they want to see some decent standard of living for themselves and 
their children, if they want a place in Europe and the world, then they'll need 
to settle," he said. "Because they're not going to achieve any of those things 
by hanging on to land which they now occupy by force." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, President Clinton also tried to sound upbeat. "It appears that 
the pressure brought to bear by NATO and the United Nations has worked, that 
the cease-fire is working, that the withdrawal is continuing. It's now clearly 
time to get the diplomatic initiatives going again while we maintain our 
vigilance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 European officials hope this initiative will lead to an international 
conference on Bosnia. Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin and French President 
Francois Mitterrand have both favored a summit of world powers and Bosnian 
factions. But U.S. officials stressed Monday that weeks of preparatory work 
must be done before a decision on a conference can even be made. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the Clinton Administration is issuing warnings about potential 
cease-fire violations or delays. Christopher, who conducted his meetings on the 
eve of a Tuesday night deadline for Serbian forces to withdraw their heavy 
weapons at least 12 miles from Gorazde, pointedly noted that his discussions 
had convinced him of the "clear resolve on all of our parts to enforce the NATO 
deadline."

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; GROUPS REPORT A SURGE OF INTEREST IN 'LIVING WILLS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The late Richard Nixon's decision to make his explicit wishes known about the 
course of his medical treatment during his final hours has resulted in a surge 
of new interest in the concept of the "living will," medical ethicists and 
others said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our lines have been completely jammed," said Ann Fade, director of legal 
services for Choice in Dying, a New York-based organization that provides forms 
for people interested in writing such documents. "We send out about a quarter 
of a million living wills a year -- but the number goes up, depending on what's 
happening in the news." 
</P>
<P>
 She said her organization, which sends the paperwork for free, typically 
receives 100 to 200 telephone calls a day, but in the days since Nixon's death, 
"we've been getting 500 a day." 
</P>
<P>
 The former president, who died Friday night in New York four days after 
suffering a major stroke, apparently had made it clear that he wanted no 
extraordinary medical measures taken if he developed a serious condition that 
would leave him incapacitated, particularly intellectually. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the advantages of living wills, studies show that no more than 20% of 
the U.S. population has them, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to get people to do it," said George Annas, director of the law, 
medicine and ethics program at Boston University. "Hardly any Americans fill 
out any forms at all unless they're required by law. They don't want to think 
about death. Or when they think about it, they would rather talk about it than 
write something down. They're superstitious. My mother's like that -- 'If I 
write it down, it means I'm going to die.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Fade, of Choice in Dying, said "most people think: 'Oh, I want my family to 
make these decisions for me,' " and automatically assume they can, when "in 
some states, your family can't -- treatment just has to continue. The family 
doesn't always have a say unless you specifically designate them." 
</P>
<P>
 Most experts believe that while a living will is useful, it may be more 
valuable to give a surrogate a "health proxy" -- granting that person the legal 
status to make critical medical decisions in the event an individual is 
incapable of doing so. Living wills by themselves may prove to be inadequate 
because they cannot address all potential medical situations and are subject to 
interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 Most states have statutes providing for the right of individuals to create 
living wills, also known as advanced directives, and to appoint health proxies 
who have the durable power of attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, California became one of the first states in the nation to establish 
statutes providing for living wills and health proxies. 
</P>
<P>
 The statutes make it clear that medical personnel following instructions in a 
living will are not criminally liable, said Alex Capron, UCS professor of law 
and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 It is important to talk with the surrogate at length "and make your wishes 
known," Capron said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, all states are subject to the Patient Self-Determination Act, a federal 
law that requires all health care facilities -- hospitals, nursing homes, 
hospices -- to offer patients information about the relevant laws in their 
state regarding living wills and durable power of attorney.

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; CLINTON PLANS BRIEF STAY FOR FUNERAL; ITINERARY: THE

 President Clinton's trip to California for the funeral of former President 
Richard Nixon will be a brief one, and he will hold no substantive discussions 
with foreign leaders who may attend the service, White House officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the State Department invited all current heads of state to the 
Wednesday funeral at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace in Yorba Linda, no 
foreign leader currently in office is expected to attend, according to a senior 
White House source. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton will arrive at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station less than an hour 
before the funeral and will leave California 2 1/2 hours after it ends. He 
plans to meet privately with Nixon family members before the rites and will 
attend two closed receptions afterward, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the receptions may provide an opportunity for informal encounters with 
foreign dignitaries, including the current Chinese ambassador and the recently 
resigned Japanese prime minister, no substantive foreign policy business will 
take place, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President senses it would be in bad taste to hold any bilateral (talks) 
there, so there just won't be any," said a senior member of the 
Administration's foreign policy team. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department's protocol office over the weekend created a "Nixon task 
force" to coordinate the invitation of foreign leaders to the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman said that 40 foreign delegations were scheduled to come. But she 
said that the identities of most of the attendees were being kept confidential 
for reasons of protocol and security. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said that Russian Deputy Premier 
Alexander N. Shokhin, former British Prime Minister Edward Heath, former 
Israeli President Chaim Herzog and former Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa are expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa was forced to resign earlier this month because of allegations of 
financial improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
 China will be represented by Li Daoyu, Beijing's ambassador to Washington, 
according to a State Department official. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese Premier Li Peng has been traveling in Central Asia, and President 
Jiang Zemin visited the United States last November. They were unavailable to 
attend the Nixon rites. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott will attend; Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher left Sunday for a weeklong trip to Europe and the Middle 
East. 
</P>
<P>
 Other top Administration officials and the Democratic congressional leadership 
will accompany Clinton to California aboard Air Force One. 
</P>
<P>
 The backup presidential 747 is being made available to transport former Nixon 
Cabinet members and other VIPs, while Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas 
will fly with top congressional Republicans aboard a third government aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The other living ex-presidents -- Jimmy Carter, George Bush, Ronald Reagan and 
Gerald R. Ford -- will travel privately to Orange County, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's first vice president, Spiro T. Agnew, also will attend the services. 
Agnew, who resigned the vice presidency in 1973 after pleading no contest to 
charges of tax evasion, asked Julie Nixon Eisenhower if he would be welcome at 
the service and was told that he would be, according to a knowledgeable source. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's body will arrive at El Toro at 12:35 p.m. PDT today from Stewart Air 
National Guard Base in Newburgh, N.Y., aboard the same converted Air Force 707 
that took him to California after he resigned the presidency in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 The same plane, with tail number 27000, bore the body of Nixon's wife, Pat, to 
California after she died last June. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon will be interred next to her on the grounds of the Nixon Library.

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; FEDERAL OFFICES, AGENCIES WILL BE CLOSED WEDNESDAY 
</P>

<P>
 In declaring Wednesday a national day of mourning and asking people to go to 
their place of worship to grieve, President Clinton has accorded Richard 
Nixon's passing the same honor granted other presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 All federal offices, Congress and the Supreme Court will close in a gesture of 
respect for Nixon, the nation's 37th President, who died Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service will suspend regular mail delivery and window service for 
the day, although mail processing and transport will continue. Special Delivery 
and Express Mail will be delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 The honor was a matter of choice for Clinton. There are no rules or 
obligations attached to the death of former presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing all federal offices and services, including the Postal Service, will 
cost taxpayers more than $330 million, according to figures from the federal 
Office of Personnel Management. Of that total, $308 million is the amount it 
costs to fund the government payroll each day, and on Wednesday federal 
employees will be paid despite having the day off. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there will be an added cost of $23 million in "premium pay" for 
selected government workers ordered to remain on the job in case of 
emergencies, said Janice Lechance, a spokeswoman for the personnel agency. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget noted that federal 
agencies will have to cut back elsewhere, including possibly on services, to 
make up for the $23 million. The money will not be added to the federal 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the federal government, the New York Stock Exchange, the 
American Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq market will close. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said it plans to close its stock index futures 
and options contracts Wednesday, but the Chicago Board of Trade plans a regular 
trading session. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court will be closed, but decisions by other federal courts will 
be left to the chief judge in each circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The honor being accorded Nixon is not unusual. Every President since Harry S. 
Truman has been given at least a day of mourning. Federal records do not go 
back further. 
</P>
<P>
 John F. Kennedy received four days of mourning, beginning with Friday Nov., 
22, 1963 -- the afternoon of his assassination -- and extending through the 
following Monday, the day of his funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon ordered a day of mourning and all federal offices closed for Dwight D. 
Eisenhower in March, 1969, for Truman in January, 1973, and for Lyndon. B. 
Johnson one month later. 
</P>
<P>
 The proclamation Clinton issued Saturday honoring Nixon closely followed the 
form that Nixon developed for Eisenhower's death.

 Soldiers massacred at least 23 fishermen and merchants in a west coast slum 
loyal to ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, witnesses and human rights 
advocates said Monday.The killings followed a wave of attacks on Haiti's 
pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
 The soldiers raided a seaside neighborhood in the city of Gonaives on 
Saturday, firing shots in the air but causing no reported injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours later, they returned and began shooting indiscriminately at people 
gathering firewood on the beach. The troops also commandeered rowboats and 
attacked fishermen off shore. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies washed ashore gradually: three on Saturday and at least 20 from 
Sunday to early Monday afternoon, said the witnesses, speaking on condition of 
anonymity.

WELFARE-JOB STUDY INDICATES TOUGH TASK FOR REFORM PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first nationwide study of a welfare-to-work program for women sends mixed 
messages about the likelihood of success for the Clinton Administration plan to 
place welfare recipients in jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Carnevale, chairman of the National Commission for Employment Policy, 
which conducted the study, said that training and job placement programs can 
move people off the welfare rolls but that only a fraction of current 
recipients will be able to do so and become stable members of the labor force 
-- a finding that has important implications for the two-year time limit the 
President wants to put on welfare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Administration's plan for welfare reform, which is expected to be 
introduced to Congress late next month, welfare recipients would be required to 
go to work after two years on the rolls. People who cannot find work after two 
years would be offered public service jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The study shows, however, that even a select group of welfare recipients who 
are motivated enough to volunteer for a job training program have only a 50% 
chance of staying employed through the first year after training. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two years and out is more a bumper sticker than a program," said Carnevale. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Bloom, an employment and training analyst at the Center on Budget and 
Policy Priorities, a liberal domestic policy think-tank, agreed that the study 
shows that many welfare recipients have a very difficult time getting and 
keeping jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even among a highly motivated and well-prepared group of welfare recipients, 
a lot of them would end up running up against the time limit," Bloom said. 
"That means you're going to have to create a lot of jobs. It's sobering in 
terms of what you can accomplish with such training programs." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's study tracked 6,467 women on Aid to Families With Dependent 
Children who enrolled in training and employment services under the federal Job 
Training and Partnership Act in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 None had worked for at least a year before beginning classroom study or 
on-the-job training with JTPA. After participating in JTPA for roughly four to 
six months, three-fourths of the women were placed in a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of those women were working in every quarter of the year after they 
completed the program. Of those who went to work, only 16% rose above the 
poverty level in the first year and 22% in the second year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Administration saw the study results in a favorable light. "These 
results suggest that our approach to ending welfare works even in the current 
world, where welfare can be more attractive than work," said Bruce Reed, a 
co-chairman of the Administration's welfare reform working group and an adviser 
to the President for domestic issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's plan would expand the job training and placement 
opportunities and child-care services available to people trying to make the 
transition from welfare to work. To keep costs down, the plan will be phased 
in, initially affecting only those welfare recipients who were born after 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed said that the Administration's welfare reform would be more successful 
than previous job training programs for welfare recipients because it will be 
implemented as part of a broader initiative aimed at making work attractive. 
Health care reform and an expanded earned-income tax credit, which would boost 
one-wage-earner families out of poverty, are other key parts of the 
Administration's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the Administration's plan said that the study is just one more 
piece of evidence demonstrating that no job training program will reduce 
welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 "The JTPA findings -- like all other findings -- show demonstrable, but in the 
end really quite modest, results in work and increased earnings," said Doug 
Besharov, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute for Public 
Policy Research, a conservative think-tank. "The Administration's welfare 
reform will not accomplish what no country has ever done: take poor, uneducated 
single parents and make them economically self-sufficient." 
</P>
<P>
 The study is the first to evaluate individuals in JTPA programs to determine 
how many obtained employment and were still working after two years. 
</P>
<P>
 It focused on AFDC recipients who started JTPA placement or training programs 
in 1986 and tracked them through 1989. Other studies that tracked smaller 
groups showed similar results.

MICHIGAN COMMISSION FAVORS LEGAL PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD WALSH, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the trial of Jack Kevorkian resumed in Detroit, a deeply divided citizens' 
commission narrowly recommended Monday that Michigan become the first place in 
the world to legalize physician-assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 By a vote of 9 to 7 with four abstentions, the Michigan Commission on Death 
and Dying asked the Legislature to authorize the practice but also called for 
an elaborate set of restrictions to safeguard against abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft measure would authorize physician-assisted suicide for people 18 or 
older who suffer from a "terminal condition" likely to result in death within 
six months or who have an "irreversible suffering condition" involving 
"subjectively unbearable or unacceptable suffering from a physical condition." 
It would require a physician to be present for the suicide, after a detailed 
process involving consultations with another physician, a psychiatrist or 
psychologist, a social worker and an expert in pain management. 
</P>
<P>
 The non-binding vote in a conference room at Michigan State University here 
climaxed a year of deliberations by the commission, which was created by the 
same law under which Kevorkian is being prosecuted for his role in the suicide 
of a 30-year-old, terminally ill Detroit man last August. 
</P>
<P>
 The retired pathologist's trial resumed Monday with the presiding judge 
rejecting a defense motion to dismiss charges, wire services reported. The 
defense had argued that the case was being conducted in the wrong county. 
</P>
<P>
 No country or state has legalized assisted suicide, although the practice is 
common in Holland and is being discussed in Oregon and Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne County Dist. Atty. John O'Hair -- a member of the suicide commission and 
the official who charged Kevorkian -- said that some of the people Kevorkian 
was involved with would not have qualified under the two tests set out in the 
panel's proposal and that Kevorkian's procedures "don't even approach the 
standards that we have recommended." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also recommended by a vote of 9 to 5 with six abstentions a 
proposal regulating the role of physicians in assisting suicide. It would 
authorize only the person who wished to die -- not the physician -- to initiate 
the act.

FIRST LADY INVOKES NIXON NAME IN DRIVE; HEALTH CARE: HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON 
CITES EX-PRESIDENT'S 1974 PROPOSAL TO DEAL WITH UNINSURED AS SHE ADDRESSES 
NATION'S NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS ON MEDICAL INSURANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hillary Rodham Clinton on Monday invoked the name of the late President 
Richard Nixon in an effort to sell the nation's newspaper publishers -- known 
as a conservative bunch -- on Clinton-style health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that President Clinton's controversial plan advocates that companies 
and workers share the cost of a system that would provide medical care for 
everyone, Mrs. Clinton reminded the audience that "Nixon proposed an 
employee-employer system in 1974" to deal with the high number of uninsured 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, 20 years ago as a young law school graduate, the First Lady 
participated in the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment proceedings against 
Nixon, who died Friday at 81. Mrs. Clinton, who spoke at an Associated Press 
luncheon at the Newspaper Assn. of America's annual convention here, strayed 
briefly from her stock speech and seized a moment two days before Nixon's 
funeral to reminisce about her one meeting with Nixon, which took place at the 
White House after the Clintons' arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was extremely gracious," she said of their encounter. "He talked to me 
about health care." 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh from an unusual news conference Friday in Washington where she 
apologized for the way she and the White House had handled questions about her 
financial dealings, Mrs. Clinton sought with her 22-minute speech to refocus 
attention on the project that has consumed her since the first days of the 
Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Her audience of more than 1,000 publishers and editors at the Fairmont Hotel 
on Nob Hill welcomed her warmly, if not effusively. Frank A. Daniels Jr., 
chairman of the Associated Press, introduced her as America's New Age First 
Lady. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton noted that the "great historic debate about health care . . . 
takes an enormous amount of coverage" to explain the complexities. She added 
that "as I follow the coverage, I see how uneven it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Clinton reform, she said, every American would be guaranteed private 
health insurance. The system would also prohibit the insurance industry from 
excluding from coverage those with certain conditions and from imposing limits 
on lifetime benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President's approach guarantees choice of doctor and health plan," a 
choice that fewer than half of the nation's employees have today, she added. 
"If we do nothing about the current marketplace, that choice will become more 
and more illusory."

MOUNTAIN LION APPARENTLY KILLS JOGGER ON FOOTHILLS TRAIL

<TEXT>
<P>
 A mountain lion apparently attacked and killed a woman who was jogging on a 
rugged foothills trail. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Barbara Schoener, 40, was found Sunday morning in the Auburn Lake 
Trails subdivision near Cool, about 40 miles northeast of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The body had claw marks and deputies found animal hairs that will be analyzed,

CLINTON, CABINET OPEN DRIVE AGAINST ASSAULT WEAPONS; LEGISLATION: EFFORT SEEKS 
ENOUGH SUPPORT TO HAVE THE MEASURE INCLUDED IN TALKS RECONCILING HOUSE, SENATE 
VERSIONS OF THE CRIME BILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton and Cabinet officials inaugurated a campaign Monday to 
revive a proposed ban on assault weapons, an issue that has broad public 
support but a woeful legislative record because of opposition from the gun 
lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging the long odds against them, Clinton, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno and 
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen opened a series of public events by appearing 
with relatives of victims of mass slayings. Supporters of the ban say they must 
convert 15 to 20 members of the House of Representatives to win a floor vote 
and put the issue before the congressional conferees who will soon meet to iron 
out differences in the House and Senate versions of the crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be an all-out, uphill battle to win this one," Bentsen conceded in a 
Rose Garden ceremony. The Senate legislation includes a ban on the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Some polls show Americans favor the idea of a ban by margins of nearly three 
to one; and some surveys have suggested that even a majority of staunch 
conservatives want to prohibit such military-style weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 But congressional showdowns have proved humiliating for advocates, and even 
the 1991 mass slaying of 23 persons at a Killeen, Tex., cafeteria only narrowed 
the gap in the House by one vote, with a proposed ban failing by 70 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and an 
opponent of the ban, has agreed to put the issue to a floor vote again because 
he is confident it will fail, sources say. Brooks, who is joined by House 
Speaker Thomas S. Foley in his opposition, applied his influence to keep the 
ban out of the overall crime legislation in the House so that the issue could 
be voted on separately. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping fuel opposition to the ban is the fear some members of Congress have 
about casting a second vote against the National Rifle Assn. Over NRA 
objections, Congress voted earlier this year for the so-called Brady bill, 
which established a minimum five-day waiting period on handgun purchases. 
California already had a 15-day waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of members are saying, 'We voted against the NRA once -- we just can't 
do it again,' " said one House aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the bill's advocates maintain that public sentiment for a ban should be 
strong enough to overcome gun lobby opposition, provided sufficient attention 
is focused to the issue. "There's movement," said Rep. Charles E. Schumer 
(D-N.Y.), a leading advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rose Garden ceremony included remarks by Steven Sposato, whose wife, Jody, 
was among the eight killed when a gunman opened fire last year in a San 
Francisco law firm. Sposato, a Republican, described the devastating impact on 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sight of our 10-month-old daughter, Megan, putting dirt on her mother's 
grave is a sight and a pain I hope no one, no one ever experiences," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen said such assault weapons made up only 1% of guns in circulation in 
the United States, but accounted for 8% of the guns traced by the authorities 
to crimes. "If you're a criminal, if you're a drug kingpin, if you get your 
kicks by drive-by shootings, wouldn't you want the tool that could produce the 
most carnage?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen said that two years ago, when he was in the Senate, his vote in favor 
of a ban brought thousands of letters opposing his decisions. But he said most 
of those came from "special interests that generated that mail." 
</P>
<P>
 In his comments, Clinton told of meeting an immigrant hotel worker during the 
1992 election who said that though his family had more money in America than in 
their former home, they were not free because their 10-year-old son was afraid 
to play in the New York City park across the street from his home. "Freedom is 
an empty word to people who are not even gifted with elemental safety," Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal's advocates say that if the floor vote in the House fails, the 
measure still has a chance to be considered by the conference committee, since 
it was included in the Senate bill. But they acknowledge that those chances 
would be much slimmer. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey by the Los Angeles Times poll last December showed that 71% of 
Americans favor banning the future manufacture, sale or possession of 
rapid-fire assault weapons. Of that group, 58% said they favored the idea 
"strongly." Twenty-four percent said they would oppose the measure. Even among 
respondents who described themselves as "very conservative," the measure was 
favored by a margin of 58% to 34%.

HIGH COURT LETS STAND SOCIAL WORKER IMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over dissents by Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia, the Supreme 
Court on Monday let stand a ruling that makes social workers immune from being 
sued, even if they wrongly accuse a parent of sexually abusing his or her 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 On a 7-2 vote, the justices refused to hear an appeal from a Lexington, Ky., 
man who was stripped of his rights to see his daughter based on an allegation 
by two state social workers that he had abused the child. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither social worker spoke to the girl before filing the charge, but a judge 
-- without giving the father a chance to respond -- ordered visitation rights 
cut off. 
</P>
<P>
 The father, Ian Hoffman, was also arrested and indicted on a charge of child 
sexual abuse based on the allegation, which began with his ex-wife, Melisa. But 
a jury quickly cleared him of the charge, and in a separate proceeding, a judge 
awarded him permanent custody of the child. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman then filed a damage suit contending that his constitutional rights had 
been violated by the state officials. Under federal civil rights law, "Every 
person who under color (of state law) subjects . . . any other person to the 
deprivation of any rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution 
. . . shall be liable to the party injured." 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court has granted a legal immunity to some officials acting under 
state law, including all judges and prosecutors in the courtroom. The justices 
have said that the court system could not operate if prosecutors, judges or 
witnesses could be sued for their courtroom statements. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the lower courts have split over whether social workers can 
be sued. The issue has arisen often in bitter disputes over whether children 
can be taken away from their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hoffman's case, the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed his suit 
and ruled that social workers, like prosecutors, are entitled to "absolute 
immunity from liability." This rule of immunity "ensures that they (social 
workers) are not deterred from vigorously performing their jobs as they might 
if they feared personal liability." 
</P>
<P>
 The California-based U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has adopted the same 
rule, but courts in Colorado, Texas and Delaware have said that social workers 
can be sued in some instances. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Thomas and Scalia voted to hear the appeal in Hoffman vs. Harris, 
93-1044. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not convinced that social workers, who are often involved in civil 
family welfare proceedings, can ever function as prosecutors for purposes of 
immunity analysis," Thomas wrote in a four-page dissent. While the court's 
refusal to hear the appeal is not a binding rule, it strongly suggests that the 
justices support the immunity.

THOUSANDS WILL BE WAITING AS NIXON COMES BACK HOME; SERVICES: CROWDS WILL GREET 
EX-PRESIDENT TODAY AT HIS LIBRARY, WHERE FUNERAL PLANNING CONTINUES. 
SPECULATION CONTINUES REGARDING WHICH WORLD DIGNITARIES WILL ATTEND.

<P>
 Richard Nixon makes his final trip home today, back to the town of his humble 
beginnings and far from the city that he felt had turned on him during his 
deepest political crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands are expected to line up outside the Richard Nixon Library & 
Birthplace this afternoon as the former President is returned to be mourned by 
friends, eulogized by his peers, and buried beside his wife, Pat, at the 
library built to celebrate his greatest triumphs. 
</P>
<P>
 As confirmations for this week's state funeral came in Monday from around the 
world, organizers at the Nixon library prepared for today's public viewing of 
the former President's casket. Nixon died in a New York City hospital Friday 
after suffering a stroke four days earlier in his New Jersey home. 
</P>
<P>
 For those not invited to Wednesday's funeral at the library, this will be the 
only chance to take part in one of the biggest international events ever in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Presidents often lie in state at the Capitol Rotunda in Washington, 
Nixon had specifically rejected that idea, opting for Yorba Linda instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think President Nixon was a deeply private man, and on the eve of his 
death, I think he wanted to be here next to Pat, in this place," Dimitri K. 
Simes, Nixon's top adviser on Russia in the years after his presidency, said at 
the library in Yorba Linda on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, it's a deeply personal, emotional decision -- where your coffin is 
going to be and what people are going to come. He wanted these people to come," 
he said, gesturing to those huddled in the library's rain-swept portico, 
waiting to sign condolence cards for the Nixon family. 
</P>
<P>
 As Wednesday's funeral approaches, speculation continues over who will attend. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton and his four living predecessors -- Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy 
Carter, Ronald Reagan and George Bush -- are all confirmed for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 And while organizers have still not released a full list of foreign 
dignitaries, officials at the White House said that three prominent former 
foreign leaders were also expected to attend: former Prime Minister Edward 
Heath of Great Britain, former President Chaim Herzog of Israel and former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Other confirmed guests cover the political spectrum, from George McGovern -- 
the liberal ex-senator who was swamped by Nixon in the 1972 presidential race 
-- to such onetime Nixon stalwarts as Spiro Agnew, Patrick Buchanan, Charles 
Colson and Alexander Haig. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's daughters, Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie Nixon Eisenhower, and their 
families are accompanying the casket from Newburgh, N.Y., to El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station. From there, a motorcade will take the body to the library. 
It is there, possibly enduring a predicted drizzle, that mourners -- rich and 
poor, old friends and new admirers -- will bid farewell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a day of paying respects to the man and his memory, and I think history 
is going to view him a little more kindly than people do today," said Doy 
Henley, president of the conservative Republican Lincoln Club. "He's a man who 
had a lot of respect and a lot of personal friends here in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, an aerospace manufacturer, said many Lincoln Club members will be in 
the crowd today. Many members have been asking him if he can get them an 
invitation to the funeral itself -- but most will be out of luck, he said. 
"It's going to be a real crowd out there." 
</P>
<P>
 The outpouring of sympathy and support has not gone unnoticed by the Nixons' 
daughters, library spokesman Kevin Cartwright said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been very moved by all the tributes here, people leaving these 
beautiful flowers and coming here to sing and pray and remember him throughout 
the day and night," Cartwright said. "They said they've been comforted by 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said they expect more than 2,000 people in all for Wednesday's 
private funeral at the library. But some of the most persistent questions 
center on who will not be attending. 
</P>
<P>
 Some state lawmakers, for instance, were said to be miffed that they hadn't 
received invitations to the funeral. Aside from Gov. Pete Wilson, who will 
deliver a eulogy, the only California lawmakers attending are Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown, GOP Assembly leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga, Senate 
Democratic leader Bill Lockyer of Hayward and Sen. Ken Maddy, the Senate's 
Republican chief from Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the Orange County delegation in Sacramento had been invited by Monday, 
including Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who knew several members of 
the Nixon family during their post-Watergate days in San Clemente. Others 
included Sen. John F. Lewis (R-Orange) and Assemblyman Ross Johnson 
(R-Placentia), whose districts include the Nixon library. 
</P>
<P>
 Also missing will be current heads of state from many nations, who are sending 
former diplomats to represent them. 
</P>
<P>
 Simes, the Nixon adviser, said the announcement that the funeral would be in 
Yorba Linda, not in Washington, had undoubtedly signaled foreign governments 
that the event would not provide a chance for world leaders to meet with 
President Clinton or each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "The family did not want to turn this into a global conference," he said. "If 
you are a head of state and your presence was desired at President Nixon's 
funeral, they would have held this in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 The funeral service is to begin at 4 p.m. Wednesday, and a program released 
Monday showed that the Rev. Billy Graham will be the first dignitary to speak, 
followed by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Sen. Robert Dole 
(R-Kan.), Wilson and President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 If Nixon had chosen to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery, his 
flag-draped casket would have been carried to the grave site on a black 
artillery caisson pulled by six black or gray horses. Following the caisson 
would have been a riderless horse, wearing an empty saddle with boots reversed 
in the stirrups in honor of a fallen warrior. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the former President chose to be buried at the library next to his 
wife, the occasion will have a less ceremonial air. His casket will be 
transported to Yorba Linda by motorized hearse in a motorcade from El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 For those not invited to the funeral, there will be no shortage of television 
coverage. All the major networks are planning to interrupt regular programming 
to broadcast the funeral live. 
</P>
<P>
 At the library Monday, signs of the coming media storm were everywhere as 
television employees busily erected tents to shelter network anchors Connie 
Chung and Tom Brokaw, and frenzied reporters paced the grounds in search of 
press credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 The first presidential funeral since Lyndon B. Johnson was buried 21 years ago 
will be covered to the hilt, television producers promised. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're giving coverage just like we do the Academy Awards," said one producer 
who asked not to be identified. "It's a major event out here, and I know there 
are a lot of people who are going to want to watch it who aren't going to go 
anywhere near the library." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, harried officials at the library, many of whom have been staying 
there around the clock, tried to cope with the magnitude of planning a state 
funeral. With the White House, the State Department and the military each 
handling certain aspects of the arrangements, coordination has been one of the 
more difficult challenges, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 By midday, nearly 50 people from the White House -- including communications 
and advance staff -- had arrived to assist the library's staff of about 25, and 
some 70 volunteers had called in to help during the last few days, Cartwright, 
the library spokesman, said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The White House has been phenomenal, offering any and all assistance we 
need," Cartwright said, adding that President Clinton personally called the 
library at least twice over the weekend to ask whether any additional help was 
required. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the cold, wet morning and afternoon, a steady, sodden stream of 
onlookers continued to arrive outside the library's closed front doors to leave 
floral tributes to the former President and sign the condolence cards for his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 Diana Beavor, 56, said she drove all night Sunday from her home in Nevada 
City, drawn by a desire to leave her condolences and express her admiration for 
Nixon and his policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just really respected him and liked him," she said, huddled against the 
cold in the library's portico. "I liked what he did in Vietnam and just really 
wanted to be here today." 
</P>
<P>
 Not far away, a large American flag, one of several set up by the library 
staff to frame the doorway, was sent toppling by the fierce winds. 
</P>
<P>
 John Medford, 52, of Los Angeles sat quietly at the library, trying to 
interest passersby in buying old Nixon campaign posters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be irreverent by selling these here, but Richard Nixon stood 
for this: free enterprise," Medford said.

PUBLIC MAY VIEW NIXON CASKET TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today is the day ordinary people can pay respects to the 37th U.S. President. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance at Richard Nixon's funeral on Wednesday is by invitation only, so 
the public's opportunity to participate comes during a 20-hour viewing at 
Nixon's library beginning this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers expect a crowd, but everybody is welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors are invited to start gathering at noon outside the front steps of the 
Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace at 18001 Yorba Linda Blvd., between 
Richfield Road and Lakeview Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The viewing will last from 3 p.m. today until 11 a.m. Wednesday, and library 
staff members expect a steady stream of visitors through the night. Each person 
will be allowed to walk through the lobby and around Nixon's closed casket, and 
will receive a printed thank-you card from the Nixon family. 
</P>
<P>
 Library spokesman Kevin Cartwright said visitors will not be allowed to pause 
for long at the casket, so that more people may pay their respects. He 
suggested a late-night visit to beat the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 To get to the library, take either the Orange Freeway to Yorba Linda Boulevard 
east, or the Riverside Freeway to Imperial Highway to Yorba Linda Boulevard 
west. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's body is scheduled to arrive at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station at 
12:35 p.m. today from New York and will be transported to the library via 
motorcade. After a small ceremony at El Toro, California Highway Patrol 
officers will lead Nixon's hearse and limousines carrying family members to the 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 The planned route for the motorcade is north on the Santa Ana Freeway to the 
Costa Mesa Freeway north to the Riverside Freeway east, then north on Imperial 
Highway -- a portion of which is also called the Richard M. Nixon Freeway. From 
Imperial, the motorcade will turn left on Yorba Linda Boulevard, heading west, 
and then enter the library grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeways and streets will be open as the motorcade passes, but police do not 
want spectators to line the route. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can watch it if they happen to be there, but we don't want to 
advertise," said CHP Sgt. Ted Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's body is expected to arrive at the library about 1:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The only street that will be blocked off today is a tiny stretch of Yorba 
Linda Boulevard, between Eureka and Mountain View avenues, directly in front of 
the library entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the library's parking lot will probably be full, visitors are encouraged 
to seek alternatives. On-street parking is permitted in most of the 
neighborhood. There are also several public lots in the area that might have 
space: 
</P>
<P>
 * The post office at Eureka Avenue and Lemon Drive, around the corner from the 
library. It will be open today but closed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Yorba Linda Middle School at 4777 Casa Loma Ave, less than half a mile from 
the library (walk south on Casa Loma then turn left, heading east on Yorba 
Linda). Schools throughout the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District 
will be closed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Packing House, a shopping center at Imperial Highway and Yorba Linda 
Boulevard, less than half a mile east of the library. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Transportation Authority's bus route No. 26 runs east and 
west along Yorba Linda Boulevard, but today and Wednesday the buses will detour 
around the library. For the viewing, riders can get off at Lakeview Avenue and 
Yorba Linda Boulevard, about half a mile east of the library. The one-way fare 
is $1. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the day of the funeral, logistics are more complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire neighborhood surrounding the library will be closed to the public 
from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Wednesday, with no vehicle or pedestrian traffic allowed 
in the triangle formed by Yorba Linda Boulevard, Valley View Avenue and 
Imperial Highway. Valley View and Imperial will be open to cars, but that 
stretch of Yorba Linda will not. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral parking for invited guests will be available at Cal State Fullerton, 
with shuttle buses to the library. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only invited and ticketed guests will be allowed in the library area. We will 
not allow people to sit on rooftops or anything like that. Businesses have been 
informed that they will effectively be closed for the day," Brea Officer Daniel 
Moon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will try to work with the residents of the area so they can get into their 
homes, and get out in the case of emergency, but we're just encouraging them to 
go somewhere else," Moon said. "There is no public access to the funeral 
services at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Library staffers suggest that people stay home and watch the funeral on 
television; all three major networks, as well as CNN, are planning live 
coverage.

FEDERAL OFFICIALS PRAISE EARTHQUAKE RESPONSE; PREPAREDNESS: WHILE REVIEWING THE 
NORTHRIDGE TEMBLOR, THEY ALSO STRESS A NEED FOR IMPROVEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal officials who gathered here Monday to discuss their effort to help 
Southern California recover from the Northridge earthquake praised themselves 
for responding rapidly and cohesively but stressed the need to improve on 
nearly every front. 
</P>
<P>
 Underlying their discussion was anxiety that the next challenge may be far 
tougher. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a great experience," William E. Clark of the Department of Health 
and Human Services said of the relief program. "But the Big One scares the 
bejeezus out of us." 
</P>
<P>
 He called the Jan. 17 temblor "not the Big One, but the big warning." 
</P>
<P>
 For many of those who met for 3 1/2 hours in a hotel ballroom here, the 
devastating quake in a dense urban area represented high-pressure, on-the-job 
training less than a year after taking office. One participant called the 
effort "the civil equivalent of Operation Desert Storm" -- without the benefit 
of six months of preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal, state and local officials and private relief agencies received high 
marks overall from James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G. Cisneros, 
Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena and other leaders of the federal 
response. "We established a new standard of performance," Pena boasted. 
</P>
<P>
 But others emphasized that the quake's toll would have been far more serious 
had it not occurred before dawn on a Monday morning, and during a holiday at 
that. And several speakers noted that a much more severe quake -- with 
projections of tens of thousands injured and up to $80 billion in damages -- 
could loom ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've come a long way, but we still have a long way to go to be ready," said 
Witt, who quarterbacked the federal relief effort and was host of Monday's 
symposium. 
</P>
<P>
 The participants said there is an urgent need for improved preparedness, 
training, coordination, communication, public education and construction and 
safety measures to limit future injuries and damage. Some expressed concern 
that as soon as a crisis passes it becomes difficult to marshal the public and 
political will to take such necessary, sometimes costly, steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the missteps that federal officials promised to avoid in future 
calamities were: 
</P>
<P>
 * Disaster assistance centers -- some of which opened only four days after the 
Northridge earthquake -- were initially plagued by long lines, slow processing, 
lack of bilingual staff and confusion over emergency housing programs provided 
by different federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * An early rash of false and inflated claims stemmed from suspension of 
standard screening procedures in an emergency food stamp program that parceled 
out $68 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Repair costs for freeways damaged by the Jan. 17 temblor were overestimated 
by California transportation officials, to the tune of $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt and Cisneros acknowledged there had been confusion over the eligibility 
requirements for FEMA's short-term housing grants and HUD's 18-month rental 
vouchers for low-income victims. Cisneros said he would make disaster housing 
assistance available again, but with some modifications. 
</P>
<P>
 He also referred to speculation that the HUD program had prompted Congress to 
crack down on earthquake aid to illegal immigrants. But Cisneros insisted, 
"This issue would have come up no matter what because this is California, it's 
a hot issue there, and it's a political time." 
</P>
<P>
 Oleta G. Fitzgerald, executive assistant to Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, 
said a recent workshop held to assess problems with the emergency food stamp 
program determined that advanced planning with states is necessary to prevent 
fraud and that information about eligibility criteria and penalties for fraud 
should be circulated through the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt said he's seeking to develop three regional "situation assessment" teams 
of federal, state and local officials to make quick, reliable determinations of 
damages and costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans told federal transportation officials that the cost of repairing 
major arteries would be $1.35 billion -- which Congress appropriated. Earlier 
this month, Caltrans reduced the figure by $500 million because several damaged 
bridges and overpasses originally scheduled for demolition and replacement will 
be repaired. A spokeswoman emphasized that the estimate had been 
"super-preliminary." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other goals that officials cited at the post-mortem were that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Efforts should be intensified to construct and retrofit buildings and take 
safety measures to prevent future damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * A stable, long-term funding source to pay for disaster relief and recovery 
costs is needed to end the process of asking Congress to fund these efforts by 
adding to the federal deficit. A Clinton Administration task force and 
lawmakers are looking at this issue. 
</P>
<P>
 * State and local officials must be brought into the process early and often. 
Federal officials said that this was done after the Northridge quake and, Pena 
said, was essential "to send the message that we were operating as a team."

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; NEWS ORGANIZATIONS DESCEND ON O.C. FOR PRESIDENTIAL 
FUNERAL; COVERAGE: TELEVISION, RADIO CREWS FROM AROUND THE WORLD ARRIVE IN TOWN 
FOR ONE OF THE BIGGEST MEDIA EVENTS IN RECENT HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Move over Oprah. "As the World Turns" and "Days of Our Lives" junkies -- brace 
yourselves. For two final days of glory, Richard M. Nixon will rule the daytime 
airwaves and little Yorba Linda will be become a sea of satellite technology. 
</P>
<P>
 As Orange County braced Monday for one of the biggest media events in recent 
history, news organizations from all over the world competed for access and 
major networks busily constructed tents at the Richard Nixon Library & 
Birthplace here to shelter anchors like Tom Brokaw and Connie Chung. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street, producers paced Yorba Linda Boulevard, scribbling ideas for 
live camera angles -- all in preparation for the first Presidential funeral 
since Lyndon B. Johnson died in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first funeral for a President in 21 years and the press is just 
going crazy," said Gayle Anderson, Orange County chief of protocol, who granted 
four television interviews Monday between calls frantically placed to arrange 
the visits of foreign dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The live coverage by all major networks begins today as the body of the 37th 
President takes off at 6:45 a.m. PDT from Stewart Air National Guard Base in 
New York and resumes as the plane descends at the El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station at 12:35 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Coverage will continue as Nixon's body moves by motorcade to the library. 
There also will be full network and local television broadcasts Wednesday as he 
is laid to rest next to his wife, Pat, in a state funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 So sweeping is the media frenzy that one television executive compared it to 
the Los Angeles visit of Pope John Paul II. To a Coast Guard public affairs 
specialist fielding calls from reporters, however, Monday felt more like a 
major naval disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say major oil spills kind of rank right up here with something like this 
-- major oil spills or major marine disasters," said Chief Petty Officer Rick 
Woods, who Monday fielded media calls from reporters from Japan to Britain and 
all over the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a phone in my ear pretty much all day." 
</P>
<P>
 At the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, doors opened at 10 a.m. Monday for 
the press credential scramble. By noon, they were all gone. That included 150 
credentials for the arrival of the casket and 80 credentials granting access to 
the library as Nixon's body lies in state Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Press arrangements for the funeral, however, were still being worked out late 
Monday as the White House took over, said a spokesman at the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Left up in the air, some as-yet-not-credentialed photographers decided to camp 
out across the street from the library in hopes of a good shot. 
</P>
<P>
 For CNN, more than 100 staff people will work the event, including four 
correspondents and Washington anchor Judy Woodruff. Five lumbering satellite 
trucks from that one network alone are already in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 14 producers, where we normally would have five," said David Farmer, 
vice president and bureau chief of CNN Los Angeles, which will use 14 cameras 
to cover the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frenzied, just to get people credentialed and gain access to sites and 
set up this extremely complex coverage situation on such short notice. We had 
people down there on Saturday vying for a spot," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The wet weather Monday didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got alarmed today when it rained heavily. We're just hoping very much that 
it clears up, for the sake of the journalists and the sake of the event," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Brokaw is expected to fly into the area Wednesday morning and he will 
anchor the funeral live. For CBS, Connie Chung will do the honors in Yorba 
Linda, and for ABC, Ted Koppel will anchor the funeral from Washington, as 
correspondents Brit Hume and Jim Wooten cover it from here. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Lehrer of MacNeil/Lehrer Productions will also anchor the funeral, 
although he will do so from New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 If not for the South African elections, all the key anchors would have come 
west. Both Peter Jennings and Dan Rather -- who was CBS chief Washington 
correspondent during the Nixon Administration -- will be on the other side of 
the world today and Wednesday, the networks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahead of the live television assault, about 30 reporters -- some from local 
papers, others from national networks -- hovered for cover Monday about noon as 
it began to rain at the Nixon library. 
</P>
<P>
 Admirers continued to trickle toward the front entrance to visit the 
ever-growing shrine of flowers, balloons and handwritten notes that surrounded 
the photo of the former President outside the front door. 
</P>
<P>
 Bewildered out-of-towners thumbed through a Thomas Bros. map book in hopes of 
deciphering the motorcade route between El Toro and the library. Correspondents 
filmed live stand-ups under umbrellas re-reporting the schedule for today and 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 All morning, reporters furiously dialed cellular phones or fired questions at 
anyone wearing the dark-green circular Nixon library lapel pin. 
</P>
<P>
 They wondered how they'd pipe extra phone lines into the tent during the 
funeral. They wondered where they'd park. 
</P>
<P>
 Most answers came quickly: "I don't know yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Charlyne Tsou, a news reporter for North America TV, a Chinese network based 
in El Monte, said the event will be "an international sensation. It's a big 
deal at home, for both the Nationalists and Communist Chinese." 
</P>
<P>
 Local television affiliates acknowledged that the live coverage will come with 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oprah will not be on on Wednesday," said KABC acting news director Becky 
Martinez, who expects calls from irate viewers, "and I would think that part of 
'All My Children' might be affected." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Jodi Wilgoren and Lynn Franey contributed to this story. 
What's on TV 
</P>
<P>
 How television will cover the events surrounding the Nixon funeral as well as 
the funeral itself: 
</P>
<P>
 * Casket arrival: The three major networks and CNN will air live special 
reports when Nixon's casket leaves Stewart Air National Guard Base, in 
Newburgh, N.Y., about 6:45 a.m., and again when it arrives at El Toro about 
12:35 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Funeral: The networks, CNN and C-SPAN will provide live coverage of the 
funeral on Wednesday, which starts at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Local coverage: Most local network affiliates will begin programming an hour 
before the services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Public broadcasting: MacNeil/Lehrer Productions will broadcast the funeral 
live but does not plan live coverage of today's events.

 "We have cherished his birth and now we will tend his memory with warm and 
loving hands forever."  
</P>
<P>
 -- from a poem by Yorba Linda Mayor Barbara Kiley 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once again this sleepy, suburban community will be inundated by a presidential 
motorcade, Secret Service, VIP limos and TV satellite trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Not since the funeral of Pat Nixon last year and the opening of President 
Richard Nixon's library in 1990 have Yorba Linda's 57,000 residents endured 
such tumult. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, we've lost one of the world's best statesmen," Yorba Linda 
Councilman Mark Schwing said. "But what an event to put Yorba Linda on the map 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of locals have volunteered to assist at the viewing and funeral for 
Nixon, helping with traffic, parking and welcoming hundreds of invited guests 
at the burial Wednesday at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurants, floral shops and many other businesses near the library have 
become headquarters for information and rumors. They are doing booming 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Mayor Barbara Kiley has gotten caught up in the frenzy, drafting an ode 
to Nixon. Kiley and the City Council will preside at a brief, private 
wreath-laying ceremony at 5 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city was prepared for a lot of publicity, but we weren't prepared for 
something this large to go on this long," Kiley said, referring to news crews 
that arrived at the library as early as last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor wonders how her town will survive all the hoopla, which will include 
the firing of cannons as part of the state funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want these cannons roaring every half-hour because there's too many 
horses in Yorba Linda," said Kiley, who will attempt to stop the cannons' roar. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiley's phone has been ringing off the hook. She has been called by newspapers 
from around the world, she said, and has already been the subject of numerous 
TV interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had this Chinese newspaper call my home," Kiley said. "I said hello in 
Chinese. He said hello in Chinese. I said hello again in Chinese. And it fell 
apart after that." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Daniel T. Welch hasn't been able to contact the library 
because the telephone line has been so busy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had heard that hotels everywhere are booked, and that there are no rooms 
available within many miles," he said. "It is a moment in the world spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly not a time for celebration," Welch said, "but with the number 
of well-known people that are apparently going to attend, there is a certain 
excitement." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwing, who was to travel to Florida this week on business, said he changed 
his plans for the events. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Yorba Linda's favorite son is buried, the city may not be the same. It is 
a relatively small place where folks raised families and stayed. Christine 
Norris, 51, recalled her great-grandmother and Nixon's mother were friends. 
She's heard lots of Nixon stories in her time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very saddened by his death. He definitely will be missed," said Norris, 
who will help direct traffic Wednesday as a member of Yorba Linda Citizens 
Action Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt safe knowing he was in the background working on foreign 
affairs," she said. "I don't know if I'll be able to control my emotions on 
Wednesday. But I'm eager to be there and working and paying my respects." 
</P>
<P>
 Norris remembers being detained by the Secret Service at a rally for Nixon. 
She was dressed as a minuteman and carried a fake rifle that caught the eye of 
a Secret Service bodyguard. She was later released, but missed the rally.

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; O.C.'S CHIEF OF PROTOCOL IN COMMAND PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The phone buzzes for what must be the thousandth time, and Gayle Anderson 
pulls off a gold earring, pins the receiver with her shoulder and listens to 
someone, somewhere, who wants something now. 
</P>
<P>
 It is early Monday morning and already scores of Post-It notes and scraps of 
paper cover her cherrywood desk -- clues to the hectic pace of the previous few 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 For Anderson, being chief of protocol in the county hosting the funeral of 
Richard Nixon means that for the next few days she must be all things to all 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 As the official host, she is akin to an attorney arguing before the U.S. 
Supreme Court or an aerospace engineer walking on the moon. Opportunities like 
this don't come along very often, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to coordinate ambassadors arriving and parking passes and tickets, 
and I've got 14 lines on hold and people in my office," Anderson said, pausing 
to catch her breath. "This is just phenomenal. I can't even say I'm taking this 
a day at a time. I'm taking things a moment at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 Under normal circumstances, Anderson's duties amount to hosting a foreign 
dignitary to Orange County once, maybe twice a month. There would be a 
presentation before the Orange County Board of Supervisors, a trip to the Nixon 
Library & Birthplace and maybe an introduction to some local business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is a global gathering of Russians and Chinese, Japanese and 
Pakistanis, Swiss and Spaniards, Paraguayans and Poles. Anderson is no novice 
when it comes to foreign ministries and consuls general, but when they are 
coming by the dozens and all on the same day, it is a little much to 
coordinate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spend a lot of time getting dignitaries who come to Los Angeles not to skip 
over us in Orange County on their way to San Diego," she said. "But I could 
never imagine all these heads of state at once. Orange County will soon be 
known in the entire global community." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, 51, has been in the volunteer job for nearly two years after being 
appointed by the Board of Supervisors. The office's budget is paid by the 
International Visitors and Protocol Foundation of Orange County. Its members, 
individuals and corporations, created the foundation as a way to bring foreign 
diplomats to the county, and, they hope, create goodwill among local and 
foreign businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Located in the county's Hall of Administration in Santa Ana, the 10-year-old 
office hosts more than 300 yearly visitors, usually sent by the U.S. 
Information Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month, consuls general representing more than 40 countries attended 
a $150-per-person International Protocol Ball that brought the foundation more 
than $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting together that event was a feat, but ordering limos, hotel rooms and 
getting parking places for the Nixon funeral is even more daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unbelievable," Anderson said. "I've never had such responsibility in all 
my life." 
</P>
<P>
 The call about Nixon's death came Friday, from the U.S. Department of 
Protocol, and Anderson was immediately on the phone to a dozen hotels, blocking 
out rooms. On Saturday, she sent information to Washington, including room 
rates and availability, transportation options and maps of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, she was up at Los Angeles International Airport, picking up the 
seven-member federal protocol team. Anderson is more or less assisting them as 
they get updated guest lists from foreign representatives and set up 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Molly Raiser, chief of protocol in the State Department in Washington, said 
Orange County's protocol office has performed "wonderfully" these past few 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're helping with getting transportation for people, getting the diplomats 
back and forth to the library, getting together possible hotels," she said. "It 
helps, because they know the local scene." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, though tired, Anderson -- fashionably attired in a red suit with 
black trim and a black straw hat -- was polite to a fault and kept her good 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, there isn't time to show much individual, personalized hospitality to 
the foreign outsiders, but she does have one goal in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even under these sad circumstances, we want people to go away with a positive 
feeling about Orange County," she said.

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; SAN CLEMENTE AND WHITTIER WILL HOLD NIXON MEMORIALS;

 Admirers of Richard Nixon who want to avoid the crowds in Yorba Linda can 
attend one of two smaller memorial gatherings being held today in San Clemente 
and Whittier, two other Southern California communities that claim a special 
affection for the former President. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Clemente, the site of Nixon's former Western White House, a local 
museum will hold an exhibit of mementos from his long political career. 
</P>
<P>
 The public also is invited to attend the Whittier College Nixon Hometown 
Memorial at 12:30 p.m. on the campus that was Nixon's alma mater. Nixon's 
younger brother Edward, 63, a cousin and four of the former President's 
Whittier College classmates who had remained his close friends are among those 
scheduled to offer eulogies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want this to be a very warm, heartfelt memorial and not a political 
event," said college spokeswoman Leslie Baer-Brown. She said the college 
rejected offers from several congressmen who wanted to speak at the memorial, 
but didn't know Nixon personally. 
</P>
<P>
 The invocation at the memorial will be given by T. Eugene Coffin, former 
pastor of East Whittier Friends Church where Nixon was a member. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nixon was born in Yorba Linda, his family moved to Whittier when he 
was nine years old and he grew up in the town, attending Whittier High School 
and working after school in his parents' grocery store. After graduating from 
high school, he enrolled at Whittier College, where his mother and several 
aunts and uncles had gone before him. 
</P>
<P>
 At Whittier College, Nixon was a history major, served as student body 
president, played football, co-founded a fraternal society, wrote for the 
school newspaper and was an activist who worked to lift bans the Quaker 
institution had on dancing and smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Whittier College family has always claimed him," said Marygene Wright, 
Nixon's cousin, who will be among a number of Nixon relatives attending the 
Whittier College memorial. Clint Harris, a classmate of the former President, 
said that Nixon had attended his 25th, 45th and 50th class reunions. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never lost his love for his old friends and for the little college he went 
to," said Harris, recalling that Nixon served many years on the Whittier 
College Board of Trustees and was a generous financial supporter of the 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 Baer-Brown said college officials originally intended to hold a private 
ceremony, but changed their minds when they were "flooded with calls starting 
the day after he died from people who wanted to participate in some sort of 
memorial. Some were upset that the (funeral) service at the (Nixon Library) was 
going to be private." 
</P>
<P>
 If skies are clear, Baer-Brown said, the memorial will be held at the 
college's 3,000-seat Amphitheater. But if it rains, she said, equal seating 
will be offered at the gymnasium, called the Graham Activities Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who attend the college memorial event also will have a rare opportunity 
to view a collection of gifts the Nixons received from people around the world 
and then donated to the college. The collection is kept in the Nixon Room of 
the Bell Wardman Library. The room usually is closed to the public for security 
reasons, Baer-Brown said. But today, she said, the display will be open between 
11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. and between 1:30 and 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Clemente, the seaside town where Nixon vacationed during his presidency 
and recuperated after the Watergate scandal, the local historic society is 
planning a special show of Nixon memorabilia today at Casa Romantica. The 
Spanish-style villa at 415 Avenida Granada was the home of the city's founder, 
Ole Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente Historic Society President Dorothy Fuller said the Nixon 
artifacts are exhibited on Tuesdays and Thursdays between 1 and 4 p.m. But this 
week, the museum will be specially decorated with bouquets, including yellow 
roses that were Pat Nixon's favorites. She also said refreshments will be 
offered and docents will greet guests and ask them to sign the visitors' book 
that will be marked to record those who came to remember the former President. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller said that at first members of the historic society had planned to 
arrange car pools to take San Clemente residents to today's memorial ceremonies 
at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when we found out we could not park any closer than about four blocks 
from the library and that we would have to stand at a distance from the 
activities where we wouldn't be able to see anything, we decided to double our 
efforts to invite people to our museum," she said.

FIXATIONS / JIM WASHBURN: 'PLACE' MAKER DOES HIS HEART GOOD; CREATOR-HOST FRED 
BERGENDORFF'S HOBBY AND PET PROJECT IS AN ANAHEIM-PRODUCED TV SHOW ON KDOC THAT 
FEATURES ADOPTABLE DOGS AND CATS FROM AREA SHELTERS.

<P>
 The waiting area for Fred Bergendorff's TV guests doesn't quite compare to the 
"Tonight Show's." Rather than getting to spend their nervous preshow moments 
sequestered in a greenroom filled with chic furniture, TV monitors and heaped 
deli trays, there is merely a riser of tired brown carpet for them to lounge 
on, off to the left of the spare set. 
</P>
<P>
 But Leno and Letterman's guests are never so pampered: Each of Bergendorff's 
is being stroked, coddled, massaged and cooed to by an attendant. Some guests 
roll over, shameless as Madonna, offering their bellies to be rubbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Then some chirpy disco-lite music starts up, a couple of the guests join in 
with a high pitched whine -- like the dogs they are -- and another segment of 
"The Pet Place" begins taping. 
</P>
<P>
 Creator-host Bergendorff earns his keep working behind the scenes in the radio 
industry, as promotion director for KNX 1070 news radio, but on-camera he has 
the assured manner of a Casey Kasem or Dick Clark, not to mention, at 50, the 
latter's timeless hair. He wears a white ribbon on his crew-neck sweater. It's 
something he originated, intended to convey the message: "Be Kind to Animals." 
</P>
<P>
 For a pet lover, "The Pet Place" might be the best gig in the world: In his 
half-hour show -- aired on KDOC Channel 56 every Saturday at 6 p.m. and Sunday 
at 6 a.m. -- Bergendorff's job, in essence, is to pet cats and dogs. Volunteers 
carry them on one by one, and Bergendorff pets them. 
</P>
<P>
 It's petting with a purpose, though. The animal guests, usually a dozen per 
show, all come from Southland animal shelters and desperately need homes. "The 
Pet Place" does remarkably well at getting them homes. At this particular 
taping, last Thursday at KDOC's Anaheim studios, the show celebrated its 
three-year anniversary on the station, and its 4,000th pet adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 The anniversary program, which aired the last weekend, was practically a 
spectacular, featuring balloons, a cake, a citation from the city of Los 
Angeles, as well as a plaque from the show's sponsor, Jonny Cat, purveyors of 
fine cat-box filler. Indeed, a costume-character Jonny Cat himself put in an 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually there isn't so much icing.  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't go heavy on entertainment here," Bergendorff said. "Nothing should 
upstage the animals. They're the stars. I like doing it this intense way, where 
we showcase many animals in every show, and talk about the important aspects of 
pet care, without a lot of flash." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the set looks like it cost all of $35. There's a sign, and a carpeted 
table, on which the furry guests sit, usually, while Bergendorff introduces 
them to the home audience and gives out their kennel number and shelter at 
which they might be found. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, a pet will bolt. One particularly large dog once took the table 
over with him. Sometimes there are what they genteelly refer to as "accidents." 
As is inevitable with the volume of animals they've had on the show, a couple 
of helpers have been nipped or clawed in the guests' nervousness.  
</P>
<P>
 At this taping, one would swear many of the animals were experiencing stage 
fright. Bergendorff explained: "They might think they're at the vet's, but it's 
also a situation they've never encountered before, with all the bright lights. 
If they get jumpy, that's all part of the experience for us, and people are 
willing to go through that to give these animals a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 He's never been bitten, or even gotten fleas from his guests, though he does 
get more dog kisses in an evening than many folks get in a lifetime. "But one 
hazard of this job is the dry-cleaning bills," he said. "I can only wear things 
one time before they have to go in again." 
</P>
<P>
 They tape every other week, two shows a night. Most of the animals are of 
mixed breeds. "He's a schnauzer, possibly," opined one shelter rep of the dog 
he'd brought to the show. And so it proceeds, with Bergendorff's sweater 
picking up hairs from semi-spaniels, shepherds, Airedales, terriers and various 
cats. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the animals are handicapped. Along with a deaf purebred Brittany 
spaniel, Eileen Pinder of the Huntington Beach-based Orange County Humane 
Society brought on Emma, a dog that had been at her shelter for 2 1/2 months. 
Though blind, she still had eyes that said "love me," and it is the show's 
getting that look into people's homes that will probably place Emma in one of 
those homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's please be responsible pet owners," Pinder reminded the audience. "It 
was pouring rain when Emma was found wandering." 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't that terrible?" Bergendorff commented, with genuine concern. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bergendorff has loved animals since he had pets as a kid. "And I've read all 
the books, 'Lassie,' 'Lad, a Dog,' and probably seen every pet movie that's 
ever been out. We had the animal stars of 'Homeward Bound, the Incredible 
Journey' come on the show. It was terrific. I don't know how I feel about human 
stars, but I was in awe of these animal stars. That's a favorite movie of 
mine." 
</P>
<P>
 He only has one pet of his own at present, a Maine Coon cat, but he also feeds 
a group of strays that live near his Long Beach home. It was one of these 
strays that led him to where he is now.  
</P>
<P>
 "One day in late 1989, this one little cute black cat from the group 
disappeared, and some people told me they thought it had been taken to the Long 
Beach animal shelter. Going there was the most important trip of my life, 
because it made me aware of the tremendous pet overpopulation problem the 
animal shelters are dealing with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He proposed to the shelter that he feature some of their animals on a local 
access cable show. He began doing that, and still does, and after a year began 
also doing the expanded version of the show on commercial station KDOC. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been a few rabbits, snakes and iguanas on the show, but nothing 
more exotic. "We encourage people not to get that kind of animal, because 
exotic animals belong in exotic places, not people's homes. By far, we feature 
cats and dogs because that's where the tragic pet overpopulation is that we try 
to address. There are between 15 and 25 million euthanized a year. Whatever the 
number, it's tragic to comprehend. We can't do anything about the rest of the 
country, but we can certainly do our best for our area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With no shortage of his own species suffering in the world, why does he feel 
drawn to animals?  
</P>
<P>
 "For me, one thing is that they can't speak for themselves. They have no 
voice, so some person needs to be the voice for them. And they look so in need 
of love and homes. They're so trusting. Give them a little food and take care 
of them and they give all this love back in return." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The show alternately features animals from 22 Southland shelters. Some 96% of 
the animals featured become adopted, and he says that rate is 100% for the 
typically hard-to-place handicapped pets that Bergendorff makes a special 
effort in presenting. Some lucky times, owners see their missing pets on the 
show and are reunited. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4,000 featured pets that were adopted don't tell the whole story of the 
show's success. "The estimate we get from the shelters is that overall possibly 
as many as 15,000 animals have found homes because of the show. There's a 
reason why we do the show the way we do: People can't call in to adopt a pet; 
they have to go to the shelter. We know they'll be in the mind to get a pet 
when they go down, and if eight people go down interested in a dog that was on 
the show, maybe six of them will go home with other ones." 
</P>
<P>
 "This show has helped us tremendously," says the Humane Society's Pinder. 
"Almost 100% of the animals we feature here find homes. I don't know what I 
could do for a lot of our handicapped pets without 'The Pet Place.' It's when 
they see them here on the show that a lot of viewers feel in their hearts that 
they can take on that responsibility. Without that visual tool, a lot of them 
would not have gotten homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergendorff estimates his show draws 40,000 to 50,000 viewers, and he has 
derived some small amount of celebrity from it. "I was at Disneyland a couple 
of weeks ago, and three different people recognized me, stopped me and said 
they enjoy the show. Another came up to me in San Diego yesterday."  
</P>
<P>
 He also makes personal appearances at pet shows, where often several hundred 
people will stop to talk to him. "Some want reassurance that all these animals 
do get taken care of. Some just want to talk or show me pictures of their cats 
and dogs. Some have adopted our pets and want to share how they're doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd had one beautiful German shepherd named King on, who'd lived in Big 
Bear. One night a drunk in a bar had shot him and he lost a leg because of this 
cruel act. He ran out into the snow, and there were heroic efforts of the 
community for days to find him. We had him on and this wonderful family adopted 
him, and they came out to a personal appearance I made and showed me pictures 
of King in the swimming pool with the family. I love things like that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the people involved in the show volunteer their services, including 
Bergendorff and co-producers Missy Will and Gary Lycan. "We're lucky if we get 
our expenses covered," Bergendorff said. They recently received nonprofit 
status, using donations to defray production costs. (You can call Elevad 
Productions, (310) 594-9244.) 
</P>
<P>
 He says his devoted producers make his work on the show as easy as possible, 
and given his druthers, he'd tape it every week. Despite working full time, 
teaching broadcast marketing part time at San Diego State University and doing 
everything tied to the show (it's not just personal appearances; they've 
organized emergency aid for animals following earthquakes, riots and other 
disasters), Bergendorff claims he's not a workaholic. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you love something a lot, it's not an effort. Even if I've had a bad 
week, my eyes light up when I meet the animals. It makes you feel that it's 
important and you're helping, making a difference. That's such a high that I 
can't see myself ever not doing it."

ANN CONWAY: NEWPORT HARBOR HONORS MODEST EFFORT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Contemporary art collector Jack Shea tried to stay in the shadows Sunday night 
when the Newport Harbor Art Museum honored him and his wife, Marion, at its 
seventh annual Art of Dining benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the stage before hundreds of guests at the Four Seasons Hotel in 
Newport Beach, the museum's former chairman dodged the spotlight as museum 
president Joan Beall sang his praises and presented him with an etched crystal 
bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "C'mon, Jack," whispered his wife, coaxing him to step forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical Jack Shea -- the humble arts visionary who for 20 years has provided 
museum leadership and underwritten many of the facility's primo exhibitions, 
including the acclaimed "Edvard Munch," "Six in Bronze," "the Second Newport 
Biennal" and "American Abstraction from the Addison Collection of American 
Art." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are honored -- thank you for having noticed," said Shea, owner of Beacon 
Bay Enterprises in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 During the $300-per-person dinner, a six-course festival of light French 
cuisine, Marion warned Jack that she was going to speak when they were honored. 
("Don't," he begged his vivacious wife. "Yes, yes, I will -- you deserve it, 
Jack!" said Marion, who wore a black sequin sheath and tailored jacket.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I must say something," she told the black-tie crowd. "I want to tell you from 
my heart how much I appreciate you honoring Jack. And it was so nice of you to 
put my name on it, too. It's very special to us. We wish you all love." 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the table, Jack Shea -- whose Palm Springs digs are plastered with the 
masters of contemporary art (Stella, Diebenkorn, et al.) -- spoke, albeit 
reluctantly, about his collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy it -- that's the sum and substance of it," he said. "I enjoy living 
with it, looking at it." 
</P>
<P>
 And his love of the museum? "I'm not closely involved with it now, so I can 
say this with some objectivity: Orange County is lucky to have this museum. 
They are really lucky. There have been good times and bad, but all told, it 
adds a great deal to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Museum director Michael Botwinick launched the festivities, telling guests he 
would be their culinary guide for the evening. "This is not usually my 
function; I usually get to have fun at these," he said. "But our great friend 
Michael Mondavi is in Florida. He sent his regrets . . . but more importantly, 
he sent his wine." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. There was so much grape at the affair that Botwinick cautioned guests 
not to drink too much. "Decide who's going to drive your table home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Net event proceeds, which included a live auction, were estimated at $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Also among guests: gala chairwoman Alison Baker Frenzel with her husband, Bud; 
Art of Dining founder Sam Goldstein with his 
</P>
<P>
 wife, Pam (who sported a huge amethyst pendant. "I got this (at the Art of 
Dining auction) the year Danny and Susie Hernandez were here," she said. "Susie 
wanted it, but Sam got it for me because it was our anniversary"); Donald 
Beall, CEO of Rockwell; Kathryn Thompson and Gus Owen (who is about to be 
appointed an interstate commerce commissioner by President Clinton. "There's a 
good possibility I'll be going to Washington this week," he said), and Tom and 
Marilyn Nielsen. 
</P>
<P>
 Gala committee members included Ronnie Allumbaugh, E.G. Chamberlin, Annette 
Harzan, Pat Neisser, Susan Porter, Peg Reday and Nancy Sheffner. Also on the 
committee were Jan Seitz, Lola Seymour, Margaret Sprague, Jennifer Van Bergh 
and Socorro Vasquez.

 Arts budget -- Friday's Morning Report incorrectly indicated that a state 
Senate subcommittee has recommended elimination of the California Arts Council 
budget. Although the budget has been targeted for elimination in the past, the 
CAC this year has been asked to present the Senate subcommittee with 
information from an internal economic impact study. The subcommittee is 
scheduled to review that information on Wednesday before taking any action.

THE TIMES 100 / THE BEST PERFORMING COMPANIES IN AMERICA; THE BOTTOM LINE; 
NETWORKING HAS TIED THINGS UP NICELY FOR CISCO SYSTEMS; THERE DON'T SEEM TO BE 
ENOUGH SUPERLATIVES TO DESCRIBE THE MAKER OF COMPUTER ROUTING BOXES, WHICH HAS 
A STOCK MARKET VALUE OF $8.6 BILLION.

<P>
 Haul out all the cliches about Silicon Valley's abundant success stories and 
they still won't do justice to Cisco Systems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 10 years old, the sibilant manufacturer of computer networking gear 
cries out for new superlatives to describe its achievements: a routine doubling 
of annual sales and profit, four stock splits in as many years, extraordinary 
productivity ($500,000 per employee), a rocket-like ascent among investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Little wonder that Cisco perches near the top of three of The Times 100's key 
measures of corporate performance in 1993: fourth in two-year return on equity, 
sixth in sales growth and 12th in market value. As of April 8, the company's 
$8.6-billion stock market value, half again as large as last year's, shoved it 
ahead in its value to investors of much larger California stalwarts, including 
Gap Inc., Unocal Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisco's feats are all the more remarkable given that its name is unlikely to 
crop up in household chatter. The company makes routers -- boxes of varying 
size containing software that links disparate groups of computers, a technology 
of increasing importance given the emphasis on inter-networking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cisco hit the wave perfectly," said Donald T. Valentine, chairman of Cisco 
and general partner with Sequoia Capital, a venture capital firm that invested 
in Cisco. "It had the product needed and wanted by the market." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the 1980s, companies began to replace systems using giant mainframes 
and simple video display, or "dumb," terminals with groups of personal 
computers that could communicate with one another. A problem soon arose: A 
group of IBM-compatible PCs could not hook up easily with, say, a network of 
Apple Macintoshes or a bunch of Sun Microsystems workstations. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Leonard Bosack and Sandra Lerner, computer networking technologists (and 
spouses) from Stanford University. With three like-minded friends and funds 
borrowed on their credit cards, they founded Cisco (named for that cosmopolitan 
neighbor to the north, San Francisco) to develop and build one product. This 
router would speak several computer languages and thus connect a company's 
various networks, whether from across a room or across an ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of a computer network as a congested freeway. Cisco's data delivery 
technology determines the best route for information to travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its founding, Cisco has sold more than 150,000 routers, ranging in price 
from $2,000 to $100,000. That range has broadened as companies have clamored 
for more affordable devices on the low end and more powerful ones on the high 
end. Cisco dominates the high- and mid-range markets but has recently begun 
pushing into the low end, where most of the sector's growth is expected over 
the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of every four Fortune 100 companies use Cisco's technology. Customers 
include Wal-Mart, Aetna Insurance and NASA.  
</P>
<P>
 When aircraft giant Boeing set out to design its new 777 jet entirely on 
computers, it bought Cisco routers to connect thousands of computers, printers 
and other devices. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisco, which went public in 1990, controls half the global market for routers, 
which in 1993 soared to $1.9 billion from $1 billion the year before, said 
Rebecca Thompson, an analyst at Dataquest, a San Jose market research firm.  
</P>
<P>
 Wellfleet Communications Inc., Cisco's nearest competitor, has 10% of the U.S. 
market compared to Cisco's 44%.  
</P>
<P>
 Having outgrown offices in Menlo Park, where Cisco assembles the routers, the 
company is relocating to a six-building complex 10 miles south in San Jose. 
John P. Morgridge, president and chief executive, admits to being leery of the 
Silicon Valley jinx of high-flying companies moving into handsome new quarters 
and suddenly finding themselves in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The saving grace, Valentine said, is that these buildings are "plain vanilla," 
with no fancy swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgridge, a lean man who jogs daily, topped a recent Business Week list of 
executives who give shareholders the most for their money. His pay over the 
last three years totaled $967,000 -- a pittance by the standards of CEOs of 
most big companies. 
</P>
<P>
 But keep this in mind: When Morgridge took the job six years ago, he exercised 
options to buy Cisco shares at 3.3 cents each. What cost him $25,000 then is 
now worth about $177 million.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Cisco's sales leaped to $928.2 million and net income soared to $241 
million. Both represented near doublings of the previous year's levels. The 
payroll has grown to more than 2,000 from 300 three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its current dominance, Cisco faces big challenges in a fast-changing 
environment. Key will be making headway with low-end products in such 
competitive, price-conscious markets as schools and homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest problem will be striving to meet investors' inflated 
expectations. Cisco realizes that its stellar performance of recent years will 
be a tough act to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts expect the company to continue its strong growth, if at a 
somewhat slower pace. And Morgridge contends that Cisco is always glancing over 
its shoulder.

THE TIMES 100 / THE BEST PERFORMING COMPANIES IN AMERICA; THE BOTTOM LINE; 
TIMES 100 PERFORMERS SYMBOLIZE A NEW VIGOR; CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC STIRRING IS 
EVIDENT IN THE SUCCESS STORIES OF ITS TOP-RANKED COMPANIES. 
</P>

<P>
 Although obituaries for the Great California Recession are just now beginning 
to appear, an increasing number of companies in the state were already posting 
healthy and improving returns for their shareholders last year. 
</P>
<P>
 As a whole, The Times 100 -- a ranking of companies that turned in the best 
performances for their shareholders -- rose for the second consecutive year in 
1993 to its highest level since 1988 based on the median performance of firms 
on the list. While this alone is inconclusive proof of the state's improving 
fortunes, some economists note that the results buttress other evidence that 
California's economy is awakening. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man on the street might not feel it yet, because employment is still 
depressed, but we passed the trough of the recession, probably in January," 
said Jack Kyser, chief economist with the Economic Development Corp. of Los 
Angeles County. "I think that by 1995 we'll be able to say, 'We're back.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Times 100 ranks companies by two-year average return on equity, a ratio 
produced by dividing average common shareholder equity in a company into its 
annual profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Topping the list this year is Inglewood-based Herbalife International Inc., a 
controversial marketing company that for the past several years has enjoyed one 
of the fastest revenue growth rates among publicly held companies in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The dietary and nutritional supplements company posted an eye-popping 142.2% 
two-year average return on shareholder equity, nearly 2 1/2 times the results 
of the company in the No. 2 spot, Callaway Golf Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The score is also more than twice the 66.6% average return produced by last 
year's No. 1, Total Pharmaceutical Care Inc., a Torrance provider of in-home 
drug treatments that has since been acquired by Abbey Healthcare Group Inc., 
the company in the No. 3 spot on this year's Times 100 list. 
</P>
<P>
 Herbalife sells its products through a network of independent distributors, 
who in turn sell directly to consumers. It is a marketing system that has 
raised regulatory eyebrows in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years ago, Herbalife, then privately held, was for 18 months the subject 
of state and federal investigations into its direct-marketing arrangements and 
the veracity of claims made for some of its diet products. In October, 1986, 
the company agreed to pay the state $850,000 to settle all outstanding 
allegations, without admitting wrongdoing. State and federal regulators say 
there are no further actions or investigations pending. 
</P>
<P>
 While much of the company's sales growth in recent years has occurred outside 
the United States, last year's growth was attributable in part to strong U.S. 
sales of a new weight-loss product, Thermojetics. The product is based on a 
Chinese herb, ma huang, which contains small amounts of natural ephedrine, an 
alkaloid that constricts blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
 Diet aids containing that herb are being studied by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration. J. Mark Hattendorf, the company's chief financial officer, said 
the review was not aimed specifically at Herbalife, adding, "We feel very 
comfortable the product is safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Herbalife's performance dramatically outpaced that of the other 
companies named on the list, the rankings offer ample additional evidence of 
the improving fortunes of California companies. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the median two-year return on equity in 1993 rose to 22.5% from 
19.4% the previous year. In 1991, it was 17.7%, its lowest level ever.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a total of 25 companies had a two-year return on equity of more 
than 30% last year; that compares to 16 companies posting such a figure in 1992 
and 17 firms in 1990, when the state's economy was at a peak, according to data 
compiled by Star Services, a San Francisco business research firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The other companies topping the Times 100 reflect the great emerging business 
opportunities in the nation and underscore the large part these industries play 
in the California economy. Five of the top 10 companies are in health-related 
fields, two are involved in computer software. One makes sporting equipment, 
one is a retailer, and one is a chemical manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 To be named to the Times 100 list, a company must be based in California and 
have annual sales of more than $50 million. Its stock must have been traded 
publicly since December, 1992, on one of the major exchanges. The company 
cannot be a real estate investment trust or a limited partnership. Its 
long-term, debt-to-equity ratio must be less than 4 to 1, and it must not have 
reported a negative common shareholders' equity for either of the last two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies ranked in the top five of The Times 100: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 2. Callaway Golf Co.: Over the last 10 years, this Carlsbad-based company has 
burst onto the sporting scene with its wildly popular Big Bertha line of metal 
wood golf clubs. These oversized clubs, whose irreverent name was borrowed from 
a German cannon used during World War I, have a large "sweet spot" that makes 
them popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales last year were $254.6 million, and profit was $41.2 million. The company 
is named for Ely Callaway, a former textile chieftain who came to the Temecula 
Valley, north of San Diego, in the early 1970s to operate a winery that still 
bears his name. After building a nationally renowned winery in what was a 
small, little-known grape region, Callaway sold the business to Hiram Walker & 
Sons in 1981. A few years later, he invested in a struggling Palm Springs 
manufacturer of golf clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which first sold shares to the public in early 1992, is making 
its first appearance on The Times 100. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 3. Abbey Healthcare Group Inc.: Thanks to an ambitious decision last year to 
acquire Total Pharmaceutical Care Inc. in Torrance, this Costa Mesa provider of 
at-home care services is making its debut on The Times 100. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbey, which has 200 offices in 45 states, supplies medical equipment and 
respiratory, nutritional and infusion therapies for patients in their homes. It 
is the nation's third-largest home medical supplier, and many industry analysts 
believe it will prosper from efforts by government, employers and insurers to 
reduce medical costs by taking such steps as cutting hospital stays.  
</P>
<P>
 Abbey's roots go back more than 60 years, when it was known as Abbey Rents and 
leased a wide range of equipment. Last year, the company had sales of $380 
million and profit of $14.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 4. Cisco Systems Inc.: The Menlo Park company enjoys a spot in the fast lane 
of the emerging information superhighway. As a supplier of computer networking 
equipment -- its hardware and software link groups of computers -- Cisco has 
benefited from growing demand for products that help companies connect computer 
users within an organization and tie them into the fast-growing Internet data 
network. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisco likes to think of itself as providing the "interchanges" and "on-ramps" 
along the data superhighway, and it recognizes that as traffic increases along 
these networks, demand for its products will rise. "We like to say the more 
bits the better," marketing director Jeff Paine said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company earned $241 million on revenue of $928 million last year. This is 
its second year on The Times 100; it ranked No. 2 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 5. Informix Corp.: The Menlo Park software publisher is making its second 
consecutive appearance on The Times 100. The company, which specializes in 
database software for businesses, enjoyed its best year ever in 1993, earning 
$56.1 million on revenue of nearly $353 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's software is used by a variety of businesses, especially the 
hospitality and retail industries. Informix was No. 3 on last year's Times 100. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which was founded in 1980, provides software that works on every 
type of computer, from mainframe to desktop, through a direct-sales network and 
small computer resellers that tailor the programs to serve individual 
companies. It has about 1,700 employees worldwide. The Times 100

 There's nothing like a resurrection story to get an investor's pulse jumping, 
and there were some doozies in 1993, led by the glitz of gold and the lure of 
dinosaur-generating computers. 
</P>
<P>
 High on the list of those that rose Lazarus-like in 1993 were several 
companies with operations that were anything but moribund but whose balance 
sheets were afflicted by huge non-recurring charges in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the swing from chump to champ is a pretty pleasant one, most 
companies would agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like people to stand up and brag about us because they were kicking 
us pretty hard a few years ago," said Homestake Mining spokeswoman Janet Bley. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are California's top five turnaround companies, ranked according to their 
change from loss to profit in one year, as compiled by Star Services, a San 
Francisco business research firm. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 1. Homestake Mining of San Francisco, one of the world's largest gold 
producers, reported net income of $51 million in 1993, contrasted with a loss 
of $175.8 million the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 The red ink of 1992 reflected $146.9 million in charges, including write-downs 
of assets from Homestake's acquisition that year of International Corona Corp., 
as well as business combination and restructuring costs. 
</P>
<P>
 After the acquisition, Homestake combined offices, closed facilities and 
reduced corporate staff by 60%, Bley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The restructuring began to pay off in the reduced cost of production, she 
said, followed by the lucky coincidence of gold prices that rose $11 an ounce 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were assisted by gold prices, but that wasn't the real fuel in the 
engine," Bley said. "We worked very hard at it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 2. Silicon Graphics, a Mountain View-based computer maker whose machines 
helped create some of the most boffo special effects in the mega-hit movies 
"Jurassic Park" and "Terminator 2," posted net income of $114.7 million last 
year, contrasted with a loss of $74.4 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Results in 1992 were hurt by Silicon Graphics' purchase of troubled MIPS 
Computer Systems, its main supplier of computer chips. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had not merged, we would have had a pretty good profit in '92," Silicon 
Graphics spokeswoman Rosanne Siino said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Silicon Graphics rolled out a slew of new, cheaper products, which 
boosted market share, revenue and earnings. Earnings were also aided by 
controlled operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 3. LSI Logic Corp., a Milpitas-based maker of tailor-made chips called 
application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, reported 1993 income of 
$53.8 million, contrasted with a loss of $110.2 million in 1992. The company, 
plagued with too much idle factory space, restructured in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty clear that the company would have to reinvent itself," 
spokesman Tom Mahon said. 
</P>
<P>
 LSI closed a factory and eliminated more than 1,000 jobs, resulting in a 
$102-million charge against 1992 earnings. The moves created substantial 
savings in operating expenses, Mahon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The year 1993 brought an upswing in the cyclical semiconductor industry and 
aggressive product introductions from LSI. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 4. Chiron Corp., an Emeryville-based biotechnology company specializing in 
products to diagnose and fight diseases, posted income of $18.4 million in 
1993, contrasted with a loss of $92.6 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss in 1992 included charges related to acquisitions, while results in 
1993 benefited from increased demand for new Chiron products. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 5. Unilab Corp., a Tarzana-based provider of clinical laboratory testing 
services, reported income of $6.5 million in 1993, contrasted with a loss of 
$100.1 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Results for 1992 included $78 million in non-recurring charges from 
acquisitions and a colossal billing foul-up that cost the company $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real challenge for us to climb out of that hole we had fallen into," 
Chief Financial Officer Richard A. Michaelson said. "But the size of the loss 
was really not representative of ongoing operations." 
</P>
<P>
 Unilab reorganized in 1993, selling its non-California operations to Corning 
Inc., which assumed $70 million of the company's $95-million debt and retained 
a 12% stake in Unilab. Corning handed over J.S. Pathology, a clinical 
laboratory in the United Kingdom. Unilab also worked to control expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "To some extent, the company has had the benefit of starting over," Michaelson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Results for 1993 included a pretax charge of $5.6 million from the settlement 
of government charges that a Unilab unit and another large clinical lab filed 
thousands of false Medicare claims for unnecessary blood tests. Born Again

THE TIMES 100 / THE BEST PERFORMING COMPANIES IN AMERICA; THE BOTTOM LINE; 
SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST; BANKS THAT MADE IT THROUGH RECESSION ARE STRONGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Consolidation and failures during the past decade may have radically reduced 
the number of California's banks and savings and loans, but those that remain 
are generally healthy -- and getting stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a measure of how deep a hole the state's financial services industry was 
in that only one California-based financial institution, CVB Financial of 
Ontario, appears on The Times 100 list of most profitable companies, a ranking 
that charts average two-year return on shareholder equity. 
</P>
<P>
 That dearth does not diminish the accomplishment of the state's surviving 
banks and thrifts -- many of them small -- that have bounced back from 
recession to carve out roles in the rapidly changing financial services 
industry.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, CVB Financial, parent of 16-branch Chino Valley Bank, has found a 
niche in the booming agribusiness market. The commercial bank is a lender to 
many of the 350 dairies in its market area, Chief Executive Linn Wiley said. 
For the second year in a row, CVB heads the list of the top-performing 
California banks and thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-growing GBC Bancorp, parent of General Bank of Los Angeles, which caters 
to the Chinese business community, has earned a "super premier" grade from the 
Findley Reports rating company. GBC ranks No. 3 on this year's list of most 
profitable banks and savings and loans in the state, according to data compiled 
for The Times by Star Services, a San Francisco business research company. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger institutions that prospered did so by bringing their problem-loan 
portfolios under control. In the past few years, the earnings of many of these 
companies have been pummeled by the need to set aside huge sums for bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Drastic action was usually required to achieve that end. Thrifts such as H.F. 
Ahmanson, California Federal Bank and Great Western Financial sold hundreds of 
millions of dollars' worth of non-performing assets to clean up their balance 
sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate Bank, the top-performing big bank on this year's list, got 
high marks from investors for boosting its dividend and buying back its stock, 
which pushed up its share price. 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate's profit was boosted by improved efficiency and a decreasing 
cost of funds. The bank benefits greatly from its high number of 
low-interest-bearing checking accounts, said Campbell Chaney, an analyst with 
Dakin Securities of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks generally did better throughout the state. State-chartered commercial 
banks reported aggregate profits in 1993 of nearly $2.8 billion, up 43% from 
1992, according to a survey by Sheshunoff Information Services of Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 As consolidations continued, the number of state-chartered banks shrank to 252 
at the end of 1993, from 260 a year earlier, said Stan Cardenas, chief deputy 
superintendent of the California Banking Department. The state's banks once 
numbered more than 400. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas said 1993 ended on a "hopeful note. We saw upgrades in ratings of 
individual banks. . . . Larger banks showed improved earnings, and we saw 
renewed interest by investors in either buying banks or investing new capital 
in problem banks." 
</P>
<P>
 The state's thrifts reported a decline in aggregate profit to $504 million, 
off 19% from the $620 million reported in 1992, according to the California 
League of Savings Institutions. That was largely the result of loan losses that 
typically accompanied the large thrifts' bulk sales of bad assets. Total 
thrifts also shrank to 96 as of December, down from 104 a year previous. Top 25

<TEXT>
<P>
 NOT SO LONG AGO, any talk of an economic recovery in California would probably 
have focused on the aerospace or construction industries. Or perhaps the need 
to boost international trade. But who would have thought that the seeds to the 
state's fledgling recovery would be planted in such unfamiliar soil as 
"reduced-instruction-set computing" or "non-impact printing peripherals"? 
</P>
<P>
 But it is such technology that helped Hewlett-Packard Co. boost sales by 25% 
last year and spark growth at other California computer companies, helping to 
offset sluggish sales in other industries. Hewlett-Packard's growth helped lift 
sales of the state's 100 largest publicly held companies by 2% to $385.9 
billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The modest gain bolsters the arguments of analysts who say California's long 
recession has finally ended and its economy is on the mend. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer industry accounts for nearly 30% of the companies on this year's 
Sales 100, and analysts said the strong gains they reported bode well for the 
region's future economic health. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at the industries that are really key to the future of this 
state's economy, computers are certainly near the top of the list," said Lynn 
Reaser, chief economist of Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp. 
</P>
<P>
 "High-tech is a growth industry, and it will remain so well into the 21st 
Century. I'd be concerned if our economy was more dependent on an industry 
without such a bright future," such as steelmaking or shipbuilding, Reaser 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 With U.S. corporate spending on new equipment still strong, Reaser and other 
analysts say computer makers should see continued healthy sales gains in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other California industries that didn't fare as well last year should 
also see some sales improvement as the state's economy rebounds, Reaser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewlett-Packard, a prime beneficiary of the trend toward linking business and 
personal computers in vast electronic networks, saw its sales surge to $21.4 
billion. It vaulted over Atlantic Richfield Co. to become the No. 2 sales 
company, behind perennial leader Chevron Corp., according to data compiled by 
Star Services, a San Francisco-based business research firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple Computer Inc., Intel Corp., Sun Microsystems Inc. and AST Research Inc. 
were just a few of the other high-tech companies that logged double-digit sales 
gains in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Solectron Corp. of Milpitas, which assembles circuit boards and other 
components, saw its sales skyrocket 133% -- the largest percentage gain of any 
firm on the Sales 100. The company also premiered recently as one of the 500 
largest U.S. industrial corporations in Fortune magazine's annual ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big Oil" got a little smaller in 1993, as prices sank to about $14 a barrel 
by the end of the year from $20 a barrel earlier. Sales fell 6% at Chevron, 2% 
at Arco, 4% at Occidental Petroleum Corp. and 18% at Unocal Corp.. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue at most defense companies also suffered as government contracts 
continued to shrink. Los Angeles-based Northrop Corp. saw sales drop 9%. 
Teledyne Inc. and Rohr Inc., which also depend on government work for much of 
their sales, posted even steeper declines. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales at Lockheed Corp. in Calabasas jumped 29% to just over $13 billion, 
moving the defense company up to the No. 6 spot on the list. However, much of 
Lockheed's gain stemmed from the purchase of General Dynamics Corp.'s F-16 
fighter jet division last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mergers and acquisitions also played a key role in the revenue growth of 
health insurers, as the health care industry consolidates in response to a

 Wellpoint Health Networks Inc., PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., FHP 
International Corp. and TakeCare Inc. were among the managed health care

THE TIMES 100 / THE BEST PERFORMING COMPANIES IN AMERICA; RISING FORTUNES; FAT 
PROFITS FROM OVERSIZED CLUBS; CARLSBAD-BASED CALLAWAY DOMINATES THE GOLF 
INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The letters pour in at Callaway Golf Co., about 10 a day from golfers around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I received a Callaway No. 7 from my wife," begins a golfer from Alpharetta, 
Ga. "While playing with a friend at the Cartersville Golf Club, I pulled my 
brand-new Callaway out of my bag at their Hole 3 (156 yards) and shot a 
hole-in-one." 
</P>
<P>
 Stories like that, spread from one clubhouse to another, have helped turn 
Carlsbad-based Callaway -- maker of the oversized Big Bertha drivers -- into 
America's leading golf club manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get constant evidence that everybody likes our products," says Ely 
Callaway, the company's 74-year-old chairman and inventor of the revolutionary 
club that took the industry by storm after its introduction in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Callaway's sales have been lofty ever since, hitting $254.6 million last year, 
an impressive 93% jump from $132 million a year earlier. Earnings more than 
doubled last year to $43 million. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of performance earned Callaway the No. 2 spot on this year's Times 
100 list, with a 59.2% average two-year return on shareholder equity. It also 
ranked No. 7 among California companies with the fastest revenue growth, 
according to data compiled by Star Services, a San Francisco-based business 
research firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Callaway first sold stock to the public in February, 1992, its shares 
have more than tripled. 
</P>
<P>
 Callaway's metal "woods" dominate the industry and account for 80% of company 
sales. More than 1 million golfers own Big Bertha clubs, which sell for as much 
as $260 each and get their name from a German cannon used in World War I. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Berthas have a stainless steel head and are a quarter-size larger than 
conventional metal woods -- whose contradictory name goes back to the days when 
most drivers were indeed wooden. The Big Bertha's larger hitting surface, the 
company says, helps golfers get the ball airborne easier and make straighter 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more forgiving when one mis-hits," Callaway says in a raspy voice 
reminiscent of Ross Perot. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to expand on its success, Callaway this year introduced a line of Big 
Bertha irons, based on the same technology. The company spent $2 million to 
develop the clubs. (Generally, woods are used for hitting longer shots.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Callaway's goal is ambitious: It wants to be the leading seller of both metal 
drivers and irons. No company has done that, Callaway says, since Wilson 
Sporting Goods did it some 40 years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 "We expect our irons to be very important to the industry," says Callaway, a 
former three-handicapper who now plays golf only on weekends to test Big Bertha 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 A key feature of Callaway's new irons is that the hitting surface -- or face 
-- is 40% larger than that of conventional clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Callaway faces a tough competitor in Karsten Manufacturing Co., a 
Phoenix-based maker of Ping clubs, the top-selling brand of irons. A set of Big 
Bertha steel irons -- Nos. 3 to 9, plus a pitching wedge -- is expected to 
retail for about $900, or about 20% more than a comparable set of Pings, 
Callaway said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts think golfers will pay a premium for the Big Bertha irons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Callaway has a reputation now for introducing quality products that enhance 
the game," said Eric Appell, an analyst at Torrey Pine Securities in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "The irons could have a tremendous impact," he added, noting that they were 
well-received at a PGA merchandise trade show earlier this year. Among swingers 
of Big Bertha drivers are many on the PGA tour, as well as former President 
George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Callaway's success wasn't won easily. When Ely Callaway, who had already made 
a fortune in the textile and wine businesses, bought the company in 1982, it 
employed three people who produced hickory-shaft putters and wedges in a 
1,300-square-foot shop. Sales that year were about $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, when Callaway introduced a set of clubs that incorporated elements of 
the Big Bertha design, sales soared, and they've nearly doubled every year 
since. The company sold $255 million worth of products last year, about 30% of 
that overseas. Today Callaway employs 1,400 people -- up from 900 a year 
earlier -- in a 250,000-square-foot plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Ely Callaway says it is unrealistic to think his company can maintain such 
phenomenal growth. Analysts, for example, see sales and earnings growing about 
25% this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Georgia native says, his company has a long way to go. "If we keep 
on doing what we're doing, the opportunities are so good we don't need to do 
anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he laid out plans for his successor last year, Callaway says firmly 
that he has no plans to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell no, there's too much to do," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let my competition play golf if they want," he adds with a hearty laugh.

THE TIMES 100 / THE BEST PERFORMING COMPANIES IN AMERICA; THE HUMAN FACTOR; 
RISING RESTLESSNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Stuart Silverstein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 JOB HOPPING -- rampant until a few years ago, when the cold reality of the 
recession hit the employment market -- is beginning to bounce back in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Even employees who aren't looking into jumping to new firms are stirring, 
often pushing their bosses harder for pay raises, promotions and new 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Employment specialists say the growing restlessness, still in its very early 
stages, reflects frustrations linked to the pay freezes, heavier workloads and 
other hardships endured during the recession. With the California economy and 
many of the state's employers finally showing signs of recovery, employees are 
beginning to try to make up for lost ground in their careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word on the street is that the economy is doing better, so why not look 
(for a new job) now? It's not the way it was a year ago, when everyone was 
laying off people," said Lisa Carp, director of human resources for Palm 
Springs-based Bird Products Corp., a maker of ventilators and other medical 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Carp says she is receiving 10 to 15 unsolicited resumes a month from people 
who are employed but looking for new jobs, up about 20% from last year. 
</P>
<P>
 While some employers continued to cut back by shrinking their staffs in 1993, 
others were bulking up. Safeway, the largest employer among the state's 
publicly held firms, added about 1,000 workers to bring its worldwide work 
force to 105,900. And computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co., the state's No. 2 
employer on The Times Top 100 Employers list, added 4,000 workers to bring its 
international work force to 96,600. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive recruiters say the task of coaxing managers to consider leaving 
their current jobs for new positions has gotten easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not getting the resistance we were getting just six or seven months 
ago," said Gary Kaplan, an executive recruiter based in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, he explained, many executives routinely turned down overtures 
from other employers because they feared that, as new arrivals, they might be 
the first to be laid off if the companies embarked on layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were frightened," Kaplan said. "They were concerned about being the new 
person in a new environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, employers are beginning to notice increased turnover. Close to 10 
middle managers, among a U.S. staff of more than 900, have left jobs at 
Standard Chartered Bank so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nina Woodard, Standard's employee relations manager in Los Angeles, said she 
was stunned recently when a local clerical employee whose job was being 
eliminated turned down an offer to stay with the company in another, 
higher-paying capacity. The departing employee, Woodard said, told her she 
could do better in the open market. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, many people -- perhaps the vast majority of Californians with jobs -- 
are still reluctant to get back into the job market. The market remains glutted 
with unemployed workers who have more time on their hands to aggressively 
pursue the limited number of openings. 
</P>
<P>
 That is particularly true in California, where the jobless rate -- 8.6% in 
March -- is far higher than the national level (6.5%). "There are too many 
people and too few opportunities," said Jim Rockett, human resources director 
at CTX International, a computer monitor manufacturer in Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
 To Thomas J. Richardson, district manager of Kelly Temporary Services in San 
Bernardino, the job market appears to be on the mend. "There are fewer people 
out there than six months ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in a truly strong market, Richardson says, people who want to switch jobs 
or occupations will often come to his firm to find temporary work to hold them 
over until a permanent position turns up. So far in this recovery, he said, 
that isn't happening. 
</P>
<P>
 Star corporate performers, however, are increasingly testing the job market or 
seeking new rewards and challenges from their current jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's enough movement in the economy that the best and brightest in each 
organization are starting to push," said Mark L. Feldman, an organizational 
behavior specialist in San Francisco with the management consulting firm 
William M. Mercer Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for example, Earl M. Rozran, a 36-year-old manager who joined Bird 
Products in February as director of its respiratory accessories unit. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last few years, he chafed under cost cutbacks at his previous 
employer, a medical products company where he had worked 11 years. For one 
thing, annual salary increases, even for good performers, were limited to 3%. 
In addition, the company slashed layers of management, which to Rozran meant 
there would be fewer opportunities for promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he balked at looking for jobs at other firms. "The feeling at that 
point was that the grass can't be that much greener elsewhere. Everyone was 
going through the same kind of pain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 By late last year, though, Rozran concluded that "there is greener grass 
somewhere. It was just a matter of finding it." He was receptive when 
approached in November by an executive headhunter representing Bird Products 
and quickly landed his current job. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Triolo was also encouraged by the indications of an improving economy to 
take a chance on a new job. 
</P>
<P>
 She had a job as an office manager for a Sacramento publishing firm but felt 
that, professionally, she had hit a dead end. So she started thinking about 
working in law enforcement, a field that had long interested her. But Triolo 
was afraid that because of the slumping economy, if she got a job in law 
enforcement and it didn't work out, she might not be able to find anything else 
suitable. 
</P>
<P>
 By mid-December, however, when she got a second offer to join the Sacramento 
County Sheriff's Department as a service representative -- a job that involves 
handling phone calls from the public -- the 41-year-old Triolo decided to go 
for it. "At my age," she said, "I figured it was do or die." 
</P>
<P>
 She added, however: "I would have hung on to (her old job) with all 20 fingers 
and toes if I had some serious doubts that I wouldn't be able to get another 
job if it didn't work out at the Sheriff's Department. . . . If the economy 
isn't going well, you're going to sit on your job." Top 100 Employers

THE TIMES 100 / THE BEST PERFORMING COMPANIES IN AMERICA; THE HUMAN FACTOR; 
PRODUCTIVITY REMAINS KEY CONCERN FOR FIRMS; IT'S HARD TO MEASURE BUT, MOST 
AGREE, COMPANIES NEED MORE OF IT.

<P>
 From health care to transportation, employee productivity and efficiency are 
on the minds of California companies struggling to succeed in a tough economic 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be much more aware of operating efficiencies now," said Alan R. 
Hoops, president and chief executive of PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., a 
Cypress-based health maintenance organization that has faced growing corporate 
and government pressure to reduce medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But measuring productivity is an inexact science that leaves even veteran 
economists confused. "These things are enormously tricky," said Frank Wycoff, a 
professor of economics at Pomona College and a specialist in work force 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times 100 measures company productivity as a ratio of revenue to total 
employees. As a result, a company's productivity can be changed dramatically by 
cutting its work force -- as many firms have done. Productivity can also jump 
when revenue rises faster than payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the measure fails to reflect the use of equipment and machinery, and 
it assumes that all workers -- despite differences in jobs, skills and ability 
-- are equally productive. It is also difficult to use the figures to compare 
different companies -- even those within the same industry -- because so many 
factors influence productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite problems in measurement, productivity remains a major concern at many 
California companies.  
</P>
<P>
 At Santa Monica-based FirstFed Financial Corp., keeping productivity high 
means being hard-nosed about new hiring, says Jackie Kitaka, senior vice 
president and director of human resources. The savings and loan saw 
productivity grow to $640,000 per employee in 1993 from $531,000 the previous 
year, according to data compiled by Star Services, a San Francisco-based 
business research firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult for people to arbitrarily ask for additional staff," even 
to replace a departing employee, Kitaka said. When a position becomes vacant at 
one of the company's 25 savings branches or eight loan offices, Kitaka's 
departments analyzes such things as customer waiting time or loan volume to see 
if a replacement is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 "If volume is down on the loans side, we wouldn't automatically hire another 
underwriter," Kitaka said. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology has played a major role in boosting worker productivity at 
Orange-based Bergen Brunswig Corp., the nation's second-largest distributor of 
pharmaceuticals and health care products to hospitals and drugstores.  
</P>
<P>
 Faced with growing competition and flat prices, Bergen Brunswig -- which 
generated about $1.6 million in revenue per employee, according to The Times 
100 rankings -- has turned to automation to fill an estimated 90% of customer 
orders, company spokeswoman Karen Wiley said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, employees ride motorized carts called "data mobiles" that are 
guided by electronic signals to quickly locate products in the company's large 
warehouses. After the product is loaded onto the data mobile, the cart 
automatically tells the employee whether or not the quantity matches the 
customer's order. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will see more and more of it," Wiley said. 
</P>
<P>
 At some companies, workers themselves came up with simple ideas to increase 
productivity. A team of employees at Varian Associates, a Palo Alto electronics 
firm, studied ways to cut the average of six weeks it took to install 
radiotherapy machines at hospitals, which use the equipment to treat cancer 
patients. The result: Installation was cut by more than 3 1/2 days. 
</P>
<P>
 One time-saving trick was to replace the foam packing pellets used to protect 
equipment during shipping with a different type of insulation. Workers used to 
spend about 30 minutes cleaning up the pellets after the shipping crates were 
opened, company spokesman Bill Bucy said.  
</P>
<P>
 These and other factors allowed Varian, which employs 7,800 people, to boost 
productivity from $157,000 per employee in 1992 to $172,000 last year.  
</P>
<P>
 PacifiCare's revenue has more than tripled since 1990, to more than $3 
billion. Productivity grew to $925,000 per employee in 1993 from $837,000 the 
prior year. 
</P>
<P>
 But efforts to curb spiraling health care costs have limited PacifiCare to 
annual price increases of between 2% and 4% since 1990, said CEO Hoops. 
"Operating efficiency in the health care field is becoming more of a critical 
factor than it has ever been," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 PacifiCare is monitoring its computerized customer service files to identify 
and resolve common mistakes that annoy patients and reduce efficiency. Most

MIXED CROP

 LOS ANGELES COUNTY, still lagging the state as it enters a long-awaited 
economic recovery, once again is underrepresented on this year's list of 
California's most profitable companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 27 firms based in Los Angeles County are listed on The Times 100, which 
ranks companies based on average two-year return on equity. That compares to 26 
Los Angeles County firms that made the list in 1992 and 33 in 1991. The low 
figures are due in part to the fact that the list tends to highlight newer 
companies in younger industries, and Southern California is still struggling to 
emerge from a punishing four-year recession. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that a number of Los Angeles County firms premiered on or 
returned to The Times 100 last year, several of them representing economic 
sectors considered crucial to the region's future well-being: health care 
(Herbalife and Maxicare Health Plans Inc.), entertainment and leisure (Samuel 
Goldwyn Co., United Television and Leslie's Poolmart), business services 
(Mercury General) and environmental services (Tetra Tech). 
</P>
<P>
 But for every Los Angeles County company that moved up in rank on this year's 
Times 100, three saw their positions slip -- including well-established firms 
such as Walt Disney Co., Mattel Inc. and Countrywide Credit Industries Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Herbalife International Inc., an Inglewood-based maker of dietary and 
nutritional supplements that has been dogged by controversy, vaulted to the No. 
1 spot on the list, with a whopping 142.2% average two-year return on equity. 
</P>
<P>
 Herbalife also continues to grow strongly, ranking No. 3 in the county among 
companies with the fastest sales growth: up 70% to $364.7 million, with $41.2 
million in profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors apparently have taken note: Herbalife's stock price has soared over 
the past year, rising from about $10 a share a year ago to $19.875 on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 The company's products are marketed through a network of independent 
distributors who in turn sell directly to consumers -- a so-called multilevel 
marketing plan that has raised regulatory eyebrows in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxicare Health Plans, a Los Angeles-based health maintenance organization, is 
again in the pink, occupying the No. 6 position on The Times 100 -- following a 
disastrous acquisition binge in the 1980s and a resulting bankruptcy 
reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 Rapid growth financed by junk bonds took Maxicare to a peak of 2.2 million 
members in 42 health plans in 26 states, rivaling industry leader Kaiser 
Permanente in size. 
</P>
<P>
 But inability to manage the resulting debt led to management upheavals and 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy, from which the company emerged in December, 1990, with 
270,000 members and seven plans in its core operating states of California, 
Indiana, Illinois, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Income has been up and down since then. In 1993, the company reported net 
earnings of $5.6 million on revenue of $440.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But membership has grown to more than 300,000. And by focusing more on acting 
as a middleman manager for health care plans, the company is poised for future 
expansion, said investment banker Chriss W. Street in Corona del Mar. "They are 
growing faster than the average HMO, around 20% to 25% annually," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Goldwyn Co., which distributes art and specialty films and also 
produces more general features, had a 35.2% average two-year return on equity, 
placing it No. 18 on The Times 100. It is a modest firm by Hollywood standards, 
with $124.4 million in sales and $4.4 million in profit. But that represents 
earnings growth of 389% over 1992, and Goldwyn has managed to beat the odds for 
independent film companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Its 1993 releases included the art house hits "Much Ado About Nothing" and 
"The Wedding Banquet." In stark contrast, the company also produces the popular 
television program "American Gladiators." 
</P>
<P>
 The firm was established in 1979 by Samuel Goldwyn Jr., son of the legendary 
mogul, and it owns the rights to films the senior Goldwyn produced, including 
"Wuthering Heights," "The Best Years of Our Lives" and "Guys and Dolls." 
</P>
<P>
 Mercury General Corp. is in the prosaic business of insurance. Its two 
subsidiaries, Mercury Casualty Co. and Mercury Insurance Co., write automobile 
policies primarily in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had a 26.2% return on shareholder equity, ranking it No. 40 on The 
Times 100. It posted earnings of $96.2 million on revenue of $398.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other firms on the list, some of Los Angeles County's most notable 
corporations saw their rankings slip in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney Co., the Burbank-based entertainment conglomerate, slipped from 
No. 54 to No. 97 as profit fell last year, largely due to the poor performance 
of the Euro Disney theme park near Paris. Even so, the company remained the 
county's profit leader in 1993, with income of $764.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, toy maker Mattel Inc. dropped to No. 31 on The Times 100, down from 
No. 14 last year, as earnings dipped partly due to costs from the takeover of 
rival Fisher-Price Inc., in a deal valued at more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the El Segundo-based creator of the Barbie doll extended its 
buying spree by swallowing up Kransco, maker of Wham-O toys such as the Hula 
Hoop and Frisbee, consolidating its position as the world's largest toy 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Countrywide Credit Industries Inc., the Pasadena-based parent of the nation's 
largest residential mortgage lender, saw its position drop to 47th from 27th 
simply because its equity capital grew faster than its revenue or earnings, 
said analyst E. Gareth Plank at Mabon Securities Inc. in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Countrywide loaned at record levels in 1993 due to falling interest 
rates and the boom in home mortgage refinancings, giving the firm the county's 
fifth-fastest revenue growth (63%) in 1993 and making it the county's No. 8 
profit leader, with $171.4 million in income. Los Angeles County Profit Leaders

THE TIMES 100 / THE BEST PERFORMING COMPANIES IN AMERICA; THE REGIONS; HEALTH 
CARE A TONIC FOR OC ECONOMY; RESPIRATORY AND INFUSION THERAPY FIRM ABBEY IS A

 Three years ago, Abbey Healthcare Group Inc. was teetering on the edge of 
financial collapse. But after sacking its top management and slashing costs, 
the Orange County company last year ranked among California's most profitable 
public companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa-based Abbey is No. 3 on this year's Times 100 list, based on its 
two-year average return on shareholder equity of 54.2%. The ranking is the 
highest ever by an Orange County company in the seven years The Times has 
compiled the annual guide. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not bad in three years to go from near bankruptcy to being ranked third 
in California," said Timothy M. Aitken, the British investment banker who has 
been chairman of Abbey since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 How did Aitken do it? He eliminated about 1,000 jobs, replaced the firm's 
chief executive and other senior management, raised $340 million in capital and 
encouraged managers to be more entrepreneurial.  
</P>
<P>
 Aitken also went on a shopping spree. In the past two years, the company has 
spent more than $240 million on 31 mostly small companies. By far its biggest 
purchase was the $194-million acquisition last year of Total Pharmaceutical 
Care Inc., a home-infusion company based in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbey's earnings grew 30% to $14.3 million in 1993, while revenue was up 32% 
to $329 million from the previous year. The company attributes its earnings 
growth to concentrating on its fast-growing core businesses: respiratory 
therapy and infusion therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's lucky for Orange County that there are some strong health care companies 
here," Aitken said, adding that it helps to pick up the slack from the 
shrinking defense industry. Four Orange County companies ranked among the top 
20 on The Times 100 list, and 13 other firms in the county also made the list. 
Seven of those are in the health care field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Health care is still a growth industry, and that's been good for Orange 
County," said Don Booth, an economist with Chapman University in Orange. He 
said President Clinton's health reform proposal, which would provide health 
coverage to about 37 million uninsured people, could help spur demand for 
companies that design and build medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Other health care firms on The Times 100 list include PacifiCare Health 
Systems Inc., the Cypress-based health maintenance organization, although its 
ranking fell to No. 29 last year from No. 12 the year before. During 1993, 
PacifiCare purchased California Dental Health Plan of Tustin, a dental HMO, for 
$20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Hoops, president and chief executive of PacifiCare, said profit was 
dampened by its decision to raise about $100 million in a secondary stock 
offering to finance expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a number of acquisition opportunities," he said, "and we felt we 
needed the capital to participate in this environment." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Abbey's competitors, Homedco Group Infusion, a hospital management 
company based in Fountain Valley, jumped to No. 17 on the most-profitable 
companies ranking. It did not make the list last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Imperial Credit Industries Inc., a mortgage banking firm in Santa Ana Heights, 
and Fidelity National Financial Inc., a property and casualty insurer in 
Irvine, ranked No. 12 and No. 13, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Imperial Credit's earnings increased 35% to $18.4 million last year. The 
company, which originates or sells and acquires mortgage loans, was buoyed by 
new offices, which generated more loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Day Runner Inc., the Fullerton company whose name has become virtually 
synonymous with personal organizers, came in at No. 53. Its earnings rose 19% 
to $5.3 million on sales of nearly $82 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans have been getting more organized for a number of years," Chairman 
and Chief Executive Mark Vidovich() said. "We had a record year in terms of 
sales and earnings, partly because of some new products." 
</P>
<P>
 First American Financial Corp., a property and casualty insurer in Santa Ana, 
ranked No. 38. And Anaheim-based food products maker Bridgeford Foods Corp. 
ranked No. 48. Orange County Profit Leaders

THE TIMES 100 / THE BEST PERFORMING COMPANIES IN AMERICA; A GUIDE TO THE GUIDE; 
PUTTING THIS GUIDE TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 THIS SEVENTH EDITION of The Times 100, our annual inquiry into the performance 
of companies headquartered in California, was produced by the Los Angeles Times 
business staff using data collected and analyzed by Star Services, a San 
Francisco business research company. 
</P>
<P>
 Star gathered information on 790 California-based companies whose stock is 
publicly traded, relying on databases, corporate and government reports, a mail 
survey and phone calls to companies. Certain historical and other data was 
obtained from a variety of databases, corporate and government reports, a mail 
and fax survey and telephone calls to companies. The tables generated by Star 
were closely reviewed by Times editors and reporters. Criteria for the rankings 
were jointly developed by The Times and Star. 
</P>
<P>
 Annual figures for this section may not match the latest fiscal year numbers 
reported by companies. If a company's fiscal year did not end in November or 
December, 1993, or January, 1994, then the latest 12-month period ending in one 
of those months was used to calculate an annual figure. For year-to-year 
comparisons, the 1993 figures are compared to the corresponding four quarters 
ending in November or December, 1992, or January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Page 39 of this section lists those companies whose fiscal year does not 
coincide with the calendar year; it also lists the 12-month period on which 
data is based. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial data from prior years has not been restated for acquisitions or 
discontinued operations. This allows readers to see actual historical growth 
for the company, whether from internal growth or acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 A few companies have majority-owned subsidiaries that are traded as separate 
entities. The financial results for these subsidiaries are presented 
independently as well as on a consolidated basis in the accounts of the parent 
companies. This applies, for example, to ICN Pharmaceuticals (parent) and SPI 
Pharmaceuticals. General Criteria 
</P>
<P>
 All companies must be publicly traded on one of the major exchanges -- the New 
York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or Nasdaq -- and be 
headquartered in California. Income is defined as after-tax income from 
continuing operations and excludes extraordinary items, as well as gains or 
losses from discontinued operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales exclude excise taxes, extraordinary income, revenue from discontinued 
operations and other income such as interest. For banks and savings and loan 
associations, revenue equals the sum of interest and non-interest income. For 
insurance firms, revenue equals the sum of earned premiums, realized gains or 
losses from investments and net investment income. For all charts except the 
stock market performance charts, companies must have had at least $50 million 
in 1993 sales. Section Notes  
</P>
<P>
 The Bottom Line: Return on equity measures the profit a company earns for 
every dollar common stockholders have invested in the firm. Return on equity is 
defined as income available to common shareholders divided by the average 
common shareholder's equity. Income available to common shareholders is 
calculated by subtracting preferred dividends (if any) from income from 
continuing operations. The Times 100 table ranks companies by the average 
return on common equity for the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 For The Times 100 table, companies must have met these criteria: publicly 
traded since December, 1992; sales in 1993 greater than $50 million; profit 
from continuing operations in 1993 and 1992, and no negative common equity for 
either of the last two fiscal years. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies in the Top 25 and Bottom 25 in Absolute Profits must have been 
publicly traded in 1992. Just as the Top 25 in Absolute Profits ranks companies 
by dollar amount of profits from continuing operations, the Bottom 25 ranks 
companies by dollar amount of loss. The Top 25 Banks and S&Ls table shows 
return on assets, which measures the percentage profit for every dollar in 
assets. Companies must have been publicly traded in 1992 with total assets 
exceeding $200 million. Return on assets in The Times' list may differ from 
what is disclosed by the institutions themselves because Star divides income by 
the average of assets for the same reporting period. The figure thus reflects 
profit earned on a constantly growing asset base. 
</P>
<P>
 The Top 25 in Profit Margins measures the percentage profit for every dollar 
in sales. Companies must have been publicly traded in 1993 with total sales 
exceeding $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Born Again table shows companies that have had the greatest turnaround 
from a loss in 1992 to a profit in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nose Dives table shows companies that have suffered the greatest decrease 
in earnings from a profit in 1992 to a loss in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate investment trusts and limited partnerships were not eligible for 
inclusion in this section because income for these companies, which is not 
taxed at the company level, is not comparable to after-tax income for 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants: The Sales 100 ranks companies by net revenue. For banks and 
savings and loan associations, revenue equals the sum of interest and 
non-interest income. The Biggest Service companies table ranks service firms by 
net revenue. Service companies include entertainment, leisure, media, retail, 
utility, transportation, wholesale, business and personal service, investment, 
real estate and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 View From the Street: A company's stock must be available for trading on the 
New York or American stock exchanges, Nasdaq or among the major listings, and 
must have been available for trading before Dec. 31, 1993, to make the Market 
Value 100 and the Lowest Priced, Highest Priced, Favorites and Forlorn tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Market value is the company's stock price times the number of shares 
outstanding and generally reflects the esteem in which investors hold a 
company's stock and the confidence they have in its future success. Book value 
is total stockholders' equity (assets minus liabilities). 
</P>
<P>
 Companies on the Favorites and Forlorn tables must have had 1993 sales of at 
least $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Charging Ahead and Falling Behind tables, a company's stock price on 
April 8, 1994, must have exceeded $2. Stock prices as of March 31, 1993, have 
been adjusted to reflect stock splits and stock dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Lowest-Priced and Highest-Priced lists, a firm's market value on March 
31, 1994, must have exceeded $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Divvying It Up list of dividend yields ranks companies on the ratio of 
their current indicated annual dividend to their stock price as of April 8, 
1994. In most cases, this figure is the latest quarterly dividend multiplied by 
four. There is no guarantee that the same amount of cash dividend will be 
declared for subsequent quarters this fiscal year or that a dividend will be 
declared every quarter. The list excludes real estate investment trusts and 
master limited partnerships because their dividends often include a return of 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The table of Top Performing Initial Public Offerings ranks companies that had 
their initial public common stock offering in 1993 by the stock price 
appreciation between the initial offering date and April 8, 1994. Certain data 
was provided by Spotlight Development of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The Great Expectations list ranks companies based on investment analysts' 
published earnings estimates, as compiled by Star Services. A minimum of 15 
analyst estimates are required for each company listed. The estimates are as of 
March 31, 1994. The estimated earnings-per-share increase and percentage 
increase are an average of all analyst forecasts for that company. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising Fortunes: For the Growth 100, sales growth can come either by 
generating new business or acquiring other firms. A company must have been 
publicly traded since 1992, with 1992 sales exceeding $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies eligible for the Fastest Profit Growth table must have been publicly 
traded and shown a profit from continuing operations for the last two years. 
Income in 1992 from continuing operations must have been at least $10 million. 
Net income figures for all companies have been adjusted to exclude changes in 
accounting rules issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board involving 
the setting aside of reserves when federal taxes rise. 
</P>
<P>
 The Human Factor: California-based companies are ranked by the number of full- 
and part-time employees worldwide at year-end, excluding consultants and 
contractors. Employment figures are estimates provided by the company. If 
year-end results were not available, employee estimates are from the latest 
completed quarter. The table excludes companies that are large employers in the 
state but are headquartered elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The Most Productive Employees list ranks only the top companies in each sector 
by revenue per employee (worldwide), but the group average is computed from 
figures on all the companies in the industry that were surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiring trends were obtained from the companies, which used the following 
guideline when responding to the question: "What is your company's hiring 
outlook for the upcoming 12 months?": Increasing (up more than 5%), neutral (as 
much as 5% up or down), reducing (down more than 5%) 
</P>
<P>
 The Regions: Same criteria used for the main tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbreviations: Stock exchange symbols are as follows: NY/New York Stock 
Exchange, AS/American Stock Exchange and NMS/National Assn. Securities Dealers' 
National Market System. 
</P>
<P>
 The company stock symbol refers to its stock ticker symbol and is not 
necessarily the way the company is listed in stock tables in this newspaper.

THE TIMES 100 / THE BEST PERFORMING COMPANIES IN AMERICA; THE GIANTS; 
SOLECTRON'S MANTRA FOR SUCCESS; IT'S 'FASTER, BETTER AND CHEAPER.' IN JUST FIVE 
YEARS, THE MILPITAS COMPUTER CIRCUIT BOARD MAKER HAS BECOME A GLOBAL PLAYER 
WITH MORE THAN $1 BILLION IN REVENUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 How could a domestic manufacturer with just $140 million in sales in 1989 turn 
itself into a multinational player with more than $1 billion in revenue in five 
short years? 
</P>
<P>
 "By delivering products faster, better and cheaper," said Koichi Nishimura, 
chief executive of Solectron Corp., a computer circuit board manufacturer based 
in Milpitas. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds simple, but the company's recipe for success includes painstaking 
attention to product quality, the manufacturing process and customer 
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 The rewards have been substantial. Solectron placed No. 3 on The Times 100 
list of the fastest-growing companies in California by boosting sales 133% in 
1993 from the year before while increasing profit by 159%. Analysts expect 
sales to nearly double again this year, while profit, hit by stiff competition 
in the industry, will grow at a slower-paced but still impressive 50% rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Solectron's success may be a harbinger of America's re-emergence as a 
manufacturing center capable of going head-to-head with lower-cost Asian 
competitors. While Solectron has operations around the world, the majority of 
its revenue comes from manufacturing operations in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1977 by former International Business Machines Corp. executives as 
a small assembly shop, Solectron has benefited greatly from blue chip 
companies' efforts to become leaner and meaner. Leading manufacturers such as 
Apple Computer Inc., Sun Microsystems and Motorola Inc. have their circuit 
boards built by Solectron so they can focus their resources on more important 
areas such as marketing and design. 
</P>
<P>
 Solectron's expertise in circuit board production has been confirmed over the 
past two years as the company has purchased factories from IBM, Hewlett-Packard 
Co. and Philips in such locations as France, Scotland, Malaysia, North Carolina 
and Washington state. Many of the plants that were losing money under the 
management of these leading manufacturers are now profit centers for Solectron. 
</P>
<P>
 "IBM hires the cream and trains people better than anybody else, but they 
underutilize their people and micro-manage them," Nishimura, a former IBM 
manufacturing manager, said during a telephone interview from Solectron's 
French subsidiary in Bordeaux during a recent business trip. Analysts estimate 
that Solectron's costs per worker are as little as half of major manufacturers 
such as IBM. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the company's quality products and strong customer service that has 
had customers coming back for more. Solectron has been using Japanese-style 
quality control techniques since 1982, before the practice became trendy among 
U.S. business. And when many U.S. manufacturers abandoned quality circles in 
the late 1980s as too cumbersome, Solectron used computers to make the process 
even more effective than in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past decade, the company has reduced defect rates to three per 
million products, impressive even by the standards of Japan's best companies. 
In 1991, it was awarded the Commerce Department's Malcolm Baldrige National 
Quality Award for its system of ensuring customer satisfaction and quality 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 Advanced engineering and motivated workers have enabled Solectron to fine-tune 
the manufacturing process to a startling degree. Its Milpitas factory, for 
example, builds 800 different circuit boards every day in average lots of just 
50 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Solectron's flexibility enables customers to keep inventories low and make 
last-minute changes in design and order levels. Two-thirds of its orders 
typically involve such changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Japanese don't want any schedule changes for 30 days" before delivery, 
Nishimura said. Solectron, however, will sometimes accommodate a customer's 
request for changes on the day of production. 
</P>
<P>
 Solectron takes pride in its nimbleness. When a Japanese company wanted a 
prototype of a circuit board for a new disk drive, Solectron completed the task 
in 13 days -- with no errors. "A good Japanese supplier," Nishimura said, 
"would have taken six weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 The same mind-set is applied throughout the company. Customers are asked to 
fill out weekly report cards on the company's performance in four key areas so 
problems can be identified and treated quickly. The company also closes its 
books weekly instead of every three months like as most companies do so that 
the company can add resources or cut back in certain areas according to market 
conditions. This required reducing to two days the nine days it previously took 
to close the books. 
</P>
<P>
 Personnel policies reflect the companies manufacturing and customer 
orientation. Everybody from executives to assembly workers gets bonuses based 
on quality and delivery. Production engineers are paid more than marketing 
executives, the reverse of most American companies, to reflect the importance 
of production. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our company, (manufacturing) is all we do, so it's pretty important," 
Nishimura said.

THE TIMES 100 / THE BEST PERFORMING COMPANIES IN AMERICA; A VIEW FROM THE 
STREET; SHIFTING TIDES OF THE MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 TECHNOLOGY STOCKS are in, utility and financial stocks are out. Or maybe it's 
the other way around. On Wall Street, judging what's in and what's out is a 
relatively simple exercise, of course: Just look at the trend in stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what our Market Value 100 listing essentially does for the biggest 
California companies. 
</P>
<P>
 A company's market value is its stock price times the number of shares 
outstanding. So as stock prices rise or fall, so do companies' gross market 
values -- investors' collective judgment of each firm's dollar worth at any 
particular moment. 
</P>
<P>
 What the 1994 Market Value 100 tally shows is that investors bid the shares of 
many California technology companies sharply higher over the past year, while 
stocks of banking, utility, energy and insurance firms were slammed. 
</P>
<P>
 The market value of computer chip king Intel Corp., for example, jumped from 
$24 billion a year ago to $28.2 billion as of March 31, a big enough rise to 
make Intel No. 1 on the Market Value chart -- knocking the perennial leader, 
oil giant Chevron Corp., into second place. March 31 was the cutoff date for 
the Market Value 100 chart. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, SCEcorp, parent of Southern California Edison Co., saw its market 
value plummet to $7.4 billion in the 1994 tally from $11 billion a year ago, 
dropping it to 14th from 9th on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 In market parlance, investors have been exhibiting a clear preference for 
"growth" stocks -- faster-growing young companies -- over "value" stocks, the 
slower-growing, high-dividend, old reliables such as utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, that was true until recently. Over the past few weeks, Wall Street 
has begun to turn back to the value stocks, while tossing many technology 
stocks and other growth issues out the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Blame these shifting tides on interest rates' fluctuations. A year ago, when 
interest rates were still declining in a sluggish economy, value stocks such as 
SCEcorp, BankAmerica Corp. and Unocal Corp. were the market's undisputed 
favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 That made sense: Better to count on the dependable dividend of a plodding 
giant than on the iffy prospects of smaller growth companies who were at the 
mercy of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 By last fall, though, business activity was clearly on the upswing, and 
interest rates responded accordingly by edging slowly higher. 
</P>
<P>
 For the utilities, banks, insurance companies and other classic value stocks 
that fare best when rates are stable or falling, the turn in rates was murder. 
Investors began selling value stocks in a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 The natural beneficiaries of the economy's newfound strength, meanwhile, were 
growth stocks, especially in technology, the Golden State's favorite-son 
industry. The stocks soared in the fourth quarter and into the first two months 
of this year as investors bet on booming sales and earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 But by late March, rising interest rates became too much even for go-go growth 
investors to bear. The growth stocks began to slump, and the value stocks went 
down with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last week. After three successive boosts in short-term interest rates 
this year by the Federal Reserve Board, investors' thinking now appears to have 
come full circle: Many experts see the economy slowing again by summer, 
eventually leading to lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, the value stocks are in again, while many growth stocks remain on 
the outs. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, though Wall Street pundits concern themselves with the horse race 
between value and growth, for most investors the game need not be so cut and 
dried. By definition, a well-balanced portfolio would contain value stocks and 
growth stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The key is knowing how to recognize when stocks in either group are bargains 
and when they're overpriced. Bargains you buy; overpriced stuff you ignore (or 
unload), just like in the department store. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where the other elements of our Market Value 100 chart can help: The 
listings of "book value" and "market value as a percentage of book." 
</P>
<P>
 Book value is the theoretical liquidation value of a company -- in other 
words, the assets that would be left for shareholders after all debts were 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Market value as a percentage of book value, therefore, tells you how Wall 
Street currently values a company relative to shareholders' equity. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Intel, market-to-book is 403%: The company's assets, less 
liabilities, are theoretically worth $7.01 billion, but the value of its shares 
is $28.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors thus believe Intel's future is bright enough that paying four times 
its true worth today is fair. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no single "correct" market-to-book ratio for stocks; in general, the 
ratio will always be highest for companies with the fastest growth rates, and 
lowest for the slowest-growing firms or those whose stated book value is most 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 What Wall Street pros look for are stocks whose market-to-book ratios are at 
the lower end of their historical ranges, at the same time that the companies' 
prospects appear to be improving. The idea is to buy assets for as small a 
premium as you can, just before the value of those assets is enhanced by better 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the beating taken by many classic value stocks over the past six months, 
bargain hunters may naturally be drawn to stocks such as Home Savings parent 
H.F. Ahmanson & Co., now selling for a mere 67% of book value (compared to 83% 
a year ago); BankAmerica, at 102% of book (compared to 139%), and Countrywide 
Credit Industries Inc., at 174% (compared to 268%). 
</P>
<P>
 True, investing in financial stocks today requires a leap of faith that 
interest rates won't rocket off the charts. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the same can be said of growth stock investing. The surest way to bring 
down lofty market-to-book valuations on technology stocks and other growth 
issues would be to offer sharply higher interest rates on bonds and other 
competing investments. 
</P>
<P>
 With many tech stock market-to-book ratios still far above year-ago levels, 
even with the latest sell-off in those shares, only bargain seekers with very 
long time horizons may find technology a relative value now. The Market Value

THE TIMES 100 / THE BEST PERFORMING COMPANIES IN AMERICA; A VIEW FROM THE 
STREET; WHAT RISES FASTER THAN DOUGH? WILLIAMS-SONOMA STOCK; THE PURVEYOR OF 
FANCY KITCHENWARE SPENT 1993 FOLLOWING A DIFFERENT RECIPE FOR PROFIT.

<P>
 When Williams-Sonoma Inc. shareholders gathered at the company's headquarters 
near Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco last spring, they had reason for 
concern. Why weren't the hand-painted Portuguese plates and Australian 
crystallized ginger selling as well as they used to? 
</P>
<P>
 Profit for the San Francisco-based retailer, best known for fancy kitchenware 
and gourmet food, had plummeted during an expansion that increased the 
company's retail outlets by more than 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were building stores but not profits," Williams-Sonoma Chairman W. Howard 
Lester said, recalling his description of the company's problems at last year's 
annual meeting. "We decided we would open no new stores. Instead, we decided to 
go back to work and find ways to make existing stores as productive as possible 
before opening any additional sites." 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy worked. Williams-Sonoma executives expect an upbeat atmosphere 
next month when shareholders gather for the 1994 annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 And they have reason to be happy. An investor who purchased 100 shares of 
Williams-Sonoma stock for $883 (or $8.83 each) on March 31, 1993, would have 
seen that investment swell to $3,750 on April 8, 1994, when the company's 
shares were trading at $37.50. (The company's stock closed Friday at $33.75 a 
share.) 
</P>
<P>
 That made the retailer's stock the biggest percentage gainer among California 
companies, according to data compiled by Star Services, a San Francisco 
business research company. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock price gain would look even more impressive had the company not 
approved a 3-for-2 stock split in January, which lowered the value of each 
share without changing the shareholders' equity. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams-Sonoma's experience supports the notion that bigger is not always 
better -- especially if the company is ill-prepared to manage growth. But 
Williams-Sonoma seems to have learned from its mistakes. It has succeeded in 
its efforts to boost productivity at its 209 stores, which include the Pottery 
Barn and Hold Everything housewares chains. 
</P>
<P>
 One tack the company took was to streamline management. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, for example, each of its retail chains and its catalogue division 
had separate managers who reported to a general merchandise manager who in turn 
reported to the president.  
</P>
<P>
 But the company consolidated the Pottery Barn's retail and catalogue 
operations under a vice president for merchandising. The same kind of 
consolidation was made in the Hold Everything retail and catalogue operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also eliminated the general merchandise manager's position and 
gave much of those responsibilities to Gary Friedman, executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 "Previously, there were too many lines of management," Chief Financial Officer 
Jim Riley said. "Now the people making merchandise decisions are not as far 
removed from the front lines of store and catalogue operations."  
</P>
<P>
 At its Pottery Barn stores, the company abandoned its strategy of moving 
toward higher-priced products after sales plummeted. Now it offers more 
lower-cost housewares. It is also aggressively promoting those goods to 
budget-minded consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Ellis, an analyst with Goldman Sachs, likes the changes he has seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our view," Ellis said in a recent report, "the new management structure . 
. . will improve the company's focus on each of these businesses and materially 
improve their merchandising and marketing momentum." 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts believe that Williams-Sonoma's stock will also be buoyed by the 
company's association with Catalog 1, the nation's first catalogue-based cable 
TV shopping network. The network, a joint venture of Spiegel Inc. and Time 
Warner Inc., features products by Williams-Sonoma and six other companies with 
catalogue sales operations. Catalog 1 operates in four cities and will be 
expanded soon into others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wall Street believes that all catalogue companies can benefit from video 
shopping," said Steven Ashley, an analyst at Cleary Gull in Milwaukee. 
"Catalogue operators already have the warehouses and the product delivery 
systems. They can simply put the products featured in their catalogues onto the 
television screen." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams-Sonoma operates 209 stores in three chains: Williams-Sonoma, known 
for its kitchenware and food items; Pottery Barn, which sells lower-cost 
housewares and Hold Everything, which sells closet organizers and shelving 
goods. The company also has five catalogues -- one for each of the three 
chains; a lounge wear and bathroom products publication called Chambers, and a 
gardening products catalogue called Gardener's Eden.

THE TIMES 100 / THE BEST PERFORMING COMPANIES IN AMERICA; A VIEW FROM THE 
STREET; A BOOM YEAR FOR STOCK OFFERINGS; DOZENS OF CALIFORNIA COMPANIES FIND 
SUCCESS IN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A raging bull market and an economic recovery made 1993 a record year for 
initial public stock offerings, and dozens of California companies rejoiced as 
their share prices soared following their Wall Street debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies from a broad range of industries shared in the prosperity, though 
technology firms led the pack, as in previous years. And while the majority of 
the IPOs were start-up companies, 1993 also saw a number of well-established 
firms go public, mostly as a result of corporate spinoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the largest initial public offering last year was the result of just 
such a deal: PacTel Corp., the cellular communications subsidiary of Pacific 
Telesis, sold $1.38 billion of shares to the public after it was spun off from 
its giant parent firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Fittingly, though, California's best-performing IPO was Netmanage Inc., a 
classic Silicon Valley start-up. The company went public in September at $16 a 
share and traded at $38.75 on April 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times 100 ranking of top-performing IPOs ranks companies that went public 
in 1993 by the stock price appreciation between the offering date and April 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Netmanage sells software that enables computers to talk to one another, 
especially via the complex system of data networks collectively known as the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 Zvi Alon, founder and chief executive, attributes the San Jose-based firm's 
success to two key technology bets: that the Microsoft Windows personal 
computer operating system and the data transmission protocol called TCP/IP 
would both emerge as industrywide standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to the mix a "religious commitment to ease of use," as Alon puts it, and 
you have one of the hottest companies in the sizzling communications software 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Following Netmanage on the best-performing list was a company representing 
another booming sector: chip-making equipment. Tencor Instruments, which went 
public at $7.50 and saw its shares soar more than 115% during the past year, 
makes the complex equipment needed to measure and inspect the slabs of silicon 
used to create computer chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other chip equipment companies were near the top of the list; two of 
them, Electroglas and Ultratech Stepper, were spun off by Connecticut-based 
General Signal Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a major growth cycle in the semiconductor industry," said Dan Case, 
president of the San Francisco investment bank Hambrecht & Quist, which has 
underwritten 18 IPOs for California companies this year. Case said demand for 
semiconductors -- and therefore demand for chip-making equipment -- tends to 
pick up at the beginning of an economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Case also noted that 1993 was a weak year for biotechnology offerings, as 
investors worried about regulatory problems and the decade or more it can take 
to bring biotech products from the laboratory to market. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such problems, San Diego biotech company Vical Inc. ranked No. 4 among 
top-performing IPOs in California. And that's despite the fact that the 
company, which is developing therapies to treat hepatitis, doesn't expect to 
have sales until 1997 at best. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, none of the stocks in the sexiest corner of the technology 
industry -- multimedia -- managed to rank among the 10 most successful IPOs. 
Educational software developer Davidson Associates, which is moving strongly 
into multimedia programs, ranked No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The much-hyped 3DO Co., which has developed a sophisticated new machine for 
computer games and multimedia education programs, ranked No. 23, though its 
share price has been falling for months after hitting a heady $48 last year. 
(The offering price was $15.) 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the recent stock market downturn has been especially hard on small 
technology companies, which could make 1994 a quieter year for high-tech IPOs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, 1993 was a record year for IPOs, with 816 deals raising more than 
$57 billion, according to Peter Schoenke, editor of the New York-based 
newsletter Going Public: The IPO Reporter. IPOs: How They Fared

THE TIMES 100 / THE BEST PERFORMING COMPANIES IN AMERICA; A VIEW FROM THE 
STREET; A REVERSAL OF FORTUNE FOR MEDICAL FIRMS; SIX OF THE 10 STEEPEST STOCK 
PRICE DECLINES OCCURRED IN THAT SECTOR. ONE REASON? GROWING WORRY OVER HEALTH 
CARE REFORM.

<P>
 It's easy to stumble in a rough-and-tumble industry. And few industries were 
jostled as much as health care was last year. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no surprise, then, that six of the 10 California companies that suffered 
the steepest stock price declines in 1993 were in the turbulent medical 
equipment and services businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very, very difficult environment," says Alan H. Magazine, president 
of the Washington-based Health Industry Manufacturers Assn., which represents 
700 companies that supply more than 90% of U.S. medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade association chief faults slow approval of new devices by the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration, which he says can discourage venture capital 
investment in the industry. But he believes federal health care reform 
proposals may be hurting even more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sales in many parts of the industry are stagnant," Magazine says. "Hospitals, 
doctors, clinics and others aren't buying nearly as much medical technology . . 
. in part because of the uncertainty of what the health care system is going to 
look like as a result of reform." 
</P>
<P>
 Advanced Medical Inc. was growing so fast a few years ago that its 40% revenue 
gain placed it among the 100 fastest-growing California companies on The Times 
100 list in 1992. But sales at the San Diego firm, which makes intravenous pump 
systems, fell from $128.3 million in 1992 to $119.4 million last year, Chief 
Financial Officer Joseph W. Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's stock plunged from nearly $6 a share a year ago to $1.125 as of 
April 8, according to data supplied by Star Services, a San Francisco-based 
business research firm. Advanced Medical officials attribute the decline to 
hospitals postponing equipment purchases as they face intense pressure from 
insurers to cut costs.  
</P>
<P>
 "One of the primary factors had to do with the slowdown in hospital buying 
decisions," says Kuhn, who describes the medical marketplace as "highly 
competitive and mature." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Century City-based CBL Medical Inc., an operator of medical clinics 
specializing in workers' compensation cases, saw its stock fall from nearly $3 
a share a year ago to 21 cents as of April 8. The company says its 1993 
performance stalled when payments from workers' comp insurers slowed as 
carriers reacted to widespread fears over claims fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 CBL is one of a number of companies that have retreated from the workers' 
compensation field, citing insurance payments that were as much as 500 days 
late. Company executives also say some insurers threw out legitimate claims in 
their heightened search for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, CBL -- then the last publicly held company in Southern 
California in the workers' comp business -- announced it was abandoning the 
business and laying off most of its 140 employees. On Dec. 30, the company, 
which once managed 10 clinics to treat injured workers, filed for Chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente-based Laser Medical Technology Inc., whose stock plunged from 
about $9 a share a year ago to $1.375 as of April 8, recently completed a 
restructuring that ended with its founding family selling its stock and leaving 
the company. The small firm, which makes lasers and other devices for dentists, 
moved from France to California in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 When Laser Medical entered the market three years ago, the prospects for using 
laser technology in dentistry looked much brighter, but interest has since 
cooled. Today plans center on other products, including files and automated 
devices to perform root canals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to redevelop the markets we were once successful in," says Ira 
J. Fertik, the fourth chief executive to run Laser Medical in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some non-medical businesses also fared poorly.  
</P>
<P>
 UnionFed Financial Corp., the Brea-based parent of Union Federal Savings Bank, 
blamed losses from bad real estate loans for its steep stock decline. 
UnionFed's stock, trading at more than $11 a share a year ago, had fallen to 
$1.625 as of April 8. Another company registering a steep stock decline was 
Kenfil Inc., a Van Nuys software distributor. As a result of lost sales due to 
damage caused by the Northridge earthquake, Kenfil earlier this month agreed to 
be acquired by hardware distributor AmeriQuest Technologies Inc. of Irvine.

THE TIMES 100 / THE BEST PERFORMING COMPANIES IN AMERICA; RISING FORTUNES; 
PEEKING AT THE FUTURE

 TERMS SUCH AS multimedia and information superhighway , which surfaced on a 
mass scale for the first time last year, have been derided recently as heavy on 
hype and light on substance. But these futuristic communications and 
entertainment services are already helping to propel many of California's 
fastest-growing companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Growth 100 list, which ranks companies by revenue growth, is usually 
ruled by high-tech enterprises. But many of the growth leaders in 1993 
attributed their success to the creation of new forms of communication and 
media that are beginning to gain widespread acceptance among consumers and 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Media Vision Technology Inc., No. 2 on the list with a whopping 248% sales 
growth rate, went public in the fall of 1992. The Fremont-based firm, one of a 
handful of companies making kits that bring multimedia capabilities to personal 
computers, benefited from plummeting PC prices and the desire of consumers, 
once they bought a PC, to do more than process words. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Executive Paul Jain also credits the firm's hardscrabble status with 
inspiring productivity. The company's employees, he said, "worked very hard, 
not only for financial gain but for personal recognition."  
</P>
<P>
 About 80% of the firm's $248 million in sales last year came from CD-ROM 
drives, video and sound cards. The remaining revenue came from CD-ROM titles 
and semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
 SynOptics Communications Inc., No. 9 on the Growth 100, dominates the market 
for devices called hubs, which coordinate the mini-superhighways of personal 
computer networks that are going on-line in many businesses as huge mainframe 
computers are traded in for more flexible desktop PCs. Among the firm's recent 
customers: Wells Fargo Bank & Co., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Georgia-Pacific 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a part of the data communications revolution," Chief Operating Officer 
Bill Ruehle said. "People are realizing they have to be able to share 
information, access large files and transfer large masses of data. To do that, 
they have to be connected."  
</P>
<P>
 Helping to drive sales growth at Cirrus Logic Inc. (No. 32) was the new market 
for 16-bit audio chips -- more sophisticated than their eight-bit predecessors 
-- that bring compact disc-quality sound to the home computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic Arts (No. 33) profited from new ventures in CD-ROM games, the 
multimedia technology helping to fuel the video game market. 
</P>
<P>
 SuperMac Technology Inc. (No. 26) said 5% of its sales last year came from a 
new product, plug-in video cards that allow video footage to be captured and 
displayed on a Macintosh computer. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains unclear whether multimedia and communications firms can sustain 
such rapid growth. Media Vision is restructuring after an unexpectedly poor 
earnings report in the first quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 SuperMac Chief Executive Michael McConnell doesn't expect his company to show 
up on next year's Growth 100. "We grew really fast, entered new markets, and 
now we've got some digestion to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor can anyone be sure whether the golfing boom that buoyed Callaway Golf Co. 
(No. 6), and Charter Golf Inc. (No. 31) onto the Growth 100 list will continue. 
But it paid off well for both companies, which achieved revenue growth last 
year of 93% and 56%, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Health care firms made another strong showing on the list this year, although 
some top companies from last year slipped in their ranking. Health maintenance 
organization TakeCare Inc. fell to No. 41 from No. 3 last year, and nursing 
home operator GranCare Inc. dropped to No. 19 from No. 12. Breaking into the 
top 15 were high-tech firms such as AST Research Inc. (No. 13) and IDB 
Communications Group Inc. (No. 5). 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 1 firm on this year's Growth 100 list, Mycogen Corp., a San Diego 
biotechnology firm, attributed its 255% leap in revenue almost entirely to its 
acquisition of Agrigenetics, the seed and plant gene research division of 
Cleveland-based Lubrizol Corp. Renamed Mycogen Plant Sciences, the unit is 
headquartered in Prescott, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City-based IDB said the economic recovery was key to its move up the 
rankings to No. 5 from No. 21. While about 30% of its growth came from the 
acquisition of a competitor in the Washington area, company President Edward 
Cheramy said the firm's business -- providing international long-distance 
telephone service -- also grew from expansion in China and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1992, we saw an overall slowdown in foreign business development," Cheramy 
said. "Either people were not opening new plants overseas or they were closing 
them down. By the middle of last year, we noticed a reverse in that trend." 
</P>
<P>
 Among IDB's new customers last year: computer chip maker Intel Corp., No. 37 
on the Growth 100 list. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, a company had to pedal faster this year to make the growth list, an 
indication of a slightly healthier economy. A company needed sales growth of 
26% to make this year's list, compared to 20% in 1992 and 15% in 1991. The 
range was higher as well: In 1992, the highest rate of growth was 114%; this 
year the top four firms posted growth rates of more than 115%. The Growth 100
