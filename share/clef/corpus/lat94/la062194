 BAD PR: The Supreme Court has cleared the way for employers to enforce 
English-only rules (A1). But what's OK under the law may not be OK for worker 
relations. . . . Jeff Ornstein of Superior Industries in Van Nuys said the 
wheel-manufacturing company would keep publishing newsletters in Spanish for 
its large Latino work force. "It's important to make the worker feel he is part 
of the company," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 POTENTIAL: South African golfer Ernie Els won the U.S. Open on Monday (C1), 
but he's not the only young pro with a bright future. The same goes for Alemany 
High grad David Berganio Jr., who made the cut before he faded over the 
weekend. . . . Bob Thomas of FORE Magazine in North Hollywood said Berganio 
should get a big "psychological boost" from his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 TAX FALL: The value of the Valley is going down, and you know where much of 
the blame goes. The quake, of course (Valley Business, Page 3). In fact, 
officials estimate that quake damage will slice $1.3 billion from property 
values. . . . John Crowner (above) of the county assessor's office, stands by 
some of the boxes full of quake-relief sheets filed by property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 LION'S SHARE: Much has been written about the collaboration of singer Elton 
John and lyricist Tim Rice for Disney's "The Lion King." Still, don't give them 
all the credit just yet. They also got help from gospel artist Andrae Crouch of 
Woodland Hills, who provided vocal and choral arrangements. . . . Crouch also 
has pitched in on Top 40 hits for Michael Jackson and Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW LOOK: This business of going civilian is a tough assignment for companies 
who made their money in defense. Take Datametrics Corp. in Chatsworth. It's 
gone through quite a personality change, even putting commercial and defense 
workers in different buildings. . . . But the future is far from certain: Will 
people buy their new printers? See Valley Business, Page 10. Michael Arkush

 SUMMER SOLSTICE: Summer begins today at 6:48 a.m. That's when the Earth's tilt 
places the sun at the Tropic of Cancer, its northernmost point. . . . Today is 
also the longest day of the year. Simi Valley gets a jump on the day, with 
sunrise at 5:43 a.m. In Ventura, sunup is three minutes later. Ventura 
residents will see the last vestige of the sun slip behind the horizon at 8:11 
p.m., weather permitting -- three minutes later than sunset in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 LEGAL EAGLE: Ruth Fischbach of Ventura couldn't be more pleased with her son, 
Donald. The Ventura native and graduate of Buena High School has been elected 
president of the State Bar of California. "I'm very proud," Ruth Fischbach 
said. "He's worked very hard and he deserves it. That's a mother's viewpoint, 
of course." Donald Fischbach practices law in Fresno, where he settled after 
finishing Hastings Law School. He was elected Saturday to lead the 
141,000-member State Bar on a platform pledging no new programs and no increase 
in dues. 
</P>
<P>
 PLANE CRASH: An ultra-light plane crashed seconds after departing the Santa 
Paula Airport, taking the life of its pilot (B1). Frank Ernest Perry Jr., 72, 
of Camarillo died in the homemade craft that stalled about 200 feet in the air 
before plummeting. . . . Slow-moving ultra-light planes can be safer than many 
other small planes, particularly if equipped with a ballistic parachute, said 
Robert Goyer, editor of Sport Pilot Magazine. The rocket-powered chute deploys 
in two seconds and can be effective as low as 100 feet. Perry was not carrying 
a chute. 
</P>
<P>
 NO PERFECT PLANS: Simi Valley's PerfectData Corp. has survived the departure 
of Lee Mannheimer. He's the company's longtime chief executive who remains 
under investigation involving an alleged murder-for-hire plot against his 
estranged wife. But PerfectData continues to be plagued with problems (Valley 
Business, Page 4). . . . The company lost money on its foray into the computer 
modem field, its new top executive says.

<P>
 This being the first day of summer, parents throughout the area are turning to 
thoughts of how to keep the kids busy during summer vacation. Many are opting 
for the science classes, camps and workshops being offered by local 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Children can take advantage of the wealth of scientific facilities in the 
Southland, such as museums and science labs, to learn about the world around 
them. Most programs include hands-on activities and incorporate crafts and 
other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes are generally taught by educators or professionals in the field. Some 
facilities offer extended day care for children. A few organizations have 
limited scholarships available for low-income families. Classes fill up fast, 
so early registration is a must. A sampling: 
</P>
<P>
 * The California Museum of Science and Industry will offer the 31st year of 
hands-on science workshops for young people at the museum site in Exposition 
Park. More than 40 classes for children ages 4 to 16 in courses ranging from 
"Bubbles Galore (ages 4-6)," "Life in the Sea (ages 6-8)," Crime Lab Chemistry 
(ages 8-11)," "Advanced Rocketry (ages 11-13)" and "Star-Spangled Skies (ages 
12-16)" will be given. With the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
and the University of Southern California, the museum will be inaugurating a 
two-week Robot Summer Camp for young people ages 5 to 16 beginning Aug. 1. 
Service and industrial robots will be used as teaching tools in the special 
classes. The popular Curators Kid Club offers one week of day-long science 
activities for children as well. Workshops begin July 11. (213) 744-7444 
</P>
<P>
 * The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County will have hands-on 
"Adventures in Nature" classes for children ages 3 to 14. Three one-week 
courses will include morning and afternoon sessions on topics ranging from 
insects to dinosaurs. The students will receive experience in observing and 
working with scientific specimens and exploring items from the museum's 
collections. Other topics being offered include mammals, plants, earthquakes, 
whales and reptiles. Classes begin July 18. (213) 744-3534 
</P>
<P>
 * The Eaton Canyon Nature Center Associates are offering weekly full-day and 
half-day Science Day Camp programs through July 22 for kids in kindergarten 
through sixth grade at Eaton Canyon County Park. Some topics that will be 
covered include "Science Detectives Camp," "Animal Explorers Camp" and "Space 
and Rocketry Camp." These classes are part of the Los Angeles County Department 
of Parks and Recreation's "Science Adventures For Kids" program, which is 
offered at a number of locations. Camps will be held in Cerritos, Culver City, 
Arcadia, Long Beach, San Pedro, Santa Clarita, Whittier and elsewhere. (800) 
472-4362 
</P>
<P>
 * Guided Discoveries, an nonprofit educational organization, still has 
openings for a one-week "Astrocamp" for children ages 8 to 15 at the Desert Sun 
Science Center near Idyllwild July 3-9. The residential camp will have courses 
organized by age level in astronomy, rocketry, robots and space technology. 
Youngsters ages 12 and older can learn how astronauts prepare for 
weightlessness in an underwater micro-gravity class given in the facility's 
pool. Telescopes, microscopes, gyroscopes and astronaut training equipment will 
also be used in high-tech science explorations. (909) 625-6194 or (800) 
645-1423 
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles Zoo will be having a Zoo Camp beginning July 18 for children 
entering grades one through six in the fall. Children can choose to learn about 
primates or animal adaptations in the one-week sessions. All classes will use 
crafts, games and extensive tours of the zoo's facilities to teach children 
scientific observation. The day-camp classes will run through Aug. 19. (213)

SPOUSE BATTERING: THE CRIME WAVE TOO OFTEN FORGOTTEN; SIMPSON CASE PUTS 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN THE LIMELIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's unfortunate it may take the arrest of a high-profile celebrity like O. J. 
Simpson to focus the nation on domestic violence, a very serious problem that 
for too long has been cast by its sorry practitioners as a "private family 
affair." It may be that the extraordinary events of last week will prove to be 
the beginning of the end of that neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 We must keep in mind, of course, that the former football star and well-liked 
celebrity has pleaded not guilty to charges that he murdered his ex-wife, 
Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman and that under our 
system of justice he is absolutely entitled to the presumption of innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it is irrefutable that the sports commentator pleaded no contest to a 
1989 misdemeanor charge of spousal battery against Nicole Simpson. According to 
police records released last week, Simpson beat his then-wife so badly that she 
required treatment at a hospital after police officers found her cowering in 
bushes in front of their home. The beating left her with a cut lip, a blackened 
left eye, a bruised cheek and a hand imprint on her neck, according to the 
police report. She told the responding officers she wanted Simpson arrested. 
The police record quotes O. J. Simpson as saying, "The police have been out 
here eight times before, and now you're going to arrest me for this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson served no jail time after his 1989 no-contest plea despite a 
recommendation from the prosecutor in the case that he do so. Instead, Los 
Angeles Municipal Court Judge Ronald Schoenberg sentenced Simpson to 120 hours 
of community service and two years' probation. And Simpson had to pay only $200 
in fines and contribute only $500 to a shelter for battered women. The judge 
also allowed him to be treated by the psychiatrist of his choice -- and to be 
treated over the telephone rather than undergo the customary face-to-face 
counseling program for men who batter their wives. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's unusually light sentence is, sadly, symptomatic of how ineffective 
our legal system historically has been in responding to this commonplace crime 
of violence. The statistics are chilling: Women are four times more likely than 
men to be killed by their spouses or domestic partners, according to the most 
recent figures from the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. 
Nationally, FBI statistics show that a woman is battered every 15 seconds and 
that more than one-fourth of all murders of women are committed by spouses. Los 
Angeles Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti contends that a woman is killed in Los Angeles 
County every nine days in an episode of domestic violence. It is of course not 
true that domestic violence is confined to crimes by men; see the piece on 
today's Commentary page by Judith Sherven and James Sniechowski. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, only in the last decade have police departments across the nation 
begun to arrest batterers and have prosecutors begun to file charges even when 
a woman withdraws her complaint (often in response to her mate's threats or 
pleas). In Los Angeles, Garcetti, who was elected L.A. County district attorney 
in 1992, has made the issue of domestic violence one of his career-long 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that these are often tough cases for the authorities. Police 
traditionally dislike responding to domestic violence calls; such 
investigations are dangerous and emotionally messy. Sometimes the victim 
doesn't want to believe that her mate really meant to do her harm. She may even 
turn on the officers. That complicates the problem enormously, and women's 
shelters are full of bruised survivors trying to break the cords of their 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 California's immensely helpful stalking laws are in the forefront of 
legislation because they let police arrest a mate who violates a judge's order 
to stay away from a battered spouse. (There's no evidence that Nicole Simpson 
ever sought a restraining order against her ex-husband.) 
</P>
<P>
 If there is any good to come of the Simpson tragedy, it could be in advancing 
a candid public discussion about domestic violence and perhaps initiating 
policy changes to address this horrendous problem with stronger deterrents and 
tougher punishments. Unchecked by better police work, not to mention by wiser 
and firmer justice from the bench, domestic violence, particularly spousal 
abuse, will remain perhaps America's least-attended-to crime wave.

NO MORE CAT-AND-MOUSE; THE TIME HAS COME TO ESTABLISH NORTH KOREA'S TRUE 
INTENTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No, the crisis over North Korea's nuclear development program is not over, 
former President Jimmy Carter's optimistic statement notwithstanding. At best 
-- and that qualifier needs underlining -- Carter's "unofficial" but 
Administration-sanctioned meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Il Sung last 
week may have provided a fresh chance to test how serious Pyongyang is about 
swapping its nuclear weapons ambitions for greatly expanded trade, aid and the 
visible signs of international respectability. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few days U.S. and North Korean diplomats will probably explore 
that chance in conversations at U.N. headquarters in New York. Meanwhile, 
Carter's uninhibitedly upbeat praise for Kim Il Sung's intentions has for now 
stopped dead the Clinton Administration's effort to build a consensus in the 
U.N. Security Council for its sanctions resolution against North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 It wouldn't hurt at this point to review again what this still very active 
crisis is all about. Washington believes that North Korea has secretly 
reprocessed enough weapons-grade plutonium to build one or two nuclear weapons, 
in violation of its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
Last month International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors once more visited 
Pyongyang in hopes of examining fuel rods from a nuclear reactor to see whether 
plutonium had in fact been extracted from some of them. North Korean 
authorities frustrated that work, and Pyongyang announced it was quitting the 
IAEA and would treat any sanctions against it as an act of war. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, says Carter, North Korea is in a conciliatory mood. It proposes a 
presidential summit meeting with South Korea, which Seoul has accepted, and 
says if Washington resumes high-level talks it will freeze its nuclear program. 
Washington says fine, but on these conditions: that North Korea not extract any 
more plutonium from the fuel rods it removed from its reactor last month; that 
it not refuel the reactor; and that it allow international monitors to resume 
their jobs on-site. 
</P>
<P>
 These are reasonable if minimal conditions, but they still leave unanswered 
the key questions of whether Pyongyang earlier diverted plutonium and how much. 
A lot of security concerns -- for the United States, for South Korea, for Japan 
-- ride on the answers to those questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Any renewed dialogue with North Korea must aim at determining quickly whether 
Pyongyang is truly interested in normalizing its relations with the United 
States and others or whether its real priority is to arm itself with nuclear 
weapons as it goes on trying to fool the IAEA, Washington and wide-eyed 
visitors about its intentions. The cat-and-mouse game has to end. One way or 
another, the time to draw firm conclusions has come.

TOUGH, AND GOOD POLICY TO BOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today the Assembly Public Safety Committee is scheduled to debate SB 864, a 
bill that could inject some badly needed reality into the understandable clamor 
over crime and punishment in California. 
</P>
<P>
 If eventually enacted, SB 864 will put an initiative on the November ballot 
for voter consideration.The measure offers a sensible alternative to the 
ill-conceived "three strikes and you're out" initiative already on the ballot. 
Otherwise known as the Reynolds initiative, "three strikes" would amend the 
state Constitution to mandate life imprisonment without parole for a third 
conviction on any one of several felonies. If Reynolds passes, only subsequent 
amendment by a two-thirds popular vote could remove the law.  
</P>
<P>
 One problem with the Reynolds initiative is it is so broad it could wind up 
pushing extremely violent felons out of prison to make room for less violent -- 
and even nonviolent -- ones sentenced under Reynolds. Many Californians gladly 
would support harsh punishment for such violent crimes as murder, rape and 
kidnaping. But what about life in prison for residential burglary, petty theft 
and even making a false statement on a loan application? All of these crimes 
would qualify as a "third strike" under Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 Because California already has a "three-strikes" law -- a too-broad statute 
passed by the state Legislature -- the Reynolds constitutional amendment is, at 
best, unnecessary. What is necessary is SB 864, sponsored by Sen. Quentin L. 
Kopp (I-San Francisco). The Kopp measure appropriately reserves the harshest 
punishment -- life without parole -- for repeat violent offenders. It would 
make for a tough law and sensible public policy.

OLIVER NORTH'S NOMINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In Column Right on June 9, Cal Thomas argues that Republicans who criticize 
Oliver North "dare not speak" their motive, namely that "weak men fear strong 
men." He calls us spineless for not supporting North's traditional values. 
</P>
<P>
 The appalling truth is, too many Republicans have been spineless for remaining 
silent and not exposing the extent of North's amorality. For it is well 
documented that North is a narcotics trafficker! In 1990, North was banished 
for life by our neighbor, Costa Rica, which declared him persona non grata -- 
the most severe non-criminal penalty a government can impose. This was for 
overseeing an airlift which smuggled cocaine from Costa Rica into the United 
States. Even though he didn't keep the profits himself, using them instead to 
get arms for the Contras, North did this at the very time President Reagan and 
Vice President Bush were leading our nation's "War on Drugs"! 
</P>
<P>
 North's deviant behavior in smuggling crack cocaine into our country can never 
be labeled traditional values, not even by Pat Robertson and the religious 
right!

Ollie has been none too fastidious in implementing this one. 
</P>
<P>
 If Thomas thinks we need a strong man to lead us out of our "decadent

nomination in Virginia (letters, June 12). My concern relates to an area rarely 
mentioned in regard to North -- the deaths of numerous civilians in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Contra attacks, civilians were raped, tortured and killed -- 
unarmed and noncombatant men, women and children who used to live in the 
countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous U.S. citizens documented many of these attacks and submitted reports 
to the U.S. Congress. The lies by those involved in Iran-Contra had dreadful 
consequences for the people whose families cannot be brought back. The country 
of Nicaragua continues to suffer the devastating consequences of differing with 
U.S. political interests.

 No despots in history have ever done their dirty deeds unless it was under the

 * Kudos to the organizers of the 1994 World Cup Soccer championships scheduled 
for the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. But how did the planners manage to arrange it so 
that during the finale on July 17, the audience could look up and see the small 
comets hit the planet Jupiter?

LEGISLATORS' PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Hiking a legislator's pay from $52,500 to $72,000 in December "won't end the 
corruption because politicians still must grub for campaign contributions," 
(George Skelton column, June 6). You're right, George. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the hefty raise and numerous benefits besides, politicians will 
continue to "grub" not only for campaign funds, but because of greed. The more 
they earn, the more they expect to get once in office. Why do you suppose 
lobbyists hang around feeding that greed? And why do you think lobbyists are 
permitted to do what they do? Political payoffs will go on one way or another, 
no matter how high the salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why I resent my tax dollars going to help an ambitious greedy 
politician get where he wants to be because of the power, prestige and payoffs 
he expects as his due.

 * It is pretty sad when our teachers get a 3/4% pay raise in three years and 
our legislators vote themselves a 26% raise. When the teachers ask for a mere 
6% raise, they are told that there is no money and if it were approved, cuts 
would have to be made. The legislators had no problem finding the money, but I 
doubt if they would give up 6% of their raise for teachers.

EPA STUDY ON SMOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Considering how much is at stake, I must respond to Robert Scheer's recent 
attempt to discredit the federal Environmental Protection Agency's conclusion 
that environmental tobacco smoke, or secondhand smoke, is responsible for 3,000 
lung cancer deaths each year (Column Left, May 29). 
</P>
<P>
 Scheer's attack was based largely on a report by two economists who questioned 
the "statistical significance" of the studies reviewed by the EPA. Yet both 
economists admit they "do not have technical expertise in the physiological and 
biological transmission mechanisms of disease causing agents." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, they're not medical or public health experts and simply do not 
understand that in research involving relatively small sample sizes, it's the 
direction of the association between exposure and the disease that is the 
crucial factor. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, 24 of the 30 studies examined by the EPA found a positive 
association between ETS exposure and lung cancer, thus supporting the finding 
that secondhand smoke elevates the risk of lung cancer among ETS-exposed 
nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Scheer considers 3,000 lung cancer deaths "a very thin reed" upon 
which to base policy changes, public health officials strongly disagree. The 
evidence is in and is more than sufficient to implement interventions to combat 
tobacco-related diseases.

 * Your editorial against smoking (June 8) makes the sensible point that an 
addiction cannot be eliminated by fiat. You note that the prohibition of liquor 
was a devastating failure. Shouldn't the same logic apply to our futile efforts 
-- since 1914 -- to prohibit other mood-altering substances? 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest single incentive our society could give toward curbing violent 
crime would be to adopt a sensible program for the controlled distribution of 
drugs. As noted by your distinguished correspondent Robert Scheer, "The killing 
in the inner cities is primarily caused by fights over enormous profits from 
the illegal drug trade."

 * Your editorial on tobacco pointed out that prohibition of alcohol had been 
"devastating" and that prohibition of tobacco would be equally disastrous. This 
is obvious and it brings up an obvious question. If prohibition of alcohol or 
tobacco would be devastation, why is it such a great idea for any other 
dangerous drug?

PERSPECTIVES ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; WOMEN ARE RESPONSIBLE, TOO; IT'S NOT AN 
EITHER-OR SITUATION. BOTH MEN AND WOMEN ARE 'BOUND IN THEIR DANCE OF MUTUAL 
DESTRUCTIVENESS.' 
</P>

Angeles-based husband-and-wife consultant team works with corporations on

<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, the myth of the evil, brutal male perpetrator and the perfect, 
innocent female victim is being broadcast and written about as gospel. The 
discussion is national. The rage and sorrow, palpable. Only when we come to 
terms with the fact that domestic violence is the responsibility of both men 
and women, however, can we put a stop to this horrible nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic violence is not an either-or phenomenon. It is not either the man's 
fault or the woman's. It is a both-and problem. Both the male and the female 
are bound in their dance of mutual destructiveness, their incapacity for 
intimacy and appreciation of differences. They need each other to perpetuate 
personal and collective dramas of victimization and lovelessness, and so, 
regrettably, neither can leave. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a very untidy idea for people who have grown up with movies in which 
the "good guy" triumphs over the "bad guy" and rescues the damsel from 
distress. But to tackle the plague of domestic violence, we must alter our 
perspective. Facts:  
</P>
<P>
 * Half of spousal murders are committed by wives, a statistic that has been 
stable over time. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 1985 National Family Violence Survey, funded by the National Institute 
of Mental Health and supported by many other surveys, revealed that women and 
men were physically abusing one another in roughly equal numbers. Wives 
reported that they were more often the aggressors. Using weapons to make up for 
physical disadvantage, they were not just fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
 * While 1.8 million women annually suffered one or more assaults from a 
husband or boyfriend, 2 million men were assaulted by a wife or girlfriend, 
according to a 1986 study on U.S. family violence published in the Journal of 
Marriage and Family. That study also found that 54% of all violence termed 
"severe" was by women. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Journal for the National Assn. of Social Workers found in 1986 that 
among teen-agers who date, girls were violent more frequently than boys.  
</P>
<P>
 * Mothers abuse their children at a rate approaching twice that of fathers, 
according to state child-protective service agencies surveyed by the Children's 
Rights Coalition.  
</P>
<P>
 * Because men have been taught to "take it like a man" and are ridiculed when 
they reveal they have been battered by women, women are nine times more likely 
to report their abusers to the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, R.L. McNeeley, a professor at the School of Social Welfare of the 
University of Wisconsin, published "The Truth About Domestic Violence: A 
Falsely Framed Issue," again revealing the level of violence against men by 
women. Such facts, though, are "politically incorrect." Even 10 years earlier, 
Susan Steinmetz, director of the Family Research Institute at Indiana 
University-Purdue University received threats of harm to her children from 
radical women's groups after she published "The Battered Husband Syndrome."  
</P>
<P>
 Why are we so surprised and appalled that men hit and abuse women who are 
physically smaller when women regularly hit and abuse small children?  
</P>
<P>
 Why are we, as a culture, loath to expose the responsibility of women in 
domestic abuse? Why do we cling to the pure and virginal image of the "sweet 
young thing" and the "damsel in distress?" If we are sincere about change, we 
must acknowledge the truth: Women are part and parcel of domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Why does our culture refuse to hold women as well as men accountable for their 
participation in domestic violence? All of such women's behavior, whether 
perpetrator or victim, is understood and passed off as the byproduct of 
socialization or poor economic status. On the other hand, men are held fully 
accountable for all of their behavior -- despite the tough-guy stereotype all 
boys are encouraged to embody and the abuse many bear as a "normal and loving" 
part of their upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some will argue that women fall into "spousal abuse syndrome," in which female 
passivity is explained as the result of the male brainwashing the female into 
believing that she is the cause of his violence. Consequently, she is powerless 
to alter the situation. But the truth is that all females receive some form of 
the following lessons: "You must cater to a man's ego," "You're nothing without 
a man" and "It's just as easy to love a rich man."  
</P>
<P>
 Girls often acquire this garbage from insecure mothers who believe that they 
are doing what is best for their daughters. If women are not expected to think 
and act for themselves, if their self-esteem is in shambles and their 
dependency is characterized as "feminine," the fault cannot be laid at the feet 
of men. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this is intended to exonerate O.J. Simpson. If he is guilty of the 
murders with which he has been charged, he must answer for his actions. The 
point is that, in the reaction to this sensational case, we do ourselves a 
grave disservice to slip into a gender-biased frenzy, vilifying and accusing 
only men as abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's movement claims its goal to be equal rights for women. If that is 
so, then women must share responsibility for their behavior and their 
contribution to domestic violence. Otherwise, we remain in a distortion that 
overshadows the truth. Only the truth will show us the way out of the epidemic 
of violence that is destroying our families and our nation.

COLUMN RIGHT/ JOSEPH FARAH: MR. GORBACHEV GOES TO HOLLYWOOD; TINSELTOWN HAS 
RESURRECTED THE FORMER SOVIET LEADER AS THE ENVIRONMENTAL GURU TO LEAD US INTO 
THE 21ST CENTURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH FARAH, Joseph Farah is editor of Inside California, a state political 
newsletter, and Dispatches, a national biweekly media and cultural watchdog 
publication. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who says Hollywood has run out of heroes? Certainly no one who has witnessed 
the bowing and scraping going on as entertainment-industry leaders prepare to 
roll out the red carpet for an environmental prophet -- the man they tout as 
best able to cope with the world crisis as we near the dawn of a new 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
 Who is this latest guru? Is it Vice President Al Gore? The Dalai Lama? Ted 
Turner? Nope. The man with the plan is none other than Mikhail Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, the former Soviet dictator, the scourge of Afghanistan, the bane 
of Chernobyl, is coming to Tinseltown to address the Environmental Media Awards 
dinner this fall, and he's being hailed and heralded like a conquering savior. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorbachev has been reborn as president of the Green Cross International, a 
year-old global eco-lobby that promises to lead us hapless mortals -- whether 
we like it or not -- into the promised land of milk, honey and solar power. So 
what does he have to say to Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, oddly enough, Comrade Gorbachev and the heads of the major networks and 
movie studios share more than a few common goals. The EMA, for instance, a 
five-year-old organization of everybody who is anybody in the industry, seeks 
to incorporate environmental themes in popular programming -- from television 
to feature films to MTV videos. EMA's founder, Norman Lear, learned a long time 
ago that the best way to change the world is to change the way people think 
without them even realizing it. How? Through the use of slick, sneaky 
propaganda designed to change people's values -- to create new instincts in 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, Lear and his friends have systematically studied the world's problems 
at Harvard, Yale and Stanford. They know what's wrong. And even though they 
spend their time making TV sitcoms, they know how to fix things. Lear, in fact, 
says it is the sacred duty of the media to "help Americans understand changes 
needed in behavior and lifestyles." 
</P>
<P>
 And now paternalistic Hollywood know-it-alls may have found someone who can 
rival even them when it comes to promoting utopian sociopolitical ideals. At 
the EMA affair, Gorbachev is expected to discuss his organization's call for a 
shift in values and lifestyles -- Americans' values and lifestyles, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone can change the way people think, Mikhail Gorbachev can do it," 
exuded Andy Goodman, EMA's president. "He has been going around the globe 
speaking about the environment and the need for personal value change. We're 
excited to bring that message to Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 And it won't just be Hollywood hearing Gorbachev's message. For the first 
time, this year's EMA awards program will be aired on Turner Broadcasting 
System about a week after the Oct. 17 event. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, nit-pickers might ask, on what moral authority does Gorbachev preach to 
Americans? After all, while Gorby sounds like an eco-sensitive 
granola-cruncher, this is the same lifelong Leninist who presided over perhaps 
the most environmentally irresponsible nation in history. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Gorbachev now acknowledges that the Soviet Union, on his watch, was 
something of an eco-nightmareland. Nuclear waste in massive amounts was dumped 
into the open seas, hydroelectric dams turned the most arable lands into vast 
lake beds, species of fish that provided a major source of food were destroyed 
by timber clear-cutting. And then there was Chernobyl -- the worst nuclear 
disaster in history, and Gorbachev was the author of the international 
cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
 But, again, that would be quibbling. Gorbachev has changed, right? He's no 
longer the man he was -- the KGB-backed communist apparatchik who, even as late 
as 1990, had banned all independent media activity in the Soviet Union. No, 
that man has been transformed, metamorphosed and resurrected. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of socialism lives on," he wrote in his very first newspaper column 
distributed in the United States and worldwide in 1992, "and it is my feeling 
that the quest -- the desire to experiment and to find a new form for putting 
the socialist idea into practice -- is ongoing."  
</P>
<P>
 The dream lives on indeed. And now Mr. Socialism is turning to Hollywood to 
help him find that "new form." The red hammers and sickles are gone. Tanks are 
out. Barbed wire is passe. You can bet that when tyranny is revisited in the 
1990s, it will be all dressed up in green and made downright appealing with 
tasteful sound bites, moving imagery, great lighting and original scoring.

ANALYSIS; KNICKS UP AGAINST THE WALL, AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE JACOBSON, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now they have to do it all over again, go through the waiting, the tension, 
the silence in the dressing room before the game. They will have joy or they 
will punish themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm loving it," Derek Harper said, leaving his questioners to decide whether 
he meant it or not. 
</P>
<P>
 John Starks would speak no word to express himself, but he left no doubt about 
what he was feeling. He had the last shot and he made the last mistake, and he 
had played a stunning game, shooting life into the Knicks and grinding that 
defense into the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets won Game 6, 86-84, and Starks tried to win it -- not tie it -- 
with the last shot from deep on the wing as the clock burned out. And Hakeem 
Olajuwon, so wonderfully agile, got his big hand up and deflected the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the crowd of notebooks and microphones and cameras crowded into the 
dressing room, Starks secluded himself as much as a man can in a crowd. He sat 
wearing just a towel draped across his midsection, his feet on a chair, ice on 
his left knee. He rested his chin on two fingers of his left hand and closed 
his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "John is not talking," a functionary advised. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, Starks got up and left the scene. This is the third time in 
these playoffs that Starks has found defeat and his role unspeakable. This 
time, with 40.7 seconds to play, he'd thrown an interception to this man 
Olajuwon, and Starks smacked himself on the side of his head. Dumb play, his 
body language said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's hard on himself," Harper said. "He's s perfectionist. After Game 1, he 
was hard on himself. He came back and played well. I expect the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Starks scored 27 points. He was all over the boxscore. Harper, however, had a 
poor shooting night. A lot of games are won by the big men during the regular 
season; in the half-court grind of playoffs, the burden falls on the guards 
like a safe falling out of the sky. "John gave us a chance to win," Harper 
said. "He singlehandedly carried us in the fourth quarter." 
</P>
<P>
 Starks scored 16 points in the last quarter. It wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks had come from nine points behind early in the fourth quarter to cut 
the margin to 78-77 on Starks' three-pointer. The defense was grinding so hard, 
forcing the Rockets to burn the shot clock getting up the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper had done another sensational job closing down Kenny Smith before he hit 
a three-pointer. It was 84-77, the Summit was shuddering with sound, and the 
Knicks were coming back again. "That's just the way we are," Harper said. "I 
guess we're destined to do it the hard way; we couldn't do it any other way." 
</P>
<P>
 The hardest was in Starks' mind. He can cause his team to win. He saw how he 
had permitted them to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 He made a layup on a break and then a three-pointer, and the Knicks were two 
points behind with 1:17 to play. He forced a turnover and he was taking the 
ball into the teeth of the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 He drove the middle, intending to draw Olajuwon into leaving Patrick Ewing 
open, coming out of the corner. Olajuwon wasn't named the top defensive player 
in the league for nothing. "I faked and went back to Ewing," he said. "I 
gambled; that's what they'd been doing all game." 
</P>
<P>
 Starks tried to hook his pass, and Olajuwon stepped in front of it. And Starks 
smacked his head. 
</P>
<P>
 One more chance. Harper forced Smith to waste the shot clock until it was into 
its last second before taking an awkward shot. Then Starks had 7.6 seconds for 
another chance. Houston gave a foul and then there were 5.5 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 They'd spent the whole day or even the whole year getting to this point. There 
had been the silence in the pre-game dressing room. Ewing sat there bouncing 
the ball to the rhythm of the music in his headset. He didn't speak. Greg 
Athony watched a tape of the fifth game. He didn't speak. Starks wrapped foam 
around a camera and didn't speak. 
</P>
<P>
 A double-spread front page of Mark Messier clutching the Stanley Cup hung in 
Harper's locker. He brought it from his locker in New York; it spoke volumes 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tension is crazy," said the veteran who'd never been in the Finals 
before. "You have to go through it to have the feeling; I can't tell you. I'd 
never expereienced it. It's the best feeling I ever had in my life -- except 
when my son was born." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Oakley passed inbounds to Starks, going left. The set was there for 
him to create a shot. Olajuwon went with him. "I was just hoping to get close 
to the ball with five seconds left," Olajuwon said, then tipped his smile to 
the danger of the ball in Starks' hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Starks could have taken the ball around Olajuwon for a tying layup. 
Maybe. "He made a choice," Pat Riley said. "If you don't take the first real 
good look at it, you may never get another." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the dressing room opened, Harper said his few cliches to Starks. 
Anything to help at a time like that. "I told him he had given us a chance to 
win," Harper said. "He said, 'OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And that left the mindset to be reset for two days of practice, two days of 
waiting, and then the tension again. They are remarkably similar and remarkably 
equivalent teams. Of all the players, only Earl Cureton of the Rockets has ever 
been on a champion. He hasn't been in one of these games. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, after a flurry of good games, went cold. He made two of 10 shots. "I 
had a bad shooting night in Game 1," he remembered. This time he made a 
three-pointer in the middle of the third period when the game was getting away, 
and a steal from Sam Cassell, the slick rookie, to get some momentum going for 
the Knicks. He shot poorly, he didn't play poorly. 
</P>
<P>
 He sat there with ice on both of his worn knees. One game left to play. "It'll 
be a long wait, a tough wait," he said. "It was very tough for me to sleep. All

They've been waiting since October.

NEWSWIRE: HENNING SUCCEEDS ARBOUR WITH ISLANDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York Islanders named assistant Lorne Henning as head coach, replacing 
Al Arbour, who retired after the NHL season. 
</P>
<P>
 Henning, 41, becomes the fifth coach in the franchise's 22-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Henning coached the Minnesota North Stars for two seasons, 1985-87, but said 
he joined the Islanders as an assistant to Arbour because the Islander head 
coaching job was what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deep down, I never really thought about it until Al made me an assistant," 
said Henning, who was 68-72-18 with Minnesota. "You keep it in the back of your 
mind, and every year I'd get ready because Al's going to retire. I've been 
ready for 10 years, but I wasn't in any hurry." 
</P>
<P>
 Henning served as head coach during a five-game stint this season while Arbour 
was serving a suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 Henning was a member of the original Islanders, ending his career as a 
player-assistant in 1980-81. Known as an outstanding penalty killer, he had 73 
goals and 184 points in 544 games. Colleges

 Arizona State's athletic department has been put on probation for one year for 
minor recruiting violations, including making too many telephone calls to 
recruits, the Pacific 10 Conference announced. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no penalties, but the school had to agree to a compliance review. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director Charles Harris called the decision "fair and reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State has reprimanded its football coaching staff and forbidden 
coaches to call recruits or their parents from July 1 through July 21, the 
first three weeks such calls are allowed during the 1994-95 football recruiting 
season.

 The NBA is seeking to keep in effect terms of the collective bargaining 
agreement with players after it expires Thursday and before a new one is 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik said court papers were filed in response 
to player association statements that it would be an antitrust violation to 
continue the draft, free agency, salary cap and revenue sharing if no agreement 
exists. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier suit, a judge ruled that terms of the previous agreement are 
effective as long as there is a reasonable belief negotiations will continue, 
NBA spokesman Brian McIntyre said. Miscellany

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; SAUDI ARABIA'S UPSET BID SLIPS AWAY, 2-1; 
GROUP F: HEAVILY FAVORED NETHERLANDS COME FROM BEHIND, SCORE WINNER IN 86TH 
MINUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 For months, Saudi Arabia eagerly awaited its first foray into the World Cup. 
The country's unheralded soccer team then put itself in position for an upset 
of epic proportions. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when reality set in. The Netherlands, trailing at halftime, rallied for 
a 2-1 first-round victory Monday night. Gaston Taument scored the game-winner 
in the 86th minute off a goalkeeper's mistake, setting off a delirious 
celebration by the partisan crowd of 52,535 at RFK Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning goal came when Saudi goalie Muhammad Al Deayea, who had played 
brilliantly to that point, strayed well out of the net to deflect a high kick 
from the left side. He missed, the ball took one bounce before Taument scored 
on a header from 15 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never scored a goal like that before; I can't remember anything like 
it," Taument said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dutch had tied the game in the 50th minute on a right-footed blast from 20 
yards by Wim Jonk. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavily favored Dutch dominated the first half, outshooting Saudi Arabia 
13-4, but the only score came in the 19th minute on a header by Fuad Amin. 
</P>
<P>
 Amin, positioned in front of the net as teammate Fahad Al Bishi took a free 
kick from the right side, directed the ball into the right side of the net past 
goalkeeper Ed De Goey. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Al Deayea smothered a shot by Dennis Bergkamp. Late in the 
half, Ronald de Boer was poised to kick the ball in until Al Deayea dived on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dutch team received boisterous support from thousands of orange-clad fans, 
several of whom were wearing wooden shoes. The Dutch fans began singing an hour 
before the game and rarely stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 A full brass band, accompanied by a bass drum, played throughout. Several 
Dutch fans hurled orange ballons and many hung signs over the railings, 
including one that said, "Orange Magic."

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; COMMENTARY; COMPARED WITH ALTERNATIVES, 
HOW COULD YOU NOT LOVE THIS GAME? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL JACKMAN, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm sure the zillion or so soccer fans around the world are happy to learn 
that they picked up yet another die-hard over the weekend. Hook, line and 
sinker I went for from the moment Germany and Bolivia squared off Friday 
through Sunday's triple-header. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the alternatives on television during these days when one qualifies 
for hazardous duty pay simply venturing outdoors might have had something to do 
with it: 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone knows the U.S. Open is relatively large, even folks who don't know 
the difference between a niblick and a base on balls. But for ESPN and ABC to 
combine for what, 100 hours of coverage, left nothing to the imagination. Be 
assured these guys are much better golfers than they showed at Oakmont. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the NBA Finals. Seriously, who among you Friday night didn't 
welcome the pictures of a Ford Bronco containing O.J. Simpson puttering along 
several freeways in the Los Angles area while 11 police cruisers paraded behind 
in a 4-1-3-2-1 formation? 
</P>
<P>
 And as far as baseball is concerned, there was a recent game that didn't go 
extra innings and didn't feature many runs yet convulsed along for nearly four 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer, it has long been argued, is dull if it's not boring. There's not 
enough scoring. A guy feints injury if an opposition player runs by rapidly. 
Referees see everything as a foul, the direct opposite of the NBA, and this 
yellow-card, red-card business is a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 The games watched carried scores of 1-0, 2-2, 1-1, 1-0, 3-1, 1-0 and 1-0. Not 
a scoreless deadlock in the lot. And no doubt it helped that I didn't back a 
loser in the bunch. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the key, do a little research before every game -- heaven knows there's 
been enough reviews and previews around to peruse, and pick your team. 
Americans are huge for the underdog, but don't take that easy way out. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, "my" team in the Belgium-Morocco game Sunday, won by the former, 
1-0, was Belgium. It was a very scientific selection. The goalie, Michel 
Preud'Homme, sold me not only because of his name but his age (35). The guy was 
brilliant all day, the Moroccans unloading 20 shots on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the coach, Paul Van Himst, known during his playing days as "the 
white Pele." Coaches generally are as sloppy as sportswriters, but Van Himst 
has been judged the best-dressed man in his country, for which he won a trip to 
Istanbul and a clothes voucher worth $1,340. Istanbul? 
</P>
<P>
 As opposed to that previously mentioned four-hour baseball game and Houston 
and New York taking 45 extra minutes to play a basketball game, two 45-minute 
halves in soccer might sound like forever, but not when it's running time and 
the clock doesn't stop for anything, including military coups in the country 
where the game is being played. 
</P>
<P>
 With a 45-minute half almost assured of being over in no more than 50 minutes, 
it's easy to concentrate on the antics of a star player or two and to get a 
good line on how the opposing teams propose to score. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States started out its game by trying to lure Switzerland into its 
half of the field before hitting basket-hanging breakaway threat Ernie Stewart 
with a bomb, sending him in alone against just one defender and the goalie. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't work, but the only thing that prevented Eric Wynalda's brilliant 
tally on a free kick from being remembered as "the shot heard 'round America's 
pitches" was Hang Down Your Head Tom Dooley taking a bad penalty setting up a 
free-kick score by the Swiss. Dooley, I'm going to be watching your every move. 
</P>
<P>
 Even easier to place full attention in than the U.S. game was Italy vs. 
Ireland in The Meadowlands. So the Irish are loaded with English players and 
directed by another Brit, St. Jack Charlton, all hands are imbued with a spirit 
that allowed it to reach the quarterfinals in the 1990 World Cup without a 
victory (four ties). It was the Italians who eliminated them then, 1-0 in 
overtime, so the Azzures were dead meat against the Hibernians' revenge 
motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 So much has been heard about Colombia's brilliance, many picking the team to 
be among the final four or maybe even in the title game, one had to go with 
Romania if only because ex-tennis player and agent Ion Tiriac once played goal 
for the team. 
</P>
<P>
 One look at how the goalies performed assured this upset. While Bogdan Stelea 
was beyond brilliant for the 3-1 Romanian victors, Oscar Cordoba "left his 
line" (maybe to visit the Rose Bowl concession stands) all but assuring defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 The hope is he plays with those anxious feet again Wednesday against the 
United States in Pasadena. See, I'm a fan.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; MANY CRITICS ARE BOTHERED BY CONCENTRATION 
OF POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The soccer community has leveled most of its criticism at Alan Rothenberg 
because of his apparent desire to control all parts of soccer.  
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg was elected president of the U.S. Soccer Federation, but in four 
years he has also taken over the World Cup effort and the proposed professional 
league, Major League Soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have charged that three men should be running the separate entities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throughout the federation, the perception is that Alan is wearing too many 
hats," said Edward Eid, a member of the Colorado Soccer Federation's board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rothenberg: "What some people call a conflict of interest, I call a 
confluence of interest. We need all of these things working together." 
</P>
<P>
 More eyebrows were raised when money -- about $2 million -- was funneled from 
nonprofit World Cup USA 94, Inc., to the for-profit pro league as a start-up 
loan, with Rothenberg in charge of both operations. 
</P>
<P>
 MLS is scheduled to begin play next summer, but as of early June, had not even 
chosen all the cities with teams.  
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg says FIFA, soccer's world governing body, mandated that his World 
Cup group use 30% of its funds to begin the new pro league. It is a claim 
others refute. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg put himself in charge of the league after submitting a business 
plan that was accepted by the USSF. 
</P>
<P>
 It has become such a sticky issue that Rothenberg has asked the IRS for a tax 
ruling, even though two independent tax-law firms said there were no problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything has been according to the original script," said Rothenberg, 
referring to FIFA mandates and World Cup board approvals. "There has been no 
criticisms until a couple of people, for their own political purposes, had 
ambitions to run for presidency of the USSF and had to look for some issue, and 
they created it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Eid, who is not running for office: "Basically the federation members 
want to know, why is the same little group of people participating in making 
all the money?" 
</P>
<P>
 During World Cup's early years, former executives worried that Rothenberg was 
trying to make money in a different way. 
</P>
<P>
 Two sources said that after one meeting with television executives, Rothenberg 
signed off on an invoice that would have paid his law firm, Latham & Watkins, 
for his time. After a meeting with Rothenberg and the law firm, the invoice was 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the recent pace of World Cup preparations, Rothenberg is still working 
for his firm. He was spotted in a federal courtroom recently, representing a 
client for the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "An old friend," Rothenberg said. BILL PLASCHKE

CALPERS TO INVEST IN AUSTRALIAN FUEL FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Public Employees Retirement System has made its first 
investment under a deal announced a year ago, apparently winning -- in tandem 
with Enron Corp. -- a bidding war for Bridge Oil Ltd., an Australian producer 
of oil and gas. 
</P>
<P>
 CalPERS, the nation's largest public pension fund, said last July that it 
would invest $250 million of its $75 billion in assets in a partnership with 
Houston-based Enron, the largest natural gas producer in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 Other pension funds have made direct investments like the Australian deal, but 
the CalPERS-Enron transaction is one of the largest ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "These (deals) are going to increase as (funds) look for different investments 
in their portfolios," predicted Foster H. Corwith, a first vice president with 
Dean Witter Reynolds. "There are opportunities here that you couldn't do with a 
straight retirement fund." 
</P>
<P>
 CalPERS fund managers say they hope to eventually have as much as 2% of their 
portfolio in such direct investments -- so called because they do not involve 
investment bankers and related fees. Pension funds traditionally invest in 
bonds, stocks or real estate, paying fees ranging from 2% to 5% of the value of 
the investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of our rationale for these sorts of direct placements are fee structures 
that are favorable to us," said Jed Maxwell, the fund's principal investment 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The takeover bid of 85 cents (Australian) per share for Bridge Oil beat an 
80-cent bid by Parker & Parsley Petroleum Co. of Midland, Tex., and brought the 
price for Bridge to about $263 million in U.S. dollars.

 Anything-to-Make-a-Buck Dept.: Craig Cook phoned his brother Barry in L.A. to 
report that a Ford dealership in Gainesville, Ga., "had -- first thing Saturday 
morning -- placed a white Bronco atop a ramp with a large sign reading: 'As 
seen on TV.' "

 Heart-warming but stomach-turning: Our mention of the woman who saved her 
unconscious parakeet's life with some timely mouth-to-beak resuscitation 
prompted a note from Virginia Abrams about a near-drowning at her house in 
Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was a garden lizard that "we rescued from the bottom of the 
swimming pool," Abrams said. "He looked like a goner -- he wasn't moving. My 
husband, Jack, immediately held him to release water from his lungs and, with 
my granddaughter and great-granddaughter looking on in amazement, he began 
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Soon his legs (the lizard's) began to move and we 
knew he was still alive. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Abrams adds, "And that's not all. A few weeks later, after we came home to 
find our litte pet box-turtle at the bottom of the pool in the same situation. 
. . ." 
</P>

 Precedent: Jack Crickard of Glendale, a retired Superior Court judge, writes 
that during a visit to Prescott, Ariz., he heard a television announcer say 
that a local couple's bridal registry was at a Tru-Value Hardware store.

<P>
 Crickard asks: "Does this ever happen in L.A.?" 
</P>
<P>
 We're proud to report that it has. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong's, a West L.A. hardware store, established a bridal registry in 
1992. One bride-to-be even listed among her hoped-for wedding gifts: Two cubic 
feet of dung.

 Alas, nary a guest scooped it up for her.

 Several months after Linda Mann's shot of a post-earthquake sign ran in Only

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; SAUDIS PUT SCARE IN DUTCH; GROUP F: 
UNDERDOGS FINALLY FALL ONLY WHEN GOALKEEPER MAKES A LATE MISTAKE, 2-1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Sometimes, maybe, close does count. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, if you're a soccer-poor nation from the Middle East fighting 
European power and arrogance, maybe you can lose and still win. 
</P>
<P>
 A giddy team from Saudi Arabia believes this is possible. 
</P>
<P>
 A exhausted, disoriented team from the Netherlands wonders if the Saudis 
aren't right. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Dutch defeated the Saudis, 2-1, in a first-round World Cup match Monday 
night at RFK Stadium, then why were the Saudi princes smooching? 
</P>
<P>
 And why, an hour after the game, were the Dutch still having trouble catching 
their breath? Perhaps because the Saudis, judged the worst of the 24 World Cup 
teams, led the highly rated Netherlands for 31 of 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Then held them to a 1-all tie until the final five minutes of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they lost on a mistake by their goalie, which was followed immediately by 
a game-winning header by Gaston Taument. 
</P>
<P>
 And Saudis, we hate to add this, but you're going to find out soon or later. 
</P>
<P>
 Taument did it with his eyes closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised," admitted Taument, who entered the game in the middle of the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 So were his teammates, who couldn't believe something that appeared to be so 
easy could be so difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight was a case of a team from a nation that doesn't normally win gaining 
a certain power by going against a stronger team," Dutch defender Frank De Boer 
said. "When that happens, that power can be dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 And it could have been deadly to Holland's chances if Saudi goalie Mohammed Al 
Deayea, who stopped 27 of 29 shots, did not charge 10 yards from his goal and 
try to grab a fly ball and miss . 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this is what happened in those final minutes after De Boer kicked it in to 
his brother Ronald, who tried to score with his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald De Boer and Al Deayea collided, the ball bounced to the right off De 
Boer's noggin, and Taument's dreadlocked head knocked it into an empty net. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated 20,000 orange-covered Dutch among the 52,535 fans finally 
stopped their derisive whistling. Some of them even stopping hitting other fans 
over the head with inflated orange hammers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not so much a celebration as a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was almost very embarrassing," forward Bryan Roy said. "I mean, we are 
Holland." 
</P>
<P>
 The Saudis shrugged, calmly finished the game, then hugged everyone in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Deayea was made so physically ill by his mistake that he could not talk 
about it, but the rest of his delegation was thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Holland thought they would have an easy time with us," Saudi Coach Jorge 
Solari said. "We showed them something different." 
</P>
<P>
 Saeed Alahmed, a local student working with the Saudi team during its first 
World Cup finals appearance, added, "Today, in the eyes of our country, we have 
done enough. By scoring one goal, we did more than we ever hoped." 
</P>
<P>
 That goal, scored by Fuad Amin on a sneaky header between two Dutch defenders 
in the 19th minute, sent the Saudi delegation into a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Amin circled the stadium, waving to the fans. The Saudi coaches waltzed along 
the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 In their second-level box seats, several Saudi princes fell over each other 
while hugging and kissing. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a second, just a second, I thought, 'Oh no,' " Roy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those seconds turned to long minutes as the Saudis immediately went into their 
slowdown offense. They essentially stopped trying shots while all but two 
players fell back on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Then just when the Dutch would get their vaunted passing attack working, one 
of the Saudis would fall to the ground, writhing in pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after halftime, Wim Jonk took matters into his own feet by hammering a 
ball through three defenders from 35 yards to tie the score in the 50th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saudis attempted more slowdown tactics, including one particularly blatant 
maneuver by Hamzah Saeed Falatah with 20 minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 One second, he was laying on the sideline, clawing the grass in agony. The 
next second, he was leading the attack with a sprint. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of all they did, we had to rush, rush, rush," Roy said. "We had to 
push, so much, in this heat (86 degrees) that it will hurt us down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 If this means thoughts of the Saudis will cross Dutch minds when they are in 
the semifinals, well, then Solari thinks that Monday was a victory indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played like champions," he said, and it didn't sound odd when he said it.

ANOTHER TIMELY DODGER WALLOP; BASEBALL: WALLACH'S THREE-RUN HOMER IN THE EIGHTH 
INNING POWERS GROSS TO A 3-2 COMEBACK VICTORY OVER THE PADRES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes Tim Wallach seems to come out of nowhere, showing up at exactly the 
right time -- when the rest of the offense has quieted for a few innings, or 
maybe the whole game. 
</P>
<P>
 He made such an appearance Monday night, when, after the Dodgers had been 
stymied for 7 2/3 innings by the San Diego Padres' Joey Hamilton, he connected 
with the first pitch he saw and sent it over the left-center field fence. It 
gave the Dodgers all their runs in a 3-2 victory at Jack Murphy Stadium.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was an exciting moment," said Wallach, whose 17 home runs lead the team. 
"After struggling for three years, when you do something good, you get excited 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallach watched the ball leave the park and pumped his right fist as he 
rounded first base. It gave him 52 runs batted in this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care about home runs, but the runs I drive in," Wallach said. 
</P>
<P>
 But equally important to the club was the tenacity of starter Kevin Gross 
(6-4), who was shaky from the start but battled through seven innings. And Todd 
Worrell, although he pitched a shaky ninth inning, held the Padres the final 
two innings for his fourth save.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Gross: "I was sitting on the bench with Orel (Hershiser) when Eli came up 
to the plate and I said, 'He's been swinging good all night and has been 
swinging good anyway.' I said, 'How am I going to get a win out of this?' and 
before I could look up, he was going deep. He's a fantastic guy . . . . he 
deserves this season. I played with him in Montreal and here, and every guy in 
here loves him." 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell walked the leadoff batter in the ninth and hit Phil Plantier on the 
foot with a pitch, but got out of the inning on a double play and a ground ball 
to short. "I try to get the job done anyway I can," Worrell said. "I feel a lot 
better . . . . I'm throwing the ball well and got the breaks." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Wallach's homer, though, it wasn't a game for the Dodgers' highlight 
film: Gross going down like a boxer while successfully fielding a comebacker, 
and Mike Piazza tripping in slow motion as he went to throw out a runner. There 
was Brett Butler arguing a called third strike with plate umpire Ed Montague. 
</P>
<P>
 And Manager Tom Lasorda arguing with Montague after he called out Delino 
DeShields for interference in the basepaths. DeShields, returning to play for 
the first time since May 25, made an error in his first fielding chance, but by 
the fifth inning, he was taking away hits again. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlight films are sure to show Bip Roberts, who went three for four with a 
double and RBI, extending his hitting streak to 23 games, the longest in the 
majors and in the league since 1991, tying the Dodgers' Brett Butler. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the first seven innings, Hamilton (3-2), making his seventh major 
league start, held the Dodgers to six hits and one walk. But in the eighth, he 
walked Butler and then had an agonizing at-bat with Piazza, who represented the 
tying run. Piazza battled Hamilton to a 3-and-2 count, and, when he walked, 
Hamilton dropped to his knees for a moment.  
</P>
<P>
 But it was Hamilton's next pitch that decided the game, and when Wallach 
connected, there was little doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kinds of things happen when you're in first place," Gross said with a 
smile. 
</P>
<P>
 That Gross got out of the first two innings by giving up only one run is 
testimony to his tenacity and good fielding, by him and his teammates. Gross 
walked four during that time, filling the bases twice. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first inning, he got out of the inning with a double play. The Padres 
got two consecutive hits in the second inning before the Dodgers got another 
double play. But then Gross walked Hamilton, putting Eddie Williams in scoring 
position at second for Roberts, whose line drive to right field extended his 
streak and put the Padres ahead by 1-0.  
</P>
<P>
 It was after Gross walked Luis Lopez to load the bases for the second time in 
two innings that pitching coach Ron Perranoski made a trip to the mound. But 
left in to face Tony Gwynn, Gross fielded the comebacker, which he caught as he 
dropped to his knees.

JOHNSON COMES TO FORE AGAINST ANGELS; MARINERS: USUALLY OVERSHADOWED BY 
GRIFFEY, HE PITCHES THREE-HITTER IN 5-0 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Anyone seen Randy Johnson lately? He's a 6-foot-10 left-hander. Pitches for 
the Seattle Mariners. Long, stringy hair. Intimidating presence on the mound. 
You can't miss him, can you? 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who shut out the Angels, 5-0, Monday at Anaheim Stadium for his 
seventh victory in eight starts, finds himself pushed into the shadows by Ken 
Griffey Jr.'s torrid home run-hitting pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparisions to Babe Ruth have placed Griffey in the spotlight to the 
exclusion of every other Mariner. Friday, Griffey homered off Kansas City's 
David Cone, hitting his 30th home run earlier in the season than any man in 
major league history. 
</P>
<P>
 So it figured that it would take something special to shove Johnson into the 
limelight Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-hit shutout with 11 strikeouts seemed to work OK for Johnson, 9-3 with 
a 3.28 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 And get this, Johnson said he didn't feel particularly sharp until the middle 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have anything in the bullpen (throwing before the game)," Johnson 
said. "The first couple of innings, I was kind of lethargic. Then I started 
getting more into the game. The first few innings, I didn't know how long I 
could go." 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle Manager Lou Piniella had another viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you this, he had no-hitter stuff," Piniella said after Johnson 
completed his fourth shutout in six starts. "My God, the three hits they got. . 
. . Two were bouncers up the middle and the other was a flair to right." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Angels managed nothing of substance against Johnson. Tim Salmon's 
first-inning single was the only clean hit they had and the only ball hit to 
the outfield until Chili Davis flied out to end the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary DiSarcina and Bo Jackson had infield singles up the middle. And J.T. Snow 
battled Johnson for a two-out walk in the eighth. But those four were the only 
Angel baserunners. 
</P>
<P>
 By the fourth inning, Johnson appeared almost unhittable. In the end, he threw 
111 pitches and almost every one appeared to baffle the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners gave Johnson a five-run lead without the benefit of a hit from 
Griffey, which ranked as something of a shock. Griffey walked twice, flied out 
twice and struck out. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel starter Joe Magrane (2-4) wasn't so lucky with Jay Buhner and Mike 
Blowers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third inning, Buhner hit a 1-and-1 pitch over the left-field wall for a 
two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Blowers' two-run single to center in the fifth pushed Seattle's lead to 4-0 
and it appeared the Mariners were on the verge of landing a knockout blow to 
Magrane. 
</P>
<P>
 When Magrane walked Edgar Martinez to load the bases with two out in the 
fifth, it marked his seventh walk of the game, a career high. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle extended its lead to 5-0 after Mitchell's bases-empty homer in the 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-run lead enabled Johnson to cruise the rest of the way. The pressure 
was off by then, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "His ball was really exploding all over the place," Piniella said. "His 
fastball was alive and his slider was biting." 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, the Angels recalled catcher Greg Myers from the disabled list, 
optioning Jorge Fabregas to triple-A Vancouver and keeping Chris Turner in the 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed a curious move, considering Fabregas was batting .283 and Turner 
.133. But apparently the Angels were more concerned about having two 
left-handed hitting catchers -- Myers and Fabregas -- than batting averages. 
</P>
<P>
 "The move with Fabregas, in the long run, will further his career," Angel 
Manager Marcel Lachemann said. "He just needs to catch. For him to be the 
player he can be, he needs to catch. To do what he's done at this level is 
excellent. To do what he needs to, he has to be at the triple-A level."

MARINERS' JOHNSON COMES TO FORE AGAINST ANGELS; BASEBALL: OVERSHADOWED FOR MUCH 
OF THE SEASON BY TEAMMATE GRIFFEY, LEFT-HANDER PITCHES THREE-HITTER IN 5-0 
VICTORY.

You can't miss him, can you? 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who defeated the Angels, 5-0, Monday at Anaheim Stadium for his 
seventh victory in eight starts, finds himself pushed into the shadows by Ken 
Griffey Jr.'s torrid home run-hitting pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparisons to Babe Ruth have placed Griffey in the spotlight to the exclusion 
of almost all other events surrounding the Mariners. Last Friday, Griffey 
homered against Kansas City's David Cone, hitting his 30th of the season faster 
than any other player in major league history.  
</P>
<P>
 So it took a three-hit shutout with 11 strikeouts from Johnson (9-3) to shift 
him into the limelight. It was his fourth shutout in six starts. 
</P>
<P>
 And get this, Johnson said he didn't feel particularly sharp until the middle

</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you this, he had no-hitter stuff," Seattle Manager Lou Piniella 
said. "My God, the three hits they got. . . . Two were bouncers up the middle

</P>
<P>
 The Angels managed nothing of substance against Johnson through six innings. 
Tim Salmon's first-inning single was their only clean hit and the only ball hit 
to the outfield until Chili Davis flied out to end the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary DiSarcina and Bo Jackson also reached first on infield singles up the 
middle. And J.T. Snow fought Johnson for a two-out walk in the eighth. Those 
were the only Angel baserunners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have anything in the bullpen (throwing before the game)," Johnson 
said. "The first couple of innings, I was kind of lethargic. Then I started 
getting more into the game. The first few innings, I didn't know how long I 
could go." 
</P>
<P>
 By the fourth, he appeared almost unhittable. In the end, he threw 111 pitches 
and each seemed to baffle the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson retired 13 in a row between singles by DiSarcina, in the third, and 
Jackson, in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every Angel at-bat seemed to be a mismatch, with Johnson clearly 
superior. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners gave Johnson a five-run lead after the top of the eighth without 
the benefit of a hit from Griffey, which ranked as something of a shock. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel starter Joe Magrane (2-4) kept Griffey, who can break a major league 
record if he hits his 31st home run before July 1, quiet in his first three 
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane wasn't so lucky with Jay Buhner and Mike Blowers, however. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third inning, Buhner slammed a 1-and-1 pitch over the left field wall 
for a two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Blowers' two-run single to center in the fifth pushed Seattle's lead to 4-0 
and it appeared the Mariners were on the verge of landing a knockout blow to 
Magrane. 
</P>
<P>
 When Magrane walked Edgar Martinez to load the bases with two out in the 
fifth, it marked his seventh walk of the game, a career high. 
</P>
<P>
 But he wriggled out of further trouble when he struck out Keith Mitchell to 
end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle extended its lead to 5-0 after Mitchell's bases-empty homer in the 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-run lead enabled Johnson to cruise the rest of the way. The pressure 
was off. 
</P>
<P>
 "His ball was really exploding all over the place," Piniella said. "His 
fastball was alive and his slider was biting. His fastball was really doing 
things at home plate." 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, the Angels recalled catcher Greg Myers from the disabled list, 
optioned Jorge Fabregas to triple-A Vancouver and kept Chris Turner in the 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed a curious move, considering Fabregas was batting .283 and Turner 
only .136. But apparently the Angels were more concerned about having two 
left-handed hitting catchers -- Myers and Fabregas.

NAVRATILOVA SAVORS APPLAUSE, ROMPS IN OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Her stomach queasy after a four-hour case of pre-tournament nerves, Martina 
Navratilova made yet another trip to Centre Court at Wimbledon on Monday and 
found herself serenaded by the soothing sound of applause. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was no ordinary ovation. This was for the nine singles championships. 
For the 22 years she has graced Wimbledon's stately courts. For her striking 
emotion, which has always been worn on her sweatbands. 
</P>
<P>
 So Navratilova, 37, who is retiring from full-time play at year's end, let the 
noise rain down on her. Oddly enough, it calmed her fears, allowing the 
fourth-seeded Navratilova to dispense quickly of England's Claire Taylor, 6-2, 
6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 This was Navratilova's 126th singles match at Wimbledon, Taylor's first as a 
senior player. As they walked onto the court, Navratilova turned to Taylor, 19, 
and told her to cherish the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Turn around and enjoy it," she said. "This doesn't happen very often." 
</P>
<P>
 The applause went on and on and Navratilova said she found herself thinking, 
"Wait, I haven't played yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Once she did play, things went as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, understandably nervous, committed numerous unforced errors. 
Navratilova took advantage of the inexperience and soon left with an easy 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I like grass and it likes me," Navratilova said. "My game suits it 
perfectly and I'm very happy playing here. So this is the setting for me, for 
my game, as well as my heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you know, that doesn't win matches. You still have to win that last 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova didn't survive the first round of the French Open and was beaten 
in a Wimbledon warm-up tournament at Eastbourne. Expectations were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 You wouldn't have known it Monday. She might have been the oldest competitor 
in the field, but she didn't play like it. Her only admission of age? An ice 
pack wrapped around her left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a bad wrist for three years now," she said. "But if I do this it 
feels better." 
</P>
<P>
 And if she continues to win, the people of Centre Court feel the same way. 
Happy. Healthy. Witnesses to Navratilova's final run at history and a 10th 
Wimbledon singles championship.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Thompson is going to watch Patrick Ewing try to lead the New York Knicks 
to the NBA title on Wednesday, but the Georgetown coach is not thinking about 
basketball. . . . "I can't get O.J. Simpson out of mind," Thompson said. "I'll 
focus on something for a little while, but my thoughts keep coming back to 
O.J." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 So do mine. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Probably yours, too. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, television, radio, and the newspapers won't let us forget about 
this enormous tragedy, even if we want to. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I was watching the U.S. Open playoff Monday when ABC interrupted its coverage 
to show Simpson's arraignment. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Somebody commented that it was routine court stuff. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The difference, though, was that this involved the most famous American ever 
to be charged with murder. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Not long after the network returned to the U.S. Open golf tournament, a Denver 
radio sports talk-show host called. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Irv Brown said that every call to his program the previous hour had been about 
Simpson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also said that these have not been the best of times for those idolized 
by Southern California fans, and he was right. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 First, a single-car auto accident left Hall of Fame jockey Bill Shoemaker, who 
was legally drunk, paralyzed. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Next, Hall of Fame-to-be guard Magic Johnson contracted HIV, the virus that 
leads to AIDS, acknowledged that he had been promiscuous, and announced his 
retirement at 32. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Then Hall of Fame pitcher Don Drysdale died of a heart attack at 56. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Monday, the Hall of Fame tailback from USC, the Buffalo Bills and the San 
Francisco 49ers stood in a courtroom and pleaded not guilty to the murders of 
Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I could give no definitive answer to Brown when he asked me how long Simpson 
would be the main topic of conversation in L.A. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It would take a miracle for the United States to win the World Cup, but why 
can't we at least win the U.S. Open? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The most memorable shot of the day was a miss -- the near-miss, 20-foot putt 
for par by Loren Roberts on the second hole of sudden death. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Look-alikes: Colin Montgomerie and Bill Parcells; Ernie Els and Liam Neeson. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 The Cleveland Indians have the second-best record in baseball. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Funny, but the Raiders have a lot more success against the Denver Broncos than 
the Dodgers have against the Colorado Rockies. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The 1941 Yankees, whose record of home runs in 25 consecutive games was tied 
by the Detroit Tigers, featured Joe DiMaggio.He had 30 home runs that year. 
Charlie (King Kong) Keller led the team with 33, and Tommy Henrich had 31. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Frank Thomas, Rafael Palmeiro, Will Clark, Jeff Bagwell, Andres Galarraga, 
Gregg Jefferies and Fred McGriff are making this the year of the first baseman. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 At the start of this week, the Dodgers had 69 home runs and 323 runs batted 
in. The Angels had 68 home runs and 323 RBIs. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If you have pitched one shutout in the National League this season, you are 
only one away from the league lead. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Scouring the box scores every morning is even more fun than usual because of 
all the big numbers being compiled by batters. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Don't look for a rematch of the 1992 American League championship series 
between the Toronto Blue Jays and Oakland Athletics. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 What a pleasant surprise the injured Delino DeShields' replacement, Garey 
Ingram, turned out to be for the Dodgers. He hit for a higher average in 26 
games than last year in 84 games for San Antonio of the Texas League. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Baseball Coach Andy Lopez, who has left for Florida, will be missed by 
Pepperdine. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Morrison fights more often outside the ring than Riddick Bowe does 
inside the ring. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, 400-meter hurdler Kevin Young and 400-meter runner Quincy Watts 
won Olympic gold medals. Since then, they have left coach John Smith. Last 
weekend, Young failed to qualify for the finals in the national meet and Watts 
didn't even compete. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Bonilla's horses are having even less success than his baseball team. In 
their racing debuts, horses co-owned by the Met third baseman finished seventh 
and eighth during the weekend at Hollywood Park. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Don't worry about the Coliseum being ready for the NFL exhibition season 
because all five of the Raiders' games are out of town, although one will be as 
near as Anaheim. . . . At least you can't accuse soccer of using juiced-up 
balls.

 The New York Islanders appointed assistant Lorne Henning head coach on Monday, 
replacing Al Arbour, who retired after the NHL season.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; BRAZIL'S VICTORY NEEDS NO EXPLANATION; 
GROUP B: FAVORITES IMPRESSIVE IN OPENING 2-0 VICTORY OVER RUSSIA, AND ARE 
EXPECTED TO IMPROVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After his team's World Cup opener against Brazil, Russian Coach Pavel Sadyrin 
had little analysis to offer. The loss, he said, was "more or less 
explainable." He did not elaborate. Nor was it necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The less of it was that the Russians were so overmatched that they were 
fortunate to leave Stanford Stadium while the scoreboard still showed only 2-0 
in favor of the Brazilians. 
</P>
<P>
 End of story? 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite. Whereas the Russians no doubt were eager to start looking ahead to 
their next first-round game, against Sweden, the Brazilians wanted to savor 
their victory as long as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the teams in the 24-team World Cup tournament, perhaps none is under 
more pressure than Brazil. Not only do Brazilian fans expect their team to win 
the World Cup, they demand it.  
</P>
<P>
 They are so demanding that, even though Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira has put 
together a team that most experts contend is the favorite, he was booed in 
Monday's pregame introductions. And the overwhelming majority of the crowd of 
81,061 was Brazilian. 
</P>
<P>
 So Parreira was glad to be able to calm them for at least one afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "In spite of (a score of) just two-nil, Brazil's advantage was very big," 
Parreira said. "Not at any time did I feel Brazil was threatened." 
</P>
<P>
 He also had some ominous words for his team's next opponent, Cameroon. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, Brazil is the only team in the competition that had the ability to 
hold the ball throughout the game," he said. "Certainly, Brazil is going to 
raise its level further in the games to come." 
</P>
<P>
 No one could argue on this day that Parreira had not made all the right moves, 
but then a lot of coaches would look like geniuses with his players. After his 
exquisite forward, Romario, placed a shot into the right corner of the net 
after a corner kick in the 26th minute to give Brazil a 1-0 lead, Russian 
goalkeeper Dmitri Kharine could only shake his head in admiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, Romario is a Brazilian, and he plays extraordinary," Kharine 
said later. "A European player would have tried to score in a different corner. 
So he used a different approach." 
</P>
<P>
 With Romario and Bebeto, Brazil has the best forward combination in the 
tournament. Sadyrin tried to neutralize them with three defenders, but the 
Russians did not have the quickness necessary and decided early that they would 
have to resort to thuggery. 
</P>
<P>
 Such tactics sometimes distract Romario and Bebeto, but that was not the case 
Monday. The referee, An Yan Lim Kee Chong of Mauritius, was often overmatched, 
but he eventually caught on and dispensed three second-half yellow cards to the 
Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 He also granted the first penalty kick of the four-day-old tournament, calling 
defender Vladislav Ternavsky for tackling Romario from behind in the penalty 
area in the 53rd minute. Ternavsky earlier got away with wrestling Romario down 
in the penalty area, but not this time. Midfielder Rai did the honors and 
easily beat Kharine to the right corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor Ternavsky. This is the third time this year that he has been called upon 
to mark Romario. The first two times, he was playing for Spartak Moscow against 
Romario's FC Barcelona team, and although this might have been Ternavsky's best 
game against him, it will not be one he will want to recall in his memoirs. As 
a final indignity, he was called upon afterward to submit to drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Romario and Bebeto can make even the best of defenders look flat-footed. 
Brazil's fans were concerned about the midfield, where Rai, the captain, has 
been little better than sufficient, and the defense, where injuries have 
struck. 
</P>
<P>
 No less an expert than Pele said recently that Brazil had much individual 
talent but little organization. 
</P>
<P>
 That was not the case Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rai found space in the midfield with the same creativity that he used in 1992, 
when he was considered among the world's best playmakers, and the defense was 
superb. To compensate for the lost defenders, Parreira substituted players who 
could handle the ball like midfielders. Not only did they easily parry Russia's 
few well-conceived counterattacks, they often initiated attacks of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, there was a flow to Brazil's game that was not present during the 
1990 World Cup in Italy, where the former coach, Sebastiao Lazaroni, insisted 
that his team establish its defensive credentials. Parreira said last week that 
his team will protect its end of the field, but will not betray its followers 
throughout the world who expect Brazil to play its traditional jogo bonito , 
beautiful game. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, he is a man of his word.

 GROUP D at Foxboro Stadium, Foxboro, Ma. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina vs. Greece 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ESPN, Univision, KSCI (Greek) 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: Once again, the world will be watching Diego Maradona in this 
best-of-times opener for the Argentines, and worst-of-times debut for the 
rookie Greeks.Playing in their first Cup after nearly seven decades of trying, 
it will take a miracle for Greece to survive the opening round in a group that 
also includes Nigeria and Bulgaria. The Argentines, by contrast, should cruise 
through, although they appear to have lost a step since their 1990 second-place 
finish. Maradona, 33, says he's fit. So, too, are Argentine strikers who play 
their club soccer in Italy: Roma's Abel Balbo and Claudio Caniggia, and 
Fiorentina's Gabriel Batistuta. That trio should prove too much for a no-name 
Greek defense playing around 35-year-old keeper Antonis Minou. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: The Argentines had qualifying problems and their usual spate of 
feuds and rancor on their way to the Cup. Still, look for Maradona and fellow 
midfielders Leonardo Rodrigues and Diego Simeone to gain quick control of a 
game that will be mostly played at Argentina's pace -- and on Greece's end of 
the field. Argentine keeper Sergio Goycochea, hero of Italia '90, is back, 
symbol of an Argentine defense that is aging and suspect to quick, vigorous 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: If you've a mind to celebrate ethnically, hold the feta . Order 
steak. Argentina by at least two goals, but if the Greeks lose their poise it 
could be a rout. WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO

 GROUP D at the Cotton Bowl, Dallas 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria vs. Nigeria 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 4:35 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ESPN2, Univision, (ESPN tape, 10:25) 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: Dimitar Penev, Bulgaria's coach, would not say Monday whether 
he will use two or three forwards.But most likely the Bulgarians will rely on 
Hristo Stoichkov's deadly left foot on counterattacks. Although Stoichkov, who 
plays for BC Barcelona, has a slight hamstring pull, he should be ready. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulgarians will have to be cautious against the African champions. If 
teen-age midfielders Sunday Oliseh and Austin Okocha can control their 
counterparts, Nigeria has the firepower to explode. Striker Rashidi Yekini is 
poised to emerge as one of the stars of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Bulgaria has yet to win a World Cup match in six appearances, three 
with Penev as a central forward. After its dramatic qualifying victory over 
France last November in Paris, Bulgarians are hoping for a new era of Balkan 
soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigeria, on the other hand, will make its World Cup debut with great 
expectations after Cameroon's quarterfinal finish in 1990. So, each team is 
under pressure to perform, but particularly the favored Africans. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: The Bulgarians know the reputation of the Super Eagles, and hope 
they can sneak up on them with one of Europe's most potent attacks. We think 
they will. Bulgaria, 2-1. ELLIOTT ALMOND

 One of soccer's more sportsmanlike traditions has continued during the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 When a player is injured away from the ball and the referee is slow to stop 
play, his teammates will kick the ball out of bounds to force a stoppage and 
allow for medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
 When play is resumed, the team throwing the ball in tosses it to the team 
whose player was hurt. EMILIO GARCIA-RUIZ

 A World Cup pop quiz: 
</P>
<P>
 Question: When is a sports injury not an injury? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: When it happens to a soccer player. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday at Palo Alto, Brazilian defender Jorginho was involved in a collision 
with Russia's Dmitri Klehstov in the 65th minute. Jorginho went down, curled in 
that well-rehearsed soccer injury fetal position. He writhed and grimaced. The 
medical people dashed to his side. They rolled out the golf cart. They loaded 
him on. He continued to writhe and grimace. When they delivered him to the 
sideline, he was surrounded by more medical people and helpers. Less than a 
minute later, he was up, on the sideline, and back in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 And they said Brando was a great actor. BILL DWYRE

 About 200 people in Bangladesh reportedly smashed windows at two electrical 
stations after a power failure cut off the telecast of the U.S.-Switzerland 
game. Two Bangladesh power plant employees were said to be injured in a 
separate attack by fans angered by an electrical outage.

 * "Keep the TV down low," the People's Daily in China said in a front-page 
commentary. "When you see a great goal, keep your emotions under control. Don't 
shout loudly or applaud. You must especially guard against accidents happening 
because of lack of sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 * Indeed, lack of sleep may have killed a coffee shop owner in Macao, a 
Portuguese colony on southern China's tip. Lo Chon-yin collapsed Sunday while 
serving customers, according to news reports quoting his wife. She said Lo, 37, 
had stayed up two consecutive nights to watch World Cup games on television 
after working all day. 
</P>
<P>
 * For bank robbers in Chiang Mai, Thailand, the World Cup is good for 
business. They reportedly made off with $40,000 in two safes when the guard 
abandoned his post after midnight to watch a game on TV.

 While fans of American's pastime debate whether the baseball is juiced, at 
least one World Cup player thinks the soccer ball in use here has been altered. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgian goalkeeper Michel Preud'homme said he thinks the ball has been reduced 
in size, perhaps to increase scoring for Americans who might not appreciate 
low-scoring soccer games. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball is different than in previous competitions. It's smaller and it goes 
faster," he said. "The goalkeeper must adapt. It puts some restraint on the 
play of the goalkeeper." HELENE ELLIOTT

Claudio Reyna underwent an MRI test Monday to his right hamstring that showed a

 Andres Cavelier, a correspondent for the Bogota, Colombia, daily El Tiempo, 
wrote about covering the World Cup alongside a novice American reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day of the inauguration in Chicago, I was assigned to press seat number 
298.Next to me was a gringo reporter. Dark glasses, a Chicago Bulls cap, 
chewing gum and with a pale face, almost white. I would still like to know if 
that was the natural color of his skin, or if the fright at having to cover a 
soccer game for the first time in history made his skin turn as white as milk. 
He was friendly, that's for sure. Immediately began talking to me -- in 
English, confused by this Colombian's gringo looks. He was so frank that he 
immediately confessed that he had never ever covered an international soccer 
game.  
</P>
<P>
 "He also confessed to having taken part in the campaign begun in this country 
a while back to change the rules of soccer. 'You have to make it more 
entertaining. One or two goals a game isn't worth it,' he said. And he went on 
talking about how the out-of-bounds ought to be abolished and how the size of 
the goal ports ought to grow. In other words, adapt the soccer that is played 
in more than 150 countries to 'Soccer Made in the USA.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never forget my colleague's first observation: 'What a jerk!' he said of 
a fan who, upon catching a stray ball, returned it to the field -- just as the 
law of soccer requires. I understood that my colleague is used to covering 
baseball. I kept my smiles to myself. 'Cavelier,' I told myself, 'welcome to 
the World Cup 1994.' "

 "Our system has a lot of options.We can change, and whether members of the

made much difference. We created seven or eight scoring opportunities against a 
team that was tactically set up very well for us.

 "Our system is sound, it has been in place for too long. It was not a question 
of players obeying us or not obeying us. They know when they do well and it is

concentration on an individual level." MATT WHITE

 Ireland Coach Jack Charlton, irate that his players didn't get enough water 
breaks during their 1-0 victory over Italy on Saturday at steamy Giants 
Stadium, said he would file a letter of complaint with FIFA asking for more 
opportunities for players "to swill a bit down." 
</P>
<P>
 Charlton, anticipating it will be as hot and more humid when Ireland faces 
Mexico on Friday at the Florida Citrus Bowl, is specifically asking for relief 
for his central midfielders and central defenders, who can't dash over to the 
sideline for a drink without leaving the team short-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example of the consequences, he cited Norwegian players who veered 
toward the sideline for a drink Sunday at Washington, and were almost 
victimized by a Mexican offensive attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a meeting, if they decided to have a minute break for TV, you know they 
would have had it," Charlton said Monday. "It's easy to give people water when 
they're on the sides. We even sent somebody to the other side of the field -- 
we were told we could do that by a FIFA representative -- but the security 
people wouldn't let him near the touchline.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to play Mexico and it could be 100 degrees or more in a stadium 
that's got 50 acres of concrete and I can't get water to the lads. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just for us. For the Mexicans, too. Ten, 15 seconds a couple or 
three times each half. That's all I want. Whether we'll get that I don't know. 
I had five players in the first half who never had a drink for the first 
three-quarters of an hour. . . . If we've got to come and play in temperatures 
like this, at least we've got to be fair to the players. I'm not prepared to 
put the players at risk." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wonder why he is complaining," FIFA spokesman Guido Tognoni said. "He won 
and he is the only coach to complain. If he has not enough fluids for his 
players, he should arrange for more." HELENE ELLIOTT

 Charlton said Irish forward Tommy Coyne suffered from dehydration during the 
game against Italy, and Coyne had the additional misfortune of being chosen for 
random drug testing. He said the testing process took an unreasonably long time 
and Coyne spent about an hour sitting in his sweaty uniform until being told he 
was permitted to shower. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlton said Coyne, flooded with water after being dehydrated, needed a 
wheelchair to board the team's plane to Florida, became ill during the flight, 
and needed help to disembark. His condition is being monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was picked (for testing) four times in 1966 at Wembley and it took me an 
hour each time. Tommy sat there for three hours," said Charlton, who starred 
for England in its 1966 World Cup triumph. HELENE ELLIOTT

 From Chicago's Spanish-language paper, La Raza: 
</P>
<P>
 "Spain comes to Chicago with a team that many consider could create a great 
upset for Germany (today at Soldier Field). 
</P>
<P>
 "(Coach) Javier Clemente has changed the domination of Real Madrid for the 
more aggressive Barcelona. In the team competing in the World Cup, nine players 
are from Barcelona and only two from Real Madrid. He has improved defensive 
techniques and neglected forward development.  
</P>
<P>
 "Clemente is one of the most controversial figures to appear in Chicago. He is 
frank, opinionated and arrogant. His difficult temperament makes him unpopular 
to many Spanish fans." 
</P>
<P>
 So they hate him, but they expect his team to beat the defending champions. 
Interesting approach. MARTHA VARGAS-SEAGLE

 The Colombian government Monday announced a temporary ban on guns and liquor 
during World Cup games.Radio Caracol reported Colombians are prohibited from 
carrying their guns four hours before each game that Colombia plays, and two 
hours afterward. The measure is aimed at preventing soccer-related shootings in 
this heavily armed and violent country. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, dry laws will be in effect two hours before and two hours after 
each game. Alcohol cannot be sold or consumed in public. "This is so that when 
our national team wins, we can celebrate with clear heads and not have so many 
traffic deaths," Radio Caracol said.

 Louis Perea, a Colombian defender, said the team had seen the United States' 
tie with Switzerland, but did not immediately see any real likelihood that the 
U.S. style -- similar to the Romanians in its emphasis on deep defense -- would 
cause the Colombians to make major changes in Wednesday's game at the Rose 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been in these circumstances before," Perea said. "We've been together 
too long and we have confidence in our system." 
</P>
<P>
 It could become an unfamiliar situation, however. Colombia has never lost 
consecutive games in international play. MATT WHITE

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; JOHNSON CAUSES SHAKEUP IN LINEUP

 Stressing that it was simply a one-game move to counter Seattle left-hander 
Randy Johnson, Manager Marcel Lachemann moved designated hitter Chili Davis to 
left field for Monday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann didn't want regular left fielder Jim Edmonds, a left-handed hitter, 
facing Johnson and didn't want Bo Jackson playing left in consecutive games. 
So, Davis trotted out to left, Jackson was the designated hitter and Edmonds, 
nursing a bruised right shoulder, did not start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told (Jackson), 'It's no slam on you,' " Lachemann said. "But I think Chili 
can get to some balls he can't. (Jackson) is working on a thing (an artificial 
hip) that most of us wouldn't be walking on. This is just a day we wanted to 
get Bo's bat in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are 17-17 when Jackson, batting .276 with seven home runs and 29 
runs batted in before Monday, is in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis is batting a team-leading .338 and having one of the finest seasons of 
his career, but he hadn't started in the outfield since he played right field 
on Sept. 3, 1992, when he was a member of the Minnesota Twins. And he hadn't 
started in left since his first stint with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't make a big deal out of it," said Davis, the Angel DH in 66 of 70 games 
this season. "I've been out there before."

 Sporting two false front teeth to replace the ones he lost, catcher Jorge 
Fabregas was still dazed from a fourth-inning collision with Darrin Jackson of 
the Chicago White Sox on Sunday. His mouth was still swollen and sore Monday. 
The teeth are temporary, to be replaced by permanent ones after the All-Star 
break. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little dazed," said Fabregas, who was optioned to triple-A Vancouver 
when Greg Myers was activated from the disabled list. "I don't remember too 
much. In an emergency, I would play. Once the swelling goes down, I'll be all 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Fabregas recalls being hit square in the mouth by Jackson's helmet as Jackson 
came sliding into home plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a low throw and I went to get it," he said. "He slid and came up. 
I hate for this to happen now. Hopefully, the swelling goes down so I can get 
my mask over it." ELLIOTT TEAFORD

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; INDIANS EXTEND THEIR STREAK, END TIGERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The only streak Cleveland starter Charles Nagy was worried about Monday night 
at Detroit was his own. And he didn't have reason to be optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Nagy pitched well and ended one streak -- well, two if you count his -- 
and continued another as the torrid Cleveland Indians defeated Detroit, 7-1, 
ending the Tigers' consecutive home run string at 25 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit shares the major league record with the 1941 New York Yankees, who 
also homered in 25 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Whitaker was the only Tiger to come close to hitting a homer, lifting a 
fly to the edge of the warning track in the first. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't beat the record," Whitaker said. "But, hey, we joined some good 
company." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1941 Yankees' 25-game streak came during Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting 
streak. DiMaggio homered 10 times during the 25-game homer streak. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time anything good had happened to Nagy (6-3) in Tiger 
Stadium. He was 0-2 with a 14.63 earned-run average in his previous two starts 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Murray drove in four runs to lift the Indians to their 10th consecutive 
victory, their longest winning streak since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 6, Baltimore 5 -- Right-hander Bill Wegman struggled but stayed 
unbeaten, getting two-run homers from Greg Vaughn and Dave Nilsson in the first 
inning and hanging on for a victory at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Wegman (5-0) now has more wins -- in 10 starts -- than he had in 1993, when he 
was 4-14 in an injury-plagued season. He went 5 1/3 innings, gave up four runs 
on eight hits, and walked five and struck out two. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn's 15th homer -- and third in three at-bats -- came against Jamie Moyer 
(2-5). Vaughn, who homered in his last two at-bats at New York Sunday, saw his 
streak end when he grounded into a double play in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 4, Toronto 1 -- The Red Sox ended their 11-game losing streak with a 
victory at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Hesketh (4-4) gave up three singles in seven shutout innings, stopping 
Boston's longest losing string since 1932. John Valentin homered and drove in 
three runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Dawson nearly brawled with Blue Jay pitcher Todd Stottlemyre. Dawson was 
nearly hit in the left shoulder by a pitch from Stottlemyre (5-4) in the sixth, 
shortly after Valentin homered. Dawson picked up the ball and threw it over 
Stottlemyre's head into center field. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time up, in the eighth, Dawson was hit on the left elbow by a pitch 
from Stottlemyre. Dawson took a couple of steps toward the mound but stopped as 
the benches emptied. 
</P>
<P>
 Stottlemyre was ejected by plate umpire Rick Reed, and threw water coolers and 
a large Gatorade bucket onto the field. Toronto Manager Cito Gaston also was 
ejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 12, Chicago 6 -- Ivan Rodriguez hit a go-ahead, two-run double as the 
Rangers scored seven runs in the eighth inning to win at Chicago and end a 
six-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 White Sox starter Jack McDowell took a 6-2 lead into the eighth, but for the 
third consecutive start the Cy Young winner got no decision when the bullpen 
couldn't hold on. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 7, Minnesota 5 -- Pinch-hitter Daryl Boston hit Rick Aguilera's first 
pitch for a three-run homer in the eighth inning to rally the Yankees at New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Twins built a 5-2 lead with three runs in the sixth, when Kirby Puckett 
and Dave Winfield homered.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; PERRANOSKI SPOTS DREIFORT'S PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pitching coach Ron Perranoski has worked a lot with Darren Dreifort recently, 
and believes he has pinpointed some of the areas that have caused Dreifort's 
inconsistency. Along with working on mechanics and an off-speed breaking ball, 
Perranoski said he is helping Dreifort get to know himself and what he is 
capable of doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He needs to extend himself out in front more and needs to use the upper part 
of his body," Perranoski said. "We really didn't change all that much. We went 
through his delivery and his angle discipline is the No. 1 thing. I don't want 
him pitching too fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort pitched in a simulated game recently and he and Perranoski also 
reviewed video of an inning Dreifort pitched four games ago, when he gave up a 
run and two hits. It was Dreifort's first appearance since June 11, after which 
Perranoski began to work intently with him.  
</P>
<P>
 "He has so much potential and is such a a good kid to work with, it's 
important to try and keep his confidence level up," Perranoski said. "He was 
starting to become concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort, 21, was acclaimed as the best amateur player in the country last 
year, when, at Wichita State University, he had a 11-1 record and 2.48 
earned-run average with 120 strikeouts and only 34 walks in 102 innings. But 
Perranoski points out that just because Dreifort has struggled this season 
doesn't mean he's lost his talent.  
</P>
<P>
 "In college, they are going to swing at a lot of balls, and (Dreifort) is 
capable of throwing the ball by anybody, both balls and strikes," Perranoski 
said. "Up here, players won't swing as much, or they will foul them off. This 
is an adjustment pitching up here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 X-rays on Tom Candiotti's right big toe were negative and he is scheduled to 
pitch tonight. Orel Hershiser will pitch Wednesday in the final game of the 
series. . . . Reporters were kidding Chris Gwynn about the number of times he 
has been asked the obvious question, "How does it feel to play against your 
brother, Tony?" Not accepting a pat answer, Gwynn came up with this one: "It's 
always fun because he plays, and I get to sit here and watch." MARYANN HUDSON

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; MERCKER GETS BRAVES BACK ON TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Atlanta starter Kent Mercker was intent on giving the Braves' bullpen a little 
rest Monday night at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't get the complete game he wanted, but he did go 7 1/3 strong innings 
as the Braves snapped a two-game losing streak with a 7-3 victory over the New 
York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the bullpen needed a break after the last two days," Mercker said, 
referring to the Braves being outscored, 28-4, by Cincinnati on Saturday and 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy with the way I threw," Mercker said. "I don't look at the pitch 
count. I just try to get the hitters out." 
</P>
<P>
 Mercker (6-1) gave up three runs and four hits, struck out nine and walked one 
in improving to 4-0 in his career against the Mets. He left with one out in the 
eighth after giving up a leadoff homer to Tim Bogar. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest with you I didn't feel tired," said Mercker, who threw 126 
pitches -- 91 for strikes. "I didn't feel hot. The ball got up the last couple 
of innings." 
</P>
<P>
 David Justice hit a three-run homer in the fourth, his 11th homer, to erase a 
2-0 Met lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mets' Bobby Jones (7-6) gave up five runs and seven hits in five innings. 
It was his first setback on the road this year, after going 4-0 in five 
previous starts. 
</P>
<P>
 The umpires worked the game in shorts and T-shirts because their equipment had 
not arrived from St. Louis, where they worked a game on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 8, St. Louis 4 -- Larry Walker and Wil Cordero each had four hits and 
homered in a five-run seventh inning as the Expos rallied to win at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker led off the seventh with his 10th homer off Rob Murphy (2-3) to tie the 
score 4-4. One out later, Cordero hit his seventh homer into the left-field 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Expos, who have hit 26 home runs in June, got 18 hits in ending a 
three-game losing streak. They also sent the Cardinals to their sixth loss in 
seven games, knocking them below .500 for only the second time all season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordero, who had the second four-hit game of his career, is 17 for 29 in the 
last seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 Expo starter Pedro Martinez lasted five innings and gave up four runs on seven 
hits. He struck out six but hit two batters, his league-leading ninth and 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal starter Rick Sutcliffe labored through 5 2/3 innings, throwing 101 
pitches and giving up three runs -- two earned -- and nine hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 5, Colorado 4 -- Jeff Bagwell and Scott Servais hit two-run homers for 
the Astros, helping Doug Drabek post his 10th victory in a game twice delayed 
by rain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Astros won at Denver for the first time in eight tries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Pittsburgh, the Pirates were leading 3-1 with none out in the top of the 
fifth inning when the game was called because of rain. It will be made up as 
part of a Sept. 23 doubleheader.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; A GIANT CLASH OVER RECORD COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After successfully launching the Eagles' "Hell Freezes Over" tour, Irving 
Azoff isn't taking it easy. Sources say his partnership with Time Warner Inc. 
is headed for a breakup. 
</P>
<P>
 Azoff's around-the-clock work for the Eagles has strained his relations with 
the media conglomerate, which was already unhappy with their joint venture, 
Giant Records. Sources look for the two sides to part sooner rather than later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it's real comfortable for Irving there now," said one 
industry associate. "If someone wants to come along and buy Giant, I'm sure 
Time Warner would have a perked-up ear." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Azoff and Time Warner Music Group Chairman Robert Morgado have 
already held preliminary divorce talks but remain miles apart on the terms. 
Morgado is said to be demanding a multimillion-dollar settlement to release 
Azoff from the final three years of their Giant agreement. In response, 
colleagues say Azoff is considering legal action. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgado, who has been described as openly hostile toward the Giant joint 
venture, declined to comment. He referred all calls to the Warner Bros. Records 
unit, which also had no response. While he was equally silent on the issue, 
Azoff is known to be furious at Time Warner for refusing to release an Eagles 
reunion album, which has been tied up in litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a real dilemma," said one knowledgeable source. "He's with a company 
that clearly doesn't want him but that also might not let him go so easily 
unless the price is right." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All that tension hardly makes for beautiful music. Though Azoff is regarded as 
a shrewd deal maker, critics say the 4-year-old Giant is an underachiever. 
High-profile acts such as Hammer have not paid off for the label. Giant's 
biggest sellers include "Common Thread," a rehash of Eagles songs by country 
music stars that reached No. 3 on the Billboard Top 200 chart, and the 
soundtrack to "New Jack City." Said one industry source: "You can't build a 
label on those records like you can with a hot new act." 
</P>
<P>
 Azoff's supporters say the label still has outperformed most start-ups, and 
they point to "Common Thread" and discoveries such as "Big Head Todd & the 
Monsters" as evidence of its viability. On a personal level, friends say Azoff 
is having one of his best years, with the Eagles show doing banner business and 
his merchandising company handling such big summer events as the Eagles and 
"Lollapalooza" tours. 
</P>
<P>
 It's too soon to say where Azoff might land. Some colleagues assume his deal 
will be picked up by Bertelsmann Music Group, which distributes Giant overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent speculation also had Azoff in talks with Ronald O. Perelman, whose New 
World Communications Group has cut a wide path through Hollywood recently by 
signing rapid-fire television deals with Fox Inc. and former NBC programming 
kingpin Brandon Tartikoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Azoff and Perelman, who are longtime friends, were spotted having lunch at the 
Grill in Beverly Hills two weeks ago. In a recent interview, New World Chief 
Executive William C. Bevins confirmed that the company is considering a music 
investment, but he declined to comment on Azoff specifically. Behind the 
scenes, sources say New World has hired star record industry lawyer John 
Branca, whose clients include Michael Jackson, as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding Azoff to his camp and striking a music distribution deal would give 
Perelman entree to the record business, much as the Tartikoff deal raised New 
World's profile in television. Sources say Azoff would go into business with 
Perelman "in a minute." New World declined to comment. Publicly, Azoff said: 
"Ron Perelman and I are friends. I have great admiration for him." But people 
close to the executives consider a deal unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perelman is interested in record business, but not at Azoff's level," said 
one source. "He wants to buy something like (record giant) Thorn EMI."

 As the summer box office shakeout continues, the weekend brought good news for 
one studio on the rocks and bad news for another trying for a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia Pictures finally emerged from its long slump with "Wolf," which took 
in about $18 million. The sophisticated horror tale starring Jack Nicholson and 
Michelle Pfeiffer was seen as a must-succeed movie for the studio, which has 
had a slow year. Lisbeth R. Barron, an S.G. Warburg analyst, estimates Wolf 
will take in $75 million domestically, based on its performance to date. 
</P>
<P>
 MGM had the opposite experience with "Getting Even With Dad." The perennially 
troubled studio hoped the Macaulay Culkin-Ted Danson comedy would mark its 
return (Culkin even appealed for people to support the movie on an MGM preview 
reel shown at the ShoWest convention in Las Vegas earlier this year), but the 
weekend box office was only $5.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Barron projects that "Getting Even With Dad" will max out at about $20 million 
domestically. Management at MGM was startlingly quick to disown the movie in 
the wake of its failure, pointing out that it was greenlit by the old regime. 
The new MGM brass, a popular group that still has the strong support of its 
colleagues in Hollywood, now has its summer hopes riding on "Blown Away," a 
Tommy Lee Jones-Jeff Bridges thriller. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 MCA Records has a serious case of Jimi Hendrix-itis. Over the past 12 months, 
the company has put out four packages by the late rock legend. A boxed set of 
studio albums came out with a greatest hits release, "The Ultimate Experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Then came an album of mostly unheard Hendrix blues songs. Now comes word that 
MCA is putting out "Jimi Hendrix: Woodstock," showcasing his performances from 
the seminal music festival. Timed to coincide with Woodstock's 25th 
anniversary, it includes an essay by Hendrix scholar Michael Fairchild, who 
rhapsodizes that Hendrix made his guitar sound like "jet engine orgasms."

 Kid stuff: Financier Ronald O. Perelman's entertainment hiring binge 
continues. Perelman's Marvel Entertainment confirmed that it has hired top toy 
executive Bruce L. Stein as its president and chief operating officer.Stein is 
leaving his current job as president of Kenner Products, a unit of Hasbro, to 
replace Terry Steward, who becomes president and chief operating officer of the 
firm's Marvel Comics unit. Stein's hiring comes less than a week after Perelman 
hired Brandon Tartikoff, former Paramount Pictures chairman and NBC president, 
to head his New World Communications Group. Perelman owns 80% of Marvel, which 
boasts such characters as Spider-Man, X-Men and the Incredible Hulk. 
Separately, Marvel said it has reached an agreement with MCA to develop rides, 
shows and attractions based on Marvel characters at MCA's proposed Universal 
City Florida theme park, scheduled to open in 1999. JAMES BATES

undergoing an information revolution. New computer programs allow buyers -- 
and, in some cases, renters -- to get a look at many properties without ever 
moving away from their broker's computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers looking for a home or condo in the San Fernando Valley can enter just 
about any local real estate office and tap into the San Fernando Valley Assn. 
of Realtors' high-tech version of its Multiple Listing Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The Customized Real Estate Information System Network (CRIS NET) allows real 
estate agents and their clients to use a computer "mouse" to draw the 
boundaries of the neighborhoods they are most interested in. Because every 
property in L. A. County is coded through an on-line version of the Thomas 
Guide, buyers can get a listing of the homes in areas they are most interested 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 (Readers note: If you're unfamiliar with terms such as geocoded, baud, modem, 
mouse and interconnectivity -- you're not alone.) 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the mapping program, buyers can further narrow their choices by 
entering into the computer such variables as price, features, number of 
stories, architectural style, number of garage spaces and even whether a home 
has a view or not. Once the field of available homes is narrowed, local agents 
can "download" the information into their personal computers at lightning 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the tour begins. The new on-line MLS val system has up to 10 color photos 
of each home for sale. This allows buyers to take a tour of most homes without 
ever getting out of a chair. Agents can also print out these photos and create 
a portfolio of prospective homes to hand over to a would-be buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes it much easier to look for a home," said James A. Link, executive 
vice president of the San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors. In the not too 
distant future, he predicted, it won't even be necessary for buyers to leave 
their homes when looking to move. Link expects that eventually the association 
will make much of the MLS information available to the public through an 800- 
or 900-prefix computer modem number. 
</P>
<P>
 Making the MLS available to the public would be a revolution in its own right. 
While Link doesn't envision letting the public in on all the same on-line 
information that agents get, public access would be sure to change the way 
people look for homes. It would also mark something of an about-face by the 
association on this contentious issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The MLS could probably be described as the glue that holds together real 
estate brokers and groups such as the San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors. 
Buyers and sellers turn to the realtors because of the MLS and its 
comprehensive listing of homes and other property for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 When local movers tried to appropriate information from the Valley's MLS, the 
Valley brokers filed suit, and last year won a court victory to restrict access 
to the MLS. Despite the fact that thousands of MLS books are published in the 
Valley each week -- and then discarded -- a U. S. District Court judge ruled 
that it was illegal for non-brokers and agents to access the MLS via computer 
or by ferreting through trash bins for the purpose of getting business leads. 
</P>
<P>
 The monopoly over the MLS that realtors have enjoyed is facing an increasing 
number of challenges. Many observers are now predicting that realtors will lose 
their control over the MLS within the next few years as computers make it 
possible for anyone to access information about homes for sale. This helps 
explain why both the National Assn. of Realtors and California Assn. of 
Realtors are trying to stay competitive by updating the MLS and making it more 
high-tech. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Computer giant IBM has invested in a company called HomeView Realty Centers 
Inc., which is creating its own database of homes for sale. Other companies -- 
big and small -- are creating computer networks, complete with video tours of 
each listing. Prospective buyers in somS. markets can now view hundreds of 
homes by just sitting in front of a computer screen without their real estate 
agent nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer revolution is also changing the commercial real estate market. 
Cushman Realty Corp. of Los Angeles, in cooperation with computer consultant 
Armstrong Yawney Inc. of Walnut Creek, has developed a database and computer 
program to track primarily office space in Los Angeles and other cities where 
Cushman does business. 
</P>
<P>
 I was invited to view what John C. Cushman III described as "the show" several 
weeks ago. It was pretty impressive -- a virtual-reality, multimedia 
presentation, complete with holographic imaging, digitized forms and 
agreements, and 32,000 password levels. 
</P>
<P>
 We began our virtual-reality tour with a satellite photo file view of the 
United States, then a satellite view of California, Los Angeles and then a map 
of downtown L. A. Soon, we were at the foot of the Sanwa Bank Building looking 
up. A moment later, we were in the lobby of the building, checking out the 
amenities. There were even "movie previews" of the interiors, exteriors, views 
and floor plans. 
</P>
<P>
 For you techies out there, the configuration is 4D SQL Server, Sybase, 4D 
Draw, Graph 3D, Ethernet, IBM RS 6000 Server. 
</P>
<P>
 All this tech talk points to a revolution in the way that real estate is sold, 
leased and managed. Cushman intends its system to eventually include full text 
of all the leases it has negotiated and all sorts of other data to help tenants 
and landlords keep an eye on each other.

 PHANTOM NUMBERS: "Phantom of the Opera" arrives at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center next month, and officials at the Costa Mesa center say 
there are plenty of dollar signs to spread around from it. . . . A sample: an 
expected $1.1 million in sales tax revenue, plus $15 million infused into the 
local economy. That's based on the 153,000 people they say will see the 
musical, which runs from July 22 to Sept. 4. In Denver, the show also paid out 
$68,000 a week in local labor costs.

 PLAYING CHICKEN: Shareholders who attended the annual meeting Monday of CKE 
Restaurants Inc. -- that's the brand new name for Carl Karcher Enterprises (D6) 
-- were given free meal coupons for the Boston Chicken restaurant of their 
choice. Only problem: Boston Chicken's first Southern California location 
doesn't open until July 25. . . . It will be in a former Carl's Jr. at Garfield 
Avenue and Brookhurst Street in Fountain Valley. CKE plans to open as many as 
300 Boston Chicken restaurants during the next five years.

 DAUGHTER'S DAY: To win Miss California, Jennifer Hanson got a little help from 
Alabama. Hanson, a Fullerton College student, sang "Since I Fell for You" at 
the weekend pageant in Fresno. The number was arranged by her father, Larry 
Hanson, who is lead guitarist for country music's Alabama. Hanson, 20, is a 
music major and a Rams cheerleader who had also won the Miss Garden Grove 
contest. She moves to San Diego for immediate training for the Miss America 
contest Sept. 17.

 WORLD CUP CENTRAL: If you need World Cup soccer information, an official 
information booth opened over the weekend at South Coast Plaza in its Carousel 
Court. . . . You can get a complete schedule of games, ticket information, and 
even which local stores are selling World Cup merchandise. But don't expect to 
buy World Cup tickets there. Most of the games are already sold out, but what 
seats are left must be purchased through ticket agencies.

NEW FIGHTING IN ANGOLA INVOLVES 2 REBEL GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fighting erupted in Angola with UNITA rebels shelling northern cities and 
separatist guerrillas launching attacks in the oil enclave of Cabinda, 
government sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The state-run Jornal de Angola newspaper said separatists working with UNITA 
rebels attacked a government army barracks near the town of Belize on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 An army spokesman said UNITA killed a government soldier in an attack on 
barracks about four miles from the northwestern enclave of Cabinda on Saturday. 
No details were given. 
</P>
<P>
 No independent confirmation was immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 The low-level guerrilla struggle of the fractured Front for the Liberation of 
Cabinda Enclave is not connected with the full-scale civil war that has been 
waged for nearly 20 years by UNITA, or the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabinda is separated from the rest of Angola by Zaire's corridor to the sea. 
Liberation Front rebels have rarely attacked the mostly offshore oil 
installations that yield much of Angola's oil output. 
</P>
<P>
 State-run radio said UNITA was continuing to shell the city of N'dalatando, 
120 miles east of Luanda, the capital, which was recaptured by the government 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Angola's civil war erupted after it gained independence from Portugal in 1975. 
A brief peace following 1991 accords ended when UNITA rejected defeat in 1992 
elections.

VATICAN DOCUMENT URGES EXPANSION OF WOMEN'S ROLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After rejecting the possibility of female priests, the Vatican is seeking to 
expand and reinforce the roles of nuns and female lay workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's duties and relations with the church have been sharply debated 
recently and should be a central theme at a bishops synod in October, according 
to a draft agenda released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women . . . ought to assume all their responsibilities in society and the 
church. . . . This is the urgent challenge presented by today's culture," said 
a 127-page outline of topics expected to be discussed by bishops from around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The synod was organized to study the "consecrated life" in the church for both 
men and women. The subject of nuns and female lay religious workers touches on 
one of the most sensitive issues for the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
 The church has encouraged greater participation by women, but it steadfastly 
refuses to allow female priests. Pope John Paul II wrote last month that the 
church "has no authority" to ordain women. 
</P>
<P>
 On other levels, however, women appear to have made some advances. 
</P>
<P>
 A meeting of African bishops at the Vatican in April focused heavily on the 
strong presence of female leaders in their churches, schools and missions. The 
Vatican also has allowed women to serve Communion and has permitted girls to 
act as altar servers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see the October synod as an important statement on the innumerable -- and 
growing -- roles for lay women in the church," said Susan Muto, executive 
director of the Pittsburgh, Pa.-based Epiphany Assn., which examines concerns 
of women in the Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft for the October synod stresses the need to expand women's duties in 
the church, but it acknowledges the difficulty in getting "people to make 
fundamental and lasting commitments." 
</P>
<P>
 It particularly cites the aging and declining ranks of nuns in some Western 
nations, and it encourages bishops to do more to meet their "spiritual and 
temporal needs." It does not, however, give any specific suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 The document also notes a rise in the number of widows willing to take vows of 
chastity and allegiance to the church. It suggests that the bishops clarify the 
widows' religious work as well as their relationships with their children and 
other family members.

GUNMAN SLAIN AFTER KILLING 2, WOUNDING AT LEAST 20 AT AF BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man armed with an assault rifle opened fire at Fairchild Air Force Base 
hospital Monday, killing two people and wounding more than 20 others before 
military police shot him to death. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman, armed with an AK-47, was killed in a parking lot outside the 
hospital, said Spokane County Sheriff Larry Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman was not immediately identified, and his motive had not been 
learned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept hearing these popping noises," said Rebecka Vanover, who lives in a 
base housing area across the street from the hospital. "They sounded almost 
like firecrackers but they were dull. It was really a madhouse, all these 
sirens going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Boyle, who also lives across the street, said he heard gunshots, looked 
out his front door and saw a man dressed in black fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Five people, including a 3-year-old boy, were admitted to Deaconess Medical 
Center for treatment of gunshot wounds. Three other people were admitted to 
Sacred Heart Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 At the base, emergency vehicles were clustered along a road near the hospital, 
and several women with children gathered near the base's perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairchild Air Force Base, 10 miles west of Spokane, is a former bomber base 
that is being converted to an air refueling base.

LOCAL NOTES: DUCKS' YAKE UNDERGOES SURGERY ON SHOULDER

 Terry Yake, the Mighty Ducks' leading scorer during the team's first season, 
underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder Monday but is expected to 
recover fully before training camp opens Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Team physician Ronald Glousman performed what was described as a quick, 
uncomplicated surgery at Centinela Hospital, repairing damage resulting from a 
hit that Yake took against Edmonton April 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Yake, who also suffered a concussion in that game, missed the next two games 
but returned to the ice for the regular-season finale against Vancouver April 
13, contributing an assist for his 52nd point of the season. That assist gave 
him the team scoring title over Bob Corkum, who had 51 and led the team in 
goals with 23 despite missing the final eight games because of a ruptured 
tendon in his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Grossman, the agent for Valeri Karpov, the Ducks' 1993 third-round draft 
choice, said he and General Manager Jack Ferreira have reached agreement on a 
three-year contract (two years plus an option). Grossman said the actual 
signing was "imminent," pending resolution of minor details. Grossman declined 
to disclose financial terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Karpov -- a right wing the Ducks had hoped to sign before last season to 
provide much-needed scoring help -- had three goals and an assist for the 
Russian Olympic team at Lillehammer last winter. ROBYN NORWOOD

WRIGHT BEGINS WITH A SOLID ROUND; GOLF: FORMER BUENA HIGH STANDOUT FIRES 
FOUR-OVER-PAR 76 AT STATE AMATEUR CHAMPIONSHIP. 
</P>

 All golfer Chad Wright had to do was glance at the scoreboard tallies. The 
contrast was striking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the difference in the scores," he said aloud to nobody in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 With the field of 100 golfers split between two courses during the first round 
of the 83rd State Amateur Championship on Monday, Wright was one of only a 
handful of players who put together solid rounds at Pebble Beach Golf Links. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, a Buena High graduate who will be a sophomore at USC in the fall, shot 
a four-over-par 76. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at Spyglass Hill Golf Course, the second tournament site, Tim Hart 
of Solana Beach and Kevin Marsh of Goleta each shot 68 to share the lead, and 
1993 champion Casey Boyns of Pacific Grove shot 69. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright wasn't surprised at the scoring differential. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greens were much softer (at Spyglass)," said Wright, who played a 
practice round there over the weekend. "Once you get past the first few holes, 
the wind doesn't bother you much there." 
</P>
<P>
 The greens and chilly, 60-degree weather on Monday were more than troublesome 
for the players at seaside Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the low 27 players on the leader board, 23 played at Spyglass, including 
former champion Charlie Wi of North Hills, who shot a two-over 74 to lead all 
area players. Forty-one of 50 players at Spyglass broke 80. Only 21 of 50 at 
Pebble Beach did so. 
</P>
<P>
 The field switches sites today. The top 32 players advance to the match-play 
portion of the event, which begins Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamey Forsyth of Chatsworth shot 75, and Birmingham High graduate Yasu Amaya 
shot 78 to remain within striking range of the projected cut. Both played 
Spyglass. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime amateur standout Craig Steinberg of Van Nuys, playing at Pebble 
Beach, struggled and finished at 80, as did 17-year-old Brandon DiTullio of 
Westlake Village, the tournament's youngest player. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Tanner of Sun Valley shot 81 at Spyglass, and David Saylor of West Hills 
shot 82 at Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Wright, 18, familiarity bred success. Last year, playing in his first 
State Amateur he shot 81 at Pebble Beach and failed to make the 36-hole cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "Experience definitely helps on these greens," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright had only one costly hole on Monday. On the par-4 eighth he hit his 
second shot into a gully. He later three-putted for a triple bogey 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Wi, who will be a senior in the fall at Cal, helped stake the South team to a 
two-stroke lead in the North-South competition. Steve Woods of San Jose fired a 
three-under 69 at Spyglass as the South had a five-man total of 363.

 Treasury Bill Rates Rise: The Treasury Department sold $12.1 billion of new 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 4.18%, up from 4.16% last 
week.Another $12.1 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average 
discount rate of 4.55%, unchanged from a week ago. The three-month bill rate 
was the highest since May 31, when they sold for 4.23%. The new discount rates 
understate the actual return to investors: 4.28% for three-month bills, with a 
$10,000 bill selling for $9,894.30, and 4.72% for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,770. The discount rate reflects the price discount received when securities 
are purchased at less than face value. T-Bill Auction

<P>
 Weak foreign share prices, a tumbling U.S. dollar and worries about inflation 
and the economy combined Monday to push stock prices broadly and sharply lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller companies' stocks were once again the hardest hit, with the more 
volatile Nasdaq market dropping about 1.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 34.88 to 3,741.90; in the broader 
market, declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 2 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Board volume came to 229.52 million shares, down from 386.99 million for 
the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
 Share prices headed lower from the opening bell, with foreign stock markets 
off sharply. In Europe, investors worried about inflation, traders said, and in 
Tokyo, about the strengthening dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-share average ended 351.27 points, or 1.6%, lower at 
21,152.03. In Frankfurt, the 30-share DAX average fell 81.90 points, or 3.99%, 
to 1,968.82, to close at its lowest level since Oct. 4, 1993. In London, the 
Financial Times 100-share average fell 51.8 points, or 1.7%, to 2,971.1, and 
the Paris bourse closed down 2.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index fell 26.89 points, or 1.16%, to 2,283.61. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problems in Europe proved too much for the U.S. markets to overcome," 
said James Solloway, director of research at Argus Research Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the dollar slid to an eight-month low against the German 
mark and continued its slide against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
 That generated fears among some investors that the Federal Reserve Board will 
feel compelled to nudge interest rates higher for what would be a fifth time 
this year when its policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets in early 
July, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 A weak dollar could make imports more expensive and prompt inflation. Still, 
analysts said, further Fed action is unlikely just now because recent data 
shows the economy may be slowing. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S currency finished at 1.60 German marks in New York, down from 1.611 on 
Friday and its lowest since Oct. 12. The dollar also fell 0.90 to 101.90 
Japanese yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's fall against the mark and yen alone was enough to concern some 
investors, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Hays, investment strategist at Wheat First Butcher & Singer, described 
Monday's Wall Street action as a tug-of-war between investors worried about 
inflation and those worried about the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the widely watched Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 futures 
contracts, led by grain prices, tumbled 4.5 points to 234.87. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices for corn and soybean futures collapsed on the Chicago Board of Trade as 
forecasts for cooler, wetter Midwestern weather doused drought fears. Wheat and 
oat futures also sank. 
</P>
<P>
 That helped support the bond market, analysts said. Bond yields ended the day 
higher, pushing prices down again, in another negative for stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's main 30-year bond yield rose to 7.46% from 7.44% on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond investors don't like word of rising inflation, which erodes the value of 
fixed-income securities such as Treasuries. Stock investors don't like to see 
interest rates rise, because that increases the cost of money to corporations 
and therefore makes shares less appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other major market indicators, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks 
dropped 2.97 to 455.48, and the NYSE composite index fell 1.89 to 251.40. The 
Nasdaq composite index dropped 10.50 to 718.85. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Worry about the economy meant stocks such as autos, paper, chemicals and 
heavy machinery that are sensitive to economic cycles were among the hardest 
hit. Chrysler fell 7/8 to 47 7/8 and Caterpillar dropped 2 3/8 to 106 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Philip Morris, whose chief executive resigned unexpectedly over the weekend, 
rose 3/8 to 50 3/4 in active NYSE trading. 
</P>
<P>
 * IDB Communications fell 7/8 to 7 11/16 after a New York Times article 
disclosed details about the company's split with its auditors. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. Healthcare rose 2 1/8 to 43 1/8 amid rumors that Johnson & Johnson may 
be considering the smaller company for a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 * Coca-Cola gained 1/4 to 40 1/4 after S.G. Warburg analysts made positive 
comments about the company in a research report. 
</P>
<P>
 * Novell fell 9/16 to 15 1/16. The computer company will license its Network 
Navigator software and data distribution technology to Proginet Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 * 3Com rose 1 3/4 to 48 1/8 after reporting higher earnings late last week. 
</P>
<P>
 * Orion Pictures fell 5/16 to 2 15/16. The company said it does not expect to 
have sufficient cash flow during fiscal 1995 to make scheduled payments to some 
lenders.

FITNESS: BODY WATCH; SMART STEPS FOR BUYING WORKOUT SHOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Choosing a pair of workout shoes from this season's bumper crop can make 
buying a car seem simple. 
</P>
<P>
 The easy part -- telling the salesperson which type of shoe you need -- is 
followed by the overwhelming part: being steered to displays of basketball, 
running, aerobic, walking, tennis, cycling or cross trainer shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have almost 250 styles of athletic shoes," says Erin Kendrigan of Nike. 
Other manufacturers' tallies are also high. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading advertisements -- which seem to promise not just comfort but 
Olympic-like performance -- complicates shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's New: This season's shoes have "memory-cushion" insoles and tongue 
designs to prevent "tongue migration." For safety, there are shoes that light 
up with each step (not all use the mercury recently banned in shoes sold in 
Minnesota). More shoes are laceless, fastened instead with straps. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis on good cushioning, support and lightweight materials continues. 
"Wearing even an ounce or two lighter shoes, you feel more efficient," says Tom 
Brunick, director of the Athlete's Foot Weartest Center at North Central 
College, Naperville, Ill. "An ounce on the foot is like a pound on the hip." 
</P>
<P>
 Several companies now offer money-back guarantees. Cherokee, which makes 
Rockers walking shoes, allows shoppers to take the shoes for a 45-day walk 
test. Other manufacturers promise to replace shoes if they wear out before six 
months. Some stores allow customers to buy two different-sized shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's Selling: No-lace running shoes, non-twist tongues and lightweight 
insoles are in demand, says a salesman at a large San Fernando Valley sporting 
goods chain.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Shopping Checklist: To find the best shoes for you: 
</P>
<P>
 * Take your old athletic shoes with you. "They have a story to tell," Brunick 
says -- if, of course, your salesperson knows how to read them properly. A good 
one can tell, for instance, if your feet over-pronate (tend to roll inward) and 
might suggest a style designed to compensate. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shop at the end of the day, when feet are generally biggest. 
</P>
<P>
 * Have your feet measured from time to time, because they can lengthen and 
widen with age. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pay attention to how the shoes feel. "Comfort is the most important," says 
Michael Levi, a Santa Monica podiatrist on staff at St. John's Hospital and 
Health Center. Although the very best-fitting shoes require no breaking in, 
some shoes take a while to feel comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 * Allow a quarter-inch of room from the longest toe to the shoe's end, Levi 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you are a larger person, look for a thick mid-sole (the cushioning 
material atop the outsole, or very bottom). The extra shock absorption can 
reduce injury risk.  
</P>
<P>
 * Walk around in a shoe before you buy it, or if possible, mimic the motions 
of your workout -- jumping in basketball shoes, serving in tennis shoes. Some 
stores have set up treadmills for walkers and runners. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't scrimp. Plan to spend about $60 for good workout shoes, Levi says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Protecting Your Purchase: "Use athletic shoes only for athletics," Levi 
suggests. They'll last much longer. Once you find a brand and style, stick with 
it to minimize foot problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trade-In Time: To avoid foot problems, know when it's time for a new pair. 
"Every four to six months, or every 300 miles, whichever comes first," Levi 
says. Oh, My Aching Dogs: Sign: Possible Cause Blisters: Shoe too small 
Blackened toenails: Shoe-box area too small Corns: Shoe too narrow Feet hurt 
after two or three wearings: Wrong shoe for your foot

 The sweetest, most soothing sound I know is the music from a hammered 
dulcimer.Whenever I have time alone, I sit down at my instrument and enjoy 
making music for myself. It must be my own private time, though. I find it's 
only my solitary concerts that bring me real joy. Just one listener is allowed 
-- Rascal, my Shetland sheepdog. He seems to sense my peaceful happiness. He 
always curls up at my feet and dozes while I play.

BOOK REVIEW / PERSONAL GROWTH; LENSES AND METAPHORS THAT FOCUS ON THE MEANING 
OF LIFE; PERIPHERAL VISION: LEARNING ALONG THE WAY BY MARY CATHERINE BATESON ; 
HARPERCOLLINS $23, 243 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN SALTER REYNOLDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Is it a book about optometry?" someone asked me, looking at the cover, which 
features an eye with a psychedelic spiral coming out of it and a spirograph 
design in the background. No. It is not a book about optometry. It is about 
everything but optometry, though I feel certain that optometrists could find 
something in here to talk about.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a book of stories and reflections strung together to suggest a style 
of learning from experience," Mary Catherine Bateson writes in her gentle, 
self-effacing way. Someone with more hubris might say that it describes a way 
to suck the most out of life, to broaden one's vision and experience, to raise 
children better equipped to live in a changing world, and to not feel so bad if 
your resume looks like Scarlett O'Hara's dance card. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the ideas here are reminiscent of Bateson's last book, "Composing a 
Life," a book I am not alone in recommending to everyone who thinks that life 
should be a straight line moving in a recognizable direction. In that book, 
Bateson makes the argument, among others, that in some ways women have a better 
deal than men because traditionally they view their lives as a series of stages 
and phases, and are encouraged to do so by the physiological fact of 
child-bearing as well as the vagaries of the job market. 
</P>
<P>
 This book starts with the same idea -- that life is something we piece 
together -- but goes deeper, using several metaphors that describe the ways we 
can learn from experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The first and most central metaphor is peripheral vision: "Sometimes change is 
directly visible, but sometimes it is apparent only to peripheral vision, 
altering the meaning of the foreground." Narrowly focused attention, doing one 
thing at a time and specialization of tasks and careers (luxuries all prized in 
our society and traditionally granted mostly to men) limits our learning and 
our ability and inclination to live responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
 Another metaphor is "spiral learning": "What we call the familiar is built up 
in layers to a structure known so deeply that it is taken for granted and 
virtually impossible to observe without the help of contrast. Encountering 
familiar issues in a strange setting is like returning on a second circuit of a 
Mobius strip and coming to the experience from the opposite side." Yet another 
is the concept of Gaea, in which the earth is seen as a living organism; this 
is not Bateson's own creation, but a metaphor she uses to describe our 
dependence on and connections to the environment and other cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 Bateson has had plenty of opportunity to fine-tune her ability to learn from 
other cultures. Her parents, anthropologists Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, 
provided a rich childhood, much of it in Israel. As an adult, Bateson has lived 
in Israel, Iran and the Philippines, and "Peripheral Vision" is full of stories 
set in Persian gardens and Philippine villages, peopled with Tibetan monks and 
Quakers and students in Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough the book was written, Bateson tells us, at the MacDowell Colony, 
an isolated haven for artists and writers in New Hampshire. Her little studio 
is full of objects from her travels that prompt her memory and give a physical 
structure, like a double helix, to her ideas.  
</P>
<P>
 She has learned an enormous amount of very useful, daily-life information from 
the cultures she has lived in and studied. From an interview with a Japanese 
woman (part of a World War II study of Japanese culture): "We practice respect 
for the father . . . in case we someday find someone who deserves that 
respect." In Iran, the phrase halalet basheh, "let it be permitted to you," 
proves useful for granting an additional (if not the full amount illegally 
demanded) payment to wily cabdrivers. I fully intend to incorporate what she 
reports as the Quaker response to a difference of opinion: "Friend, it would 
never have occurred to me that way." 
</P>
<P>
 And this statement could arguably beat the Golden Rule for elegance: "Real 
help," Bateson writes, "does not treat need as the result of irresponsibility 
or malingering and is generous enough to make it possible to contribute in 
turn."  
</P>
<P>
 How can we help others, including our children, learn the most from their 
experiences? Offer "early and often the experience of difference," Bateson 
suggests, and "the experience of making and looking at art, which demonstrates 
that two people can look at the same mountain and see something different." 
</P>
<P>
 "Recognizing that the self is not identical through time," she concludes, "is 
a first step in celebrating it as fluid and variable, shaped and reshaped by 
learning."

INTO THE NIGHT: A HECK OF A HEAVY-HITTIN' HOEDOWN

 The Scene: Saturday's benefit premiere of Warner Bros.' "Wyatt Earp" at Mann's 
Chinese Theater. A party followed on the studio's Burbank lot. The film's star, 
Kevin Costner, said of the Western: "This movie is a meal." He wasn't kidding. 
At three hours plus, it was a seven-course movie. 
</P>
<P>
 The Setting: The party, held on the studio's two-by-four-block Western set, 
featured Western bands, trick ropers, quick-draw shooters, 12 buffets and 
provocatively costumed saloon girls, who prompted one woman to comment: "Hey, 
it's like Heidi Fleiss comes to Tombstone." 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: The film's stars -- Costner, Gene Hackman and Dennis Quaid (who 
said, "You don't want to know," when asked how he lost 43 pounds to play 
consumptive dentist-gunfighter Doc Holliday); director Lawrence Kasdan; 
co-producer Jim Wilson; plus 2,000 guests, including Martin Short, James Earl 
Jones, Rita Wilson, Tony Bill, Jackie Collins, Mike Medavoy, Al Ruddy, Mark and 
Lezlie Johnson, and Warner execs Bob Daly, Terry Semel, Bruce Berman and Rob 
Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
 Topic of Conversation: Could anything compete with the O.J. Simpson saga? A 
Disney exec said the car chase was shown live on two channels in Milan, Italy. 
One producer said watching the Bronco on the freeway reminded him of "Speed." 
"I kept thinking it was wired so it couldn't go over 40 miles an hour." 
</P>
<P>
 Legends Don't Always Make Big First Impressions: Asked if he met Wyatt Earp 
(who consulted on silent films and died in Los Angeles in 1929) 86-year-old 
Gene Autry said, "I think I did, yes." Asked what Earp was like, Autry said: "I 
can't remember too much about him." 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "This is a bigger movie than I think people have seen in a long time," 
said Kasdan, who wrote, produced and directed. "This is an old-fashioned epic, 
like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Doctor Zhivago.' It takes you all the way from 
the end of the Civil War to the turn of the century with one of the most 
interesting guys who ever lived." 
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: The $450,000 raised was divided between two charities: Tripod, 
which aids deaf and hearing-impaired children, and Futures for Children, a 
provider of educational programs for Native American youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Takes on Stardom: At the same moment Costner was being interviewed by a TV 
entertainment program whose pot-bellied, middle-aged soundman was so 
magnificently bored he was reading Readers Digest while taping the star's 
conversation, the teen-age girl selling tickets for Starline Tours jumped 
through her booth's window, wild-eyed, auto-focus camera in hand, and came 
running over to get closer to the actor. In a way, both seemed satisfied by 
their brush with a star.

THEATER REVIEW; ENOUGH LOVE TO GO AROUND; THE PURSUIT IN 'TRIUMPH' OFFERS MORE 
THAN SENTIMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The titles of Pierre Marivaux's plays -- "Harlequin Polished by Love," "The 
Surprise of Love" and "The Game of Love and Chance" -- reveal this 
early-18th-Century playwright's obsession and calling. If he was concerned with 
social justice and the importance of character over class (anticipating 
Rousseau by 20 years), those themes also fed his favorite subject, for what is 
love without generosity and a clear-eyed perception of a person's true 
qualities? 
</P>
<P>
 "The Triumph of Love," now at the La Jolla Playhouse's Mandell Weiss Forum, is 
considered one of Marivaux's most complex heroic comedies, and director Lisa 
Peterson emphasizes the heroic by giving us, in Angie Phillips, a Phocion who 
is dashingly confident and thoroughly winning even in her most callous moments. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot, which Marivaux dispenses quickly and early, is this: The princess 
Leonide has fallen in love from afar with Agis, so she invades the sanctum of 
his adopted father, philosopher Hermocrate (Tony Amendola), and his sister of a 
certain age, Leontine (Beth Dixon). Dressed as a man, Phocion, she seduces 
Hermocrate as a young woman who is disguised as Phocion only to be near him and 
study his wisdom. As Phocion, she seduces the philosopher's sister, as well. Of 
course she must also seduce Agis and still find time to bribe two servants, 
Harlequin (the rubber-faced Paul Giamatti) and a dimwitted gardener named Dimas 
(Silas Weir Mitchell) with a little help from her maid Corine (Laurie 
Williams), disguised as a page called Hermidas. 
</P>
<P>
 If that sounds convoluted, it doesn't feel that way in this breathless and 
delightful staging, which, like the loving production of "Harvey" currently at 
La Jolla's Mandell Weiss Theatre, mines the play for all of its humor and then 
imaginatively adds more of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Marivaux examines love without mawkishness. Setting his plays in a world where 
a servant's loyalty to his master can always be purchased with a bag of gold, 
Marivaux never shies from depicting the shocking selfishness of the lover 
hungry to capture his prey. 
</P>
<P>
 Angie Phillips has a triumph in the role. Seemingly effortlessly, Phillips 
captures the musicality of Marivaux's language and even carries out Phocion's 
vow to "act without scruples" with royal confidence and an intelligence that 
far outstrips the object of her affection (watching Agis cerebrate, she 
remarks, "How long you've been at the solution!"). Her Phocion is charming 
because he/she is too utterly engaged in the great challenge of language, lying 
and seduction to have time to consider his/her own charms. 
</P>
<P>
 While there's humor in seeing Phocion's charm undo both virtue and philosophy, 
Dixon holds onto the spinster Leontine's humanity, and Amendola gets at the 
philosopher's distress in acknowledging the irrefutable force of attraction. 
The entire cast brings something original to roles that were, after all, 
written largely for the stock characters of the Theatre Italien, a Paris-based 
rival to the Comedie Francaise. As the story's clowns, Paul Giamatti and Silas 
Weir Mitchell keep the jokes flowing, even invoking the Three Stooges and, 
fleetingly, Jackie Gleason, in their quest for low comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina Draghici's set suggests the 18th-Century salon with a crystal 
chandelier, off-center and unexpected, like much of the production's humor. A 
long shelf of impressive-looking books is replaced in the second act by a 
sumptuous table, overflowing with candles, cupids, flowers and fruits, 
signaling that all members of the studious household have been transformed by 
the pleasure of love. Likewise, in the garden, large pots of dead-looking dirt 
are changed, under Tim Becker's lighting, to a rich brown-blue in the second 
act, revealing the mineral life that had been lurking there before. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Taggart's costumes are a witty amalgam of 18th-Century cliches, 
culminating in an orange fairy-tale princess dress for Leonide's debut as a 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his clearheadedness, Marivaux believed that love betters everything. 
After Hermocrate and Leontine have fallen, they dress and powder themselves 
like the unhinged, but are at least lunatics who feel joy. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the joy worth it, when one is deceived and abandoned by a lover, albeit a 
royal one? This production addresses that question by ending on a melancholy 
note. But the image at the play's start is truer to its heart. A man in 
friar-like robes runs his finger lovingly over some volumes of books, 
searching. He spots an open book on the floor, bathed in light, and kneels down 
to its pages, finding in them the object of his search, a rapturous emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Marivaux might be obsessed with love, but he is no mere sentimentalist. He 
explores his subject through ideas, not platitudes. And the triumph of this 
"Triumph of Love" is that we still feel the presence of the bookshelf even 
after it has been banished from the stage. Theatergoers can feast on low comedy 
at La Jolla and still be connected to high ideas and high culture. 
</P>

DANCE REVIEW; AROUND THE WORLD WITH DEAN, AMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirty years ago, the founders of the Aman Folk Ensemble created a company 
with a uniquely American vision -- to present not just the cultural traditions 
of a single nation or region, but to offer a world-dance panorama on every 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept seemed adventuresome to some observers, superficial to others, but 
it survived and even flourished right here in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In celebration of that achievement, the company commissioned for its 30th 
anniversary a work that is a world-dance panorama in itself: Laura Dean's 
spectacular "Light," in which folkloric materials from all over are sampled and 
reassembled according to the priorities of postmodern structuralism. 
</P>
<P>
 That may sound shocking to purists, but the local premiere of "Light" at the 
Alex Theatre on Sunday proved that Dean is simply doing in one, 20-minute work 
what Aman has done in its repertory for three decades: take music and dance 
from many cultures out of their original contexts and boil them down into 
showpiece entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference, of course, between "Light" and Deanne Sparks' new hard-sell 
Tahitian suite for the company is that Dean spares us the illusion of a 
specific exotic society. Instead, she shows us the contemporary world we know: 
people moving between traditions, genuinely (if glibly) multicultural, a world 
in which heritages clash and form something new. 
</P>
<P>
 Using two dozen skillful dancers and musicians, Dean creates an articulate 
style from a compendium of sources. In their propulsive score, she and her 
co-composer John Zeretzke combine Native American and West African drums with 
instruments from Ireland and North Africa and add a layer of fiddles for 
sweetness. The result is a distillation with a glowing life of its own, a kind 
of anthropological dream both strange and familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the movement may highlight a Central Asian arm motif or an Eastern 
European line-step or a shoulder-shake that could belong to several traditions 
-- but Dean's characteristic fixation on repetition and formal patterning keep 
the specifics subordinate to a grand architectural design. 
</P>
<P>
 Unison drive is unrelenting and irresistible here, and though Dean varies it 
through counterpoint and softens it in passages of spinning, she ultimately 
projects it right in the audience's teeth -- just like all the Aman suites 
constructed for maximum punch. Consider it Aman in miniature -- everything you 
need to know about this company in 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, almost everything: The mellow vocalism of the Nevenka women in two 
segments on Sunday reminded everyone of how the success of Aman has brought 
other ensembles into being -- some with deeper, less aggressive approaches to 
folklore. Moreover, the magnificent red and white costumes used for Barry 
Glass' new sumptuous, large-scale Posavina (central Croatia) suite at the 
beginning of the program supplied proof of the fabled material riches in the 
Aman archives. 
</P>
<P>
 But questions remain, even after 30 years. With the house lights off and no 
narration, for instance, how do you know exactly what you're watching -- or 
isn't that important in a world-dance panorama? Why do people who normally 
dance for one another in their native villages always get Amanized into 
professional chorus lines dancing for outsiders (the audience)? 
</P>
<P>
 Aman has just cause to take pride in the success of its 30th-anniversary 
program and its many accomplishments over the years. Not the least of them is 
offering a major contemporary choreographer a bold opportunity for growth. But 
anniversaries are a good occasion for reality checks -- and this company really 
needs to look at its repertory with an eye to how much has been lost in the 
relentless pursuit of easy applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Aman was originally scheduled to dance this program in Royce Hall, but the 
Northridge earthquake led UCLA to move the company to the Wadsworth Theater. 
However, when its stage proved too small for "Light," the company chose the 
Alex in Glendale: a theater with a low stage and disastrous sight-lines for 
dance if you're seated in the front half of the orchestra. The ticket and 
will-call lines were also a nightmare on Sunday, but that problem, at least, 
can be more easily fixed.

JAZZ REVIEW; FOUNTAIN, ADE AND SANBORN ADD ECLECTICISM TO PLAYBOY FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, let's be honest about this. The hit acts of the Sunday session of the 
Playboy Jazz Festival were Pete Fountain, King Sunny Ade and David Sanborn. 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly the politically correct jazz choices, but there's no denying the 
fact that Fountain's recycled Dixieland, Ade's African pop and Sanborn's 
contemporary funk captivated the audience far more than the mainstream jazz of 
Elvin Jones, Joe Williams and the Count Basie Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 But let's look at the upside. Fountain, Ade and Sanborn represent three 
strikingly different aspects of the jazz experience, and, if nothing else, 
their presence on the program illustrated the colorful eclecticism of the 
contemporary jazz scene. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Fountain's jaunt through a collection of Dixieland chestnuts had 
less to do with the enduring creative value of the style than it did with its 
commercial appeal, but the performance of his seven-piece band was bright and 
spirited -- a real door-opener for neophyte jazz fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Ade's music also has its commercial qualities, but his percussion-heavy group 
performed their propulsive rhythms, call-and-response vocals and infectious 
melodies in a fashion that clearly underlined the primal connections between 
African music and the roots of jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sanborn did what he does best -- spin out a series of riff-based solos 
over hypnotically repetitive funk rhythms. Musically limited? You bet, but 
perfectly in tune with an audience eager to respond to some easy R&B-styled 
dance rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of the mainstream groups fared quite as well. In the case of the Basie 
band, which was led by Frank Foster, the problem of audience interaction was 
compounded by that old bugaboo -- lousy audio. The utter mystification that 
seems to possess the Playboy Festival audio engineers (who are not the regular 
Bowl audio crew) when they must deal with a big band once again took over, and 
both the subtle sounds of the Basie rhythm section and the power chords of the 
brass were sacrificed to a sound mix more appropriate for a rock group. Too 
bad, because the band played with fine-spirited enthusiasm, while backing Joe 
Williams, as well as while roaring through such classics as "Whirly Bird" and 
"April in Paris." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' solo set, performed with a smaller rhythm section, provided several 
of the day's authentic jazz moments. Arguably one of the best singers in the 
world, the 75-year-old Williams balanced shouting blues numbers with spare, 
remarkably subtle (given the venue) readings of tunes such as "Tenderly." His 
brief exchange of riffs with drummer Paul Humphrey was one of the festival's 
finest small musical gems. 
</P>
<P>
 Elvin Jones, another jazz veteran, showcased a group that sputtered and 
stammered for the first half of its program. Heavily reliant upon the surging 
musical energy of trombonist Delfeayo Marsalis, the ensemble finally came to 
life when Jones exploded with a trademark drum solo blazing with the 
multilayered rhythms for which he is justifiably famous. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist Russell Malone's opening performance was less effective, wasting too 
much time on an overcooked simulation of B. B. King, and not enough on his own 
impressive, straight-ahead improvisations. Marcus Roberts' piano trio was 
similarly unfocused -- a blend of standards and originals in which the leader's 
rapid-finger technique too often became the center of attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Tito Puente, relegated to the audience-departing closing spot on the bill, 
nonetheless generated some of the event's most riveting jazz, powerfully 
vitalized by a guest lineup that included flutist Dave Valentin, pianist Hilton 
Ruiz, trumpeter Charlie Sepulveda and congalero Mongo Santamaria. It was a 
splendid climax for a festival whose only real failure -- again -- was its 
continuing reluctance to honor the role of women in jazz.

SCREENING ROOM; 'NAKED MAN' LOOKS AT THE ROLE OF THE ARTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Films of Konrad Wolf," one of the year's most rewarding retrospectives, 
continues today at the Goethe Institute, 5700 Wilshire Blvd., with "The Naked 
Man on the Playing Field" (1974), which on a less epic scale than Wolf's "Goya" 
explores the role of the artist in society and also makes a plea for the 
artist's freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
 The film, written by Wolfgang Kohlhasse, takes a droll, indirect approach to 
these questions and emphatically presents its hero, sculptor Kemmel (Kurt 
Bowe), as a burly, middle-aged, hard-working laborer rather than as an exotic 
type somehow elevated above the common man.Of course, Kemmel is not at all 
ordinary, and the film treats with wry humor his struggles to get his sometimes 
controversial work placed where he intended it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolf series concludes Thursday at 7 p.m. with "Solo Sunny" (1980), which 
brought its pretty, irresistibly impish star, Renate Krossner, the best actress 
award at the Berlin Film Festival for her portrayal of a scrappy aspiring pop 
singer of limited ability and a complicated love life. 
</P>
<P>
 The determined Sunny endures repeated assaults on her dignity as a member of 
an impoverished small touring revue in her struggle to escape her drab 
existence as a factory worker. "Sunny," also written by Kohlhasse, is an 
affectionate, poignant portrait of a survivor, a woman who insists on living 
her life on her own terms.

TV REVIEWS; 'TROUBLE WITH EVAN': FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Television, which brought us the seminal "An American Family," offers another 
painfully explicit view inside a torn family tonight in "The Trouble With 
Evan," about a violent 11-year-old boy and the family atmosphere that bred him. 
</P>
<P>
 In this 90-minute "Frontline"-Canadian Broadcasting Corp. co-production by 
Neil Docherty, Evan first appears to be a wild child with no moral compass.His 
pyromania alone is nearly out of control, with Mike claiming that the boy 
almost started a forest fire. When he isn't attacking other schoolkids, he is 
stealing money, pulling dangerous pranks and seemingly on course for teen-age 
delinquency and worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Docherty subtly constructs a surprising narrative, which gradually reveals 
that the trouble with Evan is the trouble with Evan's family. There's a novel's 
worth of complications here, but fundamentally, Evan feels neglected by Mike, 
who admits that he has devoted little time to the boy, his stepson. Evan 
appears to be like a plant that hasn't been watered, a striking reminder of why 
boys need a father perhaps even more than they need a mother. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Trouble With Evan" airs at 9 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV 
Channel 15, and at 8 on KVCR-TV Channel 24. ROBERT KOEHLER

TV REVIEWS; 'XXX'S AND OOO'S' PURE COUNTRY CORN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a whole lotta lovin', leavin', lamentin' and line-dancin' in the TV 
movie "XXX's and OOO's," set in Nashville amid the realm of new country's new 
hunks. The romantic drama actually centers on a quartet of strong-willed 
Tennessee gals, three of whom are the hunks' ex-wives, hence the title pun. 
</P>
<P>
 Directed by Allan Arkush, who deserves better, this telefilm is clearly 
intended less as a one-shot than as a pilot, with aspirations toward setting up 
a regular nighttime soap -- a "Grand Ole Melrose," or "Belle Meade 90210," if 
you will. 
</P>
<P>
 This could make for good camp, and occasionally someone gets off a line that 
at least sounds like a halfway decent simile from a mediocre country weeper. 
But mostly everyone acts and speaks in such earnest and generic -- albeit 
accented -- tones that the setting might as well be Anytown U.S.A. 
</P>

 Linda Schaffer's "Homeward Bound," another absorbing one-hour American Movie 
Classics documentary on the movies, uses home movies, newsreels and archival 
footage as well as Hollywood films to reveal how American family life has 
changed since the advent of sound. It doesn't tell us much that we don't 
already know but it has the virtue of calling attention to filmmakers who have 
tried to reflect real life and deal with human values. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman Lear, Paul Mazursky and Robert Benton, all of whom have dealt with 
family life -- Lear on TV -- are all old enough to have experienced the Great 
Depression as children, and they all attest to family solidarity in the face of 
substantial financial adversity, as exemplified on the screen in "The Grapes of 
Wrath." 
</P>
<P>
 While TV in the '50s was idealizing the family, much in the manner of the 
earlier Andy Hardy pictures, the big screen was commencing to depict the 
disintegration of the family, most notably in the James Dean films "Rebel 
Without a Cause" and "East of Eden." 
</P>
<P>
 More recent decades have been marked by films dealing with divorce and single 
parenting; even so, this pleasant special ends on an optimistic note, 
reaffirming the revival of the family -- but in new configurations.

SACRAMENTO FILE: RESOLUTION WOULD MAKE JUDGES LEARN ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jerry Gillam, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spurred by the O.J. Simpson case, the Assembly has approved a resolution 
requiring judges to learn more about the importance of domestic violence cases. 
</P>
<P>
 A 42-8 vote sent the resolution (ACR 1) by Assemblyman Bob Epple (D-Cerritos), 
the chairman of the Public Safety Committee, to the Senate for further 
screening. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges would have to attend a one-day domestic violence training session every 
year under the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Epple said Simpson was given a light sentence by a judge in a 1989 domestic 
violence case involving his now-slain ex-wife that included a $200 fine, 
psychiatric counseling conducted over the telephone and community service work 
that was not completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution had asked for Simpson to receive 30 days in county jail, three 
years probation, a fine, one year of participation in a batterers' program, and 
to give money to a shelter for battered mates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge was not familiar with domestic violence," the assemblyman told his 
colleagues. "He felt it was a family matter." GOVERNOR 
</P>
<P>
 * Signed into law a bill (SB 1533) by Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-Modesto) to 
require poultry advertised and sold as "fresh" by markets to be just that and

<P>
 Floor Action 
</P>
<P>
 * Unmarried Couples: Reversed itself and sent to the Assembly on a 21-16 vote 
a bill (SB 2061) by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) allowing extension of 
health care benefits to registered gay and other unmarried couples employed by 
local governmental agencies that have contracts with the state retirement 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 * Volunteer School Police: Passed and sent to the governor on a 35-0 vote a 
bill (SB 281) by Sen. Ruben S. Ayala (D-Chino) to authorize local school boards 
to establish unpaid volunteer police reserve corps to supplement salaried 
school police forces. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tobacco Products: Rejected on a 20-16 vote a bill (SB 1271) by Hart to 
eliminate a multimillion-dollar tax provision that lets tobacco companies write 
off product advertising and promotional expenses.

</P>
<P>
 * Absentee Voters: The Elections Committee approved a bill (AB 2446) by 
Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) to allow registered voters to 
apply for permanent absentee voter status. A 5-2 vote sent the bill to the 
Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 * Legislative Stand-Ins: The Elections Committee rejected a constitutional 
amendment (SCA 40) by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) to let state 
legislative candidates select an alternate to run with them and replace them in 
case of a vacancy. No motion was made to move the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 * Parental Liability: The Judiciary Committee approved a bill (AB 308) by 
Assemblyman Dean Andal (R-Stockton) to increase from $10,000 to $25,000 the 
amount for which a parent is liable for the malicious destruction of property 
by a child. An 8-1 vote sent the bill to the Appropriations Committee.

PILOT DIES AS HIS ULTRA-LIGHT PLANE STALLS AND CRASHES; ACCIDENT: FRANK PERRY 
JR., 72, OF CAMARILLO, TOOK OFF ALONE FROM SANTA PAULA AIRPORT. FAA FINDS NO 
MECHANICAL CAUSE FOR THE TRAGEDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An ultra-light experimental plane that had been flown only once before crashed 
shortly after takeoff from Santa Paula Airport Monday morning, killing the 
pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Ernest Perry Jr., 72, of Camarillo, was the only one aboard when his 
homemade aircraft stalled at between 150 and 200 feet and plunged into the 
Santa Clara River's south bank, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Aviation Administration investigators found no apparent cause of the 
accident. No engine failure occurred, and nothing was structurally wrong with 
the aircraft, FAA Inspector Tom Mangum said. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy determined that Perry died of multiple head injuries and ruled out 
the possibility of a stroke or heart attack before the crash, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry lifted off from the airport's runway at 9:07 a.m. without trouble, 
witnesses said. He flew west and was turning south when the nose dipped, 
causing the plane to spiral downward, Mangum said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loved to fly," said his wife, Evelyn, who rushed to the airport after a 
friend called her. "That airplane was his baby." 
</P>
<P>
 The retired Thousand Oaks High School shop teacher built the plane without 
using a kit. It was a replica of a 1924 craft called the Dormoy Flying Bathtub. 
The name came from the fuselage, which resembled a bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends said Perry had flown the tiny plane about a year ago but wanted to 
make changes to it, including installing a new propeller. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry had built and flown at least two other small airplanes before he began 
constructing the Dormoy replica, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew what he was doing," said Lee Landis, a pilot who knew Perry for about 
20 years. "He wasn't an amateur. He's not a daredevil pilot." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perry's license was last updated in May, 1988, and was expired at the time of 
the accident, FAA officials said. But under FAA regulations, a pilot's license 
is not needed to fly ultra-light aircraft, spokesman Hank Verbais said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are the planes regulated by the FAA as long as they stay within certain 
weight and speed restrictions, Verbais said. 
</P>
<P>
 Accident statistics for ultra-light aircraft were not available Monday, 
officials said. Earl Lawrence, a spokesman for the Experimental Aircraft Assn., 
said the aircraft industry has not begun to compile any significant data to 
indicate whether ultra-light airplanes are more or less dangerous than other 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, another Camarillo man was killed when his ultra-light plane 
went down in a strawberry field while he was practicing forced stalls at 
Camarillo Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The sport of building and flying ultra-light planes began in the 1970s. Such 
planes have been described as hang gliders with motors attached. Lawrence said 
interest in ultra-light planes has been growing, and most are put together by 
people using kits. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid FAA regulation, ultra-lights must be used strictly for recreation. 
They must weigh less than 254 pounds, have a maximum fuel-tank capacity of five 
gallons, and cannot fly faster than about 60 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Some investigators were shocked at the tiny size of Perry's plane when they 
arrived at the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
 "God, he flew in this thing?" said Ventura County Deputy Coroner Dale Zentzis, 
who added that he has seen several ultra-light crash scenes in his career. 
"This is probably more frail than most." 
</P>
<P>
 The steel frame was mangled in the crash and the wings badly torn. Two bicycle 
wheels that were used for landing were bent, and the propeller was smashed. 
Officials had to wade across the river from the airport to get to the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's accident was the fifth fatal crash in three years at or near Santa 
Paula Airport, which is a private airfield built by local ranchers in 1930. A 
total of seven people have died in the crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Friends say Perry and his wife, who is also a pilot, had not flown much in 
recent years, but he was a well-known figure at the airport because he 
faithfully visited his hangar daily to work on the Dormoy replica. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so wrapped up in his airplane," said Harrison Bemis, owner of an 
airplane repair shop at the airport. "He built it from scratch." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry worked as a industrial arts teacher at Thousand Oaks High School for 
many years and retired in 1984, officials said. After his retirement, he spent 
even more time working on his planes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always here at the crack of dawn for coffee," a waitress at the airport 
restaurant said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends say Perry had fallen in love with aviation when he was trained during 
World War II as a flying gunner. His wife said she has been a pilot for about 
20 years, and their two sons also enjoy flying. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Johnson, who knew Perry for about 20 years, said he was shocked to hear of 
the accident because Perry is careful with his workmanship. Two of his sons 
took shop classes from Perry, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because a plane is experimental doesn't mean it's dangerous," Johnson 
said. "The Wright brothers had an experimental plane. But I guess it's a risk 
you take every time you go up there."

CIGARETTE CAUSED HOUSE BLAZE, SAY INVESTIGATORS; OAK VIEW: FIRE AND POLICE 
OFFICIALS SAY THEY FOUND NO SIGN OF ARSON AT HOME OF BLACK FAMILY, WHO STILL 
BELIEVE IT WAS A RACIAL ATTACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A smoldering cigarette, not a firebomb, started the blaze that burned a black 
family out of their Oak View home two weeks ago, Ventura County investigators 
concluded Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 After an intensive probe that involved a trained dog sniffing for fuel, 
firefighters sifting through ashes and researchers analyzing shards of window 
glass, fire and police officials say they found no evidence of arson. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members say they still believe the fire was a race-provoked hate crime 
started by an incendiary device thrown through their front window. 
</P>
<P>
 But a joint team of firefighters and police said they could not support that 
theory. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing to indicate that it was flammable liquid" causing the fire, 
said Sandi Wells, spokeswoman for the Ventura County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, the pattern of the flames suggested a cigarette that began burning out 
of control, Wells said. The June 7 fire caused $150,000 in damage and left 
13-year-old Shuwana Stanford with first- and second-degree burns on her face. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stanford family, now living temporarily in a dormitory at a private school 
in Ojai, did not accept the investigators' conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can say what they want," Winnie Stanford, Shuwana's grandmother, said 
Monday. "All I know is she doesn't smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford said she was disappointed with the results of the investigation but 
pleasantly surprised by the community's response to their crisis. Residents 
from Ojai Valley and across the county have filled local fire stations with 
clothes, kitchen supplies and money for the family. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, firefighters have now called off the clothing drive because the 
family has no space to store any more goods. "I think the whole town has been 
great," Winnie Stanford said. "Everyone has been really good to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Six months before the fire, Shuwana had withdrawn from Matilija Junior High 
School after being the object of racial taunts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten people were sleeping in the three-bedroom home on Grande Vista when the 
fire broke out at 3:48 a.m. Family members said they heard a popping sound, 
followed by a single stream of fire. They also described seeing a hole in the 
living room window. The fire left three family members with minor injuries and 
left the Stanfords with the uneasy feeling that they were targets of a racial 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time investigators arrived, the fire had blown out the window glass, 
leaving no evidence of a hole. They sent pieces of glass to a laboratory to 
test whether it was broken forcibly, one firefighter said. Investigators also 
sifted through the ashy remains of the house, looking for a device that could 
have been attached to a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 They also brought in Buddy, a Labrador retriever trained to sniff out the 
scent of flammable liquids at fire scenes. "Buddy did not find any indication 
of flammable liquid," Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators then lifted up the living room carpet, looking for the pattern 
of the fire. A flammable liquid fire tends to leave marks and residue on the 
floor, said one firefighter, who asked not to be named. But investigators found 
none of the telltale signs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the pattern resembled a cigarette fire, which builds intensely in one 
spot and then spreads quickly across a room, authorities said. The fire would 
likely have destroyed any remains of cigarette butts, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigative team, including firefighters and the Sheriff's Department 
Major Crimes Unit, was expected to release a full report possibly as early as 
this week.

U.S. OFFICIALS SAY HILLTOP WEATHER TOWER WILL STAY; OJAI: THEY FIELD QUESTIONS 
ON THE FACILITY AT SEN. BOXER'S REQUEST, BUT ANGRY RESIDENTS GET NO 
SATISFACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Federal officials have ruled out moving a radiation-emitting weather tower 
from its mountaintop perch near Ojai, despite complaints from hundreds of 
residents worried about long-term health effects who gathered Monday night at a 
town-hall meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Commerce Secretary David J. Barram, who visited the 98-foot radar 
antenna Monday afternoon, said the government has no plans to relocate the 
weather-tracking station to an area less populated than the Sulphur Mountain 
neighborhood outside Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not what we're here to do," Barram said at a news conference called 
hours before Monday's meeting at Matilija Junior High School. "We don't have 
any plans to move it." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Barram came to Ventura County only at the request of Democratic U.S. 
Sen. Barbara Boxer to answer residents' questions about the tower. Boxer 
visited the site earlier this year and promised to work to relocate the weather 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Commerce oversees the National Weather Service, which 
is building more than 160 of the radar towers across the country as part of its 
decade-long upgrading of national weather-tracking equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Barram said Monday, however, that it never has been the government's intention 
to move the tower, as Ojai area residents have requested. The system is "10 
times safer than a microwave oven" and emits 10,000 times less radiation than 
federal safety regulations allow, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of analysis is done to find the right place," Barram said at the news 
conference. "Most people around the country are pretty pleased" with the 
performance of the NEXRAD or next-generation radar towers. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents attending the Monday night meeting were less than pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents complained that the low-level radiation emitted by the tower 
may eventually cause cancer, birth defects or other illnesses after years of 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday's meeting, organized by Citizens Against Radiation Exposure, the 
walls of the school auditorium were decorated with dozens of posters, flyers 
and children's drawings opposing the tower. Opponents sold "Move the Tower" 
T-shirts and caps outside, while inside residents presented videos and gave 
speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to fight until it's gone because I'm not going to raise my daughter 
with radiation shooting her daily," said Dwier Brown, an actor who lives in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's wife, Kim Maxwell-Brown, cited what she said were past examples of 
risks to the public that the government deemed acceptable, including nuclear 
testing in the Nevada desert in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where will you be in 20 years?" she asked Barram, clutching her 13-month-old, 
Lily. "I'll be here possibly dealing with a child that has cancer or leukemia. 
This time, why not do something before it's too late?" 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the tower, who have mobilized much of the Ojai community against 
the weather station since it was erected late last year, went through an 
hours-long presentation at Matilija Junior High School designed to convince 
Barram that it should be moved. 
</P>
<P>
 Some tower opponents spoke about new information from U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency officials, who said last month that not enough tests have 
been done on the system to conclude that it is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Others complained Monday that the weather service built the system over a 
holiday weekend without telling neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of their own documents state that they will obtain conditional-use 
permits and notify the residents" before building the radar tower, said Dale G. 
Givner, an Oxnard attorney who lives in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't do any of that," said Givner, who lost a federal suit brought by 
residents against the government earlier this year. "All they've done is lie 
and cheat to obtain their goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Givner said he plans to appeal the decision by the end of July. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer is not the only official in Washington to object to the tower. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) appeared on national television earlier 
this year arguing that the National Weather Service failed to guarantee that 
the system is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to a specific request by Gallegly, the EPA said it could not 
sanction the radar system. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current knowledge of biological and health effects . . . does not allow 
us to make a definitive statement" about its safety to the public, the EPA 
wrote Gallegly on May 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Barram's announcement Monday that he would not approve moving the 
tower, opponents remain convinced that the fight is not over. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to move," said David Hedman, one of two co-plaintiffs in the 
unsuccessful federal lawsuit. "If it takes us a year or five years, it's just a 
matter of time."

OXNARD EXPECTED TO REBUILD OLD BOXING CLUB IN LA COLONIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is marred by weeds, graffiti and broken bottles, the tiny abandoned 
firehouse in Oxnard that once housed La Colonia Boxing Club. 
</P>
<P>
 But the stucco building, and the 30 years of local boxing tradition it 
represents, have not been forgotten by the neighborhood's youth and community 
leaders -- or, it now appears, by Oxnard's City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council today is set to approve a $250,000 program to enlarge as well 
as renovate the old boxing club, located at 520 E. 1st St., in the heart of La 
Colonia. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebuilding plan comes as a pleasant surprise to the barrio's youngsters, 
many of whom trained and hung out in the boxing club before it was shut down by 
city officials in 1990 due to concerns about its structural safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of people will take advantage of it," said Juan Diaz, 16, who 
lives a block from the club and trained there as a child. "It showcases your 
skills, it lets you be aggressive, and it gets you out of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of the La Colonia Youth Boxing Assn., a local booster 
organization, club members were able to move to a small room inside the Oxnard 
Boys & Girls Club after the city closed the old building. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But because of limited space, only the most dedicated young boxers followed, 
leading many youths back out into some of Oxnard's meanest streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a cousin that boxes and he had to go to someone's garage to train," 
said Ralph Lopez, 27, a basketball coach at the Colonia Recreation Center. 
"There's a lot of good boxers coming out of here, and they all need a place to 
box." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, several talented boxers have come out of the La Colonia Boxing Club, 
most notably Robert Garcia, an undefeated professional featherweight (11-0) who 
made it to the semifinals for the recent Olympics, and Fernando Vargas, the 
current U.S. amateur lightweight champion. The boxing club is widely regarded 
as one of the finest amateur programs in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a culture in which boxers are viewed as macho icons, La Colonia's 
youngsters also know that hard work in the ring will bring them legitimacy and 
respect, Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can easily get into a fight out here," he said, pointing to the street, 
"and they might be tough in the street world. But the ring is the true test of 
a fighter and they know it. In order to be a good fighter in the ring, you have 
to be more than tough. You have to have your heart in it." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had sought federal money to renovate the boxing club since it 
was closed, finally obtaining $182,000 in Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery 
funds and a $78,000 Community Development Block Grant in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It has taken until now for the city to find a bidder to perform the work, 
which includes renovating the existing 1,700-square-foot area and adding 1,300 
square feet and a mezzanine. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members today will also discuss using $52,000 in block grant 
funds allotted to the Police Athletic League for the boxing club, which will be 
run in part by PAL and the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been discussing this a long time, and I think there's a need in the 
Colonia area for something like this," said Mayor Manuel Lopez, a 
self-professed boxing enthusiast. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of people that have been involved in the boxing programs in the 
past, and I think this will show that we are interested in maintaining the 
boxing tradition in this city."

TROUBLED STUDENTS WOULD GET INTENSIVE ATTENTION AT PROPOSED CONTINUATION SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Thousand Oaks teen-agers who fall behind in credits, frequently skip class or 
misbehave on campus may soon have a new option for putting their academic 
record back in order. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a proposal that Conejo Valley school officials will consider this week, 
troubled students would be able to make up failed or missed credits through an 
intensive mini-high school on the campus of Newbury Park High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The program would serve about 25 students at a time and feature counseling and 
unusually low pupil-teacher ratios. The goal is to have students rejoin their 
peers in traditional classrooms and graduate with them. 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, the plan would create a second continuation school in the Conejo 
Valley Unified School District. But unlike the existing continuation school, 
which serves about 250 students, the smaller program would be housed within the 
Newbury Park High campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's for someone who's not, for whatever reason, able to accomplish what they 
need to in a (traditional) setting," said Jody Dunlap, principal of the 
district's current continuation school, known as Conejo Valley High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Although administrators hope to have the program running by fall, it must 
first win approval from state and local officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees with the Conejo Valley district are expected to vote on the plan 
during Thursday's board meeting. An application to create a "necessary small 
high school" would then be sent to the state Department of Education, where the 
review process could take several months. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two school board members said Monday that they support the plan because state 
funds, rather than district money, would be used to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes sense economically and financially because they get higher staffing 
levels than the rest of the system," Trustee Bill Henry said. "It's kind of 
foolish not to take advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Under state guidelines, the mini-school's staff would include several 
full-time teaching positions in addition to a full-time counselor. The program 
could serve up to 40 students, but district officials said they would limit it 
to no more than 28 and possibly as few as 23. 
</P>
<P>
 That would mean one teacher or counselor for every six or seven students, 
giving teachers time to work one-on-one with students or to call the home if a 
student fails to show up. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, the district's three traditional high schools have 
student-teacher ratios of 30 to 1. Each high school counselor serves about 600 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap said she believes the lower ratios could prove to be a formula for 
success. About 90% of the continuation students referred to Conejo Valley High 
School are sent there for academic rather than disciplinary reasons, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the state willing to pay for such programs, Conejo Valley is not the only 
district that has found the concept attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Ventura Unified School District launched two 
mini-continuation schools -- Ventura Islands and Buena Vista -- two years ago 
on the campuses of Ventura and Buena high schools. Like the proposed Thousand 
Oaks program, students in Ventura's programs attend a shortened school day and 
are allowed to take one elective through the larger high school. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel McCurtis, principal of Pacific High School, the off-campus 
continuation school, said both Ventura Islands and Buena Vista are used for 
early intervention, to help students before they are sent to his campus because 
of failing grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, he said, students who stay on their own campus are more likely to return 
to a regular classroom than those transferred to Pacific's continuation high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes if you keep them too long, they don't want to return," he said.

DEVELOPER OFFERS SIMI $3.6 MILLION TO BUILD HOMES; GROWTH: FIRM SEEKS EXEMPTION 
FROM RESIDENTIAL LIMITS. CITY COUNCIL SAYS THE DEAL WOULD ENSURE CONSTRUCTION 
OF UP TO 550 HIGH-QUALITY HOUSES WHILE BRINGING IN NEEDED REVENUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A developer whose attempts to build as many as 550 homes in Simi Valley have 
stalled repeatedly in the past decade is offering to pay the city nearly $3.6 
million in exchange for an exemption from the city's residential growth-control 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal would allow Long Beach Equities to build the homes on an 892-acre 
plot, known as Marr Ranch, north of the city.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday conceptually approved the plan, saying the 
agreement would ensure construction of high-quality homes and bring needed 
revenue into the city's coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the way the economy's been, I think we have a little catching up to do," 
Councilwoman Barbara Williamson said. "This is a win-win situation where we'll 
get some beautiful homes and some funds for city projects at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming months, the City Council and the Planning Commission will hold 
public hearings on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council action is just a preliminary testing of the waters," said Laura 
Kuhn, deputy director of advanced planning. "The action isn't binding until we 
go through the public hearing process." 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan receives final council approval, Long Beach Equities would seek to 
annex Marr Ranch to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Friedman, president of Long Beach Equities, said in addition to the cash, 
his company would donate to the city up to 1,800 acres of parkland in the Marr 
Ranch area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long time coming on this project and we hope we're going to make 
it happen this time," Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Marr Ranch falls within Simi Valley's "sphere of influence," meaning it is 
designated for eventual annexation and is included in the city's General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Equities first began planning the Marr Ranch development more than 
a decade ago. But just as the project was getting off the ground, planning for 
all new developments was halted pending an overhaul of the city's General Plan. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1986 voters ushered in the growth-control ordinance, further delaying 
plans for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking an exemption from the ordinance, Long Beach Equities sued the city in 
1988, but lost in the state's 2nd Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the 10-year growth-control plan, a variable, limited number of permits 
is available each year. 
</P>
<P>
 The permits are allocated annually among competing developers based on a range 
of criteria including project design, public amenities and the number of 
affordable units. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993-94, applications for 320 houses were approved. The growth ordinance 
does not apply to commercial construction. 
</P>
<P>
 With the growth-control ordinance up for renewal in 1996, Marr Ranch 
developers resumed negotiations with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Marr Ranch proposal, the developer would be granted a prearranged 
exception to the growth ordinance, if it is renewed. The agreement would allow 
construction of up to 137 homes a year for four years, beginning in November, 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically we would eventually get the building permits anyhow," Friedman 
said. "But in this case we would be able to do it quicker." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago the city hammered out a similar but grander agreement with 
the developers of Wood Ranch, exempting the project from the city's 
growth-control ordinance and clearing the way for completion of the 4,000-home 
community on the city's west end. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite funding problems and recession-related delays with the Wood Ranch 
project, council members said they are confident the Marr Ranch agreement will 
be a good deal for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is much smaller and less complex than the arrangement we had with Wood 
Ranch," said Mayor Greg Stratton, who is helping negotiate a development 
agreement with Long Beach Equities. "I think in this case we are going for a 
more straightforward approach."

CITIZENS PANEL TO PRESENT PLAN FOR TEACHING VIA PUBLIC TV; THOUSAND OAKS: 
COMMITTEE WANTS A NONPROFIT FOUNDATION TO SUPPLEMENT CHANNEL 8 WITH MORE 
ACCESSIBLE PRODUCTION FACILITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Math tips and cooking hints, safety videos and surfing lessons could someday 
share airspace on a new public-access cable channel run by a nonprofit 
foundation that would be dedicated to televised teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks City Council tonight will discuss a 70-page report calling 
for a public education station that would be funded by donations and local 
cable franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed, the educational broadcast would supplement Channel 8, a 
public-access station aired in Thousand Oaks, Camarillo and Moorpark that has 
offered everything from religious messages to psychedelic graphics to 
inspirational interviews with the rich and famous. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make (cable) larger, make it better, make it more accessible to 
people," said retired film production professor M. Ali Issari, who sits on a 
citizens advisory committee that will present the report to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "Human beings thrive on creation," Issari said. Through the new channel, he 
said, "people will learn the satisfaction of communicating. They have something 
to say, and they will say it on television." 
</P>
<P>
 To help residents of all ages have their say on television, the committee 
recommends establishing a nonprofit foundation to run a brand-new, high-tech 
studio, preferably in the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Elementary schoolchildren, college students, senior citizens or anyone else 
interested in cable production could swing by City Hall and learn how to put 
together a television show. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the committee's proposal, Moorpark College professors could offer 
televised lectures. Thousand Oaks students could film their own plays. 
Principals could record soccer games or PTA meetings, or broadcast school lunch 
menus. 
</P>
<P>
 The station would be "virtually as creative as the mind can be," city Media 
Services Manager Shirley Cobb said. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of an all-education station and state-of-the-art studio thrills 
some local TV producers, who say they are frustrated with Channel 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Cablevision runs Channel 8 out of a small studio in Agoura 
Hills. The company offers periodic training classes, keeps five cameras on hand 
for residents and pays four full-time staff members to help the amateur 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But residents still complain that VCC does not offer them enough support, 
equipment or training to pull together slick productions. A nonprofit group 
dedicated to public access, they said, could boost both the quantity and the 
quality of amateur shows. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ventura County Cablevision studio, "there's no encouragement, no one 
saying 'Yes, you can do it, this is fun,' " said Lori Rai, a committee member. 
"Public access is a bother to them -- they have a television station to run." 
</P>
<P>
 VCC Vice President for Operations Dan Deutsch said the complaints might have 
"some merit," and added that he applauds the push for an educational station 
run by a nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deutsch questioned the need for an expensive new studio -- and said he 
wasn't sure his cable company could underwrite the cost. He said only about 15 
people a week use the VCC cameras for public-access shows, and another 25 a 
week work in the editing room. 
</P>
<P>
 Equipping a new studio would cost at least $400,000, committee members said. 
Rent and staff salaries could run the cost up considerably as well, though no 
one has precise figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is, VCC is spending a big chunk of change on public access," said 
Carl Jarecky, the city's cable systems coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 VCC is negotiating a new cable franchise agreement with the city and could end 
up agreeing to cover part of the cost of an educational channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the company also has obligations to Camarillo and Moorpark residents. To 
support the Thousand Oaks project, Deutsch said, VCC might have to pass the 
cost on to local cable customers in the form of a line item on the monthly 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you build it, will they come?" he asked. "Is there that much interest out 
there? That will determine whether this will fly."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; PROTESTERS ACT TO SAVE 24 TREES DEEMED UNSAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 30 Ojai residents came to a wooded lot Monday to protest a developer's 
plans to cut down 24 eucalyptus trees to make way for six condominiums at the 
corner of Lion and Aliso streets. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials assured angry residents that the lost trees would be replaced 
with sycamore and oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
 They pointed to a study that said the eucalyptus trees are unsafe, leaving the 
developer no choice but to cut them down. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents were not convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be sure that those trees cannot be saved," said Susa Francina, a 
38-year-old Ojai resident. "Whatever they build in that lot has to be in 
harmony with the environment. We are not sure if the study was thorough." 
</P>
<P>
 The study, funded by the developer, was conducted by an arborist who 
frequently works on contract for the city, said William Prince, the city's 
building and planning director.  
</P>
<P>
 Prince said that the study was rigorous, finding that only nine of the 33 
trees could be saved. 
</P>
<P>
 "If left there, those trees would be dangerous to the health and safety of the 
people who will be living in the condominiums," Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trees, Prince said, are old and were improperly cropped a few years ago so 
that their branches have grown horizontally, making them more prone to toppling 
over.  
</P>
<P>
 Prince said the Planning Commission, which approved the project and the 
developer's request to cut down the trees, will not reconsider its decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very satisfied with the study," Prince said, "The planning commissioners 
knew exactly what they were doing when they made their decision." CHRISTINA

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: LIBRARY OFFICIALS FEAR 'DEVASTATING' CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to slash $1.6 million from an already diminished county libraries 
budget has officials worried that they may no longer be able to provide even 
the minimal service and restricted hours now offered. 
</P>
<P>
 County Chief Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg has recommended that 
Ventura County supervisors cut a $1.6-million grant from the Library Services 
Agency budget to help offset a $16-million budget shortfall countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 The library's current $6.5-million budget has already been cut by one-third 
from the 1991 spending plan of $10.1 million, said Library Services Agency 
Director Dixie D. Adeniran. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that (additional $1.6 million) were subtracted, we would be at less than 
half of the funding that we were at three years ago," she said. "And that would 
be very devastating." 
</P>
<P>
 The budget-cutting recommendation, to be considered today, comes just as three 
communities are scheduled to donate more than $12,000 to keep their branch 
libraries open more hours each week. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a proposal that also will be considered today, the communities of 
Meiners Oaks, Ojai and Camarillo would donate more than $12,000 to add two to 
three hours a week to the individual library schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the board, the Soroptimist International of Camarillo would 
donate $6,000 to keep the Camarillo branch library open an extra two hours each 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Meiners Oaks Lions Club would donate $600 to keep that library office open 
for three hours on Monday mornings through August, and the city of Ojai and the 
Ojai Valley Friends of the Library would donate a total of $5,490 to keep the 
downtown Ojai library open up to 46 hours a week through Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Adeniran said she hopes the Board of Supervisors will find somewhere else to 
cut to offset its shortfall. JEFF McDONALD

 An Oxnard man faces felony drug charges after he was caught tending 56 
marijuana plants near the grounds of Camarillo State Hospital, Ventura County 
sheriff's detectives said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Martin Rodriguez, 30, was being held at the Ventura County Jail on Monday 
on suspicion of cultivation of marijuana, sheriff's officials said.His bail was 
set at $20,000, and he is scheduled to be arraigned today in Ventura County 
Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 A tipster told sheriff's detectives that marijuana was growing in a small 
ravine near the intersection of Lewis Road and Hueneme Road in Camarillo, 
outside the state hospital grounds, Detective Bob Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives staked out the garden and caught Rodriguez refilling a makeshift 
drip system he had built to feed water to the plants through pinholes drilled 
into milk jugs, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said he and other detectives arrested Rodriguez and confiscated the 1- 
to 3 1/2-foot-tall plants. MACK REED

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; FARM WORKER BUS LINE SUED FOR SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A bus line catering to farm workers going to Tijuana and Fresno operates 
unsafe coaches, the Ventura County district attorney's office charged Monday in 
a lawsuit against Transportes Intercalifornias Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit is the prosecutors' office latest attempt to get the Los 
Angeles-based company to comply with state safety regulations, Deputy Dist. 
Atty.Michael D. Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has a local office in Oxnard, at 102 E. 5th St. 
</P>
<P>
 Filed in Superior Court, the lawsuit asks that Transportes be required to fix 
its unsafe buses and pay $2,500 for each of several dozen alleged violations. 
</P>
<P>
 A defense lawyer said the company will file a denial to the charges in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're certainly concerned with having safe buses," attorney Frederick H. 
Bysshe Jr. said. "In terms of what the bottom line is, these buses have 
traveled millions of miles without any major accidents." 
</P>
<P>
 A news release from Bysshe's office said Transportes is a Latino-owned company 
that is popular because all of its drivers speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportes carries about 300,000 passengers annually, including about 40,000 
from its Oxnard office, Bysshe said. 
</P>
<P>
 It has a fleet of 13 buses, which travel between Tijuana, Los Angeles, Oxnard 
and Fresno, Bysshe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Transportes is forced out of business by an overzealous district 
attorney's office, this segment of the public transportation market will revert 
back to unlicensed, underground, and fly-by-night operators," the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991 and last year, Transportes was put on probation for operating unsafe 
buses, Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's lawsuit claims that its buses have faulty brakes, holes in 
floorboards and inoperable emergency doors. Drivers' complaints about defects 
have been ignored, it says. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportes' buses have received unsatisfactory marks on eight inspections by 
the Highway Patrol since 1991, Schwartz said. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CITY SUES INSURERS OVER KEYS DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Ventura sued two dozen insurance companies Monday, saying the 
insurers have refused to reimburse the city for expenses from a costly legal 
battle with homeowners of the Ventura Keys. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit, filed in Ventura County Superior Court, the city claims the 
insurers have refused to cover more than $1 million spent on legal fees so far. 
</P>
<P>
 The subdivision consists of 302 residential lots fronting the Ventura Harbor 
on man-made channels. Nearly one-third of the residents filed a lawsuit against 
the city and county after the City Council in 1991 levied assessments on 
homeowners to cover dredging costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The property owners allege that silt and debris have washed through the 
Arundell Barranca into the Keys, blocking their channels, the lawsuit said. It 
said the property owners are seeking $20 million from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura city leaders are close to reaching a settlement with homeowners and 
are reportedly drafting a formal agreement, said City Atty. Peter D. Bulens.  
</P>
<P>
 The city accuses the 24 insurance companies of acting in bad faith by failing 
to make reimbursements.  
</P>
<P>
 The suit said the city purchases annual liability and indemnity policies, 
which entitle the city to reimbursement of legal expenses, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the insurance companies -- including Admiral Insurance Co. and Aetna 
Insurance Co. -- have refused to investigate claims by the city and either 
grant or deny coverage. Representatives of several of the insurance companies 
could not be reached for comment. DWAYNE BRAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: 6 WORKERS SOUGHT FOR CHILD-SUPPORT CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The clerk of Ventura County Superior and Municipal courts and the district 
attorney will ask the Board of Supervisors today to approve hiring up to six 
people, including a court commissioner, to help process a huge load of 
child-support cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Courts Executive Officer Sheila Gonzalez and Dist. Atty.Michael D. Bradbury 
said they need the commissioner, one judicial assistant, three court assistants 
and a deputy sheriff to process more than 21,000 cases this year, a 105% 
increase from two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The request comes at a time when the county is facing a $16-million budget 
deficit for the upcoming fiscal year, which begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez and Bradbury said state and federal funds will cover the bulk of the 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura County would be obligated for up to $125,000 for the positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Both administrators said the positions are needed because the child-support 
division is likely to lose its exemption from state and federal mandates that 
require 90% of cases to be closed within three months. 
</P>
<P>
 The provisions also call for 98% of the cases to be closed within six months 
and all of the cases to be completed within one year from the date they are 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The increasing number of cases cannot be handled with existing court 
resources in the timeframes mandated by federal regulations and state 
statutes," a report to the supervisors states. 
</P>
<P>
 Early last year, the district attorney's office received permission to hire 
100 new clerks to handle child-support cases. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gonzalez said her office was never provided extra staff to process the 
accompanying caseload. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: EXPERTS TO SPEAK ON STATE FISCAL CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two experts on the California budget will discuss the state's chronic fiscal 
problems at a public meeting today with Ventura County and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Sue North, from the nonprofit California Citizens Budget Commission, will 
address spending patterns that contribute to constant deficits.Kevin Scott, a 
consultant and former budget "watchdog," will examine revenue problems created 
by the tax system. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's financial difficulties affect local governments, stripping the 
county, cities and school districts of revenue they are counting on for their 
budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Gov. Pete Wilson announced additional cuts that could force 
communities to turn over more property tax revenue and could dip into federal 
funds the communities use for health care programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The county begins its budget hearings today with preliminary projections from 
Chief Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg. The governor's new spending 
cuts could add millions to the county budget deficit, which already stands at 
$16 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, as well as city officials from around the county, will hear from 
the two consultants at 5 p.m. today in the Board of Supervisors hearing room at 
the government center. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; STUDENT ADVISERS GET VOTE ON SCHOOL 
BOARD

<P>
 The Conejo Valley school board will soon have a new voting member. 
</P>
<P>
 According to district officials, student advisers to the elected five-member 
board have earned the right to cast votes on all public matters.The votes will 
become part of the official record but carry no weight in the official votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, elected student representatives must be allowed to cast 
non-binding, advisory votes if at least 500 students sign a petition supporting 
the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Thousand Oaks High School student Michelle Quist presented 
district officials with a petition carrying the required number of signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees of the Conejo Valley Unified School District will discuss tonight the 
guidelines that will be used to choose the voting student advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, student advisers from each of the district's four high schools 
gave brief reports on campus activities at the beginning of each meeting, but 
they did not participate in policy discussions or cast votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Mildred Lynch expressed concern Monday that the students would 
lack a thorough understanding of district issues before casting their votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They won't have the background for it," she said. "Most of what we do is not 
just paper there at the board meeting. It's what's gone on before. Everything 
has history." JULIE FIELDS

 Fire gutted one Simi Valley apartment and damaged another Monday afternoon, 
injuring no one but claiming the life of a cat. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Fire Department investigators have determined that smoking 
materials caused the fire, which began in a first-floor apartment in the 200 
block of Ventura Avenue at about 3:25 p.m., said Sandi Wells, a department 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire spread to the apartment directly above and went to two alarms before 
it was finally quelled by about 18 Ventura County firefighters, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 The families who lived in the apartments were not home at the time the fire 
broke out, she said. MACK REED

THUMBS UP FOR STORCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am surprised and saddened by the controversy surrounding Judge Lawrence 
Storch. I do not know the judge personally, nor am I involved in any way with 
the Ventura County court system.I was a juror, however, on a murder trial in 
Judge Storch's courtroom. The verdict in our case was the opposite to that in 
the Todd Love case. In a compromise verdict, our jury voted second-degree 
murder in a case that the preponderance of the evidence seemed to indicate 
first-degree murder. When the defendant's attorney pleaded for leniency, Judge 
Storch ruled that the jury had already offered all the leniency possible under 
law by declaring a second-degree murder verdict. In turn, Judge Storch imposed 
the maximum sentence possible. 
</P>
<P>
 During the proceedings, we the jurors found Judge Storch attentive, fair, 
knowledgeable and impartial. In my opinion, the fact that Judge Storch took a 
tough stance in one case and a more lenient stance in the Love case is 
undoubtedly proof of his impartiality rather than his leniency, as the district 
attorney alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 I was very impressed with the judge during our trial. His 20 years' experience 
on the bench were apparent and a comfort to me and my fellow jurors. I don't 
know how long Mr. Bradbury has been district attorney, but from what I've read 
so far of this controversy, I'd take Judge Storch's wisdom over that of 
Bradbury any day.

SHIP OUT VELTHOEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Ventura's need for a new city manager has inspired people down 
here in Port Hueneme to do their part. We are willing to sacrifice, and do we 
have a deal for you. It could be that Port Hueneme City Manager Dick Velthoen 
is about ready to move on to bigger and better things. In any event, even if he 
isn't quite ready, people down here are. Parts of Mr. Velthoen have just 
outgrown our little town, and he really needs more room to roam, a bigger piece 
of the pie, another sheep to fleece, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Velthoen has a particular passion (or obsession, depending on your point 
of view) for developing a fancy RV resort so as to impress his fat-cat friends. 
This has caused trouble in Port Hueneme, where the yokels don't understand that 
the "trickle down" from their wallets to City Hall is for the greater good. 
</P>
<P>
 As it happens, Ventura already has an RV resort, and it has fallen on hard 
times. So Mr. Velthoen could just apply some of the techniques he has learned 
in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, what you do is declare this resort to be an amenity rather than the 
blight that it really is. Then you can charge extra for any citizen who has a 
view of it, or who can see someone else who can see it. In Hueneme we get some 
consultant to come in and testify that this will actually increase property 
values. This makes it all legit, while having the added benefit of firing up 
the yokels at the same time. I admit I'm not real sure how it works -- no one 
does other than Dick, and that's the beauty of it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spirit of disclosure I have to admit that Dick will cost a whole lot 
more than Mr. Baker did, but worth every extra thousand, I guarantee. Also, we 
will provide free transportation for Dick out of Hueneme. I didn't catch all 
the details, but I recall that it somehow involves a rail.

PRAYER AT BUENA HIGH GRADUATION PROMPTS DISSENT; VENTURA: FORMER STUDENTS 
BELIEVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS WERE VIOLATED BY THE UNANNOUNCED 
BENEDICTION. PRINCIPAL SAYS THE NONDENOMINATIONAL SPEECH WAS LEGAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying that their constitutional rights have been violated, two recent Buena 
High School graduates are organizing a protest about a prayer that was read at 
their graduation ceremony without their consent. 
</P>
<P>
 The prayer, which invoked a "father" but made no reference to God, was not on 
the written program for the graduation ceremony held on the Buena High quad in 
Ventura on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 And graduates Amber Mills and Amy Israel both said they were caught by 
surprise when one of their classmates mounted the stage and urged the audience 
to bow their heads for a benediction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of in shock," the 18-year-old Mills said. "I don't have a problem 
with people being religious. But when it's imposed on other people, and I 
really feel this was imposed on our graduating class, I just don't think that's 
right. I think its an imposition on my right to believe as I want to." 
</P>
<P>
 Following the ceremony, Mills and Israel asked other classmates if they had 
also been upset.  
</P>
<P>
 The two graduates and one of their classmates have made an appointment with 
Buena High Principal Jaime Castellanos to voice their complaint. And they said 
they have found at least six additional recent graduates who were offended by 
the prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't feel it was right," graduate Danny Slaton said about the 
prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Castellanos said Monday that he will explain to the students Wednesday 
that the prayer was legal. 
</P>
<P>
 A ruling in 1993 by the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals allows such worship 
if it is initiated by students and approved by a majority of their classmates. 
The U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the appeals court decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a right to do it," Castellanos said. "My hands are tied legally." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the school had a prayer at its graduation last year that had also been 
initiated by students. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This year, students came to his office on the day before with a petition 
signed by about 250 of their fellow seniors, more than half of the class of 
about 450. The petition asked for a prayer at their commencement ceremony. It 
did not specify the prayer's language. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 1993 appeals court case cleared the way for non-sectarian 
prayers, other court cases are pending about whether such student-initiated 
prayers may be overtly religious. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Ventura Unified School District, Castellanos said, officials have 
decided only to allow student prayers without words tied to any particular 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal said he gave the students precise instructions about words they 
could and could not use in the prayer. While the words "God" and "Jesus" are 
forbidden, "father" is allowed.  
</P>
<P>
 "Whether you call him father or mother, I don't see that in my opinion as 
favoring one religion over another," Castellanos said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mills and Israel said the word "father" contributed to the overall 
Christian tenor of the prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Both girls said they come from non-religious families. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said it was nondenominational," Israel said. "But what about Buddhism? 
What about Hinduism? What about those religions where 'our father' doesn't 
apply?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although Israel said she knew petitions were being passed during graduation 
week, she had expected seniors would have an opportunity to vote on whether 
there would be a prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a vote, she said it was impossible to know if all the signatures were 
valid. 
</P>
<P>
 But Erin Weir, who wrote the prayer and who was one of six seniors who passed 
petitions, said gathering signatures was easier than holding a formal vote.

 Weir said she wrote the prayer to appeal to people with a wide range of 
beliefs.  
</P>
<P>
 But she and other students who supported the benediction said it had been 
important to them to offer a prayer at their high school graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't to stand militantly (and say,) 'We're going to force this down your 
throats,' " said 18-year-old Damon Delillo, a former president of the school's 
Bible club who read the prayer at the commencement. "It was a declaration of 
our hope and of God's guidance all through high school and it was just kind of 
a prayer that God would continue to do this all through our lives." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Both Mills and Israel emphasized that they did not want to finish high school 
on a bad note; they said they liked Buena, its principal and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Their purpose in meeting with Castellanos, they said, is to ask if there is 
some way to prevent similar prayers at future graduations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Castellanos said his only power is to review the wording in prayers put 
forward by students. And even that is difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tricky area," he said. "Where do you draw the line?" Words of 
Benediction 
</P>
<P>
 Text of the prayer delivered at the Buena High graduation June 16:  
</P>
<P>
 Father we come before you. We thank you for guiding our paths daily, for 
putting important people in our lives to help us along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 We know we need you to see us through the rest of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 And we thank you that we are never far from your love. 
</P>
<P>
 That every day of our lives is ordained by you. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that you are the preserver of men and guide our footsteps, we thank 
you. 
</P>
<P>
 We ask that your loving hand would be there to hold us and to carry us 
throughout the rest of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 We ask that we would see clearly the way to abounding life. 
</P>
<P>
 As we bestow our lives into your guidance and direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Please show us your goodness, mercy and compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 Amen.

CUT OFF SEVERANCE FOR ELECTED OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is clear that the special interest group favored by those in county 
management is still county management itself. The saga of the hidden perks, 
thanks to county management, is an issue that seems to be enjoying everlasting 
life. These perks, remember, were taken under the table in lieu of pay 
increases to avoid public scrutiny and to make the compensation paid to county 
management appear less than it was by almost half. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught with their hands in the public purse, and faced with the resulting 
public outrage, the county managers agreed to give up their hidden perks (but 
only after a threatened lawsuit) in return for a very generous 30% pay 
increase. There is one perk, however, that has been tantamount to taking a beef 
bone away from a junk yard dog: severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's name names. Elected officials who have already walked out of office with 
your tax dollars in the form of severance pay and the amounts received by them 
are: Sheriff Gillespie ($72,158), Auditor Norm Hawkes ($71,120), Supervisor 
Madge Schaefer ($16,384), Supervisor Dougherty ($48,514) and Assessor Sandford 
($37,132). 
</P>
<P>
 Those still in office who will receive severance pay, and the amounts for 
which they are scheduled, are as follows: Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury 
($67,175), County Clerk Richard Dean ($55,912), Treasurer Hal Pittman 
($26,585), and Supervisors John Flynn ($40,307), Maggie Kildee ($40,509), Susan 
Lacey ($39,937), Vicky Howard ($8,535) and Maria VanderKolk ($9,235). 
</P>
<P>
 By what stretch of the imagination should elected politicians receive 
severance pay, or any type of longevity pay for that matter, when they are 
simply being voted out of office or resigning? If this abuse of the voter's 
trust angers you, please phone these self-serving government officials at their 
county offices and insist that they sign a waiver agreeing to give up the 
severance pay.

DIVIDED OVER RV PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the recent city council meeting regarding the proposed Port Hueneme RV 
park, many of us left with feelings of deep concern over the bitter 
divisiveness here in our city. Nasty comments and jeers from both sides have 
been continually swapped in the long and intense battle.Our local residents 
that live right in front of the proposed site have experienced extreme property 
devaluation since the issue began, and in the event the RV park does go 
through, their values will most likely take an additional 30% decrease. This 
ongoing battle has cut deeply into the heart of our town and I fear that it 
will continue for many years to come as homeowners steadily lose their lifelong 
investments. It is definitely inflicting unforgiving emotional scars and 
financial distress. 
</P>
<P>
 The people I used to smile at and say hello to in town now exchange angry 
glares, and we avoid one another like the plague. We have our city leaders to 
thank for this. Instead of building a city that stands united, they have 
succeeded in making neighbors and fellow citizens enemies. They may as well 
have driven a stake through this town's heart. I miss the way things used to 
be.

CONFRONTING CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The crime symposium of May 7 generated the usual amount of rhetoric, a lot of 
it "old hat," some of it a little different in its approach to discouraging 
crime in our community. After all, the need for neighborhood involvement is, 
and has been, an accepted fact for some time now, and the root causes of crime 
such as family breakdowns, permissiveness and low self-esteem, have been 
recognized time and again. It was noteworthy that the attendees were anxious to 
quickly move beyond these accepted phrases and get to what they feel should be 
the meat of the symposium -- possible solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the solutions presented, one of the most logical and possibly most feasible 
dealt with establishing a local juvenile hall in the old east valley sheriff's 
station. Transporting a local offender to a location nearby where beds are 
available and a 48-hour detention period is more likely, might very well have a 
more sobering effect, than a trip to Ventura which results in a 45-minute 
release because of the lack of facilities for incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
 In a conversation with Chief Deputy Bob Brooks, I discovered that getting the 
officer back on the street quickly and discouraging kids who are on the 
"fringe" of gang involvement before they get totally caught up are two of the 
most effective means of controlling and preventing escalating gang activity. 
While gangs now account for about 12% of total crime in Thousand Oaks, they 
account for a much greater percentage of violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 If we dovetail this procedure with the use of citizen volunteers, trained by 
the Sheriff's Citizen Academy, to help process these juveniles, we could 
expedite the return of officers to the place they are most needed and effective 
-- on the street. Not a new idea, but possibly one whose time has come. 
Certainly it merits further consideration.

NAMELESS BIGOTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bigotry is wrong, but it is alive and growing in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 This past week we have seen two examples of ethnic, religious and racial 
bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
 Two "anonymous" leaflets were distributed at school campuses. The authors 
refused to name themselves, nor are they willing to come forward. Both remind 
me of the Ku Klux Klan, hiding behind sheets (paper), vicious, wrong and 
bigoted. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases we had religious bigotry. One against Jews and the other against 
Christians. Both were distributed by stealth, unwilling to face the light of 
day or debate. While neither broke the law, both seem so embarrassed by their 
views that they would not sign their real names to the documents. 
</P>
<P>
 That is truly the sign of radicalism and bigotry. The only reason you don't 
sign your name to a document is because you think it is illegal or that you are 
ashamed of your actions. 
</P>
<P>
 I call on the people of Simi Valley to denounce this bigotry. I urge the City 
Council to reform its human concerns committee so that the community can meet 
this challenge to harmony and tolerance.

DUMP TACONIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last year, when supervisors indicated that they would vote against the 
proposed Weldon dump, Waste Management Inc., quickly withdrew its application 
for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Taconic Resources, a company whose murky relationship to Waste Management 
is suspicious to say the least, has suddenly emerged with an initiative 
designed to bypass county decision-makers and site a dump at Weldon Canyon 
after all. This new effort to get around county government is being fronted by 
the green-sounding Ventura Citizens for Environmental Solutions. We imagine the 
Out-of-County Corp. for Dangerous but Lucrative Dumps somehow seemed a less 
appealing name to Taconic/Waste Management. 
</P>
<P>
 But that name really describes what's going on here. These folks aren't using 
their vast resources to help Ventura with a waste problem. Instead, they're 
looking to cash in big time. The proposed "solution" to waste disposal just so 
happens to allow construction of a huge cash cow that could operate around the 
clock for the next three generations. The fact that Ventura County's waste 
stream must be reduced as mandated by AB 939 won't make a dent in the dump 
operator's bottom-line profits. They can simply import trash and then become 
the Ventura Citizens for Solutions to L.A.'s Garbage Problems. 
</P>
<P>
 While all of this has brought back the debate over dumps, our position on 
these matters remains the same: Dumps represent a dangerous, backward answer 
and must be rejected. A year ago the coalition called for the closing of the 
Bailard dump for all the reasons that we believe Weldon should never open. 
Dumps degrade the environment. Dumps bring serious and unnecessary health 
dangers. Dumps are economically low yield. They do not treat refuse as an 
exploitable commodity and hence waste profit and job potentials for the host 
communities while simultaneously consuming valuable air credits needed for 
future development. 
</P>
<P>
 We must realize that in waste disposal we stand at a moment of historic 
change. The growing array of new methods and technologies that are coming on 
line give us the ability to avoid the environmental and health negatives of 
dumping and, at the same time, allow a fuller economic exploitation of the 
waste stream through recycling. The proposed initiative fails to recognize this 
new direction and would commit our county to a tragic, stone-age solution for 
at least three generations to come.

HIGH ON LOH

<P>
 I'm supporting Trudi Loh for Ventura County supervisor.  
</P>
<P>
 Trudi Loh is the only viable candidate that is questioning the immediate need 
for a new $30-$70 million county hospital addition. 
</P>
<P>
 In these uncertain times when we are going through major changes in health 
care, and county coffers are at an all-time low with the cutting of essential 
services, it's crazy to invest millions in precious tax dollars in building a 
new hospital facility which may not be needed in the health care system of the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Trudi Loh will be careful with our tax dollars. Trudi Loh is a strong and 
independent voice on waste of tax dollars for questionable facilities in a 
changing health care system. Why duplicate facilities which are underused in 
the private hospital?  
</P>
<P>
 Trudi Loh will be sure our tax dollars are spent on needed services and not on 
more county boondoggles. 
</P>
<P>
 Join me in voting for Trudi Loh for your tax dollars well spent.

IN SUPPORT OF DARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am a Chapter I teacher at El Rancho Structured School. I attended the 
hearing on May 11 regarding funding for the DARE program in the Camarillo 
schools.Due to my observations at the meeting, I felt compelled to express my 
feelings regarding the DARE program. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, I was working as a teacher in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District. I was able to observe firsthand the excellent program that the DARE 
officers present to the students, as well as the positive long-term effects on 
the children. During one of the sessions on how to deal with the knowledge that 
someone you know is using drugs, a fifth-grade female student of mine became 
noticeably upset. Because of her relationship with our DARE officer, she was 
able to confide that her 16-year-old brother was using drugs and she had known 
about it for some time. She had been suppressing her fears and anxieties for 
months, and this DARE presentation offered her the opportunity to deal with her 
feelings and the realities regarding the situation and her brother. 
</P>
<P>
 At the local meeting, it was stressed several times that the research shows 
there is no decrease in drug-related arrests where there is a DARE program in 
effect. I feel the statistics can't possibly show the many times the DARE 
program helps distressed young people either with their own problems regarding 
drugs or the problems someone close to them is having. Why do we have to wait 
until they become a statistic for the support of this superb program to become 
validated? Our children need this assistance before the fact, not after it.

SCHOOL BOARD FAILURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baseball. Sex. Drugs. Hypocrisy. Our school board chooses a severe punishment 
against coach, players and parents for a coach's action to help his assistants 
and the school district.Chances are that the school board wished they had 
thought of renting out the property to help finance the district's programs. If 
the coach had pocketed the money, then the board's decision would have been 
correct. He did not; he put the money back into the school's baseball program. 
</P>
<P>
 District health teachers routinely flaunt the abstinence-only policy currently 
in place in the district. They bring in "homosexual rights" advocates to 
massage the values of schoolchildren. Does the board suspend these health 
teachers for violating district policy? No. 
</P>
<P>
 In the recent stabbing trial, the judge lamented the situation at Valley View, 
where it appeared to him that alcohol-impaired students were being tolerated in 
the classroom. Nice learning environment for the good kids. 
</P>
<P>
 I say the school board has a liberal, double-standard policy that favors 
immorality and attacks programs and people they have little tolerance for. I 
suggest the health teachers be put under investigation, the coach absolved and 
the school board voted out. If there are not two good candidates to support in 
the November elections, I will run.

ADDITIONAL STATE WATER CONDUIT WOULD DISTURB ENVIRONMENT; RESOURCES: PIPELINE 
WOULD CAUSE MOSTLY TEMPORARY PROBLEMS FOR COMMUTERS OR WILDLIFE, DEPENDING ON 
ITS ROUTE, REPORT SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A second pipeline carrying state water into Ventura County would have 
significant but mostly temporary environmental impacts, water officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 All three of the proposed routes for a new Metropolitan Water District 
pipeline have some environmental drawbacks that must be mitigated, according to 
a draft environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 One route, along the Santa Clara River, could disturb and perhaps temporarily 
displace two endangered species that live along the waterway: the three-spined 
stickleback, a fish that dates from prehistoric times, and the least Bell's 
vireo, a tiny songbird that thrives near riverbeds, said Peter Jacobsen, MWD 
project manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Two alternate routes would have more direct impact on human beings -- 
particularly those who already sit in traffic on clogged freeways -- since the 
construction of the proposed pipeline would thread through well-populated areas 
of the San Fernando Valley for an estimated three to four years, Jacobsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the state project water imported into the county by MWD now comes 
through a pipeline from the San Fernando Valley and is distributed by the 
Calleguas Municipal Water District, which serves 450,000 users in east Ventura 
County, as well as Oxnard and Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 That pipeline runs through a tunnel in the Santa Susana Mountains east of Simi 
Valley and crosses a fault. Though plans for a second pipeline -- the West 
Valley Project -- have been underway for several years, growing concerns over 
the vulnerability of a system fed by one pipe were heightened by the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economic viability of Ventura County right now hangs on one thread," said 
Calleguas General Manager Don Kendall. "We need water flowing down a new line 
by the year 2000." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for a pipeline eight feet in diameter, which would double the 
capacity to carry state water into the county. However, Jacobsen said that 
could change as MWD re-evaluates some of its expenditures under a $6-billion 
capital improvement program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may rethink some of the sizing," Jacobsen said. "We could make the pipe 
smaller in diameter." 
</P>
<P>
 The capacity of the West Valley Project is projected to meet county demands 
based on expected growth through the year 2030. Though officials emphasized 
Monday that the environmental impact report for the project is still a first 
draft -- with a final draft expected by late summer -- they said they have 
targeted three possible routes for the West Valley Project, planned for 
completion by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 The first would run from Castaic Lake and roughly follow the course of the 
Santa Clara River. The second and third alternatives would parallel the Santa 
Susana pipeline already in place, and either be a nearly identical pipeline 
near the surface or buried in a deep tunnel. "The big issue on the Santa Clara 
River is the habitat and environmental concerns," Jacobsen said. He said MWD 
would build only during the dry season between June and October to avoid 
impacts on the three-spined stickleback. 
</P>
<P>
 The fish is highly adapted to the dry climate and takes refuge in small pools 
during summer months, where construction would have little or no impact, 
Jacobsen said. MWD would also reroute construction around nests of the least 
Bell's vireo, Jacobsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The pipeline would pass through Happy Camp Regional Park and part of the park 
would probably have to be closed temporarily, he said. In addition, about 86 
acres of citrus orchards would be removed and 51 acres of crops would be lost 
during the construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Kendall said several citrus growers have raised concerns in public hearings 
about dust raised by construction interfering with their pest control. However, 
he said, "we certainly didn't meet with any vehement protests."

O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW; ONLY THE HAIR WAS TRULY THERE 
</P>

 Word has it that the talent buyer at a hot new Hollywood nightclub had a 
particularly stressful evening not long ago. His headliner canceled at the last 
minute, after all 1,200 tickets to the show had been sold. Desperate to somehow 
salvage things, the buyer recalled that Little Richard lived right across the 
street. He called immediately and asked Richard's assistant to see if the rock 
legend would be willing to fill in. 
</P>
<P>
 After several tense moments, the assistant reportedly related the word: 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard says he regrets to tell you that his hair just is not prepared for 
such an eventuality." 
</P>
<P>
 The 61-year-old rock legend's hair most certainly was prepared for his early 
show at the Coach House Sunday night, as was his voice and those pumping, 
flying piano fingers of his. But little else was prepared, and what could have 
been a true rock event was instead a frustrating, uneven display of talent and 
pique. 
</P>
<P>
 His band showed up hours late for its sound check and wound up doing a cursory 
one after 7 p.m., when the show itself should have started. The results were a 
shortened performance, numerous microphone and feedback problems and, even at 
its best, a sound mix that obscured what people had come to hear: Richard's 
voice and piano. 
</P>
<P>
 That voice, that piano and the spirit that fired them blazed the trail for 
rock in the mid-'50s, showing just how wild and unfettered this music could be. 
Whatever nonsense syllables Little Richard Penniman may have uttered, his 
inescapable message was freedom.  
</P>
<P>
 He was a spectacle, and perhaps by being so -- by donning mascara and acting 
"the Bronze Liberace" -- his blackness seemed less a threat to white audiences. 
In any case, he was among the first to reach across the color line. But maybe 
that was just because no kid was going to settle for Pat Boone's pallid cover 
of "Long Tall Sally" when he or she could have the glorious train explosion 
that was Richard's rendition. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently Richard has reached a new generation of youth, recording such 
children's fare as "Itsy Bitsy Spider" with great success. Most in the audience 
Sunday, though, clearly were from his first generation of fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The 65-minute, 13-song show offered an especially itsy "Itsy Bitsy Spider" and 
a foray into country with one new song, a ballad called "No Place Like Home" 
(Richard omitted his current country version of "Somethin' Else," recorded with 
Tanya Tucker). The new song is basically one homey cliche, but it and Fats 
Domino's "Blueberry Hill" offered Richard his only opportunities to display the 
powerful, emotive ballad voice that lurks behind the mascara and the screaming. 
Those moments reminded one that Richard's singing was the prime influence on 
fellow Macon, Ga., native Otis Redding. 
</P>
<P>
 The quiet songs also afforded the only moments when one could hear Richard's 
voice clearly above the din of his six-piece band (which shared the stage with 
various members of the singer's entourage who were milling about up there). 
</P>
<P>
 With two bass players and that murky sound mix (we should point out that 
Richard's own sound man -- not the club's -- was at the controls), it often 
seemed less like The Little Richard Show than it did a Ronco "Great Bass Solos 
of the '60s" collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard's splendid piano work was even more buried. The set included several 
of his better burners including "Good Golly Miss Molly," "Lucille," "Jenny 
Jenny," "Long Tall Sally" and a breakneck "Ready Teddy." There also was a 
slowed-down version of "The Girl Can't Help It," with the band members chanting 
the chorus, and covers of Larry Williams' "Boney Moronie," Chuck Berry's "Rock 
and Roll Music" and a bit of Jimmy Reed's "Baby, What You Want Me to Do." 
</P>
<P>
 One would think that with those songs, Richard would have achieved a 
sufficient head of steam to go into orbit. But the momentum of the show was 
continually derailed by his stopping, sometimes in mid-song, for spoken 
digressions. 
</P>
<P>
 The longest was a complaint that came after he spotted a video camera in the 
audience. While one can sympathize with his concern about such transgressions, 
one might have hoped that a greater concern would have been entertaining his 
audience: He spent three minutes grumbling about the camera and only 47 seconds 
doing "Tutti Frutti" -- and only 12 of those seconds were him singing. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance was especially maddening because, amid the awful sound and 
Richard's own erratic showmanship, it was clear that the talent that shook rock 
into consciousness three decades ago remains intact. It takes a lot to keep 
talent that great just out of reach, but that's just what Richard and his team 
managed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief opening slot, comedian Just June offered a funky and cerebral 
routine.

MUSIC REVIEW; 'PIRATES' KEEPS MOVING -- NOT ALWAYS FORWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Perhaps inspired by Joseph Papp's then-controversial 1980 Broadway production, 
the Brea Theatre League is presenting its own new version of Gilbert & 
Sullivan's "The Pirates of Penzance" through Saturday in the Curtis Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Director and choreographer Nikki Hevesy, ties the action to the 20th Century 
through an added prologue, and spices up the staging by keeping the characters 
in almost constant motion. The result, produced by Darrell Connerton, is a 
lively and fun, if unsettling, revival. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea that an audience in 1994 cannot relate to artistic products of 
earlier periods unless they are somehow modified is a popular and problematic 
assumption. Is it producers' or directors' comment on our level of education, 
insularity and patience, or do they simply feel driven to re-create? Even if 
one agrees that ample precedent exists for liberal re-stagings, it seems 
reasonable and ethical to allow authors and composers to govern -- even after 
death -- whatever aspects of their product they invented or designed. Gilbert & 
Sullivan provided witty librettos and sprightly scores. In this production, 
Sullivan's melodies survived intact -- with an insertion of "Sorry Her Lot," 
from "H.M.S. Pinafore," in Act II -- but had to contend with a bizarre, 
synthesizer-heavy taped accompaniment left over from the League's 1988 staging. 
</P>
<P>
 Those melodies were sung with polish and personable characterization, 
particularly by Gretchen Weiss, Darren Buckels and David Kirk Grant, as Mabel, 
Frederic and the Pirate King. Raun Imperial breezed through Major-General 
Stanley's patter song, "Model of a Modern Major General" with humorous elan. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert's book suffered a new preface, supplied by Hevesy, in which Rob 
Wyatt's opening set -- the deck of a three-masted pirate ship -- first appears 
as an exhibit in a contemporary maritime museum, in which a boy named Bobbi 
dreams of high-seas adventures. 
</P>
<P>
 The same scenery then served the 19th-Century material -- caricatures of 
people, pirates included, who cannot escape their overblown sense of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition was thoughtfully corroborative, but the text paled in contrast to 
Gilbert's clever parody. In the final scene, little Bobbi (Aaron Braunstein) 
returned as a ring bearer, for a wedding between the pirates and the General's 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Brea Theatre League production of "Pirates of Penzance" by Gilbert & 
Sullivan continues through Saturday at the Curtis Theatre, 1 Civic Center 
Circle, Brea. Show times: 8 p.m. Wednesday through Friday; 2 and 8 p.m. 
Saturday. $7 to $12.50. (714) 990-7722.

COMPROMISE REACHED ON MUSEUM PLAN; BUDGET: LEGISLATORS LET L.A. PROJECT PROCEED 
BY SWITCHING SOURCE OF MUCH OF THE MONEY. USE OF QUAKE REPAIR FUNDS HAD RAISED 
AN OUTCRY FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A major flap over the funding of a $45-million construction project at the 
Museum of Science and Industry was resolved for the time being Monday when 
state legislators voted to let the plan go forward by simply switching the 
source of much of the money. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy, which has been one of the most contentious issues of this 
year's state budget hearings, stemmed from the project's use of millions of 
dollars originally designated for the repair and replacement of buildings 
damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue became inflamed during the last two weeks when Northern California 
legislators accused their counterparts to the south -- particularly those in 
the Los Angeles area -- of using shady tactics to get the money for the museum 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California legislators, in turn, bristled at the suggestion and said 
they had done nothing wrong. Instead, they said, the wording of the earthquake 
relief bill matched the needs of the museum, even if it happened to be by 
coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter was resolved Monday in a compromise designed to satisfy legislators 
from both ends of the state. A total of $16 million would be taken from the 
earthquake fund, the estimated cost for a basic retrofit of the museum. The 
rest of the $29 million would come from revenue bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, the joint legislative budget committee working on the problem 
approved the project, but with only a fraction of the earthquake funds 
originally designated. The decision by the committee is considered a virtual 
rubber-stamp for approval, but both the Assembly and Senate must approve the 
overall budget by a two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were able to demonstrate to the naysayers that we had gone forward 
completely in compliance with the law," said Assemblywoman Marguerite 
Archie-Hudson (D-Los Angeles). "I was offended by the allegations we had tried 
to put something over on the public." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) said he believes the budget 
conference committee had acted improperly and that other legislators had given 
in to the threat by black legislators that they would vote against the budget 
if money was not found for the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Its not acceptable to me," Kopp said. "It's good for Southern California at 
the expense of the rest of the state. And the sloth goes on." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, museum Executive Director Jeff Rudolph said he hoped this would be 
the last of the opposition to the project, which has been in the planning 
stages for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased with the committee's action to allow the project to proceed," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kopp said the agreement only would hasten the destruction of an historical 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's ill-advised and one that circumvents the rules," said Kopp. "I 
don't know what historical groups will do or what actions might be taken 
judicially."  
</P>
<P>
 The focus of the controversy at the museum centered on two structures, the 
Armory and the Ahmanson building, which make up two sides of the Exposition 
Park rectangle adjacent to the Los Angeles Coliseum. Both were built in 1912 
and both have been closed since 1990, when the state architect deemed them 
unsafe in the event of an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum officials said that in the course of their study, they determined that 
it would cost less to build a new structure than to retrofit both old 
buildings. But opponents said museum officials had toyed with the numbers by 
making the standards for retrofitted buildings too high, thereby artificially 
running up the cost of the old buildings to make a new one look more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The budget committee also said the language in the final budget should be such 
that the museum could lease the Armory to the Los Angeles Unified School 
District for the development of a science school. But that does not mean the 
Armory could not be razed if it was seen as the best way to go in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Armory will at some time have to be severely redesigned or razed because 
of the school," Archie-Hudson said. "That building is on the table for several 
years down the pike."

FIGHTING FAIR; COMMUNITY WORK: TWICE WEEKLY, GANG MEMBERS TAKE FITNESS AND KICK 
BOXING LESSONS FROM SUPER-LIGHTWEIGHT HECTOR LOPEZ AND OTHERS. THEY LEARN 
RESPECT AND DISCIPLINE, THE EX-CONVICT SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hector Lopez is making the gang boys sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 Not in some airless room down at police headquarters, but in a Van Nuys gym 
heavy with the sound of fists on pads. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, one of the world's top-ranked super-lightweight fighters, is telling a 
dozen young men to jog in place until their shorts are wet around the 
midsection and a fine wet sheen is covering the tattoos that identify the 
neighborhood allegiances for which so many like them have died.  
</P>
<P>
 A young man with SANFER emblazoned on his chest and a nasty scar crawling up 
his ankle shifts into a fighting pose, making sharp exhaling noises through his 
nose as he boxes the air. 
</P>
<P>
 A half-smile softens Lopez's hard-eyed fighter's countenance.  
</P>
<P>
 Most people could not afford to buy the kind of training Lopez doles out to 
these young men for free. Lopez's belief, etched in his own experience, is that 
society cannot afford not to give it to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice a week, anywhere from 10 to 35 gang members attend these grueling 
training sessions at the Jet Center gym, which is owned and operated by 
champion kick boxers Benny (the Jet) Urquidez and William (Blinky) Rodriguez, 
along with Rodriguez's wife, Lilly, herself a champion fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, the principal instructor in the training classes, brings another 
perspective to the table: He is one of the architects of the peace treaty 
between Latino gangs in the San Fernando Valley that has lasted the past seven 
months. Though the truce has not been without problems -- isolated shootings 
and beatings have flared up between rival neighborhoods -- there have been no 
killings of gang members in that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Why teach gangbangers to fight? Isn't that already their specialty? 
</P>
<P>
 Because what these young men lack, Lopez and Rodriguez explain, is the 
knowledge of how to fight fair, and how to respect the combat they have chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time they begin their gym sessions, they bow to each other. When they 
leave, they bow to the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Rodriguez, 23, is a big kid with a shaved head and a body that he has 
hardened up considerably over the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, you had one thing in mind: getting in fights," says Rodriguez, who 
has spent 16 months in jail for carrying a weapon and has a scar from being 
stabbed in the head. "Here they're teaching us discipline." 
</P>
<P>
 The discipline keeps him focused on his responsibilities, he says. He has a 
wife and two young children, and for the past two years he has worked for a 
telecommunications company in its fraud division. 
</P>
<P>
 "I give a lot to Hector and Blinky," he says. "They're not getting paid for 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 For Lopez, his work with the gang members is a kind of pay-back. He still 
bears his own neighborhood identifier, a tattoo on his back that says 
"Toonerville," a tribute to Los Angeles' Atwater district.  
</P>
<P>
 Once one of Southern California's most promising young fighters, Lopez was a 
silver medalist for his native Mexico in the 1984 Olympics and seemed a 
certainty for professional fame. He built an impressive record as a 
featherweight, gaining the No. 1 ranking in the world. "But I couldn't get a 
title shot," he says. "I let frustration get in." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 9, 1988, he was arrested on suspicion of kidnaping his girlfriend at 
gunpoint. Convicted of two assault charges, he was sentenced to three years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a real bad temper," he confesses simply. 
</P>
<P>
 Since being released two years ago, he has re-established his career, married 
the woman he was accused of kidnaping and become involved in Rodriguez's 
church, Victory Outreach. When Rodriguez told him he had started a training 
class for gang members and asked him to help, Lopez quickly agreed to help, 
even though his own training schedule leaves him exhausted by the time the 
evening classes at the Jet Center roll around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like Blinky and my pastor were there to help me," Lopez says. "If I 
can pass it on, so much the better. I'm glad I'm out here." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez has an obvious and immediate rapport with the young men he teaches. When 
he goes up on his toes to demonstrate a move, his fluid self-control is 
obvious. When he tells them to give him 50 pushups, there is barely a groan of 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been there sitting in the same holding tank they're sitting in," Lopez 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows people would pay him a considerable sum for the training he is 
donating.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm making treasures in heaven," he says with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
 The real payoff is in the words of people like Raul Rodriguez, who is thankful 
for the truce, and says it has shown him a new world without invisible borders 
of danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels safer," he says. "Now I'm able to go to my grandma's house and not 
get shot by a rival gang."

HOUSING PROVIDERS MISS GOLDEN CHANCE; BUREAUCRACY: RED TAPE AND IMPATIENT BANKS 
KEEP DEVELOPERS OF LOW-INCOME DWELLINGS FROM PICKING UP FORECLOSED APARTMENT 
BUILDINGS AT BARGAIN PRICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Financial institutions are selling a record number of Los Angeles apartment 
houses that are in foreclosure, and investors are picking up buildings for a 
song. 
</P>
<P>
 But one group -- low-income housing providers -- has been curiously absent 
from the boom in apartments gone bust. 
</P>
<P>
 These developers, financed largely by taxpayers, have continued to build new 
apartments for the poor at an average cost of $150,000 each, even though units 
in foreclosure are available from lenders for an average price of only $37,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "What an opportunity missed!" lamented Michael Teitz, professor of urban 
planning at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 Decisions to build may seem irrational, given that lenders unloaded 19,000 
foreclosed units in Los Angeles County last year, according to COMPS, a 
commercial property information firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, affordable-housing providers are virtually the only developers 
continuing to build, according to the Southern California Assn. of Governments. 
New construction in the six-county region has slowed to a crawl, with only 
6,000 building permits for new apartments taken out last year; low-income 
housing developers accounted for two-thirds of those. 
</P>
<P>
 Many low-income housing providers say they have tried to get into the 
foreclosure market only to find themselves stymied. 
</P>
<P>
 Their problem has been that lending institutions want to close deals faster 
than the low-income developers can persuade government agencies to fund their 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders say they are under pressure from government regulators to get the 
apartments quickly off their books, since they represent bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, said Antonio Sanchez, who manages the West Coast assets of the 
Federal National Mortgage Assn., known as Fannie Mae, a huge player in U.S. 
mortgage markets, is that "the government is at cross-purposes with itself." 
</P>
<P>
 While the government provides most of the money for low-income housing, it 
also discourages lending institutions from selling foreclosed properties to 
low-income housing providers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a political dilemma," Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to resolve it have been launched by some federal and local agencies. 
But it is unclear whether these efforts will succeed -- and whether they will 
do so swiftly enough to capitalize on opportunities that will dry up as the 
regional economy improves. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreclosure market for apartment houses took off locally in 1991 and is 
expected to get another boost this year as owners walk away from 
earthquake-damaged buildings. Real estate professionals vary in their estimates 
of how long the boom will last, with some saying six months and others two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, speculators, ranging from out-of-state "vultures" to mom-and-pop 
investors, are vying for bargains. Where lenders once had four or five offers 
on an apartment house, they say they now have 10. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be good for lenders, but it may not be healthy for neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too often those who have the cash are speculators who don't do anything to 
improve the properties," said Alan Fisher, director of the California 
Reinvestment Committee, a nonprofit group that pressures banks to obey a 
federal law that requires them to be sensitive to community needs. "Properties 
that may already be run-down by the time they are taken over by the bank become 
more run-down." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher's group has begun a campaign to convince regulators and banks that 
low-income housing providers should be given more time to compete because it is 
in the community's interest that they acquire these properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Low-income housing providers, the group contends, would be in a position to 
use tax subsidies to maintain buildings and keep rents affordable long after 
the recession ends and rents for existing apartments start to rise. 
</P>
<P>
 But developers of low-income housing, mainly nonprofit organizations, 
typically have to win approval for their projects from a variety of government 
agencies -- a process that takes months. 
</P>
<P>
 Lending institutions say they feel pressure to sell more quickly than that to 
cut losses and please stockholders. They say federal banking regulators also 
push them to get the apartments off their books as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time (a nonprofit developer) gets a decision, we would have passed 
over numerous (other) offers," said David Norton, a senior vice president at 
California Federal Bank in charge of selling property acquired through 
foreclosures. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal regulators have been willing to listen to the pleas of Fisher's group. 
"We've put together a working group of bankers, nonprofit developers and 
community groups to . . . develop solutions," said Leonora Cross, spokeswoman 
for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the section of the Treasury 
Department that regulates national banks. 
</P>
<P>
 But radical change seems unlikely. "I'm not sure what will grow out of that," 
Cross said. Since the savings and loan debacle, she acknowledged, regulators 
have been under pressure to be more conservative than ever in making certain 
that banks are financially sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some nonprofit developers and local governments say they have 
difficulty even learning of the availability of bank-owned properties in their 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would appreciate it if (lenders) would come to us and let us know what 
they have in terms of inventory," said Greg Brown, development specialist in 
the Huntington Beach city administrator's office. "They don't." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles city Housing Department appears to be the only government 
agency attempting to address the problem with a program designed specifically 
to exploit the foreclosure market. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are committed to the idea that this is a golden moment in Los Angeles when 
we can buy affordability without building a building," said Barbara Zeidman, 
the department's assistant general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which was presented for approval to the City Council last week, 
would seek to make low-income housing providers more competitive by speeding 
their access to federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 It would allow developers who have found a property to apply for accelerated 
approval of up to $20,000 per unit in loans of federal funds administered by 
the city. It would also allow developers who know in advance that they will be 
looking for foreclosure properties to pre-qualify for loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can get those funds out there in a hurry, cut down the (City) Council 
review process, shorten all of our (internal) review process, we may be able to 
. . . secure those properties," Housing Department General Manager Gary Squier 
said at a recent public hearing on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 But some developers say that is not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need banks to slow down as well as for the public agencies to speed up," 
said Jack Gardner, director of the Hollywood Community Housing Corp. and one of 
the few nonprofit housing developers who have managed to buy a foreclosed-upon 
apartment house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got the bank to move like molasses and the city to move like lightning," he 
said. When Gardner tried to duplicate his success with another bank, however, 
"they were not even willing to talk to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he later found out the reason for his earlier success. He had been the 
only one interested in buying the apartment house. Rooms for Sale

EARLY BUDGET FAILS TO RESTORE TEACHER PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified School District Supt. Sid Thompson released a preliminary 
$4.2-billion budget Monday that fails to restore any of the 10% of employee pay 
that was cut last year, but for the first time in five years calls for a slight 
increase in funding for education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In presenting the budget, Thompson left open the possibility of budget 
tinkering this summer that could lead to diluting of the salary cuts. He and 
the Board of Education are "committed to pursue options to address the 
restoration of salaries. . . . Salary issues will be addressed through the 
negotiations process in the coming months," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, the school district must submit a preliminary budget by June 
30 to the Los Angeles County Office of Education. The final budget does not 
have to be submitted until Sept. 8, to allow for adjustment after the state 
budget is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Catherine Carey, spokeswoman for the 27,000-member United Teachers-Los Angeles 
union, said Thompson's budget is like a "first offer" to teachers. "It tells us 
what their bargaining position is," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Union President Helen Bernstein said school board members "are lying to us 
when they say that salaries are a priority. They are not looking for money. 
They are looking for a strike." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the board should be engaged in "realistic discussions" on budget 
shifts to make good on its yearlong pledge. The union has hired a private firm 
to examine the district's budget for any funds that could be allocated to 
salary restoration, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget Director Henry Jones said there is virtually no wiggle room in the 
district budget. However, the school board could choose to make painful 
decisions in the next two months to restore salaries through budget cuts or 
layoffs -- two options it has strongly opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will continue to seek additional revenues," Jones said. "With every dime, 
you see the agony that the board goes through in trying to restore salaries. 
They are trying." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the district is seeking to avoid losing $6.7 million in state 
funds because of quake-related enrollment declines. About $5 million in state 
reimbursement may be freed in the next two months because of other quake 
expenditures. About $4 million not committed to special programs has yet to be 
allocated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board could also dip into a fund of about $40 million if it decides that 
employee salaries are more important than some new classroom supplies and 
furniture for next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though you can't see in this document any commitment to salary 
restoration, it is deep in our hearts and we are really going to work on it," 
said school board member Mark Slavkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson's budget proposal adds about $4.3 million for school reform measures, 
including$1.3 million to train parents and teachers involved in the LEARN plan 
and $500,000 to develop new districtwide curriculum standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time in half a decade that we have a budget that has an add 
list," Thompson said. "But in a $4-billion budget it's minuscule." 
</P>
<P>
 The board is expected to approve the tentative budget Monday.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; BRAUDE 
URGES LIMITING BURGLAR ALARM RESPONSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles police would not respond to automated burglar alarms until the 
alarm company or the building occupants verified that the building had been 
broken into under a proposal Monday by Councilman Marvin Braude to crack down 
on false alarm calls that divert police from real crime. 
</P>
<P>
 About 95% of the 161,000 security alarms that Los Angeles police responded to 
last year were false -- triggered by human error, faulty equipment or bad 
weather -- according to police and city officials.The needless responses cost 
about $6 million to $8 million in wasted work hours, police have said. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, approved Monday by the council's Public Safety Committee, was 
criticized by an alarm industry representative, who said the verification 
requirement would substantially increase the cost of alarm systems, putting 
them out of reach for many.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; PROPOSAL 
WOULD EQUIP POOLS FOR FIREFIGHTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed ordinance would require owners of new residential swimming pools in 
Los Angeles to install piping that would allow firefighters to tap the 
miniature reservoirs in an emergency.  
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council's Public Safety Committee asked city attorneys 
Monday to draft such a measure, but Chairman Marvin Braude conceded that the 
full council might not pass it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can afford to buy a home and build a swimming pool, the question is, 
should you be required to contribute to the public safety of your neighborhood 
by having the pool water available for firefighting purposes?" Braude said. 
"That's the moral question."  
</P>
<P>
 Braude made the proposal last year after brush fires devastated Malibu, Laguna 
Beach and Altadena. The disaster highlighted the tinderbox vulnerability of 
hillside areas to loss of water pressure.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COLISEUM 
PANEL TO MEET TODAY ON RAIDERS DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission has called a closed session at 4 
p.m. today to discuss the terms of a deal that would keep the Raiders football 
team playing in the facility this fall when $42 million in earthquake repairs 
are nearly complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Coliseum nor Raider officials returned calls seeking details of the 
proposed agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission has reportedly been under pressure to agree to free rent or 
other cash concessions to the Raiders, who have an offer from the 
Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum to return to the Bay Area to play this fall, at 
least for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 One member of the commission, County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who is not on 
the commission's negotiating committee, said he had not been told what was in 
the proposed agreement, but is skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Raiders are looking for free rent or 100% of the concessions revenue, 
what will they want next year?" Antonovich asked.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CASTAIC; TRUCK WITH 
REMAINS INSIDE BELONGED TO MURDER SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The wreckage of a pickup truck found in a deep ravine near Castaic -- and 
possibly the human remains inside the truck -- belonged to the suspect in a 
1993 San Fernando Valley murder, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 18 months ago, Christ James Wetzel, 27, was fatally shot in the garage 
of a Northridge house by his friend, Mark Douglas Snyder, according to 
police.Witnesses said that after the shooting Snyder drove off in a green 
pickup. He was never seen again. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police detectives confirmed Monday that the truck spotted last 
weekend by forest rangers off the Templin Highway was the one Snyder fled in. 
Still unconfirmed are whether the skeletal remains in and around the truck are 
Snyder's, and if so, how he died. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they were working with Snyder's sister to obtain dental records 
and a spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner's office said an 
anthropologist will examine the bones within the next week in an effort to 
positively identify them and determine the cause of death.

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; HOSPICE CARE REWARDS 
GIVERS AND RECEIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Edward Poindexter of Woodland Hills first met death in the form of shrapnel 
and bullets on the battlefields of Europe during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never get accustomed to it," said Poindexter, who now helps terminally 
ill patients and their families face death as a volunteer with the Hospice of 
the Canyon in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was always that thought in your mind of fear. There could always be a 
round coming over with your name on it," said Poindexter, remembering his 
experiences as a U.S. Army sergeant during the fighting in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have accepted a long time ago that all of us will meet this fate sooner or 
later," added Poindexter, 73, who has been visiting terminally ill patients in 
their homes for two years.  
</P>
<P>
 But his most recent experience with death has been very different from his 
wartime experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospice patients may take months to die. It is during those months that some 
extraordinary things can happen between the volunteers and their patients and 
their families, said Patricia Nolan, director of volunteer services for the 
Hospice of the Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members may resolve old arguments and form enduring friendships with 
volunteers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Nolan said, one volunteer became a close friend of a woman whose 
husband was dying, and even helped shop for a shirt and tie so he would have 
something in which to be buried. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of hospice work is to allow terminally ill patients to die at home in 
familiar surroundings, rather than in a cold and impersonal hospital. And the 
work of the home-care volunteer is to give the patient's family members a break 
from the constant care giving. 
</P>
<P>
 Often the volunteers go far beyond the expected, Nolan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I swear to God, some of these people walk in the doors and they have wings on 
their backs," said Nolan, who herself started as a hospice volunteer 16 years 
ago.  
</P>
<P>
 In her earlier experience, Nolan experienced an emotional burnout. As a 
result, when Nolan took over the volunteer program at Hospice of the Canyon, 
she set up an intensive 10-week training course to help prepare the volunteers 
to work with terminally ill patients. The hospice also runs support groups to 
help volunteers cope with the pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them all, they may have wondered why they are here; what's the meaning 
of life," said Nolan, explaining the philosophy she gives to volunteers. "I 
always tell them that despite everything else, maybe the only reason you were 
put on this earth is to touch one person's life and they may meet them here." 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Ahearn of Woodland Hills, a hospice volunteer for two years, said she 
has gotten a lot more from the patients than she has given. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're fantastic teachers," said Ahearn, a mother of eight who sometimes 
takes children with her on the visits. "I think as they deal with a terminal 
illness, they show you a side of humanity you never get to see."  
</P>
<P>
 After a patient has died, Ahearn goes through a period of mourning, and has to 
take a few weeks off from the volunteer work to recover. One patient who faced 
death with such a zest for life meant a lot to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told me that it was a real gift to her that she was able to get to know 
me," Ahearn said. "I thought it was a really incredible thing to say because 
she was such a gift to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman died with her family around her, but only after waiting for Ahearn 
to get there so they could say goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hospice of the Canyon is looking for volunteers to become community 
service speakers, help in the hospice office and work at its gift shop. Hours 
are flexible. Applications from patient care volunteers are being accepted for 
training classes starting in September. For more information call Nolan at 
818-591-1459. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Language Preparedness School at the Salvation Army in Burbank 
needs tutors to help adult students learn to speak, read and write in English. 
To volunteer call the Salvation Army at 818-845-7215 and ask for Kim Rhodes or 
Krystyna Hackett. A training meeting is scheduled for June 30. The summer 
tutoring session begins July 5.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
GANG DEATHS FALL, POVERTY ON RISE, UNITED WAY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Juvenile arrests and gang-related deaths have decreased in the county, but 
poverty is affecting more children than ever, the local United Way said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a "state of the county" report, the United Way of Greater Los Angeles said 
that youths in the county, the nation's most populous with more than 9.2 
million residents, are likelier to be victims than perpetrators.It said 
gang-related deaths, which peaked at 800 in 1992, fell to 719 in 1993 -- down 
10% and the first decline in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Way report drew on Census Bureau data, information from other 
government agencies and many specialized reports. It is the third county 
snapshot complied since 1987 by the regional group, which raises money for more 
than 300 service agencies, mostly from individuals at work. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Way report said that children's health care is improving, with 
better prenatal care, insurance and immunization. The infant death rate is 
falling while graduation rates are rising. 
</P>
<P>
 "But in terms of economic well-being all the measures are worse," said 
Marjorie Nichols, director of research projects for the group. "Children are 
most affected by poverty of any age group and it's been getting worse and 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
 The number of children below the poverty level and on Aid to Families With 
Dependent Children, the biggest federal welfare program, has risen sharply. In 
1988, 16% of children were on AFDC. By 1992, the latest year for which figures 
are available, it was 24%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homelessness among children has increased too," Nichols said. "Two percent of 
the children in the county were homeless sometime in 1992, compared with 1% of 
adults."

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: VALLEY HOSTS SOUGHT FOR FOREIGN STUDENTS

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A program that finds homes for teen-age foreign exchange students is looking 
for host families in the San Fernando Valley area. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are here to learn how to be an American teen-ager," said Kathleen 
Keever, the California regional director for the Academic Year in American 
program, which brings 2,000 students from more than 20 countries to the United 
States each year. 
</P>
<P>
 The students are 15 to 18 years old, and spend either a school year or 
semester with their host families. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time they leave, they feel they really have a second family," Keever 
said. "About 80 to 100 of the students are placed in California, including the 
Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids who come over here are timid and shy at first. It's a big jump for 
them to leave their home countries," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those interested in being a host family can call Keever at (800) 458-7100. ED

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: ARLETA; BASEBALL LEAGUE FOR YOUTHS SEEKS COACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A baseball league that mixes hearing and hearing-impaired youngsters in Arleta 
is seeking volunteers to help coach the team, as well as players to fill the 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mainstream Sports League, which offers Tee-Ball games, is also offering 
free sign-language lessons for parents whose children register for the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration will be held daily from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. through Saturday at 
Branford Recreation Center, 13306 Branford Ave., Arleta. The league is open to 
boys and girls between 5 and 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of people who don't know about the league," said Sylvia 
Rodriguez, 37, of San Fernando, who helped start the organization last year for 
players such as her 6-year-old son, David, who is deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 The league helps build self-esteem in youths who are hearing-impaired by 
mainstreaming them with players who can hear. Rodriguez said the league also 
teaches hearing children how to become comfortable with the hearing-impaired. 
Practice will be at 11 a.m. Saturdays.  
</P>
<P>
 For further information about the league, contact Rodriguez at (818) 361-0035. 
The number also receives calls from Telephone Devices for the Deaf, or TDDs. 
Spanish-speaking families should call (818) 764-9291. JEFF SCHNAUFER

 As many as 700 families will qualify for loans to purchase and renovate homes 
in low-and middle-income neighborhoods in Los Angeles under a program announced 
Monday by city and federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The $100-million Home Works! mortgage program by the Federal Home Loan 
Mortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac, is designed to help first-time home buyers 
obtain and improve homes in depressed neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will allow home buyers to finance up to 95% of the purchase of a 
home and to borrow additional funds from the city's Housing Department to make 
repairs. The rehabilitation loans will be interest-free and will not be due 
until the owner sells the home. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the favorable terms will encourage stable families to move 
into marginal neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Owning your own home is part of the American dream and provides stability to 
Los Angeles' diverse neighborhoods," Mayor Richard Riordan said as he stood in 
front of a home in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Countrywide Funding Corp., First Interstate Bank and Family Savings Bank -- a 
local black-owned institution -- will originate and underwrite the loans.

KOREAN SUMMIT EXPECTATIONS MIXED; FOREIGN POLICY: KOREAN AMERICANS IN LOS 
ANGELES DRAW SOME HOPE FROM JIMMY CARTER'S EFFORT TO DEFUSE NUCLEAR DANGER, BUT 
MANY REMAIN CONCERNED. 
</P>

 Korean Americans in Los Angeles reacted with a range of emotions Monday to 
former President Jimmy Carter's meeting with North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, 
and the announcement over the weekend that the heads of South Korea and North 
Korea will hold a summit meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 To Steve SungGill Chang, president of the Korean-American Federation of Los 
Angeles, the latest development was a welcome respite from months of worrying 
about his homeland because of the standoff between the United States and North 
Korea over Pyongyang's suspected efforts to build a nuclear weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I can take a little breather now," said Chang, a native of South 
Korea. "I don't trust Kim Il Sung, but I'd like to hope that Carter's visit has 
opened a way to begin a dialogue between Kim Il Sung and (South Korean 
President) Kim Young Sam." 
</P>
<P>
 But to Bong Keon Kim, president of the Los Angeles-based U.S. Federation of 
Korean Americans From Northern Korea, it is naive to believe that Carter's 
efforts or the planned summit of the two leaders will resolve tensions on the 
Korean peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Kim Il Sung's ploy to buy time," said the federation's Kim. He said 
the Clinton Administration should push the United Nations to seek economic 
sanctions against North Korea as punishment for being an international outlaw. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, President Clinton, distancing himself from Carter, said the North 
Korean leader should demonstrate his intentions with action, not words. 
</P>
<P>
 Since late last year, when tensions over Pyongyang's nuclear program erupted 
anew, Koreans in Los Angeles have worried about their homeland and family 
members still there. An estimated 400,000 people of Korean ancestry live in 
Southern California -- nearly half in Los Angeles -- the largest Korean 
community outside Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, after North Korea threatened to pull out of the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty, 32 Los Angeles-based Korean American civic, business, 
legal, religious and community organizations formed the Committee for Peace in 
Korea to offer Korean American perspectives to U.S. policy makers and the news 
media. 
</P>
<P>
 "Korean Americans have no say in U.S. foreign policy (involving Korea) even 
though we are affected by it," said Charles Kim, a member of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been difficult for the Committee for Peace in Korea to make itself 
known to the mainstream. Its inaugural news conference last Friday in Koreatown 
was canceled because all but one reporter from the mainstream media left after 
learning about a press conference regarding O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess O.J. Simpson and the World Cup are more important to the news media 
than the fate of more than 70 million Koreans," said Charles Kim. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee rescheduled the conference for Monday morning, only to cancel it 
again when it learned that Simpson would be arraigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang, a member of the National Democratic Committee's Business Leadership 
Forum, had planned to hand-deliver the group's "urgent plea" about Korea to 
President Clinton during a White House reception tonight. But he chose to wait 
on the letter until he can introduce the committee to the Los Angeles media. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, during the committee's news conference with Korean-speaking 
reporters, committee members said their plea urged Clinton, the presidents of 
North and South Korea and other world leaders to find a means to resolve the 
conflict peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "We represent the collective sentiments of over 1 million Korean Americans 
nationwide," said Jerry Yu, executive director of the Korean American 
Coalition. "We are apprehensive that the current path of U.S. foreign policy 
toward North Korea could once again bring war to Korea." 
</P>
<P>
 Yu said Monday the weekend developments have not altered his view of U.S. 
foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Kim contends that the Korean peninsula remains divided because of 
myopic U.S. policy. "To think that Korea is the only country still divided in 
the post-Cold War era is sad," he said. "It's a shame that we have (1.5 
million) soldiers facing each other -- ready to shoot."

BUDGET CAN'T COVER POLICE RAISE, OFFICIALS FEAR; FINANCES: WARNING THAT SOME 
REVENUE SOURCES WON'T COME THROUGH, TWO CITY COUNCIL PANELS URGE THAT 
CONSIDERATION OF A PAY PACKAGE FOR OFFICERS BE POSTPONED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Several city officials cast doubt Monday on a city budget they approved less 
than two weeks ago, saying revenue shortfalls will make it impossible to both 
give police a proposed raise and continue increasing police patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 Two City Council committees recommended that the full council postpone 
consideration of a pay raise package for police until shortfalls in revenues 
have been more clearly defined. 
</P>
<P>
 The police pay package -- with a base increase of 7%, topped by bonuses 
totaling as much as 5% -- is scheduled for ratification votes by the police 
union beginning today and continuing until Thursday. If it is approved, the 
council is expected to take up the package at its Friday meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of the 15-member council appears to favor the contract to end the 
2-year-old labor dispute. But a vocal minority -- including members of the 
Public Safety and Budget and Finance committees, which voted Monday -- is 
working hard to defeat the proposal, saying it is too expensive for the 
financially strapped city. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the raise held a hearing Friday at which several department heads 
cast doubt on the city treasury receiving an additional $100 million that was 
part of Mayor Richard Riordan's budget. The budget was approved by the council 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Miyoshi, head of the Department of Water and Power, said he could 
guarantee only about half of the $75-million special appropriation that the DWP 
had earlier pledged. As much as $37 million of the transfer is in doubt because 
the DWP is uncertain that it can sell surplus land, as it had previously 
proposed, Miyoshi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city may also lose $25 million that officials had anticipated because 
state officials are expected to reduce funding from motor vehicle licensing, 
the city's chief legislative analyst said. Special transfers from the Harbor 
and Airport departments, totaling $15 million, were also questioned, because of 
state and federal laws that limit use of those funds. And the city's Community 
Redevelopment Agency warned that its pledge to pick up $25 million in city 
expenses could be hampered by legal limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's now clear that some of the revenue estimates in the mayor's budget were 
far too optimistic," said Councilman Marvin Braude, who earlier this month had 
been one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan conceded last week that some of the money for the police raises might 
have to be taken from his plan to put more police on the street. But Riordan 
said he was hopeful that ingenuity could head off reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said $27 million that had been set aside for police 
overtime will not be available in the coming year because a contribution from a 
city pension system fell through, and a special contract to collect more 
parking tickets will not be in place until next year. Another $10 million will 
be needed from overtime accounts to pay higher salaries, Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using those assumptions, Police Department financial officers said the 
equivalent of 577 police officers could not be put on the street as planned in 
the mayor's Project Safety Los Angeles. That would amount to a reduction of 
more than one-third from the 1,522 additional officers Riordan has pledged.

LAWYER DENIES ETHICAL BREACH; COURTS: BRIEF FILED BY STEPHEN YAGMAN SAYS HE 
COMMITTED NO VIOLATION IN STRONGLY CRITICIZING A JUDGE. A DISCIPLINARY PANEL 
HAS URGED HIS SUSPENSION FOR 15 MONTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Venice civil rights lawyer Stephen Yagman contends that he violated no canon 
of ethics and should not be sanctioned for his withering criticism of U.S. 
District Judge William D. Keller, whom he accused of being anti-Semitic, drunk 
on the bench, "ignorant, dishonest . . . a bully and one of the worst judges in 
the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman took this position on his comments in a brief filed in Los Angeles 
federal court that became available Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial attorney was responding to a May ruling of a special panel 
of three Los Angeles federal judges, who said he "impugned the integrity of the 
court" when he made the accusations against their colleague Keller. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges also ruled that Yagman engaged in judge shopping. They said he 
criticized Keller in an effort to force Keller to remove himself from trying 
Yagman's cases, most of which allege use of excessive force by police officers. 
Keller, a former U.S. attorney and a 1984 appointee of President Ronald Reagan, 
is generally viewed as sympathetic to law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling by the three-judge panel -- John G. Davies, Edward Rafeedie and 
David W. Williams -- was in response to action of a special disciplinary 
committee of the Los Angeles federal court, which filed charges against Yagman 
in late 1992 after Keller lodged a complaint. Earlier this month, the committee 
recommended that Yagman be suspended from practicing in federal court in the 
Central District of California -- a seven-county area stretching from Riverside 
to San Luis Obispo -- for 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
 In his brief, Yagman responded that the charges against him are "based 
entirely on speech involving criticism of a judge, which could have no effects 
on rights in litigation, and (on) private comments" he made to a judicial 
publication.  
</P>
<P>
 Expression in those forums is "important to public awareness, judgment and 
confidence in the judiciary in a free society . . . and should be protected 
from the chilling effect of punishment for its exercise," said the brief, 
written by Yagman's attorney, Ramsey Clark of New York, a former U.S. attorney 
general. 
</P>
<P>
 In their May ruling, the three judges cited as evidence statements Yagman made 
to a reporter from the Los Angeles Daily Journal, a legal trade paper; a letter 
he wrote to Prentice Hall, the publisher of a book of judicial profiles; an 
advertisement Yagman placed in the Daily Journal seeking information from 
lawyers whom Keller had sanctioned, and testimony of Robert K. Steinberg, a 
West Los Angeles attorney. Steinberg said Yagman told him he had criticized 
Keller in an attempt to force Keller off his cases, a charge Yagman denies. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges ruled that there is no evidence Keller is anti-Semitic or that 
Yagman "had a reasonable basis for making such accusations." They also ruled 
that Yagman "has made no efforts to explain his accusations that Judge Keller 
is dishonest or 'drunk on the bench.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Yagman's attorneys contend he "did not make false or defamatory 
statements and there is no basis in the record for a finding to the contrary." 
The brief contends that judge-shopping was "alleged but not proven."  
</P>
<P>
 The current controversy started when Yagman sought to have another federal 
judge, Manuel L. Real, recused -- taken off -- a case Yagman had filed against 
an insurance company. Keller rejected Yagman's recusal motion in a decision in 
which he accused the attorney of "deceit," "bad faith" and "actual intent to 
mislead the court." 
</P>
<P>
 USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky, who specializes in constitutional law and 
legal ethics, agreed with the two major contentions in Yagman's brief on the 
recusal and 1st Amendment issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the United States, criticizing government institutions, even harshly, is 
protected by the 1st Amendment," Chemerinsky said. "There is no crime of 
seditious libel in this country. People can't be punished civilly or criminally 
for criticizing the government, and this brief rightly makes that point." 
</P>
<P>
 In its original decision, the three-judge panel said a court could impose 
greater restrictions on a lawyer's speech than it could on other citizens since 
they are "officers of the court." That conclusion, among others, is expected to 
be the subject of an appeal by Yagman after the panel makes a decision on what 
sanction -- if any -- it will impose on him.

FIRMS WORK ON PLAY CENTERS; CHILDREN: JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN N.J. OPERATOR AND 
IRVINE'S UNITED LEISURE CALLS FOR FIRST ONE TO OPEN IN SOUTH COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A New Jersey company that operates martial arts training centers said Monday 
it has a pact with the former operator of the Lion Country Safari theme park in 
Orange County to start a chain of children's play and learning centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint venture between Master Glazier Karate International Inc. of 
Elizabeth, N.J., and United Leisure Corp. in Irvine will result in opening of 
two centers in Orange County within six months, followed by others in Southern 
California and the East. 
</P>
<P>
 United Leisure Chairman Harry Shuster would not put a value on the joint 
venture except to say that millions of dollars will be spent and that United 
Leisure and Master Glazier will contribute equally. In California, he said, the 
venture will open its first center in south Orange County, followed by another 
in north Orange County. Specific sites have not yet been chosen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuster said United Leisure's move into the children's play business is 
prompted by the fact that the company will lose its lease on 300 acres of land 
owned by the Irvine Co. in 1997. United Leisure subleases to the operators of 
Irvine Meadows Amphitheater and the Wild Rivers water park on that property. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing the lease necessitates finding other lines of business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same site, United Leisure has operated Camp Frazier, a summer day camp 
for children, since 1982. With 600 campers and 150 employees, that facility is 
one of the largest of its kind, Shuster said. 
</P>
<P>
 The learning centers, he said, will give United Leisure an opportunity to 
apply the experience it has gained with Camp Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
 Play centers are a fast-growing industry. Chicago-based Discovery Zone Inc., 
one of the leaders, has more than doubled in size in the past two years and now 
has 215 centers, 21 of which are in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The centers generally charge youngsters a flat fee -- parents get in free -- 
to use the indoor play equipment and games of skill. Parents can drop off their 
children if they want, but "we encourage interaction between parents and 
children," a Discovery Zone spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuster said he wants to include computer learning stations in his chain of 
centers, yet to be named. Each of his centers will likely be in so-called 
"power center" clusters of discount stores, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Glazier, president of Master Glazier, said, "United Leisure has been 
successful at entertaining children at its summer camp, and we have 
demonstrated our ability to teach children discipline and self-confidence 
through martial arts. . . . Coupled with the meteoric growth of play center 
facilities, we are confident that our experience in these areas will enable us 
to establish a strong foothold."

LOW-COST BUILDER PLANS SHIFT TO UPSCALE HOMES FOR O.C. SITE; LOCATION: 
CONSTRUCTION GIANT KNOWN FOR NO-FRILLS HOUSING WILL BUILD 144 OF ITS MOST 
EXPENSIVE HOUSES ON 37 ACRES AT DANA POINT. 
</P>

<P>
 Kaufman & Broad, which became the largest home builder in the West by offering 
low-cost, no-frills homes in inland areas across California, is moving to the 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
 On 37 acres in Dana Point, the Los Angeles-based builder plans to construct 
its most expensive homes yet, several of which will feature views of the 
Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices will start at about $250,000, although houses with the best ocean 
vistas will cost nearly $400,000. That's expensive for Kaufman & Broad, whose 
average home price in California is $162,100. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the 144 homes in the company's California Cortina project are 
modestly priced compared to the multimillion-dollar mansions that typically sit 
on similar coastal lots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're selling homes with ocean views to the heartland of America," said 
Roland Osgood, president of Kaufman & Broad in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Webb, president of Greystone Homes in Newport Beach and a former 
president at Kaufman & Broad, predicted that the project will be a success. 
"Those prices aren't scary at all for Orange County," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Osgood said the Dana Point project is a variation on Kaufman & Broad's 
established business theme, rather than an indication of a whole new strategy. 
The builder has tried unsuccessfully in the past to break into the so-called 
move-up market -- selling consumers more costly second or third homes. But it 
never succeeded in convincing buyers that it could compete with builders known 
for luxury homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a formula that they live by, and that formula is entry-level 
homes," said John Shumway, president of Market Profiles, a real estate 
consulting firm in Costa Mesa. "They make a well-designed product and market it 
to the hilt. It's like McDonald's. They are a production line builder, but they 
do it with a lot of merchandising savvy." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Kaufman & Broad successfully survived the real estate downturn by 
sticking to what it does best: offering entry-level homes. The company built 
5,952 homes nationwide last year to post revenue of $1.24 billion, up 13% from 
$1.09 billion for 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dana Point homes will have three or four bedrooms and will range in size 
from 1,591 to 1,953 square feet. The Mediterranean-style project will be in the 
gated community of Monarch Beach at the northwest corner of Niguel Road and 
Corniche Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivy Schneider, a housing analyst with the brokerage Salomon Brothers in New 
York, hailed the venture as a wise move by Kaufman & Broad, which she follows 
closely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I view this as a good opportunity for the company," she said, "though I 
wouldn't necessarily view a major push toward the high-end housing market as 
necessarily beneficial for them at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman & Broad's Osgood, who has been involved in the Southland home building 
industry since 1968, is betting that the venture will succeed not only because 
of the ocean view but also because of the little extras. The homes will have 
features not typically found in their price range: better appliances, glass 
insets in wood-paneled garage doors, double-pane windows, large back porches. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Ford works, and a Rolls Royce works. These homes will be the Rolls Royce of 
Kaufman & Broad but not of the entire industry," Osgood said. "We're just 
taking reservations, we have about 30 people now who are looking at lots, so we 
think this will be very successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Confident of its success, the company bid aggressively for the lots, which it 
purchased this year from San Diego developer R.B. McComic Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in neighboring areas did not have the same faith, however, and 
raised questions at Dana Point Planning Commission meetings about the quality 
and features of the houses being planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "The homeowners were real concerned about compatibility of the new homes with 
their current dwellings, but Kaufman & Broad was receptive to those concerns 
and made some design changes, such as the style of the garage doors," said John 
Sherwood, assistant planner for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Among details on which Kaufman & Broad architects negotiated were colors for 
exterior walls and roof tiles. On April 6, the planning commission gave final 
approval for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The homeowners were disappointed that the product we live in was not 
continued, but we were successful in getting them to include features that we 
think keep the neighborhood looking harmonious," said Frank Alvarez, president 
of the homeowners association in neighboring Corniche Sur Mer. "We wanted to 
minimize the differences so property values would be maintained." California

HUGHES MAY CUT 3,400 JOBS OVER 2 YEARS; AEROSPACE: EL SEGUNDO AND FULLERTON 
FACILITIES ARE TARGETED. COMPANY SAYS IT MUST GET AS LEAN AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER 
TO COMPETE.

<P>
 Hughes Aerospace & Electronics said Monday that it plans to cut perhaps 3,400 
jobs -- most of them in Southern California -- over the next two years as part 
of a previously announced consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based aerospace company plans to eliminate jobs at its 
military electronics and systems plants in El Segundo and Fullerton as well as 
at its missiles systems operation in Tucson, according to company spokesman 
Richard Dore. 
</P>
<P>
 Those three Hughes operations have already been cut heavily, Dore said, adding 
that most of the 13,000 jobs eliminated by parent Hughes Aircraft since 1992 
have been in those units. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hughes spokesman said the company has not determined how many jobs will be 
lost at each location, but Southern California, which has been battered for 
several years by deep cuts in the aerospace and defense industries, will 
probably feel most of the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our employment is in Southern California," Dore acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 The company will not know exactly how many jobs will be lost until July or 
August, when several company task forces are expected to deliver their 
recommendations on streamlining operations. 
</P>

 Hughes Aircraft raised the prospect of plant closings in May as part of the 
consolidation of its defense operations into a new Washington-based subsidiary, 
Hughes Aerospace & Electronics, with 34,000 workers. But at the time, the 
company did not quantify the number of job losses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of shrinking defense budgets, Hughes has no choice but to cut jobs 
and costs to remain competitive for the remaining contracts, Dore said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Companies are going to have to get as lean as they possibly can to give the 
highest level of quality at the lowest price possible . . . because price will 
be the driving factor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes, which is the largest industrial employer in California, has a total 
work force of 50,000.

DECISION WON'T SPEAK TO ALL FIRMS; WORKPLACE: IMPACT OF SUPREME COURT'S ACTION 
ON AN ENGLISH-ONLY CASE IS EXPECTED TO BE BLUNTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Back in the late 1980s, Tony Wong got into a dispute with his bosses at a Los 
Angeles insurance firm because he liked to speak Cantonese with co-workers who 
also spoke the language. 
</P>
<P>
 The company eventually imposed an "English-only" rule in his department, Wong 
said, because management apparently was "paranoid" that employees speaking in 
foreign languages were talking about them. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, however, the foreign language skills Wong acquired while growing up in 
the San Francisco area are a major plus. He just started working for a job 
placement firm where he expects to recruit Cantonese-speaking engineers and 
computer scientists. He also uses his Cantonese frequently while working part 
time for a telemarketing firm serving customers with ties to China, Hong Kong 
and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 The business advantages of employing people who speak two or more languages 
are expected to blunt the impact of a U.S. Supreme Court decision Monday that 
backs employers' rights to impose English-only rules in the workplace. 
Particularly in immigrant-rich parts of the country, such as Southern 
California, the benefits are substantial in having employees who can train new 
hires or greet customers in their native language. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're serving the public, it's really needed," said Gail Jordan, a job 
placement specialist with the Verdugo Center for Jobs and Retraining in 
Burbank. She said Southern California employers are increasingly seeking 
bilingual workers, particularly those who speak Spanish, for jobs in areas such 
as personnel and customer service. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, there are also strong state legal restrictions on English-only 
rules -- despite recent concerns about "immigrant bashing" and a ballot 
proposition that made English the official language of California in 1986. To 
impose English-only rules, employers under state law still must demonstrate 
that there is a "business necessity" for such action. 
</P>
<P>
 Irma Rodriguez, a lawyer in the language rights program of the Mexican 
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, expressed concern that the Supreme 
Court's decision might make employers feel that "now it's OK" to adopt 
English-only rules. Still, she said, such requirements currently "aren't on the 
increase in any sector" of the California economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Monday's decision could foster further discrimination in other states 
against workers who have limited English skills, warned Kathryn Imahara, 
director of the language rights project with the Asian Pacific American Legal 
Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in California, Imahara said, many employers place too little value on 
knowledge of foreign languages. "The companies value the bilingual person only 
so long as it increases market share or has other marketing advantages," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At many of these companies, she said, "you can't then turn around and speak 
Spanish to your co-workers." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in California, English-only rules have come mainly in such fields as 
manufacturing and health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas R. Luevano, vice president of the 450-member California Assn. of 
Hospitals and Health Systems, said such policies are common at hospitals in 
urban areas with large numbers of immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the rules are mostly intended to protect the safety of patients and 
employees. He cited a hypothetical example of an ailing patient overhearing two 
nurses speaking an unfamiliar language. 
</P>
<P>
 "The patients' anxiety level increases at a time when they don't need that," 
Luevano said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the use of foreign languages can also be a source of tension 
between hospital employees. "If morale is suffering and employees are looking 
to point fingers at the reason why . . . language often comes up as an issue," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, Luevano said, many of the hospitals in his organization 
discourage the use of languages other than English, even during employees' 
break periods. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Rodriguez contends that English-only rules tend to be imposed at 
workplaces where there are underlying racial tensions, and she said such 
problems "can be better addressed by other means." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Luevano acknowledged that the ability to speak foreign languages 
is essential for many hospital admissions and emergency room employees, among 
others. In fact, hospitals are required under federal and state law to provide 
interpreters, when necessary, to communicate with patients.

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: PEACE, LOVE AND PROFITS; WOODSTOCK '94 A FESTIVAL 
OF MARKETING AND MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a safe bet that Woodstock '94 may get more ink in the Wall Street Journal 
than in Rolling Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 And deservedly so. 
</P>
<P>
 If ever a rock festival was made to order for the consumption of corporate 
America, this is it. A slew of upcoming Pepsi ads will try to make the 
Woodstock Generation synonymous with the Pepsi Generation. The soft drink giant 
isn't just sponsoring Woodstock, it's printing the "official" Woodstock 
Guidebook -- all 10 million of them. Haagen-Dazs will be churning out the 
official ice cream. MCI is expected to emerge as the official long-distance 
phone company. 
</P>
<P>
 And since this is the '90s, there's even going to be an officially licensed 
Woodstock condom. In a rainbow of colors, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 When Woodstock '94 takes place Aug. 13 and 14 in Saugerties, N.Y., about 50 
miles from the site of the 1969 music festival, it will not be merely a 
nostalgic gathering aimed at bringing the baby boomers out of their condos. 
Sure, some of the original performers such as Santana and Joe Cocker will show 
up, but the addition of contemporary rock bands, including Alice in Chains and 
Nine Inch Nails, is a clear attempt to appeal to today's younger crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival of music and peace that wanted to change the world 25 years ago 
has itself been changed in 1994 by the marketing world. Tickets are $135 each 
-- plus service charge. If you can't make the trek, you can always plunk down 
$49 and watch the pay-per-view on cable TV. Or you can watch the movie. Or the 
CD. No word yet about the video game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back in the 1960s, there was some small sphere of our lives that was still 
outside the marketplace -- and that's what Woodstock was all about," said Sut 
Jhally, professor of communications at the University of Massachusetts at 
Amherst. "But the marketplace seems to have triumphed over everything, 
including Woodstock." 
</P>
<P>
 A far cry this is from the first Woodstock -- to which many people hitchhiked. 
Travel packages to Woodstock '94 are being booked through a toll-free number -- 
including a $799 package from Los Angeles that includes air fare, 
accommodations and bus service. And while word of mouth was mostly the way the 
first festival was promoted, a multimedia ad campaign promoting Woodstock '94 
-- including a glitzy network TV ad -- is scheduled to break Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad, which features Generation X-ers on the road to Woodstock, is aimed at 
youth. Instead of Crosby, Stills and Nash, the ad features music from the Sex 
Pistols. The ad satirizes one baby boomer who calls Woodstock '94 "a spiritual 
gathering." The ad ends with the slogan: "Now it's your turn. It isn't like 
Woodstock, it is Woodstock." 
</P>
<P>
 The ad was created by New York ad man Jeff Weiss, 40, who turned thumbs down 
to ads dripping with nostalgia. "The creative thrust is: We recognize our 
heritage, but this is a Woodstock for 1994," said Weiss, a former Los Angeles 
resident. "Woodstock is still about peace and love and music, but with a little 
bit of punk thrown in." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the promotion, Woodstock '94 producers insist they have not sold 
out to the materialistic values that many Woodstock performers opposed 25 years 
ago. "We're not out to make a killing or a fortune," said Joel Rosenman, 51, 
president of Woodstock Ventures, who co-produced the first Woodstock. "And 
since we will only have sponsors who share our concerns for the environment, we 
do not expect the list will be long." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodstock executives are still negotiating with a number of potential 
sponsors. Besides Pepsi, Haagen-Dazs and the others, the East Coast music store 
chain Nobody Beats the Wiz is expected to announce that it will have special 
Woodstock kiosks at the event and in some stores. Negotiations are also taking 
place with an airline, a guitar maker and a fruit juice company. 
</P>
<P>
 One happy note: There will be no corporate signage on the stage. But just 
about everything else is fair game. Pepsi, for example, has dibs on food court 
signage. 
</P>
<P>
 No single sponsor will be more closely linked to Woodstock '94 than Pepsi. Its 
name will appear on most festival advertising, and the slogan "Live It. Love 
Pepsi" will flash across TV screens on ads to promote Woodstock '94 ticket 
sales. Pepsi is even sponsoring a national "Battle of the Bands" contest, with 
the winner to perform at Woodstock '94. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music is the language of youth, and we want to be a part of that 
conversation," said Amy Sherwood, a Pepsi spokeswoman. "Our strategy is to 
bring the music of today to as many people as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly that's what executives at Atlantic Records have in mind. The 
company, which produced the original, best-selling Woodstock album, now plans 
to re-release the music -- along with other music from Woodstock -- in a set of 
four CDs that will retail for about $50. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a memento of that time," said Val Azzoli, general manager at Atlantic. 
"To anyone who asks whether we're cashing in, I say, 'How can it be that we're 
cashing in if people want to buy it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Bros. has remade the original Woodstock movie -- with new footage -- 
and will re-release a four-hour version of the Academy Award-winning film June 
29 in Los Angeles and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the original festival, which was put together with little strategic 
planning, Woodstock '94 is receiving detailed logistic and financial help from 
a division of PolyGram Holding Inc., the global music and entertainment firm. 
In fact, PolyGram is a full partner in Woodstock '94. 
</P>
<P>
 Few stones on the road to Woodstock '94 have been left unturned. 
</P>
<P>
 At last week's annual product licensing convention in New York, there was 
considerable interest in festival products, said Karen Raugust, editor of the 
Licensing Letter. A number of Woodstock '94 products have been licensed, 
including key chains, glassware and removable tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Woodstock '94 "Peace Condoms" -- complete with the Woodstock logo 
-- will hit the market soon for $1.49, said Davin Wedel, president of Global 
Protection Corp., a licensee. "It is designed to play up the free-spiritedness 
of Woodstock," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But experts in marketing to the under-30 set say that while Woodstock '94 will 
probably be a mammoth media event -- and an extremely lucrative concert -- it 
won't necessarily be a huge hit with young people.  
</P>
<P>
 "Kids think of Woodstock as something queer and goofy that their parents did," 
said Marian Salzman, president of New York-based BKG Youth. "It's an historical 
disconnect." 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, many younger people simply can't afford to go, said Irma Zandl, 
president of New York-based Zandl Group. "They view it as a major rip-off," she 
said.

COMPANY TOWN; MOVE OVER SEGA -- HERE COME THE CONGLOMERATES; MULTIMEDIA: BIG 
GUYS DOMINATE THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SHOW FOR THE FIRST TIME, AT THE EXPENSE 
OF THE INDEPENDENT VIDEO GAME PUBLISHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Guess who's coming to the Consumer Electronics Show this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Not video game veteran Sega of America, for one. Nor Electronic Arts, the 
nation's biggest independent publisher of interactive games. Several small game 
developers caught in a cash crunch also won't be exhibiting this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the show in Chicago -- where dozens of video game publishers and 
other electronics manufacturers gather annually to titillate retailers, 
customers and the media with previews of their Christmas season wares -- will 
for the first time be dominated by entertainment companies such as 20th Century 
Fox, Walt Disney Co., MCA/Universal and the many-tentacled Viacom Inc. when it 
opens Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 The shift in the show's character may reflect a changing balance of power in 
the multimedia industry, from the traditional independent game publishers to 
big entertainment conglomerates with deep pockets and copyrights on well-known 
characters and stories. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend is not exactly being welcomed with open arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because a bunch of Hollywood guys show up with 'interactive' on their 
business cards doesn't mean they're going to be successful," says Electronic 
Arts Executive Vice President Bing Gordon, who will be at the show even though 
his company will not have a booth. 
</P>
<P>
 Added George Harrison, marketing director for Nintendo of America, of the new 
competitors in his industry: "It won't necessarily be as easy as they might 
like to think." 
</P>
<P>
 Nintendo, which will have its usual big presence at the show, plans to 
introduce a game featuring a gorilla called Donkey Kong that helped launch its 
business in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 While original characters such as Nintendo's Mario and Sega's Sonic the 
Hedgehog have generated billions of dollars in revenue for the two video game 
companies, media executives argue that as the interactive software market 
broadens and production costs escalate, games based on cultural icons -- such 
as Viacom's "Beavis and Butt-head" (due out this fall) or Fox's upcoming 
Macaulay Culkin film "Pagemaster" -- will have the advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "You take the property content owners, like Fox or MGM or Sony or any of the 
others, and we can now step into this industry and provide the consumer with 
great games and video clips from our libraries," said Ted Hoff, chief of Fox's 
new interactive division, which will be exhibiting an early version of the 
"Pagemaster" game in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, entertainment and publishing companies have typically licensed 
rights to their movies, books and TV shows that are to be turned into 
interactive software by developers specializing in multimedia. But lately, as 
technology advances and the market expands, nearly every media firm has formed 
an interactive publishing arm of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic logic: A game based on a movie that sells a million copies might 
bring $5 million to the studio that licensed it. But the same studio might earn 
four or five times as much by creating and distributing the game itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is substantial risk. As movie executive-turned-video game 
evangelist Strauss Zelnick sees it, only 50% of games succeed, and only 30% of 
movies succeed. So a game based on an upcoming movie has a success probability 
of about 15%. And, says Time Warner Interactive President Terry Hershey, "in a 
business based on creativity, size is not going to predetermine your likelihood 
of success." 
</P>
<P>
 Will Paramount Interactive's "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine" game beat out 
Electronic Arts' "Wing Commander 3"? Can Universal Interactive's "Jurassic 
Park" game top start-up Crystal Dynamics' "Crash and Burn"? Will Sony's 
interactive "Frankenstein," timed to coincide with the release of the TriStar 
movie in November, scare away sales from Virgin Interactive's sequel to the 
popular "7th Guest" CD-ROM game? 
</P>
<P>
 The answers remain in the hands of the teen-age boys who still buy most of the 
video games sold in the United States. But if there was any doubt that the 
media conglomerates and the movie studios have finally arrived in 
Interactiveland, the convention this week should dispel them. 
</P>
<P>
 While old-timers such as Sega and Electronic Arts keep a low profile, says 
Fox's Hoff, "we'll have a very large booth representing Fox Interactive with 
our new logo, and 12 or 15 display stations. We are not approaching (the show) 
timidly." 
</P>
<P>
 Never to be outdone, Disney is sending a full contingent of top executives, 
including Chairman Michael D. Eisner, Vice Chairman Roy Disney and studio 
Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg to host a Disney World-esque extravaganza Friday 
morning to introduce the video game version of "The Lion King." The company is 
also expected to announce a collaboration with Sony Corp.'s electronic 
publishing arm to develop an interactive CD-ROM based on 65 years of Mickey 
Mouse cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
 Universal Interactive Studios will be exhibiting its recently released first 
product, "Jurassic Park"; Time Warner Interactive will have a party to mark the 
consolidation of at least some of its parent company's interactive divisions 
under one umbrella; Viacom New Media will have a huge booth encompassing its 
original new-media group as well as the recently acquired Paramount Interactive 
and Simon & Schuster Interactive. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Electronic Arts' Gordon: "I hope the studios showing up with their 
interactive divisions get great people involved and add glamour and excitement 
at CES. Next year the show is in Philadelphia. It will be interesting to see 
how far the glamorous and exciting people in Hollywood are willing to travel to 
make a show of participation in the interactive business."

 Bank of the West Completes Purchase of Citibank Branches: The San 
Francisco-based unit of the French banking group Banque Nationale de Paris has 
completed its acquisition of Citibank's California unit, expanding Bank of the 
West's network in Northern California.The acquisition, whose terms were not 
disclosed, is the fourth by the unit in four years. Bank of the West's branch 
network has grown from 39 to 106 since 1990. The branch sale is part of a 
restructuring of Citibank's California operations. Last week, the Citicorp unit 
said it will sell the deposits of six San Diego County branches to Great 
Western Bank. After the restructuring, Citibank will have 89 branches in 
California.

 Unocal Sells Interest in 12 Properties: Los Angeles-based Unocal Corp. said it 
sold its interest in the domestic crude oil and natural gas producing 
properties for more than $32 million.The sales to nine companies are the most 
recent activities in an ongoing plan to sell non-strategic assets and focus on 
key production areas, the company said. "We're taking the proceeds from these 
sales and plowing them back into the significant natural gas development 
opportunities that we have available in our key operating areas, particularly 
the Gulf of Mexico," said John F. Imle, Unocal's executive vice president and 
president of Unocal Energy Resources. The 12 fields are in Texas, Mississippi, 
Oklahoma, North Dakota, New Mexico and Wyoming.

 Arco Alaska Inc. to Cut 32% of Work Force: The Atlantic Richfield Co. unit 
said it will cut 750 jobs over the next several months to cope with low oil 
prices and declining production from the giant Prudhoe Bay field. Arco Alaska 
currently has 2,350 employees, 450 fewer than in 1990. Like other oil 
producers, Arco, the No. 7 U.S. oil producer, has been hit hard as oil prices 
plummeted to an average of $16.08 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange 
this year, the lowest price in six years.

 Kentucky Fried Chicken Reinvests in South Africa: The company said it will 
invest $200 million in South Africa in the next three years, building 200 
restaurants and encouraging entrepreneurs in black townships.Bob Bothwell, 
regional vice president of KFC's South Pacific-South Africa region, said the 
expansion will provide jobs to more than 6,000 South Africans. Louisville, 
Ky.-based KFC already has 300 restaurants in South Africa, its most profitable

 CalPERS Makes Direct Investment in Energy Firm: The California Public 
Employees Retirement System has made its first investment under a deal 
announced a year ago, apparently winning -- in tandem with Enron Corp. -- a 
bidding war for Bridge Oil Ltd., an Australian producer of oil and gas.CalPERS, 
the nation's largest public pension fund, said last July that it would invest 
$250 million of its $75 billion in assets in a partnership with Houston-based 
Enron, the largest natural gas producer in North America. Other pension funds 
have made direct investments like the Australian deal, but the CalPERS-Enron 
transaction is one of the largest ever. Pension funds traditionally invest in 
bonds, stocks or real estate.

 Talks Between Caterpillar, UAW Collapse: Negotiations broke down between 
Caterpillar Inc. and the United Auto Workers, with no progress reported and the 
union threatening a strike by 14,000 workers tonight."We tried, we honestly 
tried to avert the strike deadline," UAW Secretary-Treasurer Bill Casstevens 
said. The strike would close Caterpillar factories in Illinois, Memphis, Denver 
and York, Pa. Caterpillar Vice President Wayne Zimmerman said the union won't 
budge on its ultimatum to strike unless the company reinstates 14 fired union 
members. The firings are among 90 unfair-labor-practice complaints that are 
being pursued by the National Labor Relations Board.

INTEL-LIKE CHIPS TO BE SOLD BY IBM; COMPUTERS: MOVE TO MARKET THE X86 WILL PUT 
THE COMPANIES IN DIRECT COMPETITION FOR THE FIRST TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a new threat to Intel Corp.'s dominance of the microprocessor market, 
International Business Machines Corp. said Monday it will start selling a 
version of Intel's x86 chips to other personal computer makers. 
</P>
<P>
 The move puts IBM in direct competition with Intel for the first time. For 
years, IBM has based all its machines on Intel x86 chips, helping make the 
family of microprocessors an industry standard found in an estimated 85% of the 
world's PCs. 
</P>
<P>
 Heating up the competition further, IBM said it is pricing its chips 
significantly below Intel's. 
</P>
<P>
 For Intel, which is already fighting to ward off competition from rivals 
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Cyrix Corp., IBM is expected to be a formidable 
competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a blow to Intel because it puts a serious player like IBM in a direct 
competitive position," Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, a San 
Jose-based market research firm. 
</P>
<P>
 For IBM, besieged by declining margins in most of its computer businesses, the 
chip market holds the promise of fat profit margins. Furthermore, the move is 
in keeping with IBM Chief Executive Louis Gertsner's aim to participate more 
actively in the market for computer components. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel shares fell $1.125 Monday to $58.875, while IBM shares dropped $.75 to 
$61.625. IBM's decision to move into the "merchant market" for microprocessors 
stems from an agreement signed in April with Cyrix, a Richardson, Tex., company 
founded seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM will sell chips based on Cyrix's x86 design, which is fully compatible 
with Intel's technology and allows users to operate the same software. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM will add stand-alone microprocessors to its popular "Blue Lightning" 
family of computer subsystems, which incorporate the chips on PC boards. 
</P>
<P>
 The move enables IBM "to serve a wider range of customers at varying design 
and price targets," said Kevin Dawson, Blue Lightning marketing manager for IBM 
Microelectronics. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM said 5-volt 486 chips will be available in volume in August and 3-volt 
products will be available in September. Samples of the products are now 
available, IBM said. 
</P>
<P>
 The products are priced at $195 to $295 each for volumes of 1,000. That 
compares with Intel 486DX2 chips, which are priced at between $250 and $360. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, IBM and Cyrix signed a five-year agreement under which IBM's 
Microelectronics Division would manufacture for Cyrix advanced x86-compatible 
chips based on Cyrix's design.

JENNY CRAIG INC. SUSPENDS QUARTERLY PAYMENT; DIVIDENDS: NEWS DRIVES SHARE PRICE 
DOWN AND RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT COMPANY'S FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jenny Craig Inc. said Monday that it is suspending payment of its quarterly 
dividend in order to use the funds to market its weight-loss program, raising 
concerns about the company's immediate prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 The news drove the company's shares down $1 to $5.50 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. It had hit an all-time low of $5.25 during the day's trading. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Chief Executive C. Joseph LaBonte denied suggestions that the 
Del Mar, Calif.-based company's condition had worsened. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing could be further from the truth," he said, indicating that business 
is actually improving. 
</P>
<P>
 LaBonte said enrollments at the company's weight-loss centers are increasing 
and that the company expects a profit for the three months ending June 30. "I 
think we've bottomed out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 LaBonte described the dividend suspension as a reasonable step to take when 
the company's cash flow can't fully cover it. "We believe it would be prudent 
to not pay (the dividend) and continue to have a strong balance sheet with no 
debt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company will review dividend policy on a quarterly basis, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Craig Inc. is coming off its worst period since the company went public 
in 1991. For the first three months of this year, it reported a loss of $8.7 
million, caused mostly by a 43% drop in new program enrollments. 
</P>
<P>
 A dividend suspension generally signals an acute need to conserve cash. 
According to LaBonte, Jenny Craig Inc. has about $40 million in cash and 
short-term investments, down 36% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies are loath to halt dividend payments because it alienates 
shareholders who count on the income. The dividend suspension of Jenny Craig 
Inc. will cost founders Sid and Jenny Craig nearly $2.5 million for the quarter 
ending June 30. Sid Craig, company chairman, and Jenny Craig, vice chairwoman, 
together control more than 60% of shares. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last month, director Michael E. Tennenbaum said any decision 
to reduce the dividend would be based not only on the company's cash position, 
but also on "opinions about the future and other opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news is board members own a hell of a lot of stock and would only 
reduce it if they thought they absolutely needed to," Tennenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
 He had no comment Monday. According to company documents, Tennenbaum owns 
nearly 1% of the company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Aug. 31, Jenny Craig Inc. owned 588 weight-loss centers and had 
franchised 220 worldwide. About 90% of revenue comes from sales of packaged 
food.

EYES ARE ON KIDDER AS WOES MOUNT; BROKERAGES: PARENT COMPANY GE DENIES A SALE 
IS IN THE WORKS FOR THE SCANDAL-PLAGUED FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the prominent Wall Street brokerage firm Kidder, Peabody & Co. disclosed 
in April that its chief government bond trader had allegedly falsified 
transactions to create $350 million in bogus profits, the company sought to 
portray the situation as isolated misconduct by a wayward employee. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the chagrin of Kidder and its parent company, General Electric Co., the 
incident has instead focused attention on the overall soundness of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 And many on Wall Street do not like what they see. Kidder is heavily invested 
in exotic securities backed by mortgages, and rising interest rates have 
severely undermined the value of those assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how bad the problems are -- and what General Electric might do about them 
-- is the latest guessing game on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 A front-page article in the Wall Street Journal last week alleged that GE had 
Kidder on "life support" and had been forced to inject $400 million in fresh 
capital into the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one Wall Street source said GE was on the brink of liquidating Kidder 
entirely. Under this scenario, GE would transfer billions of dollars in 
troubled mortgage-backed securities into another GE unit while selling Kidder's 
retail brokerage operations and other marketable assets. 
</P>
<P>
 GE and Kidder vigorously deny such predictions. GE, they say, has injected 
$200 million -- not $400 million -- into the brokerage. And Kidder has hardly 
been a basket case; last year, the brokerage earned $439 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe Kidder Peabody is a strong franchise today, and we fully expect it 
to be an even stronger franchise a decade from now," Dennis D. Dammerman, GE's 
chief financial officer, said last week. Providing "the financial wherewithal 
to support our businesses during difficult times is a hallmark of GE." 
</P>
<P>
 But just as a scandal-ridden Drexel Burnham Lambert was driven out of business 
when the market for junk bonds collapsed, the doomsayers are speculating that 
Kidder will be brought low by its exposure to mortgage-backed securities. No 
other major Wall Street house has anywhere near Kidder's exposure in such 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations surrounding government bond trader Joseph Jett have cast 
serious doubt on the judgment of Kidder management. Jett, who had a spotty 
track record before joining Kidder, suddenly began racking up enormous profits 
in a business where Kidder was not a major force. 
</P>
<P>
 Many believe Jett could not have carried out his scheme without the 
acquiescence of his bosses. Jett denies the allegations; an arbitration case is 
pending. The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an investigation, 
and GE has launched its own inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was a major embarrassment for GE Chairman Jack Welch; GE was 
forced to take a $210-million charge against earnings. But that is small 
potatoes compared to the problems GE might face if Kidder's reported 
$12-billion portfolio of mortgage-backed securities is really in bad shape. 
</P>
<P>
 To start with, Kidder has a far higher ratio of assets to capital than most 
Wall Street firms. That means it is especially vulnerable to declines in the 
value of the assets. And as interest rates have risen, the value of securities 
based on mortgages has plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, many of the securities are exotic "derivatives" that are very 
difficult to value and virtually impossible to sell in a falling market. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Kidder claims to have cut its portfolio of mortgage securities by 
about a third since its peak earlier this year. And many analysts support the 
notion that Kidder's problems have been exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas Heymann of Natwest Securities raised his rating on GE stock last 
week, arguing that "fear about the potential for additional large, onetime 
charges (due to Kidder's problems) is misplaced." 
</P>
<P>
 GE shares fell 37.5 cents to $47.375 on Monday in New York Stock Exchange 
trading, down from a February peak of $54.875, even though Kidder has accounted 
for just 2% of the parent company's operating profit since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Knoblowitz, director at the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's, 
said there is nothing to indicate that GE's AAA credit rating would be 
endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have substantial capacity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One Wall Street analyst who asked not to be named noted that GE, with its 
array of 24 different financial services subsidiaries, has vast experience in 
dealing with troubled portfolios. He speculated that the company might move the 
troubled Kidder assets into another GE subsidiary and then try to sell the 
remnants of Kidder. 
</P>
<P>
 Perrin Long, First of Michigan Corp. analyst, said Kidder's retail brokerage 
might be worth $100 to $150 million -- small change compared to the $1.3 
billion GE has spent on Kidder since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after it acquired a controlling stake in Kidder, GE found itself 
deeply enmeshed in Wall Street's insider trading scandals. Longtime executive 
Martin A. Siegel pleaded guilty to selling inside information to stock 
speculator Ivan F. Boesky, and Kidder was forced to pay more than $25 million 
in fines and penalties. Later, following the market crash of October, 1987, the 
firm -- like other Wall Street giants -- retrenched. 
</P>
<P>
 GE reportedly has been trying to sell Kidder on and off for several years, but 
the brokerage is considered unmarketable with its problems.

FRANCHISEES CLASH WITH PRESIDENT OF CARL'S JR.; RESTAURANTS: THEY VOTE NO 
CONFIDENCE IN EXECUTIVE AT SHAREHOLDERS MEETING. OFFICIALS INSIST THAT VALUE 
MENU WILL WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Carl's Jr. restaurant franchisees used the burger chain's annual shareholder 
meeting Monday as a forum to issue a vote of "no confidence" in President and 
Chief Executive Donald E. Doyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of about 240 franchised restaurants have clashed with Doyle in recent 
months over a value-oriented menu instituted in April to help reverse a 
four-year revenue slide at the 650-unit Carl's Jr. restaurant chain. Doyle 
maintains that the lower-cost menu will help Carl's Jr. lure back customers 
lost in recent years to McDonald's, Taco Bell and other national chains. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is being destroyed," Ed Giammarino, a San Diego-based 
franchise owner, said after the morning meeting held at an Anaheim hotel. "The 
program is not working and we want to know what the company is doing to turn 
the company around." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, CKE Restaurants reported $656,000 in net income for the first 
quarter ended May 23, compared to $158,000 a year ago. Quarterly revenue 
slipped to $135 million, down from $140.1 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman William P. Foley told shareholders that the menu makes Carl's Jr. 
competitive with its major rivals, which early on recognized growing consumer 
demand for better values. Foley, who last year acquired a controlling stake in 
the company and was elected chairman, also acknowledged that it will take time 
to reverse the years-long revenue slide. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley and Doyle said that early returns are positive. "The value menu will 
work," Foley said. "But it's going to take time." 
</P>
<P>
 But franchise owners Giammarino and Nick Trani of Modesto maintained that the 
new menu is not a success. "The numbers we've seen are nowhere near as 
(optimistic) as what the company is saying," Trani said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle said that about 95% of franchise owners instituted the new menu. "Some 
of them thought this would be a silver bullet," Doyle said. "But it's not a 
quick fix. It's going to take time." Franchise owners are always free to set 
their own prices, but most elect to follow the lead set by the company in its 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Giammarino said franchisees will continue to pressure management to restores 
the chain's image as a higher-end fast food company. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's shareholder meeting included an appearance by founder Carl N. 
Karcher, who led shareholders in a prayer and the Pledge of Allegiance at the 
start of the meeting. Last year, Karcher was tossed out as chairman during a 
painful fight with the company's board of directors. Karcher came back to the 
company as chairman emeritus after Foley was elected chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 During the annual meeting held at the Anaheim Marriott hotel, the parent 
company of Carl's Jr. changed its official corporate name to CKE Restaurants 
Inc. from Carl Karcher Enterprises and changed the company's state of 
incorporation to Delaware from California. 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle said the company is on track to open 20 Boston Chicken restaurants by 
the end of this year. The first two restaurants will open early in July in 
Sacramento. The first Orange County location--in Fountain Valley at the corner 
of Brookhurst Street and Garfield Avenue--is scheduled to open July 25. 
</P>
<P>
 CKE Restaurants in January acquired the franchise rights to build as many as 
300 Boston Chicken locations in Southern California and Sacramento. Karcher 
Enterprises' Profit Rises 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a decline in revenue, Carl Karcher Enterprises reported an increase in 
earnings for its latest quarter. The company's results for the same period a 
year earlier were restated to reflect an accounting change. Figures in 
thousands of dollars except data per share: 04,20,10,10,10 1993 1994 % Change

 US Facilities Corp., fighting a hostile takeover attempt, said Monday it has 
appointed John T. Grush president of its US Benefits subsidiary and promoted 
another executive to be the unit's main operating officer as part of a 
management restructuring. 
</P>

 Grush, 45, of Sierra Madre, succeeds Douglas L. Bockus, who left in April 
after disagreeing with a corporate decision to funnel money into a small 
property and casualty subsidiary.Grush has been, and will continue to be, 
president of that smaller unit. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Craig J. Kelbel was promoted to a newly created position as US 
Benefits' executive vice president and chief operating officer. Kelbel, 40, of 
Aliso Viejo, also keeps the duties of his former job as US Benefits' senior 
vice president of underwriting. 
</P>
<P>
 US Benefits, which sells medical stop-loss coverage to self-insured companies, 
provides about 80% of the corporation's consolidated earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, shareholders overwhelmingly voted to put US Facilities up for sale 
to the highest bidder, a proposal put forth by its second-largest shareholder, 
Fidelity National Financial Inc. in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Bockus, who left before learning about Fidelity's $79 million offer for US 
Facilities, has since voiced support for Fidelity's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Fidelity nominees narrowly won election as directors of US Facilities, but 
the corporation is contesting that vote in a lawsuit in Delaware, where it is 
incorporated. US Facilities refuses to take any board action, including steps 
toward a sale, until the court resolves the issue. A hearing is scheduled for 
July 14. 
</P>
<P>
 William P. Foley II, Fidelity's chairman, warned Monday that if US Facilities 
continues to ignore the mandate of shareholders much longer, other investors 
may sue the Costa Mesa company.

FOLEY'S PUSH TO DIVERSIFY FIRM CONTINUES; ACQUISITIONS: PROMINENT TITLE 
INSURANCE INDUSTRY LEADER WANTS TO MAKE HIS FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL LESS 
DEPENDENT ON VOLATILE REAL ESTATE MARKET. 
</P>

 William P. Foley II, directing a hostile takeover of an Orange County 
insurance carrier, has acquired large minority stakes in two other unrelated 
businesses as he continues to diversify his title insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last week, Fidelity National Financial Inc. acquired a 33% stake in 
McFarland Partners investment advisers in San Francisco in addition to the 
previously announced purchase of a 31% interest in Micro General Corp. in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The buying binge is part of Foley's efforts to diversify Fidelity, the 
nation's fifth-largest title insurer, so that earnings rely less on the 
volatile real estate market. Title insurance covers claims against a 
policyholder's ownership of real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a few years, Foley said, he wants half of Fidelity's earnings to come 
from non-title insurance operations. A big chunk of that could come from US 
Facilities Corp., a Costa Mesa medical stop-loss and property and casualty 
insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity is waging a $79-million hostile takeover bid for US Facilities and 
has won a shareholder vote to put US Facilities up for sale. It also has won 
two seats on the US Facilities board of directors, but the corporation has sued 
to overturn the election. The suit is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 McFarland Partners was formed Thursday when Victor McFarland acquired the 
Mellon/McMahan Real Estate Advisors Inc. subsidiary of Mellon Bank in New York. 
McFarland has been a real estate adviser to managers of investment portfolios, 
including the California Public Employees Retirement System. He helped engineer 
CalPERS' share of the $100-million purchase of the Galleria at South Bay mall 
in Redondo Beach two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity provided McFarland with a $4.5-million loan to help with the purchase 
of Mellon/McMahan and received its stake as part of the deal. The loan, 
carrying a 10% interest rate, is to be repaid over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met Bill Foley about four months ago and was impressed with his views," 
McFarland said. "I think we're going to be great partners." 
</P>
<P>
 McFarland said he had many possible partners ready to lend him money but chose 
Fidelity because it was the only lender looking for an ongoing relationship 
with an ability to help the company grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley said he will help McFarland Partners expand through acquisitions of 
other portfolio advisers and the creation or purchase of property management 
firms. He said he also hopes that the company will add to Fidelity's core 
operation, title insurance, though Fidelity would have to compete for that 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, Micro General announced that Fidelity had bought 31% of its stock 
from two venture capital investors. Foley said Monday that Fidelity paid 
$750,000 for the stock and hopes to steer the maker of automated post office 
equipment toward a number of technology opportunities wholly unrelated to title 
insurance. He declined to be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley rose to prominence in the title insurance industry by leading his 
company to fast growth while keeping costs low. But he became familiar to the 
general public last fall when, as a private investor, he led a group of 
investors that bailed hamburger magnate Carl N. Karcher out of financial 
trouble. Foley since has become chairman of Karcher's Anaheim-based company, 
which on Monday was renamed CKE Restaurants Inc.

BOMB TECHNOLOGY MAY BENEFIT CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>

 As auto makers -- conventional and otherwise -- position themselves to meet 
California's 1998 deadline for zero-emission cars, American Flywheel Systems 
Inc. is to announce a deal today to acquire advanced technology from the Energy 
Department's Oak Ridge National Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology was used in a high-speed carbon-fiber flywheel developed by the 
Tennessee laboratory in making centrifuges to isolate radioactive materials for 
nuclear weapons.It could significantly increase the capacity of the company's 
batteries, which store energy in spinning flywheels, according to Edward W. 
Furia, chairman of the small Seattle-based firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, vehicles with flywheel batteries could have several advantages over 
the current generation of electric-battery cars, including a much longer 
driving range. And the faster a flywheel goes, the more energy it can store. 
Furia says the new faster technology will help the company reach its goal of 
having an affordable electric car by 1998, when major car companies must 
introduce zero-emission cars in California showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 American Flywheel also said it will add to its engineering team California 
auto designer Peter Brock, credited with the designs of the Corvette Stingray 
and the Ford Cobras of the 1960s, and Oak Ridge flywheel expert John Coyner. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Richard Darman -- former director of the federal Office of 
Management and Budget and now an investment banker with the Washington-based 
Carlyle Group -- will join a board of advisers that already includes Cabinet 
veterans Elliot L. Richardson and James R. Schlesinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Furia, previously an official of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
founded the company with Michael R. Deland, former chairman of the White House 
Council on Environmental Quality, and engineer Edward S. Zorzi.

 Toshiba for Power Users: Toshiba America's computer division in Irvine raised 
the bar for multimedia portable computers Monday with its introduction of 
several new products, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 The subsidiary of Tokyo-based Toshiba Corp. launched its Satellite T2400C 
notebook PC for computer-philes known as power users. Prices range from $3,099 
to $4,299, depending on options. The computers weigh between 6.5 and 7 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer has multimedia capabilities -- those that combine sound, 
graphics, text and video -- and it features an AccuPoint pointing device, which 
is a touch-sensitive stem that can control a cursor on the computer screen, 
instead of a track ball or computer mouse.

 Omni Technology Sold: Microsemi Corp. in Santa Ana said that it sold its Omni 
Technology Corp. subsidiary to Irvine-based Technology Marketing Inc., a 
25-year-old company that tests electronic components. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology Marketing paid $2.5 million in cash for Omni Technology in San 
Jose, which provides high-reliability screening and testing services for the 
electronics industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Aouizerat, president and chief executive of Technology Marketing, said 
the acquisition would bring more than $5 million in revenue and assets of about 
$1 million to his company.  
</P>
<P>
 Microsemi, which makes electronic chips known as discrete semiconductors, sold 
the business to focus on its core operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Frey, chairman of Microsemi, said the sale completes the restructuring 
plan announced by the company several years ago.

CYPRESS COMPANY TO BUY UNIT FROM HEWLETT-PACKARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hyatt Die Cast & Engineering Corp. said Monday it has reached a tentative 
agreement to acquire the die casting and finishing business of giant 
Hewlett-Packard Co. for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction, which would add about 40 employees to Hyatt's operations, is 
expected to be completed this fall, H-P executives said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cypress company, which makes casings and other metal parts for computers 
and other products, said it will move H-P's die casting division from its Palo 
Alto fabrication center to a new structure in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyatt plans to supply finished metal components to H-P's worldwide businesses 
and to about 30 non-Hewlett-Packard customers in the Bay area. Hyatt will 
continue its own manufacturing line, including parts for golf clubs and 
aircraft, with 100 employees at its 12-acre headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale is part of H-P's three-year plan to sell certain lines of business to 
companies that specialize in making those products.

MAN SENTENCED FOR RECEIVING STOLEN CHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Garden Grove businessman was sentenced to eight months in jail last week 
after he was convicted of receiving stolen computer chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara Superior Court Judge Diane Northway sentenced Mark Roslawski to 
eight months in jail and two years probation, said Roslawski's attorney, Stuart 
D. Kirchick. 
</P>
<P>
 Roslawski, who is currently free on his own recognizance but must report to 
the jail Sept. 12, plans to appeal the sentence, Kirchick said. If he can find 
a job, Roslawski may qualify for a work-furlough program, where he would work 
during the day and return to jail at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Roslawski contended he didn't know the Intel Corp. computer chips he was 
brokering were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not pleased," Kirchick said. "You have no victim here, just a 
businessman with no criminal history whose life has been totally destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
 Roslawski was arrested in a sting in Santa Clara in October, 1992. He was 
convicted of receiving stolen goods, which carries a maximum sentence of three 
years in prison, but was acquitted on a charge of intent to receive stolen 
goods.

NEW PRESIDENT NAMED BY ABBEY HEALTHCARE; MANAGEMENT: THE HEAD OF A COMPANY 
RECENTLY ACQUIRED BY THE COSTA MESA FIRM WAS SELECTED TO FILL THE POSITION.

 Abbey Healthcare Group Inc. appointed a new president Monday, filling a 
position that had been vacant since February. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerilyn P. Asher, the new executive, will keep her current position of 
president at Protocare Inc. of Waltham, Mass., which Abbey acquired in March in 
a $12 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Monday, Abbey said it has promoted Steven T. Plochocki to chief operating 
officer from executive vice president of sales and operations. The position is 
a new one, Abbey said, to oversee both of the fast-growing company's 
businesses: home health care and home infusion and respiratory therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're integrating the two businesses, getting them to work together," said 
Timothy M. Aitken, Abbey's chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which had $329 million in revenue for 1993, has spent more than 
$240 million to acquire 31 companies during the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those purchases was Total Pharmaceutical Care, a Torrance-based company 
that Abbey bought in September for $197 million. At the time, Abbey hired 
Victor Chaltiel, chairman and president of Total Pharmaceutical, as its own 
president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Abbey announced that Chaltiel had resigned. The executive 
subsequently filed a lawsuit against Abbey alleging wrongful termination. 
</P>
<P>
 Protocare, which provides home infusion and nursing services from 16 locations 
on the East Coast, is well regarded in the industry, and the addition of Asher 
to Abbey's executive circle should boost investor confidence, one analyst said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's stock closed at $14 on Monday, down $1 in trading on the Nasdaq 
market.

POOR-PERFORMING FUND MAY BE GOOD BUY; INVESTMENTS: CONVENTIONAL WISDOM SAYS 
DON'T DO IT, BUT A RESPECTED INDUSTRY EXPERT SAYS AT LEAST CONSIDER IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLINT WILLIS, REUTERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, you've been reading advice telling you not to buy the mutual funds 
at the top of last year's performance rankings. Now a respected mutual fund 
industry spokesman says you should consider buying some of the funds at the 
bottom of those lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Fossel, chairman of the Oppenheimer family of mutual funds, recently urged 
investors to buy the worst-performing funds in their favorite fund families. He 
figures that a good mutual fund family's worst performer is probably run by a 
pro whose investment strategy is temporarily out of style; thus, the fund 
probably holds a bunch of good stocks that have been poor performers. 
</P>
<P>
 When styles change, those holdings will rebound sharply and the fund will pull 
ahead of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 Fossel calculated that Oppenheimer shareholders who followed that strategy 
from 1988 through 1993 would have turned $10,000 into $25,000, versus only 
$20,400 for the average Oppenheimer fund during that period. 
</P>
<P>
 That evidence is interesting, but not conclusive. Some fund families' worst 
funds in a given year will continue to be dogs for another year -- or even 
longer. Some of them are simply bad funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Fossel's larger point is compelling: One of the best ways to make money 
in funds is to buy terrific funds when they are temporarily in the doldrums. 
There are plenty of opportunities to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the best managers have bad years. John Neff of the Vanguard Windsor Fund 
and Michael Price of Mutual Shares are two of the most successful money 
managers of the past several decades. But both struggled through a couple of 
years of sub-par performance during the recent bull market. During the past 
year, both managers have handily outperformed their peers. 
</P>
<P>
 Any opportunities out there now? Absolutely. To find them, I reviewed funds 
with solid long-term records (all of them earned four- or five-star rankings 
for their five-year risk-adjusted performance from Morningstar, the Chicago 
mutual-fund rating firm). Among those funds, I looked at the ones that have 
delivered the worst performance over the past 12 months. They include the three 
diversified no-load funds that I describe below. All of them are worth 
consideration for long-term investors: 
</P>
<P>
 * Evergreen Total Return ((800) 235-0064; $2,000 minimum purchase): This 
conservatively managed fund has posted a 0.32% loss during the past 12 months. 
Veteran manager Nola Falcone relies heavily on stocks with high yields to boost 
investors' income and cushion the fund from losses in more aggressive stocks. 
That strategy backfired when interest rates rose in 1993's fourth quarter, 
pummeling income-oriented investments ranging from bonds to high-dividend 
stocks. But over the past three years, the fund has delivered solid returns of 
11.2% annually at less than half the risk of a typical equity fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * FAM Value ((800) 932-3271; $2,000). This fund was closed to new investors 
until March 23. Now that its doors have opened wide once again, some investors 
may be reluctant to invest their money with managers Thomas Putnam and Diane 
Van Buren, who delivered a mere 0.24% return during the past year. But they're 
missing an opportunity for future gains. The fund, which invests in shares of 
out-of-favor companies, has delivered 13.3% annual gains over the past five 
years, at considerably less risk than the typical equity fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * Royce Equity Income ((800) 221-4268; $2,000). This fund invests in shares of 
small companies, which tend to be relatively volatile. But fund managers Tom 
Ebright and Chuck Royce take a conservative approach, choosing shares of 
undiscovered companies or firms that are experiencing temporary troubles. In 
other words, they buy small company stocks when they are extremely cheap. The 
managers also look for shares that provide above-average dividend yields. The 
result: The fund's shares have climbed 15.7% annually during the past three 
years; meanwhile, the fund has been far less volatile than the typical stock 
fund. With only $93 million in assets under management, Royce Equity Income is 
an overlooked gem.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: FIDELITY FEDERAL BANK RESTRUCTURING OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citadel Holding Corp. in Glendale said that its board has approved a 
restructuring and recapitalization plan to bolster capital levels at its 
troubled Fidelity Federal Bank subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, adopted under pressure from federal regulators, calls for Fidelity 
to sell $490 million of problem real estate assets, of which $24.5 million 
would be acquired by Citadel. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity would also sell $110 million of new common stock to pay debts and 
improve its capital position, Citadel said. On Friday, Fidelity said it filed 
documents with the Office of Thrift Supervision for a proposed offering of 
about 21 million to 22 million shares for $5.25 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Citadel said the transactions would address concerns by the OTS, the federal 
agency that monitors the financial health of savings and loans, about the 
quality of Fidelity's assets and capital levels. 
</P>
<P>
 After the recapitalization, the new stock issued by Fidelity would represent 
more than 75% of Fidelity's outstanding shares of common stock, while Citadel's 
stake in Fidelity would be less than 25%. Citadel's final ownership interest in 
Fidelity would depend upon such factors as Fidelity's second quarter operating 
results, the prices fetched for the assets and the level of Fidelity's troubled 
assets as of June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Also under the plan, Fidelity would transfer other assets to Citadel, 
including Citadel's corporate headquarters. Fidelity would elect a new board of 
directors, with three current directors remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The restructuring is expected to reduce Fidelity's problem assets to less than 
1% of its total assets, and increase its core capital to more than 5% of total 
assets, the company said.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: SYNCOR EXPECTS PROFIT TO BE LOWER THAN PROJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Syncor International Corp., a Chatsworth provider of specialty 
pharmaceuticals, said it expects to report a profit of about $700,000 to $1 
million for its second quarter ending June 30, well below analysts' 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's net sales are expected to range from $81 million to $82 million. 
</P>
<P>
 A year earlier, Syncor earned $3.1 million from continuing operations on net 
sales of $59.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Syncor said its financial results have been hurt by lower prices it adopted 
because of competition, and its plan to increase its market penetration and 
market share with certain products.

FIRM WITH TROUBLED PAST TURNS TO OUTSIDER; PERFECTDATA: SIMI VALLEY COMPANY TO 
FOCUS AGAIN ON OFFICE EQUIPMENT CLEANING SUPPLIES AFTER A CEO'S RESIGNATION AND 
A FUND-DRAINING MODEM VENTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The reporters' calls have stopped, as has the whispering in PerfectData's 
hallways about Lee Mannheimer, the company's longtime chief executive officer 
who resigned last fall amid law enforcement's investigation into his possible 
role in an alleged murder-for-hire plot against his estranged wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Mannheimer, 51, has denied involvement in the alleged plot. But the Ventura 
County district attorney's office says the investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, PerfectData Corp. has its own problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Primarily a marketer of computer-cleaning products, PerfectData expanded into 
the computer modem business as part of Mannheimer's diversification strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Joseph Mazin, PerfectData's controlling shareholder who took over as CEO 
last November, admitted that modems have been "a huge cash drain" on the 
company. Although Mazin declined to say on the record what he would do, the 
Simi Valley-based company is expected to quit the modem business shortly. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazin, 47, is also chairman and CEO of Flamemaster Corp. in Sunland. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of its 18-year history, PerfectData has focused on selling cleaning 
ware for office equipment, mainly small-ticket items such as spray dusters and 
towelettes for computers, fax machines and copiers. Three years ago, the 
company invested heavily to develop a line of computer modems that it claimed 
were easier to plug in and use than other modems in the market. But 
PerfectData's modems never took off. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazin said PerfectData lacked the resources to keep up with rapidly changing 
technology and new products. The company's warehouse is now loaded with about 
$750,000 worth of modems and components -- many of them outdated, Mazin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The modems were behind PerfectData's loss of $297,000 on revenue of $5.2 
million for the nine months that ended Dec. 31, its latest reported period. The 
loss contrasted with a profit of $342,000 on slightly higher revenue in the 
comparable period a year earlier. One plus is that PerfectData has no long-term 
debt and a net worth of $4.1 million as of Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazin says he intends to concentrate on PerfectData's cleaning products, which 
remain profitable. PerfectData also markets computer accessories such as wrist 
rests and copy holders, as well as a foot rest designed for use in the office. 
Mazin hopes to expand into the ergonomic office-equipment market, which is 
growing rapidly and could help solve PerfectData's perennial problem: its 
limited market. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the market for computer-cleaning supplies is tiny because only 1% 
of the nation's personal computer owners ever clean their machines. That's why 
Mannheimer wanted to get into modems three years ago, and why his predecessor 
in the mid-1980s took a run at supplying floppy disks. The floppy disk venture 
also failed, and when Mannheimer came on board in 1986 he abandoned that 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Mannheimer initially turned the company around by refocusing on cleaning 
products and sharply cutting costs, but then he got into modems. 
</P>
<P>
 And then last October, Mannheimer's personal problems set in when authorities 
in Northern California said a tip from an FBI informant helped foil a plot to 
kill Linda Mannheimer, who at the time was involved in a divorce battle with 
her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 That month, Mannheimer stepped down voluntarily as CEO pending the 
investigation, but Mazin said Mannheimer will not be coming back as an officer 
of the company. Mannheimer remains a member of the board of directors at 
PerfectData, and he owns 4.6% of its common stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Like others at the company, Irene Marino, PerfectData's chief financial 
officer since 1982, said she was shocked about the alleged murder-for-hire 
plot. With calls from national television news reporters and photographers at 
the company's offices in Simi Valley, Marino says Mannheimer's personal 
problems were a big distraction the company didn't need. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the negative publicity, both Marino and Mazin say Mannheimer's 
problems haven't hurt the company and that employee morale remains good. 
</P>
<P>
 But the same can't be said of the company's stock, which closed Monday at 
$0.9375. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Frank McCormick, a broker-trader with J. Alexander Securities in Los 
Angeles, said: "Joe Mazin is a good manager. I think he'll do well for the 
company." 
</P>
<P>
 Mazin's Flamemaster group is PerfectData's biggest shareholder, with 33% of 
the outstanding stock. Flamemaster is a maker of industrial sealants, adhesives 
and coatings, and Mazin also owns a metal fabrication business. Mazin first 
bought PerfectData's stock in the mid-1980s, but he purchased most of it last 
year in the $1.50 per share price range. He came on as a director of the 
company last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Early last year, Mazin says he thought PerfectData's modems could still be 
profitable, and he figured if nothing else the company could spin off the modem 
business. But after he came on as CEO in November, Mazin delved into the 
company's books and found that it wasn't worth continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazin says he never thought he would be involved in the company. Now he comes 
to Simi Valley every morning, and in the afternoon he hurries to Flamemaster. 
Mazin said PerfectData couldn't afford to hire a full-time CEO, and his plan is 
to continue indefinitely. Mazin says he is getting less than a $60,000 salary 
for his work at PerfectData. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his dual CEO duties, Mazin says he's trying to run PerfectData and 
Flamemaster as one company. "What's good for one is good for the other," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Flamemaster has started to make cleaning solutions for PerfectData. 
Mazin added that he's looking for more acquisitions that could help PerfectData 
grow.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: OROAMERICA REPORTS 61% PROFIT DROP IN 1ST QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OroAmerica Inc., a Burbank manufacturer and distributor of gold jewelry, 
reported that its profit declined 61% in its fiscal first quarter that ended 
March 29, to $650,000 from $1.65 million in net income a year earlier.

<P>
 The company's net sales rose 9% in the latest quarter, to $48.1 million from 
$44.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 OroAmerica said the drop in earnings was primarily due to inventory accounting 
changes because of a substantial reduction in the amount of gold owned by the 
company.

 Beverly Hills Fan Co. in Woodland Hills reported that its fiscal 
second-quarter earnings plunged 80% and that its sales in the quarter fell 15%,

earthquake damage and curtailed deliveries because of the dock strike in April, 
it said.

 Advanced Photonix Inc., a Camarillo maker of silicon photodetectors, reported 
increased losses for its fiscal fourth quarter and year ended April 3. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's fourth-quarter loss was $1.65 million, in contrast to a

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: 2 FIRMS TO SET UP LOCAL PLANTS, ADD TO PROFESSIONAL 
RANKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two companies have announced plans to establish large plants in Ventura County 
in the fall and to begin recruiting employees immediately to fill mostly 
high-paying professional jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the moves, Xircom Inc., a fast-growing Calabasas company that claims 
to be the world leader in producing devices for connecting portable computers 
with corporate computer networks, has decided to move its 220 Southern 
California employees to a two-building complex in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The move, planned for October, will mean an ongoing boon for Ventura County's 
job market, according to Xircom spokesman Serge Timacheff. "We expect our 
revenues to increase 50% in the current year, and our payroll will probably 
expand at about the same rate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Xircom is moving from a 70,000-square-foot building in Calabasas to a complex 
totaling 130,000 square feet on Corporate Center Drive. Work now being done at 
another facility in Westlake Village will also be moved to Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Xircom has 280 employees worldwide, including offices in Mountain View, 
Calif., and Antwerp, Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's sales in the year that ended Sept. 30 were $82.2 million. 
Analysts have projected revenues of more than $120 million in the current 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, BioSource International Inc., a Camarillo supplier of 
immunological reagents and test kits used in biomedical research and diagnosis, 
said it will consolidate all its California operations, including its main 
production and research facility in Northern California, into a 
27,000-square-foot building a block away from its present corporate 
headquarters in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The relocation and an accompanying production expansion will increase the 
company's payroll in Ventura County sixfold, bringing 60 new jobs to Camarillo, 
according to Investor Relations Director Aspasia Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our business is booming," she said. "We knew we wanted to centralize and 
expand, but we weren't sure whether we'd end up here or in the north." Lower 
real estate costs in Southern California helped tilt the decision toward 
Camarillo, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander said only a dozen people are now employed at BioSource's corporate 
headquarters on Flynn Road, but that the payroll will increase when research, 
production and marketing workers are added. The move into the newly leased 
facility is scheduled for October. 
</P>
<P>
 BioSource acquired its Northern California plant in Burlingame when it merged 
with Tago Inc. in May, 1993. Only half of the 40 biological scientists, lab 
technicians and marketing personnel there are expected to move to Camarillo. In 
addition to replacing those who choose not to relocate, BioSource expects to 
hire 20 in response to improving business, Alexander said.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: HOME SALES INCREASE 10TH CONSECUTIVE MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Home sales in Ventura County increased for the 10th month in a row in May, 
rising 33% over the same month last year. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 1,005 houses and condominiums changed hands last month, according 
to escrows surveyed by Dataquick Information Systems. The total includes both 
new and existing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices, however, continued to fall. The median price for homes sold in the 
county last month was $183,000, down nearly 10% from May, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reporting service. TRW REDI Property Data, said that in the first five 
months of this year, a total of 3,775 homes were sold in the county, up 18% 
from a year earlier. The median price through May this year was $226,280, down 
2%.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: HEALTH CARE FIRM HOPES TO BUY VENTURA SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A large health-maintenance organization has opened escrow to purchase land in 
Ventura as a possible site for a medical office building valued at between $5 
million and $10 million. Apparently, however, the deal isn't written in stone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely want to build a facility somewhere in Ventura County, but I'm 
not sure it will be on that property," said Kurt Davis, a spokesman for the 
HMO, Foundation Health Plan. He noted that "it's a long escrow, and there are 
quite a few hoops to be jumped through before it closes." 
</P>
<P>
 The property in question is a 5.2-acre site off Telephone Road, across from 
the County Government Center. Many of Foundation's 30,000 members in Ventura 
County are county employees who work at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation, based in Rancho Cordova, a Sacramento suburb, claims to be one of 
the nation's 10 largest HMOs. It will probably employ 25 doctors and about 75 
support personnel at its Ventura County facility, wherever it is built, Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Foundation nor Raznick Realty Group, owner of the Ventura property, 
would disclose terms of the tentative purchase.

COMMERCIAL COMBAT; MAKER OF MILITARY PRINTERS PLOTS STRATEGY FOR THE CIVILIAN 
ARENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Much has changed at Datametrics Corp. since the ailing defense contractor 
began plotting its entry into civilian markets. Even the office layout has been 
shifted. Now managers working on new commercial projects are in a separate 
building from their defense counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 For three decades, Datametrics made its name making $60,000 printers that 
could churn out flawless color prints of battle maps on tanks and battleships. 
Now, the Chatsworth company's future depends on a $30,000 machine that can 
print 20 color pages a minute and handle huge jobs for commercial print shops. 
If it catches on, it could rescue the small company from its dependence on 
shrinking U.S. defense budgets.  
</P>
<P>
 Like many Southern California defense companies attempting to convert to 
civilian industry, the task is not easy, especially for those as tiny as 
Datametrics, which posted a $1.5-million profit on $24 million in revenue last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Datametrics, which still depends on defense contracts for 90% of its sales, 
has taken five years to get to the point of breaking into the commercial 
marketplace. And its future is still far from assured. Defense conversion "is 
very, very hard" said Jack Van Buren, Datametrics' chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 As Datametrics enters the color printer business it will face plenty of 
competition. Datametrics "may have superb technology. But is it one the market 
wants to buy?" asked Rohit Shukla, executive director of the Regional 
Technology Alliance in Los Angeles. "That has not been well answered. A number 
of extremely wonderful products never make it." 
</P>
<P>
 The market for speedy, high-quality color printers remains small: Unit sales 
range from 4,000 to 10,000 annually. But the public's appetite for color 
computer printouts is growing, and the potential market is vast, said Rob 
Auster, vice president of electronic printers at the consulting firm BIS 
Strategic Decisions. Datametrics hopes to forge a partnership with a major 
printer manufacturer. IBM, Kodak, Xerox and Polaroid have been mentioned as 
possible candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 One observer who is enthusiastic about Datametrics' new printer is Seth 
Feinstein, a senior analyst for Crowell, Weedon & Co. in Los Angeles. The 
printers' sales "will totally dwarf the defense side of the business, if they 
are successful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But most financial analysts don't even follow Datametrics, and the stock, 
which has lagged for years, closed Monday at $3.56 per share. 
</P>
<P>
 For years Datametrics' staple was federal government contracts, including 
building printers for Raytheon Co. that were used to support its Patriot 
missile system, and printers and workstations for the Air Force. The company 
still has about half the market for printers used in the U.S. armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, when new Chief Executive Officer Sid Wing arrived, "there were 100 
people in here," he said, gesturing toward the company's manufacturing floor, 
where workers now number only dozens. "I thought, 'This is really a dynamic 
company.' But it was just printers cycling around" being repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Wing found that despite all the activity on the manufacturing floor, the 
company wasn't finishing its work on time, and Datametrics was recording 
revenues as if all its production were on schedule. Reality caught up at the 
end of fiscal 1989, when Datametrics was forced to post a $2-million loss. 
</P>
<P>
 That year, Wing began what he calls "reconstructive surgery" on Datametrics. 
In 1989, more than 200 employees lost their jobs -- a 60% reduction in staff. 
The employees who remained signed statements outlining their responsibilities, 
and managers would be called into strategy sessions lasting days. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wing, 63, said his first priority was to instill discipline into the firm's 
accounting and operations. "Discipline" is a word used often by Wing, a runner 
who works out at 5:30 a.m. "A mistake people make in conversion is thinking a 
new commercial business will provide them with the necessary revenues to pull 
them out and save the day," he said. "But your first step is taking care of 
your base business." 
</P>
<P>
 Datametrics posted a $213,000 loss for the six months ending May 1 on revenues 
of $12.4 million, in part because Wing is boosting its research and development 
spending. The company holds about $4.5 million in cash, thanks to a stock 
offering of 2 million shares in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Datametrics also acquired Rugged Digital Systems Inc., which 
specializes in adapting commercial computer equipment for military uses. This 
year Rugged Digital is expected to account for 45% of Datametrics' sales. 
Bolstering Datametrics' defense business was a way of buying time, Wing said, 
and allowed it to spend about $5 million in four years to develop commercial 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 That research has produced a new commercial printer called Laura, named for 
the daughter of its lead inventor, Gary L. Mallaley, now Datametrics' director 
of commercial imaging products. The company believes the speed of its printer 
represents a breakthrough in color printers at the high end of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Color printers of similar design put pigment on paper one color at a time, 
overlapping the colors in a series of separate passes, a slow process that 
usually prints about two pages per minute. But Laura deposits all the color 
onto a page in a single pass, an innovation that speeds printing to about 20 
pages per minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Although high-tech printers made by established rivals Xeikon and Indigo Ltd. 
can print 30 pages per minute, they cost upward of $200,000. Laura is expected 
to sell for around $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Datametrics aims to sell to print shops that produce brochures, sales 
presentations and instructional manuals. In 1991 it got a $600,000 development 
contract with Halliburton Co., which uses the printers to plot seismic data. 
Datametrics also signed a tentative deal with New York-based Azon Corp., which 
wants the printers to make vanity license plates and street signs. 
</P>
<P>
 For many defense firms, good technology isn't enough, said Eric Rosenfeld, 
defense transition specialist at Joint Venture: Silicon Valley Network, an 
organization formed to aid conversion. "You are either . . . part of the 
defense ghetto or you are part of the entrepreneurial set. . . . Very few 
defense firms turn their swords into plowshares." 
</P>
<P>
 Datametrics' situation illustrates the difficulty many defense firms face. The 
company's prowess in technology is considerable. Its most innovative products 
include heavy, black, typewriter-sized printers designed to withstand a nuclear 
blast. But changing the company's accounting and production methods and 
revising its corporate culture have brought on the headaches of the last five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, printers and workstations built for the military are designed for 
inspections and fine-tuning after shipment. But most commercial buyers expect 
strict quality-control measures to be complete before buying. Also, defense 
firms usually have no mass marketing, production or distribution networks. And 
there are differences in accounting, since many government contracts pay a 
percentage of the costs as they are incurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the problem of the past. "It's that, that mind-set," said Van 
Buren, the chief financial officer, his voice betraying frustration. "It is 
very hard to overcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, so great a gap exists between Datametrics' defense and commercial sides 
that the two have been segregated in different buildings and are now separated 
by a few yards of asphalt parking lot. "You don't want to carry over the habits 
of one industry into the other," Wing said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense side of the complex has the dreary, institutional feel of a 
military bureaucracy. But the commercial offices have a festive look. There, 
strips of colorful computer printouts flutter from the walls, tacked up by 
engineers as they tested commercial uses for Laura. It says something about the 
new mood at Datametrics that no one bothers to take them down. 
</P>
<P>
 But just shifting offices is not enough to disguise the company's defense 
bent. Datametrics managers complain that the maze of drab, narrow hallways in 
both buildings makes the plant look like the Cold War job shop it has always 
been.  
</P>
<P>
 So this summer, Datametrics will vacate the two '60s-era buildings in 
Chatsworth and move to newer, more commercial-looking quarters in Warner 
Center. The move, said Van Buren, "will give our people a new outlook on life. 
At least that's what we are hoping."

A FRESHLY BROOD CUP OF CYNICISM; POP MUSIC: TRUE TO FORM, THE SMITHEREENS LOOK 
AT THE DARK SIDE IN 'DATE.' THEY'RE AT THE COACH HOUSE TONIGHT. 
</P>

 "A Date With the Smithereens"? The title of the veteran rock group's latest 
release is, of course, a tongue-in-cheek lift from an old Elvis album: For any 
dreamy-eyed teen-age girl of the '90s, the idea of a night on the town with 
these guys probably would elicit horrified shrieks rather than coy giggles. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the CD booklet is a photo with members of the proudly middle-aged, 
scraggly looking quartet, which performs tonight at the Coach House, proffering 
wilted bouquets and half-eaten boxes of chocolates. 
</P>
<P>
 The dark, brooding sound emanating from the disc pays perfect complement to 
the sardonic, bitter lyrics. This is music for disgruntled adults, not 
romance-minded adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
 At the blackened heart of the album -- the group's first for RCA -- is the 
often-amusingly cranky rantings of Smithereens front man and songwriter Pat 
DiNizio, who seems to very much enjoy wallowing in his own cynicism. 
</P>
<P>
 "These songs say a lot about my sense of disenchantment with life in general," 
DiNizio said in a recent phone interview. "It's probably the most honest 
collection of songs that I've been able to come up with. I think it's a great 
record. I don't know that everyone is gonna get it, but I think it's the best 
one we've done in years." 
</P>
<P>
 "A Date with the Smithereens" is an Angst- ridden roar from a band already 
known for its uncompromising, against-the-grain vision and guitar-driven, 
hook-laden song craft. Guitars buzz like runaway chain saws, the hooks pound 
into memory, the lyrics provoke disturbing thoughts and questions about life, 
love and human motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Jersey-bred, New York-based group, which includes drummer Dennis 
Diken, guitarist Jim Babjak and bassist Mike Mesaros, formed in 1980. The group 
spent five years as the stereotypical struggling band before being signed by 
Enigma Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Five albums, two EPs and a new label later, even in the face of the ebb and 
flow of popular trends, the group's sound and direction remain finely honed, 
its essential power, wit and intellect undiminished. 
</P>
<P>
 The road hasn't been paved with milk and honey, although the group has scored 
the minor hit here and there with such songs as "Behind the Wall of Sleep," 
"Blood and Roses" and "A Girl Like You." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was never easy for us," said DiNizio, 37. "We were always different, from 
Day One. It took us five years to get our first record deal, which was on an 
independent label that signed us for $2,000. We've always been a bit out of 
time, never really fitting into one category. We were our own category. We've 
always refused to bow to conventions of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came up in an era where the popular bands were rockabilly revivalists (or) 
synth-pop bands like the Human League, who we detested," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now what's selling these days is skinny, pretty little long-haired guys who 
are 21 years old. We're living in the era of the non-songwriter hit. There 
seems to be a lot of songs based on the riff, where the melody is just sort of 
improvised in a haphazard way." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, DiNizio said he doesn't listen to much pop at home, favoring 
jazz instead. Still, he said, he holds a soft spot in his heart for the music 
of the '60s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The early '70s was a great time to be young and listening to music," he said. 
"You had the glam scene -- Bowie, T-Rex and Gary Glitter, then you had your 
avant-glam stuff like Roxy Music and the Eno/Fripp collaborations, you had King 
Crimson and Yes, all that stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "You had the Who, you had groups like Black Sabbath, Deep Purple and Uriah 
Heep, which were real metal groups, not this hybrid stuff that doesn't mean 
anything. If you were so inclined, you had what I considered lightweight groups 
like Loggins & Messina and America. I never liked Southern rock, but you had 
Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Allman Brothers. You had all this stuff coexisting on 
Top 40 radio, and I think it was a particularly healthy time. That and the 
classic AM radio of the '60s is what I grew up listening to." 
</P>
<P>
 If times and sounds have radically changed since DiNizio was a young music 
fan, the Smithereens have remained reliably consistent in style, personnel and 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always been ambitious about what we do, believing in ourselves and our 
music," he said. "We've never changed, we've always done what we do, and we've 
never tried to be anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Smithereens, the Grays and Factory perform tonight at the Coach House, 
33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. 8 p.m. $21.50. (714) 496-8930.

HE'S A LONG WAY FROM THE WATER COOLER; TELEVISION: CARLOS MENCIA, HOSTING 'LOCO 
SLAM' THIS MONTH, TURNED TO COMEDY AFTER BEING ENCOURAGED BY HIS CO-WORKERS AT 
AN INSURANCE COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For a guy with a stand-up comedy career that's currently zipping along like a 
bullet train, Carlos Mencia has a shocking admission to make. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never a funny guy," says the 25-year-old native of East Los Angeles. "I 
was never the guy cracking jokes at school. I was the kid in the back of the 
classroom who shut up and did his work. Half the students didn't know who I 
was, and the other half hated me for ruining the grading curve." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has seen this graduate of Garfield High stalking a comedy club 
stage might find it hard to believe that the energetic, irreverent performer 
was ever the quiet type. The young comic takes on his audiences with a mix of 
streetwise bravado and exuberant playfulness, often working himself into a 
voluble frenzy. Alternately crude and crafty, Mencia holds nothing back, 
whether he's discussing the lighter side of condoms or the uglier aspects of 
racism. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Mencia's mix of insight and outrage can be heard nationwide. This month 
he has been hosting HBO's "Loco Slam," a late-night, "Def Comedy Jam"-styled 
stand-up show geared toward a Latino audience. He'll also get his first comedy 
special on the July 7 "HBO Comedy Half-Hour." And he has completed a sitcom 
pilot, which is currently being shopped around. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a rush to have good things happening for me," Mencia says. "But I've 
always had a very strong work ethic. I'm an aggressive person. For the last 
four years I've worked an average of 10 times a week in the clubs, and 
sometimes I've done six sets all over town in one night. As soon as I saw I 
could get people to laugh, I wanted to be as funny as humanly possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Mencia's first step toward the world of stand-up was taken in the unlikely 
offices of Farmers Insurance, where he worked full time while carrying a full 
course load in electrical engineering at Cal State Los Angeles. Mencia started 
attracting a crowd around the water cooler as he re-interpreted the jokes he'd 
picked up from comics on "The Tonight Show." Rather than muzzle him, his 
superiors encouraged him to make a career switch. 
</P>
<P>
 "This old guy who I'd never seen smile called me into the office one day. I 
was shocked when he said I should consider doing stand-up for a living. I 
dismissed the idea at first, but I told one of my cousins about it, and he 
finally talked me into giving it a try. I signed up for an open mike slot at 
the Laugh Factory. We got three minutes, and I ran out of material in 2 1/2. 
But I got some laughs. I knew I didn't want to be an electrical engineer 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Mencia quickly settled in at the Comedy Store, where, aside from developing 
his stage skills, he also parked cars and worked the door. "That was my 
training ground. I watched every comic I could to study what worked and what 
didn't. I recorded myself every time I was on stage and listened to it on the 
way home. I was methodical. And I started to get confident. Then, when I saw 
Paul Mooney, who could talk about racial troubles and be hilarious at the same 
time, I realized there was more to this comedy thing than making people laugh. 
I realized you could teach people through laughter." 
</P>
<P>
 What Mencia seeks to teach is tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It becomes a 'we' thing on stage. Even if I'm saying things in an angry way, 
it speaks to the anger in everybody. You don't have to be Latin to understand 
the fact that having no Mexicans in Taco Bell commercials is wrong. We can all 
recognize stupidity together. In my act, I talk about this cleaners' sign I've 
seen -- 'Open 7 days a week, including Sunday.' The sign reads that way because 
somebody kept asking, 'Seven days a week? What about Sunday?' A crowd of any 
color can understand what's stupid and funny about that." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say that Mencia hasn't been challenged by audience members. At 
one Comedy Store show, a patron threatened to assault him if the comic didn't 
stop poking fun at white people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Look, you guys made a movie called "Green Card" without any Mexicans 
in it. You made a movie called "Alien" without any Mexicans in it. The only 
time Mexicans get into movies about the future is when Ricardo Montalban steals 
a spaceship. If we made a movie called "Gold Card" and didn't put any white 
people in it, you'd be pissed too.' " 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Mencia launched into a comic rant that broke the crowd up 
completely, and eventually even the heckler was won over. "After the show he 
asked me for my number, and now he comes to see me all the time. Those are the 
shows that are important. If you can get a guy to go from wanting to kick your 
butt, to wanting to see your act again, you're doing all right." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Loco Slam" airs Friday at midnight on HBO. Mencia's appearance on "HBO 
Comedy Half-Hour" airs July 7 at 11 p.m.

'PLAYA VISTA STUDIOS' A NEW ANNEX FOR HOLLYWOOD?; MOVIES: AEROSPACE FIRMS ARE 
LEAVING THE AREA, ABANDONING 17 BUILDINGS INCLUDING HANGAR-LIKE STRUCTURES THAT 
COULD BE CONVERTED INTO SOUND STAGES AND OFFICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new Hollywood studio complex with sound stages made from converted aircraft 
hangars and office space for movie and TV production companies is being 
discussed for Playa Vista, a mammoth development planned for the Westside of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of the $7-billion residential, office, retail and hotel project near 
Marina del Rey have been "out in the marketplace" touting the plan to various 
entertainment firms, hoping to attract them to the 1,087-acre site at the base 
of Westchester bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are already dubbing the idea "Playa Vista Studios," although developers 
say there is no official name. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas Helicopters and Hughes Aircraft radar operations now occupy 
the site, but both aerospace firms plan to pull out by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Left behind will be 17 buildings (including the hangar-like structure used to 
build Howard Hughes' famed Spruce Goose) that could be transformed into 
Hollywood sound stages and production offices, according to Nelson Rising, 
senior partner of Maguire Thomas Partners, the developer. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're hearing is there is a tremendous demand for facilities for a full 
range of production activities," Rising said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how this will shake out," he added, but went on to say that part 
of the site is already being used for filming and that 1.5 million square feet 
of space could handle production of feature films, TV sitcoms, commercials and 
live audience shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than mirror a traditional studio and backlot, the developers say Playa 
Vista could one day house an alliance of independent Hollywood production 
companies, craftsmen and vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to happen in one of two ways," Rising said. "Either we will 
gradually accommodate people's needs building by building until we establish 
critical mass, or a group of users will come together and use it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Fueled by a production boom, major studios have earmarked more than $1 billion 
for Los Angeles-area construction to expand or remodel their lots. 
</P>
<P>
 An example is 20th Century Fox, where increased TV and movie production has 
made available space tight. Fox's 53-acre Century City backlot has 18 sound 
stages and the company is spending $20 million upgrading various facilities and 
has plans to build a 1,000-car garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four years ago, when we started rezoning efforts, we thought we could put all 
our L.A.-based activities on our (Century City) lot," said George Vradenburg, 
executive vice president of Fox Inc. "Now, we're not going to be able to fit 
them on the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most studios are expanding movie output," he added. "MGM was in a virtual 
dormant state a year and a half ago. Now, they're planning a pretty full 
output. MGM is coming back to life." 
</P>
<P>
 Vradenburg noted that Fox recently lost its lease on its Channel 11 TV station 
in Hollywood because the building's owners thought there was such a competitive 
market for space among entertainment firms that they could easily find other 
tenants willing to pay more. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Paramount Pictures say the need for sound stages and support 
facilities ebbs and flows. 
</P>
<P>
 This production boom has forced some film and television production firms to 
venture out of the traditional entertainment enclaves of the Westside and San 
Fernando Valley to as far away as Valencia and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Playa Vista officials say their development could consolidate locations for 
many of these smaller firms at a site close to Hollywood's existing creative 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 The master plan for Playa Vista calls for 13,000 residential units and 5 
million square feet of office space over the next 10 to 15 years. The project 
could employ 20,000 people when completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics argue that the Playa Vista project could worsen an already congested 
San Diego Freeway and paralyze companies doing business at nearby Los Angeles 
International Airport. An environmental group called Save Ballona Wetlands, 
which alleges that city officials failed to adequately consider traffic, air 
pollution and other consequences of the proposed development, has filed suit to 
block the first phase of construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The site includes the huge hangar-like building where Hughes' famed Spruce 
Goose "flying boat" was constructed. Known as Building 15, it is 720 long and 
over 70 feet high, Rising said, leaving huge potential for sound stages. 
</P>
<P>
 Another hangar-like structure called Building 17 already has been converted 
into two sound stages by Hollywood Locations, a company that handles filming 
rights to Maguire Thomas properties. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm has turned part of the 450-foot-long structure into a permanent 
courtroom set that was recently used in the Warner Bros. film "Murder in the 
First" starring Christian Slater, Gary Oldman and Kevin Bacon. The set had been 
in Sylmar until the Jan. 17 earthquake struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Studios have reached the point that they're busting out at the seams," said 
Chris Ursitti, co-owner of Hollywood Locations. "A lot of companies are now 
going as far south as Long Beach. Aaron Spelling could be a good candidate (for 
Playa Vista). They took over a couple of warehouses in Valencia."

'LISTEN TO THE LYRICS, BOZO!'

<P>
 "A Date With the Smithereens" features some of the group's most provocative 
work to date. Following sample lyrics from some of the album's key songs, 
songwriter Pat DiNizio's discusses each. "Gotti" 
</P>
<P>
 Good fellas, politicians, what's the difference anyway?  
</P>
<P>
 Gotti is my hero, he's the Robin Hood of present day  
</P>
<P>
 Tell me there's no Mafia, I'll tell you there's a Santa Claus  
</P>
<P>
 And if my name were Gotti, I could make up all of my own laws  
</P>
<P>
 Free John Gotti  
</P>
<P>
 Free John Gotti now  
</P>
<P>
 DiNizio: "The key line of the song is 'Good fellas, politicians, what's the 
difference anyway?' . . . (Reputed mob kingpin and convicted murderer John) 
Gotti was the most flamboyant, interesting character on the scene in New York 
in recent years. He was always compelling reading, to say the least. . . . 
Obviously, the song is supposed to be tongue-in-cheek. 'How dare you advocate 
the release of this man?' Well, listen to the lyrics, bozo!" "Long Way Back 
Again" 
</P>
<P>
 Not hurtin' anyone, that's all she had to say  
</P>
<P>
 I was just havin' fun, they just got in the way  
</P>
<P>
 Did it much matter then, tell me I need to know

SIMPSON CHASE, CAPTURE DRAW HIGH TV RATINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 O.J. Simpson's flight from police and his subsequent capture in front of his 
home last Friday earned bonanza television ratings, attracting almost as many 
viewers locally as last year's brush fires and the 1992 Los Angeles riots, 
according to figures released Monday by station researchers and the A. C. 
Nielsen Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't compare to the riots or fires in terms of danger to people, but it 
was really up there in terms of interest to viewers," said KCBS-TV Channel 2 
General Manager Bill Applegate. "It was a high drama of Homeric proportions." 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 3.4 million households in the Los Angeles-Orange-Ventura county 
area -- or about 68% of the homes that have television -- were tuned to the 
seven major VHF stations between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. as the police pursuit of 
Simpson wound down and ended at his Brentwood residence, said Rozanne 
Englehart, director of research for KTLA-TV Channel 5. 
</P>
<P>
 That hour marked the peak viewing period for the Simpson saga, she said. By 
contrast, about 2.8 million households -- or 56% of the homes with television 
-- were tuned in during the same hour the preceding week. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewership was higher than normal throughout Friday afternoon hours and built 
gradually through the day as the drama surrounding Simpson's disappearance 
unfolded. At 2 p.m., 38% of homes were watching the live coverage. By 5 p.m., 
49% of homes were tuned in, and that increased to 53% at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2 p.m on the previous Friday, 29% of the local households had had their 
televisions on. 
</P>
<P>
 "The audience just built steadily and steadily," Englehart said. "More people 
came home during the day as usual, and interest in the drama grew, so those 
things played together to perk up the ratings." 
</P>
<P>
 But the numbers fell short of two other major local stories of recent years. 
Last year's fires in Laguna Beach and Malibu, which destroyed hundreds of 
homes, drew about 3.5 million viewers between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. on Oct. 27, 
Englehart said. And the first day of the riots on April 29, 1992, drew some 3.7 
million viewers between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m.

BOTH SIDES CHEERED BY JUDGE'S TOLLWAY RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge took the middle ground Monday in the battle over the 
San Joaquin Hills tollway, allowing construction to proceed on the road linking 
it with Interstate 5, but requiring the tollway agency to do additional 
environmental studies, according to attorneys involved in the fracas. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they do anything different than they said they were going to do, the judge 
says they have to do environmental studies," said Mark Rosen, attorney for a 
San Juan Capistrano citizens group fighting the tollway. "As I see it, it's a 
victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Leonard Goldstein lifted a May 31 order halting work on a two-mile 
stretch of Rancho Viejo Road, which the San Joaquin Hills Transportation 
Corridor Agency plans to move east to make way for the tollway interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Save Our San Juan, the citizens group, had sought to block construction, 
arguing that the tollway agency intended to move the frontage road much closer 
to homes than the original plans specified. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday both sides were claiming victory, though neither had yet seen the 
ruling. Copies of the decision are available today.  
</P>
<P>
 Rosen said the ruling points out at least two areas where the tollway agency, 
by its own admission, plans to move the road farther than the scope of the 
original environmental studies. The ruling also directs Rosen to write the 
order that will prohibit construction in those areas until new studies are 
completed, Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically it starts the whole process over," Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mark Stockstill, the tollway agency's public affairs director, said Rosen 
is exaggerating the ruling and that the environmental studies required by the 
judge will not be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not terribly concerned about meeting the conditions set forth," 
Stockstill said. "The order has been lifted. We view that as positive. We're 
confident the corridor will be built as planned." 
</P>
<P>
 Stockstill said the delay caused by the injunction had not hurt the tollway 
project because crews were working on other sections, including other 
tollway-related work in San Juan Capistrano. The injunction temporarily halted 
construction on two miles at the corridor's southern tip, south of Paseo de 
Colinas in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockstill said the ruling allows them to start work on all but the disputed 
portions immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll resume work in that area as soon as possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4.6-mile Laguna Canyon stretch of the tollway recently has been the focus 
of bitter protests. Last week an environmental activist chained himself to a 
bulldozer, and another was arrested in a demonstration that snarled traffic on 
the narrow canyon road. A federal judge issued a temporary injunction halting 
bulldozers while a judicial panel considers the activists' emergency move to 
appeal a lower court decision against them. 
</P>
<P>
 When completed, the 17.2-mile toll road will wind from the Corona Del Mar 
Freeway in Newport Beach through Laguna Niguel and merge with the Interstate 5 
freeway in San Juan Capistrano near Avery Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of the San Juan Capistrano City Council recently voted not to 
challenge the planned tollway interchange in exchange for about $2.5 million in 
promised roadway and other improvements.

CONGRESS TO TACKLE FAA HANDLING OF 757 ISSUE; AVIATION: HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE WILL 
INVESTIGATE WHETHER THE AGENCY IGNORED SAFETY WARNINGS INVOLVING THE AIRCRAFT 
UNTIL AFTER FATAL SANTA ANA CRASH. TURBULENCE FROM THE JETS CAN AFFECT TRAILING 
PLANES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A congressional subcommittee will convene a hearing next month to determine 
whether the Federal Aviation Administration ignored safety warnings involving 
Boeing 757 jetliners until after the deaths of 13 people, federal officials 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying the FAA has a history of not acting until after a tragedy, Rep. Tom 
Lewis (R-Fla.), the ranking Republican on the House subcommittee on technology, 
environment and aviation, said he called for the hearing because he believes 
the FAA may have put the airline industry's well-being before the public's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really frustrated with the FAA over this thing," Lewis said. "I passed 
legislation -- the Catastrophic Failure Prevention Act -- that's supposed to 
require them to look at these kinds of things before they happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "This tombstone technology attitude of the FAA does not seem to want to go 
away," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two crashes, including last December's accident in Santa Ana that killed two 
In-N-Out Burger chain executives, occurred after private aircraft encountered 
"horizontal tornadoes" caused by 757 jetliners. Although aviation experts 
disagree on the degree of the hazard, the 757's unique, fuel-efficient design 
creates windstorms emanating from each wingtip that are more powerful and last 
longer than those made by other aircraft its size. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported earlier this month that the FAA's top scientist, Robert E. 
Machol, had issued warnings on the 757 wake turbulence danger as far back as 
1990. It was that report that prompted Lewis' call for the hearing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional staffers said the hearing, the second federal inquiry on this 
subject to be announced in recent weeks, will focus on why the FAA tarried 
before instituting new safety rules designed to prevent accidents caused by 757 
wake turbulence when its own scientists had called attention to the potential 
danger years ago. Among the FAA's new rules on 757s: an interim requirement 
that smaller planes landing behind 757s stay four miles back on final approach, 
instead of three miles, so pilots can better avoid the wake turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing also will address the larger questions of whether the regulatory 
agency "pays attention" to its scientists on safety recommendations, and 
whether the agency's conflicting twin tasks -- ensuring safety and promoting 
the aviation industry -- would best be split up and handled by separate 
entities, staffers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like the FAA to do what it's supposed to do," said a congressional 
staffer involved in gathering witnesses and evidence for the hearing, 
tentatively scheduled for July 19. "If they don't pay attention to their own 
scientists and research staff, then this might happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 The House subcommittee on technology, environment and aviation is chaired by 
Rep. Tim Valentine (D-North Carolina) who agreed to schedule the hearing at 
Lewis' request. The subcommittee has been instrumental in increasing FAA's 
research budget in recent years -- a point of contention for Lewis, who said 
the agency had "plenty of money" to study the wake turbulence hazard before 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, the FAA has moved cautiously before making policy changes that 
could prove costly to the airline industry. In the case of 757s, the agency had 
resisted efforts to increase separation distances between the popular, 
sleek-bodied jets and trailing aircraft because it could potentially decrease 
the number of flights at the nation's busiest airports. That could mean revenue 
losses for the airline industry, which has battled financial problems in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a terrific conflict of interest between promoting commerce 
and ensuring safety," Lewis said. "For years, I've tried to get the two tasks 
separated and the FAA has been successful in putting that off." 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA has maintained that there was insufficient data to warrant a rule 
change on 757s. However, in May, following the fatal crash in Santa Ana, the 
agency announced a new set of policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Five people were killed on Dec. 15, 1993, as a private jet crashed on final 
approach to John Wayne Airport. Eight people died in a Billings, Mont., crash 
on Dec. 18, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 According to internal FAA documents obtained by The Times, 11 days before the 
1992 accident, Machol, the agency's top scientist at the time, warned FAA 
managers that wake turbulence created by 757 jetliners would cause a 
"catastrophe" if the agency failed to take preventive measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was in 1990 that they knew they had a problem, but they don't create a 
wider separation until after 13 deaths," Lewis said. "I think that's heinous." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena ordered a 
review to determine whether the FAA bungled the handling of the 757 wake 
turbulence problem. Both he and FAA Administrator David R. Hinson expressed 
concern about whether the agency was equipped to identify potential safety 
problems and act on them in a timely fashion. The results of that inquiry, 
which is being conducted jointly by the FAA and the Department of 
Transportation, are scheduled to be released July 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The wake turbulence, created by rapid air movement across the 757's wings, 
poses the greatest hazard during landings and take-offs, when trailing aircraft 
can inadvertently slip below the larger craft's flight path and become 
entangled in a danger zone of hurricane-force winds. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA has parried criticism stemming from the two fatal accidents by saying 
both planes were flying under visual flight rules, which require pilots to bear 
the primary responsibility for maintaining a safe distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, in the wake of the two accidents, several new procedures take effect 
beginning this summer. In addition to the new interim four-mile separation 
rule, the FAA will require air traffic controllers to complete regular wake 
turbulence training and be more cautious when dealing with planes landing 
behind 757s. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency also will educate pilots of 757s on the potential threat their 
aircraft poses to other planes. And it also has begun alerting pilots of 
smaller planes when they are following a 757.

STABBING NEAR PIER CALLED 'ISOLATED'; VIOLENCE: AS HUNTINGTON BEACH BRACES FOR 
FOURTH OF JULY HOLIDAY TROUBLE, A MAN IS WOUNDED AND FOUR ARE ARRESTED. POLICE 
SAY INCIDENT NOT GANG-RELATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Police officials said Monday that violence at the pier over the weekend in 
which a teen-ager was stabbed in the back was an "isolated incident" that they 
hope won't be repeated as the city braces for the busy Fourth of July holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers, out in force to deal with beach-going crowds Sunday, arrested four 
people from Los Angeles County and found the knife believed used in the assault 
atop the roof of a Main Street business, police said. The victim, a 19-year-old 
Garden Grove man, was treated at a local hospital and is expected to make a 
full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, who have taken extra measures to control violence this spring -- 
including curfew sweeps in the downtown -- called the incident unfortunate but 
isolated on a day marked by huge crowds drawn to the beach by picture-perfect 
weather and special events, including the start of a classic car race. The 
assault was not believed to be gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too bad you have these select few who cause trouble," Huntington Beach 
Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg said. "It's unfortunate you have these violent 
situations, but these violent situations -- thank God -- are still isolated." 
</P>
<P>
 In anticipation of the busy spring and summer season, the Police Department 
added extra officers, some on foot and on bikes, and started strict enforcement 
of the city's downtown curfew which prohibits minors from loitering in public 
places between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenberg said crime had been declining downtown since redevelopment started 
about a decade ago, and appears to be declining even more with the curfew 
enforcement and other measures. Fear and anger about crime, especially 
involving the large crowds of young people attracted to the city, reached a 
peak in April when two young men were found shot to death a few blocks away 
from the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 The coming Fourth of July weekend is another concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Fourth of July weekend, police in riot gear arrested 40 men after 
breaking up an unruly roving party during which sofas, cardboard boxes and lawn 
furniture were burned in a huge bonfire. Officials had closed the 3 1/2 miles 
of city beach at dusk over the holiday weekend, which authorities said was 
effective in preventing further trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ralph Bauer said city officials and community groups are working 
together on an action plan to prevent problems this Fourth of July weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol, for example, will handle traffic, freeing up 
more city police officers for patrols, Bauer said. On another front, residents 
and officials have identified potential party houses and trouble spots, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sending the message to the outside world: 'The thugs of the world, 
don't come to Huntington Beach. We're going to nail you,' " Bauer said. "This 
is our town. It is a nice, pleasant, comfortable place. It's a family town." 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer said he's been satisfied by the cooperation among residents, business 
owners and police in dealing with crime problems and added he was pleased that 
police were able to make arrests in the latest violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble Sunday started at about 6 p.m. on the stairs at the base of the 
Huntington Beach Pier when two groups -- one from Los Angeles County, the other 
made up of local surfers -- started arguing, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the argument, one man pulled a knife and stabbed Ingmar Northcott in 
the back, Lt. Clyde Stuart said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects fled in different directions as officers arrived. Police arrested 
the suspects on Main Street and in a beach parking lot off Pacific Coast 
Highway at 6th Street, Stuart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rene Ozuna, 20, of Baldwin Park, and Danny Dominguez, 20, of Azusa, were 
arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, Stuart said. Two 
16-year-old males from the San Gabriel Valley were also being held at Orange 
County Juvenile Hall in connection with the assault. 
</P>
<P>
 About two hours later officers found a 6-inch fixed-blade knife, believed used 
in the stabbing, on the roof of a business on the 100 block of Main Street, 
near the arrest site, Stuart said.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said witnesses told them they saw one of the suspects throw the knife 
up on the roof.

GREENER GOLF PASTURES?; A DIVIDED ANAHEIM CITY COUNCIL TONIGHT WILL CONSIDER 
HANDING OPERATION OF ITS TWO MUNICIPAL COURSES TO A PRIVATE FIRM PROMISING MORE 
REVENUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 For 16 years, Don Lewis has tended the grass at Anaheim Hills Golf Course, 
making sure it has been properly mowed, watered and replanted so golfers 
enjoyed a rolling carpet of green turf. 
</P>
<P>
 "This course used to have the reputation of being a goat pasture," Lewis said 
as he surveyed the grounds Monday. "But now we hear nothing but praise. We 
think it's one of the finest public courses around. We're doing great work 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Anaheim Hills and the city's other golf course, H.G. Dad Miller, are 
played heavily by the public, bringing in nearly $1.5 million a year to the 
city's general fund. But some council members say the two courses, which are 
the only city-owned and -operated courses remaining in Orange County, could be 
more profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the fiercest city debates in years, a divided City Council tonight 
will consider laying off Lewis and the maintenance crews he supervises and 
handing the operations over to a private company, which says it could generate 
more money if it managed the courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of our guys are asking why (the council) is doing this," said Lewis, 
who has been a city employee for 31 years. "They work very hard. It's not like 
the city is losing money. If they want more money, we can do that too. No one 
has told us to." 
</P>
<P>
 After an extensive review of bids from various golf operators, city analysts 
have recommended against contracting the services out to American Golf Corp., 
the most competitive bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 They estimated that the firm would only generate about $2.1 million of 
additional funds over the 20-year contract. That amount is minimal when 
compared to the risk of losing control of the course operations, city staff 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 But in these financially tight times, some politicians find it hard to turn 
down an offer that guarantees more money, no matter how little. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very emotional issue," said Councilman Bob D. Simpson, who is one of 
two councilmen opposed to privatizing the courses. "Very emotional." The three 
other councilmen have voiced support for privatization, but have stopped short 
of endorsing the current proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Ericson, president of the Anaheim Municipal Employees Assn., said the 
council wrongly believes that privatization "is a big panacea" to the city's 
financial problems. "It's the buzzword of the '90s. It's just a political game 
and it's sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Ericson said 25 full-time workers and about 40 part-timers will lose their 
jobs with the city if the course services are privatized. And, she added, the 
city will lose the chance for even greater revenue in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "These golf courses are tremendous assets," she said. "Why do you think 
American Golf wants to run them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Riley, who sits on the city's citizen golf advisory commission, agreed 
that the council should resist the urge to privatize. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too good of a thing to give away," said Riley, as he walked off the 
Anaheim Hills course after shooting an 82. "American Golf does a good job -- 
it's hard to criticize them -- but I think the city can maintain the courses 
better and get more money down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Many golfers at Anaheim Hills were uncertain about what the consequences would 
be if the city turned the operations over to a private company. Some feared 
that the quality of the course would suffer, that course improvements would not 
be made and that green fees would increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to know what will happen," said Jon Davis, a Yorba Linda 
realtor who was practicing his putting Monday. "Anaheim Hills has always been 
in good condition. You'd hate to see that suffer." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tim Scoval, a fireman from Orange, said he thought a private operator 
might cater to the golfers better. 
</P>
<P>
 "They might be a little more customer-oriented," he said. "The city seems to 
be a little slow to make changes." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Guerra, executive vice president of American Golf, said his company has 
committed to making $2 million in course improvements if it is granted the 
contract. Furthermore, he said the quality of the course will be dictated by 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a reason we have grown to the size we are," said Guerra, noting that 
American Golf operates 180 courses. "We continue to meet the expectations of 
our landlords." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the city employees who work at the golf course would be hired by 
American Golf and given opportunities for career advancement. He said, however, 
that he was not sure how the company's wages and benefits compare with the 
city's. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Al Morris, the lead maintenance worker at Dad Miller Golf Course: 
"American Golf is looking out for American Golf; we look out for the city. All 
our profits go back to the city. It's kind of asinine that they're even 
considering this." Tee Off for Two 
</P>
<P>
 The hilly Anaheim Hills Golf Course and the flat H.G. Dad Miller Golf Course 
are Orange County's only remaining city-owned and -operated courses. 
</P>
<P>
 - Tee time: Reservations can be made 24 hours a day via a computerized system 
</P>
<P>
 - Course length: Anaheim Hills, 6,218 yards; Dad Miller, 6,021 yards 
</P>
<P>
 - Green fees * : $16 weekdays, $22 weekends; $11 for weekday twilight games 
(after 3 p.m.), $12 on weekends; $20 for carts

STRAYING JET AIRLINER IS REROUTED TO LAND SAFELY; AVIATION: FAA OFFICIALS SAY 
THAT PILOT MAY HAVE MISTAKEN OTHER GROUND LIGHTING FOR RUNWAY LIGHTS ON 
APPROACH TO JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT, AND THAT INCIDENT POSED NO SAFETY THREAT.

<P>
 A Southwest Airlines jet from San Jose briefly lost its way over Orange County 
late Sunday night before it was rerouted and landed safely at John Wayne 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Aviation Administration officials said the pilot of the Boeing 737 may 
have confused other lighting on the ground with airport runway lights when he 
strayed from the normal path on final approach about 10:20 p.m. The incident 
did not pose a safety threat, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport tower manager Jeff Thorstenson said the Southwest flight carrying 96 
passengers and five crew members was making a visual approach to the airport 
when the jet drifted west of the landing pattern, which generally parallels the 
southbound path of the Costa Mesa Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorstenson said the jet may have descended as low as 900 feet before air 
traffic controllers ordered the pilot to climb higher and make a second 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "What alerted controllers was not so much the altitude but that (the jetliner) 
was further west of the freeway," Thorstenson said. "The approach was not what 
it should have been. It's not something that happens everyday, but it's not a 
big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 On occasion, when pilots on final approach are flying under visual flight 
rules -- using observation rather than depending on instruments -- they may 
lose sight of the runway because of poor weather conditions or because they 
become confused by other lighting on the ground, Thorstenson said. When that 
happens, controllers are there to keep them on track. In-flight instrument 
landing systems are also available. 
</P>
<P>
 "My guess is that it may have been the other lighting on the ground (that 
caused the Sunday night misdirection), but I'd rather not speculate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest Airlines officials said they were not aware of the incident and that 
airline logs of the flight indicated nothing unusual about the 737's landing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This flight was not flagged in any way regarding its landing," Southwest 
spokeswoman Linda Burke Rutherford said. "We don't feel it was serious." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the rerouting by controllers, Rutherford said the flight arrived on 
schedule, at 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest Airlines only began operations in Orange County late last month, but 
Rutherford said it was unlikely that Sunday night's incident could have been 
caused by unfamiliarity with local landing patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 "All pilots are alerted when we begin flying into new airports," Rutherford 
said. "This could have been caused by momentary cloud cover or a confusing 
clutter of lights." 
</P>
<P>
 Although such incidents are not routine, Thorstenson said they are not 
considered serious and generally do not warrant further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorstenson said he listened to a tape recording of the exchange between the 
Southwest pilot and controllers but found "no problem in the cockpit." 
</P>
<P>
 While Thorstenson acknowledged that confusion with other ground lighting could 
have been a problem in this case, he said those instances are generally more 
common at larger metropolitan airports such as Los Angeles International. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport emergency officials said they were not alerted Sunday night to any 
potential safety problems in the vicinity of John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was anything having to do with any kind of possible property loss or 
injury out there, we would have been notified," said Capt. Dan Young of the 
Orange County Fire Department.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; COLLEGE CHILD CARE RECEIVES STATE AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A child care program by the Rancho Santiago Community College District that 
provides meals for the children of students has been named as one of the best 
in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 College officials received a certificate of recognition last week from the 
state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Priscilla McCarty, who ran the program last year, said the district was 
recognized for offering meals that are healthful as well as ethnically diverse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We meet their nutritional needs and we're also meeting the needs of their 
culture," she said. That's important because "kids often only eat what they're 
familiar with." 
</P>
<P>
 McCarty said the program serves about 270 children districtwide. Without the 
child care and meal service, many parents would be unable to attend college. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased" about the award, McCarty said. "All the staff in our 
program do a really nice job, and it's nice to get a pat on the back for going 
above and beyond the call of duty." JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; FARMERS MARKET MAY OPEN AS EARLY AS JULY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange's historic Old Towne district soon will offer a farmers market to 
Sunday morning strollers if the City Council approves the concept at its 
meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
 The market, which would start with 20 to 25 booths, would open on the 100 
block of North Orange Street from 9 a.m. to noon Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 The street would be closed from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. to accommodate set-up and 
cleanup, according to the Orange County Farm Bureau, which would certify the 
sellers and operate the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members will consider the project for a 60-day trial period at their 3 
p.m. meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants in the plaza are delighted at the prospect of more shoppers, said 
Shannon Tucker, president of the Old Towne Preservation Assn. and head of the 
downtown revitalization task force for the Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "More people are using farmers markets," said Tucker, who has been working on 
the project with the farm bureau. "It's a very trendy thing right now to buy 
fresh vegetables and herbs. It would be a real treat for people to go down 
there and see what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents currently travel to farmers markets in Tustin, Costa Mesa or 
Huntington Beach to buy fresh produce, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But while local merchants are heartened by the prospect of the new market, a 
representative of one of the churches in the area said he will object to the 
proposed time and place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no objection to the farmers market," said Bill Teachout, president of 
the Board of Trustees for the First Presbyterian Church of Orange. "My 
objection is to the combination of the farmers market being on a Sunday morning 
within a block of three churches." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachout said he will ask council members to either find another site for the 
market or have it open on a different day of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 If all the permits can be obtained quickly enough, the market could open as 
early as July 1, Tucker said. LESLEY WRIGHT

 An Orange Coast College art historian has been named Orange County's community 
college teacher of the year for the upcoming school year, a college spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irini Vallera-Rickerson is the second member of OCC's faculty in the past two 
years to win the award, which includes a $15,000 cash gift, OCC spokesman Jim 
Carnett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Savage, professor of mathematics, won the award in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Vallera-Rickerson, 42, teaches art history, Carnett said. She has been an OCC 
faculty member for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Athens, Greece, Vallera-Rickerson speaks fluent Italian, German, 
Greek and Spanish as well as English, Carnett said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that Vallera-Rickerson has also taught art history classes at UC 
Irvine, UC Riverside, Saddleback College and the Southern California Institute 
of Architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 Vallera-Rickerson, who lives in Laguna Niguel, has organized campus symposiums 
at OCC on racism, AIDS, architecture around the world and ancient Egyptian 
archeological sites, Carnett said. 
</P>
<P>
 She has also worked with several campus clubs, including the American Indian 
Club, the Gay/Lesbian Club, the AIDS Committee and the Multicultural Committee.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TWO INTERIM COLLEGE PRESIDENTS SELECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two administrators in the North Orange County Community College District have 
been picked to temporarily lead their schools until permanent presidents are 
selected, district officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Armstrong, currently vice president of instruction at Fullerton College, 
will become acting president of the school July 1, district spokeswoman Donna 
Hatchett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elma Clamp, who recently retired as vice president of administrative services 
at Cypress College, will assume the presidency of Cypress College on Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's board of trustees voted to appoint both officials until a 
search is completed for permanent presidents for each college. 
</P>
<P>
 Both schools expect to finish their searches by winter and install presidents 
by Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither official applied for the full-time openings, Hatchett said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton College presidency came open when President Philip Borst, who 
served for 17 years, announced he will retire at the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong, 60, is familiar with the Fullerton campus. She has worked at 
Fullerton College for 32 years, Hatchett said, and has been vice president of 
instruction for the past 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of the University of Redlands, Armstrong joined Fullerton College 
as an English teacher in 1962. Armstrong, of Fullerton, progressed to become 
associate dean of instruction in 1975 and dean of instruction by 1978, Hatchett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cypress College, Clamp will take his second interim term as president. He 
served for a few months as acting president in 1987, Hatchett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom K. Harris Jr., North Orange County's district chancellor, has been serving 
both as chancellor and as Cypress College's president for the past two years. 
Cypress has not had a separate president since Kirk Avery's resignation in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Clamp, of Anaheim, graduated from Anaheim High School in 1952. He attended 
Fullerton College and earned bachelor's and master's degrees in American 
history from Cal State Long Beach. He has been at Cypress College, in various 
administrative posts, for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Clamp, 60, said he looks forward to serving as interim president. "I'm 
enthusiastic," he said. "I think it's a nice way to end my career." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton and Cypress colleges are two of four Orange County colleges and 
universities that are looking to fill top-level leadership positions. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine officials have narrowed their list of candidates for executive vice 
chancellor, the second-highest position at the university, down to four people. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Valley College officials are interviewing 15 candidates for the 
school's open president slot and hope to pick between three and seven finalists 
by Friday, Saddleback Community College District spokeswoman Diane Riopka said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; LIBRARY IS NAMED AFTER VOLUNTEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Ana Unified School District officials have voted to name a local high 
school library after the late Patricia Ann Pleshe, recognizing her 27 years of 
service to students and the community. 
</P>
<P>
 For 19 years, Pleshe, who died in March at age 66 after battling lung cancer, 
was active in parent-teacher associations, served as room mother and 
volunteered at Santiago Elementary School, Willard Intermediate School and 
Santa Ana High School while her children attended those campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 For eight years afterward, she served as a fund raiser for the district's 
Regional Occupational Program. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, she raised more than $300,000 to pay for college and trade 
school scholarships for 381 students, said her husband, Carlos Pleshe. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Pleshe added that he and his family were thrilled by the board's 
decision to name the school after his wife and were especially pleased that the 
library lobby will include a plaque describing her accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tremendous honor. That's fantastic, just the idea that these kids 
can see that one person can really make a difference," he said. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: VILLA PARK; CITY WEIGHS TAPPING $150,000 IN RESERVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's new fiscal year budget, scheduled for a formal vote June 28, calls 
for dipping into about $150,000 of the treasury's $1.5 million in reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 City savings must be tapped if $200,000 of street improvement work is to be 
accomplished in 1994-95, the City Council said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council last week held a special session to discuss the proposed new 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The fiscal document forecasts $1,637,156 in income to the city and $1,788,839 
in expenditures for the fiscal year that begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting, City Manager Fred Maley told the council that despite the 
economic recession, Villa Park's new budget forecasts about $50,000 more in 
income than in costs for normal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 But Maley said that if the city is to proceed with a scheduled capital 
improvement, the reserves must be tapped. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed improvement calls for a $200,000 widening of a narrow section of 
Cerro Villa Drive, east of Loma Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are spending savings," said Maley. "There's no doubt about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Joseph S. Barsa said he thought the city should delay the widening 
of Cerro Villa Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that could be put off," he said. "We can't deficit spend 
indefinitely." 
</P>
<P>
 Barsa added that he is afraid the state Legislature in 1995 "is really going 
to hit on our (city) revenues." Barsa noted that in the past the Legislature 
has taken away money from the cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Others on the council said they also dislike the prospect of tapping the 
city's fiscal reserves. But they said the proposed $200,000 in street work 
should remain in the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The street project can be canceled later in the year if more money problems 
arise, the council majority said. 
</P>
<P>
 In discussing the proposed budget, the council added an item that calls for 
$2,160 for police helicopter service during 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
 The flights would be provided by a new consortium of helicopters from cities 
that already have them, along with the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park's $2,160 cost would pay for 18 helicopter flights during the year.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; WATER DISTRICT VOTES 5% RATE INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents can expect to pay an average of 55 cents extra on their monthly 
water bills because of a rate increase approved by the Irvine Ranch Water 
District's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new rate structure, the cost for 100 cubic feet (or 748 gallons) of 
water will increase by 5%, from 61 cents to 64 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 An average household's monthly water bill will rise from $22.50 to $23.05, 
including service and sewer charges that total $12.80. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Ron Young said the district is passing along fee hikes imposed 
by its two suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California raised its rates by 7%, 
and the Orange County Water District increased its rates by 17%, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine district was able to absorb some of the suppliers' increases by 
using money saved during a management efficiency program. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we were able to do is look at our staff and look for ways to reorganize 
departments and realign our work force," Young said. "It made a more efficient 
operation." 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine board also approved a modest increase in reclaimed water rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is scheduled to vote on a $82.5-million capital projects budget at 
its meeting on Monday. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; COMMUNITY GALLERY TO HOLD QUILT SHOW

<TEXT>
<P>
 An art display titled "Quilts in All Sizes" is being shown at the Cypress 
Community Gallery through July 8. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 handmade quilts are on display. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each quilt is a piece of art," said Nancy Bruns, recreation coordinator for 
the city. "No two quilts are alike. Sometimes themes are involved in a quilt 
pattern, such as a 'friendship quilt.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Quilt-making involves use of patterns, themes and colors, all of which become 
distinctive art forms, Bruns said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Art comes in many forms," she said. "Art doesn't always have to be framed, 
such as a painting or watercolor." 
</P>
<P>
 The gallery, at 5700 Orange Ave., is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays. BILL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; DISASTER RELIEF CENTER REOPENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire relief center that officially closed Friday reopened at the same 
location Monday after the state's Office of Emergency Services decided the 
community still needed the help, a center spokeswoman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Community Disaster Recovery and Preparedness Center, which reportedly has 
served about 1,000 residents, was established after the October firestorm, 
initially to aid fire victims and later to help the city prepare for possible 
future disasters, including fire, floods or earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Center workers, who had insisted their work was not done here, received word 
late Friday that they had been granted the stay, spokeswoman Diane Turner said. 
But since the paperwork already had been processed to close the center at the 
Boat Canyon shopping center, workers arrived Monday to find their furniture 
carted away and the phones disconnected, problems they expect to resolve this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the workers borrowed chairs and a telephone Monday from the 
community-based Laguna Fire Relief Coalition, which has an office next door. 
"It was quite a shock to find out the phones were disconnected," Turner said. 
"But we're working through it all, and we're going to still be here." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the center will remain in the current location for now but will 
probably move to another office eventually. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the four staff members are continuing to work on ongoing 
projects, including helping homeowners' associations in disaster preparations 
and planning community activities to commemorate the one-year anniversary of 
the Oct. 27 blaze, which damaged or destroyed more than 400 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The relief office, at 664 N. Coast Highway, is open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
Monday through Friday. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CEREMONY TO LAUD PROJECT 'GRADUATES' 
</P>

<P>
 Three months after Gina Webber gave birth to a son in the summer of 1989, her 
marriage ended suddenly and she became a single parent. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber left Tulsa, Okla., where she was living, and moved back here, where she 
grew up and graduated from high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to find work, she sank deeper into debt. But Webber didn't want any 
government handouts. She refused to go on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a pride thing," she said. "I felt I needed to work as hard as I could 
to beat the system." 
</P>
<P>
 The former Huntington Beach High School cheerleader put her skills to work and 
opened a small dance studio to help pay the bills. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 She needed help -- just like many other single parents who find themselves in 
need of housing, employment, child care, job training and higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber turned to Project Self-Sufficiency, a city-sponsored program that began 
in 1985 -- the only one of its kind in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Through public and private support, the program gives low-income single 
parents the chance to become financially independent -- to get off the welfare 
payroll and other government assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber received housing assistance so she could use her money for college 
expenses. She also received food, clothing and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Webber, 28, whose son, Brett, is now almost 5, is proud of her 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, she earned a bachelor's degree from Chapman University and plans to 
teach history. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of her achievements, Webber, along with 30 other women who have been 
involved in the program and have become self-sufficient, will be recognized in 
a ceremony from 5 to 7 tonight at the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan M. Edwards, director of the program, said the "graduates" have received 
registered nursing degrees, two- and four-year college degrees and certificates 
in vocational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards said 95 women and their children currently are in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Shortt, 28, the mother of two sons, Joshua, 12, and James, 6, believed 
she had no other choice but to go on welfare after her divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 Because she wanted to make something of herself, Shortt became involved in the 
program, which helped her get an apartment and gave her the financial and 
emotional support she needed to go to college. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, she graduated from Golden West College and has been accepted into 
the college's nursing program, starting in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl C. Yrigoyen, 41, a 1990 Project Self-Sufficiency graduate and the 
mother of 10-year-old Lorie Ann, has cleaned up her credit, has received a 
nursing degree, works at a local hospital and has bought a home. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving her husband when her daughter was an infant and going on 
welfare, "I was bound and determined to do something to support us," she 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 The program gave her back her self-esteem and "showed me that I could do it. . 
. . I never thought I'd be a property owner -- ever." 
</P>
<P>
 The other women also said that they couldn't have achieved their goals without 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a blessing for me and my son. . . . I have my life back," Webber 
said. "I'm educated, and I can give back to my community by teaching children." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortt added that the program has changed her outlook on life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, I never thought about making goals," she said. "But I've been able to 
be a role model for my children and show them that when you set a goal, you can 
achieve it. Now both of my sons want to go to college." DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; CITY TO WEIGH TIME LIMIT ON COMMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A resolution that would limit public comment to a 45-minute period at City 
Council meetings will be considered by the council tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Frank Benest is recommending time limits to assure the council 
has enough time to conduct city business during meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the time limit, which could be extended at the mayor's 
discretion, the resolution would continue the city's policy of confining an 
individual speaker's comments to five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately following the public comment part of council meetings would be an 
opportunity for the city manager to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, the city staff had proposed a resolution calling for two 30-minute 
periods of public comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents reacted angrily to the original proposal, calling it an infringement 
on their First Amendment rights to free speech and an attempt to stifle 
negative comments about council actions. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council meetings, which are shown live on local cable television, are 
often marked by rancorous exchanges between residents and elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The main sore spot is how the city is handling the 50-acre downtown 
redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
 Common complaints about redevelopment include the city's use of condemnation 
to seize property and the bulldozing of historic buildings, including the Red 
Lantern Theater, where Judy Garland once performed. ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; CITY BUDGET PROPOSES 15.5% SPENDING HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposed revisions to the fiscal 1994-95 budget would increase the city's 
total spending for the upcoming fiscal year by 15.5%, from $34.4 million to 
$47.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The revisions, which will be voted on by the City Council tonight, include an 
increase of $10 million for capital improvements projects, such as a new 
$2.5-million gymnasium planned for Hurless Barton Park and the proposed 
$4-million Eastside Sports Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The city adopted a $35.9-million spending plan for the new fiscal year last 
June as part of a two-year budget. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the increase for capital improvements, the council will 
consider increasing general fund spending by $334,500 to $14.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The general fund is used to finance the daily operating expenses of the city, 
such as police and fire service, salaries and programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the general fund hike is a 1.2% increase in the city's contract 
with the Brea Police Department, from $5,781,300 to $5,851,300, and a 1.2% 
cost-of-living salary adjustment for all city employees except management. The 
cost of the raise will total $43,000. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER $23.1-MILLION BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council tonight will consider a spending plan for fiscal year 1994-95 
that would cut six positions, including one police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget would also require a transfer of more than $1.5 million from the 
utility tax fund to the city's general fund to pay for day-to-day operation of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed $23.1-million budget is up 8.8% over the budget for the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 However, with revenue expected to be only $20.8 million, the city is 
considering transferring money from the utility tax fund to help make up the 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The elimination of a police officer reduces the department to 50 officers, 
down from 54 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Four park maintenance worker positions will be cut under the proposed budget, 
and a technician position will be reduced from full to part time. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one employee, a park maintenance worker, will be affected by the cuts 
because the other positions will be eliminated through attrition. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the total savings to the city from the cuts will be 
$200,000. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

DECISION ON BUILDING BAN PUT OFF; LANDSLIDE: OFFICIALS STILL STUDYING WHETHER 
TO SEEK EXTENDED MORATORIUM IN FIRE-DAMAGED LAGUNA AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A recommendation that the City Council today extend a building moratorium for 
another 10 months in one fire-battered community was pulled late Monday and may 
be considered next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The city staff recommendation had shocked and angered some fire victims in the 
targeted Mystic Hills community, where a previous 45-day building moratorium is 
scheduled to expire June 28. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said he hasn't decided yet whether he will 
recommend extending the moratorium at the council's meeting next Tuesday. He 
said he decided to pull the staff's recommendation for a 10-month moratorium 
after a call from Mayor Ann Christoph. 
</P>
<P>
 The moratorium was imposed after geologists concluded that an ancient 
landslide may lie under Mystic Hills. Earlier in the day, Mystic Hills 
residents had reacted bitterly to the possibility that their building plans 
could be further stalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it stinks," said Ron Retterer, a fire victim who said that he has 
been denied a building permit since the ancient landslide discovery. "I've 
waited eight months, and they're still screwing around and I'm getting very 
upset. It's costing me money not building. I get so mad every time I talk about 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Still on the agenda today is a staff recommendation that the council 
appropriate an additional $20,000 to further study the Temple Hills area, 
another fire-damaged community which may have similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Early studies of that neighborhood by two geological firms show a suspected 
landslide there may be smaller and more shallow than previously feared. 
</P>
<P>
 The October firestorm incinerated 366 homes in and around Laguna Beach and 
damaged dozens more. Mystic Hills, a neighborhood sprawled in the hills above 
City Hall, was the hardest hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents there were later stunned when city-hired geologists revealed that 
two dozen Mystic Hills properties -- including 13 rendered vacant by the fire 
-- were sitting atop an ancient landslide. In all, the report said, 38 lots 
could be directly or indirectly affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptical that the landslide poses any real danger or even exists, residents 
demanded last month that the city obtain a third geological opinion. That 
report is expected to be the subject of the special council meeting next 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 At that meeting, the council could either lift or extend the building ban, 
Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say a key element to lifting the building ban is the 
development of an assessment district to generate the $1 million needed to 
steady the hillside. That subject will also be addressed at the June 28 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he had favored implementing the ban during tonight's meeting, Frank 
said late Monday that after further consideration, he realized it made more 
sense to wait. Once the findings of the latest geological report are released 
and residents decide whether to form an assessment district, it will be easier 
to determine whether a further building ban is needed, Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional 10 1/2-month ban was proposed because that is the only time 
frame offered by state law for a moratorium extension, Frank said. Even if an 
extension is approved next week, Frank said, it will likely be lifted much 
sooner, probably within two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Mystic Hills residents, however, were not particularly soothed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make me feel any better," Retterer said. "We should have been 
allowed to build about three months ago."

SEWAGE SPILL CLOSES MILE OF ALISO BEACH; ENVIRONMENT: A PIPELINE RUPTURE 
RELEASED 16,000 GALLONS OF PARTIALLY TREATED SLUDGE INTO A CREEK NEAR THE 
STRAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A one-mile stretch of Aliso Beach was ordered closed Monday after 16,000 
gallons of partially treated sewage spilled into nearby Aliso Creek, an Orange 
County Environmental Management Agency official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's undigested sludge and we're just as concerned as if it were untreated 
sewage," said Larry W. Honeybourne, a spokesman for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 An underground 4-inch, pressurized pipeline operated by the South Coast Water 
District broke near Alicia Parkway and Aliso Creek Road, spilling the material 
for 9 1/2 hours, the district said. The break in the main was reported by a 
cyclist riding along the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once it was discovered, we closed the pipe to eliminate any more sludge from 
going through the pipe and spilling," said Michael Dunbar, South Coast Water 
District's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunbar said sludge is sewage that has gone through the district's waste water 
treatment process and has high concentrations of solid materials. It has the 
consistency of a "very thin, fine mud," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although partially treated, Honeybourne said the county ordered the beach 
closed because of concern for disease-carrying microbes that could come in 
contact with people swimming at the public beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost summertime, and most of the schools I know are out," Honeybourne 
said. "And, although it's treated waste, the pathogenic microbes are still 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 The county took samples of ocean and creek water Monday, but results will not 
be known for at least three days. Until then, the beach will remain closed. 
Signs warning of the potential health threat were posted Monday, Honeybourne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will continue to sample on a daily basis," Honeybourne said. 
</P>
<P>
 The closure extends a half-mile in either direction from Aliso Creek's mouth, 
about 100 yards north of Aliso Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roughly, the area is from Camel Point on the south to the boundary of 
Treasure Island Mobile Home Park on the north," Honeybourne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunbar said the hole in the broken pipe was about the size of a thumb. Water 
district crews Monday patched the pipe, located three feet underground. 
</P>
<P>
 A crew cleaned up the paved roadway. Dirt near the pipeline break will be 
excavated by a backhoe once it is dry, and it will be taken by truck to BKK 
Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 The pipe is used to transfer treated waste to a regional treatment facility 
about six miles from the water district, Dunbar said. At the second facility, 
sludge is treated again and then trucked to a compost facility. Some of the 
treated material is also trucked to a general landfill, he said.

SUSPICIOUS FIRE FORCES EVACUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A suspicious fire spewing a cloud of orange smoke erupted in a Christmas tree 
farm late Monday, forcing the evacuation of four firefighters from the scene 
and about 30 people from nearby homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire apparently started shortly after 9 p.m. in a shed in the center of 
the Lyon Christmas Tree Farm under the power lines on the east side of Magnolia 
Avenue, Orange County Fire Department spokesman Dan Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 When firefighters began spraying the flames, a cloud of orange smoke appeared, 
and the county's hazardous materials units were called, Young said. Four 
firefighters who were exposed to the cloud were decontaminated and are under 
observation, he said. They were not hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's suspicious right now," Young said. "This place has been closed up from 
Sept. 26. There's no reason for the shed to burn. It's some kind of pesticide 
or agricultural chemicals." 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters and police evacuated about 30 people from 10 homes, and residents 
of homes within a four-block radius were told to stay in their homes with the 
windows and doors shut, Young said.

 An unidentified man and a 23-year-old cocktail waitress were found shot to 
death on the floor of the woman's Santa Ana apartment Monday, more than six 
hours after neighbors reportedly heard the shots, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Police Lt. Robert Helton said a resident of the apartment complex in 
the 1100 block of West Civic Center Drive apparently heard the shots at about 5 
a.m., but the apartment manager was not told until about 11:30 a.m., when she 
called police. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we entered the apartment, it was obvious to us they had been dead for 
some time," Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the woman, whose identity was being withheld until relatives could be 
notified, and the man had been shot numerous times in the chest, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Helton said police have no witnesses or motives for the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no sign of forced entry nor were the woman's belongings disturbed, 
he said.

 The City Council was moving closer to a decision late Monday night on a 
proposal by the Automobile Club of Southern California to expand its complex on 
Fairview Road to nearly a million square acres. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate came less than a week after Auto Club officials threatened to move 
out of the city if they were not allowed to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto Club Vice President Peter McDonald said the project "benefits the city 
and the Auto Club . . . (which) brings positive cash flow to the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Like several other hearings on the subject, Monday's meeting brought more than 
100 people to the council chambers. Most of the speakers expressed support for 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't understand all the bickering," resident Ron Hall said. "We need 
businesses in Southern California. We can't let them leave."  
</P>
<P>
 Some residents opposed the project for fear it would increase traffic and open 
the door for other large commercial developments. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials and Auto Club representatives Monday hailed the project, 
saying it will bring thousands of jobs to Costa Mesa and improve the local 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto Club officials have said it would allow them to double the number of 
employees at the Costa Mesa complex from 1,135 to 2,509, making it the city's 
largest employer. 
</P>
<P>
 And an independent analysis found that the expansion would generate $150,000 
in new annual fees for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would allow Auto Club to more than double the size of its 
467,000-square-foot complex on its 30-acre site at 3333 Fairview Road. The new 
offices would be used as a processing center for the Auto Club's various 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The size of the project required that the city amend its general plan. 
Residents said such an amendment would set a precedent that other companies 
could use when seeking approval for ambitious projects that exceed the city's 
planning regulations.

RESIDENTS PLEAD FOR MORE YOUTH PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to a crowd of residents who filled a church auditorium Monday 
night, Mayor Tom Daly promised he would urge the City Council to grant their 
plea for more youth programs to combat violence in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of a grass-roots organization called Orange County Congregation 
Community Organization complained that gang violence has increased sharply in 
recent years, while the city has made deep cuts in its Parks and Recreation 
Department programs. 
</P>
<P>
 They asked for old programs to be restored and new ones introduced to give 
low-income children an alternative to drugs and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a real deadly, terrible situation," said the Rev. John Lenihan, 
pastor of St. Boniface Catholic Church, where the meeting was held. In the last 
year, he said, he had buried 10 young parishioners who had died because of drug 
overdoses or shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Steve Mather, another leader of the church-based organization that 
claims more than 50,000 county families as members, drew enthusiastic applause 
from the audience of about 350 people when he asked for their support of an 
action plan. That plan, which he said was drafted after an extensive survey and 
54 meetings, includes these measures: 
</P>
<P>
 * Creation of a teen center for after school and on weekends; 
</P>
<P>
 * Creation of a computer lab; 
</P>
<P>
 * Expansion of youth programs at the George Washington Community Center; 
</P>
<P>
 * Development of a "sweat equity" program that would enable children to get 
discounts on parks and recreation fees by doing community work; 
</P>
<P>
 * Development of an industry-driven apprenticeship program to prepare youths 
to enter the work force; 
</P>
<P>
 * Expansion of the city's summer jobs program. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said he would encourage the City Council to "use all the ideas in one 
shape or form" from "our plan for the future of the city."  
</P>
<P>
 He suggested that people who want more youth programs show up at the City 
Council meeting tonight, which will focus on projects to be funded in next 
year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Congregation Community Organization, an interfaith group 
representing 15 churches countywide, already has a track record for attracting 
government attention and support. In May, it presented the mayor of Santa Ana 
and the city's public school superintendent with a plan to help the youth of 
Santa Ana.  
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,500 Santa Ana residents packed into St. Anne Catholic Church to 
show their approval of the proposal, which was designed to reduce gang violence 
and provide jobs, security and after-school programs to Santa Ana youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young said he endorsed all of the group's goals, 
although he noted that some of the suggestions could not be implemented without 
funding from the federal government or private industry and others would 
require more planning meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the organization is trying to focus more attention and resources on the 
needs of Anaheim's youth. Its leaders said they have held 54 meetings with 
experts in education, law enforcement and crime prevention to get at the root 
of the city's youth problems.

HOST FAMILIES SOUGHT FOR FRENCH TEENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Host families are sought for several French teen-age students who will visit 
Orange County this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Education Forum is looking for at least 13 temporary homes 
for stays of up to a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are between ages 14 and 18, ready to practice their English, indulge in 
some shopping and, most importantly, make a friend in America," said Lila 
Brumbeck, coordinator of the county chapter of the International Education 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Families willing to host male students are especially needed, Brumbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty much the long-waiting students (for a host family) are boys," she 
said. "Families by far are more apt to host a girl than a boy, so despite their 
strong records in academics, sports and art, boys wait for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is true across the board for teen-agers from all countries: Brazil, 
Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany and other places." 
</P>
<P>
 The students speak English and have their own spending money and insurance. 
Those interested in participating in the student exchange program, call (714) 
362-0810.

D.A. MOUNTS MEDIA DRIVE TO SHAPE OPINION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The task facing Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti in the O.J. Simpson case is daunting 
and unparalleled: He must try to win murder convictions against an American 
sports legend well-known to the public for his charm and grace. 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely, if ever, has a murder suspect generated the outpouring of concern that 
has been expressed for Simpson. From freeway overpasses to radio talk shows, 
members of the public have voiced their support and disbelief that Simpson -- a 
welcome visitor to their living rooms for a generation via the airwaves -- 
could be capable of such a coldblooded crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The football hall of famer's tremendous popularity poses an unprecedented 
challenge to the district attorney, one that is forcing Garcetti to take 
extraordinary measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of last Friday's bizarre nationally televised spectacle of crowds 
cheering the beloved football superstar as he led police on a low-speed pursuit 
across Southern California freeways, Garcetti took to the airwaves himself, 
launching an unusual public relations blitzkrieg on national TV news programs. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's "Nightline." "CBS Evening News." "NBC Nightly News." "Today Show." Even 
a special nighttime edition of "Good Morning America." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti, in an interview Monday with The Times, said that he recognizes that 
public perception is important in high-profile cases, and that he, like defense 
lawyers, must use the media to shape popular opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti insisted that his primary goal during his interviews has been to 
stress the pressing issue of domestic violence. But he acknowledged that his 
high-profile initiative has also served as a means of meeting the unique 
challenge of the Simpson case by trying to focus attention on the homicide 
victims, Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman, rather than the retired 
football star. 
</P>
<P>
 "After seeing how the media was responding, how some members of the community 
were responding to the situation," Garcetti said, he decided "to remind people 
that the real tragedy, the real sympathy should be extended to the two people 
who were killed and to the children of Nicole Simpson." 
</P>
<P>
 "When you say well-known," Garcetti said, referring to O.J. Simpson, "you mean 
superficially well-known. It is a daunting challenge perhaps (to try him), but 
I do have faith in the criminal justice system." 
</P>
<P>
 By undertaking his public relations offensive, Garcetti risks a backlash that 
could create even more sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti's public comments, which included an ultimately incorrect prediction 
on the "Today Show" that defense attorney Robert Shapiro would seek a 
postponement of Simpson's arraignment, have drawn fire from Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling Garcetti's public discussion of the case unconscionable, Shapiro said 
that "to make any comments before an arraignment undermines the system of fair 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts contacted Monday said Garcetti could alienate members of the 
public who might feel that Simpson is being persecuted rather than prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fine line," said Loyola School of Law professor Laurie Levenson, 
"because the defense will say the district attorney's office is unfairly trying 
the case in the press and will also claim that it is doing so because it does 
not have enough evidence to win in the courtroom." 
</P>
<P>
 But experts, including Levenson, agreed Monday that Garcetti has little choice 
in his public relations gambit, given the recent track record of the office 
that he took over from Ira Reiner last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before the Simpson case, several high-profile actions filed by the Los 
Angeles County district attorney's office have ended in acquittals or 
mistrials, including the McMartin child molestation case, the Rodney King 
beating case and the Menendez murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts said that if Erik and Lyle Menendez, who admitted killing their 
parents, could win the sympathy of jurors, just consider the possible reaction 
to Simpson. With that in mind, the experts said, Garcetti's high profile may be 
the only way to stay on a level playing field in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 "People reacted last week as if they were at a public sports event and O.J. 
Simpson was an athlete in a game," said Southwestern University School of Law 
professor Robert Pugsley. "If a jury can get hung up on the Menendez brothers, 
a jury can get hung up on a national hero." 
</P>
<P>
 In his round of national appearances, Garcetti has made several statements 
that could help deflate Simpson's longtime image. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a man who was fleeing, and that fact alone, in our mind, establishes 
a consciousness of guilt," Garcetti told Ted Koppel on ABC's "Nightline" 
shortly after Simpson was taken into custody at his Brentwood mansion Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to a question Sunday from TV political talk show panelist George 
Will, the prosecutor also weighed in on Simpson's potential legal strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it's not going to shock me if we see an O.J. Simpson, sometime down the 
road -- and it could happen very soon, it could happen months from now -- say, 
'OK, I did do it, but I'm not responsible,' " he told Will on "This Week With 
David Brinkley." "We've seen it in Menendez. It's going to be a likely defense 
here, I believe, once the evidence is reviewed by the lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 On "CBS Evening News" Saturday, Garcetti linked the issue of spousal abuse 
directly to the Simpson case. In that appearance, he roundly criticized a 
municipal judge who allowed Simpson to pick his own psychiatrist and receive 
counseling by phone after pleading no contest to beating his then-wife Nicole 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge in that case, Ronald Schoenberg, "kissed . . . off" the case, 
Garcetti told CBS anchor Bob Schieffer. "It was almost saying, 'OK. Look, walk 
out of here. Nothing's going to happen to you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. David Conn, assigned by Garcetti to help prosecute the 
case, said Monday that the office's high profile is only a matter of responding 
to the extraordinary public interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel that we've taken much of an offense. I think we've been very 
fair and neutral. We're simply responding to concerns of the media and we 
haven't tried to exploit the situation in any way." Making His Point 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some examples of the public comments made by Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti 
since the arrest of O.J. Simpson in the slayings of Nicole Simpson and Ronald 
Lyle Goldman: 
</P>
<P>
 * Friday on "Nightline" 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a man who was fleeing, and that fact alone, in our mind, establishes 
a consciousness of guilt." 
</P>
<P>
 * Saturday on "CBS Evening News" 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, the judge in (the 1989 domestic violence case involving O.J. 
Simpson) kissed it off. I don't know why, I don't know the judge, but there 
certainly was not a meaningful sentence. In fact, it was almost saying, 'OK. 
Look, walk out of here. Nothing's going to happen to you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * Sunday on "This Week With David Brinkley" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it's not going to shock me if we see an O.J. Simpson, sometime down the 
road -- and it could happen very soon, it could happen months from now -- say, 
'OK, I did do it, but I'm not responsible.' We've seen it in Menendez. It's 
going to be a likely defense here, I believe, once the evidence is reviewed by 
the lawyers. We don't know. It's speculation on my part, but we'll be waiting." 
</P>
<P>
 * Sunday on "NBC Nightly News" 
</P>
<P>
 "We in the Los Angeles County district attorney's office unfortunately are 
filing one domestic violence homicide case every nine days. That should shock 
everyone."

BIOLOGY, POLITICS POSE HUGE BARRIERS TO SAVING PANDAS; WILDLIFE: FOCUS IS ON 
SAN DIEGO ZOO. THE SPECIES' MATING HABITS AND OFFICIALS' SUSPICION STYMIE 
CAPTIVE BREEDING PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 On one thing all sides agree: The giant panda, that childlike, overstuffed 
animal with the haunting black circles around its eyes, must be rescued from 
the ravages of modernity in its native China. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, agreement tends to break down. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the most popular animal ever brought to American zoos has all but 
disappeared from public view. Only one panda remains in an American zoo, 
Hsing-Hsing in the National Zoo in Washington, and it is unclear whether the 
federal government will again allow zoos to borrow pandas from the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons lie in a complicated struggle to save the panda that is equal 
parts science and politics, international cooperation and geopolitical 
suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the dispute is the renowned San Diego Zoo, whose thwarted bid 
to borrow two pandas from the Chinese for exhibition and breeding purposes has 
heightened the international debate about how, or even whether, the panda can 
be salvaged as a species. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists in China and the United States have found it difficult to 
compensate for the panda's hit-or-miss approach to procreation, in which the 
male and female live apart all year long and the female is in heat only one day 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 But the political hurdles in saving the panda are even more daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Chinese bureaucracies with responsibility for the panda have been at odds. 
American zoos have clamored for the black-and-white, bear-like animals, but the 
U.S. government in recent years has given mixed messages, first encouraging 
their importation, then putting up roadblocks and, finally, halting importation 
altogether last December. 
</P>
<P>
 The Geneva-based World Wildlife Fund, a leader in the save-the-panda movement 
for 25 years, has urged even tighter restrictions on imports than those in the 
endangered species law. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's leading authority on panda preservation has written a blistering 
book suggesting that preservation efforts in China are doomed because of 
ineptitude and greed and that American zoos, including San Diego, are mainly 
interested in exploiting the panda to boost attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the monetary stakes for American zoos in the panda debate are 
enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 In an increasingly competitive market for the consumer entertainment dollar, 
pandas mean big bucks. A dozen American zoos, from Seattle to Atlanta, as well 
as the Busch Gardens theme park in Tampa, Fla., are interested in borrowing 
pandas and are willing to pay millions of dollars to the Chinese to get them. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile the number of pandas in the wild has dwindled to fewer than 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 For 3 million years, untold numbers of pandas roamed freely in the mountains 
of Central China. But in the past half-century pandas have been pushed to the 
brink of extinction by China's burgeoning population and economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the forest that is the panda's natural habitat has been cleared for 
timber and farming. The bamboo that is the panda's main source of nutrition 
suffered a natural but catastrophic die-off in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 As if economic and natural forces were not bad enough, poachers have killed 
pandas for their pelts, which can fetch $10,000 on the Asian black market. The 
Chinese reportedly have executed six poachers but the illegal traffic 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all this depressing news about the panda's chances for survival, 
scientists at the San Diego Zoo, acclaimed in the zoological world for their 
work in preserving other endangered species, thought last year that they had 
found a way to make a major contribution toward saving the pandas. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego Zoo and Chinese officials, who have cooperated for two decades in 
saving several species, struck a deal for two young pandas to be sent to the 
zoo for three years. The zoo would give $3 million to the Chinese government to 
pay for the preservation of panda habitat. If the female gave birth, the ante 
would be upped by $600,000 per cub. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists at the zoo's Center for Reproduction of Endangered Species believe 
they have found a hormone test to predict the female's one-day estrus, a hair 
test to determine virility and rutting ability among male pandas, and 
behavioral methods copied from cheetahs to get male and female pandas 
interested in mating. 
</P>
<P>
 If they are right, the results could be a major boon to the panda breeding 
centers run by the Chinese government, where the reproductive record has been 
spotty. Confident of approval by the U.S. government, the San Diego Zoo spent 
nearly $1 million for a special panda enclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 But in September the U.S. Department of the Interior's Fish & Wildlife Service 
rejected the zoo's application to import Shun-Shun and Shi-Shi, both of whom 
had been captured for medical reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said sending pandas to San Diego could lead 
the Chinese to round up pandas as a kind of cash crop to peddle to other zoos. 
</P>
<P>
 The rejection signaled a shift of federal policy. During the Reagan and Bush 
administrations, several applications to import pandas were approved. When the 
Fish & Wildlife Service balked at approving a loan permit for the zoo in 
Columbus, Ohio, President Bush intervened on the zoo's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt's rejection was an unexpected and embarrassing turn of events for the 
San Diego Zoo: to be accused of doing something that could hasten the 
extinction of an animal species beloved by mankind. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were turned down, I was flabbergasted," said Douglas Myers, executive 
director of the San Diego Zoological Society. "Our whole reason for being is to 
help preserve species." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego Zoo's application had two powerful opponents: the World Wildlife 
Fund, whose president is Britain's Prince Philip, and noted zoological writer 
George Schaller, author of the 1993 book "The Last Panda." 
</P>
<P>
 Schaller, who conducted the first panda census for the World Wildlife Fund, 
refers acidly to Chinese collaboration with American zoos as "rent-a-panda" 
programs and concludes that panda preservation is a failure. 
</P>
<P>
 The fallout from the San Diego rejection and the Schaller book has been 
enormous. The zoo has resubmitted its application with added scientific 
evidence it hopes will allay Babbitt's fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this time good science is recognized and politics are put aside," said 
Myers. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the female Shun-Shun, the zoo is now asking for Bai Yung, a 
captive-born female from the preserve in Wolong. There had been controversy 
about the reasons behind Shun-Shun's capture. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the panda pot has been sweetened. Along with the $1 million a year for 
preservation of panda habitat, the zoo will also provide $200,000 a year in 
scientific assistance. The agreement could be in effect for up to 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months after rejecting the San Diego application, the Fish & Wildlife 
Service stopped reviewing new applications for the importation of pandas until 
a new panda policy is developed. Babbitt, citing the Schaller book, has taken a 
personal hand in shaping that policy, a process that is still under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the American Assn. of Zoological Parks and Aquariums has formulated 
a Species Survival Plan. The trade association's plan would have zoos acting in 
concert to import pandas for breeding purposes rather than having individual 
zoos cut separate deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Importing pandas strictly for exhibition would be ended. All imports would be 
part of a breeding program; only pandas born in captivity in China would be 
eligible to be loaned to American zoos. 
</P>
<P>
 By acting as a consortium, zoos could share information on the panda's 
behavior in captivity and possibly solve the mystery of why many captive pandas 
seem to lose interest in copulation. Sperm from males with a proven record of 
potency could be collected for artificial insemination. For natural methods, 
finicky females might be provided a selection of mates. 
</P>
<P>
 The zoo association plan is dependent on the Chinese allowing for greater 
accountability of where zoo funds earmarked for habitat preservation, such as 
the millions promised by San Diego, are being spent. The Chinese say it will 
cost $50 million to buy enough forest land to ensure the species' survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaller and the World Wildlife Fund have expressed concern that money already 
sent to China by U.S. zoos for habitat preservation has been squandered or 
spent on non-panda projects. Panda policy in China is handled by overlapping 
and sometimes warring ministries of forestry and construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting the Chinese to permit outside auditing is a touchy diplomatic matter. 
A high-level mission from the American Assn. of Zoological Parks and Aquariums 
left earlier this month for China. 
</P>
<P>
 When the group returns, it hopes to announce a breakthrough agreement for 
accountability. The goal is to influence Babbitt and the Fish & Wildlife 
Service to allow pandas to be brought to the United States for breeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether such an agreement can be reached, or whether it will placate the 
concerns of the World Wildlife Fund, is unclear. The organization funded the 
first census in the 1970s and has helped the Chinese manage some of their 
preservation centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the Chinese plans for timber extraction, panda preservation areas, 
and hotels near those preservation areas are scary," said World Wildlife Fund 
official Ginette Himley. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, pandas have been the most popular attraction ever brought to 
American zoos since the first visiting panda, Su-Lin, was brought to Chicago in 
1937 amid hoopla fit for royalty. 
</P>
<P>
 When the San Diego Zoo brought Yuan-Yuan and Basi for 200 days in 1987 and 
1988, attendance soared and the zoo made an estimated $4 million from tickets, 
souvenirs and concessions. A new word was coined to describe the sensation: 
pandamonium.  
</P>
<P>
 The zoos in Toledo and Columbus wanted pandas so badly in the 1980s that they 
fought in court to get them. The Columbus zoo risked censure by the zoo 
association. 
</P>
<P>
 For two decades the nation watched the reproductive drama of Hsing-Hsing and 
Ling-Ling, given to the National Zoo after President Nixon's historic visit to 
China in 1972. The deaths of all five offspring and the demise of the female 
Ling-Ling were cause for national disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "In what other species are all captives known by name?" wrote Schaller. "What 
other species has its every birth, illness, reluctant romance and death

 The public's fascination with the panda has baffled scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have suggested that the panda's teddy-bear appearance triggers a hormonal 
response and latent maternal feelings. Others have theorized the attraction 
comes from the fact that adult pandas, which can grow to 300 pounds and five 
feet in length, retain the basic appearance of cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're both exotic and cuddly," suggested the wildlife fund's Himley, whose 
group uses the panda as its logo and sells panda trinkets. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason for the infatuation, the Chinese in the 1970s began to 
understand the political uses of the panda. Pandas were loaned to zoos in 
Japan, the United States, England, France, Spain, Mexico and North Korea. 
Pandas were loaned to the Los Angeles Zoo during the 1984 Olympics, but since 
the late 1980s the flow of pandas to America has slowed to a trickle because of 
misgivings by the Fish & Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The pent-up demand for pandas is enormous. Oliver Ryder, geneticist at the San 
Diego Zoo, calls this the "charismatic mega-vertebrate" phenomenon and thinks 
it can be harnessed to rally public support to save other species. 
</P>
<P>
 "People may not care about the spotted salamander, the El Segundo blue 
butterfly or the desert pupfish," Ryder said. "But they care about the panda." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryder did a study he hopes refutes the idea that granting a panda permit would 
encourage the Chinese to begin capturing pandas for export. His figures 
indicate that even when China was exporting pandas freely, the number of 
captures was unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
 While the San Diego import application is being reviewed -- no decision is 
expected this summer -- other zoos are watching. "Everyone concerned with 
pandas is watching what happens to San Diego," said Himley. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego Zoo officials have suggested that Schaller's pessimism may be based 
on old information, noting that his data was collected in the early 1980s and 
that cooperation has improved. 
</P>
<P>
 "China is a different country than when George was there," said animal 
behavior expert Don Lindburg. "From the standpoint of captive breeding, if 
we're ever going to do anything with the panda, now is the time." 
</P>
<P>
 As it waits for the pandas that may never arrive, the San Diego Zoo has put a 
sign outside the empty enclosure asking for the public to remain patient. A toy 
panda bear sits as a forlorn presence in a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, a zoo official got an unexpected opportunity to speak to President 
Clinton about pandas. While vacationing in Coronado, the President, his wife, 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, and their daughter, Chelsea, went on a VIP tour of the 
zoo's Wild Animal Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The president got a close-up view of a Somali wild ass, an endangered species 
that has been bred at the Wild Animal Park. He asked zoo official Jim Dolan 
about the zoo's efforts with other rare animals. 
</P>
<P>
 One animal seemed foremost on the President's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you have your pandas yet?" Clinton asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolan was more than willing to provide details.

SIMPSON ENTERS PLEA OF NOT GUILTY IN DOUBLE MURDER; CRIME: HE LOOKS HAGGARD IN 
COURT AS HE ANSWERS TO CHARGES OF SLAYING HIS EX-WIFE AND HER FRIEND. THE 
DEFENSE IS GRANTED ACCESS TO EVIDENCE IN THE CASE. 
</P>

<P>
 Looking dazed and haggard, O.J. Simpson pleaded not guilty Monday to charges 
that he murdered his ex-wife and a friend of hers, and his lawyer later said 
the football hall of famer was under medication and "very, very depressed, 
exceedingly emotional." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson faltered near the beginning of the arraignment in Los Angeles 
Municipal Court, failing to answer when Judge Patti Jo McKay asked his name and 
wincing when the charge of murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, was 
read to him. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the brief session, Simpson, dressed in a dark suit but without a 
tie, belt or shoelaces -- officials will not allow him anything that could be 
used in a suicide attempt -- stood with his head cocked to one side. He blinked 
slowly and gazed around the courtroom, sighing deeply several times as lawyers 
discussed schedules for turning over evidence and other details of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyer, Robert L. Shapiro, asked for access to coroner's reports, 
police reports and other case documents, some of which are completed and others 
that are being compiled. Shapiro did not ask for bail, a request that would 
almost certainly have been denied because of the charges in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors raised no objections to Shapiro's requests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people are happy to share all the evidence in this case," said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark, the prosecutor assigned to the case. "Every piece of 
evidence will be shared with the defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro has hired experts to review evidence, particularly the findings of the 
Los Angeles County coroner. Late Monday, the attorney and one of those experts, 
pathologist Michael Baden, spent about 50 minutes at the coroner's office to 
collect and review reports related to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, Judge McKay set June 30 as a preliminary hearing date. Shapiro later 
said that he and Simpson welcomed the early opportunity to hear sworn testimony 
from witnesses in a public forum. Such a hearing, Shapiro said, would allow a 
public airing of the evidence and would subject witnesses to vigorous 
cross-examination in a case rife with speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether that will happen, however, remains doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors already are presenting evidence to a grand jury. If that body 
returns an indictment against Simpson in the murders, it would preclude the 
need for a preliminary hearing. Grand juries meet in secret, and witnesses 
cannot bring their attorneys, two facts that make such proceedings appealing to 
prosecutors trying to build a case. 
</P>
<P>
 While the hearings are closed, California grand juries generally disclose 
transcripts in cases in which the targets are indicted, so the testimony 
probably will not remain secret for long if Simpson is indicted. 
</P>
<P>
 As the case shifted from police to the courtroom, lawyers on both sides spent 
Monday jockeying for advantage, holding a pair of news conferences on opposite 
sides of town. Addressing the media in the lobby of his Century City office 
building, Shapiro reiterated his contention Monday that Simpson was home when 
the murders were committed, but he also declined to rule out pursuing an 
insanity defense for his client. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the present time I have not discussed at any great length the facts of the 
case" with Simpson, said Shapiro, adding that he is contacting lawyers across 
the country in order to assemble a trial team headed by himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about an insanity defense, Shapiro responded: "Every possible defense 
has to be considered by any trial lawyer, and I certainly would reserve all 
possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro also said his hurried reading of police reports given to him in court 
suggested that there was not conclusive scientific evidence linking his client 
to the murders. But Shapiro conceded that he had not read the entire document, 
and had not yet seen any of the evidence in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has stated in his letter that he is innocent," Shapiro said. "The charges 
that were read are charges that are going to be contested." 
</P>
<P>
 Blood samples taken from the scene of the crime showed a blood type that 
matches Simpson's, according to sources familiar with the case. Preliminary DNA 
tests have been conducted on those and other blood samples -- including ones 
taken from Simpson's driveway, as well as clothes, shoes and other items taken 
from his home. Prosecutors would not comment on the results of the preliminary 
DNA testing, but sources familiar with the case said those tests continue to 
link Simpson to the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary DNA tests generally are not admissible in court, but final results 
are expected to be available in the coming weeks. Those tests are far more 
precise than the ones that have been conducted so far, and could play a 
significant role in the case against Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 At his news conference, Shapiro acknowledged that Simpson had two cuts on one 
hand, a relatively small one to his index finger and a larger one near his 
wrist, which the athlete said occurred when he broke a glass in his Chicago 
hotel room upon hearing news of his ex-wife's death. Simpson also has several 
scratches on his hands and wrists, Shapiro said, describing them as "paper 
cuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors, meanwhile, met with reporters at the courthouse after the 
arraignment and said they were confident that they already have enough evidence 
to convict Simpson of the brutal double murder, which occurred June 12 outside 
Nicole Brown Simpson's Brentwood condominium. The blood-soaked bodies of 
Simpson, 35, and her friend, Ronald Lyle Goldman, 25, were found shortly after 
12 a.m. June 13, touching off a murder investigation whose developments are 
being followed around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was premeditated murder," Clark said. "It was done with deliberation and 
premeditation. That is precisely what he is charged with because that is what 
we will prove." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said prosecutors have discounted any notion that the killings were an 
act of passion, or, as one reporter put it, "a spontaneous meltdown." She also 
said there were no plans to charge anyone else in the slayings. "Mr. Simpson is 
charged alone," Clark said, "because he is the sole murderer." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's failure to surrender Friday and a subsequent car chase broadcast on 
live television sent publicity surrounding the case to new heights and produced 
an outpouring of public opinion, much of it apparently favorable to Simspon. As 
he and close friend Al Cowlings were pursued by police through Orange and Los 
Angeles counties, hundreds of supporters cheered from overpasses and more 
gathered in front of his Brentwood home, where Simpson eventually gave himself 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson had drafted an apparent suicide note and had a gun during that chase, 
which Shapiro said began because his client was heading for his ex-wife's grave 
so that he could kill himself there. Police sources said Monday that they 
recovered the gun from Cowlings' Ford Bronco and that it was loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have acknowledged that Simpson's popularity may make it difficult 
to find a jury willing to convict him. But they said Monday that they are 
convinced that when the facts of the case are known, support for the world 
renowned athlete-actor will wither. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course there is some sympathy for Mr. Simpson because he is a public 
figure," said Deputy Dist. Atty. David Conn, who is assisting Clark. "But as 
time goes on I think the public is going to look a little more closely at the 
brutality of this crime and I think there will be a better perspective on the 
manner in which this case was handled." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Simpson's throat was slashed so deeply that the wound exposed her 
spinal column, according to sources familiar with the case. Goldman was stabbed 
numerous times with the same weapon, which Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti has 
described as a "substantial knife." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources have said that Goldman's injuries suggested a fierce struggle with his 
assailant. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators still are searching for the murder weapon, and police returned 
Monday to a Chicago field where they searched with metal detectors last week. A 
gas station attendant has told police that he saw a man resembling Simpson in 
that field last week, during the time that Simpson was briefly in Chicago 
before returning to Los Angeles to face questioning in connection with the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Monday, police dogs in Chicago found a bag containing a pair of socks in 
the wooded area just south of the O'Hare-Plaza Hotel where Simpson stayed 
briefly on June 13. They also found a pair of sunglasses. A Los Angeles 
detective at the scene said the items would have to dry out before they could 
be examined more thoroughly and preserved as possible evidence.

HIGH COURT LETS ENGLISH-ONLY JOB RULES STAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court cleared the way Monday for employers to enforce English-only 
rules for their bilingual workers. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 7-2 vote, the justices refused to hear an appeal of a ruling in a San 
Francisco case that said requiring workers to speak English on the job does not 
violate federal anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, lawyers for the Clinton Administration had urged the high court 
to reverse that decision, calling it "an issue of great national importance to 
national origin minorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1970, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has told 
companies that they may not enforce English-only rules, except in the rare case 
where it was judged to be a "business necessity." 
</P>
<P>
 But last year, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals threw out that guideline. 
It concluded that where workers can speak both English and Spanish, requiring 
them to converse only in English at work may be an "inconvenience for some" but 
it "does not impose a burden significant enough to amount to the denial of 
equal opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court referred only to bilingual workers. It would amount to 
discrimination, the court indicated, to impose an English-only requirement on 
employees who could not speak English. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Supreme Court agreed to decide whether states can impose term 
limits on their members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the court has allowed states to set term limits for the members 
of state legislatures. But some lower courts have ruled that the Constitution 
does not allow for such limits on members of the U.S. Senate and House of 
Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasing numbers of employers have sought to enforce rules requiring their 
workers to speak English, partly to improve communication on the job but also 
to reduce friction among workers. The owner of the San Francisco 
meat-processing plant whose case reached the high court said that he imposed 
the English-only rule after other workers complained that two Latino employees 
were insulting them in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 After the high court's action Monday, English-only workplace rules are legal 
as a matter of federal law in California and in the eight other West Coast 
states. The law is less clear elsewhere. Since the court did not issue a formal 
ruling, its decision is not binding outside the region of the 9th Circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 EEOC attorney Jennifer S. Goldstein said, however, that her agency will 
continue to adhere to its guideline that frowns on English-only requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think (the guideline) is still correct. We view this as a matter of 
discrimination," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission said it has 120 cases before it in which the agency is fighting 
English-only rules. If EEOC lawyers can win a ruling in another appeals court 
that rejects an employer's English-only policy, the high court may be called on 
to revisit the issue later. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal dispute arises from an interpretation of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964. That law makes it illegal for employers "to discriminate against any 
individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of 
employment because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex or national 
origin." 
</P>
<P>
 In its 1970 guideline, the EEOC said that an English-only rule discriminated 
against "national origin minority employees" because it took away a "condition 
or privilege of employment enjoyed by other employees: the right to converse in 
a familiar language with which they are most comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration lawyers noted that this legal interpretation has been followed 
consistently since then in the lower courts and has won the implicit 
endorsement of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 But recently, the Supreme Court and some conservative lower courts have 
rejected longstanding liberal interpretations of federal civil rights laws. In 
its 2-1 ruling last year, the 9th Circuit Court judges said that "nothing in 
the plain language of the (1964) law supports EEOC's English-only rule." 
</P>
<P>
 The case that reached the high court began in 1990 at a small meat-packing 
plant in South San Francisco. Kenneth Bertelson, the company president, had 
received complaints from a black and an Asian who said they had overheard 
racist insults spoken in Spanish by two Latino workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Bertelson issued a new rule: "Only English will be spoken in 
connection with work. During lunch, breaks and employees' own time, they are 
obviously free to speak Spanish if they wish." 
</P>
<P>
 Priscilla Garcia, who had worked on the assembly line for 19 years, filed a 
suit contending that the new rule violated federal civil rights laws. 
Initially, a federal judge in San Francisco declared the rule illegal. However, 
last July, the 9th Circuit Court not only upheld the company's rule but threw 
out the longstanding EEOC policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices' vote left intact the decision in the case (Garcia vs. Spun Steak 
Co., 93-1222). Dissenting were Justices Harry A. Blackmun and Sandra Day 
O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
 The term-limits case tests a popular reform that has swept through 15 states, 
including California, since 1990. But there has remained considerable doubt 
whether the Constitution allows the states to impose new restrictions on who 
can be elected to the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 A new Arkansas law would limit U.S. senators to two six-year terms, while 
members of the House would be limited to three two-year terms. But earlier this 
year, the Arkansas Supreme Court declared those limits unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court will hear the case (U.S. Term Limits vs. Thornton, 93-1456), 
during the fall and issue a ruling next year. 
</P>
<P>
 In other actions, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 * Made it harder for some coal miners and longshoremen or their heirs to 
collect benefits for their disability or deaths. In deciding claims involving 
these workers where the evidence is equally balanced, the Labor Department has 
tilted toward the workers. But in a 6-3 vote (Director of OWCP vs. Greenwich 
Collieries, 93-744), the justices rejected this policy as a matter of federal 
law and said that workers must prove their cases. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ruled that the federal law protecting airline and railway workers does not 
prevent them from suing under state law if they are wrongfully fired. The 9-0 
ruling in the case (Hawaiian Airlines vs. Norris, 92-2058), clears the way for 
a suit filed by an airline mechanic who contended that he was fired for 
refusing to cover up the fact that a plane was not ready to fly. The company 
had contended that the case had to go to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 * Refused to hear an appeal from the first man sentenced to death under the 
new federal law aimed at drug kingpins (Chandler vs. United States, 93-1033). 
In 1991, David R. Chandler, who ran a marijuana-selling ring, was convicted of 
paying $500 for the murder of a potential informer. He was sentenced to death 
under a 1988 federal law. Six others have since received federal death 
sentences. Since 1962, no person has been executed under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 * COURT SAYS NO DICE: Indian casinos lose bid to use a video gaming machine. 
A3 
</P>
<P>
 * BETTER BUSINESS: Companies find benefits in employing workers who speak two 
or more languages. D1

CLINTON HINTS HE MAY BEND ON HEALTH REFORM; LEGISLATION: BUT PRESIDENT APPEARS 
UNWILLING TO YIELD ON UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. HEALTH ALLIANCES MAY BE ABANDONED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton gave new signals of flexibility Monday on many major 
elements of his health reform plan, but aides warned that on the key question 
of health coverage for all Americans, the President increasingly appears headed 
for a collision in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admit that we needed to make some changes in our original proposal," 
Clinton said during a televised interview on NBC's "Today" show. "I always said 
we would. We want it now to be less bureaucratic and less regulatory." 
</P>
<P>
 Aides said that statement reflects Clinton's willingness to abandon several 
controversial elements of his own plan, including the mandatory insurance 
purchasing pools, or "health alliances," to which many businesses had objected. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, while Clinton repeated his insistence that any health plan 
provide coverage for all Americans, he couched his statement in language aides 
said was designed to encompass at least some potential compromises that have 
been the subject of continued behind-the-scenes negotiations between the White 
House and leading members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "The important thing is that we should not walk away from this Congress 
without a commitment to cover everyone," Clinton said. That reference to a 
"commitment" for coverage differs from Clinton's earlier language, which 
insisted Congress guarantee coverage to all Americans in one step. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress could possibly provide a commitment through one of several proposals 
to mandate universal coverage only after voluntary efforts had been given a 
try, officials said. Such non-mandatory mechanisms, known as "triggers," have 
circulated on Capitol Hill for weeks, but Clinton has not specifically endorsed 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that Clinton could support some of the trigger proposals, but 
that in private meetings at the White House, including a session of top 
advisers over the weekend, he had taken a firm stance against any compromises 
that would not, by some specific date, guarantee health coverage for all 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The line over here is getting pretty hard now," said one senior 
Administration official. "As a result, over on the Senate Finance Committee, 
they don't really feel he's going with them now." 
</P>
<P>
 Finance Committee Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) said Sunday that a 
bill providing coverage for all Americans by mandating that all companies 
purchase insurance for their employees could not pass Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's insistence on having precisely what Moynihan says cannot be 
delivered sets up a potential collision that, White House officials fear, could 
end with a defeat of health reform efforts for this Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials are now largely pinning their chances on progress on 
the House, where Republican tactics of refusing to consider compromises appear 
to have backfired and solidified Democratic support. The Administration's hope 
is that if the House moves forward with a bill, the movement somehow will break 
the current Senate deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope for a change of heart among at least some of the conservative 
Democrats and moderate Republicans who say they want to see health reform pass 
but do not support a requirement that all businesses insure their workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the compromise proposals that members of the moderate bloc have 
supported "just don't work" on a technical level, said one senior Clinton 
adviser, expressing the hope that legislators will adopt that conclusion as 
they continue to analyze rival bills. But, the official conceded, as of now, 
Clinton and his aides do not see a clear path to a Senate majority. 
</P>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton reflected that view Monday in a meeting with 
groups that have supported the Administration on health care, warning them that 
the proposal is now in severe peril. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials have been critical of their allies, feeling that they 
have concentrated too much on the Clinton plan provisions that they dislike at 
the expense of the broader effort to achieve a health care bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hoped people would say, 'I like the overall bill, but I just want to fix 
one part.' Instead, all we've been hearing is, 'But,' " said one senior 
Administration aide. 
</P>
<P>
 As they try to rally their supporters, Administration officials find 
themselves caught between two conflicting impulses in Congress. One the one 
hand, moderate Republicans and conservative Democrats have been probing for 
signs of compromise. As Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.), the senior Republican on 
the Finance Committee put it in a speech: "If the President does not wink or 
nod, then I fear we're deadlocked." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, Clinton's allies in Congress fear that the 
President, in his search for votes, may lose the support of the liberals who 
have given the greatest support to health care reform so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "On this question of universal coverage, I don't think we should play semantic 
games," said Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.). 
</P>
<P>
 Caught between those two sentiments, Clinton has issued a series of carefully 
nuanced statements, even as his aides insisted that any bill must include some 
form of universal coverage. "The signal he is sending is that he is four-square 
behind universal coverage," said Clinton adviser George Stephanopoulos. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Monday, officials launched a major push to remind legislators of the 
dangers faced by middle-class voters if Congress attempts only piecemeal 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate speeches, budget director Leon E. Panetta and Health and Human 
Services Secretary Donna Shalala presented the argument that halfway reforms 
will backfire, increasing costs to the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 Without universal coverage, any attempt to control costs will collapse, 
Panetta said. And without cost controls, he added, both the government's budget 
and the finances of many companies will hemorrhage. 
</P>
<P>
 Shalala released new statistics on the number of Americans without insurance 
and urged Congress to take "bold steps." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a lot of talk in recent weeks about some kind of incremental 
approach to reform," Shalala said, using a word that Moynihan had used to 
describe what he thought could pass the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 If universal coverage does not pass, she warned, middle-class families with 
insurance will continue to be overcharged to cover the costs of the uninsured 
-- costing the average family $600 over the next five years and steadily 
increasing the percentage of Americans with no insurance at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of uninsured Americans jumped from 12.5% in 1980 to 17.2% in 
1992, according to figures released by the government, Shalala said. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics, contained in the department's annual report on the nation's 
health, show that the majority of the uninsured are employed either full time 
or part time, and that in 1992, 48.8% of those without insurance earned between 
$14,000 and $50,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are hard-working, middle-class Americans who get up and go to work 
every day," Shalala said. "Yet every day, they must live without the security 
of health insurance."

STATE'S UNITARY TAX UPHELD BY SUPREME COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court on Monday upheld California's use of the so-called unitary 
taxing method for multinational corporations, a decision that spares the state 
from paying refunds that could have amounted to nearly $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 7-2 ruling came a year after the state essentially abandoned the 
taxing approach, which had caused irritation in foreign capitals. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the complexity of the legal arguments that have surrounded unitary 
taxation for more than a decade, the Supreme Court came to a surprisingly 
simple conclusion: Congress has the power to limit the tax policies of the 50 
states, not the President or the federal courts. Congress could outlaw the 
unitary tax but has refused to do so, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the justices pointed out, the Constitution gives Congress the authority "to 
regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states." Over two 
centuries, much has been read into that short phrase, including the notion that 
discrimination against interstate or foreign commerce is forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
 But when faced with the question of whether California could calculate its 
state taxes on multinational firms by a different method than is used 
elsewhere, the justices fell back on the original language of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 "We leave it to Congress -- whose voice, in this area, is the nation's -- to 
evaluate whether the national interest is best served by tax uniformity, or 
state autonomy," wrote Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the court. "This court 
has no constitutional authority to make the policy judgments essential to 
regulating foreign commerce and conducting foreign affairs." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling spares Gov. Pete Wilson and the state Legislature a major headache. 
If the ruling had gone the other way and the unitary tax had been struck down, 
firms that operate both in California and abroad could have sought refunds 
dating back into the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling was also a victory of sorts for the Clinton Administration. During 
his 1992 campaign, then-candidate Bill Clinton promised to take a 
"pro-California" approach in the pending litigation over unitary taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of previous Republican administrations had sided with the 
multinational firms in urging the courts to invalidate California's policy as 
disruptive to international trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Sherman, chairman of the state Franchise Tax Board, had lobbied Clinton 
on the issue and in January of this year the Administration's lawyers urged the 
Supreme Court to uphold California's policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Most states and nations, including the U.S. government, calculate taxes based 
on what is called the separate-accounting method. The local branches of a 
multinational firm are treated as a separate company. For example, under this 
approach, the California operations of a Japanese auto maker would be treated 
as a distinct company and taxed based on the profits reported by this 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 But California's tax officials had argued that the approach allows for 
accounting tricks that hide profits. The foreign auto maker can inflate the 
cost of a finished car shipped to its California subsidiary. This can allow the 
subsidiary to report no profits earned in California. 
</P>
<P>
 To combat such tax sheltering, California officials adopted the so-called 
unitary approach under which a multinational firm is treated as a single 
business. The state gathers data on the percentage of the firm's payroll, sales 
and property that are in California. For example, if 4% of a foreign firm's 
payroll, sales and property are in California, the state then assumed 4% of its 
profits were earned in California. That amount was then subject to state taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 But European and Asian officials complained that the unitary approach can be 
unfair because payroll costs are high and property is expensive in California. 
This inflates the state's share of profits, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 These complaints found a receptive ear among officials of the Ronald Reagan 
Administration during the 1980s. Under pressure from Washington, the state 
Legislature in 1986 agreed to allow multinational firms to opt out and use 
instead the separate-accounting method. 
</P>
<P>
 However, they charged a fee to pay for the state's extra costs of reviewing 
the tax returns. Last year, believing the unitary method was hurting 
California's business climate, the Legislature essentially repealed the taxing 
method. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this action, the Supreme Court announced last year it would hear 
appeals from British-owned Barclays Bank as an example of a foreign firm with a 
California subsidiary. It also considered a second appeal from New York-based 
Colgate-Palmolive Co. as an example of a domestic firm that operates in the 
state and overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the state Franchise Tax Board estimated it could face refunds of up 
$4 billion if the court ruled against California in both cases. But recently, 
it revised that estimate downward to between $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Clarence Thomas dissented in the case 
(Barclays Bank vs. California, 92-1384).

BROWN OFFERS RIVAL BUDGET, DOESN'T RELY ON U.S. FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Attacking Gov. Pete Wilson's state spending plan as irresponsible, Treasurer 
Kathleen Brown on Monday proposed an alternative she said would balance the 
budget without relying on the federal government to reimburse California for 
the cost of serving illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the Democratic nominee for governor, proposed a combination of welfare 
cuts, narrowly targeted tax increases and reductions in aid to counties in 
order to repay a five-year note she previously suggested as the best way to 
restructure the state's ongoing debt and return the government to firm fiscal 
footing. 
</P>
<P>
 The treasurer -- in her most comprehensive statement on the budget to date -- 
ruled out her support for further spending cuts or fee increases in higher 
education, and echoed Wilson's call for a 10% boost in prison funding in the 
coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This approach to government is one that's based upon the notion that everyone 
is going to participate in helping the economic recovery of California," Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Wilson campaign spokesman immediately denounced Brown's borrowing plan as 
illegal and her tax increases as foolish. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, speaking to political reporters over breakfast in Los Angeles, also 
said the boos that drowned out Wilson at the Rose Bowl as he tried to address 
the opening ceremonies of the World Cup soccer tournament Saturday were a 
reflection of "divisive" tactics he has used in targeting illegal immigrants as 
a major source of California's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Pete Wilson has done is stoke the fires and the fears that people feel 
about the issue," Brown said. "He takes what is a tinderbox in this state and 
almost lights it." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Brown's comments, however, focused on the state budget, which is 
roughly $4 billion out of balance, with the start of the next fiscal year less 
than two weeks away. The Legislature is considering Wilson's $57.3-billion 
proposed budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The plans offered by Brown and Wilson differ in three key respects -- 
immigration funds, taxes and deficits. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said she agrees with Wilson that the federal government should reimburse 
California for the cost of serving immigrants. But she said it would be 
irresponsible to pass a budget and a borrowing plan that rely on a huge new 
federal bailout in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson had demanded $2.3 billion in immigration funds from Washington and 
proposed a budget in January that assumed the state would receive the full 
amount. Last week, the governor lowered his federal funds estimate for the 
coming year to about $760 million but said he still expected $2.8 billion the 
year after next. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, in contrast, would expect only $300 million in federal immigration 
funds the first year and $600 million a year after that. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's proposal, she said, would create "a house of cards that is bound to 
collapse, if not just after the November elections, shortly thereafter." 
</P>
<P>
 On taxes, Wilson opposes any increase and wants to allow a personal income tax 
surcharge on upper-income wage earners to expire on schedule at the end of 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown would extend the tax surcharge, and she advocates another $200 million 
in tax increases, which she describes as closing loopholes. Among other things, 
she would end tax deductions for lobbying expenses, country club dues and some 
moving costs. She would eliminate the sales tax exemption for printed 
advertisement material, or, in her words, "junk mail." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also wants to withhold taxes from independent contractors the same way 
they are taken from wage earners, which experts believe would cut down on 
cheating. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Wilson and Brown would borrow to help retire the state's ongoing deficit, 
but in different ways. Wilson would borrow $1 billion and pay off the loan 
within two years, relying on the increased federal funds he is anticipating to 
help the state pay the tab. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown would borrow as much as $3 billion, but pay it off over five years. 
Instead of banking on the federal funds, she has proposed long-term cuts and 
revenue increases that would bring the budget into balance even if Washington 
fails to come through. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson maintains that any borrowing not repaid within two years would 
violate a state constitutional provision against incurring bonded indebtedness 
without a vote of the people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kathleen Brown wants to raise taxes, break the law by selling bonds without 
voter approval, run a five-year deficit and, for good measure, let the federal 
government off the hook for the illegal immigration money they owe California," 
said Dan Schnur, Wilson's campaign spokesman. "We disagree." 
</P>
<P>
 But behind the rhetorical clashes, Brown's first detailed budget proposal 
illustrates the few options left in Sacramento, as she endorsed a number of 
Wilson's proposals even as she tries to separate herself from his goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, for example, criticized Wilson for enacting budgets that hurt the poor 
and said she would "spread the pain." But she backed his proposals to eliminate 
the renters tax credit and cut county health programs by $285 million. She 
suggested a 5% reduction in welfare grants -- less severe than Wilson's 
proposal but deeper than Democrats in the Legislature have so far offered to 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
 On local government, Brown said she opposes any "major cuts" in city and 
county budgets, which have been hit hard by Wilson's recent spending plans. But 
back-up material provided by her campaign said she endorsed the governor's call 
for taking $500 million in local government property tax revenue in the coming 
year.

FLOCKED TO THE SANDINISTA-LED NATION IN THE '80S. NOW, EMBARRASSING SCANDALS 
PUSH THE NEW GOVERNMENT TO CRACK DOWN ON UNWANTED FOREIGNERS.

<P>
 Even now, with its Italian chef "Guido" on the lam, the popular Magica Roma 
restaurant hardly seems to be a hotbed of international intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
 Diners come and go at a leisurely pace, and the cozy eatery is still the best 
place in town for pasta. Never mind that Guido was a veteran of the Red Brigade 
terrorist organization and a fugitive wanted in the 1978 murder of former 
Italian Prime Minister Aldo Moro. 
</P>
<P>
 Guido has taken a break from his guise as successful restaurateur and is in 
hiding. But his exposure late last year unleashed a scandal still reverberating 
in a Nicaragua that grapples daily with its polarizing past of revolution, 
counterrevolution and war. 
</P>
<P>
 From radical leftists and terrorists to starry-eyed pacifists, thousands of 
people from all over the world descended on Nicaragua during the 1980s, the 
decade of Sandinista rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The idealists believed that they were joining a revolutionary experiment. The 
international fugitives were seeking a haven where Sandinista authorities, 
themselves embroiled in battle with U.S.-backed Contra rebels, shared tips on 
urban warfare and supplied jobs, homes and new identities. Many of the 
revolutionaries joined in the fight against the Contras, and many obtained 
Nicaraguan citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a series of embarrassing incidents that revealed the presence of 
people like Guido, the center-right government that vanquished the Sandinista 
regime at the polls is trying to figure out how to crack down on unwanted 
foreigners and root out the revolutionaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandinistas say the campaign by President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro to 
cancel foreigners' citizenship and deport suspected terrorists is a witch hunt 
aimed at pleasing other governments, which in turn will give aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamorro, worried about her government's image in post-Sandinista Nicaragua, 
says it must safeguard its own national security by ridding the country of 
violent criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreigners themselves have mixed reactions. Some, such as Guido, vow to 
fight any effort to deport them. Others are fed up with the whole mess, 
disenchanted with the current politics of Nicaragua and plan to leave, finally 
forced to recognize the end of an era. 
</P>
<P>
 "People feel like they're in limbo," said Moises Arana Cantero, a former 
Sandinista diplomat in Spain who organized a support group for the foreigners. 
"There's a certain amount of anxiety. People don't know quite what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy is one of many tests the Chamorro government has faced as it 
tries to exert authority over the Sandinistas, whose influence and legacy 
remain powerful long after their formal role in government ended. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sandinista President Daniel Ortega lost -- unexpectedly -- to Chamorro in 
1990 elections, many of the radicals who had enjoyed Sandinista protection 
hoped that they could continue to live in Nicaragua, confident of their 
Sandinista-supplied covers and unwilling to face the law in their home 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks after the election but before Chamorro assumed office, Sandinista 
authorities hurriedly granted citizenship to 990 foreign nationals, including 
92 Spaniards, 56 Jordanians, 20 Palestinians, 94 Guatemalans and 510 
Salvadorans, according to government records. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who had used Sandinista Nicaragua as a sanctuary worked directly 
for the Interior Ministry run by intelligence czar Tomas Borge. The foreign 
radicals exchanged weapons training and used Nicaragua as a base of operations, 
running spy networks and plotting guerrilla missions, according to former 
Sandinista officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a beautiful time," said Sergio Buschmann, a Chilean arms smuggler and 
drama teacher who lived in Nicaragua sporadically after March, 1980. "In the 
morning we'd film a TV program . . . and in the afternoon we'd have militia 
training." 
</P>
<P>
 Buschmann, 51, has been living in Managua as the Chilean government tries, for 
the fifth time, to extradite him for his role in what he claims was the largest 
arms-smuggling operation by Latin American revolutionaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The guns and rocket launchers, Buschmann says with pride, were used in a 1986 
assassination attempt on Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the dictator who ruled Chile 
from 1973 until 1990. Pinochet was unharmed, but five of his bodyguards were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 A founding member of Chile's Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front guerrilla 
movement, Buschmann also spent considerable time in Chilean prisons during the 
1970s and '80s, having been captured during his clandestine sabotage missions. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nicaragua, he worked with the Sandinista Culture Ministry, gave acting 
classes and formed a theater troupe with Salvadoran guerrillas that toured 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 And he joined the Sandinista People's Army fighting the Contra rebels in the 
early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the changed climate in Nicaragua, Buschmann believes that the 
Chamorro government may honor Chile's extradition request this time. Hoping to 
preempt such action, Buschmann returned to Chile this month to face the charges 
against him. He was immediately arrested in Santiago. Los Angeles human rights 
attorney Peter Schey is helping with the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The web of safety that Sandinista protection gave the revolutionaries and 
radicals first began to unravel with a mysterious explosion at a clandestine 
arms dump in Managua last May. 
</P>
<P>
 The weapons were being stockpiled by Salvadoran rebels, in violation of 1992 
peace accords that ended the Salvadoran civil war, and kept underneath an auto 
repair shop owned by a Basque who allegedly belonged to the Basque separatist 
group ETA. 
</P>
<P>
 The Basque had obtained Nicaraguan citizenship in 1990 using the name Miguel 
Antonio Larios. He disappeared after the explosion, although news reports last 
month quoted Interpol as having spotted him in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 The scandal around the explosion widened dramatically in the months that 
followed. Not only had it exposed the illegal hoarding of weapons, but 
officials discovered along with the guns and antiaircraft missiles documents 
proving the existence of a vast kidnaping and forgery ring involving leftists 
from Europe, the Mideast and all of Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, the Sandinista legacy had come back to haunt the Chamorro 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 International condemnation was mighty, and the U.S. Congress suspended 
millions of dollars in aid, accusing Chamorro of failing to rein in Sandinista 
intelligence operations and of harboring criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 To counter the attacks, Chamorro swiftly rounded up and deported three alleged 
ETA terrorists who had lived in Nicaragua for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The men were dispatched to Spain, where they originally were to face a battery 
of murder charges. Recent reports from Spain, however, indicated that two have 
been released for lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chamorro government, which itself employs a number of former Contras, then 
ordered all 990 people who obtained citizenship in the waning days of the 
Sandinista regime to report to the Interior Ministry with documents to prove 
their legal status and background. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer than 100 naturalized citizens bothered to appear, but the passions of 
Nicaragua's still-polarized society had been ignited. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandinista militants rallied in protest. They accused the government of 
capitulating to foreign pressure. They burned Interior Minister Alfredo 
Mendieta in effigy and marched outside the Spanish Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
 Arana Cantero and others formed the Dignity and National Sovereignty Movement, 
a Sandinista support group for the foreigners, arguing that the human and civil 
rights of naturalized citizens were being violated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a campaign of political persecution, with a touch of xenophobia," said 
Evelyn Palma, an attorney with a Sandinista human rights organization. "These 
are people associated with the Sandinista Front, identified with the 
revolution, and for that reason the government labels them 'terrorists.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some, like Guatemalan guerrillas, cannot go home because their native 
countries are still at war. Others have established roots in Nicaragua, 
marrying Nicaraguans and raising families. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the furor, the heat was turned up on Guido, the Magica Roma restaurateur 
whose real name is Alessio Casimirri. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian newspapers delving anew into the Moro case discovered and reported his 
whereabouts late last year, and the shadowy chef has been lying low ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Casimirri, through an intermediary, refused to be interviewed for this story 
-- unless he was paid. 
</P>
<P>
 But he told the Sandinista newspaper Barricada that he had no intention of 
leaving Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people would like me to go, but I am Nicaraguan and I have every 
right to be in this country," he said from his hide-out, speaking what 
Barricada called an Italian-accented Spanish sprinkled with Nicaraguan slang. 
</P>
<P>
 Casimirri opened the Magica Roma restaurant last year. Under his gregarious 
management, the restaurant quickly became all the rage, frequented by Managua's 
elite and members of the international community. 
</P>
<P>
 An Italian diplomat was so fond of the place his family used it for a wedding 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who knew Casimirri's background didn't care; others never suspected. In 
the Barricada interview, Casimirri claimed that the Italian government knew for 
some time that he lived in Managua and only began to pursue him recently for 
domestic political reasons aimed at discrediting Italy's former Communists. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian courts have sentenced Casimirri in absentia to several life terms. His 
partner at the restaurant, Manlio Grillo, is another reputed Red Brigade member 
wanted in a bombing that killed two children. Grillo can still be found at the 
restaurant most nights. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a former Sandinista intelligence officer who handled many of the 
foreign cases, Casimirri first arrived in Nicaragua, from Libya, in 1983. He 
obtained Nicaraguan citizenship in 1988 using the name Guido di Giambattista. 
Rene Vivas, deputy interior minister in the Sandinista government and former 
police chief in the Chamorro government, signed the order. 
</P>
<P>
 Casimirri married a Nicaraguan, Raquel Garcia, and they have two children. 
Mendieta canceled his citizenship, but an appellate court recently stayed the 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandinista militants defend the protection they gave radicals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The terrorist thing is very relative," said Sandinista political science 
professor Silvio Prado. "Yitzhak Rabin directed a terrorist commando unit 
before Israel became a state, and now he is a chief of state. Don't forget that 
in the '70s, the armed struggle was an option for many people. Who is to 
determine which terrorism is good and which terrorism is bad?" 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials do not share that ambivalence, pointing out that the actions of 
terrorist groups such as the Red Brigades and ETA have claimed many innocent 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sandinista Front, feeling itself under attack, felt they had the right to 
defend themselves with many sorts of actions which perhaps in the past could be 
justified according to their opinion," said Chamorro's chief adviser, Antonio 
Lacayo. "The problem is, today that is over." 
</P>
<P>
 One flaw in the government's efforts, say critics, is that all foreigners who 
sought out Nicaragua's revolution end up getting painted with the same 
"terrorist" brush. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the radical leftists, there were pacifists, social workers and 
doctors for whom Sandinista Nicaragua seemed a romantic challenge, a chance to 
participate in a society trying to remake itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Stewart, a Canadian specialist in library science, moved to Nicaragua 
in 1983, attracted by the excitement of potential social change. Instead, she 
witnessed a country go to war, then enter a peace that it seems unable to 
reconcile with the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, 43, spent the last 11 years setting up databases for think tanks and 
other organizations and teaching computer skills. She became a citizen in 1990 
and is among those whose status the government is questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 While she does not feel threatened by the government's campaign, Stewart 
opposes it because it ignores due process and the norms of international law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a terrorist, I'm not a criminal," she said. "I've done everything to 
contribute to my field in Nicaragua. I work seven days a week. If someone wants 
to attack me as someone who doesn't deserve (citizenship), well, I'm very 
defensible. Many others are not." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Stewart has decided to sell her house and leave for Los Angeles, where 
she plans to work at a university library. It is not just the harassment and 
constant uncertainty that have taken their toll. Like many who were once true 
believers, Stewart has become disenchanted with the Sandinista Front and 
generally discouraged about Nicaragua's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no hope for Nicaragua," she said. "That's why I'm leaving."

ALPINE COUNTY RACE SHOWS EVERY VOTE COUNTS; ELECTIONS: BALLOTS WERE CAST BY

 Everyone knows of one, an offender most foul, but no one here will rat out a 
neighbor, tattle on a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 C. Ann Wade, supervisor for Alpine County's District 3, knows five of them. 
Sheriff Henry (Skip) Veatch knows four, but he is too much of a gentleman to 
divulge an identity -- even though they cost him big. 
</P>
<P>
 Who are these culprits? Only their county clerk knows for sure. 
</P>
<P>
 In remote Alpine County, where the government owns 96% of the land and the 
only bank closed about 15 years ago, 76.5% of those registered voted -- more 
than double the turnout statewide and higher than any election in recent county 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 175 men and women did not bother to vote, and they are kicking themselves 
these days, for the sheriff's race, a heated battle, ended in a mathematical 
near-impossibility, an honest-to-goodness tie: Skip Veatch 276, Villa (Lew) 
Roper 276. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lady at the library, the day after the election, had her ballot in her 
purse," Wade said, recounting a tale that is repeated all over town. "She never 
sent it in. She said, 'Now I know what they mean by one vote counts.' She voted 
for Lew Roper." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't look for a teacher to thank for such stunning civic involvement, even 
here in the county seat of Markleeville. The northeast California county is so 
small that there is no high school; these California kids learn government in 
Nevada, grow up knowing more of Carson City than they do of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when the polls closed statewide two weeks ago today, more than 
three-quarters of Alpine County's 745 registered voters -- 1,113 people live 
there -- had cast ballots. One reason the turnout was so spectacular was that 
it was not really a turnout at all. With such a low population that it is hard 
to muster up a polling place, Alpine County voters cast their ballots by mail, 
the only county in the state to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alpine truly is a high-participating county; its results are not just a fluke 
of registration rolls," says Mark DiCamillo, director of the Field Poll. "That 
is the most persuasive reason I've heard (for the high turnout), not the 
demographics but the voting method." 
</P>
<P>
 But local pundits have a better explanation of why Alpine County put the rest 
of California to shame: There were two emotional races made even more heated in 
part by the death of a 4-year-old Native American child in a complex abuse case 
that crossed the California-Nevada border. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a case that doubled turnout in the Native American community, Wade's 
District 3, where the drama began. A case that even Veatch grudgingly admits 
colored the races for sheriff and district attorney. "A couple of things came 
up that hurt us," Veatch says. "The Ortiz case was one." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Terry Ortiz and her children were visiting relatives in the Alpine 
County town of Woodfords, home to the Southern Band Washoe Tribe of 
California-Nevada. During the visit, family members reported to social service 
workers that Letisia Ortiz, then 2, had been abused, bitten on her nose and 
burned on her feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The child and three siblings were taken from their mother and placed by the 
court with other family members. On Jan. 24, an Alpine County Superior Court 
judge gave Letisia and her sister, Rosa, back to their mother, who was living 
on a ranch in nearby Genoa, Nev. Two months later, Letisia was dead, beaten 
with a glass baby bottle. Her mother is in jail in Nevada, awaiting trial for 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department has never had a good relationship with the 310 Native 
Americans who live in Alpine County. "The community feels the Sheriff's 
Department doesn't respond. They live less than five minutes away, but it takes 
them up to two hours to come here," Wade says. "We need someone to take control 
of the officers and make them do their job." 
</P>
<P>
 Veatch acknowledges the strained relations, the Washoe Tribe's concerns that 
its members get short shrift. But recent studies, he says, show that 40% of the 
department's enforcement calls take place in Native American territory, while 
the community makes up only 30% of the county's population. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's disproportionate," he says. "We respond to the calls the same without 
regard to race or geographic area. . . . We respond with a great deal of 
concern." 
</P>
<P>
 A report commissioned by the Board of Supervisors is highly critical of how 
both the Sheriff's Department and the district attorney's office handled the 
Ortiz case. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is missing is a routine, regular procedure for automatic referral to the 
District Attorney's Intake Section of Alpine County of all suspected criminal 
activities involving child physical and sexual abuse," the report states. "A 
criminal investigation which may or may not have resulted in the filing of 
criminal charges was not conducted." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Veatch declines to speak in detail about the case or the report, he 
insists that an investigation was carried out. And he admits that Letisia 
Ortiz's death just two months before the election hurt both him and Dist. Atty. 
Henry Murdock, who lost his bid to remain in office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ortiz thing hurt both of us as incumbents," he says. "We were in office 
when it happened. A scapegoat was sought." 
</P>
<P>
 For all the factors that caused Alpine County residents to vote in record 
numbers -- the heated races, the mail-in ballots -- voting here is not 
automatic. The electorate of Alpine County overcomes one very high hurdle: Some 
barely acknowledge that they live in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Physically we belong to Nevada," said David Kirby, owner of Woodford's 
Station, part general store, part local hangout. Alpine County shops, works and 
goes to school across the state line and at one time actually was part of 
Nevada. Sometimes it still feels that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1987 and 1992, employees of this eastern California county negotiated 
for a paid day off on Oct. 31 so they could celebrate Nevada Day, the legal 
holiday commemorating Nevada's admission to the Union. And California news -- 
political or otherwise -- is terribly hard to come by, a real hurdle for anyone 
attempting to actually know what they're voting about. The television stations 
all beam from Nevada, and most newspapers travel west across the state line. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I saw Ronald Reagan on television was when he ran for 
President," says Nancy Thornburg, executive director of the Alpine County 
Museum. "One thing that's so darn frustrating is that you can't get any 
California television stations here. You just don't get the information you 
need." 
</P>
<P>
 At least Thornburg talks about the election. Chris Branscombe doesn't even 
like to do that, and was crestfallen, as a matter of fact, when the sheriff's 
race tied. To others, the tie is a statistical freak show; to the Branscombes 
it is a guarantee of five months of discord until the November runoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Branscombe works for Sheriff Veatch. Her husband is employed by Woodford's 
Auto Service, whose owner has a longstanding and complicated complaint against 
the Sheriff's Department, part small-town intrigue and part retribution. At 
Woodford's, they vote for Lew Roper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm between a rock and a hard place in this election," she said. "I handed my 
husband his ballot and I filled out mine, and we didn't talk about who we'd 
voted for." 
</P>
<P>
 Branscombe is not the only one who feels bad this Election Day. Yes, it may 
have been difficult, but at least she voted. Which is more than can be said for 
some people here in Markleeville. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman who sauntered into Alpine County Library on June 8 only to find her 
ballot when looking for her library card would not consent to be interviewed 
for this story. In fact, her friends are so kind that they would not divulge 
her name and instead called her for a statement on her voting lapse. 
</P>
<P>
 How does it feel to be one of the few, the not-so-proud, the disenfranchised 
here in the cradle of California democracy? 
</P>
<P>
 "Just lousy," she said, through an intermediary.

COOL, CALM AND COLLECTING A FORTUNE; LUCK: LOMPOC MAN, 72, QUIETLY TURNS IN HIS 
$51.6-MILLION LOTTO WINNER, A RECORD FOR A SINGLE TICKET-HOLDER. HE PLANS TO DO 
SOME TRAVELING WITH HIS WIFE -- AND KEEP WORKING.

 Augustine Chiarenza saw much of the world as an airman during World War II and 
the Korean War. Now, the 72-year-old winner of Super Lotto's $51.6-million 
jackpot plans to see it at a more leisurely pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiarenza calmly cashed in the winning ticket at the Ventura lottery office 
Monday, saying the swirl of excitement surrounding his windfall "hasn't really 
struck me yet." 
</P>
<P>
 "I still can't visualize what this means," he said. "I'm in a state of shock." 
</P>
<P>
 Chiarenza bought the ticket Friday at a convenience store in his hometown of 
Lompoc, west of Santa Barbara. When he saw the numbers match up in the 
newspaper, he said, he refused to believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even tell my wife at first," he said. "I went down to the store and 
had them check, and when it checked out, I called her and said: 'We won the 
grand prize. All six numbers.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not until Monday, when Marguerite Chiarenza arrived with her 
husband to claim the prize, that she realized how much they had won. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait," she said, cupping her hands over her mouth as her husband repeated the 
amount to a reporter. "I thought it was $5 million. It's $50 million? Oh my 
goodness!" 
</P>
<P>
 When Chiarenza arrived at the lottery office Monday to claim his prize, he was 
as calm as if he had won only $5. 
</P>
<P>
 "My life's not going to change," said Chiarenza, a 34-year employee at Martin 
Marietta's Vandenberg Air Force Base facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't plan to quit my job or do anything different other than pay off my 
car and my house," he said. "I'll even go buy my lottery ticket every week, 
just like I have for the past five years." 
</P>
<P>
 Marguerite Chiarenza said she planned to fly to Virginia to see her mother, 
and both expressed a desire to travel. 
</P>
<P>
 "He saw the whole world when he was in the Air Force," Marguerite Chiarenza 
said. "Now we can see it together." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside of travel, Chiarenza said he may give some of his money to the Elks 
Club in Lompoc, where he has long been a member. But he plans to invest most of 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
 The payout, which Chiarenza won on a Quick Pick ticket, is the largest 
California lottery prize awarded to a single ticket-holder. The winning numbers 
were 6, 11, 26, 27, 38 and 50. The previous record was a $45.3-million award 
given in 1990 to Thomas Tehee of Upland. 
</P>
<P>
 Lottery officials said Monday that $90 million in tickets were sold before 
Saturday's drawing, and $30.6 million of that money will go to finance various 
education programs in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiarenza was born in Pennsylvania and has been married to Marguerite for 17 
years. Each has a grown son from a previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Chiarenza, who works as a technician at a hospital in Palm Springs, said 
he was not surprised that his father planned to continue working, despite his 
newfound wealth. "That's just the type of man he is. He loves his work and 
that's what makes him happy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Peter's father said Monday that he still had to ask permission to 
miss a day of work so he could drive to Ventura to turn in the winning ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called my boss and asked him if I could take the day off, and when I told 
him why, he said: 'You've got to be kidding me,' " Chiarenza said. 
</P>
<P>
 He may need another day off when the first of 20 annual checks for $1,859,040 
-- after taxes -- is delivered to his Lompoc home in three weeks, Chiarenza 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take a little time to recover from this," he said. "I'm glad 
I've got a strong heart."

HILL REMOVED FROM SENATE COMMITTEES; LEGISLATURE: THE STATE SENATOR'S 
COLLEAGUES ARE PRESSURING HIM TO QUICKLY RESIGN HIS SEAT. HE WAS CONVICTED LAST 
WEEK OF POLITICAL CORRUPTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier), convicted last week of political corruption 
charges, was stripped of his committee assignments Monday by the Senate Rules 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The action was aimed at pressuring Hill to resign his Senate seat swiftly and 
avoid a potential election year embarrassment for incumbent lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 The bipartisan 5-0 Rules Committee vote occurred as reports swept through the 
Capitol that Hill might seek to delay his departure until Sept. 12, when he is 
scheduled for sentencing on political corruption convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill remained closeted and tight-lipped in his fifth-floor Capitol office but 
told a Times reporter that he had not decided when he would submit his 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill was found guilty Thursday by a federal court jury of extortion, 
conspiracy and money laundering while serving as a state assemblyman in 1988. 
He accepted a $2,500 check from an undercover FBI agent who was investigating 
suspected corruption in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside of legislators, most elected state officials must resign their posts 
when they are convicted of a crime. However, the state Constitution leaves it 
up to the Legislature whether to expel a member. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Rules Committee action fell short of initiating an expulsion 
proceeding against Hill, it clearly was intended as a message to Hill that he 
should resign before the issue erupts into a major election year embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), committee chairman, 
indicated that further action may be forthcoming, but he declined to elaborate 
pending consultation with the Legislature's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he expects that Hill, who served on the Senate Budget, Governmental 
Organization and Insurance committees, will resign and that it is merely a 
matter of timing when he will do so. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Hill, a pragmatic conservative, reported to work as usual. But he 
remained in his office with aides, did not attend the Senate floor session and 
refused requests by reporters for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 A reporter who spoke briefly with the 40-year-old lawmaker during a chance 
encounter asked him if he intends to remain on the Senate payroll until 
sentencing. "I haven't made any decisions," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Lockyer told reporters that Hill contacted him after the 
jury verdicts last week and said he intends to remain on the Senate payroll but 
would not vote or participate in committee hearings or floor sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 By relieving Hill of his committee assignments, the Rules Committee guaranteed 
that he would not cast a vote in committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the Senate dealt with a similar situation occurred four years 
ago when Sen. Joseph Montoya (D-Whittier), also convicted of political 
corruption, did not step down as quickly as other senators wished. To hurry 
things along, the Rules Committee stripped him of his committee chairmanships. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer said he believed that Hill wants a "brief chance to get his personal 
affairs in order and to attend to family obligations" before resigning. 
</P>
<P>
 On pressing Hill to leave, Lockyer said, senators find themselves in the 
difficult position of choosing between their "personal feelings for a 
well-liked colleague (and) our duties to the institution." 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators believe that Hill, who is married and the father of three 
children, faces mounting legal costs and may want to keep his seat as long as 
possible to provide income to his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were in his shoes, I'd want to stay as long as I could," said Sen. 
Nicholas C. Petris (D-Oakland), a member of the Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ruth Holton, executive director of California Common Cause, said Hill 
should resign immediately. "He's been convicted of a felony. It's the only 
appropriate thing to do for the health of the institution," she said.

HIGH COURT TURNS BACK TRIBES' BID; GAMBLING: CASINO OPERATORS SOUGHT TO 
OVERTURN RULINGS THAT A POPULAR VIDEO GAMING MACHINE CAN BE USED ONLY WITH 
STATE PERMISSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday turned back a bid by Indian tribes to use a 
popular type of video gambling machine in their casinos without permission from 
their home states. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices refused to consider an appeal filed by eight tribes -- three of 
them from California -- to lower court rulings that they must have gambling 
compacts with their states to legally use so-called video pull-tab machines. 
</P>
<P>
 The action was quickly applauded by California officials who have sought for 
several years to limit the scope of tribal gambling, saying that much of it -- 
particularly gambling machines -- is illegal here. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen California tribes have installed a variety of such machines 
anyway, some offering as many as 1,000 in their expanding gambling halls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big victory," said Deputy Atty. Gen. Cathy Christian, who has 
represented the state in negotiations with the tribes. "It clarifies any 
ambiguity about those machines." 
</P>
<P>
 The tribes, however, still have a suit pending before the U.S. 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals that seeks to force the state to accept wide-ranging casino 
gambling, including the profitable video devices. The tribes argue that 
technology employed in the California Lottery's own Keno game has, in effect, 
"opened the door" for them to offer electronic gambling. A federal judge in 
Sacramento previously ruled that the state was not negotiating the issue in 
good faith. 
</P>
<P>
 The case that reached the U.S. Supreme Court did not involve all electronic 
gambling, but one class of machines designed largely for Indian gambling halls. 
Tribal attorneys argued that these did not need state approval because they are 
little more than dispensers of pull-tab tickets, which are legal -- and 
commonly sold -- in bingo halls. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the plaintiffs were three California tribes active in gambling -- the 
Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, the Rumsey Rancheria and the San Manuel Band 
of Mission Indians -- along with others from North Carolina, Alabama, New 
Mexico, Washington and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 Their suit was prompted by a 1992 ruling from the National Indian Gaming 
Commission that while the tribes could offer bingo or poker parlors without 
state approval, the pull-tab machines required compacts -- much like off-track 
betting, blackjack and other casino gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal judge upheld the commission's decision, as did the U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The Supreme Court offered no 
comment in leaving those rulings intact. 
</P>
<P>
 The tribes complained that they could lose hundreds of millions of dollars if 
forced to stop using the machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Monday's decision could empower federal prosecutors to seize scores 
of pull-tab machines being used without state sanction, authorities in recent 
years have avoided such confrontational tactics when it comes to tribal 
gambling, preferring to let the courts first settle the considerable litigation 
swirling over the multibillion-dollar industry.

CANADA ENDS MORATORIUM WITH $1 MILLION IN AID TO CUBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG TURNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ending a 16-year moratorium on aid to Cuba, Canadian officials said Monday the 
Caribbean nation would receive about $1 million in government-supported 
development funds and direct humanitarian assistance this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cold War is long over. The people of Cuba are suffering from food 
shortages brought on by economic crisis and Canadians want to help them," 
Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet told reporters in Ottawa, while Christine 
Stewart, Canada's secretary of state for Latin America and Africa, announced 
details of the program at an economic conference in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said private groups receiving Canadian government grants would be 
permitted to fund development programs in Cuba through agencies outside the 
Cuban government. She said this would bring about $730,000 in Canadian 
development assistance to Cuba. Stewart also said Canada would donate about 
$365,000 to the World Food Program for humanitarian aid to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada suspended direct aid to Fidel Castro's government in 1978 because of 
Cuban military involvement in the Angolan civil war. Canada has made only 
occasional exceptions for disaster relief. But Canada, like Mexico, has 
maintained diplomatic relations and trade with Cuba throughout the U.S.-led 
embargo of Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian trade with Cuba totaled nearly $225 million last year, mainly 
importing sugar and nickel and exporting agricultural products. Canada also is 
the single largest source of visitors every year to Cuba, heavily promoted as a 
winter destination for Canadian tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. State Department reacted mildly to the announcement. "We have a 
slight difference of opinion (with Canada) on tactics, but we don't have any 
difference on the ultimate goal," a U.S. official said. Both Canada and the 
United States, the official said, favor peaceful democratic reform in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 In her speech Monday, Stewart described Canadian-Cuban relations as "active 
and positive" but called on the Castro government to improve civil and 
political rights. She said Canada is prepared to expand government exchanges 
with Cuba and will continue to promote business investment in the island 
nation. Stewart added that Canada "intends to examine, with other countries, 
what would be required for Cuba to re-establish its full membership" in the 
Organization of American States. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Lanfranco, an associate professor of economics at the Center for Latin 
American and Caribbean Studies at York University in Toronto, said several 
factors played a role in Canada's change in policy toward Cuba: the 
deteriorating economic situation in Cuba; the change in Canadian governments 
from the Progressive Conservative Party to the Liberals, and a growing 
recognition by Canada of the need to strengthen its trade and influence in the 
Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadian shift comes as Mexico is encouraging more investment in Cuba. In 
a visit to Cuba earlier this month, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
announced a $1.5-billion investment by the Monterrey-based Domos Group in the 
aging Cuban telephone system. The Mexican company agreed to pay $740 million 
for an unspecified interest in the government-owned phone company and to invest 
an equal amount over the next seven years to improve Cuban phone service.

U.N. RATES EFFORTS TO BETTER LIVES OF WOMEN, CHILDREN; CONDITIONS: U.S. TRAILS 
MANY NATIONS IN UNICEF RANKINGS FOR EDUCATION AND FAMILY PLANNING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The United Nations Children's Fund rated the nations of the world today on 
improving conditions for children and women and gave the United States mediocre 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
 In this nation, for example, 94% of girls finish fifth grade, a rate that 
ranked the United States only 21st among industrial nations. Six developing 
countries had higher percentages: Jamaica (99%), Hong Kong (99%), Singapore 
(98%), Turkey (97%), Uruguay (96%) and Sri Lanka (95%). In six industrial 
countries -- Austria, Finland, Israel, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland -- 100% of 
girls finished fifth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 In another category, the percentage of married women of child-bearing age who 
use some form of family planning, the United States ranked 10th among 
industrial nations -- tying with Slovakia -- with 74%. France led industrial 
nations with 80%. China led the world with 83%. 
</P>
<P>
 In its rankings, which it called a score sheet, UNICEF was mostly concerned 
with whether the developing world was reaching targets set by leaders at the 
World Summit for Children in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement accompanying the report, James P. Grant, UNICEF executive 
director, said, "As we near the middle of the decade, I can say that practical 
progress is being made toward a majority of the goals by a majority of the 
developing nations, and the lives of hundreds of millions of children are being 
improved as a result of these largely un-publicized efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 One goal was to reduce child malnutrition 20% by 1995 and 50% by 2000. While 
the report said most countries would meet the targets, 31 would not, either 
because of war, lack of resources or lack of a strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those unlikely to meet the goals because of lack of a strategy were 
Mexico and Nigeria. El Salvador, Pakistan and India were among those that had a 
nutrition strategy in place but too few resources to make meaningful strides. 
The countries that would fail because of war or some kind of internal strife 
included Angola, Burundi, Haiti, Lesotho, Liberia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Somalia, 
Sudan and Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the reports were surprising. The summit had agreed to prevent goiter 
by iodizing all salt supplies by 1995. But UNICEF said 29 countries had no 
plans to do this even though goiter had become or was about to become a public 
health problem. Most were developing countries but the list included Germany, 
Italy, Spain, Greece, Albania and Portugal. The United States had no problem of 
iodine deficiency disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 UNICEF also rated all countries on what it called "national performance gaps." 
This measured whether a country was using its wealth to tackle problems of its 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, UNICEF calculated what a country should have achieved in child survival, 
nutrition and education based on its per capita gross national product. The 
difference between what it should have achieved and actually did, UNICEF termed 
its national performance gap, which could be minus or positive. 
</P>
<P>
 UNICEF said the United States, based on its wealth, should have a mortality 
rate of 10 per 1,000 for children younger than 5. Because the nation's 
mortality rate equals that estimate, there is no gap in child survival. On the 
other hand, based on its wealth, 97% of U.S. girls should finish fifth grade. 
Because only 94% finish, the United States has a performance gap of minus 3 in 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 In comparison with the U.S. scores, almost all other industrial countries have 
plus ratings in child survival; only Belgium has a larger negative gap in 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 Disparities between nations are enormous. In Africa, for example, Kenya has 
national performance gaps of plus 67 in child survival, plus 21 in education 
and plus 15 in nutrition, which is measured by the percentage of children 
younger than 5 who are underweight. Niger, on the other hand, has national 
performance gaps of minus 173 in child survival, minus 21 in education and 
minus 6 in nutrition.

EDUCATION; NEW YORK SCHOOL HELPS A WORLD OF STUDENTS TRANSLATE SUCCESS; 
INTERNATIONAL HIGH ACCEPTS IMMIGRANT TEEN-AGERS WITH POOR ENGLISH SKILLS. THE 
HALLS RING WITH MORE THAN 40 LANGUAGES. 
</P>

 Sweat shirts and baseball caps. Students wearing T-shirts, mouths filled with 
braces. Horseplay in the halls between classes. At first glance, it could be 
almost any public high school. 
</P>
<P>
 But a closer look reveals that this particular mix of students is a 
multiculturalist's dream: a cornucopia of European, Asian and African faces, 
all filling the halls with a chorus of Caribbean, Eastern European and Chinese 
voices. 
</P>
<P>
 It's New York's International High, a four-year New York City public school. 
Criteria for admission: birth outside of the United States and a score of 20% 
or lower on an English proficiency exam. As a result, the school's 450 students 
represent 60 countries with more than 40 separate languages. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city that over the last several decades has experienced a vast influx of 
immigrants, statistics show the school is a necessity. Almost 15% of New York's 
1 million students have limited proficiency in English -- a trend that is 
accelerating, educators say. Half of all entering kindergarten pupils now come 
from homes where English is not the primary language. Into the Mainstream 
</P>
<P>
 By clustering immigrants in selected schools, teachers hope to accelerate 
their transition into American life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact we are all immigrants makes it easier. We are all more comfortable," 
says Molly Yu, 15, a native of China now living in Woodside, Queens. 
</P>
<P>
 The school, located on the campus of La Guardia Community College, was 
established in 1985 after educators took note of the increasing number of 
immigrant students attending the two-year college. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school and college are linked by more than location. International's 
students are encouraged to take college-level classes. They can use the college 
gym. And, most important, graduates of International High School are guaranteed 
admission to La Guardia. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt some of these students would fall through the cracks at a 
regular comprehensive high school," says Charles Glassman, a teacher and 
administrator at the school. "They aren't looked at as a benefit or resource." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, more than 90% of International High School's students continue on to 
college, a rate that rivals many better-heeled suburban school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 International's students bring to the classroom a wide variety of life 
experience. While some had consistent education before coming to the United 
States, others attended school in a piecemeal fashion. A few were not even 
literate in their native language. Students of all linguistic and educational 
backgrounds are mixed together in classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Immigrant students are a vulnerable population in our society," says 
Jacqueline Ancess, a senior research associate at Columbia University's 
Teacher's College. "One of the most important things International High School 
does is provide immigrant students with access to a rigorous academic 
education. They are not handicapped because they are not American citizens or 
native English speakers." 
</P>
<P>
 But not all educators are supporters of four-year high schools for immigrant 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Willis Hawley, dean of the University of Maryland's College of Education and a 
scholar of desegregation, questions the appropriateness of separating immigrant 
students from others. 
</P>
<P>
 "A concern you could have is if separation of children from the mainstream 
population might retard their ability to learn the culture," Hawley says. "Ask 
yourself the question: If you're growing up in France, would it be the best 
thing to go to school with other American kids? It would be more comfortable, 
but would it be in your best interests in the long run?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Principal Eric Nadelstern says his students need a special setting like 
the one International High provides. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is that the trauma all adolescents experience (is compounded). 
They've left their families, they face a culture they can't quite comprehend 
and a language they don't know at a time when undergoing adolescent travails," 
Nadelstern says. "Considering the dislocation they've faced, they need to feel 
connected." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleurina Kuka, now 16, was left with her older brother and grandmother when 
her parents left Yugoslavia and came to the United States eight years ago. 
Lives of Challenge 
</P>
<P>
 Now in the United States two years, Kuka still misses her grandmother 
fiercely. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's like my mother. I feel like my (real) parents are just taking care of 
me. I can't love them like other people love their parents. It's not that 
easy." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's Diantha Hall, 16, one of the few students in the school 
actually born in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall's Costa Rican-born mother and Panamanian-born father split up when she 
was 5. Her mother remained in New York, but sent Diantha to live with an aunt 
in Costa Rica for several years and she lost most of her English language 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really confused. I want to go back home, but I want to stay here," Hall 
says. "If I could do anything, I would turn back the clock and just do things 
one way. No changes. When I went over to Costa Rica with no Spanish, I didn't 
know anybody, not my grandmother, not my aunt. When I come back here, I didn't 
know nobody. I felt lonely even though I'm a person who finds friends 
everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Spanish is the most common language of the school's students, followed by 
Chinese and Polish. Others include Russian and Korean. 
</P>
<P>
 Students do not take bilingual classes. English is taught through the 
immersion method in the school's small classes, but students are encouraged to 
continue studying and speaking their native tongue. Often, older students act 
as impromptu translators for more recent arrivals. Students share their fears 
and problems with one another. They talk about the violence that's pervasive in 
many of their neighborhoods, missing relatives and friends left behind in their 
native countries -- and, for some, their hatred of New York's winter climate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came in the winter and it was terrible," says Kruskaya Cabral, 15, of her 
arrival in Brooklyn from the Dominican Republic two years ago. "Yes, I wanted 
to leave right away. It was different, I didn't feel anyone cared. I miss a lot 
of things -- friends, my country and I didn't know English." A Place to Fit In 
</P>
<P>
 Students discover International in a variety of ways. Many are recommended by 
guidance counselors at other city schools. Others hear about it from neighbors 
and friends already attending the school. Still others come after a year at the 
city's Liberty High School, a one-year transitional program for recent 
immigrant students. 
</P>
<P>
 And some graduates find it hard to leave the school. Mohammad Nader, 24, a 
1988 graduate, is studying political science at Queens College. He also runs 
International's computer lab. 
</P>
<P>
 Nader arrived at International in 1985 as part of its first class. He and his 
older brother were smuggled out of Afghanistan in the back of a truck. Arriving 
in Queens to stay with an older brother, Nader spoke no English and found 
himself in the ninth grade at a junior high school while working at an Arkansas 
Fried Chicken fast-food restaurant on weekends. A guidance counselor steered 
him to International. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard then, and it's still hard. At (15), I was on my own, no mom, no 
dad, going to school, paying bills, no one to check my homework," Nader 
recalls. "I personally don't think I would have gone further than high school 
if I'd gone to another school. I'd probably be one of the dropouts." 
International High's success has spawned similar institutions. A second 
International High School is now in its first year of operation in Manhattan's 
Chinatown, and still another is slated to open its doors in Brooklyn in time 
for the 1994-95 academic year.

HIV-INFECTED ARTIST'S SHOW DRAWS ANGER OF 2 SENATORS; ARTS: THE PERFORMANCE 
INCLUDES PASSING A BLOODIED TOWEL ABOVE THE AUDIENCE. SENS. BYRD AND NICKLES 
SEND PROTEST LETTER TO THE NEA CHAIRWOMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two senators have protested to the National Endowment for the Arts the funding 
of a performance in which an HIV-positive artist takes his own blood on stage. 
The senators warned that the NEA risks losing its budget by supporting such 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Sens. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) and Don Nickles (R-Okla.) said in a letter to 
NEA Chairwoman Jane Alexander that the agency's funding for fiscal year 1995 
would be in "serious jeopardy" if efforts are not taken to prevent "such 
grossly improper activities." 
</P>
<P>
 The senators, quoting from a Washington Post story, said that artist Ron 
Athey, performing at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis on March 5, tapped 
his scalp with needles to draw blood and stuck his arm with acupuncture 
needles. 
</P>
<P>
 Athey also cut a design into the back of another man, blotted the blood with a 
paper towel and hoisted the bloodied print on a clothesline above the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people in the audience knocked over chairs as they fled from 
underneath the clothesline, according to the Post report. 
</P>
<P>
 The Walker Art Center has disputed the accuracy of the report, saying most of 
the people stayed and there was no panicked exit, and it stated that the 
performance posed no health risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really outrageous when one performance is used to overshadow the 
extraordinary programs that this agency has helped put into place," said Cherie 
Simon, NEA's director of public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that the NEA gave Walker, one of the nation's most prestigious art 
centers, a grant of $104,500 this year, and that support for the Athey 
performance probably amounted to $100 or $150. 
</P>
<P>
 But Byrd and Nickles said in the letter that it was "unconscionable that the 
NEA would fund and condone such a performance, especially when the health of 
the audience members is put at risk." 
</P>
<P>
 "The public should be able to expect to attend a publicly funded performance 
without being exposed to HIV-infected blood." 
</P>
<P>
 The Walker Art Center said the blood on the paper towel was not from an 
HIV-infected man. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrd is the chairman and Nickles the ranking Republican of the Senate Interior 
appropriations subcommittee, which is responsible for overseeing the NEA 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 They reminded Alexander in the letter that the NEA has been embroiled in 
controversy before and that its funding depends on ensuring that the projects 
it supports not be a misuse of taxpayer money. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress last fall approved a 1994 budget of $170 million for the NEA after 
turning back attempts by conservatives to eliminate or cut funding for the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of NEA say it has provided money for art that is obscene or offends 
traditional values. 
</P>
<P>
 The NEA, an independent federal agency, has provided 100,000 grants since it 
was founded in 1965 to support symphonies, museums, dance companies and folk 
art.

20 STATES SUE U.S. TO FORCE DISPOSAL OF NUCLEAR WASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California and 19 other states sued the federal government Monday to force it 
to begin disposing of high-level radioactive waste from nuclear power plants by 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., demands 
that the federal government live up to obligations under a 1982 law requiring 
that it safely dispose of nuclear waste. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20 states all get a portion of their electricity from nuclear plants. 
Since 1982, people using electricity from those plants have paid a fee to cover 
the cost of building a federal nuclear waste dump, although one isn't expected 
before 2010. The Energy Department says it might have a dump operating then at 
Nevada's Yucca Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 The states contend that the federal government has an obligation to provide a 
temporary storage dump until a permanent one opens. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 22,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel is stored at 111 power plants. 
More than a dozen utilities that have nuclear power plants filed a lawsuit 
similar to the states' suit, said a spokesman for state Atty. Gen. Frank Kelley 
in Michigan, one of the states that sued. 
</P>
<P>
 The other states filing the suit were Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, 
Delaware, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, 
Missouri, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont and 
Wisconsin.

U.N. CHIEF URGES OK FOR FRENCH FORCE IN RWANDA; AFRICA: THE 2,000 TROOPS WOULD 
PROTECT CIVILIANS FROM BEING MASSACRED. THE SECURITY COUNCIL IS EXPECTED TO 
GIVE AUTHORIZATION TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali urged the Security Council on 
Monday to accept a French offer to send 2,000 troops into Rwanda in a dramatic 
attempt to halt the massacres of civilians that have sickened the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomatic sources said they expect the council to pass a resolution perhaps 
by the end of today authorizing the intervention. Although swift French action 
might embarrass U.S. officials, whose lack of enthusiasm has hampered the 
organization of a U.N. peacekeeping force in the last few weeks, U.N. 
Ambassador Madeleine Albright endorsed the French proposal when it was 
presented to her by French Ambassador Jean-Bernard Merimee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are generally supportive of this humanitarian effort as a bridging 
operation (until U.N. troops arrive) because we are concerned about the 
killings," Albright told reporters. A U.S. official added that "the French 
ought to be congratulated, not questioned." 
</P>
<P>
 Support from the secretary general was not a surprise. He has condemned as a 
scandal the world community's seeming impotence to do anything about the 
slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Rwandans in a civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 The slaughter began when the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi, both members of 
the Hutu tribe, died in a mysterious plane crash April 6 at Kigali's airport. 
The Hutu-controlled army and marauding, young Hutu extremists then began to 
slaughter members of the minority Tutsi tribe and moderate Hutus who wanted to 
share power with the Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front, dominated by Tutsis, has been 
accused of committing atrocities against Hutus as the Hutu army retreated into 
southern Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Much like the U.S.-led troops in the Persian Gulf War, the French-led force, 
while it would have the Security Council's blessing, would not be a U.N. 
peacekeeping operation. Under the French resolution, this special intervention 
force -- which would try to protect civilians and prevent massacres -- would 
operate only until the United Nations was ready to take over the job. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only the Senegalese have offered to augment the French force with an 
unannounced number of troops. News reports from Paris said the French probably 
would deploy 1,000 troops now stationed in Africa first, then would set up a 
1,000-troop unit on standby, ready to move into Rwanda within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter, Boutros-Ghali said he probably would not have a 5,500-troop 
peacekeeping force -- as authorized by the Security Council -- on the ground in 
Rwanda in less than three months. "Meanwhile," he said, "the situation in 
Rwanda has continued to deteriorate and the killings of innocent civilians has 
not been stopped. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "In these circumstances," he went on, "the Security Council may wish to 
consider the offer of the government of France to undertake, subject to 
Security Council authorization, a French-commanded multinational operation . . 
. to assure the security and protection of displaced persons and civilians at 
risk in Rwanda." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rwandan Patriotic Front has objected to any French intervention 
because of fears the troops would do little more than defend the retreating 
Rwandan army. In the past, France was looked on as a staunch supporter of the 
Rwandan government. 
</P>
<P>
 Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who has close ties to the Patriotic Front, 
said the French must convince the rebels that they are coming to Rwanda only to 
protect civilians. "If they come in with soldiers to save the army from 
defeat," he told a lunch meeting of the Corporate Council on Africa in 
Washington, "this will be a big problem for the French." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. diplomats believe, however, that if the French-led intervention receives 
the approval of the Security Council under a resolution pledging that the 
troops will halt the slaughter of civilians, the rebels will withdraw 
objections and decide not to harass the French and Senegalese troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali outlined the status of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in his 
letter to the Security Council. Reporting that the United Nations has only 503 
peacekeepers in Rwanda trying to cope with the rescue of countless victims, 
Boutros-Ghali said he had received offers of infantry battalions from Ethiopia, 
Ghana, Senegal, Zambia and Zimbabwe and infantry companies from the Congo, 
Malawi, Mali and Nigeria. But all the offers, save that of Ethiopia, were 
conditional -- the troops would not go to Rwanda unless the United Nations 
could obtain equipment for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the French resolution, the French-led troops, unlike U.N. peacekeepers, 
would have the authority to use "all necessary means" to protect civilians and 
end massacres.

BOMB KILLS 25 WORSHIPERS, INJURES 70 IN IRAN MAUSOLEUM 
</P>

<P>
 A bomb blew up in a crowded mausoleum in Iran's holy city of Mashhad on 
Monday, killing 25 people and wounding 70 gathered for prayer, Iran's official 
news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested a number of people in connection with the blast, the official 
Islamic Republic News Agency said in reports monitored in Nicosia.It gave no 
further details. 
</P>
<P>
 The government blamed the opposition Moujahedeen Khalq for the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dissident group denied involvement in the attack on Mashhad, 450 miles 
east of Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
 The news agency initially reported 70 dead and 114 wounded. But it said later 
that those figures were based on accounts from witnesses and that an 
unidentified Interior Ministry official had announced the lower toll. 
</P>
<P>
 The bomb reportedly exploded in the prayer hall of the mausoleum of Imam Reza, 
a saint in the Shiite branch of Islam. Worshipers were observing the mourning 
day of Ashura, the anniversary of the 7th-Century martyrdom of the Shiites' 
most revered saint, Hussein, grandson of the Prophet Mohammed, Islam's founder. 
</P>
<P>
 State-run television said the blast was caused by an 11-pound bomb.

ISRAELI DIES IN LEBANON AMBUSH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Muslim guerrillas ambushed an Israeli patrol today, killing at least one 
soldier, after Israel's air force twice attacked Hezbollah strongholds in south 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambush occurred in a border enclave that Israeli troops have occupied in 
southern Lebanon since 1985.The zone is intended to guard against guerrilla 
raids into northern Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said three Israelis were 
killed and three wounded in the ambush. 
</P>
<P>
 But military sources in Jerusalem said one Israeli soldier was killed and four 
were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The discrepancy could not be immediately resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambush and the air strikes touched off artillery and rocket duels along 
the edge of the enclave, pitting Israeli troops and their Lebanese militia 
allies against Hezbollah fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebanese sources said a Lebanese woman was killed, and five others, including 
two guerrillas, were wounded in the air strikes and ensuing artillery battles. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said two Israeli fighter-bombers fired two rockets targeting a 
Hezbollah base at midafternoon. An hour later, two jets bombed a village in the 
western sector of the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of eastern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli soldiers were ambushed about an hour after the second air raid, 
the Lebanese sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Security sources said that before the air raids, guerrillas fired machine guns 
and rocket-propelled grenades at two outposts manned by Israeli soldiers and 
South Lebanon Army militiamen in the central part of the buffer zone.

FIGHT AGAINST ULSTER TERROR ON TRACK DESPITE SETBACK; NORTHERN IRELAND: THE 
DEATHS OF 25 OFFICERS IN A HELICOPTER CRASH HAD RAISED FEARS FOR BRITISH 
SECURITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Britain's campaign against terrorism in Northern Ireland suffered an enormous 
setback early this month when 25 senior officers in the security establishment 
were killed in a helicopter crash in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers, along with four crew members, died en route from Belfast to 
Inverness for a top-secret security conference and a major review of the 
efforts to end violence perpetrated by members of the separatist Irish 
Republican Army. 
</P>
<P>
 In an instant, the anti-terrorism forces lost senior officers of the Royal 
Ulster Constabulary, which is Northern Ireland's police force; of the 
government's police intelligence arm, called the Special Branch; of the 
internal security agency known as MI-5, and of the intelligence division of the 
British army. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Northern Ireland security experts suggested the officers were 
irreplaceable and that the government's war against the IRA and Unionist 
paramilitary forces would be severely hampered. In effect, it was suggested, 
the "high command" in the war against terrorism in Northern Ireland had been 
wiped out. 
</P>
<P>
 But nearly three weeks later, Northern Ireland officials say, the dead 
officers have been replaced and the campaign against the IRA and other illegal 
organizations in the province of Ulster has resumed unabated. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have established that the June 2 crash of the Boeing-built Chinook 
helicopter was not caused by sabotage -- though whether it was due to pilot 
error in bad weather or to mechanical failure has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we have experienced a deep sense of loss," said one official in 
Britain's Northern Ireland Office. "And it has left huge gaps. But our security 
structure is something like the army's. There are other officers ready to step 
up and fill those vacant posts." 
</P>
<P>
 Further, officials say that most of the information carried by those killed in 
the crash is contained in the computerized files of the Northern Ireland 
Office, the police and the army. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not as if these senior officers carried secrets to the grave with 
them," said an official in Belfast. "For years, the security policy here has 
been for the left hand to let the right hand know what it is doing." 
</P>
<P>
 But the unexplained decision to place 25 senior officers aboard a single 
helicopter for a long flight, over water, from Belfast to Inverness has been 
strongly criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 "That decision has damaged morale," one Belfast-based diplomat said. "You 
wonder how anyone could have made such a stupid decision. And these, after all, 
were the cream of the . . . intelligence establishment." 
</P>
<P>
 The security machine in Northern Ireland is enormous. The Royal Ulster 
Constabulary has about 12,000 members, the British army another 12,000; there 
are 6,000 members of the local army militia and 3,500 in the prison service. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Ireland experts point out that while the loss of senior officers was 
grievous, those officials would not have had day-to-day involvement with 
informers -- a practice that lies at the heart of the anti-terrorism operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "One or two of them might have been the contact for a top-level informer," 
said one Ulster specialist. "But by and large, such contacts are handled by 
lower-level officers." 
</P>
<P>
 The breadth of the Northern Ireland operation was explained last week when 
MI-5 head Stella Rimington revealed on television that her agency now devotes 
three-quarters of its efforts to counterterrorism activities, and nearly half 
to Irish terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 MI-5, also known as the Security Service, is a cross between the FBI and the 
counterintelligence arm of the CIA. Like the CIA, it has no powers of arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the past 18 months," Rimington said, "more than 20 Irish republican 
terrorists have been arrested in Great Britain and charged. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Northern Ireland, the security forces prevent four out of five terrorist 
attacks which are attempted," she added.

BORDER SEPARATING N. KOREA FROM CHINA APPEARS TOO POROUS TO SEAL; ASIA: A TRIP 
ALONG THE TUMEN RIVER SUGGESTS JUST HOW DIFFICULT IMPOSING ECONOMIC SANCTIONS 
ON NORTH WOULD BE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On the Chinese side of the border, a convoy of seven North Korean flatbed 
trucks, sagging under their load of several tons of Chinese rice, rumbled under 
an ornamental gate on their way across the Tumen River to North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Half a mile or so across the shallow, snow-fed river on a recent afternoon 
here, a North Korean steam engine whistled impatiently as it waited to receive 
the vital cargo and transport it to the hungry interior. North Korea is an 
economically strapped nation where food is strictly rationed and where the 
patriotic goal, still unrealized, is two meals a day for all citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. reporters granted a rare visit to the Chinese-North Korean border here in 
Jilin province recently watched a steady flow of such goods being transported 
between Tumen, one of seven border-crossing points in the province, and the 
North Korean town on the opposite bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials said the trade has increased in recent months as the threat of 
U.N. economic sanctions against North Korea has mounted because of its 
suspected nuclear weapons program. The prospect of such sanctions seemed to 
recede over the weekend after former President Jimmy Carter's visit. But if 
they ever materialize, North Korea would rely even more heavily on its main 
link to the outside -- the corridor of northeast China along the Tumen River 
where North Korea, China and Russia meet. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 40% of North Korea's $736 million in trade with China -- its main 
lifeline for grains, other food and fuel -- passes through this remote area 
that is home to most of China's ethnic Korean population. 
</P>
<P>
 For any U.N. sanctions to succeed, this border would have to be sealed. But 
those who know the area say that would be a difficult, if not impossible, task 
for several reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 * Security along the 312-mile border in Jilin province is minimal, and 
smuggling is rampant. Few expect the Chinese government to vigorously enforce 
sanctions even if they are approved by the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Since 1982, when the border reopened after a 12-year break in friendly 
relations between the two countries sparked by China's Cultural Revolution, 
trade with North Korea has become one of the most important factors in the 
local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun Jinhu, deputy director of foreign trade for the Yanbian Autonomous 
Prefecture here, said the biggest increase in cross-border trade has come in 
the past two years -- a jump from $80 million in 1991 to more than $300 million 
last year. About 22 North Korean companies operate small joint-venture 
businesses, mostly hotels and restaurants, on the Chinese side. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ethnic and language ties among Koreans on both sides of the border are 
likely to subvert any attempt to implement sanctions meant to punish North 
Korea for its nuclear stance. 
</P>
<P>
 Korean Chinese rallied in great numbers to fight alongside their cross-border 
neighbors and relatives during the Korean War against American-led U.N. forces. 
Monuments to local soldiers killed in the conflict line both banks of the Tumen 
River. The nearly 1 million Korean Chinese who live in the Tumen River valley 
would probably resist any foreign efforts to close the border. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than 40% of our population is ethnic Korean," Sun said. "They share the 
same habits, language and lifestyle with the people across the border in the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea)." 
</P>
<P>
 In Yanji, the major city of the Korean Chinese ethnic minority area, 
waitresses in joint-venture restaurants wear lapel buttons bearing a photograph 
of North Korean leader Kim Il Sung. Korean singers in slinky gowns at the Bai 
Shan Nightclub croon North Korean ballads. The many stalls at the West Market 
in downtown Yanji sell North Korean products, ranging from red fox pelts to the 
gray stone pots and griddles highly prized in the Korean community. 
</P>
<P>
 If the sanctions proposal ever does come to a vote before the U.N. Security 
Council, the Chinese government is expected to abstain. But even if the 
sanctions were approved, their success would depend upon Chinese enforcement 
along this border. And there is no evidence here of a Chinese willingness or 
even ability to take this step. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1970 to 1982, the Chinese government officially closed its border with 
North Korea, both because of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution and because North 
Korea had taken the Soviet side in the Sino-Soviet split. 
</P>
<P>
 But even then the closing had little effect on the Korean population. When the 
political persecution of the Cultural Revolution became too intense, Koreans 
simply crossed over to the "motherland" to wait out the storm. When the Tumen 
River froze, as it does each winter, families walked across, as they have for 
centuries, to visit relatives on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, with relations repaired, the Tumen River is not so much a border as it 
is an inconvenience. Despite the severity of the North Korean regime, the 
border is one of the least secured in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a (312-mile) border with North Korea," said Chao Zhizhong, vice 
general manager of the Yanbian Foreign Economic Trade Co., which does $27 
million in business annually with the North Koreans. "We have a long history of 
relationships and trade along the Tumen River. People come and go freely." 
</P>
<P>
 The government recently announced a crackdown on smuggling along the border. 
But there was little evidence of any new precautions during a recent visit. 
</P>
<P>
 In a two-hour drive along the river between Yanji, capital of the Yanbian 
Korean Autonomous Prefecture, and the Russian border, the only evidence of 
border security was at lightly manned border-crossing stations and a few 
scattered watchtowers. 
</P>
<P>
 The most lasting impression from the trip was the huge gap in prosperity 
between the Chinese and their North Korean neighbors. Compared with the Chinese 
side of the border, undergoing a development boom sparked by the drive to 
develop the lower stretch of the Tumen River as a port linking China to the Sea 
of Japan, Korean villages on the other bank of the river looked shabby and 
silent. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic was heavy along broad new stretches of highway on the Chinese side, 
including hundreds of expensive imported four-wheel-drive trucks. But except 
for a pair of aging steam engines and the decrepit convoy of trucks on the 
Tumen bridge, there was no sign of motorized transport on the North Korean 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 In their arguments against sanctions, Chinese officials here argue that what 
North Korea needs most is not isolation but more exposure to the emerging 
market economy of its huge neighbor and former comrade in arms. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea is particularly sensitive about its dependence on China for the 
most basic commodities. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Tumen border station, photographers have erected colorful backdrops 
featuring Chinese and North Korean flags so that visitors can be photographed 
with North Korea in the background. But when American reporters began 
photographing the rice-laden trucks, a North Korean official appealed vainly to 
Chinese officials to confiscate the film. Trade Gateway 
</P>
<P>
 China is the main route for goods into North Korea. More than $300 million 
worth of goods passes through the remote corridor of northeast China along the 
Tumen River near where North Korea, China and Russia meet.

HARRY, LOUISE ADS RETURN TO TWEAK, FIGHT HEALTH REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Harry and Louise, the insurance industry's hit squad on health reform, 
returned to the airwaves Monday, raising new alarms over the specter of medical 
care rationing. 
</P>
<P>
 The new, $2-million advertising blitz is aimed at pressuring lawmakers to 
jettison constraints on medical spending and allow the industry to keep 
charging older workers and smokers higher premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the Health Insurance Assn. of America's 30-second spots, the anxious 
yuppie husband asks his wife: "They're talking price controls?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Rationing, the way I read it," Louise says. "You know, long waits for health 
care and some services not even available." 
</P>
<P>
 "Government-controlled health care -- Congress can do better than that," her 
husband says. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House, which accused the industry of spreading falsehoods in the 
earlier Harry and Louise ads, quickly pounced on the new versions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are back with a vengeance and with the same old scare tactics," said 
White House Budget Director Leon E. Panetta. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are insurance companies doing today if they are not in fact engaged in 
rationing" when they reject people with pre-existing conditions, Panetta said. 
</P>
<P>
 He charged that the Health Insurance Assn. of America was trying to "stop 
health care reform at all costs." 
</P>
<P>
 While the insurers rolled out their ads, Health and Human Services Secretary 
Donna Shalala released new statistics indicating that 17.2% of Americans under 
age 65 were uninsured in 1992, up from 12.5% in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 And employers spent $1.10 per worker per hour on health insurance in 1993, up 
from 92 cents an hour in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Shalala said middle-class families like Harry and Louise are at greater risk 
of losing their insurance every day.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The White House began implementing President Clinton's national service plan 
Monday, announcing the first batch of community programs providing jobs and 
money for higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs will place 7,000 people in projects in 47 states and the District 
of Columbia, funded by $47 million from the federally financed Corp. for 
National Service. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the year, up to 200 programs employing 20,000 people are 
expected to be in place. The programs -- in education, public safety, health 
and the environment -- are selected through a competitive process on a 
state-by-state basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as Americorps, the initiative is billed as a new domestic Peace Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for work, Americorps members will receive a minimum-wage stipend and 
an education grant worth nearly $5,000 per year for up to two years.

GUNMAN SLAIN AFTER KILLING 4, WOUNDING 19 AT AF BASE; CRIME: RAMPAGE AT 
HOSPITAL BY MILITARY MAN IS THE BLOODIEST IN HISTORY OF SPOKANE, WASH. TEN 
PEOPLE REMAIN IN CRITICAL CONDITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the bloodiest shooting rampage in this city's history, a gunman toting an 
assault rifle marched into the Fairchild Air Force Base hospital and opened 
fire Monday, killing four people and wounding 19 others before he was slain by 
a military police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified assailant sprayed random gunfire from an AK-47 as he strode 
through the base emergency room, into the hospital and a three-story annex, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman, a military man assigned to the base, was shot and killed a short 
time later by a base police officer on bicycle patrol in the hospital's parking 
lot. The grisly scene unfolded before more than 100 witnesses shortly after 3 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the dead man carried military identification, but his 
military affiliation was unclear. No motive was immediately apparent for the 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two children were among the injured, including a 4-year-old boy who 
remained in critical condition after undergoing surgery late Monday at a 
Spokane-area hospital. Nine others were listed in critical condition at area 
hospitals. Names of the dead and injured were withheld pending notification of 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were wounds in arms, legs, abdomens and chests," said Dr. Greg Jones, 
an emergency room physician at Deaconess Medical Center. "Fortunately, we had 
no head wounds." 
</P>
<P>
 A witness, Todd Boyle, heard gunshots and glanced out the window of his 
apartment to see a man clad in black drop to the ground amid dust clouds raised 
by bullets striking the dirt near his feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was real crazy out there," Boyle said. "There was a lot of screaming and 
people were ducking behind cars. A medic dove into a dumpster for cover. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police approached the man in black from all angles. He was dead and bloody 
from his shoulders up. A rifle was lying next to the body," said Boyle, a 
senior aircraft mechanic stationed at Fairchild. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca Vanover, who also lives in military housing opposite the hospital, 
rushed to her window after hearing "popping noises that kept getting nearer and 
nearer." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a madhouse, and it was too close for comfort," Vanover said. "People 
were running all over the place. Kids were screaming. Sirens were going off. 
Police were breaking windows at the annex. I've never seen so many helicopters 
overhead." 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting sent law enforcement and emergency medical crews scrambling to 
the scene in firetrucks, helicopters and ambulances from communities as far as 
26 miles away, Spokane Fire Department Dispatcher Luke Cussins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We activated a multi-agency disaster plan for mass casualty incidents that 
had been drilled and revised for years, but never used," Cussins said. "Things 
went very smoothly for us." 
</P>
<P>
 "Several of the victims are women and children and some of the children are 
critical," added Cussins. In all, he said, 16 people were "transported to 
Sacred Heart Medical Center, Deaconess Medical Center, Holy Family Hospital and 
Valley General Hospital -- that's every hospital in the region." 
</P>
<P>
 "Things were pretty fast-paced here," said Pam Pyrc, spokeswoman for 
Deaconess, where six people, including the 4-year-old boy and a 12-year-old 
boy, were admitted for treatment of gunshot wounds. Three of the injured were 
in critical condition, and three others were in serious condition, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three people were treated at the scene for minor injuries, Pyrc said. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial reports of a second gunman forced emergency helicopters to circle the 
scene for nearly an hour as law enforcement authorities, including FBI agents 
and military SWAT teams, searched the hospital grounds and evacuated nearby 
housing units, Cussins said. Those reports turned out to be erroneous. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairchild Air Force Base, 10 miles west of Spokane, is a former bomber base 
that is being converted to an air refueling base as part of military 
downsizing.

8 PEOPLE KILLED BY LIGHTNING IN VIRGINIA, OKLAHOMA, N.Y. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five members of a West Virginia family on a boating trip were killed by 
lightning after they made the mistake of seeking shelter under a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oklahoma City, lightning struck three men who were playing golf Sunday, 
killing two of them, and in New York, lightning struck at least six beach-goers 
trying to flee a thunderstorm, killing one. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims in Virginia were killed last Thursday on an island in Lake Moomaw 
and were found Friday by a fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one heck of a bolt to jolt them like that," said Bath County Sheriff's 
Lt. Noel Dunnagan. "The pine bark was split all the way down." 
</P>
<P>
 They were identified as Harrison Lee Christian, 46; his wife, Sheila K. 
Christian, 37; and their son, Matthew Zeph Christian, 10. Also killed were 
Harrison Christian's uncle, Robert Chester Johnson, whose age was unavailable, 
and his wife, Marjorie E. Johnson, 63. The Christians were from Camden on 
Gauley, W. Va., and the Johnsons lived in Princeton, W. Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking shelter under trees in thunderstorms is dangerous, said Charles 
Edwards of the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rule is, 'don't get under a tree,' " Edwards said. "Lightning strikes at 
the highest peak." 
</P>
<P>
 In Oklahoma, Don Grace, 53, and Martin Ryan, 51, were killed when their golf 
cart was struck by lightning. A third passenger was treated at a hospital for 
minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 In the borough of Queens in New York, lightning struck the beach-goers Sunday 
as they packed up their belongings during a storm. An unidentified man in his 
20s was killed and at least five others were injured.

BLAZE AT HOME OF BLACK FAMILY TIED TO CIGARETTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A smoldering cigarette, not a firebomb, started the blaze that burned a black 
family out of its Oak View home two weeks ago, Ventura County investigators 
concluded Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 After an intensive probe that involved a trained dog sniffing for fuel, 
firefighters sifting through ashes and researchers analyzing shards of window 
glass, fire and police officials said they found no evidence of arson. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members say they still believe the fire was a race-provoked hate crime 
started by an incendiary device thrown through their front window. 
</P>
<P>
 But a team of firefighters and police officers said they could not support 
that theory. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing to indicate that it was flammable liquid" that caused the 
fire, said Sandi Wells, spokeswoman for the Ventura County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The June 7 fire caused $150,000 in damage and left 13-year-old Shuwana 
Stanford with first- and second-degree burns on her face. Six months before the 
fire, Shuwana had withdrawn from Matilija Junior High School after being the 
target of racial taunts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can say what they want," Winnie Stanford, Shuwana's grandmother, said of 
the firefighters' report. "All I know is she doesn't smoke."

HOUSE PANEL TO EXAMINE FAA ACTIONS ON 757 DANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BRAZIL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A congressional subcommittee will convene a hearing next month to determine 
whether the Federal Aviation Administration ignored safety warnings involving 
Boeing 757 jetliners until after the deaths of 13 people, federal officials 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying the FAA has a history of not acting until after a tragedy, Rep. Tom 
Lewis (R-Fla.), the ranking Republican on the House subcommittee on technology, 
environment and aviation, said he called for the hearing because he believes 
the FAA may have put the airline industry's well-being over the public's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really frustrated with the FAA over this thing," Lewis said. "I passed 
legislation -- the Catastrophic Failure Prevention Act -- that's supposed to 
require them to look at these kinds of things before they happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis added, "This tombstone technology attitude of the FAA does not seem to 
want to go away." 
</P>
<P>
 Two crashes, including a Dec. 15, 1993, accident in Santa Ana that killed two 
In-N-Out Burger chain executives, occurred after private aircraft encountered 
"horizontal tornadoes" caused by 757 jetliners. Although aviation experts 
disagree on the degree of the hazard, the 757's unique, fuel-efficient design 
creates windstorms emanating from each wingtip that are more powerful and last 
longer than those made by other aircraft its size. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported earlier this month that the FAA's top scientist, Robert E. 
Machol, had issued warnings on the 757 danger as far back as 1990. It was that 
report that prompted Lewis' call for the hearing, he said.

ABUSED CHILDREN STAYING LONGER IN O.C. SHELTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orangewood Children's Home has to shelter abused children almost twice as 
long as it did a decade ago, creating severe overcrowding conditions at the 
263-bed facility, a new county study has found. 
</P>
<P>
 And most of the children being sheltered there for two months or more suffer 
from such severe problems that it's nearly impossible to find foster homes for 
them, according to a Social Services Agency report released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to address the overcrowding problem, Orange County Supervisor 
William G. Steiner asked the Social Services Agency to conduct a comprehensive 
study of factors affecting the length of time that children typically spend 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation has become so dire in recent years that the staff at the 
children's home has been forced at times to scramble just to find enough cots 
and cribs for the children. 
</P>
<P>
 The chronic overcrowding reflects the rapid increase in child abuse reports, 
which doubled between 1985 and 1993 to nearly 37,000 reported cases, according 
to the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel like we're walking on a tightrope," Steiner said Monday. "What we are 
talking about today is probably the tip of the iceberg." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the study, 263 substance-addicted babies were admitted to 
Orangewood in 1993 -- a dramatic increase over previous years, says Steiner, 
formerly Orangewood director. 
</P>
<P>
 The study further found that 500 of the 2,452 children admitted in 1992 
remained in the county-run shelter for more than two months because social 
workers could not find a relative, foster or group home to take them. 
</P>
<P>
 One in five of these children was described as suicidal, 20% were taking 
medication for mental illness, 12% had been hospitalized in a mental 
institution and half had a variety of medical problems resulting from cigarette 
burns, beatings, sexual molestation and general neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . The children coming into Orangewood in recent years are more and more 
disturbed, difficult, behaviorally aggressive" and "out of control," the report 
stated. "Some fail placement after placement and 'burn out' all of the 
placement resources." 
</P>
<P>
 They include children such as a 15-year-old girl from Tustin who found herself 
a reluctant guest at Orangewood when her stepfather was arrested for the double 
murder of her mother and a step-sibling two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 According to social workers, the girl steals, skips school, runs away and 
sometimes threatens suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Social services officials have tried to place her with foster parents four 
times. But on each occasion she has been sent back to Orangewood because of 
severe behavioral problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The study further concluded that one quarter of the children who remain at 
Orangewood longer than 60 days belong in the juvenile justice system, but there 
is no room for them because the available programs are already swamped with 
hard-core teen-age offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The study detailed a variety of factors that often delay the placement of 
children in foster homes -- increasing the time that they must spend at 
Orangewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the children in Orangewood have siblings there, while 16% belong to 
families having three to seven children. Since social workers try to keep 
children together whenever possible, larger families pose difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the numbers of Latino children requiring placement have doubled in 
six years. They now number 36% of the children at Orangewood. However, only 12% 
of foster homes have Latino-surnamed parents, and not all of those foster 
parents are fluent in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the number of licensed foster care beds has decreased 22% in 
six years. Group home beds in Orange County are also in short supply, with the 
result that 26% of the children have to be placed out of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orangewood Director Bob Theemling says having the same number of beds as 
there are needy children is not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not easy to find the right match," Theemling said. "And to find the best 
match you can, you need to have choices -- at least twice as many beds as 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 The study offered a variety of recommendations for combatting the problem of 
overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
 They included: 
</P>
<P>
 * Launching an aggressive recruitment program for foster parents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Providing additional resources for adoption when it is unlikely that 
children will be reunited with their natural parents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Refocusing efforts and resources on outreach programs to prevent child 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Social Services officials said they plan to ask the county for $350,000 to use 
for foster parent recruitment. 
</P>
<P>
 The study's findings were praised by children's advocates who have long argued 
that the county should channel more money into anti-poverty programs rather 
than expand the current Orangewood facility. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, the county spent $4 million to expand Orangewood. The study found, 
however, that the average stay has doubled since then -- all but negating the 
effect of the extra beds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that we've been pushing for a long while," said Sandy 
Sladen, director of community services for the Children's Bureau of Southern 
California. "The best way to prevent child abuse is to teach people to be good 
parents so their children are never abused and they never see the inside of 
Orangewood." 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit agency was recently awarded a $450,000 grant over three years to 
launch a program to help combat child abuse. The program is one of six funded 
by the state Department of Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think in the past, we've been so overwhelmed by responding to the pain of 
child abuse that we haven't focused attention on what causes child abuse in the 
first place," Sladen said. "I think now we're getting the first movement in 
that direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Oliver, director of the Orange County Child Abuse Prevention Council, 
agreed: "In terms of the work we do, it's clear that what we really need to 
focus on is early intervention to help preserve families." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Nelson, the executive director of the Orangewood Children's Foundation, 
also stressed what many called a changing approach to dealing with child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we did for many years was raise money to build Orangewood," Nelson said. 
"But putting an Orangewood on every corner wouldn't be enough. To prevent the 
abuse, you need to teach people about child abuse." Longer Stays at Orangewood 
</P>
<P>
 Children with severe emotional, physical and behavioral problems are staying 
longer than the usual 60 days at Orangewood Children's Home. The average stay 
has doubled in the past 15 years. In 1992: 
</P>
<P>
 * About 500 children out of 2,452 admitted stayed longer than 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 * One in five was suicidal and on psychiatric medication. 
</P>
<P>
 * Twelve percent had a history of being hospitalized for psychiatric reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nearly one-third were aggressive or violent with this behavior shown at a 
younger age. 
</P>
<P>
 * Half had a variety of medical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * One-fourth of those who stayed longer than 60 days belonged in the juvenile 
justice system, but stayed put because there was no room in Juvenile Hall.

RAMS, JILTED BY O.C., COURTED BY BALTIMORE; FOOTBALL: FORMER HOME OF COLTS 
WANTS A NEW TEAM, BELIEVES LURING CLUB CAN BE A BOON TO LOCAL ECONOMY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There's a beautiful view of the baseball jewel that is Oriole Park at Camden 
Yards. But as Peter Angelos peers out his office window, his thoughts are on 
football and Southern California, where few seem to sympathize with the 
financial struggles of an NFL team he's trying to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on what I've read, it seems Anaheim and Orange County public officials 
are not prepared to make any particular contribution or sacrifice to retain the 
Rams, and I respect that," said Angelos, the Baltimore Orioles' majority owner 
who is spearheading efforts to lure a football team here. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a decision they have a right to make, and they're obliged to make it 
since they represent the public. Maybe the people in Orange County are wiser . 
. . but the attitude here is completely opposite." 
</P>
<P>
 Still stinging from the Baltimore Colts' move to Indianapolis in 1984, the 
state is ready to build a stadium, fans are poised to buy tickets and sell out 
expensive luxury suites and club seats, and the governor of Maryland has made 
personal appeals for a football team. 
</P>
<P>
 "What differentiates us from so many cities is our elected officials treat 
sports franchises as economic development," said Herb Belgrad, chairman of the 
Maryland Stadium Authority. "And we have the numbers to support it." 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore's gung-ho approach could pay off. Ten days ago, Angelos met with 
Rams officials, and last week he said a deal to bring the Rams to Baltimore in 
1995 was a possibility within nine weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 With just such a deal in mind, the Maryland General Assembly has kept a 
$160-million financing package, using a mixture of tax-free bonds and special 
lottery revenue, in place to construct a football stadium in Camden Yards 
should Baltimore land a team. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar financing deal was passed to construct the $105-million baseball 
stadium, which opened near downtown's Inner Harbor in 1992 and has been widely 
acclaimed for its traditional design, intimate feel and state-of-the-art 
features. 
</P>
<P>
 The total statewide economic effect of the Orioles' first season at Camden 
Yards was $226 million in gross sales, $77 million in employee income and the 
equivalent of 2,340 jobs, according to a Maryland Department of Economic and 
Employment Development Office study. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide tax receipts from the 1992 baseball season were $9.4 million, and 
local tax receipts totaled $6.4 million. Tourism in Baltimore increased 12% 
from 1991 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are very significant figures when you consider our tax base is eroding 
and when you have unemployment," said Belgrad, who headed an unsuccessful bid 
to land an NFL expansion team for the city last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The intangible benefits are significant as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the stadium has done for the city's pride and excitement is 
unbelievable," Belgrad said. "People come downtown all summer, you see them 
emerging from their offices and going to the park, and they're happy, enjoying 
themselves. Isn't that what a city's all about? 
</P>
<P>
 "The stadium has revitalized the downtown area, and it attracts tourists, so 
it's difficult to understand why other cities don't appreciate those benefits. 
They think, 'Uh-oh, there's going to be more taxes going to help some rich 
owner.' But the benefits are many." 
</P>
<P>
 A 1991 state study estimated that an NFL team in Baltimore would generate $86 
million a year for the local economy, and Angelos believes Baltimore fans, 
jilted when their beloved Colts left for Indianapolis in 1984, would welcome 
another team. 
</P>
<P>
 The local enthusiasm for football in Baltimore is not mirrored in Anaheim. 
Although a group of civic boosters was formed last week to work to keep the 
Rams in Orange County and Newport Beach-based sports agent Leigh Steinberg said 
he would also join the fight, a recent Times Orange County poll suggests that 
the group faces an uphill struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll of 600 registered voters showed 75% oppose county government 
"financial assistance" to keep the Rams, and 68% feel keeping the Rams is 
unimportant to them personally. Some 37% say the team is unimportant to the 
local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 While negotiating to buy a minority interest in the Rams, Angelos is also 
attempting to purchase the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts "are still a tradition here," said Angelos, an attorney whose firm 
has settled about $750 million in asbestos-related suits in the last decade. 
"They're like an heirloom that someone spirited away -- it's gone, and people 
want it back. (The NFL effort) has gotten larger than just having a pro 
football team here. It has become a restoration of civic pride." 
</P>
<P>
 But can the Rams or another NFL team replace the Colts in the hearts of 
Baltimore fans? Baltimore Sun columnist John Steadman, who wrote four books on 
the Colts and attended every Colts game, home and away, from 1950-84, isn't so 
sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long ago, someone called Baltimore a big Green Bay, and that was right," 
Steadman said. "There was a euphoria for the home team that gave you reason to 
wonder what fans' priorities were. People used to name their children after 
Colt players. They had a stake in the games like they owned the club or were a 
part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't think you'll ever see that kind of affection and enthusiasm for a 
team here again. Had we gotten an expansion team, I think fans would have felt 
they'd grow up with the team and be a part of it. But going after the Rams, it 
seems they'd lose a little bit of that ability to say they're ours." 
</P>
<P>
 The passion for football -- even if it isn't the Colts -- remains, though. 
During the recent NFL expansion race, Baltimore was the first of five cities to 
sell out all of its luxury suites (100) and club seats (7,500) in the proposed 
stadium. Charlotte and Jacksonville eventually were awarded teams. 
</P>
<P>
 A new Canadian Football League team in Baltimore, called the CFL Colts, has 
sold about 20,000 season tickets as its inaugural season approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's summer football," Angelos said. "You look at that reaction, and 
you have to say to yourself, 'Is there any better market for football?' I say 
no. This is football country." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos is confident that if Baltimore can attract an NFL team and the city 
builds a stadium to rival Oriole Park at Camden Yards, fans will flock to 
football games as they do to baseball games -- the Orioles ranked fourth in 
Major League attendance last year, attracting more than 3.6 million fans, and 
most games in the 47,000-seat stadium are sold out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a festive kind of situation down there," Angelos said. "People are all 
caught up in it. They like coming here. . . . I'd like to see an NFL team 
become part of the community like the Orioles are in the process of becoming." 
</P>
<P>
 Some have wondered why Angelos would want to buy a minority interest in the 
Rams -- why he'd spend millions for a share of a team he'd basically have no 
control over. 
</P>
<P>
 But Angelos said his primary goal is to land an NFL team and complete the 
Camden Yards sports complex, which, according to plans developed seven years 
ago, calls for a football stadium to go with the baseball facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something urban areas should do throughout the country because it's 
good for the economy, it's good for young and old people, and you're doing 
something that is not commonplace," Angelos said. "And isn't it about time we 
did these things in this country? 
</P>
<P>
 "Thirty years ago when everyone's banner was flying, this country was going to 
do all these things. But this country has stood still for too long. The Camden 
Yards project is something we need to finish, so we can hold it out as an 
example for others to follow. That's a part of America we should be 
showcasing."

'RED OCTOBER' AUTHOR IN HUNT FOR RAMS; FOOTBALL: BEST-SELLING WRITER TOM 
CLANCY, A BALTIMORE-BORN FOOTBALL FAN, IS WILLING TO SPEND MILLIONS IN HELPING 
THE EFFORT TO PUT AN NFL TEAM BACK IN HIS HOMETOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 His bid for Patriot games fell short, but author Tom Clancy is still in the 
hunt for a blue-and-gold October -- and September, November and December, for 
that matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Had former New England Patriots owner James Orthwein not kept his promise to 
give local investors the first chance to buy his team, Clancy might not be 
pursuing the Rams today. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Patriots were sold to Foxboro Stadium owner Robert Kraft for $155 
million in January, even though Clancy's group reportedly offered several 
million more to buy the team and move it to Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame from my point of view because it was a sweetheart deal," said 
Clancy, who has reached the top of the New York Times bestseller list with all 
seven of his novels. "But (Orthwein) is an honorable man and did the honorable 
thing . . . damn!" 
</P>
<P>
 You can feel the passion for football in Clancy's voice. He's a minority owner 
of the Baltimore Orioles, but baseball hasn't quenched his thirst for sports. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Clancy has joined Oriole owner Peter Angelos in an effort to 
purchase a minority interest in the Rams and move them to Baltimore. The group 
also is negotiating with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football is my first love," said Clancy, who was born in Baltimore the same 
year (1947) the Colts began play in the NFL. "I didn't miss a Colts game 
growing up, and I wasn't real pleased when they left (for Indianapolis in 
1984). I had just gotten my dad's season tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 As a fourth-grader, Clancy used to attend the same Mass at St. Matthew's 
Catholic Church as Hall-of-Fame Colt quarterback Johnny Unitas. He still has 
vivid memories of watching the storied 1958 NFL championship game on 
television, when Alan Ameche scored on a goal-line plunge to give the Colts a 
23-17 overtime victory over the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was 40 degrees and overcast that day in Baltimore," Clancy said. "I 
remember it well." 
</P>
<P>
 He's willing to pay millions to create more football memories by luring an NFL 
team to Baltimore, where a new $160-million stadium in Camden Yards and, Clancy 
believes, unparalleled support awaits. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if an NFL team would be successful in Baltimore, Clancy replied: "Does 
the sun rise in the East? These people want football. Baltimore has always been 
a good football town. Robert Irsay (Colt owner who moved the team) destroyed 
that, but enlightened management shouldn't have any trouble selling the place 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Clancy, whose credits include techno-thrillers such as "The Hunt for Red 
October," "Patriot Games" and "Red Storm Rising," didn't play football as a 
youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't big enough," he said. "And I was a crummy baseball player, too." 
</P>
<P>
 But like so many Baltimore fans, Clancy, 47, developed a fierce loyalty to the 
Colts and a strong attachment to football, bonds that continue to motivate him. 
</P>
<P>
 With the commercial success of his novels, several of which were made into 
movies, Clancy has all the money he could ever want. But he won't be truly 
happy until the NFL returns to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't ever want to be satisfied with anything," said Clancy, whose next 
book, "Debt of Honor," is due out in August. "If you're not trying to move 
forward, do better, you're dead. Progress is based on dissatisfaction, so from 
that standpoint, I'm somewhat dissatisfied." 
</P>
<P>
 So is Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke, who believes an NFL team in 
Baltimore would impinge on his plans to build a new stadium in Laurel, Md., 
about 20 miles south of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooke has said he needs the corporate support of both Baltimore and Washington 
to fill 300 luxury suites proposed in the Laurel stadium, but Clancy believes 
the Redskin owner is targeting the wrong market. 
</P>
<P>
 "I once said I'd rather sell my children to Gypsies than let them be Redskin 
fans," Clancy said. "That's pretty much how people here feel. For them, the 
Redskins don't exist. For Cooke's own business purposes, I think he's making a 
mistake. He has a lot more fans in Virginia than he does in Maryland." 
</P>
<P>
 Clancy and Angelos expect Cooke to lobby against Baltimore as a relocation 
site, and if such a move isn't approved by three-fourths of NFL owners, an ugly 
legal battle, such as the one Al Davis fought to move his Raiders from Oakland 
to Los Angeles, could ensue. 
</P>
<P>
 But to Clancy, neither Cooke nor the NFL poses a clear and present danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peter Angelos is one of the premier trial attorneys in the U.S.," Clancy 
said. "If anyone wants to drag him into court, that's like dragging a tiger out 
of a cage. It's a low-percentage move."

LAW PROPOSED TO CRACK DOWN ON FALSE ALARM CALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles police would not respond to automated burglar alarms until the 
alarm company or the building occupants verified that the building had been 
broken into, under a law Councilman Marvin Braude proposed Monday to crack down 
on false alarm calls that divert police from real crime. 
</P>
<P>
 About 95% of the 161,000 security alarms that Los Angeles police responded to 
last year turned out to be false, triggered by human error, faulty equipment or 
bad weather, according to police and city officials. The needless responses 
cost about $6 million to $8 million in wasted work-hours, police officials have 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, which was approved Monday by the council's Public Safety Committee, 
was criticized by an alarm industry representative, who said the verification 
requirement would substantially increase the cost of alarm systems, putting 
them out of reach for many business and home owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Les Gold, an attorney representing the California Alarm Assn. and the Los 
Angeles Burglar and Fire Alarm Assn., said the city should at least phase in 
the requirement gradually. 
</P>
<P>
 "The preponderance of the companies do not have the ability to do it," he said 
in an interview after the committee meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Braude's proposal, which will be considered by the entire council within the 
next two weeks, would also make it a more serious crime for alarm system users 
to fail to register the system with police. The law would increase the offense 
from an infraction, punishable by a fine of no more than $50 on a first 
offense, to a misdemeanor, punishable by a year in jail and a fine up to 
$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is the latest effort by city officials to reduce the thousands of 
false alarm calls that police must respond to annually. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, Councilwoman Laura Chick and Police Commissioner Art Mattox 
introduced a proposed law that would impose an $80 fine on owners of alarm 
systems after the third false call within a 12-month period. Currently, the $80 
fine starts after the fourth false alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 That law would also crack down on alarm systems that are not registered with 
police by establishing an $80 fine for each false alarm by non-registered 
systems. The annual registration fee is $30. 
</P>
<P>
 That proposal is still awaiting a hearing by the full council. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Assistant City Atty. Byron Boeckman, the alarms could be verified 
in one of three ways: by an armed patrol unit working for the alarm company; by 
an employee of the business or owner of the home using the system; or by alarm 
company employees watching the property on video monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Once it was verified that the alarm was genuine, police would respond to the 
call, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braude law would also require alarm companies to show police a list of 
their customers so police can easily contact the companies when an alarm is 
triggered, Boeckman said. Such lists would also help the city identify which 
alarm system owners had not paid the city's $30 permit fee. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100,000 security systems are registered in the city of Los Angeles, but 
city officials and alarm company representatives estimate there are another 
200,000 unregistered systems, costing the city $6 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold said the alarm industry does not oppose the verification element of the 
law but asks that the city slowly phase it in so alarm companies can have time 
to meet the requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, if the city does not have the police to respond to the calls, 
someone should do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold also criticized the idea of making it a misdemeanor to fail to register 
an alarm system, saying the penalty is too harsh. 
</P>
<P>
 The alarm industry is fighting back at attempts to crack down on false alarms 
by backing proposed state legislation that would limit the penalties local 
municipalities can impose on alarm system owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold said the industry backs the state legislation because municipalities are 
imposing steep penalties that would make it too expensive for most people to 
own an alarm system.

PERSISTENCE PAYS OFF FOR BATTERED WOMAN; ABUSE: CHOKED AND BEATEN, VICTIM 
FIGHTS THROUGH LEGAL PROCESS. HER ASSAILANT RECEIVES A STIFF SENTENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In jail, after he'd had some time to reflect on the mess he was in, Jose Maria 
Martinez wrote the mother of his son a letter. 
</P>
<P>
 She had told the cops that Martinez had beaten the hell out of her -- dragged 
her off the bed, pinned her to the floor, choked her until she nearly lost 
consciousness and then whacked her on both sides of the head to revive her. In 
all, she said, he slapped and punched her about 30 times in 45 minutes. The 
police had hauled him off to jail -- after chasing him for half a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter, he pleaded with her not to press charges. He urged her to 
explain it all away by saying he'd been drinking. He told her to lie for him. 
"All this is going to be drop if you do what I say," he wrote of the charges he 
was facing. "You the only person who can help me and get me off." 
</P>
<P>
 For once, Claudia Clark was not moved. Finally, the painful truth had hit her: 
"You can't let them keep beating on you and beating on you. Because, one day, 
they're going to end up killing you." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark resolved to really tough it out. She decided to press charges against 
the father of her 4-year-old son. "This time," she said in an interview, "he 
was going down. Not me." 
</P>
<P>
 That anger and determination launched a process that vividly underscores the 
formidable obstacles -- some practical, others emotional -- that a battered 
woman encounters in going to court. The process took many weeks. But it 
produced a result that illustrates how the much-maligned court system can still 
exact justice -- if a woman is willing to believe in it and in herself. 
</P>
<P>
 The same day she was beaten, a couple of days before last Christmas, Clark had 
to endure the humiliation of submitting to police photographs that documented 
the angry red welts on her neck. That night, she suffered the indignities of a 
medical examination. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few weeks, she met and had to confide in a prosecutor. Her phone 
had been turned off, so she had to attend every court hearing -- if only so she 
would know when the next hearing was. That meant baby-sitters for the boy and 
long bus rides across the San Fernando Valley from her North Hollywood 
apartment. The baby-sitters and the bus rides cost money, which she didn't have 
much of, living on welfare and food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 She had to be patient; the Jan. 17 earthquake scrambled schedules at the Van 
Nuys courthouse. Finally, when the case did go to trial, she had to testify 
against Martinez, to publicly confess and confront the shame of being a victim 
and the fear of retribution. And, of course, she had to trust that 12 strangers 
would believe her version of the story, not his. 
</P>
<P>
 At the trial Martinez maintained his innocence, but a Municipal Court jury 
convicted him of four counts, including spousal abuse. And, a few days ago, 
Judge Lloyd Nash sentenced Martinez to four years and 11 months behind bars, 
believed by the city attorney's office to be the longest sentence ever handed 
down in Los Angeles in a misdemeanor domestic violence case. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Jeffrey M. Harkavy, who prosecuted the case, said the 
average sentence for such a crime is considerably shorter. A first offense 
typically might result in a sentence as light as community service to as tough 
as six months in jail, Harkavy said. A second offense might bring up to a year 
in jail, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "More women should come forward and know that the system treats these cases 
seriously," Nash, who has been on the bench about five years, said in an 
interview in his chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 He cautioned, "Not all cases require this type of sentence. But some cases cry 
out for the maximum sentence. And this case is one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez could not be reached for comment. His defense attorney, Van Nuys 
lawyer Christopher P. Nance, declined a request for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, now 25, had been convicted of beating Clark once before, in 1991. 
For that, he received 30 days in jail, six months of counseling and two years 
probation. He also had pulled two stretches in state prison, both for 
drug-related crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been on parole for only a few weeks when he beat Clark, now 26, for the 
last time. The beating took place on Dec. 23, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy," Harkavy said, "is bad to the core." 
</P>
<P>
 When she first met Martinez, Clark said, he seemed so different. He was a 
talented artist. He was charming. And he obviously had the hots for her. In the 
summer of 1989, they moved in together, but never married. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon she was pregnant. And then things got ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 When she was three months pregnant, she said, he asked if another woman could 
move in with them. She declined. He insisted. No way, she said. He got mad. 
With steel-pointed shoes, he kicked her in the stomach. She said he also 
punched her and gave her a bloody lip. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he apologized. 
</P>
<P>
 When the baby, who was born without any apparent damage from the kick, was 3 
months old, the car refused to start. Martinez clenched the wheel. "What's 
wrong?" Clark said. He erupted, she said, punching her in the right eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a flash of light," she said. "I went blind for a month." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he apologized. 
</P>
<P>
 Another time, she said, she was holding the baby over her shoulder when he hit 
her. The force sent the baby's head smacking into the wall.  
</P>
<P>
 He apologized. 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, Clark said, he beat her regularly. "He hit me, like, every week, 
sometimes twice a week," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, he would always apologize. "He wrote the book on apologies," she 
said. Inevitably, she said, she would take him back -- hoping that things would 
change between them and, more than that, that he would provide for his son. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she said, "He never worked, nothing." Instead, he did time behind bars. 
She survived on food stamps and welfare checks. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, Martinez was released from prison. Clark allowed him to see their 
son and, sometimes, to sleep on the couch. She was wary of having him around 
yet hopeful: "He is the father of the baby. Who's gonna take care of the son if 
it's not the father?" 
</P>
<P>
 Clark was insistent that there be no sex. She was so adamant that she slept in 
her clothes. "That's what got him mad," she said. "I didn't want to be with 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Early on the morning of Dec. 23, a knocking sound echoed through the 
apartment. Clark thought it was the downstairs neighbors getting ready for 
work. Martinez said it was her boyfriend at the door, a man named Juan. She 
said that was silly. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no one and no Juan in her life, she told him. He didn't believe it. 
Enraged, he went to the kitchen, grabbed a butter knife and plunged it into the 
pillow just a couple of inches from her head, according to her testimony at the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, she testified, he dragged her out of bed, got on top of her with his 
knees pinning her elbows and put his hands to her throat. She felt she was 
passing out. He hit her head to revive her. 
</P>
<P>
 It went on like this, she said, for more than half an hour -- until their 
child, who was also in the room, finally woke up. "Look what you do," she said 
she told Martinez. "You do this in front of your son."  
</P>
<P>
 That got him off of her, she said, and she dashed for the window, sliding the 
glass pane open with one hand and punching the screen out with the other. She 
wriggled out to a balcony and then down stairs, to a pay phone, where she 
called 911. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, she said, when she saw Martinez leave the house, she went back 
inside. She received a phone call from Martinez, who said, "I'm going to come 
back and finish you off," Harkavy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrived, and, after a half-mile chase on foot, arrested Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that morning, the thought dawned on her: "If the father is going to be 
like this, better the son doesn't have a father. My son deserves better than 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 So, she realized, did she. "A man hitting a woman -- there ain't no excuse, 
really." 
</P>
<P>
 It was that notion that fueled her determination to pursue the court case. It 
also sustained her through the emotional turmoil of what was to come. 
</P>
<P>
 At the police station, as the flashbulbs snapped, "it was humiliating," Clark 
said. "I felt so stupid. I had let him do that, and here were these officers so 
sorry for me." 
</P>
<P>
 At the hospital, she had to explain what happened all over again: "I had to 
walk around with these marks on my neck." 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of weeks later, Martinez sent her a letter from jail. In the letter, 
which later became part of the court record, he wrote, "I'm going crazy 
thinking about the problems I have right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Drop the charges or get them dropped, he wrote. "I pray for that," the letter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He closed it by writing, "I'm sorry for all I making you go through." 
</P>
<P>
 She was untouched. "I read it and said, 'Yeah, right.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few weeks, it was back and forth to court. Each visit meant 
hiring one of the neighbor women to baby-sit, at $1 per hour. Each way on the 
bus was $1.10. On a welfare check of $490 per month, the dollars and dimes 
started to add up. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark had to go visit the courthouse more times than she had expected, often 
just to learn that the case had been postponed. And because of the quake, there 
were a lot of postponements. 
</P>
<P>
 The sensible thing, of course, would have been to call the court. But her 
phone had been disconnected because, she said, Martinez had made calls and left 
her with a bill she couldn't afford. 
</P>
<P>
 When the trial came, Clark said, the city attorney's office arranged for her 
to take a cab to the courthouse. When she took the stand, she was numb. "I 
didn't have no feelings for the guy anymore," she said. "I just didn't feel 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez followed her to the stand. He denied assaulting her. He did, however, 
concede that he tried to run away from the officers. "He did that, he said, 
because she liked to make stories up about him and get him in trouble," Harkavy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor added, "In my opinion, Mr. Martinez was lying through his teeth 
when he testified." 
</P>
<P>
 After a four-day trial, the jury came back in a bit over two hours with guilty 
verdicts on all four misdemeanor counts: spousal abuse, false imprisonment, 
making threats to kill and resisting arrest.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors did not pursue felony charges. In large part, Harkavy said, that 
was because Clark forgot at first to tell officers about the stab into the 
pillow with the knife, which might have been charged as a felony assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Misdemeanors carry a maximum of one year in jail. On May 26, Nash sentenced 
Martinez to a year on each of the four counts, then tacked on an extra 11 
months for a probation violation linked to the 1991 assault on Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 She welcomed the lengthy term, saying there is security in having him behind 
bars -- though if he racks up credits for good behavior, he's unlikely to do 
all four years, 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The longer, the better, she said. But she stressed: "I wasn't out to get him. 
He was out to get me."

REMAINS LINKED TO MISSING SUSPECT; CRIME: POLICE WORK TO IDENTIFY A BODY FOUND 
IN THE WRECKAGE OF A TRUCK THAT BELONGED TO A MAN WANTED IN A 1993 SLAYING. 
</P>

<P>
 The wreckage of a pickup truck and possibly the human remains inside -- both 
found in a deep ravine near Castaic this weekend -- belonged to the suspect in 
a 1993 San Fernando Valley murder, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 18 months ago, a 27-year-old man named Christ James Wetzel was fatally 
shot in the garage of a Northridge house, allegedly by his friend Mark Douglas 
Snyder, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said that after the shooting Snyder drove off in a green pickup 
truck. He was never seen again. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, detectives from the Los Angeles Police Department's Devonshire 
Division confirmed that the truck spotted by forest rangers off the Templin 
Highway -- Iowa license plates, white camper shell and all -- was the one in 
which Snyder fled. 
</P>
<P>
 Still unconfirmed are whether the skeletal remains in and around the truck are 
Snyder's as well and, if so, how he died. Police said they were working with 
Snyder's sister to obtain dental records, and a spokesman for the Los Angeles 
County coroner's office said an anthropologist will examine the bones within 
the next week in an effort to positively identify them and determine the cause 
of death. 
</P>
<P>
 If the remains are those of Snyder, who lived in Winnetka, they would mark the 
tragic end of the life of a 29-year-old man tortured by the death of his 
father, Gary Snyder, a Van Nuys resident who barricaded himself and then died 
in 1989 as police stormed his house with a battering ram, detectives and 
friends said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been pretty distraught ever since," said one friend, who watched as 
officers worked to retrieve the pickup truck wreckage Monday and asked not to 
be named. 
</P>
<P>
 He and another friend of Snyder's, Shawn Stone, said they always believed the 
younger Snyder had killed himself after Wetzel's murder. They even suggested to 
authorities at the time of the murder investigation that if Snyder committed 
suicide he might have done it in the Castaic area, where he often hiked and 
camped. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loved this area," said Stone, who said he witnessed the shooting of Wetzel 
and called the police. "We told the detectives they'd find him up here dead. We 
thought it would be with a bullet in the head." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Detective Tom Broad, the Devonshire Division's chief 
homicide investigator, said police contacted local campgrounds after the 
slaying to see if the pickup truck was registered there and checked again 
several times over the last year and a half. They did not physically search the 
area because it is too vast, Broad said. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck wreckage was spotted Saturday in the 400-foot-deep ravine, about 
three miles from the Templin Highway exit off the Golden State Freeway, by U.S. 
Forest Service firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad and a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol, Officer Hector 
Marquez, said investigators who were called in to check the wreckage found a 
.357-caliber handgun believed to have been used in the death of Wetzel, as well 
as a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad also said police wanted to make sure that the remains were not those of 
an innocent victim, killed and placed inside the truck, to aid Snyder in an 
escape. Police had obtained a felony warrant for his arrest after the shooting 
of Wetzel, Broad said, and feared he might flee to the Seattle area. 
</P>
<P>
 But Snyder's sister, Shawn, said Monday she believed the remains were her 
brother's and that he probably drove himself over the side of the road out of 
remorse over the deaths of Wetzel -- who was her boyfriend -- and their father. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure it's him," Shawn Snyder said, adding that no one had seen or heard 
from Snyder since Wetzel's death. She also said a friend who watched TV news 
reports of the truck's discovery told her a recovered jacket matched one worn 
by her brother. 
</P>
<P>
 The fatal shooting on Jan. 14, 1993, occurred in the garage of Stone's house 
as the three young men were repairing a car, Shawn Snyder said. Stone told her 
Wetzel and her brother had been arguing over her, but he wasn't sure why. 
</P>
<P>
 They had never argued before, she said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suicide makes sense, but why he killed Chris doesn't make sense," Shawn 
Snyder said Monday. "Maybe after he did that, in his mind, it was the only 
thing he could do." 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Snyder also maintained that the June 1, 1989, death of her father 
resulted from a SWAT team's use of a battering ram and not from a 
self-inflicted gunshot wound, as police reported at the time. She said the 
family hired its own forensic expert to review autopsy records and that she 
believes her 51-year-old father died when a 300-pound statue was knocked over 
by the battering ram, which destroyed his house. 
</P>
<P>
 Although all four brothers and sisters in the family were upset by the 
incident, Mark Snyder had been especially close to his father and "has been 
emotionally screwed up since that," Shawn Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all the result of somebody who supposedly killed themselves," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 An LAPD spokesman, Officer Rigo Romero, said he could not comment on the cause 
of Gary Snyder's death because the case records were in archives and not 
available on short notice.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: WHEELCHAIR SPORTS CAMP OPENS AT CSUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jade Hogan has a challenging week ahead of her -- she'll receive instruction 
in archery, basketball, badminton, tennis, swimming and track. Plus, the 
12-year-old has to find time to meet up with all her friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, Jade's mother provides her schooling at home because Jade is a 
paraplegic. 
</P>
<P>
 However, once a year, she participates with youngsters like herself in the 
Junior Wheelchair Sports Camp at Cal State Northridge, the only sports camp of 
its kind in Los Angeles. The camp opened Monday and continues through Friday on 
the CSUN campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Marking the ninth year of the wheelchair camp, this year's enrollment boasts 
35 campers, ages 8 to 18, who come from as far south as Compton and as far 
north as Modesto and San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp, sponsored by Cal State Northridge, is funded mostly through private 
grants and donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for the wheelchair camp has dwindled since its inception, said Ingrid 
Cleffi-Hayes, president of Adaptive Sports & Recreation, who spends all year 
trying to raise the money needed to keep the program going.  
</P>
<P>
 The camp previously was sponsored by the Amateur Athletic Foundation and the 
National Wheelchair Tennis Foundation. But now it relies on volunteer help from 
all of its staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Although each child costs $350 to provide instruction, transportation and 
lunch, the camp only charges $150. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a unique camp in that all of the instructors have had some kind of 
disability that they've overcome," said camp coordinator Nick Breit.  
</P>
<P>
 Breit and Cleffi-Hayes are especially excited about their aquatics program, 
which teaches the youngsters to swim. 
</P>
<P>
 Children who attend the sports camp are all at different levels of 
athleticism, according to Breit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these kids really belong here. They are studlings," said Breit. 
"Their upper extremities are really well developed and they're fast."  
</P>
<P>
 However, the philosophy of the summer program promotes that "if they can do a 
couple of the events, it makes the camp worth it," Cleffi-Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen-year old Ted Newman, a first-time camper, said he enjoys the variety 
of sports offered.  
</P>
<P>
 "I like everything," said Ted, who during the regular school year trains with 
the track team at his high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Norm Mitchell, a tennis instructor, said he wants to show the youngsters that 
"the only disability they have is the one they put on themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has found that many of the kids haven't challenged themselves 
because of their parents "who kind of coddle them." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a good time with the kids and they go home to tell their parents, 
'Wow! I can do this," said Bobbie Rohan, a track coach who wants to see his 
campers enjoy themselves, as well as learn a sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's cool!" said 12-year-old Emanuel Lin of the camp. Lin hopes to compete in 
swimming some day and says he likes the camp mostly " 'cause you make new 
friends and see old friends who go to other schools." MAKI BECKERCALIFORNIA

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; RESIDENTS OPPOSE PROPOSED SIGNAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned about the safety of their children, Van Nuys residents have 
petitioned Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude to take action against a 
proposed traffic light they believe would bring hundreds of cars speeding past 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood activist Romana Catton said last week that she is "very, very 
disappointed" with the city Department of Transportation's plans to move ahead 
with a signal at Orion Avenue and Vanowen Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely don't want it," said Catton, who recently presented Braude with 
a petition containing 300 signatures of residents who oppose the light. "We've 
decided that if they go ahead and put that light in, we will protest every 
single day at that intersection with signs and whatever it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, department officials announced that they would pursue plans to 
install the light despite objections from residents living in an area known as 
Midvale-Chisholm Estates, bounded by the San Diego Freeway, Sepulveda 
Boulevard, Sherman Way and Vanowen. After a meeting with Braude about the 
proposed signal last year, Catton said Braude's office told her that he had 
urged the department to withdraw its plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we thought it was a done deal, and now it's come back to haunt us," 
Catton said. "We expect Councilman Braude to stand by his original decision to 
withdraw this signal at Orion and Vanowen." 
</P>
<P>
 Judith Hirshberg, Braude's field deputy, said she was unaware of any promise 
of support made to Catton by the councilman's office. Nor would she say which 
way Braude, who met with department officials last week, was leaning. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was impressed by the presentation by the community," Hirshberg said. "But 
he is waiting to hear back from the DOT on the number of accidents at that 
intersection." 
</P>
<P>
 Department officials, who could not be reached for comment, stated in a letter 
to Braude that the signal is needed to allow apartment residents along Vanowen 
to make left-hand turns. 
</P>
<P>
 But Catton and other residents fear that the lights will make Orion into a 
thoroughfare past their homes and expand the existing shortcut that drivers 
take from Firmament Avenue to the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Commuters use Firmament as a throughway to the on-ramp for the 405 at Sherman 
Way," Catton said. "They speed through here. We fear children may get hurt or 
killed. We've already had some close calls." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 700 vehicles take Firmament to the freeway on-ramp between 4 and 6 
p.m., according to a March, 1993, department study cited by Catton. Residents 
fear that that number will increase to more than 900 with the new signal 
diverting more traffic off Vanowen. JEFF SCHNAUFER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 2 QUAKE-DAMAGED LIBRARIES TO REOPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The days of long treks across the San Fernando Valley in search of an open 
library are coming to an end.  
</P>
<P>
 The West Valley Regional Branch and Van Nuys Branch libraries have announced 
they will reopen Monday after repairing damage caused by the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours for the West Valley library will be noon until 8 p.m. Mondays and 
Wednesdays, and 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Tuesdays and Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Nuys library will be open Mondays and Wednesdays from 12:30 to 8 p.m., 
Tuesdays and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., and Thursdays and Fridays 
from 12:30 to 5:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the two libraries are reopening, three other libraries will end their 
extended schedules instituted after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Encino-Tarzana Branch Library will now be open Mondays and Wednesdays from 
12:30 to 8 p.m., Tuesdays and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., and 
Thursdays and Fridays from 12:30 to 5:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panorama City and Canoga Park Branch Libraries will share the same 
schedule -- Mondays and Tuesdays, 12:30 to 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Thursdays, 
12:30 to 5:30 p.m.; and Fridays and Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS; 24-HOUR REPAIR PROJECT TRYING THEIR PATIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The six mentally retarded adults at the Granada Hills guest home rise again 
and again in the middle of the night with the same complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't sleep because of that noise," they tell care provider Wilma Tamayo. 
</P>
<P>
 That noise is the oh-so-dissonant song of reconstruction, punctuated by the 
incessant thumping of pylons and the chest-rattling roar of earthmovers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the sound of workers hurrying to raise the fallen Simi Valley Freeway, 
toppled by the Northridge earthquake. And it is a sound that closed windows and 
20-foot-high plywood sound walls can't keep out of the 3 L Guest Home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty-four hours (a day)," said neighbor Rodolfo Puno, who lives around the 
corner from where the overpass plunged into the intersection of San Fernando 
Mission Boulevard and Gothic Street in the early hours of Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 As if raising the freeway -- a project due to be completed by late September 
-- weren't concern enough, Caltrans and San Diego-based contractor FCI find 
themselves with an additional task: trying to make the massive undertaking as 
painless as possible for the dozens of nearby residents, many of whom are still 
dealing with quake damage to their own homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be good neighbors," said Caltrans spokeswoman Margie Tiritilli. 
"We have held regular community meetings to try and address the concerns. It's 
just an unfortunate circumstance." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors agree, and most are understanding of the inconveniences and liberal 
in their praise for workers, many of whom are working long hours to get the job 
done on time. But the inconveniences are hard to ignore, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is there the constant and considerable noise, but streets are closed 
off, forcing residents to take longer, alternative routes. There is unending 
truck traffic, the lack of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is the dust. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to keep the windows closed," said Puno as he stood recently under the 
sound wall looming over his back yard. He can't leave his laundry on the line 
for long, he added, without it taking a good dusting. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Baker lives about five houses away from the main construction site and 
said that after a restless night's sleep she often wakes to begin serious house 
cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't seem to get the dust off anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Optometrist Jerome Splan, whose office is about a block away on San Fernando 
Mission Boulevard, keeps dust covers over his medical instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers have erected the enormous plywood walls to guard the nearest homes at 
a cost of $500,000, Tratelli said. A water truck sprays out thousands of 
gallons a day in an attempt to keep the dust down, and then a street sweeper 
comes along to clean up the mess. 
</P>
<P>
 But as concrete rubble is crushed to be reused in the new freeway and tons of 
fill dirt are moved about, some dust is inevitable. And the noise from such an 
operation cannot be muted completely. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans has offered to temporarily move many of the residents nearest the 
reconstruction into hotels or apartments away from the work. Some have taken 
the agency up on the offer, Tiritilli said, with the state paying out about 
$45,000 for 560 hotel room nights so far. 
</P>
<P>
 But most have chosen to stay and make the best of it, they said, washing cars 
more often, sleeping with earplugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have been a lot worse," said neighbor Baker. "At least I wasn't 
under the freeway when it fell . . . and neither was anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Even a tersely worded, handwritten sign asking construction workers to not 
park in front of one house ends with a friendly greeting, and apparent 
appreciation for their grueling hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good night/Good morning," it reads. ERIC SLATER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; EVENING HIGH SCHOOL PROPOSAL SUPPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed evening high school has garnered enough community interest to 
support the project, according to a task force that studied the proposal as a 
way to relieve overcrowding expected to plague Glendale high schools later this 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1997-98 school year, Glendale Unified School District officials expect 
enrollment for grades nine through 12 to exceed the capacity of the district's 
three high schools by 506 students. Enrollment is projected at 8,983 students 
for 1997, with the schools' combined capacity of 8,477. 
</P>
<P>
 School administrators have said they would like to see an evening high school 
in place at one of the district's three high school campuses by fall of 1995.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials foresee 200 to 600 students in grades nine through 12 enrolling in 
night school, all of whom would volunteer to attend classes from 2:15 to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 22-page report scheduled to be presented to the Board of Education 
tonight, the 30-member task force says that an evening high school is cheaper 
than purchasing 15 to 17 portable classrooms to house students at overcrowded 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Evening High School Study Task Force, made up of parents, teachers, 
students, school administrators and community representatives, surveyed parents 
and students to find out if they favored the night school. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force, convened by the Board of Education in March, received 1,901 
responses to the survey, with 1,182 students in grades eight through 10 
answering the questionnaire and 719 parents responding. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the survey results, 26% of the students said they would attend an 
evening high school, while 17% of parents who answered the questionnaire said 
they would be interested in having their children enroll in the school. 
</P>
<P>
 From these results, the task force theorized if 20% of eligible students 
enrolled in evening high school, the school would have 1,740 students -- well 
above the minimum number of 300 to 500 needed to alleviate overcrowding.  
</P>
<P>
 Survey respondents did not express a preference for a specialized area of 
study at an evening high school, but did say they were interested in internship 
and job-placement programs being provided. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force also recommended that the district start a public information 
campaign to publicize the school, hire faculty and a principal and form 
partnerships with local businesses to operate specialized classes. JENNIFER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; OPPONENTS DECRY 'YET ANOTHER MINI-MART' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed carwash and mini-mart at a service station would increase an 
already unbearable traffic circulation problem, nearby residents said at a 
hearing Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply do not need yet another mini-mart for any reason, with all of its 
congestion and problems," said Estheranne Billings, president of the Encino 
Park Improvement Committee, an association of residents who live across Burbank 
Boulevard from the proposed project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Houston-based Shell Oil Co. has proposed to add 311 square feet to its 
existing buildings -- currently 1,008 square feet -- to accommodate the carwash 
and mini-mart. The proposed project area is on the southeast corner of Burbank 
Boulevard and White Oak Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Green, associate zoning administrator, delayed making a decision 
Monday, saying he needs to verify points brought up by both Shell Oil and 
opponents of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 But he noted that, a few years earlier, a zoning administrator approved the 
oil company's request to build a larger food mart than the one currently 
proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If one of my colleagues approved a 1,000-square-foot convenience store 
before, I would be hard-pressed to explain why I turned down a 609-square-foot 
mini-mart," Green said.  
</P>
<P>
 The food mart would be constructed in an existing service building, which 
would be enlarged to accommodate the market and the carwash. 
</P>
<P>
 Green agreed with Shell Oil officials about the traffic situation, saying the 
congestion was largely caused by other businesses in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Adjacent or nearby stores include a specialty foods store, a liquor store and 
a dry-cleaning business. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are being accused of causing a parking problem, although they are going 
to triple their parking," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added, however, that the Los Angeles Department of Transportation estimated 
that the proposed expansion would increase by 250 to 1,550 the number of daily 
trips generated by the service station. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell was required to go through the hearing process because it wants to 
increase the square footage of its buildings by 20% more than allowed under 
current zoning laws. KAY HWANGBO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WESTLAKE VILLAGE; DOLE FOOD CO. PLANS CORPORATE COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dole Food Co. plans to build a 525,000-square-foot corporate headquarters in 
Westlake Village by the end of 1995, a project hailed by city officials as a 
welcome addition to the city's growing business center. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the $88-million business complex at Lindero Canyon Road west 
of Valley Oaks Memorial Park is expected to begin later this summer, with the 
first three buildings scheduled for completion by December, 1995, said Westlake 
Village Planning Director Bob Theobald. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved development agreements for the project earlier this 
month, with no public comment on the plan, Theobald said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a first-rate plan," Theobald said. "I think it will improve the 
entire quality of the business park on that side of the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of the project will be outdoor garden areas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole moved to Westlake Village from Florida in 1991, and has been leasing 
office space for about 1,000 employees, who will occupy the new corporate 
headquarters, said Tom Pernice, vice president of public affairs for the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came for the quality of life, among other things," Pernice said. "It's a 
great, well-thought-out community with good services and an excellent work 
force to draw from." 
</P>
<P>
 The construction project is the largest approved in Westlake Village in the 
last five years, Theobald said.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the 130-acre Westlake North business center on the 
other side of Lindero Canyon Road in 1989, but construction of that project has 
been on hold. KURT PITZER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; CHEVY CHASE LIBRARY TO REOPEN WEDNESDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After being closed for five months because of damage sustained in the 
Northridge earthquake, the Chevy Chase Branch Library will reopen Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake caused the ceiling in the 20-year-old facility to 
collapse, showering the library's 30,000-book collection and employees' desks 
with ceiling tile fragments. 
</P>
<P>
 Many more tiles fell during the myriad of aftershocks, making the facility 
unsafe for employees and the public, said John Hickman, facilities services 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 The long delay between the earthquake and this week's reopening is due to the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency's decision to only reimburse the city for 
$12,000 of the $29,000 required to fix the ceiling, Hickman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have appealed the request, asking FEMA for the entire amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, workers have removed the remaining ceiling tiles, making the branch 
look somewhat like "one of those New Age restaurants on Melrose," said Chevy 
Chase Branch Manager Mary Alice Wollam. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have sent a city bookmobile to sit in front of the branch on 
Wednesdays to serve residents in Chevy Chase Canyon who were unable to use the 
branch facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chevy Chase Library was the only city facility closed for a long period of 
time following the 6.8-magnitude earthquake. Several of the city's six library 
facilities were closed for several days after the earthquake so employees could 
pick up books that fell during the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of budget cutbacks, the Chevy Chase branch will be open to the public 
only on Wednesdays from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. and on Saturdays from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.

L.A. PREPARES BID FOR FEDERAL POVERTY FUNDS; AID: THE CITY'S APPLICATION FOR 
'EMPOWERMENT' STATUS, DUE TO HUD BY JUNE 30, AWAITS COUNCIL APPROVAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An application to establish an "empowerment zone" that would provide federal 
aid to poverty-stricken communities from Pacoima to Watts was approved Monday 
by two committees of the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The voluminous application approved by a joint meeting of the council's 
Economic Development Committee and Housing and Redevelopment Committee is 
scheduled for final council action Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The application is due to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 
by June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of last-minute snags, city officials drafting the application have 
been scrambling to meet the fast-approaching deadline. But they said they 
expect to submit the application in time. 
</P>
<P>
 "These (snags) will probably be worked out by tomorrow," Marilyn Lurie, a 
director in the city's Community Development Department, said after the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 If HUD officials approve the application in September, the communities within 
the empowerment zones would share $100 million in special aid and federal tax 
breaks.  
</P>
<P>
 Empowerment zones are the centerpiece of President Clinton's urban 
revitalization program. Only six zones will be approved nationwide, and each 
will be limited to a 20-square-mile area with no more than 20,000 residents. In 
addition to the empowerment zones, the program establishes 65 smaller 
"enterprise communities," each receiving $3 million in funds for social 
services programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is proposing four enterprise communities, covering an area centered 
in south Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the problems faced by city officials drafting the application, Lurie 
said, is that the federal government requires specific details on how the 
federal money would be spent to reduce unemployment, blight and poverty. She 
said officials had until recently believed they needed only to provide general 
ideas on how the money would be spent. 
</P>
<P>
 She said they have been working to provide those details. 
</P>
<P>
 The other problem has been that the state government wants the city to give it 
2% to 5% of the funding if the application is approved, to reimburse the state 
for the costs of processing the federal money and passing it on to local 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Lurie said the city doesn't want to pay the "administrative fee" and has been 
told by HUD officials that the application may not be as competitive against 
proposals from other cities if the state diverts some of the funding.

MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO SEX CRIMES AGAINST YOUNG WOMEN, 10-YEAR-OLD; COURTS: 
DEFENSE ATTORNEY SAYS CLIENT, SON OF A BEVERLY HILLS POLICE OFFICER, WAS 
MISIDENTIFIED BY ALLEGED VICTIMS.

<P>
 A Woodland Hills man pleaded not guilty Monday in Van Nuys Municipal Court to 
charges he abducted and raped or sexually assaulted three young women and a 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard August Davis, the 29-year-old son of a Beverly Hills police officer, 
kept his head bowed as he pleaded not guilty to 37 felonies, including 
kidnaping for sexual purposes, rape, sodomy and child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Peter L. Knecht said he would challenge identifications that 
three of the four alleged victims -- ages 10 to 18 -- made of his client. They 
chose Davis' likeness from a set of photos known in law enforcement circles as 
a "six pack." 
</P>
<P>
 But Knecht said his client's photograph "stood out larger and angrier and 
meaner than anyone else's," which, he said, may have influenced the victims to 
select it. 
</P>
<P>
 The child and young women were grabbed from West Valley streets by a man 
asking directions and taken in a pickup truck to isolated alleyways or mountain 
locations, where they were beaten and sexually assaulted. The young women were 
abducted at knifepoint, while the child was threatened with a stun gun, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The abductions and assaults occurred between May 1 and May 30, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Martin L. Herscovitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Peter L. Knecht, a former prosecutor in Beverly Hills, said 
he'd often worked with Davis' father and that the family was devastated by the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a helpful kid. The whole neighborhood is shocked," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who Knecht described as "a very good salesman," will return to court 
July 21, when Judge Leland B. Harris will schedule a preliminary hearing. Davis 
is being held in lieu of $2-million bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Knecht said Davis asserts he is innocent. Davis, who had no prior criminal 
record, was arrested June 3 near the intersection of Ventura Boulevard and Sale 
Avenue, two days after investigators linked a string of sexual attacks to a 
single, serial rapist.

TUESDAY SPECIAL; VALLEY INTERVIEW; FORGIVENESS CALLED CRUCIAL TO MAINTAINING 
7-MONTH GANG TRUCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A truce between Latino gangs in the San Fernando Valley has been in effect for 
more than seven months. There have been episodes of violence during that time, 
but they have resulted in no deaths of gang members, according to truce 
organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 The treaty was arranged by two volunteers, William (Blinky) Rodriguez, 
co-owner of the Jet Center gym in Van Nuys, and Donald Garcia, who spent more 
than half his life in prison before turning his life around seven years ago. 
Later, they were joined by a third man, Steve Martinez, whose dramatic refusal 
to seek vengeance on gang members who shot him only two days before the first 
peace treaty organizing meeting -- he still wore his hospital bandages -- 
provided a concrete example of forgiveness at a time when the gangs wondered 
how a treaty could possibly work. 
</P>
<P>
 Each Sunday the three meet with representatives of gangs to mediate 
misunderstandings between them that could lead to violence. As the three men 
sat down a few days ago to speak with staff writer John Johnson about the 
treaty, they were struggling to prevent retaliation by Latino gangs over the 
accidental killing June 11 of a Latino woman caught in a cross-fire between 
what police said were black gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What is the state of the truce?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: (Rodriguez) We're at seven months and 13 days without a killing or 
gang-related homicide. We're at a place where we've put an enormous amount of 
extra time into it. There have been some altercations, some different incidents 
between the neighborhoods. But no one's really retaliated. Before, what would 
constitute a killing was just the idea of killing someone. Now there's been 
some things happening where someone could have died but didn't. So we've just 
been really shoring up the foundation and doing whatever we've got to do to 
keep communication lines between the neighborhoods together. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What led all of you to get involved?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Garcia) For a while, Blinky and myself -- this is before Steve got 
involved -- we had like a burden in our neighborhoods for the violence that was 
happening within the barrios. We just fell into this by what I believe was an 
act of God. Why we're involved is because we have this burden. We were raised 
in the Valley. We see the change. It's not like it used to be. The barrio used 
to protect a barrio. Now you've got little gangs within the barrio, and they're 
fighting among themselves. And that's what we're trying to prevent. My reward 
is seeing that the mothers aren't crying and the babies, meaning the gang 
members, aren't dying. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has it taken a toll on you all?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Martinez) Yeah, it has. We're very tired and weary. There's times where 
one person is not feeling that strength that day, so the next person will take 
that place. If I'm too tired or not able to deal with a situation, one of them 
will go. It's been a lot of work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you making changes in the gang members? Can they see how things are 
better with the truce?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Rodriguez) Each and every gang member in this Valley has benefited, just 
in the fact that they're not living in a constant fear all the time. Before, if 
a car drove by, you'd hide under a car or duck out of the way. Now there's more 
confidence that they can walk down the street -- which seems the most basic 
thing that an individual in our society can do, take a walk down the street 
without feeling any kind of a fear or pressure. I feel also that these 
individuals have learned more about themselves. They've learned to humble 
themselves a little. They've learned to swallow false pride. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is this a religiously centered effort?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Garcia) Let me answer that. I believe that if it wasn't for God, this 
peace would not be happening. Because the frustrations we go through, if it 
wasn't for the Lord giving us the wisdom and the strength, I know for a fact 
that it wouldn't work. Because there's times when I want to erupt, but because 
the Lord is in control of my life and I'm focused on him I get control of my 
emotions and my thinking and my feelings. For example, Steve wasn't serving the 
Lord. He was just a gang member. And after he was around us, all of a sudden 
the Lord got ahold of his life and he's now one of our members at the head of 
the table. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Steve, would you mind telling about that meeting where you stood up and 
forgave, because it seems that was really important in getting the truce off on 
the right foot?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Martinez) When I saw they were trying to do a peace treaty that would help 
everybody, I knew for it to work that I had to forgive. Those guys who shot me 
couldn't wonder if I was going to be holding a grudge against them. In my 
heart, I believe that if I held a grudge I wouldn't be able to do the kind of 
work that I'm doing now. I did get shot two days before the peace treaty. The 
guys (who did it) were there. It was a big surprise. I was very angry at first. 
I felt very disrespected by the fact of them being there. But for the sake of 
the peace treaty, I said I would hold back and stop anybody from trying to get 
pay-back for what happened to me. To make the peace work, that's where it all 
started, by forgetting the past. It was only two days afterward and I had 
bandages on me and everything. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Was that a hard thing to do, to get up and say that?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Martinez) Yes, yes, it was. A lot of emotion. Afterward, they shook my 
hand and they told me, "We respect you for what you did." It really hit them 
hard. We talk to each other real good now. They call me a lot. They use me to 
consult a lot of the situations they get into. 
</P>
<P>
 (Rodriguez) The power is the forgiveness. I had to also forgive the people who 
killed my son (four years ago in a drive-by attack). That is the way of God. 
But by today's standards, to a lot of people, it becomes a weak hustle. We've 
been very sensitive, so that you don't misconstrue what's going on. We've been 
very careful of the way we have shared the reflection of the love of God 
through our lives. We don't sit in these meetings and Bible-thump people over 
the head. We'll normally open it up, Donald will say a prayer or read a little 
portion of Scripture. He'll break down the Scripture, what it meant in simpler 
terms. And then we get on with issues and agendas and arbitrations and whatever 
it takes. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been a few that have said, "I don't know about this turning the 
other cheek stuff." We say, "We don't ask anything from anybody, except that 
you respect us for who we are." This last Sunday when Donald said the prayer I 
saw a lot of hats coming off. Even though when that prayer's over they're back 
to their old stinking thinking, the bottom line is they're giving us the 
respect at that time and place. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't judge us by what we say, judge us by what we do. By the fruits we're 
producing. Right now we've produced seven and a half months without a killing, 
which is unprecedented, which is historical in this Valley. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 We might as well be private investigators. We've got to go out, find out 
exactly what happened. First of all, they have the respect to call us. Then we 
respond, because sometimes you can't wait until tomorrow. It's got to be right 
now, because right now there could be a killing. We respond, we track down the 
guys that blew it. We find out what happened. Then we'll go looking for the 
other people. It takes one day, two days, three days. We track them down, we 
bring them together. 
</P>
<P>
 (Garcia) And they call us so they won't retaliate. We see them negotiating, 
coming to agreements. I don't know if they realize it, but they are swallowing 
their pride a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What has to happen next to keep this going and make it last?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Rodriguez) There has to be structure. That's something that we're slowly 
moving into. The Jet Center is going to be the Valley outlet for Cities in 
Schools, a national dropout prevention program. There's funding out there. And 
there's going to come a time and place where we'll have to go into strategic 
planning and structure. 
</P>
<P>
 But at this point in time the main concern has been solidifying and putting 
out fires, because it is summertime. Summertime is when all the problems kick 
out, where they triple. We were hoping to have a summer baseball team, 
something to provide for these guys to vent. I would like to see them attend a 
Bible study. 
</P>
<P>
 We have dialogue with the LAPD. We recognize they're a part of it. We've gone 
through this attitude of, "What are they about? Are they no good or are they 
sincere?" It hasn't been like anyone running to embrace what we're doing. 
Because we're dealing with a part of society that's an eyesore. Most people 
say, "Lock them up and throw the key away, they're irredeemable." 
</P>
<P>
 We've found people that are very redeemable and very salvageable. We haven't 
come in with data, we haven't come in with documentation, we haven't come in 
with a blueprint. We just jumped into the water and started swimming. A lot of 
people thought this thing will never last -- "they can't keep this thing 
going." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has the attitude of police turned around?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Rodriguez) I got a call from (Deputy Chief Martin H.) Pomeroy. He called 
me because of the incident that has happened recently on the street (the woman 
caught in the cross fire). To come from the top guy in the Valley, they've got 
confidence in us. 
</P>
<P>
 (Garcia) My past wasn't a very successful or loving adventure. The first time 
I talked to police officers was at a handball tournament. They saw the change 
in my life. I would even tell them, "We thank you for being here." We need the 
police just as much as they need us. Now I believe they've got a better 
understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 (Rodriguez) We wish they would realize what we have now is a very special 
thing. I hear from different guys, "Yeah, right, the peace treaty. It will fall 
apart." Which reminds me of some of the gang members that are negative about 
the peace treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 (Garcia) You've got them on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Regarding the future, what should be done next?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Rodriguez) We need to be able to mobilize with more of ourselves. Donald 
has a full-time job, Steve has a full-time job. I own my own business. We would 
like to be out there much more, solidifying and recruiting guys that have good 
brains, good sense. 
</P>
<P>
 I recognize there's a lot of agencies in this Valley. Especially now, when the 
No. 1 agenda in the nation is gangs, there's a lot of agencies out there that 
would like to help us but just haven't. They haven't come and said, "Here's 
some unencumbered dollars." They wonder, "Whoa, wait a minute, what are you 
going to do with these dollars? You expect us to give you some money with no 
proposal?" In other words, red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 My worst nightmare is we lose a grip of the handle and then this Valley 
recognizes what we had. No one in this Valley has been able to do this before. 
Here we are, willing vessels. But we also have needs. We are looking for help. 
There's agencies now that are turning their protocol toward gangs because where 
the federal funds are going is toward gangs. Without getting too political, the 
situation is that they know how to milk the system, but we can get it done. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you saying unless you get some resources you won't be able to continue 
this?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Rodriguez) I'm not saying that. We will go with everything we've got, 
regardless. But we can be more efficient, more effective. We can really pull 
something together for the San Fernando Valley that has a sense of direction. 
We do need help, though. We're not trying to be the Lone Rangers, because this 
job is too big. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How big a demand has it made on your families?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Rodriguez) I've been called out at 3:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 (Linda Garcia, Donald's wife) When I receive those calls, it doesn't upset me. 
It makes me want to give Donald the phone. When I received that call four years 
ago and Blinky was telling me his son was killed, that was the most devastating 
phone call I ever received. I will never, ever turn anyone away. 
</P>
<P>
 (Garcia) We can't thank the gang members enough for participating. They're the 
big part of the solution. 
</P>
<P>
 (Rodriguez) The homicide detective is sleeping at night.

METRO FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; STUDENT ADVISERS GET VOTE ON SCHOOL BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Conejo Valley school board will soon have a new voting member. 
</P>
<P>
 According to district officials, student advisers to the elected five-member 
board have earned the right to cast votes on all public matters.The votes will 
become part of the official record but carry no weight in the official votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, elected student representatives must be allowed to cast 
non-binding, advisory votes if at least 500 students sign a petition backing 
the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Thousand Oaks High School student Michelle Quist presented 
district officials with a petition carrying the required number of signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees of the Conejo Valley Unified School District will discuss tonight the 
guidelines that will be used to choose the voting student advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, student advisers from each of the district's four high schools 
gave brief reports on campus activities at the beginning of each meeting, but 
they did not participate in policy discussions or cast votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Mildred Lynch expressed concern Monday that the students would 
lack a thorough understanding of district issues before casting their votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They won't have the background for it," she said. "Most of what we do is not 
just paper there at the board meeting. It's what's gone on before. Everything 
has history."

MAN HELD IN SHOOTING DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four hours after allegedly shooting a man, Teodoro Sanchez Huerta was arrested 
when he returned to his Hi Vista home, the scene of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Joaquin F. Bonilla, 43, also of Hi Vista, was shot several times 
in his upper body Sunday afternoon while standing in Huerta's front yard, 
Sheriff's Deputy Fidel Gonzales said.Bonilla died at the scene, and Huerta, 35, 
fled in a pickup truck, Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men, who were acquaintances, were arguing before the shooting, said 
homicide Sgt. Lynn Reeder. "As far as the real motive behind the argument, 
that's being investigated," Reeder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide detectives and sheriff's deputies were investigating the incident in 
this remote, unincorporated area Sunday evening when Huerta returned to his 
home. He was arrested on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Huerta was being held Monday without bail at the Antelope Valley Sheriff's 
Station and is expected to be arraigned today. Investigators recovered the 
rifle believed to have been used in the shooting, Reeder said. SHARON MOESER

SIDEWALKS TO BE ADDED IN EAST NEWHALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 East Newhall will receive a $650,000 make-over later this year in the form of 
new sidewalks and repaved alleyways. 
</P>
<P>
 The work is expected to improve drainage conditions and pedestrian safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have long asked for sidewalks in the area. A candidate for City 
Council in April made the sidewalks an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Bird said that funds have been long been available to the city for 
infrastructure improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been getting grant funds for years," he said. "The county, 
preceding that, was getting funds. For some odd reasons, very little of that 
money has filtered into infrastructure improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going on three and a half years and we're still waiting for work to be 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are paying for the improvements with federal Community 
Development Block Grant money set aside to help low- and moderate-income 
residents through construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita is using about $260,000 in block grant funds awarded this year 
and the remaining $390,000 from similar funds unspent over the past two years 
for the Newhall project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really excited about this," said Vyto Adomaitis, manager of the grant 
program. "It's nice to get something done that will really bring some changes 
and improvements to the area." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is expected to authorize seeking construction bids for the 
project July 12. Groundbreaking is tentatively set for September, with work to 
be completed by January, 1995.

22,330 HOMES BEING PLANNED FOR NEWHALL RANCH DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Newhall Land and Farming Co. on Monday unveiled plans for a 19-square-mile 
community west of Six Flags Magic Mountain, which would put 70,000 residents on 
what is now farmland. 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed, the new community of Newhall Ranch would include 22,330 homes to 
be constructed over a 25-year period. There would be five residential villages, 
each with a small shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the plans are a 200-acre business park, a 215-acre golf course, 172 
cumulative acres of parkland and sites for eight elementary schools, a high 
school and a junior high school. Space for a Metrolink commuter rail line, a 
network of trails and two sites for fire stations have also been set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall Ranch would be about the same size as the Newhall Land Co.'s existing 
community, Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Valencia is reaching the point where we can see build-out on the horizon," 
said Gloria Glenn, a Newhall Land senior vice president. "If you look at 
demographic projections, by everyone who does demographic projections, L. A. 
County is going to continue to grow." 
</P>
<P>
 But area environmental groups, which have clashed with Newhall Land in the 
past, did not warmly greet the announcement of the company's new project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's leapfrog development," said Lynne Plambeck, vice president of 
the Santa Clarita Organization for Planning the Environment. "They haven't 
built out the Santa Clarita Valley yet and they're starting in another area." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita's chapter of the Sierra Club is concerned Newhall Ranch 
encroaches upon two county-designated Significant Ecological Areas -- the Santa 
Clara River and the edge of the Santa Susana Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their idea of being environmentally sensitive is not everyone else's idea of 
being environmentally sensitive," said Pat Saletore, chairwoman of Santa 
Clarita group. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall Land officials say the project offers an array of housing and fits 
nicely with the nearby rural area, noting its plans to designate more than 
5,400 acres of open space. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are committed to creating a social community that provides the human 
services and an environmental setting for an enjoyable place to raise a family, 
live and work," said Jim Harter, senior vice president of community 
development. "The preservation of the river, high country, oak savannas, 
wildlife corridors, bluffs and canyons -- representing over 45% of the property 
-- truly make Newhall Ranch a community by nature." 
</P>
<P>
 One point both the developer and environmentalists agree upon is that the 
project has a long way to go before it is adopted by Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a final plan by any means," said Harter. "This is just the 
beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall Land officials hope to submit environmental documents to Los Angeles 
County by the end of the year and have the project up for review by the Board 
of Supervisors in the fall of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The company wants to begin construction on Newhall Ranch by 1998.

POLICE SEEKING IDENTITY OF BODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Law enforcement authorities unable to identify a woman's body found last week 
along a winding, two-lane road here have released a composite sketch of the 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman is described as Hispanic, in her 20s, 5 feet 8 inches tall and 165 
pounds, with brown eyes and curly, shoulder-length hair apparently dyed auburn, 
according to Sheriff's Deputy Larry Mead.She was found wearing a light green, 
short-sleeve knit shirt and blue jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 A passing motorist discovered the body shortly after 4 a.m. June 14 along 
Ridge Route Road in a rural area about 5 1/2 miles north of Lake Hughes Road.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; NEVER ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL; TIRELESS 
ROTHENBERG CHARTS THE FUTURE OF U.S. SOCCER

 Two-thirty in the morning. The responsibility nudges Alan Rothenberg awake, 
tugs him out of bed and across a hardwood floor, drops him into a leather chair 
at a cluttered desk. 
</P>
<P>
 He reaches for the phone. He dials his secretary at the office. Her voice mail 
answers. He dictates. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next 90 minutes he makes decisions for others who are sleeping, who 
will hear about them six hours later and have no idea they were issued by a man 
in his nightclothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the responsibility leads him other places. One recent night his 
wife, Georgina, investigated an ominous squeaking and discovered her husband 
riding his stationary bike. The digital clock read 3:27 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm lying in bed and a million things go through my mind," Rothenberg says. 
</P>
<P>
 Each one capable of staining the world's largest sporting event and the Los 
Angeles entertainment lawyer who has dared to run it. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the responsibility that will not let Rothenberg rest, this World Cup 
soccer tournament he is trying to sell to a country that doesn't know soccer 
from kickball. 
</P>
<P>
 By July 18, as chief executive officer of World Cup USA 94, Inc., Rothenberg 
will have supervised 52 soccer games at nine U.S. sites. 
</P>
<P>
 He will attempt to do it calmly, despite international passion that can turn 
tailgate parties into riots. 
</P>
<P>
 He will attempt to do it confidently, despite many in the soccer Establishment 
who privately hope he trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Underneath the monogrammed shirts and silk suits, Rothenberg, 55, looks like a 
boxer. His voice is like sandpaper, his eyes still and cold. His thick hands 
move with his words. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't unnerve him," former law partner Ronald Silverman said. "You can't 
scare him." 
</P>
<P>
 But this, Rothenberg concedes, is different. 
</P>
<P>
 If he succeeds, he will be able to look in a mirror and see the reincarnation 
of Peter Ueberroth, who was making a runaway success of the '84 Olympics while 
Rothenberg was serving as the Los Angeles Games' commissioner of soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone forever will be those back-room days as president of the Clippers, owner 
of the Los Angeles Aztecs pro soccer team, lawyer for Jack Kent Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
 But if he fails, soccer as a spectator sport in this country fails with him. 
Gone forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get so intense on the inside," Rothenberg said. "But you have to stay 
calm on the outside. You can never let them see you panic." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his fears have become successes: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ninety-five percent of World Cup tickets have been sold, although there 
were distribution problems. Rothenberg says they were minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- More than $250 million has been collected in fees from major corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- By the time the final is played July 17 at the Rose Bowl before an 
estimated worldwide TV audience of 2 billion, Rothenberg said, the World Cup is 
expected to have netted $20 million for the advancement of soccer in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, the checking account of the U.S. Soccer Federation had a 
balance of $900. 
</P>
<P>
 Other fears, though, have manifested themselves into enough enemies to fill a 
120-yard field. 
</P>
<P>
 In his attempt to establish a legacy for both soccer and himself, Rothenberg 
has offended many of those he is trying to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Charging him with everything from conflicts of interest to schoolyard 
bullying, many in soccer's Establishment have decided his price for success is 
too high. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man has the morals of a bandit," soccer entrepreneur Michael Hogue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg hears the charges and laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joining the U.S. Soccer Federation was like joining the PTA," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who have worked closely with Rothenberg, even some who resigned 
to escape his combative reign as USSF President and World Cup boss, also scoff 
at his opponents' credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The failings of the accusers, some say, represent the reason soccer needed 
Rothenberg in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are going to say bad things about Alan Rothenberg," said Charles 
Kenny, a former World Cup executive. "Others are going to say good things. But 
you can't have an event of his magnitude without a man like him." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is agent Leigh Steinberg, who, even though he represents the U.S. 
team in sometimes tense negotiations with the USSF, says he has walked away 
from Rothenberg with one overwhelming feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the best thing to ever happen to U.S. soccer," Steinberg said. "I 
understand what is being said about him, but you have to look at what has 
happened to soccer in this country before he was in charge . . . then what has 
happened since." 
</P>

<P>
 Eleven at night, a lower middle-class section of Detroit, a pharmacy known as 
Eddie's Drugs, 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Rothenberg is the father. Alan is the 15-year-old son who spends a lot 
of time selling gum and sweeping floors. 
</P>
<P>
 While walking out the back after closing, Alan sees a gun. In seconds, he and 
two others are back inside, on their knees, three gunmen standing above them 
counting money and swinging pistols. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kneeling there with my eyes closed, I heard a thunk and a groan, a thunk and 
a groan," Rothenberg recalled. "I was third in line. I'm thinking, 'God, what's 
going to happen?' " 
</P>
<P>
 He had sort of the same feeling in 1990, when he was elected president of the 
USSF and given one mission: make the World Cup work. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been awarded to the United States in 1988 but there were no marketing 
partners, no interest, and a good chance that soccer's world governing body, 
FIFA, would move it to another country. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg, despite having played in only two soccer games in his life, did 
not wait to be the next one knocked in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Before soccer's car-wash and bake-sale crowd could blink, he had fired 
everyone from World Cup CEOs to secretaries, changed everything from marketing 
plans to salary structures, and basically appointed himself soccer king. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these people had to realize, there is a big difference between lining 
the field for a youth-league game and running a potentially billion-dollar 
business," Rothenberg said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 And those gunmen 40 years ago? Rothenberg laughs about them, too. 
</P>
<P>
 They left a scar on the back of his head with the butt of a gun. But several 
weeks later he spotted their pictures in a newspaper -- he said he had been so 
frightened he would never forget those faces -- and they were soon in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg learned then that there was nothing wrong with a little fear. As 
long as you know how to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ron Newman, coach of the San Diego Sockers professional team: "Everybody 
says this guy is using soccer to promote his own interests. . . . I say, 'Hey, 
we're also using him . ' This guy has his whole career on the line. He cannot 
afford to fail." 
</P>
<P>
 But some have decided it's not a fair trade. 
</P>
<P>
 They say he is working not for soccer's fortunes, for which he had little 
concern four years ago, but for his own fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the things he has done are . . . morally wrong," said Louis Palivos, 
president of the Illinois State Soccer Federation and a candidate in the coming 
USSF presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the things that have many upset: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The six-figure salaries and about $15 million in bonuses and severance pay 
that top executives of nonprofit World Cup USA 94, Inc., are receiving. 
</P>
<P>
 This includes an anticipated $3-million bonus for Rothenberg for his 
"volunteer" efforts. Rothenberg has already taken out a $300,000 loan against 
that bonus, according to World Cup Board members. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rothenberg not only is taking over World Cup USA 94, but also a proposed 
new major soccer league, even though he was elected president of only one 
organization, the USSF. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An attempt by Rothenberg to bill World Cup for his hours in the name of his 
law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg says that his firm of Latham & Watkins was never paid for his time 
spent on World Cup business, but sources have told The Times that on one 
occasion he tried to bill World Cup for time spent on television negotiations 
and was rebuffed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rothenberg's standard practice of flying first class and staying in suites. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is still a charity . . . and I just don't think anyone should fly first 
class in a charity," said Richard Groff, USSF treasurer who is also running 
against Rothenberg in the August elections. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Two in the afternoon. Rummaging through that day's mail, oil salesman Allen 
Gilmore has discovered a surprise check for $4,300 from the M&M/Mars company. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmore, the president of the state soccer federation in Wyoming, earlier had 
received a check of $5,000 from Adidas. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time, he said, that "people in the U.S. Soccer Federation didn't 
even know Wyoming existed." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, because of sponsorship deals nurtured by Rothenberg, Gilmore is able to 
offer college scholarships to his state's junior soccer players for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alan has turned everything around," Gilmore said. "If he wants to run 
everything involved with soccer in this country -- and keep bringing in money 
-- I'd be tickled to death." 
</P>
<P>
 Not every Rothenberg story, though, has such a happy ending. Ask Hogue, a 
Torrance businessman who produces soccer games and is the agent for U.S. player 
Hugo Perez. 
</P>
<P>
 Unhappy with the state of soccer here, Hogue and brother Skip raised $49,000 
and spent nine months organizing a campaign to elect an unknown outsider as 
USSF president in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The outsider was Rothenberg, whom Hogue and others claim promised to make him 
the U.S. team's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, after Hogue had helped build the training facility in Mission Viejo, he 
says he was promised an opportunity to run it. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Hogue is weighing a lawsuit against Rothenberg, who he says reneged on 
both promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alan Rothenberg's word means nothing," Hogue said. "His regard for the truth 
is a joke." 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg said he never promised Hogue anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can deal with a lot of images . . . but (Hogue) just never worked out," 
Rothenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 As varied as Casper, Wyo., and Torrance, the paradoxes of Rothenberg's last 
four years cling to him like annoying lint. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind his back, some of the World Cup's 400 paid employees call him 
"Rothenweiler." 
</P>
<P>
 But this is the same man who once hired a helicopter to transport him from a 
World Cup function to a nephew's bar mitzvah because he didn't want to 
disappoint the youngster. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the same man whose wife gets teary-eyed when she talks about a 34-year 
marriage that has survived the pressures of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the Rothenberg who, upon firing Charles Cale as World Cup CEO at 
the end of 1991, failed to offer Cale's secretary another position, contrary to 
most standard business practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophia Alvarado, one of the first two World Cup employees in Los Angeles, 
needed six months after her severance pay ran out to find a full-time job to 
help support her two children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuck was fired and they gave me no options," she said. "Alan never even 
spoke to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rothenberg: "I don't beat up people because I enjoy beating up people . . 
. but if I have to leave some strewn bodies in order to win, within the rules, 
that's the way you have to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eight at night, an Orlando hotel, the USSF general meeting in August of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 While Rothenberg sits at a dinner on the night before his election as USSF 
president, his campaign workers are up to dirty tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 In a story corroborated by several others, Los Angeles businessman Paul 
Hinkley said workers used tweezers to remove clippings of a damaging newspaper 
story about Rothenberg that had been slipped under hundreds of hotel doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinkley, who said he also spied on the opposition for Rothenberg, is another 
who claims World Cup organizers failed to find him a full-time job, as 
promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg, who denies any knowledge of dirty tricks, admittedly wouldn't have 
even run for office except for the influence offered by FIFA, soccer's powerful 
governing body. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never would have gone for that office if its wasn't for the World Cup," 
Rothenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 With attitudes like these, he was immediately mistrusted by many of the 3.5 
million mostly working-class soccer volunteers he represented. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the sort of people he grew up with, but left. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg spent his first 21 years near downtown Detroit, in a modest 
three-bedroom home that housed seven people, including a grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Bebe, pushed him to expand his mind beyond the family-owned 
pharmacy. His father quietly pulled at him to remain close to his roots. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from the University of Michigan law school with top honors, 
he listened to his mother and headed for California. 
</P>
<P>
 When he and Georgina drove off, his father turned his head so his son wouldn't 
see him cry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Detroit seemed a little confining," Rothenberg said. "If you were from the 
right family, or from the right background, you would get certain breaks. If 
you're not, you don't -- and we weren't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a nobody in Detroit." 
</P>
<P>
 The soccer community says he runs the World Cup as if he has forgotten those 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
 They point to the time that, while pushing the proposed Major League Soccer, 
Rothenberg flew to Oregon to meet with the renowned Nike CEO, Phillip Knight. 
Nike sources say Rothenberg did not have an appointment and that Knight was 
scheduled to be in Europe then. 
</P>
<P>
 When a receptionist refused to admit him, Rothenberg said that as the leader 
of the World Cup, he was not leaving until Knight recognized his presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight, who coincidentally had canceled his trip and was in his office, 
finally met with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Staffers also twitter about a memo from Rothenberg urging everyone to help him 
rise on the Sporting News' annual list of the 100 most powerful people in 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991 he was ranked 86th. Last year, he was unranked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't care if that (publication) thinks I'm a jerk, this was not about me, 
but about my position," Rothenberg said. "I was pushing our people to get 
Sporting News to recognize the World Cup's impact in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Said former partner Silverman, "Other tough guys can deliver their tough 
messages with a little more subtlety." 
</P>
<P>
 This includes his approach to salaries. Although Rothenberg turned down an 
offer from his board of directors to pay him $300,000 a year, the salary of his 
top assistant has rankled many. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott LeTellier, the No. 2 person at World Cup, is making $210,000 in salary 
this year with a bonus package that includes a $40,000 allowance for 
country-club dues and a $1,225 monthly car allowance. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, LeTellier will be paid for nine months after the completion of 
the World Cup, and will also be paid moving expenses to any of the 48 
contiguous states for up to 18 months after the event. Included in that moving 
package are 12 round-trip tickets anywhere on the U.S. mainland, with a promise 
of payment for first-class upgrade coupons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the USSF is a charity, and as a charity, our priority must be 
developing the program," said Groff, the USSF treasurer. "Too often, we are 
developing perks." 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg, whose current estimates of a $20-million profit are 20% less than 
his quoted estimates in published reports last year, defends the salaries and 
perks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are working with a $400-million budget, and we are only paying market 
value -- less in some cases -- for some of the people we have to have," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, Rothenberg continues to work 20-hour days while defending his 
reputation as a man who gets things done. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a back condition that sometimes causes him such pain that he lies down 
in airports. Yet he was recently strong enough to open the doors of the White 
House, where he became the first U.S. soccer official in recent memory to have 
a personal meeting with the President. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do care what people think about me, care about the community, care about 
what is left behind," he said. "But ultimately, I've got a job to do." 
</P>
<P>
 And ultimately, that job is soccer. Rothenberg laughs when recalling his two 
encounters on the field, both with employees during the 1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first game, he said, he stood outside the penalty area in front of his 
own team's goal and played the thug. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them I would stand out there and knock people down, and that's what I 
did," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second game, he moved up to forward, ran in front of a crossing pass, 
and had no idea what to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Unnerved? Scared? 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what to do with the ball, and it was coming right at me, and . 
. . " 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg stuck out his belly. The ball hit it and bounced into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 His employees fell to the ground in laughter. By the time they had risen, 
Rothenberg had already walked off the field, caring nothing about how he looked 
and everything about how he had scored.

AFTER PLAYOFF, U.S. OPEN HAS ELS TO PAY; GOLF: SOUTH AFRICAN BEATS ROBERTS ON 
SECOND SUDDEN-DEATH HOLE, IS FIRST FOREIGN-BORN WINNER SINCE 1981. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How do you win the U.S. Open? Simple, really. 
</P>
<P>
 On the second hole of a sudden-death playoff, the 20th playoff hole, the 92nd 
hole on the fifth day of play, you shoot par. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Ernie Els did Monday in scoring an improbable victory in the 94th 
U.S. Open's oppressive heat and suffocating pressure at Oakmont Country Club, 
where par for the course would have been an extremely good score. 
</P>
<P>
 Els, a 24-year-old big hitter with finesse from Johannesburg, South Africa, 
parred the second playoff hole to beat Loren Roberts and win his first major 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a dream come true for me," said the 6-foot-3 Els, whose victory marked a 
historic day in golf -- the first time foreign-born players had won the Masters 
and the U.S. Open in the same year. Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain won the 
Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 Els, the first foreign-born U.S. Open winner since David Graham in 1981 and 
only the fourth since 1927, began the day's playoff round, an 18-hole epic of 
bogey golf with Roberts and Scotsman Colin Montgomerie, in about the worst 
shape he could have imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 He started with a bogey, then took a triple bogey, soaring four over par after 
the first two holes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Horrific," Els called his start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought after two holes 'Man, what are you doing out here?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Then Els birdied No. 3, Roberts double-bogeyed No. 5 and the race was on. Els 
caught Roberts with a birdie on No. 7 and stayed within a shot the rest of the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 After 18 holes, Els and Roberts were still tied at 74 and went on to sudden 
death, minus Montgomerie, who exited with a 78. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only the second sudden-death playoff in U.S. Open history. The other 
was in 1990 at Medinah near Chicago, when Hale Irwin defeated Mike Donald on 
the first sudden-death hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Els and Roberts matched par on No. 10, the first sudden-death hole, but 
Roberts quickly found himself in deep trouble on the par-four, 378-yard 11th. 
</P>
<P>
 His drive landed deep in the right rough, 142 yards from the green, and his 
second shot, a nine-iron, landed in a green-guarding bunker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't have any chance to get it on the green," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for him, the ball was embedded in the lip of the bunker, so he 
could get only to within 30 feet of the hole with his third shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Els was on the green in two after his booming two-iron drive landed in the 
middle of the fairway, a rarity for all players most of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 As Els watched, Roberts' putt for par hit the back of the hole and spun out. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts closed his eyes and groaned, draping his putter back over his 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certainly not going to hang my head about the way I played," said 
Roberts, 38, who won his first PGA Tour event this year and is not widely 
known. ABC-TV's Brent Musburger called him Lorne Greene on Sunday's telecast. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it was Els' turn. All he needed to do was two-putt from 18 feet. He slid 
the first putt about 3 feet past the hole, but rolled the second straight into 
the cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Els won despite hitting only six of 20 fairways and 11 of 20 greens. 
</P>
<P>
 And the U.S. Open is supposed to be won by the steady grinder? 
</P>
<P>
 "You saying I'm not hitting it straight?" Els asked, jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, consider the evidence, and there was plenty of it. Els, Roberts and 
Montgomerie played the second hole in a collective six-over par -- triple 
bogey, double bogey, bogey. It was almost a shame they didn't have a fourth in 
the group so they could have attempted to bogey for the cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the third hole, Els had hit more bushes than fairways, one. He had 
scored a triple-bogey seven on No. 2 after his second shot landed beneath a 
bush behind the green and he had to take a stroke penalty for an unplayable 
lie. 
</P>
<P>
 It took 1 1/2 hours to play the first five holes, after which Roberts, Els and 
Montgomerie were a combined 10 over. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomerie had taken himself out of the running by the 11th hole, by which 
time he had three double bogeys and two bogeys after having made the turn with 
a hefty 42. 
</P>
<P>
 His chances seemed to sour at No. 6, the first of the four par-three holes, 
after he had taken double bogeys on Nos. 2 and No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 He missed a five-foot putt for a birdie and the ball slid eight feet past the 
hole. Then he missed that one too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, I am very disappointed," Montgomerie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until it was too late, nearly all Montgomerie's shots deserted him. He played 
as if a chip was something salted that came in a bag. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13th and 14th holes were remarkable in that they were the first two in 
order that the trio played without at least one bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I turned to Colin a couple of times and said, 'We're not playing very well,' 
" Els said. "I guess it was just good enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Els walked into the clubhouse carrying the U.S. Open trophy and walked out 
carrying big expectations, including a special anointing by Jack Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've said for a long time, some guy is going to come along big and strong and 
have a touch, and we may have him," Nicklaus said of Els. "He's already a very 
good player, but so darned young. He has a great opportunity. He is probably 
your golfer of the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Els said it's probably too soon to put a label on him, mainly because winning 
the U.S. Open is still sinking in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always wanted to win a major championship (and) it's coming pretty early 
for me," he said. "Hopefully I'll be ready for it. If people want to label me 
the next great whatever, fine. I'll do it my own way." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday at Oakmont, his own way was fine.

JIM MURRAY: THESE GUYS PLAY BY DIFFERENT RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You know, when you and I played golf over the years, it was a game of "You hit 
it there, you play it there." Nobody had any real need for the rule book. You 
never got any free drops or rights to place the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ernie Els would not be the U.S. Open champion today if the pros played the 
kind of game we played. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, on the first hole Sunday, Ernie hit a wild hook off to the left 
of the fairway into the deep rough. The TV announcers described him as having 
"no chance" to hit the green. He was looking at a double bogey. At least. 
</P>
<P>
 All of a sudden, he gets to drop it back in the clear, where he gets an open 
shot and a chance at a birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 You think the guys at Fox Hills in the old days would have let you get away 
with that kind of carrying on? You'd get kicked out of the foursome. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pros today are like clever criminal lawyers. They never panic when 
they do something awful. They know there's a law out there somewhere that will 
mitigate the penalty, maybe even wipe it out. You can, so to speak, overrule 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the grandstand rule. This is a little refinement that came in since golf 
became a certified sit-down-and-watch sport. It used to be you "galleried" this 
game, i.e., you walked around with the contestants. Now, they put up 
grandstands around some of the greens. 
</P>
<P>
 The pros love these. Even back in the early days, Hogan used to say he liked a 
crowd around the green, the denser the better. You could fire at the flag 
knowing that even if your shot was long, it would be stopped by the spectator 
mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Grandstands are even better. That's because even if you hit a horrible shot, 
if it hits the grandstand, it doesn't matter. You get a free drop. Nearer the 
hole. You may be better off than a guy who doesn't hit grandstands, who hits 
the green even.  
</P>
<P>
 Young Master Els was the beneficiary of this kind of modern USGA largess on 
No. 17 in the final round. He hit a savage smother hook off the tee, so bad it 
wound up behind the grandstand. If the grandstand's not there, he's lucky to 
make six. But from his drop area, he gets a four. Could have been three.  
</P>
<P>
 The gang at Bel Air wouldn't pay you on that kind of monkey business. 
</P>
<P>
 But it goes on all the time on tour. Some guy hits shots up to a hole that 
would be headed onto the Pennsylvania Turnpike if the seats and spectators 
weren't there. He'd be hunting his ball for a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the USGA gave Els his free drop on No. 1 by mistake. He's entitled 
to it only if the obstruction he faced is immovable. It was not. As a matter of 
fact, it was later moved. Officials regularly give pros breaks because of TV 
cables, microphone positions and assorted imaginary obstructions.  
</P>
<P>
 It was that kind of a tournament anyway. You know, a U.S. Open is designed to 
run the ribbon clerks out of the game. But of late, it seems bent on running 
them in. 
</P>
<P>
 I have seldom seen a more motley cast of characters coming down the fairway in 
search of the U.S. Open title than greeted us Monday morning: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Colin Montgomerie looked like someone's aunt, the first guy in history to 
try to win the U.S. Open with a slice. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Loren Roberts is so little known that the TV announcer referred to him as 
Lorne Greene. He has won only one tournament in 14 years on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ernie Els is going to be a great player but he made so many mistakes coming 
down the final 36 that you were reminded of the Open in which Ben Hogan 
finished and then told the press, "The kid I played with would have won the 
Open by five shots if he had a brain in his head." 
</P>
<P>
 The "kid" was a 20-year-old amateur -- name of Jack Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, back in the booth, an announcer kept telling us that Els or 
Montgomerie would be the fourth foreigner in history to win the Open, naming 
Tony Jacklin, David Graham and Gary Player as the only others. Actually, the 
first 16 U.S. Opens were won by foreigners, English- or Scottish-born. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcer also told us Hale Irwin was "the only man to win three Opens." 
Well, maybe the three is correct. But what about Nicklaus, Hogan, Willie 
Anderson and Bobby Jones? They all won four. Don't you have to win three to win 
four?  
</P>
<P>
 It came down to a playoff featuring some of the sloppiest golf this side of a 
member-guest tournament at Burning Tree. If these three guys had showed up at a 
public links in Dallas, the hustlers would have been selling raffle tickets on 
a chance to get into a game with them. The playoff trio missed so many fairways 
and greens, you wondered what their handicaps were. I know some guys at Riviera 
could give them two a side.  
</P>
<P>
 What happened was, the game came down to match play, which the modern player 
has no idea how to do. It's a lost art. Walter Hagen would have had these guys 
in a straitjacket by the turn. They were 15-over at the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 It was like winning the batting championship with a .289 average. It wasn't 
even good enough to be described as winning ugly.  
</P>
<P>
 But, take heart. We're going to take a leaf from their book. The next time you 
send a wild approach shot screaming 40 yards to the right of a green and off in 
the trees, you shout, "We'll make believe there's a grandstand there! I get to 
drop on the fringe -- no penalty!" 
</P>
<P>
 And if you hit it far left off the tee, you get to put it back on the fairway, 
explaining, "If this were the U.S. Open, there'd be a camera there!" 
</P>
<P>
 It's only fair, isn't it? Why shouldn't we get the same breaks these guys get? 
Next time you get on the tee with the guys, you say, "Let's pretend there's a 
forklift out there!" And if they say, "Out where?" you say, "Wherever this ball 
lands!" 
</P>
<P>
 Fore!

NBA FINALS; A FO-FUM SERIES; EWING'S GOOSE EGGS AREN'T GOLDEN AS OLAJUWON 
CONTROLS THE BEANSTALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Once upon a time in the busy kingdom of New York, there lived a giant 
possessed of such power and grace, the villagers chose him to represent them in 
games against the other villages. 
</P>
<P>
 The giant was shy and soft-spoken and hated standing out in crowds. However, 
he was good at games and liked the coins he earned by the cartload. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the other New York players weren't very good and New York 
always lost. Other giants claimed the golden ring, such as the wicked Bill 
Laimbeer from the duchy of Detroit and the creaky Bill Cartwright of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Since New York was the biggest village of all, this was difficult to accept. 
The villagers wept and cursed their giant sometimes, although he was powerless 
to do more. 
</P>
<P>
 He tried not to hold it against them. He knew their lives were hard, living 
all packed in on top of each other, and they got crazy about their games. 
</P>
<P>
 They besieged him with their entreaties. 
</P>
<P>
 He never knew what to say. 
</P>
<P>
 The process continues to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's a mad, mad world for New York's Patrick Ewing, matched against Hakeem 
Olajuwon, the world's very finest giant, and losing. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ewing's last game, he went six for 20. He had 20 misses in Game 3 and 20 
more in Game 4. He is shooting 36% in this series and getting outscored by 
Olajuwon, eight points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hakeem's playing ball," Ewing says. "I'm playing ball, the Knicks are playing 
ball, Houston's playing ball. That's it. 
</P>
<P>
 Is he surprised? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah. I'm just missing shots. I think I'm getting good shots, just missing 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 How has Olajuwon dominated him? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I think I'm playing an all-around game. Everybody's been making a big 
thing out of my scoring. I think I'm playing an all-around game. I'm 
rebounding. I'm blocking shots. I'm playing good defense." 
</P>
<P>
 He knows Game 7 Wednesday night will affect the way the world looks at him. 
Does he ever think about that? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Can he put into perspective what this game means to him? 
</P>
<P>
 "It means a lot. I'm tired of answering -- hey, you guys, I'm answering the 
same questions over and over again. It means a lot. It's been a long time 
coming. Just have to come out and get the job done on Wednesday. Thanks, 
folks." 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing ambles off, 12 minutes into the 30-minute media session. It's about his 
average departure time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is actually Ewing at his most public. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first nine seasons, before the Knicks made an NBA finals in which 
players are ordered to attend media sessions, he rarely gave interviews on days 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 He talked after games. He was never rude but never expansive, either.  
</P>
<P>
 When reporters went away, he was down to earth. Those meeting him always said 
the same thing, how surprised they were. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought he was cold," says Doc Rivers, who joined the Knicks last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he's not that at all. He's very open with the team, laughing all the 
time. People assumed I knew him because I play in the league, but you don't." 
</P>
<P>
 On the U.S. Olympic team in 1992, Larry Bird was stunned to learn how nice 
Ewing was. They are still close friends. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not easy getting that close. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Jamaica, Ewing arrived in Boston when he was 11. He had a heavy accent 
and towered awkwardly above everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone looked at me like some kind of freak," he once told the Boston 
Globe's Jackie MacMullan. "The older guys taunted me. They told me I would 
never be anything. They said I would never learn the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I couldn't understand why they said those things. But I got used to 
it. And I learned not to let what anyone said affect me." 
</P>
<P>
 He became a star at Cambridge's Rindge & Latin High, the first prep ever to be 
invited to try out for the U.S. Olympic team. He was cut, but didn't embarrass 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing was an average student but his coach, Mike Jarvis, drafted a list of 
requirements of colleges recruiting him: Patrick had to be given untimed tests. 
He had to be allowed to tape lectures. 
</P>
<P>
 The list somehow became public, leading to a common misperception: Patrick 
can't read -- which became the chant when his team played at Boston College, 
which he had rejected when he chose Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing spent four stormy years at Georgetown. Taunts from opposing fans crossed 
the line into racism. Thompson's program, which had once been merely 
protective, closed around Ewing and was derided as Hoya Paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson played physical basketball and was not one to back down, and his 
teams duked their way through the early '80s. Once at Boston College, Ewing 
fought 5-foot-10 Michael Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe it when I got to the NBA and I finally talked to him," 
Adams said. "He was a totally different person. Calm. Very nice. I told him, 
'Man, you had me fooled.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, however, Ewing's reputation was secure: He was college 
basketball's biggest villain. 
</P>
<P>
 The image softened when he went to the NBA in 1985. With the Knicks, the 
turmoil was managerial. 
</P>
<P>
 General managers and coaches came and went, almost annually. The team wallowed 
in mediocrity. When the Bulls eliminated the Knicks in a three-game sweep in 
1991, fans tore up the life-size posters of Ewing they had been handed on their 
way in. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, he campaigned to get out of New York, even after the Knicks had 
hired Pat Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley had to sweat it out his first Knick summer as Ewing filed a grievance, 
claiming the Knicks had breached his contract. When he lost the grievance, 
Ewing demanded to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-August, Riley went to Washington, where Ewing lived. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked at me and said, 'Coach, why is it going to be any different with 
you?' " Riley said later. "And, 'I had six other coaches tell me the same 
thing. They came in, they sat me down, (they said) it's going to be different.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And I couldn't guarantee him anything. I told him about a dream I had. I 
don't know if it had any impact on him, but he was sitting there with his wife, 
Rita, and I told them about this vision . . . I don't know what street they go 
down? Is it Broadway? Is it Fifth Avenue? I saw the confetti coming out. I said 
'One day we're going to have that here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, only the Rangers have had a parade.  
</P>
<P>
 Ewing, at 32, is on the back slope of his career. He has already set a finals 
record for blocked shots, 28, and has outrebounded Olajuwon, 77-54. Whatever 
happens will not be a consequence of lack of effort or heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing remains a prisoner of Seventh Avenue. The Knicks' crack publicity 
department was sorely embarrassed when it couldn't put him together with Sports 
Illustrated's Rick Reilly, who was doing a long profile. The profile was 
published anyway, with nothing from Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
 With Ewing, what you see is all you get. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Patrick is going to have to do to be remembered, to be considered great, 
is win," Riley told Reilly. "That's how he's been slotted: For you, Patrick, 
the ultimate criteria, because you're not open to us, because we don't know 
anything about your private life, will be on the court. You've got to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "The headline I hope to see for Patrick the day he wears that ring is 
'FINALLY.' "

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; BRAZIL DESERVES SOME EXTRA POINTS FOR 
STYLE; GROUP B: THE SCORE WAS ONLY 2-0, BUT THE DOMINANCE OF RUSSIA WAS MUCH 
MORE COMPLETE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was like the giant spectator wave that kept rolling around and around old 
Stanford Stadium Monday. It was the Brazilian soccer team, and its debut in the 
World Cup resembled one of those old Western movies, where the cavalry keeps 
charging and charging and charging. 
</P>
<P>
 To Russian goaltender Dmitri Kharine, Brazil must have seemed like a team of 
hundreds. That Kharine gave up only two goals in Brazil's 2-0 victory is 
commendable, considering most of the 15 other shots Brazil took were viable, 
close-in scoring chances. 
</P>
<P>
 He actually gave up only one goal during continual play -- that to Romario -- 
and another on a penalty kick to Rai, after one of his defenders actually was 
called for one of the frequent muggings perpetrated on Brazil's forwards. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he thought he'd had a chance to stop Romario's goal, which came in 
the 26th minute off a corner kick from Bebeto and was achieved despite Russian 
defender Vladislav Ternavsky's grabbing everything but Romario's car keys, 
Kharine said, "I guess you could say I had a chance, but it was Romario." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, this was no mere mortal he was being asked to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 There rests the gist of a problem that the favored Brazilians face in this 
event. Not only are they expected to win, they are expected to do so both 
convincingly and artistically. It is a pedestal of great height resting on a 
narrow, slippery base. 
</P>
<P>
 The great expectations spring from the fanaticism of followers perhaps unlike 
any others in the world. They wear yellow shirts, paint their faces green and 
chant and bang drums for hours before the game and for hours after it. And they 
travel worldwide, turning most Brazilian games into Brazilian home games. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, they flooded the streets and neighborhoods around Stanford Stadium 
before the game, waving their flags, singing their songs and teasing the 
traffic cops. Then they flooded the stadium, where attendance was announced at 
81,061 and where the dominant color was yellow. 
</P>
<P>
 They love their team and they love their fun. But they are also soccer fans, 
which means they love to win and they have a ready target in case they don't. 
After providing thunderous applause to greet their team, Brazilian fans greeted 
the introduction of Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira with mostly silence, then a 
scattering of boos. 
</P>
<P>
 The second area of expectation is more subtle, and, if you are Brazil's soccer 
team, almost unfairly burdensome. Simply put, world and U.S. soccer officials 
badly need World Cup '94 to be a smash hit. A successful U.S. pro league will 
make the sport truly global, not to mention filthy rich. 
</P>
<P>
 But that is unlikely to be achieved with anything less than a shocking result 
from the U.S. team or a spectacular athletic show by a spectacular athletic 
team. Since the U.S. prospects of going past the round of 16 -- or even getting 
to it -- are not great, that leaves the hope for a spectacular team. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this showed clearly in the aftermath of Monday's 2-0 victory. Brazil 
had dominated, outclassed and totally defeated the Russians. Had it been a 
baseball game, it would have been 16-1. But it was greeted mostly with shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian Coach Pavel Sadyrin said, "It is always bad to lose, but today, it was 
more explainable." In other words, the Brazilians are so good, it is OK to lose 
to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilian midfielder Rai said, "This was expected by the Brazilian people, and 
now, in our next games, we will be more free flowing." 
</P>
<P>
 Contributing to the sea of yellow in Stanford Stadium Monday were yellow hats, 
thousands of them, produced and somehow mass distributed by Nike, the master of 
never missing a marketing trick. They read, "Just Do It, Brasil." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Brazilians in World Cup '94, that's more than merely a slogan. It's a 
mandate.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; U.S. PREFERS TO LOOK AT THE STANDINGS AS 
HALF-FULL; GROUP A: AMERICANS HAPPY TO BE HOME, BUT THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT 
MISTAKES WERE MADE AGAINST SWITZERLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The U.S. World Cup team tried to walk a thin rhetorical line Monday, seeking 
to diminish the significance of Romania's unexpected victory over Colombia -- 
the next U.S. opponent -- and somehow find the up side to an unsatisfying tie 
against Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 A new week brought a new mantra that roughly translated to: We're home and now 
we'll regroup. The relief was palpable at the U.S. practice, back in the 
familiar confines of the U.S. training center in Mission Viejo. Relief that the 
Midwestern heat wave had been left behind and the players could now train in a 
less-draining climate. 
</P>
<P>
 There was talk of the point gained against Switzerland in Saturday's tie, as 
opposed to the opportunity to gain two additional points the team might have 
squandered with its inability to play the ball forward. The U.S. midfielders 
accepted their portion of the responsibility for the poor showing. 
</P>
<P>
 The usually reliable Thomas Dooley played a sub-par game and spent much of his 
time running from crisis to crisis to help out. The team has run into similar 
problems when Dooley, a tireless runner, tries to do too much damage control in 
other players' territories and neglects his own assignments.  
</P>
<P>
 "When we get the ball from the defense we need to keep the ball in the 
midfield," Dooley said. "When we have the ball we need to make our touch good. 
My first five, six touches were a mistake. I got more nervous. So I tried to 
play every time a good long ball so I could get more confidence, more touch. 
There are balls that were wrong. If we keep the ball in the midfield, it's much 
easier for us to play our game." 
</P>
<P>
 Defender Cle Kooiman also acknowledged he had not been happy with his play, 
even though he was playing right outside defender, a position he had played 
only three times. Although he was able to tackle and win the ball, Kooiman was 
not successful in then playing the ball to a teammate to launch the 
counterattack. Much of the time he was able only to kick the ball out of 
bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are allowed one of those (bad days), but not in the World Cup," Kooiman 
said. "I won't make the same mistakes again, you can be sure of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Point calculation was another topic. Four points is the generally accepted 
figure that will move a team from the first round to the second, which means 
the United States must win one of its next two games to advance. Because 
Colombia comes into Wednesday's game with no points, the possibility of a 
blowout looms. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic extended his positive-thinking agenda to the 
Colombians, who have been pilloried since their loss, which the U.S. coach 
claimed not to have seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Colombia lost that game, but it's only one game," Milutinovic said. "Colombia 
continues to be one of the favorites of this World Cup. I don't think much has 
changed."

MANY CRITICS ARE BOTHERED BY CONCENTRATION OF POWER

<P>
 The soccer community has leveled most of its criticism at Alan Rothenberg 
because of his apparent desire to control all parts of soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg was elected president of the U.S. Soccer Federation, but in four 
years he has also taken over the World Cup effort and the proposed professional 
league, Major League Soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have charged that three men should be running the separate entities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throughout the federation, the perception is that Alan is wearing too many 
hats," said Edward Eid, a member of the Colorado Soccer Federation's board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rothenberg: "What some people call a conflict of interest, I call a 
confluence of interest. We need all of these things working together." 
</P>
<P>
 More eyebrows were raised when money -- about $2 million -- was funneled from 
nonprofit World Cup USA 94, Inc., to the for-profit pro league as a start-up 
loan, with Rothenberg in charge of both operations. 
</P>
<P>
 MLS is scheduled to begin play next summer, but as of early June, had not even 
chosen all the cities with teams.  
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg says FIFA, soccer's world governing body, mandated that his World 
Cup group use 30% of its funds to begin the new pro league. It is a claim 
others refute. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg put himself in charge of the league after submitting a business 
plan that was accepted by the USSF. 
</P>
<P>
 It has become such a sticky issue that Rothenberg has asked the IRS for a tax 
ruling, even though two independent tax-law firms said there were no problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything has been according to the original script," said Rothenberg, 
referring to FIFA mandates and World Cup board approvals. "There has been no 
criticisms until a couple of people, for their own political purposes, had 
ambitions to run for presidency of the USSF and had to look for some issue, and 
they created it." BILL PLASCHKE

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; TODAY'S GAME AT A GLANCE

 GROUP C at Soldier Field, Chicago 
</P>
<P>
 Germany vs. Spain 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 1:05 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ESPN, Univision, KSCI (German) 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: The faltering German offense versus Spanish goalkeeper Andoni 
Zubizaretta seems to be the key contest that will develop. Zubizaretta was 
absent from Spain's opening match because of a red card he received in the 
final qualifying game against Denmark. The Germans looked altogether ordinary 
in their 1-0 victory over Bolivia in the tournament opener and Coach Berti 
Vogts will be expecting them to pick up the pace against a stronger opponent. 
Spain has a workmanlike, if unspectacular team, that has the ability to shut 
out Germany unless Juergen Klinsmann and company can do better than they did 
against Bolivia. Much will depend on the play of midfielder Andreas Moeller and 
Thomas Haessler, who will have the task of opening up the Spanish defense. On 
offense, Spain will be looking to striker Julio Salinas, who scored against 
South Korea, aided by midfielder Fernando Hierro. Team captain Miguel Angel 
Nadal will be missing because of a red card received in the team's first match. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: If Spain loses, it will not be the end of the world. It will still 
have Bolivia to play and must consider itself the favorite in that match, which 
it would have to win to reach the next round. If Germany loses, it would not 
hurt its chances of advancing, either, since it already has three points and 
only South Korea still to play. But the Germans don't lose that often and Spain 
doesn't really want to begin with a tie and a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: A tie seems most likely, but the Spanish will have to work for it, 
otherwise the Germans have six points and are the first team to reach the 
second round. A Spanish victory? Unthinkable. GRAHAME L. JONES

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; ANALYSIS; SAUDIS JUST MISSED PULLING IT 
OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saudi Arabia had a 10-page special supplement published in the Washington Post 
Monday morning touting the country's many assets. 
</P>
<P>
 It missed at least five. 
</P>
<P>
 Their names are Faud Amin, Majed Mohammed, Saeed Al Owairan, Abdullah Al 
Dossari and Mohammed Al Deayea. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that Saudi Arabia lost to the Netherlands, 2-1, in front of a 
less-than-sellout crowd of 52,535 at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium here Monday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that Saudi Arabia came within 40 minutes of scoring one of the 
greatest upsets in World Cup history. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that Saudi youth and inexperience eventually bowed to superior 
Dutch teamwork and relentless Dutch pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 None of that really matters. 
</P>
<P>
 For what the Saudis accomplished even in defeat was to lift their nation -- in 
soccer terms -- from the ranks of the insignificant and the also-rans and onto 
the international stage. 
</P>
<P>
 In future World Cup tournaments, when Saudi teams suddenly start winning and 
actually are expected to do well, it will be this Saudi team that will have 
provided the foundation and the impetus for that future glory. 
</P>
<P>
 And Amin, Mohammed, Owairan, Dossari and Deayea will be names that will be 
remembered the longest. Between them, they almost did the impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 The Netherlands came into the game with a proud World Cup history, having 
taken part in five previous tournaments and having finished as runner-up in 
1974 and 1978. In 34 World Cup games, the Dutch had compiled an overall record 
of 20 wins, six losses and eight ties. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, Coach Dick Advocaat's talent-laden team was -- and probably still is 
-- considered one of the tournament favorites, only slightly behind Brazil and 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Saudis? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, they came in as 500-to-1 underdogs, sporting the longest odds of all 24 
teams. They came in as virtual unknowns, with only Mohammed having established 
a reputation beyond Saudi Arabia's borders. Dubbed "The Desert Pele," Mohammed 
is his country's first true soccer star, but he is also 35 and showing it. Too 
old to be a forward, surely. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the rest, well, there was Owairan, a forward of considerable skill and 
promise but lacking big-match experience. Beyond that, the Saudis had precious 
little except for an unyielding faith in themselves and ample financial backing 
from the seemingly bottomless coffers of the Saudi royal family. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saudis were the first team to arrive in the United States, coming in a 
full month before the tournament kicked off. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, by the time Monday's game arrived, they were ready. 
</P>
<P>
 The match was less than a minute old when Saudi Arabia signaled that it would 
not be easily brushed aside by the Dutch. A cross by overlapping defender 
Dosarri found Mohammed unmarked at the far post and his header flew just wide 
to the left. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a sign of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, the Dutch had been thrown completely off their rhythm and there 
were anxious faces among the gaudily clad Holland faithful in the stands.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dutch played their typical game, attacking and defending in numbers. They 
came at the Saudis in wave after wave, but invariably their finishing let them 
down. Dennis Bergkamp, Marc Overmars and Ronald Koeman all shot high or wide. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the Dutch were on target, Deayea was there to save the day.  
</P>
<P>
 Pretty soon, it was the Saudis who were attacking. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Dutch in disarray, it was a surprise, but not a huge one, when the 
Saudis took the lead on Amin's excellent header. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, fouls and rugged tackles were how the Dutch responded from then on. 
They continued to play attractive soccer, but there was more of a bite in their 
challenges, more of a snarl than a smile on their lips. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dutch assault did not abate in the second half, even though they had tied 
the score courtesy of Wim Jonk's tremendous shot. Before long, Owairan, too, 
had limped off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The teeth had been pulled from the Saudi lion and it was only a matter of time 
before the Dutch delivered the killer blow. 
</P>
<P>
 Deayea kept the Netherlands at bay for as long as he could with some brave 
goalkeeping, but in the end the Dutch prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Having been given a scare by the Saudis, the Dutch will be more respectful of 
their future opponents, including Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
 Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, can remember the words of its Argentine coach, Jorge 
Solari, who after the game was over said the difference between the two teams 
was only a matter of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Not skill. Not heart. Only experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Saudi Arabia will be back.

ABC CALLS AN AUDIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Television coverage of Monday's U.S. Open playoff was confusing. ABC had 
announced Sunday that coverage would run from 7-9:30 a.m. on ESPN and from 9:30 
to conclusion on ABC.But Monday, ABC decided not to pick up coverage until 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Then when the playoff went into sudden death, ABC preempted the coverage 
during the first extra hole to cover the arraignment of O.J. Simpson. 
Fortunately for ABC, it was able to rejoin the golf tournament before 
conclusion and showed highlights of the missed hole. LARRY STEWART

LOPEZ LEAVING PEPPERDINE FOR FLORIDA; COLLEGE BASEBALL: FORMER UCLA PLAYER 
COACHED WAVES TO NATIONAL TITLE IN 1992. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andy Lopez, who coached Pepperdine's baseball team to the 1992 national 
championship and three other NCAA playoff appearances in six seasons, resigned 
Monday to coach at Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, 40, succeeds Joe Arnold, who retired June 1 after 11 seasons with the 
Gators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm indebted to Pepperdine for the opportunity the university gave me, and 
I'm looking forward to a new challenge," said Lopez, whose Pepperdine teams 
were 241-107. "This isn't just a move to improve professionally. I think I'm 
going into a situation that is going to be good for my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, who played at San Pedro High and UCLA and coached six seasons at Cal 
State Dominguez Hills before moving to Pepperdine, has been perhaps the hottest 
commodity in college coaching since Pepperdine won its national title two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently turned down an offer to succeed the retired Bobo Brayton at 
Washington State, and was also considered a leading candidate for the opening 
at Arizona State, where longtime coach Jim Brock died June 12 of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Foley, Florida's athletic director, reportedly phoned Lopez and 
inquired about his interest in the Gator job an hour after Arnold resigned. 
Lopez met with Foley and other Florida officials in Gainesville last week and 
was offered a package that apparently was too lucrative to decline. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is, it was mind-boggling," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources told The Times that Lopez will receive a five-year contract with a 
base salary of about $140,000 a year. He will receive additional money from 
contracts for radio and television shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez inherits a team that finished 40-23 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida, which competes in the Southeastern Conference, has a full complement 
of 11.7 baseball scholarships and is building a new clubhouse at one of college 
baseball's finest facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a chance to do some things at Florida every year that would be 
impossible or take years to achieve at other schools," Lopez said. "The state 
of Florida has some great players, but I'll still have a presence on the West 
Coast. I'll be recruiting here, and hopefully we can bring some schools from 
Southern California to Gainesville (for games)." 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Wright, Pepperdine's athletic director, said a search for Lopez's 
replacement will begin immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Picciolo, a former Pepperdine standout and major league player, is 
considered a candidate. So are Oklahoma assistant Pat Harrison and former Wave 
coach Dave Gorrie. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez's departure is probably the first of several moves expected to affect 
the Southland coaching community. Dave Snow of Long Beach State is considered a 
top candidate for the Arizona State job, and George Horton, associate coach at 
Cal State Fullerton, has reportedly been offered the job at Washington State.

ERVINE'S SCORING VISION PROVIDES GRAND RESULTS FOR THE SPLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dale Ervine is a man of vision, which is to say he knows what he has seen and 
doesn't want to suffer the same fate. 
</P>
<P>
 He has seen the talented come and go long before their time. 
</P>
<P>
 He has seen the marginal enjoy success and win championships. 
</P>
<P>
 He is old in the indoor soccer game and wise from the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ervine, aptly named to become an Orange County star, has already shown Splash 
fans the fruits of his dedication. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been everything management could want -- a scorer, a leader, a coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Through four games, he has nine goals and six assists, figures he hopes to add 
to Wednesday when the Splash (4-0) play host to the Detroit Neon (0-3) at The 
Pond of Anaheim. He is second in the league in total points (15) and goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Hat tricks in the Splash's first two games garnered him player of the week 
honors in the Continental Indoor Soccer League, and he also had the 
game-winning shootout goal in a 10-9 victory over Detroit Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He brings a lot of stability to this team," said Doug Neely, who played 
against Ervine the past seven years, but now only faces him in practice. "He 
knows when to pump everyone up and when to calm people down. Everyone looks to 
Dale to get a feel for things. We feed off his experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Ervine, 30, spent his first eight seasons with the Wichita Wings -- six years 
in the Major Soccer League and the past two in the National Professional Soccer 
League that plays during the winter. He has scored 467 points in 338 games over 
that span, including 305 goals. In 1990-91, he scored 62 times in 52 games. 
Over the past winter, he scored 62 goals in 38 games, and he also played last 
year outdoors with the Salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt he's one of the greatest forwards to ever play this 
(indoors) game," said Splash Coach George Fernandez, who isn't allowed an 
official assistant coach by league rules, but admits Ervine serves as one. 
</P>
<P>
 Ervine himself is optimistic, prone to cliches and a smile. His speed is 
deceptive, he's strong, and he uses the defender's body as leverage to get the 
shot off. 
</P>
<P>
 "You think you've got him shut down," Neely said, "and all of a sudden, he's 
shooting it and it's in the back of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in Kansas City in 1990-91, I was playing really tight on him and 
they knocked the ball into him and he got it off before I could even react. 
You're mad at yourself, but nobody's blaming you because you're just helpless." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't always that way. Coming out of UCLA where he led the Bruins in 
scoring for three seasons and to an NCAA championship in 1985, Ervine began his 
pro career as a defender. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time there were a lot of foreign players, and I was a young American 
guy coming out of school," Ervine said. "(The attitude was) 'Let's put him in 
the back where he's always facing the play.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But the turning point in his career came during his fourth season, 1989-90. He 
was moved to forward, his college position, and everything seemed natural. He 
scored a few goals in a preseason game, and then a few more, "and then I 
started to expect myself to do it into the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Ervine has scored 269 goals in 202 games and totaled 345 points -- 
phenomenal figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always kept the frame of mind that you're only as good as your last 
game," Ervine said, "and the most important game is the next one because if 
that next one's not good, that's what people remember. Maybe that helps me in 
trying to keep some sense of consistency in my play." 
</P>
<P>
 No one can doubt Ervine's consistency or his marketability. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting Dale Ervine was one of our major priorities," said Tim Orchard, 
Splash co-governor and director of player personnel. "We got a star indoor 
player who lives in Orange County (Yorba Linda)." 
</P>
<P>
 Orchard and the Splash have been aggressive in trying to assemble the best 
talent in the Continental Indoor Soccer League. Ervine, who was raised in 
Torrance, and Rod Castro give the team two of the best scorers in the CISL.  
</P>
<P>
 But Ervine refuses to rest on his past as he looks to the Splash's future, and 
the championship he hopes to bring to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen too many guys who are content with what they've done in the past," 
Ervine said, ". . . (and) when you look over the long term, for whatever 
reason, a lot of people seem to fade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst thing in the world for anybody in any business is complacency, and 
once that sets in, I think you're in trouble. Once you start walking around 
patting yourself on the back -- feeling really good about yourself, whether 
it's individually or as a team -- things will change quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to be successful, you have to expect to be successful. You have to 
have dreams and set goals. You have to push yourself or you'll stay at the same 
level while the guys who are pushing themselves and the teams who are expecting 
to win will pass you by." 
</P>
<P>
 Ervine has seen it happen. He has avoided it.

PRESSURE TURNING PROMISING YOUNG TENNIS PLAYER AWAY FROM GAME; TENNIS: 
SARMIENTO, A 16-YEAR-OLD FROM BOLIVIA, HAS BECOME ONE OF BEST PLAYERS IN AREA, 
BUT NOW SAYS HE NEEDS A BREAK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carlo Sarmiento, like Jennifer Capriati, has had a tennis racket in his hand 
since he was barely old enough to walk. And Sarmiento's father, like 
Capriati's, provided the racket. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sarmiento, like Capriati, may be driven from the sport at a young age. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarmiento was talented enough to beat much older players at an early age. By 
12, he was the 14-year-old age-division champion in his native Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after Sarmiento conquered Bolivia, George Sarmiento sold his 
business and land and moved his wife, daughter and son to Newport Beach in 
search of better competition for his son. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlo Sarmiento has yet to conquer this country, but he has done quite well in 
Southern California. At 14, Sarmiento was ranked No. 1 in the boys' 14 
division. At 16, he is the region's second-best player in the boys' 18 division 
to Huntington Beach's Jakub Pietrowski, who has beaten Sarmiento twice this 
year in close matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Pietrowski, who recently graduated from Ocean View High and won the Southern 
Section singles title this year, never had to face Sarmiento in a high school 
match because Sarmiento, like Capriati, barely bothered to attend school. 
</P>
<P>
 Pietrowski and Sarmiento probably would have met again Sunday in the Southern 
California Sectional tournament finals, but Sarmiento won't be playing. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, he has been declared ineligible by the Southern California 
Tennis Assn., which ruled that he didn't meet certain requirements. But even if 
he did, it is doubtful he would have played, because Sarmiento, like Capriati, 
is tired of tennis, tired of being pressured, and tired of doing something he 
doesn't love. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike Capriati, Sarmiento has chosen religion as a diversion. Sarmiento 
is spending a lot of time these days at Kingdom Hall in Costa Mesa, studying 
the Bible and learning to become a Jehovah's Witness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've tried all kinds of religions, but the one I really like is Jehovah's 
Witness," Sarmiento said. "Tennis is not going to give me everlasting life. God 
is. I really try and search for God. That's what gives you happiness in your 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Olson, who runs a junior tennis academy at the Balboa Bay Club, coached 
Sarmiento about 18 months and knew almost instantly that his student did not 
find happiness in tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times, he'd come to a lesson and just talk," said Olson, who also 
coaches Fullerton's Kevin Kim, the top-ranked 16-year-old in the nation. "Other 
times, he'd play for 45 minutes and then leave. Kevin Kim would finish with his 
lesson and then want to play for another hour." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Sarmiento has beaten Kim in junior tournaments, he acknowledges Kim is 
more suited for the game.  
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin can play for six hours and I can play for maybe two," Sarmiento said. 
"He's in great shape. I've never been in shape. But I can still beat him. I 
guess that's talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Kevin Kim and Newport Beach's (Geoff Abrams) didn't have school, they'd 
play all day. They love tennis. I like it." 
</P>
<P>
 If he had a choice, Sarmiento said he might have picked soccer over tennis. 
But Sarmiento said his father, who played professional tennis and taught the 
sport in Bolivia, never gave him a choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad kind of pushed me into tennis," Sarmiento said. "He put a lot of 
pressure on me, but I know he only wanted what was best for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Olson doesn't doubt that George Sarmiento wants the best for his son, but 
Olson said that is part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "My personal opinion is that Carlo is tired of tennis because he's spoiled," 
Olson said. "He's never had to work hard. Everything's always been given to him 
by his dad. If he wants to get to the next level, he sees he'd have to work 
really hard. He doesn't really want to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 George Sarmiento, who teaches tennis at the Balboa Bay Club with Olson, 
acknowledges that what Olson says is true. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carlo has always had everything -- his shoes, his rackets, he's traveled 
everywhere to play," George Sarmiento said. "But he's never put too much time 
into tennis. While all the other kids have all these coaches and work out six 
hours a day, Carlo plays one day a week and still beats everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 But while other kids are in school, Carlo Sarmiento is often in Europe or 
South America playing in tournaments. He has not attended school since 1992, 
when he spent two months at Corona del Mar High.  
</P>
<P>
 "His sponsor told us he didn't have time for school with all the travel," 
George Sarmiento said. "He promised me he'd get Carlo a tutor, but he never 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Olson, Sarmiento's sponsor, Bev Walker, never did much of 
anything he was supposed to. After signing Sarmiento to a five-year contract at 
the age of 14, Olson says Walker has broken many promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "He paid for a few of Carlo's trips early on to whet their appetite," Olson 
said. . "The bottom line is, he wanted to hold onto the kid to see if he was 
going to make it, so he could make some money. Now that he sees the kid might 
not make him any money, he doesn't want to follow through with the commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 Olson said Walker never followed through with his financial commitment to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I coached Carlo for 18 months and was never paid a cent," Olson said. "He 
wrote me three checks and they all bounced." 
</P>
<P>
 George Sarmiento said he is attempting to break the last three years of his 
contract with Walker, who lives in England and was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarmiento says he had many offers from professional coaches who wanted to 
teach his son tennis, including Andre Agassi's former coach Nick Bollettieri. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nick spent 45 minutes with Carlo and wanted to take him to his camp in 
Florida and make him a professional," George Sarmiento said. "I would have 
taken the offers if we didn't have the contract with Bev Walker." 
</P>
<P>
 But even if Carlo Sarmiento had gone to Florida with Bollettieri, it's 
doubtful he would have survived the rigorous demands of a tennis camp. 
Sometimes, Sarmiento has found it difficult to survive three-set matches. 
Earlier this year at a junior tournament in Whittier, Sarmiento had two match 
points on Pietrowski in the second set. But Pietrowski won the second set and 
then won the third, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I won the second set, I think he just gave up," Pietrowski said. "I 
don't know why. I can't even remember a time I could give up until the last 
point. If you have that chance, why let it go to waste?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pietrowski said Sarmiento would be wasting a talent if he decided to quit 
tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good all-around player," Pietrowski said. "He's improved a lot in the 
last year. It's a shame if doesn't play anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 If Sarmiento gives up tennis, he said the game itself won't be the reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game is real nice, but it's all the other things that I don't like," he 
said. "The sponsors, the pressure, the gossip." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarmiento said he has heard from many people that he has enough talent to make 
it in pro tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I hear it from coaches, it's fine, but my father says it too much," 
Sarmiento said. "People always tell me stuff like, 'You play so good. It's a 
gift from God. Don't waste this talent.' Well God didn't make this sport, and 
money doesn't make people happy." 
</P>
<P>
 If he wanted to play on the pro tour, Sarmiento said he could get to that 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe I can make it," he said. "I just don't know if I want to. I don't 
know if I want to travel. It's a tough life." 
</P>
<P>
 Olson said George Sarmiento has made his son's life that much tougher by not 
giving him enough space. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a lot of talks with George about leaving tennis on the tennis 
court," Olson said. "The best way for a parent to deal with their son or 
daughter is to build a relationship with your kids and let the coaches decide 
what to do with tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times, believe it or not, a coach is more realistic than the parent. 
He can see what makes the kids happy. Talking about tennis all day is not what 
makes kids happy. There has to be a balance in life." 
</P>
<P>
 George Sarmiento said he is often told by parents and coaches to give his son 
time away from tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "A mother of another player told me, 'Please, George, just let him alone for 
now,' " he said. "Some people have told me I have to be nice to him." 
</P>
<P>
 But George Sarmiento said he and his son have a good relationship, and it is 
nothing like that of Jim and Mary Pierce or Stefano and Jennifer Capriati. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get along OK," George Sarmiento said. "We have problems like everybody, 
but every father wants what's best for his son." 
</P>
<P>
 But Carlo Sarmiento says having the best life does not necessarily mean the 
most normal life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost quite a lot of my childhood," he said. "I was always lonely and had 
few friends. I want to learn new things now other than tennis. If I miss it, 
I'll come back. If not, then that's it." 
</P>
<P>
 George Sarmiento said he has heard his son talk like this before, and doesn't 
put much credence to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very good kid," George Sarmiento said. "It bothers me that he's 
putting all that time in his religion. He's just a little tired right now, 
that's all." 
</P>
<P>
 Olson said Carlo Sarmiento has often used the threat of quitting as a 
bargaining ploy with his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carlo doesn't have discipline in his life," Olson said. "His parents have 
asked him to go back to school, but he's always gotten his way. He's always 
threatened to quit tennis because he knows that is his father's weakness. His 
father will back off him for a while when he threatens him with that. Carlo is 
very manipulative." 
</P>
<P>
 Olson says he might know Carlo Sarmiento better than Carlo's father does. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will tell me things he won't tell his dad," said Olson, who said Carlo 
Sarmiento often spent the night at his house. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Olson's belief that Sarmiento will find it difficult to stay away from 
tennis for too long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Carlo will quit," Olson said. "I think he'll come back once he 
realizes tennis is all he's got." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, but this week Sarmiento is off on a camping trip to Santa Barbara 
trying to get tennis out of his mind. He says he told his father last Monday 
that he wants to take a break. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's disappointed," Carlo Sarmiento said. "Like every father, he wants the 
best for his son." 
</P>
<P>
 George Sarmiento says his son's break will be short. 
</P>
<P>
 "My opinion is he's going to start practicing after his break," he said. 
"He'll be more hungry."

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kansas State quarterback Chad May, a transfer from Cal State Fullerton, has 
been arrested for driving under the influence in Manhattan, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 May, 22, was arrested early Saturday after an officer observed him making an 
illegal turn, said Riley County Police Lt. Rodney Jager. 
</P>
<P>
 After the officer stopped the vehicle, he found probable cause for the DUI 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 May was released after posting $500 bond. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bill Snyder declined comment on the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior last fall in his first season with the Wildcats, May set school 
records by passing for 2,682 yards and 16 touchdowns. He also set a Big Eight 
record by passing for 489 yards against Nebraska. He was named all-conference 
quarterback in a vote of Big Eight coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 May was Fullerton's starting quarterback in 1991.

BUHNER PLAYS MANTLE TO KID'S MARIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Seattle Mariners presently feature the best home-run combination in 
baseball with Ken Griffey Jr., and that guy, you know with the shaved head, who 
bats behind him in the starting lineup.  
</P>
<P>
 OK, so maybe Jay Buhner falls a few dozen homers short of playing Mickey 
Mantle to Griffey's bid to surpass Roger Maris, but Buhner's 13th home run of 
the season Monday night took the focus off Griffey and started Randy Johnson on 
his way to a 5-0 victory over the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Junior wasn't out there for us tonight and we were able to pick up for him," 
said Buhner, who hit a two-run homer over the 370-foot mark in the third inning 
for the game's first runs. "I'm sure he gets a little tired and his shoulders 
get a little heavy from carrying us all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey went hitless in three at-bats with two walks, including an intentional 
pass in the ninth inning to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear the reaction of the fans -- they were booing -- they wanted him to 
hit, but I'd walk him, too," Buhner said. "Look at what he's done; he's the guy 
who's done all the damage. At this rate I'm curious myself to see just how far 
he goes." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey has 30 home runs to date and needs one more in the team's nine 
remaining games in June to break Babe Ruth's major league record for most 
homers by June 30. Throw in Buhner's 13 homers and the two Mariners pack an 
impressive wallop. 
</P>
<P>
 "The better Buhner hits, the better pitches our Junior is going to get," 
Seattle Manager Lou Piniella said. "There's no question about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Buhner, who has reached base successfully in 38 of his last 39 games, has hit 
.307 in his last six games. 
</P>
<P>
 "The home run was important because when Randy Johnson gets a lead early, the 
game's over," Buhner said. "He's an intimidator, and he's always coming after 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 Buhner sports an intimidating look with his shaved head and hard stare, but 
it's difficult to play the role of Hulk Hogan in the on-deck circle when 
Superman is whacking baseball after baseball over the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I get caught up in the excitement of what is happening with The 
Kid," Buhner said. "It's just great for the game that Junior is off to this 
start. I just stand there and watch like everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Buhner shook his head as if he had just seen Ruth in a vision and then pointed 
to Griffey. "The Kid is just awesome. Players like him don't come around that 
often. Let's be serious, it's obvious he's the best player in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Buhner knows home runs, too. He has averaged 25 a season the past three years, 
and while he currently has 13, he laughs at talk about what they have both 
accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was talking to Chili (Davis) before the game, and I was saying, 'Man, look 
at this kid, he's already got 30 and I've never hit 30 in a whole season in my 
career,' " Buhner said. "Chili said, 'No kidding, I haven't gotten there 
either.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, you hit 25-plus home runs and that's a great year."

SNOOZE ALERT; IT SEEMS NAP TIMES AREN'T JUST GOOD FOR THE PRESCHOOL SET. 
RESEARCHERS SAY IT'S TIME ADULTS WOKE UP TO THE DANGERS OF SLEEP DEPRIVATION. 
CATCHING A FEW ZS AT THE OFFICE COULD MEAN A MORE ALERT AND ORGANIZED EMPLOYEE 
-- AND HELP TO ENSURE A SAFER WORKPLACE.

<P>
 On a plump futon at Ben and Jerry's ice cream company, on the silky grass in 
the park next to Esprit headquarters, in soft-lit chambers above Levi's Plaza, 
a growing number of men and women are interrupting the workday to do what comes 
naturally: 
</P>
<P>
 Take a nap. 
</P>
<P>
 Like new parents and student doctors, firefighters and kindergartners, 
corporate America is discovering the restorative power of 20 to 30 minutes of 
sweet inertia. 
</P>
<P>
 And not a wink too soon, say sleep experts. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nation where 100 million citizens are seriously sleep deprived, taking a 
nap has become "a heroic act," says pioneer sleep researcher Dr. William Dement 
of Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with evidence from the laboratory that the human body is designed for 
not one but two sessions of sleep every 24 hours, Dement and other sleep 
specialists recently launched "Wake Up America 1994." It's a campaign designed 
both to boost sleep's image as a positive, even necessary, pastime and persuade 
more Americans to "take sleep seriously" -- especially naps. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget Homer Simpson and Dagwood Bumstead. People who break up the workday 
with a nap are putting to bed the myth that daytime sleep is an indulgence of 
dull, lazy or unmotivated workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, sleep experts say, prudent nappers may be among the more perceptive, 
organized, and aggressive employees -- once they get their Zs. 
</P>
<P>
 In his book "Stress and the Power Nap" -- billed as "the book designed to put 
you to sleep" -- St. Louis psychologist Dennis Shea calls on big business to 
embrace the nap as an economical quick-fix for burned-out execs. 
</P>
<P>
 While many could benefit from more sleep, those who need it most are workers 
whose drowsiness could endanger themselves or others. 
</P>
<P>
 Sleep deprivation may have contributed to some of the world's most frightening 
accidents: the poison gas leak at Bhopal, the near-meltdown at Three Mile 
Island, the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and the explosion of the Challenger 
space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 When the oil tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground shortly after midnight March 24, 
1989, the third mate at the helm, investigators determined, was "asleep on his 
feet." 
</P>
<P>
 The horror stories continue. Sleep or lack of it contributes to an estimated 
200,000 vehicular accidents and 10,000 traffic fatalities each year in North 
America, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 18, 1993, at 4:56 p.m., a Douglas DC-8 plowed into the ground just 
short of the runway at the U.S. Naval Air Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. That 
crew -- like the occupants of too many other cockpits, sleep experts say -- 
needed a nap, according to a report by the National Transportation Safety 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a recent report in the New York Times, all three members of a 
flight crew -- pilot, co-pilot and engineer -- will occasionally fall asleep 
while their jumbo jet flies on automatic pilot, a violation of FAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
 On one occasion, it was reported, a flight attendant assigned to keep the 
pilot awake also fell asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of lost productivity and multimillion-dollar lawsuits, more and more 
companies are beginning to see the benefits (of naps in the workplace)," says 
Marvin Miles of Stanford's Sleep Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody knows the symptoms of dangerous drowsiness: irritability, short-term 
memory loss and spontaneous loss of consciousness. Unlike most remedies, a nap 
offers immediate and complete relief. And it can be self-administered before, 
during or after symptoms appear. 
</P>
<P>
 Dement admits he personally does little napping because "my employers don't 
encourage it." 
</P>
<P>
 "So, we still have a long way to go, I guess," concedes Dement's protege Mark 
Rosekind, who conducts FAA-approved cockpit rest studies for the NASA Ames 
Research Center at Moffet Field.  
</P>
<P>
 Although crew naps are still prohibited on most airplanes, Rosekind's research 
showed that, "right stuff" or not, pilots score better on take-offs and 
landings if they are properly rested. Such research comes as no surprise to 
those in the cockpit, says Rosekind, who is promoting a new sleep education 
project for airlines and their employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "As little pockets of our society become better informed," Rosekind says, 
"good sleep hygiene will be valued just as much as a good diet and exercise 
regimen. . . . But we've got to get past casting aspersions when we see 
somebody sleeping. What we should be saying is, 'Gee, there's someone trying to 
be healthy and safe.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Esprit and Levi Strauss & Co. are in the vanguard of corporations that 
acknowledge the occasional need for employee naps. Although coffee breaks have 
long been a part of the workday, companies are finding that a nap or exercise 
break can be even more refreshing. But even though science now supports the 
boost in productivity, few companies want to be known for paying workers to 
sleep on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at those companies whose flextime allows naps, image-conscious executives 
are wary about how their unwritten rest policies may be viewed by outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 At Levi, a top vice president said no one at the corporation was interested in 
discussing the chambers where San Francisco employees can recline during 
working hours. "Myself, I've never even seen the inside of one of those rooms," 
John Onoda said. "I'm way too busy." 
</P>
<P>
 At Ben and Jerry's Vermont headquarters, where stressed workers also are 
treated to free massages, the beloved futon was reported "lost somewhere in the 
building" when a reporter inquired about getting a photograph. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many living organisms have circadian ( circa means around , dia means day ) 
clocks in their brains that regulate physiological and behavioral functions on 
a 24-hour basis. This clock regulates sleep and wake patterns, body 
temperature, hormones, performance, mood, digestion and other functions.  
</P>
<P>
 Humans are genetically programmed to sleep at certain times during the 
circadian cycle: once in the middle of the night and again in the middle of the 
afternoon. Scientists insist that the universal longing to close one's eyes at 
such times has nothing to do with warm rooms, heavy meals or even boring 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some beautiful scientific studies that show the two periods of 
maximal sleepiness are from 3 to 5 a.m. and 3 to 5 p.m. It may be what High Tea 
is all about, and why siestas are so popular near the Equator," Rosekind says.  
</P>
<P>
 In less frantic cultures, afternoon naps are nothing to be ashamed of. In many 
countries (Japan and the United States among the most notable exceptions), such 
rhythms of life are ritualized and, like the Chinese xiuxi , protected against 
Western "progress."  
</P>
<P>
 Seizing what scientists call that "trough in alertness" for a nap, researchers 
say, is probably a good idea for many workers. But it is particularly 
recommended for the one in four of us who on any given day wake up before we've 
had a sufficient night's sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornell University psychologist James Maas says most Americans sleep seven 
hours a night or less, sacrificing the crucial eighth hour of productive, 
dream-rich sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, there is "more sleepiness in more people more of the time than ever 
before," says David F. Dinges, a sleep specialist at the University of 
Pennsylvania. But until recently, no one seemed to care.  
</P>
<P>
 Until 1993, when a Congress-empaneled sleep commission issued its "National 
Sleep Alert." Like an alarm clock you can't turn off, it demanded attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Sleep deprivation, the commission warned, was costing the United States at 
least $16 billion a year. That does not include the $70 million Americans spend 
every year on over-the-counter remedies to fight fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Blame it on Thomas Edison. His discoveries turned night into day, making it 
possible to work all day and all night -- which it seems is what he wanted to 
do.  
</P>
<P>
 Ignoring all the rules for healthy sleep, Edison apparently lived on a few 
hours rest at night as well as a series of naps and micro-sleeps -- the few 
minutes or seconds of unconsciousness the brain grabs automatically to recover 
sleep lost at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what do you expect in an industrial society?" asks Wilse Webb, a 
University of Florida expert on the evolution of sleep patterns. "(Napping) is 
a sweet piece of biologically natural behavior, but it's becoming vestigial. 
Every study we've seen shows the more the world is commercialized, the less 
likely it is to value naps." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the thought of a world without naps gives Dement and other sleep 
researchers nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this moment, sleepy individuals are operating millions of motor vehicles, 
including high-tonnage trucks. They are operating trains, airplanes and ships 
of all kinds," Dement says. "They are in responsible decision-making positions: 
monitoring nuclear power plants and space missions, controlling air traffic and 
staffing strategic military installations." 
</P>
<P>
 The danger to the American public is so great, sleep researchers say, that 
they have launched a serious legislative effort to create a permanent 
government agency to monitor, even regulate, the wakefulness of the nation's 
workers.  
</P>
<P>
 A national sleep police to enforce nap time? It could be a worker's dream come 
true.

 Back when Frank Molina was a little boy with big dreams, he didn't ache to 
dribble toward the hoop like Michael Jordan or drive the long ball like any of 
those so-called Boys of Summer. 
</P>
<P>
 He wanted to kick the ball just like his hero, the former soccer great, Pele. 
That was The Dream. Nothing less would suffice. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene was a back-street barrio in his home country of El Salvador, a dusty 
field ringed by barbed wire -- where young boys would charge the grounds after 
scoring a goal, shouting, "I'm Pele! I'm Pele!" 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Molina, a player-coach for the student soccer team at Evans Community 
Adult School, might get to shake hands with some of soccer's newest idols. No, 
his team wasn't unexpectedly invited to compete in the World Cup. He'll be a 
volunteer at SoccerFest, a spinoff event to be held July 8-17 at the Los 
Angeles Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina sat spellbound last week in the Downtown school's library as Marie 
Wegerle, a SoccerFest volunteer coordinator, held up a shirt and cap 
commemorating what Molina considers to be simply the biggest sporting event on 
the planet. Wegerle was explaining to a rapt group of foreign-born students the 
fringe benefits of volunteering. 
</P>
<P>
 Several international players will attend SoccerFest, a sports fair that will 
allow kids to perform in such events as demonstrations and impromptu matches. 
The players will sign autographs for volunteers and the general public alike. 
Even the World Cup trophy will be on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 While World Cup organizers have filled countless volunteer spots for the 
much-anticipated games -- being held at nine cities nationwide, including the 
Rose Bowl in Pasadena -- there's still a chance to get involved with 
soccer-mania in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 SoccerFest organizers need more than 1,500 volunteers to work as translators, 
run errands, explain the sport of soccer, staff booths, run overhead projectors 
and give directions. 
</P>
<P>
 No major sports event -- not a Superbowl, Master's golf tournament or NBA 
final -- can be staged without the work of volunteers. With an international 
sports spectacle such as the 1994 World Cup, there's a new wrinkle in the 
search for volunteers: organizers need people who speak English and at least 
one other language. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, SoccerFest organizers have waged a billboard campaign and run 
ads in Spanish-language newspapers such as La Opinion. Across the street from 
the Evans school, a brightly colored billboard in Spanish advertised the event 
to passing motorists and students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went to every organization we could think of with people who might want to 
help," said Cynthia Burr-Larson, a volunteer coordinator for SoccerFest. "That 
meant high schools, local universities, churches -- any place where groups of 
people might have some time on their hands." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Evans school, application forms went as fast as Pele could score a goal 
off a penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I'm going to volunteer," said Molina, 23. "My hero is (Diego Armando) 
Maradona. He plays for Argentina. I don't know if he'll be there at SoccerFest. 
But I'll be looking for him." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Wegerle dangled dreams in front of these soccer fans-turned-students. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these students have just the qualities we want," said Wegerle, who has 
spoken to numerous classes at Evans as well as at high schools with large 
populations of Spanish-speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come from all over the world and can speak so many languages. And since 
they're just so crazy about soccer, they can bring that excitement to those who 
attend the event." 
</P>
<P>
 While watching a soccer videotape showing players from different countries, 
two South Korean students squealed when they spotted their country's flag. "I 
don't know how many Americans would be so excited to see their flag," Wegerle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a lot of these people, soccer represents a pride of country and 
homeland," she added. "It's that passion that drives the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Burr-Larson, who has made several appeals on local television, said operators 
have taken hundreds of calls from interested soccer fans from all walks of life 
who speak almost every language. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants include a man who advertised his "chameleon-like abilities to greet 
people in many languages and customs" and his "specialty in rap music." 
</P>
<P>
 Or consider the 10- and 11-year-old Russian soccer players who speak fluent 
Russian and Hungarian. Or the doctors and lawyers, or the professional masseuse 
who offered her services free of charge. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 At the Evans school library, Vietnamese immigrant Thanh Tieu sat on a table, 
wearing a soccer hat autographed by the entire U.S. team. Nearby, a poster 
advertising the slogan "Read" showed a young student sitting with his books in 
the grass, cradling a soccer ball with his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my country, we play soccer more than basketball," the 25-year-old student 
said. "It's an event when people play soccer. That's why I am here." 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks, those in English as a Second Language classes at the 10,000-student 
school have wondered why Americans aren't as excited about the World Cup as the 
rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students from every other country say that in their homeland, soccer is No. 
1," teacher Jane Pahr said. "That's Korea, China, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El 
Salvador, Mexico, Vietnam and Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just cannot understand why the sport is so ignored in America. I mean, 
in Latin America, two countries went to war over the sport. That's the weight 
it carries there." 
</P>
<P>
 (In 1969, 2,000 people in Honduras and El Salvador were killed in a brief 
skirmish known as the Soccer War, which was provoked by riots during a soccer 
tournament but grew out of border disputes and other conflicts between the two 
countries.) 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Lew, an ESL teacher for Chinese-language students at Evans, said it's 
not just young people who are excited about the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 80-year-old students from Taiwan and mainland China who fell in love 
with soccer in their countries and who want to be part of the World Cup scene," 
she said. "But many of them can barely speak English. It's heart-breaking to 
tell them they just don't have the language skills to volunteer." 
</P>
<P>
 Molina hopes he'll be able to ask a professional player about the art of 
goal-tending -- which he calls the most demanding job in sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal, it's so big, it's like an ocean to protect," he says. "The thing to 
do is forget about its size. That's what makes you nervous."

BODY WATCH; SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME; WHILE FACING A MYSTERIOUS ILLNESS, SHE 
HAS COME TO KNOW AND LOVE 'HER' NURSES. INDEED, SHE SAYS THESE WOMEN -- THESE 
SAINTS WHO TAKE CARE OF HER AND GOSSIP AND LAUGH WITH HER -- ARE 'A GIFT FROM 
GOD.'

By ROSEMARY BRESLIN, For nearly five years, 36-year-old Rosemary Breslin, a New 
York writer, has suffered from an immune disorder of unknown origin that causes 
an antibody to attack and destroy her red blood cells before they are released 
from the bone marrow. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as things were getting good on Y & R -- that's "The Young and the 
Restless" for the uninitiated -- I heard a commotion in the hospital corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 "How come you're here so much? Don't you got a job?" my nurse, Ann, shouted 
down the hall to someone.  
</P>
<P>
 A moment later my husband sheepishly entered the room. Jack and Victor were 
going at it on TV and I had my own personal soap opera dripping into my veins, 
but I knew Tony needed all my attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ann says I'm unemployed," Tony said, as he slumped into a chair. The sign on 
his face said: Proceed With Caution.  
</P>
<P>
 My husband is in the movie business. He is very successful and works almost 
all the time. But when the movie is over, so is his job. That's where we were 
at this moment.  
</P>
<P>
 "Um," I said. "What would you call it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, later that day my friend Perri came by. She is in the television 
business and knows how to call things by anything but their real name. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not unemployed," she told Tony. "You're on hiatus." I could actually 
see his chest swell. Self-delusion is a beautiful thing. 
</P>
<P>
 On our next trip to the hospital for my treatment, Tony's fortune had changed. 
He announced to Ann: "I won't be able to come again for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, good, you got a job," Ann exclaimed for the benefit of the full waiting 
room. "I was worried." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just because you're a saint doesn't mean you can't be a comedian. And my 
nurses are saints. I don't use this word loosely. I'm not somebody who holds 
her hand to her throat and says, "Oh, the nurses, I don't know what I'd do 
without them." We spend entirely too much time together for that. My nurses, 
who are mostly around my age, hang out with me, talk to me. Together we gossip 
about who we like and who we don't. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe those women in the fur coats took your room," Ann said when I 
arrived one day for treatment. "They just went in and put their stuff down like 
they owned the place." 
</P>
<P>
 I had to convince her it was OK that they took the room reserved for me. Ann, 
who could play defensive tackle for the Giants, had wanted to throw them out. 
She had my other nurse, Liz, so angry about the whole thing, I thought they 
were going to invite the women to step outside. 
</P>
<P>
 On another day, after my father had gone to get coffee, Liz said: "I'm worried 
about your Dad. He doesn't look good."  
</P>
<P>
 "What about me?" I said, the IV dripping into the device inserted in my chest. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, you're fine," Liz said and raced out to see if she could do anything for 
my father. 
</P>
<P>
 Other days, as they check my blood count or "access my port" -- that's 
hospital lingo for putting in my IV -- we calculate how long it's been since 
Liz had a date, how much Ann has charged on her credit cards and if Mary 
Elizabeth's baby is really as wide as he is tall. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Liz and Mary Elizabeth had a deep discussion at the side of my bed about 
someone they were unhappy with.  
</P>
<P>
 "Who? Who?" I asked. Not knowing was driving me crazy.  
</P>
<P>
 "I keep forgetting you're a patient," Mary Elizabeth said. "Just be quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If I said they were saints, I take that back. Actually, half the time I think 
they must be out of their minds because no sane person would choose to do what 
they do. 
</P>
<P>
 They are made out of something different from the rest of us. In the nearly 
five years of my mysterious illness, the nurses have been the people who 
support me, strengthen me, watch out for and over me at all times. And although 
I am only one of hundreds of people they take care of in the course of a single 
week, I am always made to feel as if I am the most important. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago, my nurse from my former doctor's office came to visit me at 
my new digs. Also named Ann, she had switched jobs from the relatively cushy 
life at the doctor's office to the hospital's new breast-cancer center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to learn more and I thought this would be a greater challenge," Ann 
said. She went on to describe with great joy a job that most people would liken 
to working in a coal mine. As Ann rose to leave, she said to me, "You really 
have to come over and see the place. It's incredible." She then caught herself. 
"On second thought, you don't want to. I'll come here." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I think I've got enough going on right now," I said, and we both 
laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Out in the hallway, my new nurses surround Ann and I heard them give her 
advice and the names of nurses they know across the street. The scene reminded 
me of one when I first started being treated here. My doctor had stopped in to 
visit me. After he left, I saw him practically pinned against the hall wall, 
and my three nurses were grilling him. About 15 minutes later, Liz came in the 
room and said: "Now we know everything we need to about you." 
</P>
<P>
 And what they did not know then, they know now. Who I am is just as important 
as what's wrong with me. They know that I'm strong and capable, that I really 
want to have a baby, that I have a most caring husband and family, that every 
once in a while I get physically and mentally depressed, which is when they 
give me extra support.  
</P>
<P>
 These women are a most important part of my life. I spend more time with them 
than anyone else. And even though we have a great time together, nothing ever 
interferes with why I'm there and how they can help me. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd say the relationship is a little one-sided, but my nurses love me as much 
as I love them. And they know that I recognize them as a gift from God. 
</P>
<P>
 On my last day of treatment before the end of Tony's "hiatus," he stopped to 
say goodby to Ann. She was crouched down, carefully explaining to a little boy 
the different chemotherapy drugs she was administering to his older brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann gave Tony a warm smile and a quick wave and then turned back to the little 
boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there anything else you want to know?" she gently asked.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it may seem like it's all fun and games. It isn't.

THE WEEK AHEAD: MINSK; ELECTIONS IN BELARUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Conservative Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich is the favorite in a field of 
six in Thursday's presidential elections in the former Soviet republic of 
Belarus.And he helped his chances earlier this month with a classic political 
stroke, slashing prices on bread, butter and meat. 
</P>
<P>
 The presidential post was created by the country's recently adopted 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Kebich, who favors slower reforms and a monetary union with Russia that would 
take away a bit of his country's independence, has used his privileges as head 
of state to make nightly television speeches to voters in the country of 10 
million.

THE WEEK AHEAD: SINGAPORE; FREEDOM FOR FAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael P. Fay, the American teen-ager who became the focus of a worldwide 
debate about crime and punishment when he was sentenced to be caned for 
vandalism, is being released from prison today. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay is being turned loose early from his four-month prison sentence because of 
good behavior.In March, he was sentenced to jail, six strokes with a rattan 
cane and a $2,230 fine after pleading guilty to spray-painting cars and other 
acts of mischief. Two months later, the Singapore government reduced the caning 
sentence to four strokes as a gesture to President Clinton, who intervened on 
Fay's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 The case continues to draw controversy. When Singapore offered to host a 
meeting of the World Trade Organization last month , U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor opposed the move and hinted strongly that his position was based 
in part in retaliation for the caning.

CULTURE; CANADIAN MOUNTIES MAY GET THEIR MAN -- BUT PROMOTERS DON'T ALWAYS GET 
IT; WRONG UNIFORMS AND WRONG IMAGE ARE BEING EXPLOITED, THE POLICE COMPLAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG TURNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a nod to the London bobby, Canada may be the only nation where a police 
officer is the national icon. 
</P>
<P>
 The image of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer is nearly ubiquitous 
here. It can be seen and purchased on T-shirts, coffee mugs, calendars, 
postcards and shot glasses. There are Mountie dolls and Mountie stuffed bears 
and Mountie key chains. Next fall, the first Canadian-produced television 
series to appear on an American network during prime time will debut. It's main 
character is a Mountie who works somewhat out of his element in Chicago, but 
who always gets his man. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, for the first time in its 121-year history, the RCMP is moving to 
aggressively protect its image from what it regards as improper exploitation, 
and perhaps cash in itself as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure that what's being displayed on the market, whether it's 
toys or souvenir items, reflects well on the force," says Chief Supt. Jacques 
Lemay, director of public affairs for the RCMP in Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, there happen to be compelling fiscal reasons for seeking new 
revenue. In the last year, budget cutting has forced downsizing of the 
headquarters force in Ottawa, consolidation of some detachments and elimination 
of the department band. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to look at new ways and innovations to pay for things. . . . We have 
to live within budget restraints." 
</P>
<P>
 Lemay is working on a twofold program in response. One involves being more 
vigilant about what the RCMP considers misrepresentations of the force. As an 
example, the Mounted Police protested a World Wrestling Federation character 
who dresses up in the characteristic red uniform and bullies his opponents with 
a fake cattle prod. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a very poor image for our young men and women to be associated 
with," Lemay says. 
</P>
<P>
 The second aspect is recruiting Canadian corporate executives for a foundation 
to raise private money for the RCMP's ceremonial, public relations and 
community policing functions. The Mounted Police Foundation, still in the 
formative stage, would act as an auxiliary group to the force. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemay envisions using this corporate brain trust as a resource on how the RCMP 
might better market itself and as a means to attract corporate donations for 
such programs as victim compensation and drug abuse prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never tried to do anything like that, but people have been telling us 
there are a lot of organizations that would love to be associated with us," 
Lemay said. " . . . The tricky part is to make sure you're very careful about 
picking who it is you work with." 
</P>
<P>
 While there have been no public announcements yet about who might serve on 
this foundation, Lemay says recruitment has been easier than he believed and 
that the process has moved along. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the RCMP can license its image, and collect fees from the 
manufacturers of all those souvenirs, may be problematic, although there are 
lawyers working on it. Canadian law forbids the commercial use of the name or 
"any pictorial representation of" the RCMP, but the statute is rarely enforced 
here, and violators in the United States and other foreign countries are beyond 
the reach of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a practical matter, "we're pretty much in the public domain now," Lemay 
concedes. 
</P>
<P>
 That's clear from a visit to the RCMP's regimental museum, on the grounds of 
its national training academy in this prairie capital. 
</P>
<P>
 On display and in the archives are hundreds of examples of the exploitation of 
the Mounties for marketing purposes. Nothing seems to be off limits. There are 
Mountie illustrations on ashtrays, pillowcases, whiskey bottles, sachets, beer 
labels and toothpaste tubes. There are commemorative plates, tins, buttons, 
peanut packs and swizzle sticks. Mickey Mouse, Garfield the cat and Barbie all 
have been dressed in RCMP uniforms for sale here and in the United States. The 
new Vancouver NBA franchise, scheduled to begin play in 1995, considered 
adopting the nickname "Mounties," but backed away. A minor league baseball team 
in Alberta already uses it, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Malcolm J.H. Wake, the genial director of the museum, good naturedly displays 
examples of this merchandising to a visitor, frowning only at the image of 
"Malcolm the Mountie," a character that peddles beer on British television. 
</P>
<P>
 "He does things no Mountie would ever do, like walk into a bar in his red 
serge (uniform) and order a beer and drink it," Wake sighs. "Knowing British 
television, he probably does other naughty things too, but I'm not sure." 
</P>
<P>
 There is an entire exhibit devoted to the RCMP and the movies. More than 250 
films have been made about the service and Hollywood being Hollywood, accuracy 
always has been a secondary concern, if any concern at all. They've been wrong 
about the uniforms, the nomenclature, the history, even the name. Hollywood's 
Mounties also are a trigger-happy lot, in marked contrast to real RCMP members, 
who rarely draw their guns. 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes a geography lesson is in order. Wake laughingly points out a 
poster of the 1954 production of "Saskatchewan," starring Alan Ladd, that 
proclaims it was filmed in the glorious Canadian Rockies. It was in fact filmed 
around Banff in Alberta province, not in Saskatchewan, which is as flat as 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
 But while RCMP officials may wince at such gaffes, there's no doubt the 
Hollywood heroism often is good for public relations. Canadian historian Pierre 
Berton notes that the phrase "they always get their man" was popularized by the 
movies, not real life. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the RCMP today offers technical advice to filmmakers. For "North of 60," a 
Canadian television series about an RCMP officer in northern Canada, the 
service even provides the uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 However, "Due South," the comedy-action television film that served as the 
pilot for the upcoming series, is drawing no smiles around RCMP headquarters. 
Lemay frostily notes that the producers declined an offer of advice and 
assistance, and the production didn't even get the uniform right, showing the 
central character wearing a badge on his hat. 
</P>
<P>
 The RCMP long has recognized the value of good public relations. It performs 
an exhibition of horsemanship called the Musical Ride around the world. And 
there are plenty of RCMP items in the museum gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to generate a love for the Mounted Police," Wake says earnestly in 
his cluttered corner office. "We want a child in trouble to know he or she can 
go to a Mountie and see him or her as a friend. So if every child in Canada can 
have a Mountie teddy bear, all the better. . . . The force has lived on its 
image for years." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1873 as the North West Mounted Police, the force is a principal 
reason why the settling of the frontier in Canada was far less violent than in 
the United States. Arriving white settlers found a peacekeeping organization 
already in place. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the popular belief is that the Mounted Police were sent in to protect 
the settlers from the wild Indians, in fact they were sent in to protect the 
Indians from the wild settlers, mainly American whiskey traders up from Montana 
selling rotgut," notes historian Berton. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a paramilitary organization charged with keeping law and order, the 
RCMP functioned on a much broader scale, Berton says, providing a variety of 
social services. "They were really civil servants, not policemen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, in addition to acting similarly to the FBI as a national police force, 
the 21,957-member RCMP provides provincial police duties in all Canadian 
provinces except Ontario and Quebec. It patrols the borders and the waterways 
and enforces drug, firearms and securities laws.  
</P>
<P>
 While the RCMP's image in the United States has been molded by movies and 
merchandising, in Canada, real life has resulted in more ambivalent feelings. 
The force has been used to break strikes and spy on civilians. Recently, as the 
RCMP has introduced more women into the ranks, there have been allegations of 
sexual harassment. "Above the Law," a new book by veteran journalist Paul 
Palango, purports to expose how investigations were compromised for political 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Polling data, however, continues to show the RCMP generally well regarded by 
most Canadians. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Canadians are generally proud of the Mounties and it lets us sneer at 
the FBI and some other agencies, saying we have something much better here than 
in the States," says Berton.

NATIONAL AGENDA; GROWING IT--AND GOING NOWHERE; RUSSIAN FARMERS' ROAD TO MARKET 
RUNS AFOUL OF CHAOTIC DISTRIBUTION AND ORGANIZED CRIMINALS.

<P>
 So fertile is the black earth in Russia's southern breadbasket that farmers 
say if you plant a shovel, the handle will sprout leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Shtukanev family farm, this makes for a lavish spread come dinner time: 
fresh chicken, potatoes, rice, bread, butter, spring dill, parsley and basil 
leaves, pickled tomatoes, eggplant, and, from the livestock, pure white sala , 
a thick hunk of salted pork fat that is considered a special delicacy here. 
</P>
<P>
 Every morsel--even the bottle of vodka brewed from local durham wheat--is 
grown by the familyon their 36-acre farm. 
</P>
<P>
 With a tractor, a harvester, few debts and higher yields than the collective 
farm he declared independence from two years ago, Vladimir G. Shtukanev, 34, is 
the very model of the entrepreneurial private farmer that Russian reformers 
envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shtukanev has one big problem: He has no buyer for the harvest bursting 
from his fields. 
</P>
<P>
 The Soviet state distribution system is moribund, and Russia has yet to 
replace it with a free market to transport, wholesale and retail food. Part of 
the problem is the endemic chaos that has plagued Russia's transition to a 
rational economic system, a situation further aggravated by runaway inflation. 
But equally to blame is the so-called Russian mafia, which has fixed food 
prices in the big cities and, with threats and violence, prevents farmers from 
selling their produce cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grave obstacles have appeared in getting food to the consumer," said Deputy 
Agriculture Minister Anatoly S. Kopylov in a recent interview. "One of the 
characteristics of this disorganized and chaotic market is its criminal 
nature." 
</P>
<P>
 The Agriculture Ministry is so concerned that it is setting up 800 regional 
wholesale food markets to link buyers and sellers in a "civilized" way, Kopylov 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Russia lurches toward a free-market economy, nowhere have the changes been 
more jolting--and more bewildering--than down on the farm, where the fields are 
bountiful but the marketing is a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 On paper, at least, the transformation from the Communist command system looks 
sweeping. Russia now has 277,000 privately owned farms that are home to 1.5 
million people and span 29 million acres of land. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 90% of the vast and notoriously inefficient collective farms have 
been turned into joint-stock companies in which workers have ownership and 
voting rights. Here in Krasnodar, more than 15% of these new agro-businesses 
have already voted to fire the old Communist Party bosses who once carried out 
Moscow's commands, said Gennady G. Koltsev, the region's deputy administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the director loses the trust of his members, no local officials can save 
him," Koltsev said. As the economic crunch deepens, some farms have ousted two 
directors in three months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the 60-year legacy of collectivization cannot be dissolved by decree. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone is what leading Russian land reformer Yuri D. Chernichenko calls the 
"agro-gulag," a system that kept collective farm workers from leaving their 
farms without permission and doomed them to decades of substandard housing, 
health and education. 
</P>
<P>
 But a host of complex, interrelated economic, organizational and psychological 
changes are needed before rural Russians can take advantage of their 
theoretical new freedoms: 
</P>
<P>
 * First, the 213% annual interest rate makes it impossible for most would-be 
private farmers to buy the equipment, fertilizer and seed needed to get 
started. Many who have borrowed money have simply gone broke. In 1993, 15,000 
private farms went bankrupt, and the failure rate is accelerating, according to 
the Assn. of Russian Peasant Farms and Agricultural Cooperatives, or AKKOR. 
</P>
<P>
 In Krasnodar, a number of former collective farms are also insolvent, but so 
far local authorities--fearful that bankruptcy would mean unemployment for 
hundreds, if not thousands, ofworkers--have managed to bail them out. 
</P>
<P>
 * Second, the decision to free energy prices has created a severe oil shock in 
the farm belt. As once-subsidized energy prices approach world levels, farmers 
suddenly can no longer afford to fuel their diesel-guzzling tractors, sowers 
and harvesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor can they afford to purchase the cheap, petroleum-based fertilizers, 
herbicides and pesticides that they once lavished on their land. By early 
March, farms had only a third of the required fertilizer and half the 
pesticides needed to defend this year's crop, according to government 
statistics. Environmentalists say this reduced use of chemicals is a blessing 
in disguise. But a meager harvest is nonetheless predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 * Third, prices for farm commodities are rising far more slowly than prices 
for industrial goods, a process that is fast eroding farmers' purchasing power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fuel prices are rising, but our prices are not," complained private farmer 
Vladimir O. Melnik, who along with 22 others formed a marketing cooperative in 
the Krymsk region of western Krasnodar. 
</P>
<P>
 A liter of diesel fuel costs 10 times what it did last year, Melnik said, but 
the price of a pound of potatoes has not even doubled. In 1992, a Krasnodar 
farmer could earn enough from selling 30 tons of tomatoes to buy two tractors, 
he said; today, those tomatoes would cover only half the price of one tractor. 
</P>
<P>
 But what farmers complain of most bitterly is the lack of a safe, predictable 
market for their food. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is scary, but despite the fact that the markets are empty, it's 
still impossible to sell your produce" in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other 
large Russian cities, said Tatyana V. Vasilyeva, president of the local 
Krasnodar branch of AKKOR, which represents 16,680 private farmers. Highway 
robbers, traffic police who demand payola in exchange for free passage and 
payoffs to local gangsters make a mockery of a free market, she explained. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vasilyeva told of farmers who drove a truck full of top-quality smoked ham to 
Moscow and tried to sell it for about $1.10 a pound--less than half the going 
rate in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Shops would only take the ham on consignment, with the money to be paid weeks 
or months later--once inflation has eroded its value. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the market, our farmers nearly got killed. The mafia would not allow them 
to sell it there," Vasilyeva said, using the term mafia to mean anything from 
petty extortionists who rough up street merchants to the professional criminals 
known to enforce their demands with heavy firepower. 
</P>
<P>
 In desperation, the farmers drove their truck to the AKKOR headquarters in 
Moscow to ask for help--and sold their ham on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "This ham was literally snapped up in a couple of minutes," Vasilyeva said. 
"People were buying as much as they could carry, because the price was 
ridiculously low. Still, none of the stores would take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Melnik, the Krasnodar farmer, said his cooperative sent a truck of tomatoes to 
Moscow, but the farmers were stopped at the outskirts of the city, where 
racketeers together with corrupt traffic police insisted that the contents of 
the truck be handed over at rock-bottom prices. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If you do get through, they tell you what price you can sell for, and no 
lower," Melnik said. The complaints of beatings, threats and price-fixing have 
been repeated by farmers from Siberia to central Russia. So was Melnik's 
conclusion: "It's just not worth going to Moscow."  
</P>
<P>
 Russian Interior Minister Viktor F. Yerin said such problems are exaggerated. 
At a news conference this month, Yerin said police have cracked down on highway 
banditry, arresting about a dozen gangs of truck hijackers in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 But the minister also complained of the farmers' own passivity. Police have 
offered to organize protected truck convoys but have not had any takers, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the residents of Krasnodar have little faith in their government. 
Last fall, the quasi-official state grain agency collected the autumn harvest 
from farmers--but did not pay some of them until April. By the time farmers and 
collectives got the money, inflation had reduced it to a joke. And many were 
left without the means to buy seeds and fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 The pro-Communist Agrarian Union and its allies immediately began predicting a 
disastrous harvest unless the government stopped slashing subsidies to 
agriculture. After a fierce lobbying campaign, Prime Minister Viktor S. 
Chernomyrdin released about $2.6 billion to help get the spring crop planted. 
</P>
<P>
 Come autumn, however, farmers will be anxious to find a grain buyer more 
reliable than the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some growers may be scared off," said Deputy Agriculture Minister Kopylov. 
"That is why we are in a hurry to create a new and independent system" of 
regional wholesale markets, grain exchanges and even a futures market that will 
help create a more predictable market for grain. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, private farmers and privatized collectives are quite 
literally living off their land. Barter is now more common than cash 
transactions. Farmers say they have swapped their produce for everything from 
TV sets to fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers speak with nostalgia of how much easier life was 10 years ago. While 
few say they would return to the unfulfilled promise of utopia under the Soviet 
system, nearly everyone is dismayed by the chaos that surrounds them. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Path to Communism collective farm was turned into a joint-stock 
company last year, its 2,500 workers quickly renamed it "Niva," meaning field. 
</P>
<P>
 "That (communism) was a society that couldn't exist, but we were supposedly 
heading for it," said Vladimir A. Maluga, 36, who said he no longer believes in 
utopia. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, the farm that was once considered the best collective in Krasnodar 
is $13,000 in the red. Niva now earns cash by selling Turkish delight, a 
sunflower seed and sugar confection, in the local market. The farm has also 
swapped the sweet stuff for a load of construction materials and bartered its 
fruit for diesel fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, farm workers, who had not been paid for months, were 
talking of taking their shares in Niva and splitting off as a private farm, 
Maluga said. Suddenly, the farm directors doubled their salaries, and their pay 
began to come regularly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But workers too are being held accountable for the results of their labor. 
When 12 calves died this winter, Niva's director fined Maluga and three other 
supervisors almost twice their monthly salaries for having failed to quarantine 
the sick animals before the epidemic spread. Five of Maluga's workers were 
sacked for showing up late, drunk or not at all. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the harsh measures, Maluga said he would vote to keep Niva's director 
in office. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a little cruel . . . but he's an honest man," the farmer said. He 
paused, then added approvingly: "And he knows how to count." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Niva company is learning what not to plant. For decades, 
central planners in Moscow ordered the collective to grow hemp--but the 
free-market price turned out to be too low to make the crop worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Niva is planting soybeans for cattle feed. And the farm is 
abandoning the old Soviet practice of fattening cattle on once-subsidized but 
now-expensive grain. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Russian grain market so unstable, farmer Shtukanev has planted half 
his land with sunflowers. If the local plant that produces sunflower oil buys 
his seeds at a decent price, Shtukanev believes that he can pay off his debts 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing it is a lot easier than selling it," Shtukanev said. "You have to 
figure out how you're going to sell your crops before you plant them. That's 
the hardest part." A Bite Out of the Breadbasket 
</P>
<P>
 Food prices are skyrocketing in Russia, but farmers aren't reaping the wealth. 
Middlemen skim off the profits while consumers and farmers suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Average Russian monthly salary, as of April: $94.59 (175,000 rubles) 
</P>

THE WEEK AHEAD: BRUSSELS; NATO TIE FOR MOSCOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ending one of the more off-again-on-again affairs in recent diplomatic memory, 
Moscow is expected Wednesday to end months of indecision and finally enter into 
its first formal relationship with NATO -- the Western military alliance 
created 45 years ago to halt Soviet expansionism. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev is scheduled to commit his country 
to cooperate with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization by signing up in 
Brussels for Partnership for Peace, a Clinton Administration initiative 
designed to encourage closer military coordination across the old Cold War 
divide. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Soviet Bloc successor states have already joined the program, but Moscow 
held out for special status.

THE WEEK AHEAD: CORFU; EU SEEKS PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leaders of the 12 European Union nations convene on this Greek island Thursday 
and Friday to choose a successor to Jacques Delors as president of the EU's 
powerful executive commission.There is already talk of a possible deadlock at 
the meeting, the EU's semiannual summit. 
</P>
<P>
 Delors' second five-year term expires at the end of the year, so if no 
successor is chosen at Corfu a special summit may be required in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin will come to Corfu to sign a 
trade agreement with the European Union. The accord is considered an important 
link binding Russia with the West.

 Wojciech Garlej, a 24-year-old driver, is standing patiently in line to pay 
for something that should be the birthright of anyone living in a European 
capital at the end of the 20th Century: clean drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
 "The water that's for free in the taps is not fit for drinking, it's so 
polluted. It's simply dirty and has a funny smell," says Garlej after buying 10 
liters (2.6 gallons) of specially treated well water.  
</P>
<P>
 Like Garlej, hundreds of Warsaw residents head every day to a small building 
in the city's ritzy Mokotow district to fill canisters with water that meets 
the highest purity standards. They pay 300 zlotys -- or 1.3 cents -- for each 
liter (about a quart). 
</P>
<P>
 Even that tiny sum mounts up for 70-year-old pensioner Halina Fondalinska, who 
purchases five liters every other day. She resents paying for water but says 
"what you get through the pipes doesn't even classify as water. When you make 
tea with this well water, it's really tea."  
</P>
<P>
 Bad drinking water is only one of the many penalties Poles are still paying 
for 45 years of environmental damage done by the negligent Communist system. 
</P>
<P>
 A report prepared by the Polish Environment Ministry for the United Nations 
concedes that Poland's air pollution is among the worst in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1987 and 1989, for example, Poland was responsible for 10% of the 
total emissions of sulfur dioxide -- a key ingredient of acid rain -- on the 
Continent. Much of the blame falls on use of brown coal for home heating and 
electricity generation. Over 80% of the forests in Poland have been damaged by 
acid rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Within Poland there are some particularly black holes. Heavily industrial 
Katowice province, in southern Poland, which represents only 2.1% of the 
country's territory, emits 20% to 25% of its sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and 
dust. The Katowice region is considered the most polluted in Europe.  
</P>
<P>
 Air and water contamination are so serious in nearby Krakow that pregnant 
women are often advised by their doctors to leave the city during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 As for water, the Environment Ministry report called the quality of surface 
water in the country "tragic." Like visitors to a Third World country, 
foreigners in the Polish capital are warned by locals not to drink from the 
tap. Not that anyone would be tempted by what comes out of the spigot. It 
emerges in hues ranging from pale yellow to deep rust. In some neighborhoods, 
it reeks of chlorine. 
</P>
<P>
 The people who operate Warsaw's water treatment plants argue that they bring 
the water up to World Health Organization standards or better before sending it 
out to homes and factories. But by the time it's traveled through antiquated 
pipes, bacteria, excessive iron and other dangerous chemicals may be swept 
along. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although the water meets the standards, unfortunately the smell and taste of 
it is not too good," admits Bozena Mistag, director of the water-quality 
laboratory at Warsaw's Northern Water Treatment Plant. 
</P>
<P>
 A major problem is the raw material the water treatment plants receive. Only 
4% of Poland's rivers and lakes contain water clean enough to drink even after 
boiling. A third of the country's rivers are so polluted that their waters 
cannot even be used for industrial purposes because they corrode metal. Water 
from two-thirds of residential wells in Polish villages is undrinkable.  
</P>
<P>
 The Vistula River, from which Warsaw gets much of its drinking water, often 
fails to meet even the lowest standards of water for any use -- never mind 
drinking. And for consumers downstream, it's even worse. Warsaw is the only 
European capital other than Albania's Tirana to dump raw sewage into its main 
river. 
</P>
<P>
 As a consequence, Poland is the worst contributor -- among 14 countries -- to 
Baltic Sea pollution. It bears the dubious distinction of having 38 identified 
"hot spots" where factories and towns pour pollutants into rivers that empty 
into the Baltic. 
</P>
<P>
 Polish authorities estimate that they need $6.4 billion to clean up the 
country's contribution to Baltic pollution -- money the government does not 
have. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Warsaw's Northern Water Treatment Plant, manager Jan Grzymkowski points out 
the disgusting murky gray-brown color of the water taken in from Zegrzenski 
Lake -- not far from the spot where numerous villages and small towns dump 
their raw sewage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main problem is to get rid of the color of the water and the high amount 
of organic substances in the water," he says. The water is treated with ozone, 
one of the most modern methods available. Still, that's no guarantee of 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quality of the water when it leaves our plant is much higher than when it 
reaches your home," Grzymkowski admits. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one reason so many Warsaw residents head for wells that deliver water 
that was trapped in rocks in the Oligocene period. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the Health Ministry warns that even water from these Oligocene 
wells can be dangerous. Of 50 such wells in the Polish capital, 23 were found 
to be polluted; several have been closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the grim picture, Alicija Lopatek, head of environmental hygiene for 
the Health Ministry, insists that Polish tap water, although unappetizing to 
the eye, "doesn't endanger health." 
</P>
<P>
 But many residents think otherwise. Ecology activist Barbara Kitta-Gajkowska 
says her chronic stomach problems disappeared two years ago when she stopped 
using tap water.  
</P>
<P>
 Grzymkowski says: "The only solution is for the government to force factories 
and towns to build sewage treatment plants so they don't dump raw sewage into 
the rivers we have to drink from."

CULTURE; SOUTH KOREAN WOMEN STRIDE TOWARD EQUALITY; IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, THE 
NATION'S STAUNCHLY CONSERVATIVE CONFUCIAN SOCIETY HAS BEGUN TO BEND TO THE 
DEMANDS OF A MODERN WORLD. 
</P>

 Just five years ago, a South Korean woman struggling against a determined 
rapist bit off part of her assailant's tongue. She was convicted of assault for 
using "excessive force." 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, a Korean widow was not entitled to her husband's estate. Under 
family law, it went to the eldest son because only men could be heads of 
households. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea is arguably the most Confucian of all Asian nations, where "men 
are heaven; women are earth." Traditional teachings admonish women to obey 
their fathers, husbands and sons throughout life. 
</P>
<P>
 So when a Seoul National University professor repeatedly embraced his office 
assistant and fired her when she resisted, the woman did not think to complain. 
It took Choi Eun Soon, a young attorney representing the new breed of South 
Korean women, to view it as something that had never before been brought before 
the courts here: sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 And in an April decision that stunned the nation, a Seoul judge ruled against 
the professor. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Park Chang Wu awarded Choi's 26-year-old client, identified only as Wu, 
$34,000 in compensation, a remarkable judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision has provoked furious debate -- as well as angry phone calls to 
Choi and Park -- over an offense most Koreans regard as "common practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Surveys show nearly 90% of Korean women say they have been sexually harassed, 
compared to about one-third of American women.

 "It is a historic moment for Korean women," Choi said. "Before, women thought 
that as long as they didn't lose their chastity over the harassment, it was OK. 
But now they consider it a violation of their human dignity, and that's a big 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 Choi and other women here avidly followed sexual harassment cases in the 
United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "When even President Clinton has problems," Seoul professor Kim Ok Ryol said 
with a laugh, "it raises the awareness of sexual harassment here." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Korean men also seem to be taking the ruling seriously -- from trepidation if 
nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ruling has helped create a new phrase on everybody's lips: 'Be careful, 
gentlemen. Do you have ($34,000)?' " said Park Moo Jong, a journalist who 
recently wrote a piece headlined "Male-Oriented Culture Disintegrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Park's prognosis may be premature. But in the last few years, even this 
staunchly conservative Confucian society has begun to bend to the demands of a 
modern world. 
</P>
<P>
 Women are building the legal foundation with laws in such significant areas as 
family inheritance, a battleground for nearly 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, women became eligible to become household heads and win a share of 
inheritances based on how much they contributed to caring for parents and 
building the family's assets. 
</P>
<P>
 This April, a new national law on sexual violence was enacted that toughens 
provisions on rape and incest and criminalizes obscene phone calls and fondling 
in crowded places. The law also provides funding for a sexual violence 
counseling center. 
</P>
<P>
 The successful drive for the law was fueled in part by embarrassing Interpol 
statistics showing South Korea had one of the highest rape rates in the world, 
said Noh Joo Hi of the Sexual Violence Counseling Center. In addition, South 
Korea's newly democratic politics, which succeeded three decades of military 
authoritarianism, suddenly made the women's vote count. 
</P>
<P>
 In the working world, Korean women are following the pattern of advanced 
nations by increasing their education levels, delaying marriage and taking 
white-collar jobs instead of traditional farm work. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the board, they are beginning to successfully challenge discrimination 
in job recruitment, duties and promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 An equal employment law was adopted several years ago but had little 
enforcement teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years, women have persuaded courts to strike down requirements 
not germane to the job, such as having a military record, or such rules as 
mandatory retirement at age 35 for female telephone operators. A six-year 
struggle recently resulted in the abolition of a banking code that restricted 
women to low-paying teller and clerical jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The pay gap between women and men, long the widest among all nations surveyed 
by the International Labor Organization, is slowly closing -- the women's share 
grew from 52.7% of men's wages in 1991 to 57% in 1993, according to Kim, a 
women's studies professor at Sookmyung Women's University. College graduates 
earned 73% the level of their male counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we have the legal basis on which to fight, and women are beginning to 
awaken to pursue their own rights," said Park Young Sook, a longtime women's 
activist and former Democratic Party legislator. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The changing social environment is also felling entrenched taboos, such as 
public debate on the prevalent practice of wife-beating. Spousal abuse was long 
ignored as a private family matter -- a traditional Korean saying advises men 
to beat their wives like dried fish to soften them. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the problem is dissected on talk shows, publicized in photo exhibits and 
protested at rallies. 
</P>
<P>
 New images of Korean women are turning up on television and in textbooks. The 
single and savvy designer in the popular drama "Missing You" offers an 
alternative role model to the "good wife, wise mother" image that has dominated 
the media, women activists say. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, all melodramas were love themes with domineering men and crying 
women," said Kim, a Sookmyung women's studies professor. "Textbooks depicted 
men as courageous leaders and women as obedient followers." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Ae Young and Chung Seung Eun reflect the changing mentality of Korean 
women. Young is a 21-year-old political science student who grew up serving 
meals to her brothers and father. Throughout her life, she was told: "If you 
don't marry, you will be regarded as a defective product." 
</P>
<P>
 But, explaining her goals as she sold red peppers on campus to support the 
nation's farmers, the feisty senior said she intends to pursue not a mate but a 
journalism career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think marriage is a must, and more and more girls are thinking my 
way," she said. "I want to make journalism a lifetime job." 
</P>
<P>
 Chung, a 33-year-old hotel employee, has also seen her own attitudes change 
over time. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, she said, she assumed she would quit her job when she married. 
Not any more. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I just stayed at home, I feel I would go backward," she explained. 
"Self-accomplishment and financial independence are most important to me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the workplace is the most powerful shaper of new attitudes among women, 
giving them a taste for independence and self-fulfillment, it is still far from 
equitable, women here say. 
</P>
<P>
 When Chung, for instance, was hired by an airline for her first job, she was 
paid $40 a month less than her male counterparts. It took her five years to 
become eligible for a promotion, compared to three years for men. And some jobs 
were off-limits to women. They could not become pilots, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 She faces no discrimination in her current job -- one reason she loves it, 
Chung said. 
</P>
<P>
 Namju Cho, a journalist, said she was struck by the paucity of powerful female 
role models in South Korea after dealing with women Cabinet members, 
politicians and news editors while living in Venezuela and the United States. 
"I could really see how far behind Korea was," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Park, the former legislator, said women are the furthest behind in the 
political arena. Although President Kim Young Sam appointed three women Cabinet 
members -- now down to two -- only three of 299 National Assembly members are 
women. In the 1991 local elections, 40 women won -- a success rate of 0.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Women used to do better, but their performance worsened after South Korea 
shifted from multi-seat districts, where several candidates are elected, to 
single-seat districts. Lacking a political base and the ability to raise money, 
the women invariably run second. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic Party recently pledged to run a slate of 20% women candidates 
for its multi-seat districts, a move that could improve their showing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have a long way to go," Park said. "But under the social atmosphere 
now, no man can discriminate against women and get away with it. They should be 
prepared for retaliation."

MEDIA; HONG KONG'S PRESS FEELS CHINESE CHILL; A LOCAL REPORTER RECENTLY 
RECEIVED A 12-YEAR PRISON TERM ON THE MAINLAND FOR ALLEGEDLY STEALING STATE 
SECRETS. IN TURN, MANY OF HIS COLLEAGUES HAVE MUTED THEIR CRITICISM OF BEIJING.

<P>
 The clock is ticking toward the 1997 hand-over of Hong Kong to China, and 
Johnny Lau is determined not to fall victim a second time to Beijing's 
influence over the British colony's press corps. 
</P>
<P>
 Lau, 40, was a Beijing correspondent for Wen Wei Po, a pro-China 
Chinese-language daily in Hong Kong, before falling out with the newspaper when 
he strayed from the Communist Party line in covering the 1989 Tian An Men 
Square pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he is the deputy editor in chief of Contemporary, a Hong Kong-based 
China-watching magazine that he set up with some of his former Wen Wei Po 
colleagues. The monthly magazineprovides a glimpse through the veil of secrecy 
still shrouding the inner workings of China. It also routinely prints the type 
of sensitive information that recently earned a Hong Kong-based reporter 
working in China a 12-year prison term for allegedly stealing state secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear is perhaps the most crippling result of this chilling message from 
Beijing, and many within the ranks of Hong Kong's press hierarchy are bending 
under pressure from China. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case has cast a shadow over our work," Lau said. "This is a Chinese 
government tactic to stop the Hong Kong press from doing anything that would 
offend them." 
</P>
<P>
 The jailed journalist is Xi Yang, a Chinese citizen who reports for Hong 
Kong's mainstream Chinese-language daily Ming Pao. He was jailed in March on 
vague charges that he stole sensitive information concerning Beijing's plans 
for interest rate changes and international gold transactions. Tian Ye, an 
official at the People's Bank of China and Xi's co-defendant, was sentenced to 
15 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Lau said a verbal directive was allegedly given by the Chinese government to 
some of Hong Kong's pro-China newspaper editors and reporters advising them not 
to talk about this case or to sign any petition in support of Xi. In May, 
Beijing temporarily banned 10 Hong Kong reporters from entering China. They all 
had signed a letter of protest to the Chinese government over Xi's jailing. 
</P>
<P>
 (Pro-China reporters refused to be interviewed for this story.)  
</P>
<P>
 "These pro-China reporters . . . don't want to endanger themselves by 
releasing any information about Xi Yang," Lau said. "Most of them share the 
same feelings as other Hong Kong reporters and are sympathetic to Xi." 
</P>
<P>
 The heavy sentences appear calculated to remind Hong Kong reporters of the 
risks involved when reporting in China today and of their vulnerability after 
the colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in three years. But the head of the 
propaganda department of the Hong Kong branch of the New China News Agency, 
China's de facto consulate here, denies there is a crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question of (China) trying to tighten or limit reporting 
activities in the (Chinese) mainland," said Sun Nansheng. "I feel that a 
consensus is necessary; when we talk about press freedom, it should be 
discussed under the proposition of abiding by the laws of the (Chinese) 
mainland." 
</P>
<P>
 But Xi's case raises the questions of how China defines "state secrets" and of 
what constitute its rules governing news gathering in China. Currently, Hong 
Kong reporters have to apply for official permission to report in China and 
have to specify what events they want to cover. 
</P>
<P>
 "I now worry over whether the Chinese government will continue to allow me to 
go to China to do my reporting," said Jerry To, a 31-year-old China-beat 
reporter for Ming Pao. "And when they do allow me into China, I will worry that 
someone will be following me when I contact my sources and that the telephone 
in my hotel room will be bugged." 
</P>
<P>
 China's techniques may sound as if they belong in a spy film, yet such methods 
may be intentionally heavy-handed in order to intimidate the Hong Kong press. 
And as the 1997 deadline approaches, publishers, editors and reporters alike 
are making adjustments for the new regime. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the intimidation usually stops when reporters are back in the colony. 
But officials from the New China News Agency's Hong Kong branch are watching, 
and they routinely let the colony's reporters and editors know when they don't 
approve of their coverage of the Chinese mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Xinhua (New China News Agency) official I know quite well, who has since 
left the agency, once took me aside at (an agency-hosted) dinner and told me 
that I should be more careful" when writing about China, said Briton Danny 
Gittings, 28, a political editor and columnist for the Sunday edition of Hong 
Kong's English-language South China Morning Post newspaper. "I was a bit taken 
aback, but I don't feel threatened because the worst that can happen to me is 
that I'll be kicked out of Hong Kong in three years' time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many members of Hong Kong's press, however, lack the security of a foreign 
passport, and those who don't want to risk sharing Xi's fate may tone down 
their coverage of China. 
</P>
<P>
 "The immediate impact of Xi Yang's case is that there will be less reporting 
on China," said Daisy Li, assignment editor for Ming Pao and head of the Hong 
Kong Journalists Assn. "Clearly, it's a kind of self-censorship but not without 
the fear." 
</P>
<P>
 Observers say the Hong Kong Standard, one of three English-language newspapers 
here, is taking a less critical attitude toward China following a visit to 
Beijing in late 1992 by the paper's chairman. The Sing Tao group, which 
publishes the Hong Kong Standard and two Chinese-language newspapers, has 
committed millions of dollars to business ventures in China, including a 50-50 
joint-venture agreement with Beijing's Chinese-language People's Daily to 
publish a color magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sing Tao group was one of the first publishers to have joint-venture 
interests with China, so everyone thinks it will be subjected to heavy 
influence by the Chinese government because of its proprietary connections with 
the (Chinese) mainland," said a knowledgeable source. 
</P>
<P>
 Ming Pao's To said his close friends are trying to persuade him to leave 
journalism and enter a less risky profession. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as I'm a reporter here, I have to bear the risks that go with doing 
my job," he said. "But I have some concerns because I want to be around to take 
care of my parents, who are getting old." 
</P>
<P>
 Gittings said he'd like to stay on after 1997 but feels he may be pushed aside 
to make room for a Hong Kong Chinese who speaks Mandarin, China's official 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 And Lau vows to stay on and keep publishing. "We are helping to shape a new 
China," he said. "There will be ups and downs along the way, but China cannot 
close its door anymore."

POSTSCRIPT; A NEW THEORY ON '84 BOMB MYSTERY; ARGENTINE MERCENARY LINKED TO 
SANDINISTAS IS SUSPECTED IN ATTACK ON CONTRA LEADER'S NEWS CONFERENCE 10 YEARS 
AGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten years ago, a group of Costa Rican and American journalists ventured into 
the night, bound for a secret rendezvous with guerrilla leader Eden Pastora. 
</P>
<P>
 As the news conference began in a jungle hide-out in southern Nicaragua, a 
bomb intended for Pastora shattered the room, killing an American journalist, 
two Costa Rican colleagues and a number of Pastora's aides. Pastora, the fabled 
Comandante Zero of the revolution that ousted Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio 
Somoza, was gravely wounded but survived. 
</P>
<P>
 The bombing at La Penca became one of the most notorious and mysterious 
incidents of the long war between Nicaragua's Sandinista regime and U.S.-backed 
Contra rebels, who by that time included Pastora. Suspects were plentiful but 
evidence scant. Most accusers blamed the CIA, and the Costa Rican government 
indicted two CIA operatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a decade later, a new explanation has emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 A Costa Rican congressional commission, concluding a 3 1/2-year-long 
investigation, blamed the bombing on an Argentine terrorist who operated in 
Nicaragua under the 1979-1990 Sandinista regime. The orders to assassinate 
Pastora came from deep within the Sandinista Interior Ministry, said Sonia 
Rodriguez, president of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attack at La Penca is the maximum revelation of the desire to eliminate 
Eden Pastora, and although there existed other groups that considered Pastora 
an obstacle to their interests, it is clear that the person who executed the 
act was intimately tied to a section of the Sandinista Front government," the 
commission said in a 200-page report. 
</P>
<P>
 Some pieces of the La Penca puzzle were known within days of the May 30, 1984, 
explosion. The bomb had been placed inside a camera bag and smuggled into the 
news conference by a man posing as a Danish journalist named Per Anker Hansen. 
The last television footage taken by a Costa Rican cameraman who was killed in 
the explosion, Jorge Quiros, showed "Hansen" sneaking out of the hut where the 
news conference was taking place seconds before the bomb was triggered by 
remote control. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen feigned injuries himself and then vanished after he and 20 badly 
injured journalists were evacuated from the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 During the years that followed, survivors, journalists and other investigators 
chased down numerous leads in a quest to find out who Hansen was and who he was 
working for. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastora, the flamboyant guerrilla fighter, had plenty of enemies to choose 
from. He had betrayed his Sandinista comrades. He spooked the CIA, which 
considered him unreliable. He resisted the U.S. government's grand scheme of 
uniting Pastora's rebel front in southern Nicaragua with Contras in the north. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But all efforts to close this chapter of dirty tricks failed. Finally, new 
information emerged that pointed investigators in the direction of the 
Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
 Using recently discovered fingerprints, the Costa Rican commission identified 
the bomber as Vital Roberto Ganguine, a member of the leftist Argentine 
People's Revolutionary Army, which allied with the Sandinistas in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Ganguine, along with other revolutionaries from all over Latin America, worked 
for a shadowy intelligence and espionage unit within the Sandinista Interior 
Ministry. Investigators matched a fingerprint from official Argentine records 
with those on Hansen's immigration documents for Panama to prove that Hansen 
was Ganguine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costa Rican investigation largely confirmed the results of a multinational 
probe conducted last year by the Miami Herald and a group of Argentine 
journalists and U.S. free-lance reporter Douglas Vaughan, who is credited with 
turning up the Panamanian immigration documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan at one time worked as an investigator for the Christic Institute in 
its $23-million lawsuit that accused 28 Contras, CIA operatives and others of 
conspiracy in the La Penca bombing. The plaintiffs were Tony Avirgan, a 
television cameraman who was wounded in the bombing, and his wife, Martha 
Honey, for whom proving CIA involvement became a crusade in the years after the 
bombing. A federal judge threw out the suit in 1988, saying it was frivolous, 
and ordered the plaintiffs to pay court fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Costa Rican commission and the Herald reported that Ganguine was said 
to have been killed in a 1989 Argentine guerrilla attack on the La Tablada army 
barracks near Buenos Aires. But the Costa Rican investigators said Ganguine's 
body was never identified, and an arrest order remains in effect in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sandinista Front, which governed Nicaragua from its overthrow of Somoza in 
1979 until its upset loss in 1990 presidential elections, denied the reports 
that it was involved in the La Penca bombing. Otherwise, the news surprisingly 
has had little impact in Managua -- in part because Pastora's profile has been 
eclipsed by time, and partly because the Sandinista Front is caught up in more 
immediate crises and more recent scandals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's just old news," a diplomat in Managua said. "Eden Pastora isn't 
that important anymore. The judgment now is what dirt can you get on your 
enemies today." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the survivors whose lives were shattered 10 years ago, there is mixed 
reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 In her new book, "Hostile Acts: U.S. Policy in Costa Rica in the 1980s," Honey 
indicates that she and Avirgan believe the bomber was Ganguine. They 
investigated the new information themselves and were able to place "Hansen" in 
Sandinista Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the other survivors remain convinced of CIA involvement. They 
argue that if the Sandinistas were responsible, the U.S. government, eager 
throughout the 1980s to publicize any and all negative news on the leftist 
Nicaraguan regime, would have made sure the story got out before now. Since 
that didn't happen, these survivors conclude, Ganguine was not the man.

ETHNIC DISCORD; SIKHS RESTORE SHRINE, MILITANCY; RITUAL DAGGERS ARE TRADED FOR 
FINE-TIPPED PAINTBRUSHES AS ARTISANS PERCH ON RICKETY SCAFFOLDS WORKING ON THE 
THRONE OF THE ALMIGHTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the dimly lit interior of a shrine sacred to the world's 18 million Sikhs, 
a trio of men wearing tightly bound turbans sit on a rickety wooden scaffold, 
their faces grazing the ornately sculpted ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 The rites of the faith require every Sikh male, all of whom ritually take the 
name "Singh," or lion, to carry a dagger. But these men helping restore the 
building called the Akal Takht, or Throne of the Almighty, wield only 
fine-tipped paintbrushes. 
</P>
<P>
 With gentle delicacy and a precision worthy of an illustrated text on botany, 
they are turning the chamber's ceiling into a richly hued garden of flowers. It 
will take no less than year to finish the job in the room that measures only 10 
feet by 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, on June 5-6, 1984, the place where these artisans are now 
quietly at work was a furious battleground as Indian army commandos and tanks 
assaulted the holiest shrine in Sikhdom, the Golden Temple, in this city 15 
miles from the Pakistani border. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 500 Sikhs and 83 Indian soldiers were killed as the army pounded and 
overran the fortified complex defended by fundamentalist leader Jarnail Singh 
Bhindranwale and his heavily armed followers. 
</P>
<P>
 Their headquarters was the golden-domed Akal Takht, symbol and seat of 
Sikhism's temporal power and home to swords and other relics that belonged to 
its gurus. From the building's basement, when his followers were slain or 
subdued, Indian soldiers carried out the dead Bhindranwale's body. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For believers of what is often called the youngest of the world's great 
religions, the Indian army's assault, code-named "Operation Blue Star," was a 
heinous example of defilement. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade has now gone by, and most of the shell holes, bullet marks, broken 
marble and other wreckage left by the firefight have been repaired. Today, the 
Golden Temple complex, which its leaders claim suffered more than $300 million 
in damage, is 90% restored, said Gurbachan Singh, the assistant information 
officer at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 In the rebuilding of the religious center at Amritsar, whose gleaming shrine 
stands in a pool of greenish-brown water (called amrit , or nectar, and 
believed to have healing properties), it is tempting to see an analogy in 
marble and gold leaf for the reconciliation of Sikhs with India's authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality, though, is more complex. Removing his shoes to enter the Golden 
Temple, the barefoot visitor may ascend to the Central Sikh Museum, on the 
second floor by the northern gate. There, a visual cram course awaits in the 
events that form the Sikh consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Room after room of oil paintings graphically show how, over the centuries, 
those who followed the preachings of the 10 Sikh gurus, or teachers, were 
broken on the wheel, scalped, beheaded, burned with kerosene or on a griddle, 
boiled, crushed by trains and hanged or shot by the British army and Indian 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 For the typical Indian, Blue Star remains an operation in which armed force 
was used to suppress a small band of Sikhs using the Golden Temple as a base 
from which to commit murder, torture and extortion and defy the government. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eyes of many Sikhs, however, it was an outrage and modern update of a 
time-worn, tragic theme: the victimization of Sikhs by the majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the calculated move of Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi, military 
troops stormed the Golden Temple with tanks," reads a notice under the Central 
Sikh Museum's lurid picture of the gutted, shell-pitted Akal Takht. "The Sikhs, 
however, soon had their vengeance." 
</P>
<P>
 Beant Singh and Satwant Singh, the assassins of Mrs. Gandhi, still have places 
of honor in the museum's portrait gallery. The Sikh bodyguards who, on Oct. 31, 
1984, gunned down the woman they were supposed to protect are remembered not as 
murderers, but avengers. 
</P>
<P>
 A ruthless government campaign against militant Sikh separatism, which appears 
to be all but eradicated, has also kept suspicions and rancor smoldering. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sikhs have started to feel that their traditions, the Sikh culture and 
way of life are in danger," asserted Manjit Singh, 42, a thin, bespectacled 
professor who, since February, 1993, has served as acting jathedar of the Akal 
Takht, or head of Sikhism. "To suppress the active resistance and democratic 
political struggle of the Sikhs, the Delhi rulers have themselves become the 
oppressors and the terrorists." 
</P>
<P>
 Though their faith glorifies the panth, or entire community of believers, 
Sikhs are much more divided than the acting jathedar's categorical statements 
imply. 
</P>
<P>
 The finance minister of the "Delhi rulers" is a Sikh, Manmohan Singh. The 
heads of Punjab's government and police are Sikhs, and the former belongs to 
the same Congress-I Party that Indira Gandhi headed until her death. About 
two-thirds of the police and paramilitary officers in Punjab, the only state in 
India where Sikhs are in the majority, are Sikhs.

 Even the most ardent firebrand does not claim that Sikhs are inevitable 
victims. For though this group, whose name is derived from the Sanskrit word 
for disciples, constitutes less than 2% of the Indian population, it is the 
country's most successful large minority. 
</P>
<P>
 Sikhs drive taxis in New Delhi, hold commands in the Indian armed forces, till 
farms in Rajasthan and are engaged successfully in myriad trades and 
professions. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is one characteristic they collectively possess, it is stubborn, even 
defiant, resilience. 
</P>
<P>
 Their faith sprang up five centuries ago under Nanak (1469-1539), the first 
guru, and since then, they have been a minority in almost every regime they 
have lived under. Like the Jews, they have frequently been persecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 But the restoration work now going on at the Akal Takht is yet another emblem 
of their determination. Before Indian authorities handed the Golden Temple 
complex back to Sikh religious officials in 1986, they carried out extensive 
repairs to the building. But that flew in the face of the Sikhs' traditions of 
voluntary community service. So they demolished the Akal Takht again, leaving 
only a 10-foot-high base. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, barefoot workers reconstructing the facade scamper over scaffolding made 
of saplings stripped of bark and lashed together. Three-quarters of the work 
has been completed at an estimated cost of $7.7 million. About 165 pounds of 
gold have been used, as well as pearly white marble worth almost $3 million. 
The work at the Akal Takht, whose foundation stone was laid by another guru, 
Hargobind, in 1606, will be finished in about 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The central doctrine of Sikhism is that "God is one," so it is fitting that it 
emerged as a synthesis of two faiths that antedated it on Indian soil. 
</P>
<P>
 From Hinduism, Nanak took the doctrines of reincarnation and karma , or the 
idea that one's actions determine one's fate. From Islam came monotheism, as 
well as the abiding accent on brotherhood that rejected the Hindu caste system. 
</P>
<P>
 In its quintessence, Sikhism was summed up by Nanak as working hard, 
remembering God and sharing with others. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 10th and last guru, Gobind Singh, who gave the Sikhs many of their 
distinctive characteristics. Before his assassination in 1708, he announced the 
formation of a new martial order called the "Khalsa," or "pure ones." 
</P>
<P>
 To distinguish members of the Khalsa, the guru ordered them not to cut their 
hair (kes) or their beards, to carry a comb (kangha), to wear a steel bracelet 
(kara) and breeches (kach) and to carry a dagger (kirpan).  
</P>
<P>
 By these five "k's," one can still identify an orthodox Sikh. The beards and 
colorful turbans the men wear to conceal hair they are supposed leave unshorn 
make the Sikhs one of the most visible of India's ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 During Partition in 1947, which created India and Pakistan from British India 
and was preceded by savage Sikh-Muslim riots, the Sikhs opted overwhelmingly to 
become part of India. 
</P>
<P>
 Many prominent Sikhs, such as New Delhi author Khushwant Singh, believe that 
the choice made almost five decades ago has brought the Sikhs unparalleled 
prosperity and possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be clear as daylight to every thinking Sikh that whatever his 
grievances against the Center -- and there are many which are legitimate -- 
their interests will be best preserved as citizens of a secular India," Singh 
wrote last month. "A separate state will spell disaster for the Sikhs." 
</P>
<P>
 But given their turbulent history and vivid collective memories of martyrdom, 
it is not surprising that all Sikhs do not agree. In April, a half-dozen 
factions from the splintered Akali Dal party joined forces after caucusing at 
the Golden Temple and demanded that the Sikhs be granted a separate area in a 
new Indian "confederation where they could "enjoy the glow of freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Failing that, the coalition from the party that has long posed the most potent 
challenge to the Congress Party in Punjab said it reserved the right to 
struggle "democratically" for a Sikh state. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amritsar Declaration was engineered and blessed by the acting jathedar and 
by the powerbroker who got him appointed, Gurcharan Singh Tohra, Bhindranwale's 
former mentor and head of an important committee that manages Sikh temples, or 
gurdwaras.  
</P>
<P>
 But they and the motley collection of rival leaders from the Akali Dal could 
not persuade the influential head of another faction, former Punjab Chief 
Minister Parkash Singh Badal, who may today be Punjab's most popular 
politician, into joining them. 
</P>
<P>
 Badal's more moderate agenda springs from longstanding Sikh grievances. For 
instance, he wants Punjab to exercise more control over its canals and 
irrigation waterways, the lifeblood of its agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Badal camp, the pronouncements of the Jathedar are an ecclesiastical 
smoke screen to veil the political ambitions of Tohra and the reunited Akali 
Dal leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "A team of mad people" was what Punjab's chief minister, Beant Singh, who 
coincidentally bears the same name as one of Indira Gandhi's killers, called 
the authors of the Amritsar Declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 But he has political problems too. He came to power as a result of heavily 
boycotted elections in February, 1992, in which his Congress Party got 
virtually no votes from Punjab's 62% Sikh majority. For many Sikhs, he is 
indissolubly linked with the brutal campaign waged by New Delhi against armed 
Sikh militants, in which many civilians have also died. 
</P>
<P>
 Amarjit Singh, information officer at the Golden Temple, gives voice as well 
as anyone to the aspirations and dreams of his people these days. The witty man 
with the beard of an Old Testament patriarch is worried about safeguarding his 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
 India's Sikhs, he pointed out, constitute a small, and perhaps vulnerable, 
island in a sea of far bigger faiths. "After all," he says, "India used to be a 
Buddhist country at one time long ago, and Buddhism also disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't demand a separate land for the Sikhs but wants India's leaders to 
pay more attention to the wishes of a unique religious and ethnic minority. "In 
a democracy," he asked, "don't you think the elder brother should grant the 
wishes of a younger brother?"

MAGIC MOMENTS; THE CO-ED WINTER FORMAL AND OTHER DRAMAS UNFOLD

 Smells like teen formal. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardenia corsages perfume the air at La Quinta High School's winter dance, 
where other timeless traditions cling to this, the Academy Awards of teendom 
dress-up. 
</P>
<P>
 But slow dancing and staying out too late and other rites of passage coexist 
with new twists. Kids have sneaked booze into the hop since Eisenhower was 
President, but when did they get threatened with a Breathalyzer at the door? 
What used to be the quintessential date night now finds a platonic party of 32 
chartering a bus as its chariot. Do you buy your own corsage for that? 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Newport Beach's Plaza of the Flags, a food court by day is transformed 
into the site of "This Magic Moment," this year's Co-Ed dance. Christmas 
vacation, 1993, is approaching, and the winter blahs have been fought off for 
this pivotal night. 
</P>
<P>
 A DJ spins the dance songs as couples break off to pose for those cherished 
photos their children will one day giggle at hysterically. Click. Yes, girls 
still sign their photo backs. 
</P>
<P>
 A few of the teen-agers are buzzing on wine, daring chaperons to catch them. 
Most are sober. And you can easily find a few griping about that. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can anyone loosen up?" one partier asks, mock incredulous. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules for this year's Co-Ed: no drinking tolerated; no leaving the dance 
for any reason and no returning to the parking lot until the end, and no 
"inappropriate" attire -- last year one girl wore a see-through dress. They 
have been warned a Breathalyzer may be employed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's less drinking and drugs than 10 years ago," Principal Mitch 
Thomas says later. "I used to have to deny or carry away a kid from an event 
because he couldn't walk. I think there's still marijuana use among the kids 
today, but we used to get five-pound bags on kids (who would say), 'Oh Mr. 
Thomas, I found it on my way to school and didn't know what it was!' You don't 
see anything like that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Amber Myers, a 17-year-old senior, has on a great dress from Contempo Casuals 
but is not happy with the dance music. "It's old," she said of the '80s tunes. 
Her date, Anthony, is a friend. "I don't have a boyfriend. I was supposed to 
come with some guy. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 An adorable blonde rushes up and collapses in a nearby chair. She has big 
cascading curls to go with her snit, as the 20 or so candidates for Co-Ed King 
are lined up for introduction, pageant style. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am so fat," she says, all of maybe 100 pounds. "All the girls started 
hating me because I stole the guy they wanted. . . I was a slut, I was a 
virgin. It's like they're insecure in themselves. A lot of girls at school have 
to rip on each other," she says, perfectly contemptuous and righteous. "I lived 
in the Bronx, and it's like, 'get a grip!' " 
</P>
<P>
 She has not spent all four years at La Quinta High School, and through her 
tough I'm-East-Coast bravado -- one can see her frustration at not being fully 
accepted. Her boyfriend is obviously a Big Guy on Campus and the object of 
aggressive cute chicks. She sits in the shadows as another girl escorts him to 
the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 As Paul Herrera is announced the boy with the sexiest legs, the blonde claps, 
then says the girl escorting her boyfriend flattered herself by suggesting she 
might actually be able to steal the boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 "She says to me, 'you wanna fight?' 'I'm like, what are you gonna do, stab me 
with mascara?' " The blonde starts laughing. "I mean, get a life!" 
</P>
<P>
 After the dance, she and her boyfriend are going alone to a hotel for the 
night with a hot tub in the room. The boyfriend's parents, told that a group of 
kids were going to celebrate in the room, put the bill on their credit card.  
</P>
<P>
 After Watson Visuwan's coronation, the blonde remarks that she's happy "the W 
guy won. All these Vietnamese names -- W, V -- I don't know them." But she and 
the couples around her are pleased that Watson -- an agreeable football and 
track star -- was crowned Co-Ed king because he deserved it. Besides his other 
charms, he has school "spirit" -- that vaguely defined quality that, say, Kurt 
Cobain lacked -- and he gets along well with everybody. He fits in. 
</P>
<P>
 He is part of the mixed race troika of academic, student government and sports 
leadership that still reigns in school popularity. Associated Student Body 
President Jennifer Chapman is white; vice president Thanh Tang is Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
 While it can be said that the majority of students at La Quinta of all races 
coexist, even get along, there seems to be an unspoken code: Don't make a big 
deal of it. I notice that terminology does not trip them up; they don't seem to 
hesitate over whether to say Hispanic or Latino, black or African American. 
</P>
<P>
 Various students will talk off the record about racial differences -- any 
differences, for that matter -- and male students fresh off the dance floor 
collect around a blonde athlete as he starts to explain. "Like the Orientals," 
he says, wiping his sweaty forehead with his tux sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Vietnamese people are totally cool with themselves," says another athlete 
and class officer type. "They tend to get along with everyone because of that. 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The group of guys -- mostly white, with a few Latinos -- goes on to sound off 
about all manner of school irritants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those people who buy yearbooks, play sports, all's they care about is 
themselves," notes a brown-haired youth who does neither. He is bored, and the 
lingering effects of a marijuana joint smoked before the dance are starting to 
wear off. "The dance was fun. I love this school. I wanna go five years." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, right. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For some reason, these guys couldn't care less if I go to their post-dance 
party, as long as I don't print anybody's name without permission. Since I 
returned to my 1977 alma mater to chronicle the changed school, students have 
seemed comfortable with my presence at all sorts of public and private moments, 
trusting me not to hurt them. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Co-Ed goers are supposedly going night horseback riding, but the 
stables are way out in Corona. So it's on to the party, on a Westminster 
cul-de-sac around the corner from where I grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving unfashionably early at 12:30 a.m., I have to wait parked across the 
street like a stakeout until the kids who invited me arrive. I don't even have 
kids, and I feel like a parent. Souped up cars and trucks are screeching by at 
high speed, showing off for party-going stragglers outside. A voice in my head 
is screaming: "Someone could get killed!" 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone else seems unconcerned. 
</P>
<P>
 On the driveway around 1:30 a.m., a clutch of guys stands around drinking cans 
of Miller, which was absolutely easy to score at a nearby liquor store. They 
drift one or two at a time behind a hedge to smoke marijuana, and a few of the 
jocks pass around a pot pipe. It's the only visible drug. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're tossed!," one kid says to a slightly tottering friend. 
</P>
<P>
 The party hostess -- her dad was gone until later but knew of the party -- 
wanders outside to say hello and then returns to the house, where all is low 
volume and extremely tame by the standards set in my mid-'70s days, when so 
many kids would attend a party sometimes that cars could not enter a street. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Along comes Eric Sizelove, a lanky senior on the water polo team. For now, he 
is "kickin' it, having a mellow time." For now, with the help of coaches and 
Principal Mitch Thomas, he is making it, bearing big dreams of a scholarship 
and a four-year college stint. 
</P>
<P>
 I had found Eric a few days before the Co-Ed, ditching his third period 
English class and lingering in the room of another teacher. Dressed in a long 
flannel shirt, backward hat and oversize jeans, he slouches in the teacher's 
chair. His short hair is shiny brown, his earring shiny gold.  
</P>
<P>
 It is no accident that he appears like he can take care of himself, although 
his toothy smile distracts from the homeboy look. He is reading over one of his 
graded English papers while students are learning how to speak English in the 
background. 
</P>
<P>
 His story is no less sad for its familiarity. His father was killed in a 
motorcycle crash when Eric was in fourth grade, and life seems to have been a 
struggle ever since. His mother remarried a man Eric disliked, and years of 
battles followed, although stepfather and mother are now divorcing. His mother 
has been slowly dying of a lung disorder, but the two never discuss it beyond 
her being "really sick." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior in high school, he has effectively been raising himself and not doing 
such a good job of it. 
</P>
<P>
 But transferring to La Quinta High School this year seems to have turned 
around some festering problems. Raised in a rough Westminster neighborhood, 
Eric grew up with gangs and their code of behavior. The fist or the knife or 
the gun answered an insult, some chump from enemy turf maddogging you. 
</P>
<P>
 By junior high school he had sent one schoolmate to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, I was a push toy; boys picked on me, and I had to prove to myself I 
wasn't going to be like that. My freshman year I got straight A's." 
</P>
<P>
 But then he somehow broke his hand and was kicked off the Westminster High 
School basketball team for missing a game to visit his critically ill mother in 
the hospital. They told him he didn't have the necessary determination and 
attitude, he says. One gets the sense quickly, however, that Eric had some 
other trouble at the school that he summarizes as constant fight-picking by 
"Asian gangs" because his clothes told them he was a rival Latino gangbanger. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Eric says, he was hanging out with 30 fellow members of a dance crew 
called Footprints, a group of guys that goes to clubs and dances against other 
crews. "We kicked out the druggies and gang types," he notes. 
</P>
<P>
 "My crew" avoids battles, he contends, but he admits that competition at dance 
clubs over all manner of things -- a glare, a girlfriend -- routinely can lead 
to fights. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just how life is," he says with a slight shrug. "I face violence every 
day. I face violence when I wake up in the morning. It's something that I have 
to do so I'm not a statistic." 
</P>
<P>
 It is easy to see how some classmates and more than a few teachers conclude 
over time that trouble doesn't follow Eric; he seems to ask for it with his 
confrontational mouth. He constantly has the periscope up, scanning for signs 
of disrespect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never hurt someone with an object," he says slowly, leaning back in the 
teacher's wooden desk chair. "I don't believe in hurting someone to the point 
of dying. When I was in seventh or eighth grade, I broke a couple of ribs, beat 
up a guy and put him in the hospital. Since my junior or senior year, I decided 
I wasn't going to do that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 About midway through his time at Westminster High School, Eric's 
angry-at-the-world attitude contributed to some other problems, and he 
transferred to La Quinta, a less tumultuous campus at the other side of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days before the Co-Ed dance, he is saying that La Quinta has been better 
for him because it's "safer, smaller, so people know each other and you have 
more of a sense that nobody's gonna start trouble. But it's more boring," he 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Adults such as basketball coach Jim Perry and water polo coach Mark Cholette 
have worked tirelessly with Eric, knowing that sports could ultimately save him 
by delivering the identity, sense of belonging and worth that gangs gave him 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 They are sensitive to those times when he needs to miss water polo or 
basketball practice because his mother, a hairdresser when she can work, falls 
ill. But with the tenderness come unwavering rules. They are firm on 
discipline, being a team member and winning and losing with grace. And they 
watch him teeter on the fence, ready to catch him before he may fall. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, it has worked, and Eric appreciates that "school is good; teachers are 
nice, and Mr. Perry understands what I'm going through." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bell rings and class is over. After her mostly Vietnamese-speaking 
students leave the room, teacher Barbara Henry walks to her desk to hear how 
things went with Eric. I tell her I'm stunned by his resignation about his 
turbulent life, and to violence. She shakes her head, dark elbow-length hair 
falling over her shoulder. Dressed in jeans, a black sweater and loafers, she 
looks far younger than she is. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is not as we remember it in high school," she says with a deep exhale, 
and she sees this not just with her students but her children's classmates. 
"They are dealing with so much more. The parents are at work all the time. 
These kids are raising themselves. You have to look around and say, 'These kids 
are not as bad as they seem, given what they're dealing with.' You wonder how 
some of them make it. The kids who are coddled don't always (make it). Those 
who have to work, do." 
</P>
<P>
 From coach Perry's standpoint, school officials do as much as they can -- and 
then more. "The problem is, they gotta go back to their neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Of Eric, he says, "he and his stepdad don't get along; his mom's gonna die. 
You couldn't pay me enough to be in that young man's shoes. It's easy to take 
care of non-problem kids who say please and thank you. Eric needs . . . 
somebody to chew on him. We got him through water polo with a lot of strokes. 
He was the only kid in the (Garden Grove) league who made the county all-star 
team. He's got some really good skills. He's interested in one of the Top 10 
college water polo programs in America." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Eric is concentrating on making the basketball team. But he will have 
more than that to worry about by spring.
