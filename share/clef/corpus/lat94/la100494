ART REVIEW; WILLIAM BLAKE'S VISION SHINES IN HIS PRINTS AT HUNTINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a curious, dated look to William Blake's art. The piquant problem is 
that it's impossible to tack down when that date would be. 
</P>
<P>
 The British poet, mystic and artist was born into 18th-Century Rococo, lived 
through Napoleonic Neoclassicism and into the dawn of the Romanticism he 
inadvertently helped invent. He loved the Gothic and Renaissance past -- 
especially Michelangelo. He let such influences show in his work. 
</P>
<P>
 But Blake's work also looks as if it could have been made right here in 
Angeltown within living memory. It's not too much of a stretch to imagine him 
as a contemporary of L.A. artist-poets like Wallace Berman and George Herms in 
the late 1950s. Like Blake, they were visionaries who lived on the margins and 
did their own printing. 
</P>
<P>
 It fits right into this scenario that one of the world's greatest collections 
of Blake's work is right here in San Marino at the Huntington Library and Art 
Gallery. It certainly was not assembled with the notion of identifying Blake as 
the spiritual father of L.A.'s Beat Generation free spirits, flower children 
and outsider artists, but the coincidence is so delicious as to feel fated. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there is a very special exhibition in celebration of the Huntington's 75th 
anniversary, "William Blake's Illuminated Prints, 1799-1822." The gallery has 
done numerous exhibitions of these admired holdings but this one is singular. 
The 95 or so images it contains were previously bound in books and could only 
be seen a couple at a time. When it was discovered the volumes were 
deteriorating, there was nothing to do but take them loose. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a blessing in disguise. Framed, mounted on gallery walls, and restored, 
they clarify the artist's sensibility dramatically. The hand-colored relief 
technique he invented gives the prints unusual sensuous presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake specialist Robert N. Essick organized the show and thoughtfully wrote 
the companion book, "William Blake at the Huntington." His deft juxtaposition 
of images takes us from postage-stamp-size early works like "All Religions Are 
One" with their sweet Rococo feel, to monumentally scaled apocalyptic 
masterpieces like "Satan Exulting Over Eve" on loan from the J. Paul Getty 
Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Getty work's tendril line makes its two nude bodies weightlessly erotic, 
lending the picture an unsettling power that renders rank evil into something 
both beautiful and desirable. No doubt such work helped fuel Art Nouveau's 
decadent appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to it, like the other side of a coin, hangs "Hecate" (or "The Night of 
Enitharmon's Joy") freighted with guilt and foreboding. It was clearly 
influenced by the nightmare visions of Blake's friend Henry Fuseli, but it 
outstrips its source, joining the ranks of images so profound as to become 
branded on the brain. You think of Durer's "Melencolia I" and Goya's great 
prints. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the rare reviews of Blake's art in his lifetime, a critic described 
him as "an unfortunate lunatic whose personal inoffensiveness secures him from 
confinement."  
</P>
<P>
 It is said Blake literally sang the poems in "Songs of Innocence and 
Experience" to tunes of his own devising. (When poet Allen Ginsberg tried to 
re-create this chanting, he became persuaded that graphic devices like the tree 
branches that enlace the verses of "The Tyger" actually function as musical 
notation.) 
</P>
<P>
 A friend once found the artist and his wife, Catherine, nude in the garden 
playing Adam and Eve. She said of her husband, "I have very little of Mr. 
Blake's company; he is always in Paradise." 
</P>
<P>
 He was also pugnacious, paranoid and a trial to the little band of supporters 
and patrons that eventually gathered around him. He complained of poverty but 
rejected official posts. He said Sir Joshua Reynolds, head of the Royal 
Academy, "was hired to depress art." 
</P>
<P>
 He was brought to court and charged with sedition after he threw a drunken 
soldier out of his garden. There is almost no way to avoid placing him 
somewhere on the continuum between psychopath and major eccentric. 
</P>
<P>
 Except one. The work itself reveals a man with a complete complement of human 
feelings to which he had uninhibited access. Much of his conventionally odd 
behavior can be traced to a perfectly sane desire to protect the freedom of his 
inner life. After initial enthusiasm for the French Revolution, the Terror 
convinced him that humanity could not be achieved with politics but only with a 
revolution of the human spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems likely that Blake's insistence on leaving himself internally 
interconnected fueled the boggling range of his talents. Today, he is virtually 
unique in holding a top rank as both artist and poet, as well as being taken 
with scholarly seriousness as a political, philosophical and metaphysical seer. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be worth keeping in mind the next time our friends look at us as if 
we're a little nuts.

COUPLE'S DIFFERENCES WERE A MATTER OF STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Earlier this century, art historians were confused by the apparent split 
personality of successful 19th-Century American still-life painter William 
Harnett. Some of his canvases were strikingly illusionistic, while others were 
bathed in a dusty, atmospheric haze. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to historical spadework by art critic Alfred Frankenstein, it turned 
out that the latter works really were by one John Peto, an obscure friend of 
Harnett's. Although Peto's output is more uneven than Harnett's, his best work 
is not inferior, just different in mood and scope. 
</P>
<P>
 The still-life styles of two of Peto's contemporaries, William Joseph 
McCloskey and Alberta Binford McCloskey, offer a different kind of contrast. 
Guest curated for the Bowers Museum by Nancy Dustin Wall Moure, a specialist in 
19th-Century California art, "Partners in Illusion" (through Dec. 31) includes 
31 of 40 paintings by the couple that are in the museum's permanent collection. 
</P>
<P>
 The McCloskeys were prosperous still-life and portrait painters during the 
1880s and 1890s whose peripatetic lives took them to Los Angeles, New York and 
San Francisco. Both emphasized surface effects (though convincing depictions of 
wood grain eluded both of them) and neither seems to have been interested in 
invoking the somber, centuries-old memento mori symbolism of fruit and flower 
still lifes. 
</P>
<P>
 Alberta's rendering of glass and reflective surfaces, stock qualities of 
trompe l'oeil painting since the 17th Century, are dazzlingly illusionistic. 
William tended to soften and generalize his surfaces -- but not so definitively 
as to create a significant sense of mood a la Peto. (Annoyingly, the couple's 
still lifes don't hang next to each other, making it difficult to compare the 
two styles.) 
</P>
<P>
 While Alberta painstakingly reproduced the specific textures of tissue paper, 
orange peels or flower petals, William's paintings make you aware that they 
were, in fact, painted . Separate brush strokes clearly are visible, as are 
such little shorthand tricks as the virtually identical splotches of red on the 
yellow apples in "Untitled (apples spilling from glass bowl)." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a far cry from the heightened approach to the act of reproducing 
three-dimensional forms on a two-dimensional surface that produced the 
revolution of modern art. (During the same years, working in near-obscurity in 
southern France, Paul Cezanne made extraordinary experiments with weight and 
mass in still-life painting.) 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by other works on view, however, William was the flashier figure 
painter. His portraits of little girls capture the silky luminousness of small 
children, if little sense of their inner lives. The well-to-do young sitters' 
fine garments show off William's dexterity at painting lace and organdy. 
</P>
<P>
 In a detour from such bread-and-butter commissions, a 1916 portrait of "Jeff," 
an ambulance driver at Los Angeles County Hospital (where William may have 
worked for a while), is rare for its era in depicting a black man as a 
thoughtful human being rather than as a stock figure of amusement or menace. 
</P>
<P>
 Such paintings make it hard to agree with Moure's comment in a wall text that 
William's post-1899 works -- after his separation from Alberta and subsequent 
nervous breakdown -- "lack some of the inner human spark seen in the earlier 
ones." Indeed, they seem more psychological and less reliant on surface 
brilliance. 
</P>
<P>
 The artists' genre scenes, on the other hand, are so larded with the 
sentimental staginess favored by middle-class turn-of-the-century taste that 
they are little more than period pieces. Typically, more care seems to have 
been lavished on the furniture and rugs in these scenes than on the saccharine 
figures in stock poses. 
</P>
<P>
 Moure also curated the Bowers' concurrent exhibition, "Easels in the Arroyos: 
Plein Air Paintings from the Permanent Collection," which offers the usual 
array of plein air views of a beautifully unspoiled California, painted in 
styles that are overwhelmingly flaccid and derivative and that by the 1920s and 
'30s were woefully out of date. Nostalgic subject matter and collectors' vested 
interest in keeping market prices high seem to be the twin reasons these 
paintings have such vocal supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its title, the show also includes 19th-Century and Tonalist works as 
well as such rarities as May Schaetzel's curious Symbolist landscape "Lost in 
the Woods" and an Abstract Expressionist canvas by the late Ed Kienholz, 
painted a few years before he began making the assemblages that secured his 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Another unexpected bonus: Frederick Hammersley's witty abstraction "Four," an 
example of the new, hard-edged style that developed in Los Angeles in the 
1950s, when the Southland was beginning to awaken from provincial torpor. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Partners in Illusion: William J. and Alberta McCloskey" and "Easels in the 
Arroyos: Plein Air Paintings from the Permanent Collection" continue through 
Dec. 31 at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art, 2002 N. Main St., Santa Ana. 
Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays through Sundays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; 
Thursdays till 9 p.m. $1.50 to $4.50. (714) 567-3600. SHORT STROKES: Years ago, 
painter Rex Brandt remarked in a catalogue essay that he responded to "space 
and time and movement more than to volume and things." In "On the Road to San 
Jacinto" -- one of several works by Brandt in a show of California regionalism 
from the 1920s, '30s and '40s at the Irvine Museum -- he bears out his 
self-analysis with a view of a lonely rural scene at dusk. Surrounded by tall, 
undulating grasses, a farmhouse mailbox with a long gray slot casts its blind 
eye on a curve in a road that seems to lead nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In common with other paintings from the '30s in this show, the scene has a 
melancholy air not normally associated with the vintage art of sunny 
California. But the Depression colored many styles, from the anecdotal realism 
of Barse Miller ("Migrant America") to the abbreviated impressions of Dan Lutz 
("End of the Line"). Trudging men in overcoats seem to be everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 As social documents, such paintings offer insight into a remote era. Several 
are familiar from repeated showings at the Laguna Art Museum and elsewhere. A 
few of the artists (Brandt, Millard Zornes, Phil Paradise) had beguilingly 
idiosyncratic viewpoints and individualistic styles. But there is a lot of 
blandly descriptive work in the show, and even the better paintings lack the 
extra dimension of metaphorical observation that distinguishes such 
contemporaries as Edward Hopper and George Burchfield. * "Visions of 
California" continues through Nov. 12 at the Irvine Museum, 18881 Von Karman 
Ave., 12th floor, Irvine. 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays. Free. 
(714) 476-2565.

 Eagles Cancel: The Eagles on Monday postponed the remainder of the group's 
much touted "Hell Freezes Over" reunion tour, including Saturday's show at the 
Rose Bowl. The postponement was caused by group member Glenn Frey's continuing 
gastrointestinal disorder, for which he will undergo surgery as soon as 
possible in Los Angeles. Canceled are all October U.S. dates, as are November 
and December dates in Australia and Japan. The concerts will be rescheduled for 
early 1995; organizers were working out a new Rose Bowl date on Monday.

 Mellencamp's Testimony: "The moral of my story is that 80 cigarettes a day and 
a cholesterol level of 300 is like a loaded gun." So says rocker John 
Mellencamp, 42, who last month canceled the remainder of his concert tour, 
citing a clogged artery in his heart. In an interview in the Sunday 
Herald-Times of Bloomington, Ind., Mellencamp also confirmed that he suffered a 
mild heart attack in August. He said he is taking medication, has begun a diet 
and exercise program, and is down to three or four cigarettes a day. TELEVISION

 And the Winner Is . . . The battle of the Thursday night medical dramas is

switch time slots with "Eye to Eye With Connie Chung," meaning the hospital 
series will be seen Thursdays at 9 p.m. -- opposite NBC's powerhouse "Seinfeld" 
-- followed by the newsmagazine at 10 p.m. "ER" beat "Chicago Hope" in each of 
their two matchups, increasing its ratings lead last week to nearly double the 
opposition.

cooperation and exchange between U.S. and Mexican artists, include $25,000 for 
Santa Monica's 18th Street Arts Complex, which will present "Chicano/Chilango," 
described as the United States' "first binational dialogue and performance art 
exchange" with Mexico City. The series, scheduled for February, will be curated 
by performance artist Guillermo Gomez-Pena and producer Josephine Ramirez, and 
will include performances at Plaza de la Raza. Another grantee is the Santa 
Monica Museum of Art, which will receive $17,750 for a catalogue to accompany 
the planned 1996 exhibition "Dialogue/Dialogo/Comhra," curated by Trisha Ziff. 
The exhibition will compare notions of cultural identity among contemporary 
Irish, Mexican and Chicano artists. Other local grant recipients are 
documentary filmmakers Renee Tajima ($25,000) and Sylvia Stevens ($23,000); 
artist Gustavo Leclerc ($14,660) and the multimedia performance group Collage 
Ensemble ($4,700). QUICK TAKES

the network has no writer for the show yet and hasn't even determined whether 
it will be a drama or comedy, CBS said. . . . Keith Moore, a London accountant 
who used to work for rock star Sting, appeared in a British court Monday, 
accused of stealing about $4.7 million from the rock star between 1988 and 
1992. . . . Rock group Danzig will make an in-store appearance at the Sunset 
Boulevard Tower Records from 5 to 7 p.m. today, followed by a free concert at 9 
p.m. at the Whisky. . . . Nearly 5 million kids across the country pledged more 
than 31 million hours of volunteer service over the weekend during "The Big

MUSIC REVIEW; MIXED RESULTS FOR HALPRIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the departure of founder-music director Micah Levy -- who is off 
furthering his conducting studies -- the Orange County Chamber Orchestra has 
looked into its ranks to fill the gap. Concertmaster Diana Halprin has stepped 
up to the podium and directorship of the group; Sunday afternoon at Irvine 
Barclay Theatre, she got its 12th season underway. 
</P>
<P>
 Halprin has some conducting experience under her belt and in her debut 
directing the OCCO, she looked confident with a baton in her hand, leading in a 
clear, lyrical, no-nonsense style. 
</P>
<P>
 Can she improve the orchestra to a point where it is something other than a 
couple-dozen or so free-lancers who get together four times a season? Only time 
will tell. Right now the group lacks distinction: To overstate its merits or 
liabilities would be misleading. Sunday's results were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Halprin began the concert with the Concertino No. 6 thought once to be the 
work of Pergolesi and tentatively ascribed to Carlo Ricciotti in the program, 
but now known certainly and widely (except to these performers) as the work of 
Unico Wilhelm van Wassenaer. Halprin led an easygoing run-through, with a not 
altogether convincing electronic imitation of a harpsichord in support. 
</P>
<P>
 After a break in which she warmed up offstage, Halprin returned with violin in 
hand to play Beethoven's Violin Concerto, as new concertmaster Joseph Goodman 
took on the conducting duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Halprin, a onetime student of such violin luminaries as Galamian, Gingold and 
Milstein, gave a leisurely account of the score, technically first-rate, 
affectionate and assured. She turned up the intensity level a notch in the 
showy Fritz Kreisler cadenzas. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman managed to pull some full sounds from the tiny orchestra (only eight 
violins for the concerto), and the woodwinds contributed glowing work, but he 
consistently lagged behind his soloist. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission Halprin returned to the conductor's spot and offered a 
generally warm, occasionally forceful, unhurried and fairly messy account of 
Mozart's Symphony No. 40.

 ROBBIE ROBERTSON & THE RED ROAD ENSEMBLE

<P>
 "The Native Americans" 
</P>
<P>
 Capitol  
</P>
<P>
 Forget what you probably think about Native American music. While traditional 
drumming and chanting provides the thread that runs through this ambitious 
collection, the wide range of contemporary aesthetics Robertson and his roster 
of top native musicians utilize is striking. 
</P>
<P>
 The real stunner is "Mahk Jchi" (The Heart of the People), a lilting melody 
sung by the female trio Ulali that could easily be mistaken for a Gaelic tune. 
Other tracks have a mystical, world-music quality that is often hypnotic, 
transcending their film-score duty and standing on their own merits. 
</P>
<P>
 The several more "conventional" songs featuring Robertson's limited voice 
benefit from the haunting, spiritual atmosphere, though at times his lyrics 
make somewhat forced use of historical native legends. But Robertson never 
tries to steal the spotlight from the talented people he's enlisted, and with 
luck this will bring their own work to wider attention. New albums are rated on 
a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars (good) and four stars 
(excellent).

POP MUSIC REVIEW; MOODY FOLK FROM SMITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "It's nice to be using electricity and playing for people instead of 
chickens," said Kendra Smith during her show at McCabe's on Sunday. Smith, who 
went into backwoods seclusion seven years ago, was the original bassist for 
early-'80s L.A. rock band the Dream Syndicate, and she preceded Hope Sandoval 
in the group that would become Mazzy Star, so Sunday's show -- her first-ever 
solo appearance here -- was a highly anticipated homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
 No one really knew what to expect of Smith, who now lives in a remote area of 
Northern California with no phone or electricity. But the thin singer delivered 
hypnotically moody, surreal numbers with a folky but foreboding edge.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith sang of villagers, wishing wells and silk while slapping a drum or 
playing minimal guitar. She also coaxed sober carnival tones and dark, ancient 
drones from an old pump organ while an accompanist hit chimes, plucked a bass 
or played stand-up drums. Smith's more intense vocal moments rang of early 
Grace Slick, but she also sounded like a sultry beat poet while snapping her 
fingers to a number by the German experimental band Can.  
</P>
<P>
 Capped by Lisa Germano's gut-wrenching set, the show marked an intense, 
compelling conclusion to 4AD Records' six-night "All Virgos Are Mad" festival.

 RICH KINGS: The Junk Bond King edges the Lion King. In Forbes magazine's new 
list of the 400 richest Americans, Encino's Michael Milken ranks higher (250) 
than Roy Disney (263), who oversees Disney's animation department. . . . Milken 
has an estimated worth of $450 million. Disney's $420 million includes 
ownership of Shamrock Holdings Inc., which has interests in TV and radio 
stations. . . . Also listed: Disney Co. CEO Michael Eisner, ranked 352 on the 
list and worth a mere $340 million. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW IMAGES: He works near Universal Studios, but publisher J. Edward Giles III 
isn't interested in the world of make-believe. With his new quarterly, "Image," 
he hopes to "empower the man of color" with stories that overcome existing 
perceptions of African Americans (E1). . . . New magazines about Latinos and 
Asian Americans also seek to change impressions. 
</P>
<P>
 THEY'RE BACK: Hotels and apartment buildings are again filling up because of 
the earthquake. This time, new tenants need temporary housing while 
long-delayed repairs are finally made to their homes (B1). . . . "My wife and I 
look at it like it's our own little cabin," says David Ustin (above), CEO of 
Western Bagel Baking Co., who stays with his wife in a Warner Center hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHER VALUE: What do a producer of television infomercials and a provider of 
payroll processing services have in common? Not much, except both are Valley 
companies that made big stock gains during the just-completed third quarter 
(Valley Business, Page 8). . . . Overall, 58% of local stocks went up in value, 
a far cry from the first two quarters of 1994, when about 60% suffered losses. 
</P>
<P>
 BUS BUST: One stock that isn't doing well is Greyhound. The nation's largest 
intercity bus company, which emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in 
1991, has new cash problems and has lost riders (D1). . . . Locally, Greyhound 
stops in North Hollywood, San Fernando, Glendale and Lancaster. Michael Arkush

 PROLIFIC PESTS: First it was two Mediterranean fruit flies in a Camarillo fig 
tree. Now, 31 more have been found nearby (B1). . . . For every trapped fly, 
1,000 more usually lurk close by, laying their eggs inside lemons, avocados and 
other fruit. And in good weather, it can take just three weeks for a fly to 
hatch and lay eggs of its own. . . . "They are very prolific and they just 
multiply like crazy," said Larry Yee, county director for the U.C. Cooperative 
Extension. "That's under optimum conditions and along the coast it's pretty 
optimum." 
</P>
<P>
 CITRUS CELEBRITY: So is Ojai citrus rancher Peter Strauss worried about the 
Medfly? Members of the Ojai Valley Woman's Club will get a chance to ask him. . 
. . The Emmy-winning actor -- perhaps best known for his role in the landmark 
miniseries "Rich Man, Poor Man," -- has accepted an invitation to speak to the 
club Thursday. He'll talk about his life as an actor and a rancher. . . . "The 
women here are in a tizzy," club President Glennetta Berthelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 GROWING UP: Talk about a growth spurt. Since its founding 24 years ago, 
Kinko's Service Corp. has gone from a photocopy store catering to college 
students to a multimillion-dollar firm with 725 stores worldwide (Valley 
Business, Page 12). . . . Kinko's latest venture: a $20-million investment in 
video conference rooms. . . . "All technology takes a burn-in period," said Dan 
Frederickson, president of the firm. Michael Guarnieri, above, sets up a video 
conference in Ventura store. 
</P>
<P>
 UNITY MARCH: Opponents of an initiative that would deny many public benefits 
to illegal immigrants will take to the streets Wednesday. . . . Foes of 
Proposition 187 will march from Ventura College to the County Government Center 
to oppose the measure, which seeks to deny schooling, non-emergency health care 
and other benefits to illegal immigrants. . . . "This is one way to show 
potential voters about the effect we believe 187 would have on our community," 
said Armando Garcia of the Ventura County Immigrant Rights Coalition.

REPORT FROM CHILDREN NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Children Called Key Political Issue" (Sept. 25) discussed what educators have 
known all along. It is a sad state of affairs when 20% of our eighth-graders 
cannot write a simple essay. Well, approximately a third of our college 
graduates cannot write a basic letter. We pride ourselves on a decreased high 
school dropout rate. The sad truth is we are graduating more functional 
illiterates. It's a shame when our public schoolteachers have over 300 students 
in a course and only 26-30 books for all of the students. Books become a 
precious commodity -- for the teachers, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 We live in the shadow of some of the richest technology-driven industries in 
the country, yet some of our schools train students on antiquated equipment. We 
live in the shadow of some of the most palatial homes on earth, yet we send our 
children to schools that are falling apart. We build, install and hire the best 
security money can buy to protect our material goods, yet we fail to protect 
our most valuable asset (our children) and allow them to be gunned down on 
school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Our cities have become war zones and we send our defenseless children into the 
streets to fend for themselves. With all the problems our children confront 
daily, no wonder they are so agitated and angry. The real world for students in 
certain areas is survival. The best investment we can make in our future is 
shaping our children. Someday, whether we like it or not, they will be the 
leaders. What we teach our youth today will be their foundation for tomorrow.

 * Children Now of Los Angeles asks the electorate to elect leaders "that put 
the interests of children first by investing in the right start for every 
child." The right start for a child is to be born to two mature parents who 
want the child, have the ability to nurture and care for the child and support 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Children Now says "it requires constant pressure from the public to demand 
that our elected officials do right by our kids." Children don't appear out of 
thin air; it is those who produce children who need to do right by their kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Children Now blames many of the deaths of babies before their first birthday 
on lack of proper prenatal care. A child born to a child, a teen-age mother, 
out of wedlock, is the one most likely to lack proper prenatal care, have 
little chance for nurture and guidance, suffer abuse, and live in poverty. 
Children Now needs also to address the irresponsible insemination that produces 
so-called fatherless children -- every child has a father as well as a mother!

A RESIGNATION THAT WAS IN ORDER; SECRETARY ESPY'S ETHICAL LAPSES OVERSHADOW THE 
GOOD THAT HE ACCOMPLISHED AT USDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U. S. Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy did the right thing Monday when he 
resigned. During his tenure in President Clinton's Cabinet, he accepted 
tickets, trips and accommodations for himself and a traveling companion from 
people and firms that either do business with or are regulated by his 
department. He eventually repaid the gifts and favors, but by his own 
admission, Espy should have been more careful. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's top agriculture job is held to a much higher standard than other 
Cabinet posts. The stricter laws result from the federal Meat Inspection Act of 
1907. This law, which remains on the books, prohibits the acceptance of any 
gratuity by anyone who regulates the meat industry. The court-appointed 
independent counsel, Donald Smaltz of Los Angeles, will continue his 
investigation of Espy.  
</P>
<P>
 Espy accepted gifts and favors from Tyson Foods Inc., the nation's largest 
poultry producer, as well as from Quaker Oats and Sun Diamond of California. In 
one alleged instance, Tyson was providing gifts at a time when Agriculture 
officials were considering tougher inspections and sanitary regulations in 
poultry plants. There is no proof that Espy took the luxuries in exchange for 
providing more lenient treatment of poultry plants. But the timing at the very 
least looks bad. 
</P>
<P>
 His continuing problems also focused an embarrassing spotlight on the 
questionable relationship that the Clintons have enjoyed with Arkansas-based 
Tyson Foods. The President has often been accused of accepting favors from the 
head of the corporation, Don Tyson, a prominent Arkansas Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 While in office, Espy traveled at government expense to his home state of 
Mississippi -- where his children live -- 20 times during 20 months in office. 
In that same time period, he only visited California once, even though it is a 
key agricultural state. Government-paid visits home may be routine in Congress, 
where Espy served three terms before he joined the Clinton Administration. 
While it is not against the law for a Cabinet officer to take so many 
government-paid trips home, it is highly unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Espy's lapses overshadowed the good that he accomplished at 
USDA. The department aggressively tightened meat regulations after Jack in the 
Box hamburgers tainted with E. coli bacteria killed two children and gave food 
poisoning to hundreds. On his watch, USDA also improved school lunches and 
opened new markets for American farm products. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy's resignation won't halt the investigation by the independent counsel. 
That probe should proceed to clear his name or prove any wrongdoing. Espy's 
fall should remind Washington that ethics must always come first in government.

DON'T TAKE THE PLUNGE WITHOUT A SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just this past summer, the county Parks and Recreation Department started 
charging a dollar for kids to use county pools. The community rightly was 
outraged that needy children were getting priced out of swimming, and the 
county and responsible business interests worked quickly to ensure that county 
pool admission would remain free. Now there's another issue about pools and 
needy kids, and a solution again will depend on public and private interests 
working cooperatively. 
</P>
<P>
 This time the pool in question is the 1932 Olympic swimming stadium in 
Exposition Park. It has served as the largest public swim facility in the city 
of Los Angeles. On summer days, as many as 1,400 recreational swimmers -- 
mostly kids -- swam and splashed in the shadows of the L.A. Memorial Coliseum. 
And 250 more youngsters were involved in competitive swim programs there. 
</P>
<P>
 However, because of serious quake damage to the natatorium, officials are 
considering razing the entire facility, pool and all, to make way for a parking 
structure for Raider and Clipper fans. 
</P>
<P>
 But before they pave over this community's recreation paradise and put up a 
parking lot, the city and Coliseum commissioners must guarantee that children 
living in the neighborhoods near Vermont Avenue and Martin Luther King Jr. 
Boulevard have a place to swim. And it should be somewhere near the old site. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the insistence? When the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics Organizing Committee 
got a funding commitment to build a $4-million swim stadium on the nearby 
campus of the University of Southern California, officials promised that the 
pool would be open to the surrounding community. That didn't happen as planned 
because, among other reasons, the pool lacked a "shallow end." Fortunately the 
city was able to turn to an old standby: the 1932 Olympic pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the threat of demolition looming there are no clear alternatives for 
a new site. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why groups like the Amateur Athletic Foundation, which is entrusted 
with distributing proceeds from the 1984 summer games to Southern California 
youth, rightly are resisting any sudden move to tear down the old pool until 
officials can guarantee completion of a new one in the Exposition Park area.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they can fund a new pool with $7 million from a 1992 bond 
issue and additional money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Good. 
But they should also remember that the community deserves a comparable pool in 
a comparable location.

SET NO DEADLINE FOR HAITI WITHDRAWAL; DISARM THE THUGS BUT DON'T RISK U.S. 
LIVES WITH A CUTOFF DATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American troops in Haiti, their numbers now in excess of 20,000 and still 
climbing, have begun moving aggressively to disarm the organized bands of thugs 
who under the dictatorship of Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras have been allowed to 
conduct a reign of terror across the island nation. This risky business was not 
part of the original job description provided for the U.S. forces. It was 
instead supposed to be the Haitian police and military who would be chiefly 
responsible for disarming the so-called attaches and imposing some palpable 
sense of civic order. But the police and the military have little interest in 
the task. So now it's Americans who, in addition to trying to restore basic 
services and preside over a largely undefined "transition to peace," must 
disarm men who know that without their guns, they are fair game for a 
long-victimized populace that understandably despises them. 
</P>
<P>
 It's one more sign of dangerous mission creep for the U.S. troops, and yet in 
the rueful logic of the intervention it has also become unavoidable. Clearly 
there can be no hope of achieving calm and order while armed goons are left 
free to murder, rob and otherwise prey on their fellow citizens. Some of the 
leaders of these gangs were taken into custody over the weekend and on Monday 
and are being kept confined. The United States, as it keeps telling Haitians, 
is not an occupying force, so that pretty much leaves it without authority to 
prosecute or punish people who, under any reasonable system of justice, surely 
deserve prosecution and punishment. Exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is 
scheduled to return to Haiti around Oct. 15, the date by which Cedras and his 
fellow coup-makers are supposed to be out of office. The fate of the arrested 
attache leaders will be left up to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress, meanwhile, shows growing bipartisan apprehension about the mission 
of the U.S. troops in Haiti and the duration of their stay. Some want to set a 
deadline for withdrawal, with next March 1 most often mentioned. But arbitrary 
termination dates for any military operation are inherently dangerous and 
politically foolish. The message they send is that those against whom the 
mission is directed need only lie low before safely resuming their activities. 
Worse, as the U.S. commander in Haiti, Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton, has warned, an 
arbitrary withdrawal date jeopardizes lives by inviting attacks on U.S. troops 
in the final days and weeks of their presence. 
</P>
<P>
 In these circumstances it seems that the best course is to order the U.S. 
expeditionary force in Haiti to move as swiftly and vigorously as possible to 
eliminate the threat posed by armed opponents of civic order. The Clinton 
Administration's policy in Haiti, while it has seldom been less than ambiguous, 
does apparently aim at laying the groundwork for political and economic 
progress unhindered by authoritarian rule. Assuring public safety -- and that 
means disarming thugs and bringing the police and military under tight control 
-- remains the essential precondition for any progress. 
</P>
<P>
 We did not welcome the Haiti intervention. But now U.S. troops are there. They 
deserve to be supported and their orders should be clear and emphatic: Do 
what's needed to disarm the thugs, and give Haiti a chance to be free from 
terror.

EFFECTS OF PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prop. 187 would prevent children of illegal immigrants from attending our 
public schools. Those who think this will save us money are fooling themselves. 
The children who are excluded from our schools will still get an education. It 
will not be a formal education obtained in the schoolroom; instead it will be 
an education obtained on the streets, and the cost to us will be many times 
greater than the cost of letting those children go to our schools. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * It seems like the bleeding hearts that are against the proposition are 
looking at all the wrong reasons. It's not a matter of throwing thousands of 
illegal alien children out of school and onto the streets. It's a matter of 
disallowing any illegal aliens benefits they have no right to. It takes away 
the attraction to come to this country illegally. It puts pressure on the 
Mexican government to take care of its problems instead of exporting them to 
the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 As Jesse Laguna put it from his perspective as a Latino ("Latinos Want a 
Tighter Border, Too," Commentary, Sept. 23), if a person is in this country 
illegally, he is breaking the law. We can't feed, educate, and care for the 
entire world. 
</P>
<P>
 I say for all the bleeding hearts that are opposed to it, to put their money 
where their mouth is. Liquidate their entire net worth and spend it all on 
support and benefits for illegal immigrants. Only then would they have the 
right to beat their drum to demand that our government and our tax dollars do 
that.

 * I want to thank Kathleen Brown for giving Prop. 187 the perspective it 
deserves. My grandparents, legal residents of this state, were forbidden from 
buying property in their own name as late as the 1950s because of this state's 
exclusion laws. My father-in-law had to sign the deed so that his parents, my 
wife's grandparents, could buy a home. My own parents, along with all Japanese 
Americans in California, were "relocated" during World War II. Anyone who has 
lived in California for the last two and three generations knows that Prop. 187 
will not just affect the undocumented. It has the potential of hurting all 
people of color. How many of you have lost your birth certificate? How many of 
your children will be deemed "suspect" because of their color? Or their speech? 
Or anything that makes them stand out?

 Forget that Prop. 187 will throw 300,000 children out onto the streets to 
become legalized truants. (If their parents are working, these children will 
either be working with their parents or out on the street for the police to 
take care of.) Forget that Prop. 187 will cost us up to $15 billion in federal 
money for schools and MediCal. Forget that Prop. 187 does nothing to stop 
illegal aliens at the border or in the sweatshops. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember that Prop. 187 will punish innocent children for the sins of their 
parents. That is wrong. It reeks of the racism of the past. The aftershocks of 
this proposition could damage this society as badly as the Northridge 
earthquake.

 * Those of us who are against Prop. 187 should not spend time considering such 
issues as fair play, selfishness or mean-spiritedness but pragmatically 
remember the American immigrant experience. 
</P>
<P>
 It is risky to play shortsighted games with such a potential asset to our 
country. How sad that so many already documented immigrants, going back several 
generations, are willing to take such a chance.

 * Buried in The Times on Sept. 22 was an article headlined "Reno Rebuffs 
Wilson, Says State Hasn't Sought Immigration Funds." With the governor's 
reelection campaign coming to a conclusion, this piece deserved a more 
prominent placement. More important, if this sitting governor does not know 
that a special immigration fund was put in place in June and available to 
states applying for assistance, then Pete Wilson is negligent and does not 
deserve to be reelected.

 * Carlos Fuentes should know better. He should not stoop to political 
infighting, particularly when he refuses to speak correctly to the facts. In 
"Why Damn a Great State Resource?" (Commentary, Sept. 28) he has completely and 
purposely obfuscated the issue. He has used the one relevant word only once in 
his (approximately) 500-word article -- that being "illegal." And in so doing 
he very adroitly used it to defame Prop. 187, not as a modifier to the 
immigrants against whom the proposition is directed. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither does he excoriate his own country for failing to face the degrading 
issue of poverty and lack of self-sustaining jobs in Mexico as the reason for 
creating the problem in the United States. Please, Mr. Fuentes, stop bashing 
the elected officials of California and finally admit that there are two sides 
to every question.

HATE CRIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "The Outer Limits of Prosecution," editorial, Sept. 21: 
</P>
<P>
 The Times stated that "(hate-crime) cases can be difficult to prove." Thank 
goodness they are difficult to prove.It should be difficult to read the mind of 
a criminal to determine his or her motivation for committing a crime. Under the 
current "hate-crime" laws, if the perpetrator is thinking incorrect thoughts, 
such as bigotry, while committing a crime, then he will receive a stiffer 
sentence than if he were thinking thoughts such as greed, or revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hate-crime" laws don't punish the criminal act itself, as regular laws do. 
"Hate-crime" laws actually punish the motivation, the thought behind the crime. 
Therefore "hate crimes" are essentially "thought crimes." And it is frightening 
to think you can be prosecuted for not only the crime, but also your thoughts 
that were expressed during the crime. In other words, to kill for money is 
terrible, but to kill because of race or sexual preference is far worse. 
</P>
<P>
 We may abhor bigotry. We may believe it is dangerous, but the Constitution 
guarantees everyone the right to think the most hateful, bigoted thoughts 
imaginable for any reason, or no reason whatsoever. Those who would want to 
create their personal vision of tolerance at all costs have set themselves up 
as mind-readers, a lofty position for frail humans. All crimes committed 
against all people should be treated as equally deplorable, regardless of 
motivation.

PERSPECTIVE ON HAITI; FORCING A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL; INTERNATIONAL AID-GIVERS 
PUSH THE SAME OLD TOP-DOWN PLANS THAT HELP THE RICH AND ENSURE CONTINUED 
POVERTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA A. McGOWAN, Lisa A. McGowan is an economist in Washington with the 
Development GAP, which works with Third World citizen groups, the World Bank 
and the U.S. Agency for International Development. A former contractor to aid 
institutions in Haiti, she works with pro-democracy forces on Haitian 
development issues. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While the U.S. military occupies Haiti, a second, more powerful invasion force 
is close behind. Made up of economists, agriculturalists, lawyers and 
financiers, the stated mission of this army of so-called development experts is 
to restore economic viability and help alleviate poverty in Haiti. Yet their 
approach is likely to do little to address the root causes of poverty and 
instability in that country, if the plans presented by the international donors 
are any indication.  
</P>
<P>
 Three years of a military dictatorship have taken an extraordinary toll on the 
people of Haiti. Government services, never very effective, ceased to function 
soon after the coup. Road and irrigation systems are now a shambles. Productive 
inputs are unavailable to small farmers. Inflation is rampant and massive 
amounts of public funds have been stolen by the illegal government and its 
associates. 
</P>
<P>
 The targeted attacks by coup supporters on Haiti's vibrant grass-roots 
development community have also undermined the rural economy, where more than 
70% of Haitians make their living. The theft and destruction of credit-union 
funds, food-storage facilities, tree nurseries, tools, machinery and livestock 
-- not to mention the negative impact of the embargo and the fact that tens of 
thousands of people have been in hiding for three years -- have severely 
decapitalized both individual farms and social-change organizations that 
peasants painstakingly built to address the daunting economic and social 
challenges to their survival. 
</P>
<P>
 At an informal meeting on Haiti's economic future held in Paris at the end of 
August, Jean-Bertrand Aristide's constitutional government told international 
donors that it intended to include grass-roots cooperatives, women's groups, 
peasant associations, labor unions, business organizations and other key groups 
in civil society in the design and implementation of economic programs and 
policies. However, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World 
Bank, despite their rhetoric about the importance of democratizing development, 
are proceeding in typical top-down fashion and have yet to present any plans 
for including the Haitian people in determining what is best for their country. 
</P>
<P>
 The product of this top-down process, not surprisingly, is a $532-million 
development loan and assistance package that neglects the needs of the poor. 
For example, while small-farmers' organizations and other groups have called 
for strengthening peasant agriculture, the U.S. government and international 
finance institutions are promoting the creation of a "macroeconomic framework" 
that would do just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 Permitting only meager tariff protection for a handful of local food crops, 
import-liberalization policies pushed by donors promise to undermine local 
small-scale production while freeing rich Haitians to use scarce foreign 
exchange to purchase luxury goods. Furthermore, it appears that the bulk of 
donor technical assistance, investment and credit funds will be directed toward 
export agriculture and assembly industries -- most of the benefits of which 
accrue to only a handful of Haitians -- rather than to peasants, who make up 
the majority of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 Another major issue is the sub-poverty-level wage paid to workers. Minimum 
wage in Haiti has decreased from $3 a day in the mid-1980s to its current level 
of less than $1. Despite this decline, donors are not encouraging any official 
increase in the minimum wage, to date recommending only that the private sector 
voluntarily adjust wages to reflect increased costs of living. This is cause 
for alarm, since the private sector in Haiti has consistently and vehemently 
opposed any attempts to establish a livable minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
 As in so many other countries around the world, the international community is 
wielding development assistance like a sword in order to create social and 
economic structures that suit international, not local Haitian, interests. 
Donors cite the need for enforcing fiscal discipline as a rationale for their 
imposition. But, in the case of Haiti, this is unnecessary, as the Aristide 
government is already firmly committed to sound economic management, as it 
proved during its eight months in office in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is that the Haitian government is being forced into a pact with the 
devil. To obtain critically needed financing, it has accepted conditions that 
run counter to majority interests and that will stand in the way of an 
equitable resolution of Haiti's economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid further trauma and destabilization, the international community must 
stop imposing development strategies and economic frameworks. Rather, it should 
work with the constitutional government to put the Haitian people in the 
driver's seat. After all, that is what real democracy is all about.

COLUMN LEFT/ DONELLA H. MEADOWS: 300 M.P.G. IS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION; ALL THE 
TECHNOLOGY FOR A FUEL-EFFICIENT 'SUPERCAR' IS IN USE NOW, BUT IT WILL TAKE A 
NEW MIND-SET TO BRING IT TOGETHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By DONELLA H. MEADOWS, Donella H. Meadows is an adjunct professor of 
environmental studies at Dartmouth College.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago, with considerable fanfare, President Clinton entered into an 
agreement with the Big Three U.S. auto makers to develop within 10 years cars 
that can double or triple the 30 miles per gallon that the average new American 
car gets now. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, many auto companies have had for years demonstration models that get 
60 to 100 miles to the gallon. I used to listen with amazement when engineers 
claimed they could get 120 to 130 m.p.g. Then my friend Amory Lovins, the 
energy-efficiency guru of Rocky Mountain Institute, turned his attention from 
saving electricity to saving gas. He started talking about 150 miles per 
gallon. That number crept up to 200. Now he's confident of 300 m.p.g., he's 
done calculations that yield 600, and on his expansive days, he stuns his own 
staff by mentioning 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's not talking puny jazzed-up bicycles or high-tech jewels made of rare 
metals. He's talking safe, peppy, comfortable, quiet, beautiful, affordable 
family cars. They are, however, a wholly different kind of car. In today's most 
efficient cars, only 15% to 20% of the energy in the gas gets to the wheels. 
Only about 2% actually moves the driver; the rest hauls the ton of metal around 
the driver. Because of that ton of metal, engines have to be enormous. The key 
to the "supercar" is to make it much lighter and much more aerodynamic, which 
would then allow it to have a much smaller, more efficient engine. 
</P>
<P>
 The lightness comes from getting rid of the steel. The supercar will be made 
of composite materials -- carbon-fiber, fiberglass and plastic specially 
designed to absorb far more crash energy per pound than metal. You've watched 
these materials at work if you've ever seen an Indy-500 driver hit a wall at 
200 m.p.h. and walk away. Race cars are made of carbon-fiber. This material can 
be reclaimed and recycled and it doesn't rust. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovins estimates that cars could be made two to six times as slippery as they 
are now (in terms of energy lost to air drag) by, for instance, reducing the 
frontal area and making the underside as smooth as the top. A lighter, sleeker 
car can have a lighter suspension and needs to carry less fuel. It puts less 
weight on the tires, so it loses less energy to road friction. 
</P>
<P>
 The supercar engine will be "hybrid-electric." The hybrid-electric car will 
carry fuel to make its own electricity on board. It will recapture about 70% of 
the energy lost in braking by using a small battery or a flywheel, which can 
deliver extra push for acceleration and hill-climbing. Says Lovins, "With its 
power so boosted, the engine needs to handle only the average load, not the 
peak load, so it can shrink to about one-tenth the normal size. It would run 
very near its optimal point, doubling its efficiency, and turn off whenever 
it's not needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Such an engine could run on any fuel, from gasoline or natural gas to 
solar-generated hydrogen. Except for that last bit about hydrogen, none of 
these ideas -- composite body, advanced aerodynamics, hybrid-electric engine -- 
is impossibly futuristic. Each one is already in use somewhere. What's new is 
putting them together to reap their reinforcing benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination will revolutionize the automobile industry. Lovins envisions 
assembly plants that mold lightweight, easy-to-handle car pieces, combining in 
one step 10 to 100 parts that now have to be pounded out of steel and welded 
together. The pieces wouldn't have to be painted because the color could be 
added in the mold. The molds would be simpler and far less expensive than 
tool-steel dies. It would take weeks or months, not years, to change a design. 
Factories could be small and widely distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovins imagines buying a car the way he now buys a home computer, out of a 
catalogue, or after a demonstration of the options, making his choice and 
having the car delivered to his door two days later, freshly turned out in a 
local plant. 
</P>
<P>
 If you think the purpose of life is to maximize the gross national product, 
you might see the supercar as a disaster. It would certainly downsize the 
car-making, petroleum and steel industries. If, however, you understand that 
the GNP is the cost we pay to lead life, you'll rejoice. There can be nothing 
wrong with using less oil and steel, generating less pollution, mining and 
drilling less wilderness, transporting less material, being less dependent on 
imports, and not having to defend the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 No new technology solves every problem. Supercars won't unclog traffic jams or 
reduce the need to cover the land with asphalt. If that's what we want, we'll 
have to do even more advanced thinking.

 It wasn't Bob Dole as "Dr. Death" who killed health-care legislation this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 What really killed it almost guarantees it will never rise like a phoenix from 
its own ashes. Because we killed it -- we who comprise the teeming, suspicious 
middle class are just too jaded to support it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons couldn't rally us with inspiring words like sacrifice and cheaper 
since we have heard such words from employers for the past decade. And each 
time we did, we ended up paying more and getting less.  
</P>
<P>
 This is the greatest stomach-churning, "what-about-me?" issue to come along in 
a generation. Party affiliations play no role. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary and Bill should have attended more meetings where employers push 
cheaper health plans down the throats of their workers, meetings where even 
meek and passive employees breathe fire and talk homemade bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary should have asked all those small-business people she met, "What 
happens when you try to change health insurance? How do workers take to that?" 
She wouldn't be licking her wounds now, for they would surely have answered, 
"They take to it like ammonia takes to bleach. Our goal is to get out of the 
room alive." 
</P>
<P>
 No, it wasn't Republicans and insurance executives who killed health-care 
legislation. They only exploited our fears. 
</P>
<P>
 We killed the plan, we who see what increased efficiency and streamlining have 
already done to choice and common sense in health care. 
</P>
<P>
 We see it in open-enrollment meetings, at which insurance representatives say 
it's "logical" to pay for abortions and live births but not for birth-control 
pills, well-baby checks and vaccinations. 
</P>
<P>
 We see it when we call for hospitalization approval and the 19-year-old clerk 
currently in control of our life asks, "When the doctor said to get your son 
immediately to the hospital for meningitis, like did she do a test? Is this an 
emergency?" 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton just can't persuade us he can make health care better 
because we are too busy holding on to what we have, too terrified of losing it. 
</P>
<P>
 So, despite the fact that we hate this system, despite how sorry we are for 
the great number of "uninsured," we probably will kill his plan all over again 
next year.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOLLAR GAINS GROUND ON YEN; BOND YIELDS HIT 2-YEAR HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dollar rose Monday against leading currencies, briefly hitting the 
important psychological level of 100 Japanese yen for the first time in a month 
in the aftermath of a weekend trade accord between the United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Treasury bond yields rose to two-year highs and stocks 
closed mixed on word of an unexpected surge in factory activity and higher 
prices for raw materials, news that fanned investors' inflation fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trade deal was considered bullish for the dollar because it calmed the 
market's fears that there would be total breakdown of the talks," said David 
Durst, vice president at Bear Stearns & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 However, enthusiasm over the deal wore off early in the day, and the dollar 
ended with only moderate gains. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed in New York at 99.58 Japanese yen, up from Friday's 99.15 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
 Also blunting the dollar's advance beyond the key 100-yen level, market 
participants said, was heavy selling by Japanese manufacturing firms, which 
hold abundant stocks of the U.S. currency generated by their exports. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar also closed at 1.554 German marks, up from 1.552. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the yield on the bellwether 30-year bond pushed up to 
7.85%, the highest since June, 1992, and up from 7.81% on Friday. The long 
bond's price, which falls when rates rise, declined 7/16 point, or $4.38 per 
$1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile on Wall Street, blue-chip issues managed a slight recovery late in 
the session amid some optimism about third-quarter corporate earnings. At the 
close, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 3.70 points to 3,846.89. But 
declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 5 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond and stock prices fell from the early going after the National Assn. of 
Purchasing Management reported that its index of manufacturing growth rose to a 
six-year high of 58.2% in September from 56.2% a month earlier. An index 
reading above 50% indicates an expansion of activity at the nation's factories. 
</P>
<P>
 The association's price index, based on a survey of the prices manufacturers 
paid for materials, rose to 77.1%, the highest level since August, 1988, from 
74.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Both indexes ignited inflation fears in the market for fixed-interest 
securities, where traders and investors worry that their holdings will be 
eroded by rising prices in an expanding economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher commodities prices also reinforced the sense that inflation may be a 
problem as increases in precious metals prices lifted the Commodity Research 
Bureau's index of 21 commodity futures prices more than a point to 231.04. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Advanced Micro Devices fell 3 1/4 to 26 1/2 after the company said 
fourth-quarter profit could be hurt by falling chip prices and the cost of 
starting up two new factories. 
</P>
<P>
 Micron Technology fell 2 1/8 to 32 3/8 on concern at the prospect of falling 
prices for its four-megabit DRAM memory chips. Texas Instruments dropped 1 7/8 
to 66 1/8 and Intel fell 1 1/4 to 60 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * CareNetwork rose 13 1/8 to 24 after Humana said it would buy the company in 
a cash transaction valued at $123 million. Humana lost 1/2 to 23 1/8 in NYSE 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
 * Merck rose 7/8 to 36 1/2, Schering-Plough gained 1 to 72 and Warner-Lambert 
added 1 to 81 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Database company Information American gained 1 7/8 to 5 3/4 on news that it 
will be acquired by West Publishing, a private company, for $6 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks were mixed in overseas trading. London's Financial Times 100-share 
average fell 42.8 points to 2,983.5, while Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average 
gained 86.22 points to end at 19,650.03. The German bourse was closed for the 
German Unity Day Holiday and was to reopen today.

 "We're looking to upgrade the level of management at this company, and this is 
a really experienced guy," Gary L. Larkins, chief executive of House of 
Fabrics, said of Allen. "What makes him interesting to us is his recent 
experience in turnaround situations." 
</P>
<P>
 The struggling company recently announced plans to close 200 of its 624 stores 
and launched a plan to attract more customers by placing increased emphasis on 
crafts and home decorating supplies.

 Previously, Allen was chief financial officer of Dynascan Corp., a 
Chicago-based consumer electronics firm. He began his career with Arthur 
Andersen & Co. in 1966, and holds a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in 
business administration from Indiana University.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; TOUGH SENTENCE FOR A FOUL CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Public intolerance with violence has led to extreme responses like the 
"three-strikes" sentencing measure for felons, which requires prison terms of 
25 years to life and will lead to the costly warehousing of nonviolent 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week in Superior Court, a judge showed that the tools were already on 
hand, without extremist legislation, to throw the book at a 19-year-old Santa 
Ana man convicted by a jury of shooting into a crowd at the Westminster Mall 
and seriously wounding a 13-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting seemed to incorporate in one incident many of the outrages that 
have led to the public's exasperation. 
</P>
<P>
 According to prosecutors, Phong Thanh Dang fired at least four shots into a 
crowd of shoppers on July 8, 1993, motivated by the dubious grievance of a 
"hard look" from another group of young people. The girl, Phuong Nguyen paid 
for this imagined hurt with a bullet in the back, while another slug whizzed 
through the pant leg of a second girl. Nguyen, now 14, testified that the 
shooting had left her with emotional scars, and that she continued to have 
difficulty eating and sleeping. She said she was afraid to go to crowded 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Luis A. Cardenas promptly dismissed defense arguments that Dang should 
be retried on a less serious charge, and ordered the gunman to serve four 
consecutive life terms, the maximum allowable sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dang will not be eligible for parole for at least 64 years; prosecutors 
described the sentence as one of the harshest ever imposed in Orange County in 
a gang-related shooting that did not result in a fatality. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas did not stop there. He ordered Dang to serve an additional eight-year 
term even before the clock starts on his life sentences because he used a 
handgun and caused great bodily injury. He explained his tough sentence by 
saying, correctly, "It's this type of conduct that brings a community to the 
edge of anarchy." 
</P>
<P>
 The case illustrates that when it is serious about sending a message on 
violence, the criminal-justice system does have the means to put away for a 
long time those who place society at risk.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: CONGRESS SHOULD REAUTHORIZE AIDS RESOURCES LAW; ORANGE 
COUNTY HAS MORE THAN 3,000 CASES OF THE DISEASE AND ABOUT 8,800 PEOPLE WITH 
HIV. THE RYAN WHITE CARE ACT WOULD HELP PAY FOR THEIR SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEARL JEMISON-SMITH, Pearl Jemison-Smith chairs the Orange County HIV 
Planning Advisory Council.

<P>
 With the hopes for national health care reform lost this year, Congress should 
use what remains of the 1994 session to pass health-related legislation that 
addresses some of the most vulnerable groups in America. The Ryan White 
Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of 1990 (CARE Act) provides over 
$600 million in community-based health and social services for thousands of 
men, women and children living with AIDS and HIV. Congress should act now to 
reauthorize the CARE Act for a second five-year period, beginning in October, 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 With the rising cost of caring for the sick overwhelming state and local 
public health systems, the CARE Act was conceived as disaster relief for all 50 
states and 12 local communities that were disproportionately affected by the 
epidemic. As is often the case with other forms of disaster relief, Congress 
temporarily set aside its partisan interests, passing the CARE Act by a nearly 
unanimous vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, the need for the CARE Act continues to grow. While gay and 
bisexual men -- including men of color -- continue to be disproportionately 
affected by the disease, the numbers of infected women, heterosexual men, 
injection drug users and youth are increasing at startling rates. Moreover, 
though the nation's urban epicenters continue to experience the highest numbers 
and concentration of cases, HIV and AIDS are no longer unknown in suburban and 
rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has experienced its share, with more than 3,000 cases of AIDS, 
almost 2,000 deaths and an estimated 8,800 HIV-infected individuals. For the 
past two years we have received CARE Act funding. Unlike many other federal 
programs, the CARE Act provides for local control and rapid release of funds, 
low administrative overhead and insists on community input and grass-roots 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Through its support of community-based health and social services, including 
preventive AIDS drugs and therapies, the CARE Act prevents unnecessary and 
costly hospitalizations. Its decentralized planning model recognizes that the 
HIV epidemic in the United States is really a combination of many local 
epidemics, each with its own unique face and service needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The CARE Act was named after Ryan White, a young boy from Indiana who, before 
his death, inspired us with his tremendous courage and determination in the 
face of ignorance and fear on the part of his schoolmates and neighbors. Today, 
Ryan White's courage in the face of discrimination is experienced daily by 
thousands of gay and bisexual men and women and injection drug users who live 
with this disease and refuse to be silent or invisible. While the nation waits 
for truly meaningful reform of the nation's health care system, Congress should 
act now to reauthorize the Ryan White CARE Act. 
</P>
<P>
 I just returned from Washington, where I shared with Orange County legislators 
how essential this funding is to their constituents. I hope and pray that 
politics and party lines can be put aside and we can see a bipartisan effort 
for the expedited reauthorization of the Ryan White CARE Act.

PROPERTY VALUES: 60% OF FIRST-TIME HOME BUYERS SAID TO RELY ON FAMILY HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ron Galperin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tony and Judy Pribyl both hold down good jobs, but like many young couples 
they had trouble saving enough money for a down payment on their first home. 
The Pribyls decided to finally take Judy's parents up on their offer to give 
them the money needed to make a down payment. About a month ago, the Pribyls 
and their 4-year-old daughter moved into a residence they purchased for 
$176,000 in Ventura. Tony and Judy were able to get a loan from Home Savings of 
America with just 5% down -- and all of that came from Judy's parents. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 60% of first-time home buyers get some sort of help from their 
parents or grandparents, estimated Patti Kaiser, vice president and district 
sales manager at California Federal Bank's Reseda loan office. Without family 
assistance, she said, many first-time buyers wouldn't be buying at all. Help 
from family generally comes in the form of a gift of funds toward a down 
payment or help in securing a loan with a co-signature. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members who make a gift of funds for a down payment will generally be 
required by a lender to sign a gift letter stating that they don't expect the 
money back. Lenders don't want customers who are also borrowing their down 
payment. Lenders also generally require that part of the down payment come from 
the borrower's own savings (the Home Savings of America program is an 
exception). Most loans with a 5% down payment, for example, will generally 
require that three-fifths of that down payment come from borrower savings. The 
rest can be a gift. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders prefer that most or all of a down payment come from the borrower. 
Lenders look for so-called seasoned funds, explained Ann Carlton Bose, 
president both of Estate Funding Inc. in Woodland Hills and the California 
Assn. of Mortgage Brokers' L.A. County chapter. If the down payment money has 
been in the borrower's account for three months prior to the loan, then it is 
considered seasoned. Individuals can make annual gifts of $10,000 to as many 
people as they want without triggering any gift tax consequences. Some 
borrowers avoid telling lenders that any of their down payment was a gift by 
simply getting any gift money from their family at least 90 days before 
applying for a loan. This also is a way for family members to circumvent lender 
requirements that they sign a gift letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders don't like being fooled, of course. Some lenders may ask where the 
down payment really came from if they see that the borrower's tax returns don't 
reflect any significant interest or dividend income. Sometimes, lenders will 
ask for up to one year's worth of bank statements to be sure that the down 
payment wasn't all a gift, but that's pretty rare, say local lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Another way that parents, grandparents or your rich uncle can help you buy a 
house is by co-signing on a loan. Even with a co-signer, most lenders will 
require that the person planning to occupy the dwelling qualify for at least 
half the mortgage payment on their own, said Bose. If all the loan signers will 
be living under one roof, though, lenders will just total up all the assets and 
income of the would-be borrowers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents are often reluctant to co-sign on a loan for their children, Bose 
said. That's because parents don't want to find their credit hurt if their 
children make late mortgage payments or don't pay at all. Also, lenders will 
almost never remove the name of a co-signer from a loan without refinancing. 
Some children don't want their parents as co-signers because that means the 
parents are co-owners and their names will appear on the loan and on the deed 
of trust. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a very few generous and well-healed parents and grandparents who buy 
a house outright for their children. If the children make monthly payments to 
the parents, that income has to be reported by the parents to the IRS and the 
state Franchise Tax Board. The parents can also expect to pay a higher rate of 
interest on a loan they take out for a home that they aren't personally 
occupying. Finally, buying a home for the children won't help build their 
credit history. 
</P>
<P>
 A gift of money for a down payment remains the most popular way for family 
members to help each other out when it comes time to buy a home. Many buyers 
are getting help from family, said Clifford Collins, national director of sales 
for Home Savings of America in Irwindale. It used to be that only first-time 
buyers solicited help from family members. Now, he said, many move-up buyers 
are doing the same because all the equity in the first or second home has been 
erased by tumbling real estate prices. 
</P>
<P>
 While Home Savings does offer a 5% down "Easy Start" loan where all the money 
can come from family, the borrower must have very good credit. Home Savings 
additionally requires the borrower to have a reserve of at least two months 
worth of PITI -- principal, interest, taxes and insurance. It should also be 
noted that all of Home Savings' other loans require borrowers to ostensibly 
come up with some of their own money for a down payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers can employ all sorts of strategies when they don't have much money for 
a down payment and when parents can't or won't help. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans can qualify for Veterans Administration-backed loans of up to about 
$184,000 with basically no down payment at all. A certificate of eligibility 
from the VA is required. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Fannie Mae has programs available that allow a borrower to put 3% 
down and get a loan of up to $203,150. Another 2% of the down payment can come 
from family. Even the lender can kick in the needed 2% by charging a higher 
interest rate over the course of the loan and essentially refunding 2% of the 
purchase price to the borrower for part of the down payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers can also shop for developers who are offering special low- or no-down 
payment programs, or sellers who no longer have equity in their homes and need 
to sell. Take, for example, a house purchased in 1990 for $200,000 with a 
$160,000 loan. In the latter case, a savvy buyer might offer to just take over 
the owner's payments. While most residential loans have what's known as a "due 
on sale" clause, many lenders are happy to have anyone in the home who can pay 
the mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 The buyer and seller can create an AITD -- all-inclusive trust deed -- whereby 
the seller still remains officially responsible for the original loan. These 
AITDs, also known as wrap-around loans, can run afoul with some lenders who do 
insist at some point in enforcing the due on sale clause which requires 
borrowers to pay off a loan when the property is sold. Some sellers are also 
wary of just letting a buyer take over payments when the seller still remains 
liable for a default by the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Some buyers unfortunately resort to less than scrupulous tactics to get a 
low-down loan. These buyers inflate the sales price of a home while striking a 
secret deal with the seller to take back a second mortgage. A $160,000 sale 
might be represented to the lender as a $200,000 deal. The lender then makes a 
$160,000 loan with a $40,000 down payment. The only problem is that the $40,000 
is coming from an under-the-table loan made by the seller. This type of deal is 
neither ethical nor legal. Buyers can, however, get sellers to raise the price 
of a home and then pay for all non-recurring closing costs. This helps buyers 
get a slightly bigger loan and pay for up-front costs over the term of the 
loan.

THE WEEK AHEAD: VIENNA; EYE ON THE RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Austrians vote Sunday in federal elections closely watched by nervous Central 
European neighbors as a barometer on the rising right.Populist Joerg Haider and 
his archconservative Freedom Party are expected to boost their parliamentary 
share to at least 20% on the strength of a campaign that has stirred up 
resentment of foreigners in Austria. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling coalition that pairs the Social Democrats of Chancellor Franz 
Vranitzky with the center-right Austrian People's Party is expected to maintain 
its collective majority and control of the government. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the charismatic Haider and his party poll as strongly as forecasts 
indicate, the coalition will be increasingly compelled to heed the voice of the 
far right.

 Willie and Xenia Miles have lived across from the White House for six months 
now. When drug addicts overran the abandoned house they had squatted in, the 
fast-food cook and his pregnant wife took up residence under a flowering 
magnolia in historic Lafayette Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shelters would have split us up. Besides, stealing in most of them is 
something terrible," Willie Miles said as they shared a cola crackers for 
breakfast. Sleeping on coarse gray blankets, their belongings in plastic bags 
beside the tree, the Mileses said they feel less vulnerable in the open. 
</P>
<P>
 In the capital of the world's most powerful nation, pockets of homelessness 
are now pervasive. The Mileses are among about 50 people who sleep on the 
park's benches and under its maples, willows and magnolias, according to the 
National Park Service. Hundreds more sleep around the Washington and Lincoln 
monuments, in the shadow of the Capitol and on the warming sidewalk grates 
outside the departments of Justice, Commerce and State. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere between 7,500 and 10,000 people are homeless in Washington -- up 
from about 400 two decades ago, community groups report. About a third sleep in 
the open year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 But Washington is not unique. From Stockholm and Sydney to Tokyo and Toronto, 
the capitals and commercial centers of virtually every wealthy, industrialized 
country have experienced an unprecedented surge in homelessness since the late 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with hunger, homelessness is now one of the two main social problems of 
the West, a trend all the more damning because the resources are available to 
prevent it, economists contend. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, many homeless in the wealthy nations of Europe, North America, Japan 
and Australia live as roughly as their Third World counterparts. And in the 
industrialized states of Eastern Europe, the new capitalism has put hundreds of 
thousands on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most extreme manifestation of the marginality and social exclusion in the 
midst of affluence and economic growth is the phenomenon of homelessness, which 
is found to exist to differing degrees in all developed countries and is 
growing at worrying rates," warns an upcoming report by the Organization of 
Economic Cooperation and Development, whose members are 24 of the world's 
wealthiest nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Once limited to a tiny fringe of society, the homeless have reached staggering 
numbers at the end of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the European Union's 12 member-states, at least 2.5 million people are 
homeless, and the total probably exceeds 5 million, reports the European 
Federation of National Organizations Working with the Homeless.  
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, the number of "absolute homeless" is conservatively 
estimated at 600,000 at any given time, with as many as 7 million homeless over 
any five-year period, reports Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry 
Cisneros. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeless are now visible throughout the developed world -- around the 
heating vents of shopping malls in chilly Canada, in the subterranean world of 
the Paris Metro, under Budapest's bridges and in Warsaw's parks, in cardboard 
boxes close by the glass-and-concrete high-rises of Tokyo's financial center, 
and near abandoned factories in Sydney and Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
 The story is not, however, just in the growing numbers and haunting 
conditions. As Willie and Xenia Miles indicate, the profile of the homeless is 
rapidly changing. 
</P>
<P>
 Once largely alcoholics, drug addicts or mentally impaired, the legions of the 
homeless are increasingly women and children, even whole families. Up to a 
third have jobs but cannot afford shelter, experts say. And the average age is 
declining. In Europe, as many as 70% of the homeless are younger than 20. In 
Canada, where homelessness has doubled in 10 years, 25% of the quarter of a 
million homeless are children, the National Anti-Poverty Organization in Ottawa 
claims.  
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, there was a pool of itinerant cheap labor that was variously 
called hobos, drifters or vagrants. It was perceived to remain homeless by 
choice," the OECD report says. "The current homeless, which do not fit this 
stereotype, are heterogeneous, consisting of a number of groups who, unable to 
operate at the margins of the economic, social and residential life of the 
city, become victims of 'the new poverty.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Willie Miles, who recently got a job at a fried chicken restaurant, is a case 
in point. Paid minimum wage, he says it will be a long time before he can 
afford the first and last month's rent, plus security deposit, for rental 
housing. Until they have enough, the Mileses say, they'll stay in Lafayette 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The "new poverty" has multiple causes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current crisis is due to policies that ignored or misdiagnosed changes in 
housing affordability, the adverse impact of economic shifts around the world, 
increased drug use and the rising cost of health care," said Marsha Martin, 
executive director of Washington's Interagency Council on the Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Add to that changes in family structures and the breakdown in traditional 
social institutions. Meanwhile, community groups, charities and churches are 
strapped for money. They can no longer deal with the same numbers, much less 
with more." Problem 1: Housing Squeeze 
</P>
<P>
 Europe illustrates the first problem of supply and demand. Homelessness has 
soared as governments move away from subsidized housing and other social 
welfare benefits. Germany, with over a million, has the most homeless in 
Europe, followed by Britain's 700,000 and France's 600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of tighter budgets, public housing construction in Britain fell from 
180,000 units in 1975 to less than 20,000 in 1992. And the private sector has 
not made up the difference. The result is a growing shortage of affordable 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who hasn't been here in five years would be shocked at the increase in 
homelessness," said Katrina Dunbar, spokeswoman for Shelter, Britain's main 
lobbying group for the homeless. "The government is so embarrassed that it 
recently spent money for hostels to get people off London streets so tourism 
won't be affected. . . . Tuberculosis has come back in this country, first 
among the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of London's homeless live no better than they did in the 19th-Century 
days of Charles Dickens' "Oliver Twist," when survival depended on begging 
bowls, back-alley squatting and charity soup kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
 Although an increasingly large body of people, the homeless have few political 
advocates. Like the growing number of panhandlers on the streets of wealthy 
countries, homelessness is an issue the public and the policy-makers often 
prefer to ignore, experts say. Problem 2: Uneven Wealth  
</P>
<P>
 Canada reflects the second problem: national wealth not trickling down to 
adequately cover society's poorest. This year, the United Nations reported that 
Canada has the world's highest standard of living. But better economic times 
have not helped the homeless. In Canada and throughout the industrialized West, 
the social contract between the state and the people is being redefined as key 
benefits are eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a bizarre economic situation where growth has not been combined with 
a lot more jobs," said Francois Dumain, assistant director of Canada's National 
Anti-Poverty Program. He cited a Canadian oil company that recently announced a 
record profit -- and a simultaneous layoff of 500 employees to maintain that 
trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "That says a lot about the future we face. The goal is performance without 
social values," Dumain added. "We face the same pattern as the United States. 
In many cases, those laid off because of cutbacks are forced to take poorly 
paid part-time jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, social programs the poor once fell back on -- welfare, 
unemployment insurance, health and family benefits -- have been cut. So more 
people are falling through the safety net and ending up on the streets. Problem 
3: Social Malaise 
</P>
<P>
 Australia symbolizes a third and broader problem: social problems making the 
young, from tots to teen-agers, increasingly vulnerable. Sparsely populated 
Australia has 20,000 homeless under age 24 on the streets, according to Leith 
Greenslade, an official of the Ministry of Housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The three major causes include changing family structures, such as 
single-parent families; violent environments or physical abuse, and inability 
to make it on their own. Among Australians aged 18 to 24, unemployment is 20%, 
double the national rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Worldwide, up to 100 million children are homeless, depending on the 
definition, the World Health Organization says. Homeless children are so 
abundant they have nicknames, such as scugnizzi or "spinning tops" in Italy and 
bomzh , the acronym for "no fixed abode," in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The young also have the hardest time re-integrating. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dropout rate from school is high, and many are drawn to drug or alcohol 
abuse, glue sniffing, prostitution or even suicide. Many runaways, or 
'throwaways,' tire of moving from one foster group to another and are 
distrustful of public institutions. They adopt a transient lifestyle and have 
no opportunities to learn basic skills," the OECD report notes. Problem 4: 
Communism's End 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern Europe illustrates the fourth and newest cause of homelessness in 
industrialized nations: the end of communism. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Soviet Empire's demise in 1991, up to 60,000 have become homeless in 
Moscow alone because of new poverty, no new housing and the absence of a permit 
required to live in the Russian capital. Within a year, so many took refuge in 
Moscow's biggest train station that foreign doctors set up a clinic there. 
</P>
<P>
 President Boris N. Yeltsin subsequently signed a decree making homelessness a 
crime, reviving a Communist law. But the shelters he ordered built to house the 
homeless have yet to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern Europe also faces a potentially explosive increase in homelessness. In 
Hungary, more than 4 million people live in substandard housing, frequently 
without running water or electricity, for which Hungarians pay up to 
three-quarters of their income in rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Begin with a situation in which it's common to find three generations sharing 
500 square feet in old, neglected buildings owned by the state. Then factor in 
a complete change in the patterns of work and a lot of unemployment -- and that 
nothing is guaranteed any more," said Kalman Lorincz, director of Hungary's new 
Habitat for Humanity office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have private construction firms, but when you need 150% collateral for a 
mortgage and you pay up to 30% interest, who has the money to build? This is 
fairly typical in all Eastern Europe. Four years is not enough to learn what to 
do with freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 In Poland, the symbols of the new capitalism are also often the symbols of the 
new homelessness. Many without shelter sleep and beg among the newly privatized 
restaurants and chic shops. Poland has a chronic "under-housing" crisis, with a 
million fewer units than it needs for a population of 38 million people, the 
U.S. Agency for International Development reports. The waiting list for 
apartments is years, even decades, long. Young couples may have to live well 
into their 40s with parents; some can only hope to have their own place by 
inheriting it. 
</P>
<P>
 Poland also suffers from post-Communist "pauperization," according to Adam 
Krol, chairman of Poland's Habitat for Humanity. The new paupers in Eastern 
Europe have lost jobs as state industries are privatized, streamlined or go 
bankrupt in new capitalist economies. 
</P>
<P>
 In rural villages, others have been forced to abandon farming because state 
markets and subsidies are no longer guaranteed. And old people, after a 
lifetime of work, are finding their pensions almost worthless in the 
post-socialist economies. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the reality is that in both East and West, homelessness should not be a 
major problem. In virtually every city in the developed world, vacancy rates 
are high enough to accommodate all those who are without shelter -- usually 
many times over, according to Steve Mayo, a World Bank expert. 
</P>
<P>
 In U.S. cities, the vacancy rate is about 7%, while "absolute homelessness" is 
less than 1%. The problem is that even shabby housing is increasingly 
unaffordable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very often in the United States, the poor are spending 40% or 50% of their 
incomes on rent for something not necessarily safe. Given other demands on 
limited budgets, many can't or choose not to spend the money on housing," Mayo 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, policy on homelessness in the wealthy West was characterized by 
the stick of vagrancy laws and the carrot of charity. Either way, the homeless 
were usually marginalized; prospects for re-integrating into society were 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
 "The single most common pattern within the European Union is to treat 
homelessness as a condition to be avoided for the sake of the public good 
rather than in terms of individual rights," reports the 1994 survey of FEANTSA, 
the European federation dealing with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgium still penalizes vagrancy based on an 1891 law, while Luxembourg 
homeless face a Catch-22: a shortage of subsidized housing makes it 
inaccessible to the homeless. Yet without an address, applicants often can't 
qualify for minimum welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, where the problem first appeared in 1989, police patrols daily 
destroy makeshift homes of the more than 2,000 homeless in Tokyo, Osaka and 
Yokohama. Some Solutions 
</P>
<P>
 Homelessness is proving a stubborn problem. Nevertheless, a few governments 
and private groups have launched initiatives: 
</P>
<P>
 * Denmark has an early warning system, whereby social service agencies must be 
notified before a family with children is evicted. Municipal authorities are 
also are empowered to take over every fourth apartment that becomes vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 * France has codified the rights of people to housing. And 1990 legislation 
mandated three types of help for the destitute, including a minimum income, 
training and housing. 
</P>
<P>
 * In British Columbia, community groups founded ASK, or Assn. for Street Kids, 
to provide housing referrals, training and counseling. Many in turn helped work 
with their peers still on the streets. U.S.-based Habitat for Humanity 
organizes volunteers to work with the needy, who put in hours of "sweat equity" 
on their homes and others as collateral. At least 30,000 homes have been built 
in 42 countries since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 1994 National Teacher of the Year, Sandra McBrayer, was selected for her 
work with homeless children in San Diego, where up to 1,500 children live on 
city streets. McBrayer founded an outreach school in a storefront in 1988. With 
a staff of 12 and a van that picks up children on strategic street corners, the 
school now serves up to 400 students aged 12 to 19 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the most original solutions to homelessness, the First World may learn 
most from the Third World, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within the housing world, we've come to recognize survival strategies of the 
south will be very useful in the north," said Ruth McLeod, executive director 
of Homeless International in England. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people can't get formal housing in Nairobi, for example, they squat or 
build illegally. There's a growing recognition that that kind of housing has to 
be tolerated. Because the private sector and governments are unable to provide 
adequate housing, creativity and energy of people needs to be supported as 
homelessness becomes a bigger issue everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Third World concepts being explored is "planned squatting," or laying 
out land for people to squat in an organized way so, when resources are 
available, utilities and services can be added or upgraded. Over time, outlying 
squatters areas can then be developed into proper suburbs -- a common approach 
now in Brazil, planners say. 
</P>
<P>
 Another idea is "land sharing," a practice worked out between landowners and 
squatters in Bangkok. Owners install sanitation and other facilities on part of 
the land in exchange for squatters moving off front areas so they can be 
developed for commercial use -- a concept now being explored by European 
housing groups. 
</P>
<P>
 A third idea helps create new funding for the homeless without collateral for 
loans. In India and Bangladesh, "women's savings groups" pool resources and 
lend money to each other at low interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I recently took some British housing executives to India to show how it 
worked," said McLeod, the British homeless official. "An executive from 
Cambridge said it was a model to use in his area, as he knows families paying 
loan sharks 300% interest a year because they have no access to the British 
banking system." Getting Organized  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the homeless are also mobilizing worldwide to help themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Squatters' Rights Handbook" was published in London in 1987 for homeless 
who have found shelter in abandoned facilities. South Africa's People's 
Dialogue on Land and Shelter, which groups 130 grass-roots organizations, has 
conducted exchanges with the National Slumdwellers of India. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the largest shelter is the John L. Young Center. The government 
provided the building, and the city pays utilities. But it is staffed by the 
homeless and it nightly puts up 1,400 men, women and children. Keith Mitchell, 
a director, became the first homeless person to win a local election. This 
fall, he is running to be Washington's shadow representative to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're part of the new idea that people should take power over their own 
lives and homesteads. Instead of seeing them as desperate and living wherever 
they can, they're seen as taking action on their own and forming their own 
tenants groups and trying to put a semblance of order to a disorderly issue -- 
an idea borrowed from the developing world," said Irene Glasser, American 
author of "Homelessness in Global Perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 "The new theory tries to give the problem a positive cast: They're not 
squatters. They're part of spontaneous developments. Give them a chance and 
you'll see they will better their lives."

 * Who are they? 
</P>
<P>
 Homelessness comes in many categories. 
</P>
<P>
 Absolute homelessness -- People without their own addresses, phones or 
paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheltered homeless -- A much larger category that includes those put up in 
government shelters or charity hostels. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidden homeless -- An even larger category that includes people forced out of 
housing who move in with friends, several generations living in a facility 
built for a single family and women who find temporary alternatives after 
fleeing abusive homes with their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Shadow housing -- Basically, squatters who move into abandoned homes. They are 
increasing in the developed world, sometimes setting up underground management 
that taps into local electricity lines and even rents apartments.

THE OLD LUSTER TO THE FAMED BOULEVARD.

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the police swooped down on the Avenue des Champs Elysees five years ago, 
the magnificent artery that had catered to Paris high society, borne the 
remains of Napoleon, and thundered with the tanks of Nazi occupiers and Allied 
liberators was a sad sight indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkers ruled the narrow sidewalks, traffic clogged the side roads, neon 
lights flashed from the buildings, beggars mingled with the crowds and 
pickpockets roamed with abandon. The street was still a magnet for Parisians as 
well as foreigners. But, to many, greed and profit seemed to have supplanted 
taste and civility. 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks, the police drove the hawkers away, confiscating everything from 
balloons and chestnuts to lithographs and soft drinks. And the street cleaning, 
as it turned out, was the beginning of a long climb back to respectability for 
the Parisian thoroughfare, which received its name 285 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, after a $45-million face-lift, Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac dedicated 
the new look, saying the street had regained its prestige and, more 
importantly, reclaimed "the magical character which it had in the subconscious 
of the French and of foreigners." 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to give the Champs Elysees the luster of old," Chirac added. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the rebuilding project, which works out to about $8,000 for each 
foot of the 1.1-mile-long avenue, has made the Champs Elysees more 
user-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are the parallel access roads, paved over in gray, blue and white to form 
60-foot wide sidewalks from the Rond-Point to the Arc de Triomphe. Those 
sidewalks, traversed by 200,000 people on weekdays and 300,000 on weekends, 
have been specially treated to make them resistant to oil stains and sticky 
chewing gum. And a new 850-space parking garage has been built underground. 
</P>
<P>
 A second row of plane trees, 227 of them, has been planted along the street, 
and strollers can park themselves on 51 new benches, made of dark tropical wood 
at a cost of $4,000 apiece. The bus shelters, telephone booths, newspaper 
kiosks and street lamps have been artfully redesigned, in cast iron, glass and 
stainless steel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is just extraordinary," said Maurice Casanova, the owner of Fouquet's, the 
last remaining Belle Epoque-style restaurant on the avenue. "It's remarkable 
what has been accomplished. There are large pavements with no cars. There is 
space again for the people." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Lido, where mostly foreign customers take in the cabaret reviews while 
guzzling 800 bottles of Champagne a night, spokesman Bernard Etienne gushed: 
"It's fabulous. It's going to attract more tourists, and this will restore our 
international reputation. The Champs Elysees is again the show window of 
Paris." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is pleased with the overhaul, of course. This is Paris, after 
all, where changes in the city scape are hotly debated among everyone from the 
bricklayers to the intellectuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Some strollers complain about the lack of flowers, for example. Other critics 
think the architectural styles clash. And still others say a country with more 
than 3 million people out of work could find better ways to spend so much tax 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Le Monde, the daily newspaper of intellectuals, welcomed the broad pedestrian 
walkways, "which recall the avenue's original role as a promenade." But it 
contends that the project is "distorted" by an attempt to please all tastes. 
Modern benches and replicas of Old Paris street lamps, for example, create a 
jarring mix, it says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not to choose was the worst choice of all," Le Monde said. "Each style is 
canceled out in a visual jumble." 
</P>
<P>
 Even supporters of the project agree that there is still more to do. 
</P>
<P>
 The root of the Champs Elysees' problem is not the sidewalks or the street 
itself, but rather the shops and businesses that have sprung up along it in the 
last two decades. In the 1960s, Gen. Charles de Gaulle described the street 
satirically as "the most beautiful avenue in the world, if you disregard the 
buildings that line it." 
</P>
<P>
 Long gone are the grand hotels, the haute couture shops and fancy restaurants 
that gave the street its special character in the 19th Century and well into 
this century. Gone too are the graceful townhomes and many of the cafes where 
Marcel Proust and others used to hang out. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been gutted for chrome-and-glass shopping malls, video-game arcades, 
automobile show windows, and fast-food restaurants, including a Burger King and 
a 400-seat McDonald's restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there is a new, two-story branch of the Disney Store and a three-story 
Virgin Megastore. The street is also lined with no fewer than 55 banks and 46 
movie screens, which advertise mostly American films. 
</P>
<P>
 High society no longer promenades on the Champs Elysees, and the smart set of 
young French professionals, the type of people who read Le Monde, avoid it as 
well. They've been replaced by camera-lugging tourists; les dragueurs , young 
men and women from the working-class suburbs on the prowl for each other and 
Monsieur Tout le Monde , Mr. Everyman. Hundreds of thousands of ordinary 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 While it may no longer be a chic avenue, Napoleon's "triumphal way" has become 
a people's avenue. What the street has lost in aristocracy, it has gained, 
tenfold, in democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving away the street peddlers, adding police patrols to curtail petty crime 
and widening the pedestrian walkways has transformed "the boulevard of the 
unwashed and tasteless," as Time magazine once described it, and paved the way 
for even greater changes, in the view of some merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been the first big step in the right direction," said Casanova of 
Fouquet's. "And I think the rest will follow. Shop owners will realize that 
they don't have the right to denature the beauty of what has been done." 
</P>
<P>
 The urge to turn the Champs Elysees into a museum is understandable, given its 
rich heritage. It begins at the Place de la Concorde, where the 3,300-year-old 
obelisk from the Temple of Luxor was installed 1 1/2 centuries ago, and 
continues to the 162-foot-tall Arc de Triomphe, commissioned by Napoleon in 
1806 to honor his soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Being 200 feet wide, and flanked by buildings under the 79-foot Paris height 
limit, the Champs Elysees is tailor-made for parades. In 1840, Napoleon's 
casket was pulled along the avenue by a single white horse. And Allied troops 
marched there to celebrate the end of World Wars I and II. 
</P>
<P>
 It has also been an emotional center of the city, a magnet in times of crisis 
and celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The area was only fields and marshlands in the early 17th Century when Marie 
de Medici, wife of King Henry IV, turned it into a royal, tree-lined carriage 
path. In 1706, the shaded avenue was named the Champs Elysees, which means 
Elysian Fields, a reference, from ancient Greece, to the place at the end of 
the earth where those favored by the gods can find perfect happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 A succession of kings improved the route, which was notoriously dusty, and, in 
1807, Napoleon invited 10,000 men for a feast at tables arranged there. It was 
under Emperor Napoleon III, in the mid-19th Century, that the avenue blossomed, 
becoming a key part of the cityscape envisioned by the renowned urban planner, 
Baron Georges Eugene Haussmann. 
</P>
<P>
 From the 1800s into the early part of this century, the avenue drew the 
fanciest shops and was a showcase of mansions. Arriving in horse-drawn 
carriages, elegant Parisians stopped to listen to cafe orchestras and danced to 
polkas in the streets. But the avenue's commercial success in the 20th Century 
also became, in a way, responsible for the changes that are now lamented. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s and early 1980s, many of the French owners of the avenue's 
buildings sold out to foreign businesses. Today it is estimated that more than 
60% of the structures are owned by foreigners from the oil-rich Persian Gulf, 
the United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The genesis of the street's latest make-over was a threat to evict Fouquet's, 
made by the profit-minded absentee Kuwaiti owners of the building that houses 
the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant's owner, Casanova, gathered supporters from his famous

declaring the restaurant a national monument part of the French heritage that 
must be protected in perpetuity.

 These days, the avenue has been completely turned over to the people, French

international and commercial soul.

 "The Champs Elysees," Mayor Chirac said, "is a prestigious and necessary

French savoir-faire."

THE WEEK AHEAD: NEW YORK; A U.N. MUST-HEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti addresses the U.N. General Assembly 
today and seems certain to attract one of the most attentive audiences of the 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers address 
the assembly every day during the annual general debate in a sometimes 
stupefying deluge of words.But everyone wants to hear what Aristide plans for 
his country when he returns there sometime later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide has spoken to the General Assembly twice before. In 1991, he 
addressed the general debate only a few days before a military coup ousted him 
from office. Although in exile in 1992, he addressed the General Assembly again 
as the U.N.-recognized Haitian leader. The Security Council has approved 
sending a U.N. peacekeeping force of 6,000 troops into Haiti next year to 
relieve the U.S. troops in the island nation now.

THE WEEK AHEAD: FRANKFURT; OLD FAIR, NEW MEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 46th Frankfurt Bookfair opens today with special emphasis on the world of 
multimedia and on Brazilian literature. 
</P>
<P>
 The new media -- electronic books, CD-ROM and videos -- made their debut at 
Frankfurt, the world's largest book fair, last year and will account for about 
220 of the 8,600 exhibits this week. 
</P>
<P>
 However, fair Director Peter Weidhass hastens to say that "with all the 
euphoria around the new media, the book will not lose its importance." 
Scheduled is a "Meeting With Culture" segment from Brazil, with 60 Brazilian 
authors leading discussions.

 Secretary of State Warren Christopher is scheduled to head for the Middle East 
on Sunday to continue his attempt to broker a peace treaty between the region's 
most implacable foes -- Israel and Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli and Syrian officials have not met face to face for months, so all 
negotiations are handled through U.S. mediators.

 Christopher plans to meet with both Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and

NEXT STEP; STANDING THEIR GROUND IN GOLAN; JEWISH SETTLERS LAUNCH A PROPAGANDA 
WAR AGAINST PROPOSALS TO RETURN ANY LAND TO SYRIA. THEY ACCUSE RABIN OF 
PREPARING TO BETRAY THEM. 
</P>

<P>
 Avi Pinkas moved to this small farming community 15 years ago, when it was 
made up of little more than a rock-strewn hillside and a handful of tiny, 
makeshift houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt at the forefront of the settlers' movement. We were encouraged by all 
the government agencies to come here," recalled the soft-spoken Pinkas, now 42. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he and the rest of the estimated 16,000 Israelis living in 33 
settlements on the Golan Heights are again at the fore. But this time, the 
settlers fear, they are about to become the first line of Israel's next 
withdrawal from territories it captured in the 1967 Mideast War. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golan settlers dread Secretary of State Warren Christopher's next 
scheduled visit to the region, due to begin Sunday Christopher is reported to 
be prepared to shuttle intensively between Jerusalem and Damascus, determined 
to narrow the still-substantial gaps between Israel's offer -- a phased, 
partial withdrawal from the Golan in exchange for normal relations with Syria 
-- and the demand by Damascus for an almost immediate full withdrawal in return 
for gradual normalization. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher is encouraged, both by signs that Syria is serious about making 
progress and by the increasingly bold statements that Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin and other Labor Party officials are making. Rabin and his 
colleagues now speak publicly, and often, about the need for Israel to make a 
"painfully deep" withdrawal from the strategic heights in exchange for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Rabin revealed that he has offered Syria a two-stage withdrawal 
from the Golan, trading an undefined amount of territory for a peace treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 His proposal was greeted with outrage and a vow to fight back from the people 
of the Golan. Golan settlers -- most of whom, like Pinkas, support Rabin and 
the Labor Party he heads -- say their way of life is about to be destroyed by a 
party they accuse of betraying not only them but also the values it has always 
represented. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you immigrate to Israel from a Western country, you are not running away 
from anything," said Marla Van Meter, a former resident of Santa Maria, Calif., 
who has lived in Kibbutz Afiq on the Golan for 11 years. "You come with a lot 
of ideology. When my husband and I went to the immigration desk in San 
Francisco and told them we wanted to move to the Golan, they said: 'What good 
Zionists!' It was always part of Labor ideology to spread Jews around the land 
of Israel." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Meter and her husband, Dennis, moved to Kibbutz Afiq when it was still a 
young settlement. She became the head gardener. He is in charge of the avocado 
orchards. Their daughter, named Kinnert -- Hebrew for the Sea of Galilee -- and 
their son, Golan, were born on the kibbutz. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only home my children have ever known," said Van Meter, 36, a 
wiry triathlon competitor. She said she volunteered to become a spokeswoman for 
Golan settlements because she was alarmed by the government's negotiations with 
Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does (Syrian President Hafez) Assad need this land for, to save face?" 
she asked, her voice rising in anger. 
</P>
<P>
 After Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War, 
young Israelis, steeped in the pioneering spirit of the center-left Labor 
Party, saw a chance to fulfill the Zionist dream of redeeming the land with 
none of the complications presented by the West Bank, Gaza Strip or Sinai 
Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Settlers who came to the Golan knew they were backed by a national consensus 
that security required Israel to keep that slice of southern Syria from which 
the enemy had rained shells on Israeli positions below. There were no 
Palestinians living on the plateau that separates northeast Israel from its 
most implacable foe, only Druze villagers in the far north. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those who settled the Golan were politically liberal. They say they 
have nothing in common with the right-wing settlers who have built homes in the 
West Bank. Golan settlers say they would never dream of violently opposing any 
government decision taken on the fate of the heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinkas, Van Meter and other Golan residents interviewed uniformly agreed that 
the time probably has come for Israel to pull out of the West Bank and that 
Rabin's decision to pull out of the Gaza Strip was a good decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was wrong to try to rule the lives of 1.5 million Arabs," Pinkas said. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the Golan, Van Meter insisted, "the human rights issue is the issue of 
the Jews who are living here. We displaced no one. We are the ones who will be 
displaced." 
</P>
<P>
 Pinkas and his wife, Rikki, invested years of back-breaking labor to transform 
their 12 rocky, sloping acres into a successful farm. Today, Pinkas greets 
guests in the four-bedroom home he built with his own hands. Each of his three 
children has a separate bedroom. Pinkas has planted vineyards and orchards and 
exports fruit to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 He has what few Israelis, crowded into the tiny nation's few large cities, can 
hope to own. He has land, and he has a breathtaking view of the Sea of Galilee, 
a profit-making farm and a spacious home. 
</P>
<P>
 So every day now, Pinkas fights a growing feeling of despair, a deepening fear 
that Rabin is preparing to trade it all away to Assad. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is for technocrats to talk about give and take," the farmer said, his 
voice quivering with emotion. "That's the way you talk with merchants -- 'You 
give me this, I give you that.' But we live here. We're not able to think in 
terms of a trade-off. It is not just a house. My children live in harmony with 
nature and their surroundings. We cannot see, in any situation, giving up our 
livelihood, our home, our love." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin's willingness to even consider at least a partial withdrawal from the 
Golan -- based on his growing belief that only by achieving a peace with Syria 
will there be peace in the region -- is almost inexplicable for Pinkas and 
other residents here. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1992 national election campaign, Rabin traveled to the heights and 
promised that Israel would never relinquish the land, not even in exchange for 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
 But in September, quelling a revolt within his own party, Rabin said that 
anyone who claims that Israel can achieve peace with Syria and keep the Golan 
"is uttering the biggest of all lies." 
</P>
<P>
 The people of the Golan have launched an all-out campaign to stop Rabin. They 
are mounting mass rallies, blitzing the country with placards and banners 
proclaiming that "The People Are With the Golan" and trying to mobilize support 
in the U.S. Congress among those reluctant to see U.S. troops become part of 
any Israeli-Syrian solution on the Golan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 11 Golan residents started a hunger strike that lasted 19 days, 
ending last Thursday after five Labor members of Parliament submitted a bill 
that would require a special majority of 70 in the 120-member body to approve 
any withdrawal from the Golan. The bill is not expected to pass, but its 
sponsorship by members of Rabin's own party underscores the opposition he is 
facing. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike generated a lot of publicity for the settlers. They say that 
thousands of Israelis visited the strikers to express their support for the 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most natural step for us to take," said Ilit Eitam, 42, one of 
the hunger strikers, while the strike was under way. Eitam, 10 other strikers 
and a dozen supporters sat under an awning at Gamla, an ancient site where 
historians believe a Jewish community committed mass suicide rather than 
surrender to Roman soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Eitam sat with fellow striker Efrat Badichi, 40. They are among the handful of 
religious settlers living on the Golan. Each moved to the Golan as a single 
woman, married and raised a family on the heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are protesting a government whose actions we believe are illogical and 
immoral," Badichi said.  
</P>
<P>
 Badichi and Eitam took part in a similar hunger strike a year and a half ago, 
they said. They believe that their protest helped pressure Rabin into promising 
that the government would make no decision on withdrawal from the Golan without 
putting the question to the nation in a referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, with some polls showing more and more Israelis willing to consider at 
least partial withdrawal in exchange for peace, Golan residents are not so 
willing to leave the issue to a referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 "A referendum is not fair," said Yitzhak Rahat, director of the Community 
Center at Bnei Yehuda, the regional hub for farming communities in the southern 
Golan. "The government has had two years to convince the people; we are 
starting from a disadvantage." 
</P>
<P>
 Rahat and his wife, Gloria, say they are still "in a state of denial," but 
they acknowledge that now, when they get together with friends, conversation is 
beginning to turn to the question of where people will go if the government 
actually does relinquish the heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still can't believe it," Gloria Rahat said. "In the evenings, I sit on our 
back porch and look up at the stars, and I just can't imagine myself anyplace 
else."

NATIONAL AGENDA; ISRAEL'S NEW INFLATION IMPERILS MORE THAN POCKETBOOKS; 
ECONOMIC PROBLEMS ARE DRAGGING DOWN THE GOVERNMENT'S PEACE OPTIONS. EARLY 
ELECTIONS TO WIN A POPULAR MANDATE COULD BE TOO RISKY NOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When zucchini shot up 28% in price in late summer, and tomatoes and cucumbers 
by 23%, Bank of Israel Gov. Jacob A. Frenkel knew that inflation was again out 
of hand and that he had to act. 
</P>
<P>
 Frenkel, who bitterly recalls how hyper-inflation nearly destroyed the Israeli 
economy a decade ago, hiked interest rates twice in the last month in an effort 
to curb the ascending prices. The inflation rate was running at nearly 15% a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of tighter money would be slower economic growth, probably less 
than 5% this year rather than the current 7.5%, but it would be healthier 
growth, Frenkel contended. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't buy growth with inflation," said Frenkel, a stalwart "Chicago 
school" monetarist and former official of the International Monetary Fund. 
"It's an extraordinary mistake to go for growth by accepting inflation. You 
will have less growth at the end, not more." 
</P>
<P>
 But in Israel, the political implications of such economic decisions are 
immense. The higher interest rates -- the prime rate is now 17%, compared to 
11% at the end of last year -- will mean slower business growth, fewer new jobs 
and perhaps even a recession after several boom years here. 
</P>
<P>
 And all this poses serious problems for a government that was elected in 1992 
as much for its pledges of more jobs, lower inflation and improved living 
standards as for its promises to make peace with Israel's Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, as a result, finds his options far narrower as 
he pursues talks with Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 With an economic downturn, Rabin will hesitate to call early elections to 
secure popular approval for the difficult compromises involved in negotiations 
with the Arabs, political insiders say, because Israelis could vote their 
pocketbooks, ousting Rabin's Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you add together those who oppose peace with the Palestinians and 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights to those who are angry over their economic 
situation, then we are in trouble," a key Rabin adviser said. "The polls 
already show it. . . . We have to pull together a peace package in the next 
year, but we also have to get the economy rightened in that time." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of elections, Rabin might choose to hold the referendum he has 
promised on any agreement with Syria that involves a substantial Israeli 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, according to these calculations. But that 
would leave him without the broadened mandate he wants for a final Palestinian 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 And if he waits until June, 1996, when parliamentary elections are required, 
he runs a variety of risks: loss of momentum in negotiations with Syria and the 
Palestinians, a deeper economic downturn and resurgence of the fragmented 
rightist opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 In the complex politics of Israel, the search for peace thus is tied to the 
price of vegetables, the shortage of housing and the creation of jobs as 
closely as it is to political agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 "This government seems so busy with the intricacies of separate peace 
negotiations with the PLO, Jordan and Syria that it is falling badly behind in 
the basics of economic management," said Michael Eilan, editor of the Israeli 
business magazine Link. 
</P>
<P>
 Although hesitant to criticize Rabin, banker Frenkel warned last month that 
"the Israeli economy is again at a crossroads" where fateful decisions will 
have to be made. "Inflation is the key challenge," he said, announcing the 
seventh increase in interest rates in 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 In its first year and a half, the Rabin government had not done badly. 
Unemployment dropped from a record 11.2% to 7.7%, inflation was almost halved 
and, at the end of 1993, the economy appeared set for long-term growth of 6% or 
more per year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the government had also pushed the Bank of Israel last year for lower 
interest rates and easier credit to stimulate economic growth and job creation 
in order to meet its campaign promises -- and bolster support for its 
still-controversial agreement on Palestinian self-government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted people to feel that peace paid," a former Rabin adviser said. "The 
political logic was very powerful. With business growth and especially new 
jobs, people would see that peace paid in their own lives. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Problems, however, piled up quickly. A sharp 35% decline in stock prices left 
investors badly shaken, and that slowed plans for a selloff of more state-owned 
companies. The country's major health insurance fund nearly went bankrupt and 
required a large infusion of government cash. Strikes by various state 
employees were settled with big raises, and wages grew faster than 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was that interest rates lagged well behind inflation, savings 
declined and the inflationary surge pushed consumers into a buying spree. 
Imports began growing at twice the pace of exports, widening Israel's trade 
deficit and adding to pressure for devaluation of the shekel, its currency. 
</P>
<P>
 The key component in the inflationary spiral has been the cost of housing, 
which has soared 28% in the last year. The problem results primarily from the 
massive investment by previous governments in building settlements on the 
occupied West Bank and from the failure of the present government to release 
much state-held land for new construction within Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 In agriculture, where imports of meat, fruit and vegetables could bring down 
market prices, the agriculture ministry has resisted strongly in an effort to 
protect Israeli farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the government recently authorized increases in a number of services it 
provides or controls -- telecommunications, bus fares, school fees, among 
others -- that have wide impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, however, that neither the government nor the Bank of Israel 
wanted to trigger a recession. They tried modest interest-rate hikes, reforms 
of the money markets, curbs on government spending, a modest devaluation and 
other steps viewed by most economists as good but not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 There are warnings now that the Bank of Israel alone cannot bring down 
inflation with higher interest rates -- and that the latest increases put the 
economy at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Frenkel expressed confidence, however, that "within a few months" the higher 
interest rates combined with limits on government spending will begin to cut 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new 17% prime rate worries Israeli businesses, which warn that they 
will have to postpone plans for expansion and, with that, the creation of the 
new jobs needed by Russian immigrants still arriving by the tens of thousands.

MARKET SCENE; STICKY SWEET DISPUTE; POLAND'S WEDEL FAMILY FIGHTS FOR A SHARE OF 
THE VENERABLE CHOCOLATE COMPANY THEY LOST TO THE COMMUNISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN E. MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bustling E. Wedel chocolate shop in central Warsaw was built a century ago 
by Emil Wedel, but when the eminent Polish confectioner's great-granddaughter 
stopped by recently, she was just another paying customer. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular landmark is one of several retail outlets of the E. Wedel 
chocolate company, Poland's finest confectionery and, before World War II, a 
thriving family-run business of international renown with shops in Paris and 
London. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the company still bears the venerable Wedel name, but 
great-granddaughter Elzbieta Jasinka and other Wedel descendants are not 
welcome in the company boardroom, where a stern portrait of Jasinska's 
grandfather, the last Wedel to run the business, marks the only family 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to half a century of misfortune spanning two political systems in 
Poland, the Wedels lost the family business to the Communists after World War 
II and must now do battle with capitalists to get it back. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want some shares in the company," said Jasinka, 42. "The Wedels worked 
very hard to obtain a high quality of products, and this company is profiting 
from that work and reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a year, about a dozen descendants of Emil Wedel, whose immigrant 
German father began making candy in the family home in 1851, have been fighting 
in and out of court to regain rights to the company name -- and thereby a 
financial stake in the booming enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection of distant Wedel relatives, some of whom no longer live in 
Poland, claim that the Wedel name did not become government property when 
Communist authorities nationalized the chocolate company's assets in 1946. As a 
result, the family members say, the name was not among the company assets sold 
by Poland's newly democratic government in 1991 and, according to the Polish 
commercial code, cannot be used without the consent of the Wedel heirs. 
</P>
<P>
 PepsiCo Foods International Ltd. paid $25 million three years ago for 40% of 
the company's shares, with the remaining shares split between the state 
treasury, Wedel employees and a public offering. PepsiCo has since increased 
its share-holding to more than 60%, during which time the chocolate company has 
doubled its annual net revenue to about $104 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the present E. Wedel company was first registered in the trade register 
of companies, there was already an E. Wedel -- the prewar company -- on the 
books," said attorney Hanna Nowodworska-Grohman, who represents several family 
members. "Can you imagine what PepsiCo would do if someone went and registered 
a new PepsiCo company even though PepsiCo already exists?" 
</P>
<P>
 PepsiCo, which has been fighting the family in court, has taken a less rigid 
approach privately and is attempting to reach a financial settlement with the 
Wedel heirs. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S.-based company insists that the root problem lies with the Polish 
government, which ignored rumblings by the family several years ago and sold 
the company even though Poland has no law governing claims by former property 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "PepsiCo is trying to find a solution to a very difficult problem which would 
allow all parties to benefit," said Peter Robinson, regional vice president for 
PepsiCo Foods International. 
</P>
<P>
 The family's quest has taken on a greater significance because of the 
high-profile players and the precedent that it could set for the sale of other 
state-owned enterprises with unresolved property-rights issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years after the collapse of communism, Polish lawmakers have still not 
been able to agree on how to compensate prewar property owners and their heirs. 
</P>
<P>
 In selling some state-owned enterprises, including E. Wedel, the government 
has set aside 5% of the stock as a precaution to settle potential claims. But 
the Polish Parliament has not passed legislation allowing the reserved money to 
be spent. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the stumbling blocks is a dispute over who is entitled to the money. 
Some lawmakers want to compensate only those former owners whose property was 
seized in violation of Communist-era laws, while others insist that anyone who 
lost property under communism -- through means considered legal or not -- 
should be reimbursed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the government's official public offer of Wedel stock, made in 1991 after 
PepsiCo purchased the company's preferred stock, small investors were warned of 
"risks" in the family's interest in the name. The offer also stated that the 
company was secured from the risks by the state treasury -- an assertion that 
has not yet been borne out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Wedel case has pointed out that this country is still in a period of 
economic transition and that investors have to check very carefully all the 
legal issues in privatization deals," said Ryszard Kruk, vice president of the 
Polish-American Enterprise Fund, which has invested $200 million in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 When the company was offered to private investors in 1990, management was 
particularly keen on PepsiCo's offer because it was the only one promising to 
keep the E. Wedel name, which the company's surveys show is recognized in 95% 
of Polish households. 
</P>
<P>
 As for PepsiCo, whose identity is associated in Eastern Europe with soft 
drinks, E. Wedel brought into the corporate family a well-known and highly 
respected new product, a rare find in a country where few prewar brands were 
able to withstand 45 years of Communist mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our whole feeling about Wedel is that it has a huge place in Polish heritage, 
and the more we do to cement that and reinforce that, the better it will be for 
the Wedel shareholders and the Wedel business," Robinson said. "That is why we 
are so determined to keep the Wedel name. It would be a tragedy if the name was 
lost." 
</P>
<P>
 After a spate of ideological purism, even the Communist authorities could not 
resist the magic of the Wedel name. After nationalization, the business was 
changed to the 22nd of July Confectionery Works, a reference to an important 
date in the founding of communism in Poland. But when exports to the West grew 
in significance in the 1960s, the name was lengthened to 22nd of July 
Confectionery Works, Formerly E. Wedel, and with time, most everything but E. 
Wedel was dropped from everyday use. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all wanted a company that would carry the Wedel name," said Jozef 
Rutkowski, chairman of the E. Wedel board since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wedel descendants have won two important court victories, both of which 
ordered PepsiCo to change the name, but Pepsico continued to put E. Wedel on 
the label while it sought an appeal through the Polish Justice Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 The ministry decided last month to take the unusual step of requesting a 
special review of the case by the Polish Supreme Court, the clearest indication 
yet of how seriously the government views the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Jasinska, the great-granddaughter, said PepsiCo's continued use of the E. 
Wedel name smacks of arrogance and has hurt PepsiCo's reputation in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 "One would expect a Western company to know better, that a name, especially a 
family name, can't just be taken away," Jasinska said. "The inheritors are firm 
in following this through to the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Rutkowski, the Wedel board chairman, said PepsiCo has not been harmed by the 
dispute, nor has its chocolate company, which continues to make more and more 
money. With 3,000 employees, it remains the largest food products business in 
Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not critical of the Wedel family or what they are trying to do," he 
said. "The issue of nationalization should have been resolved a long time ago."

PHOTO ESSAY; PRAYERS OF HOPE IN HAITI CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The story is in the faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmering, often boiling, violence has marked the streets and countryside of 
Haiti since American troops came ashore to secure the Sept. 18 agreement to 
return President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power.These are times of change, 
dangerous times, in the Caribbean country. The anxiety, hope and fear are stark 
in the portraits of transition caught by Times photographer Carolyn Cole on 
assignment in Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 A moment of prayer, a dulled stare, the frenzy of the streets, a sleeping boy 
-- all images of a city and country caught up in strife and peril. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the scene was crowds of Haitians chanting "We Love You," as 
American soldiers raided the headquarters of a fearsome militia. Soon it may be 
larger crowds hailing the return of Aristide from his forced exile in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Haitians, these tumultuous times are borne with the hope of a better 
future. It's evident in the faces.

 One of the first college basketball preview magazines, Athlon, has made a 
somewhat surprising selection for national champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you spell UCLA? 
</P>
<P>
 The reason the Bruins are an unusual choice is that Arkansas has all five of 
its starters back from the team that won the NCAA title last season. 
</P>
<P>
 At least Jim Harrick had the right attitude about this prediction about the 
outcome of the NCAA tournament.

 "We'll just phone that thing in," he said. "We'll take it."

 More gruel? Mike O'Hara of the Detroit News doesn't sound like a big fan of 
the 280-pound Miller, now with the Pistons. 
</P>

 Said O'Hara: "First Terry Mills. Now Oliver Miller. I think the Pistons ought 
to hire Oprah Winfrey's cook and open a weight-loss clinic at The Palace."

 News item: City officials pooh-pooh talk of the NFL entering into a 
partnership to build a stadium in L.A. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Reaction: How dare city officials, who have done such a wonderful job of 
retaining the Coliseum's 1932 look, criticize any plan to improve the quality 
of football facilities here. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The run 'n' shoot might be the perfect offense for the Raiders, with their 
fleet of speedy wide receivers and lack of quality running backs. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Sunday was Old-Timers' Day at Anaheim Stadium, where the subjects of a pregame 
photo shoot were 17-year veterans Blair Bush of the Rams and Mike Kenn and Clay 
Matthews of the Atlanta Falcons and 19-year veteran Jackie Slater of the Rams. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Sean Landeta's tremendous punting exhibition was nothing new. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It was Landeta's pooch punt that pinned the Buffalo Bills back on their 
10-yard line with 2:16 left in Super Bowl XXV on Jan. 27, 1991. The Bills drove 
against the New York Giants, but could get close enough only for the 47-yard 
field goal attempt by Scott Norwood that sailed wide right and preserved the 
Giants' 20-19 lead. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Shane Conlan, who had his first sack as a Ram, is beginning to 
display the form that earned him three Pro Bowl spots as a Bill. . . .

 Atlanta quarterback Jeff George has one of the best arms in the NFL, but has 
yet to prove himself as a competitor. The Falcons didn't come alive in Anaheim 
until he was hurt and replaced by Bobby Hebert. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It will be interesting to see who starts for the Falcons when they return to 
the Southland on Oct. 23 against the Raiders at the Coliseum. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, Rams, UCLA and USC are a combined, not-so-lucky 7-11. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Bill Parcells isn't the only former New York Giant coach helping to build the 
New England Patriots into a contender.His offensive coordinator is Ray Perkins.

 General Manager Dick Steinberg of the New York Jets could be on the hot seat. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 In Wayne Fontes' sixth-plus season as head coach, Detroit remains one of the 
least predictable teams in the league. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Emmitt Smith suffering a strained hamstring late in the second quarter when 
the Dallas Cowboys are leading the Washington Redskins, 24-0, is my idea of a 
timely injury. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The AFC is 9-7 against the NFC this season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Time of possession meant something at Candlestick Park, where the Philadelphia 
Eagles hogged the ball for nearly 40 minutes during their 40-8 victory over the 
San Francisco 49ers. . . .

 Antonio Langham, the rookie cornerback from Alabama, is one reason the 
Cleveland Browns lead the NFL in fewest points per game allowed. . . .

 Inconsistent USC's two victories have been against schools ranked in the Top 
25 in the USA Today/CNN poll, Washington and Baylor. . . .

 Soul Of The Matter's victory in the Louisiana Derby stamps him as a contender 
in the wide-open Breeders' Cup Classic Nov. 5 at Churchill Downs. . . .

 Former boxing promoter Don Fraser sent word that former lightweight champion 
Jimmy Carter died last week at 70. Carter fought several times at the Olympic 
Auditorium and won the title in 1951 when he knocked out Ike Williams, who died 
last month. . . .

 "Major League/Minor League: Photographs of America's Baseball Stadiums by Jim 
Dow," a Smithsonian traveling exhibition, is on display through Nov. 13 at the 
Fullerton Museum Center. . . .

<P>
 Reversing a trend, the Angels announced a hiring the other day. Former sports 
columnist John Hall will fill the new position of director of public affairs. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Stu Black was the kind of friend everyone should be privileged to have. He was 
real. He was gentle and tough. He did wonderful work trying to improve the 
lives of gang members in New York. He was a talented sportswriter, actor and 
contributor to Roy Firestone's TV show. He died Sunday night after giving 
cancer a battle for several months. He was 49, far too young for us to lose 
him.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; USC; DROPPED PASSES ARE NOTHING NEW

<P>
 USC finally played a game the way it has been practicing, and paid for it with 
a 22-7 loss Saturday against Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Dating from the Trojans' August training camp and through most practices 
since, visitors have noted Trojan receivers dropping more passes than was the 
case a year ago.Of course, a year ago USC still had Johnnie Morton. 
</P>
<P>
 Trojan receivers dropped six of Rob Johnson's passes Saturday, Ken Grace 
muffing two of them. Add to that nine quarterback sacks, and the Trojans wound 
up with 60 minus yards in 15 passing downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, after four games, has been sacked 22 times for a loss of 151 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 X-rays of Johnson's right ankle, sprained Saturday night, were negative, Coach 
John Robinson said. "It's a high ankle sprain but it's not bad," he said. 
"We'll probably hold him out of practice (today) and just have him jog." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State, USC's opponent Saturday at Corvallis, Ore., is 1-3, but played 
well in a 30-10 loss at unbeaten Arizona last Saturday. And Coach Jerry 
Pettibone's option ground game is again atop the Pac-10, with an average of 
272.5 yards rushing. USC is last, at 118.8 yards a game. EARL GUSTKEY

</P>
<P>
 After an All-American freshman season, he has missed six of his last eight 
attempts.Five of the misses have come from 40 yards or farther, but none has 
been short. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bjorn, in the game, is just not kicking like he is in practice," UCLA Coach 
Terry Donahue said. "We've got to get him kicking that way. The last two weeks 
in practice, we've had him under pressure and he's 23 of 24 or 24 of 24." 
</P>
<P>
 The alternative is walk-on Greg Andrasick, who has never kicked in a college 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins moved into field-goal range in their first two possessions Saturday 
at Seattle, but Merten missed from 40 and 46 yards. His third try, from 44 
yards, was good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I had it down then," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he missed a 46-yarder, hitting the upright, shortly before halftime, and 
UCLA trailed, 10-3. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Inside linebacker Shane Jasper has a hip pointer and is questionable for this 
week's game at California. . . . No UCLA senior has ever played in a game in 
which the Bruins beat Cal. UCLA beat Cal 18 consecutive times from 1972-89, but 
the Bears have won all four games played in the '90s. They can be the first 
Pacific 10 team in 60 years to beat the Bruins five times in a row. JIM HODGES

THE NHL/HELENE ELLIOTT; CREATIVE ACCOUNTING CREATES DECEPTIVE FIGURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Owner Ed Snider of the Philadelphia Flyers says his team lost $3 million on 
$30 million of revenue last season, and he might bail out if the losses 
continue. The New York Rangers, who play in 18,200-seat Madison Square Garden, 
say they lost $7-$8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither club is being entirely truthful, but according to accepted accounting 
practices, neither is lying. 
</P>
<P>
 Each is a branch of a corporation with many tentacles. Snider also owns the 
Spectrum, Specta-Guard and Ticketmaster. The Rangers, Knicks, Madison Square 
Garden and the MSG Cable network are similarly linked, as properties of 
ITT-Sheraton/Cablevision. 
</P>
<P>
 In paying rent to the Spectrum, the Flyers are merely shifting money from one 
of Snider's pockets to another, but they can claim rent as an expense. In New 
York, money from advertisements displayed on the dasher boards during hockey 
games is considered revenue for the Garden, not for the Rangers. The 
possibilities for interpretation are nearly endless. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why revenue sharing would be so difficult to implement, at least until 
there's a standard definition of what constitutes revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Gary Bettman claims a majority of clubs have lost substantial 
amounts of money over the last four years, but he won't identify which clubs or 
how much was lost. It's a good bet more than a few use the same creative 
accounting practiced by the Flyers and Rangers. NUMBERS GAME 
</P>
<P>
 There are no goals, assists and penalties to tabulate, so here are some other 
numbers to crunch: 
</P>
<P>
 It took the NHL Players Assn. 51 hours to respond to the league's invitation 
last Friday to resume talks. Assuming they meet today as scheduled, 98 hours 
will have elapsed since Bettman announced the delay in the start of the season 
until Oct. 15 while negotiations continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Monday, 16 games had been postponed. Game 16 would have been 
memorable. Before it, the Rangers had planned to raise their Stanley Cup 
banner. Sad, isn't it, that after waiting 54 years to win the Cup, Ranger fans 
have to wait again? THEY COULDN'T HAVE ANSWERED BELL 
</P>
<P>
 Some players might not mind the delay because they can now recover from 
injuries that would have kept them out of the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Several wear Ranger uniforms: Adam Graves, who has a sore lower back; Joby 
Messier and Sergei Zubov, who have knee injuries, and Kevin Lowe, who underwent 
shoulder surgery. The Rangers also have yet to come up with the $6-million 
annual salary Mark Messier is demanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Also not ready were Quebec's Wendel Clark, who suffered a concussion in an 
exhibition, and Detroit's Steve Yzerman, recovering from back surgery. HE DID 
IT HIS WAY 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Esposito, the Tampa Bay Lightning's director of operations, doesn't 
understand why players and the league are feuding. 
</P>
<P>
 This never happened when he was president of the players' union, he said. When 
he and the owners disagreed, "no matter what we did, we hammered it out and 
just worked on it and worked on it until both sides got weary and said, 'OK, 
we'll do this.' That's how it gets done." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, but there's one big difference now. The NHLPA's executive director 
during Esposito's days was Alan Eagleson, who was friendlier with NHL President 
John Ziegler than many club owners were. Not surprisingly, that regime didn't 
get any revolutionary deals that made players rich. UNHAPPY CAMPERS 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever the season starts, defenseman Kevin Hatcher won't be back with the 
Washington Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatcher asked to be traded after they wouldn't pay him more than $3 million a 
season. Hatcher, who never reported to training camp, also cited a lack of 
support from fans and management as reasons for leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Dale Hawerchuk left the Buffalo Sabres' camp last Friday. He wants a 
raise from the $1.2 million he earned last season and he wants a guaranteed, 
three- year deal. The Sabres were willing to guarantee only one season. BURKE'S 
LAW 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Burke, who handles disciplinary matters as the NHL's senior vice 
president and director of operations, accepted a contract extension through the 
1995-96 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke's biggest battle might be in instituting standards for helmets. Shaken 
by the career-ending concussion suffered last season by the Blackhawks' Michel 
Goulet, Burke wants players to wear headgear that would blunt the impact of a 
collision. However, some players, including the Kings' Wayne Gretzky, cling to 
comfortable helmets that afford little protection. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the NHL must revoke the clause that allows players to go without 
helmets altogether if they sign an insurance waiver. Only Craig MacTavish, now 
of the Flyers, was foolish enough to do so last season. QUOTABLES 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chicago Blackhawk center Bernie Nicholls on Bettman's postponement: "With 
John Ziegler, at least we played." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Capital General Manager David Poile on who's to blame: "We have not managed 
our business well. We need help from players to control ourselves; they don't 
like to hear that." SLAP SHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Barnett, who represents No. 3 draft pick Radek Bonk, said he had "some 
positive discussions" with the Ottawa Senators. Bonk also has an offer to 
remain with Las Vegas of the International Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
 Left wing Jason Wiemer, picked eighth by Tampa Bay, signed for $2.45 million 
over three years. Left wing Jeff Friesen, drafted 11th by San Jose, signed for 
$3.2 million over four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers sent first-round draft pick Ed Jovanovski back to his junior 
team, Windsor of the Ontario Hockey League, to keep him in shape during the NHL 
delay. The Boston Bruins sent their top pick, Evgeny Ryabchikov, to Providence 
of the American Hockey League.

STEELERS GET LUCK OF GREENE; PRO FOOTBALL: LINEBACKER RECOVERS TWO FUMBLES AND 
RECORDS TWO SACKS AS PITTSBURGH DEFENSE DOMINATES HOUSTON FOR 30-14 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pittsburgh Steelers reversed a season-long succession of bad starts, 
turning Barry Foster's 115 yards and the helpless Houston Oilers' numerous 
mistakes into points on their first four possessions and a 30-14 romp Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Greene recovered two of four first-half fumbles by harried quarterbacks 
Cody Carlson and Bucky Richardson and the Steelers continued to excel on 
Monday, bolting to leads of 20-0 in the first quarter and 30-0 in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers (3-2), now 5-0 on Mondays under Coach Bill Cowher, were working 
on their third successive Monday night shutout at home until Richardson threw 
two touchdown passes in the final 9:11. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're tough on Mondays -- if we could play every game on Monday, we'd go to 
the Super Bowl," wide receiver Andre Hastings said. "The defense was relentless 
and the offense didn't mess around like we usually do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers had been outscored, 24-3, in the first quarter and trailed in all 
four games by at least 10 points, but this night Houston (1-4) never had a 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster had 100 yards by the first minute of the second half and Neil O'Donnell 
shrugged off his worst NFL start with a pair of big-play first-down passes in 
the Steelers' fourth Monday night victory in the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like Houston wasn't ready to play," said Foster, the AFC's leading 
rusher. "But getting some points early definitely pumped us up. When I'm 
getting so many yards untouched like I was, you know I'm getting some great 
blocking." 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers' defense forced a beaten-up Carlson out of the game in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a sore shoulder and a broken nose and was wearing a face shield, and 
we knew he'd be real cautious," linebacker Greg Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 A rattled Richardson wasn't much better, fumbling two of his first three 
snaps, but it was already 20-0 by then and it hardly mattered. The Oilers 
didn't score until Richardson pass plays of 76 yards to Ernest Givins and two 
yards to Haywood Jeffires, after Pittsburgh rookie Bam Morris' one-yard 
touchdown run made it 30-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was probably a mistake to start (Carlson)," Oilers Coach Jack Pardee said. 
"Our protection wasn't very good so I got him out of there." 
</P>
<P>
 The free agent-depleted Oilers are 1-4 for the second consecutive season, but 
off Monday's effort it's not likely they'll duplicate 1993 by winning their 
final 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our talent level is down from what it was last year. If we could do what we 
did last year, it would really be impressive," safety Marcus Robertson said. 
"It's not impossible, but it would take a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 But what saved the Steelers was O'Donnell didn't replay his dreadful 
four-interception day in a 30-13 loss in Seattle. With Foster dragging Oilers 
defenders with him on a succession of big gains, O'Donnell passed sparingly but 
effectively, completing nine of 17 passes for 154 yards, a touchdown and no 
interceptions.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; MOVES MADE TO SHORE UP DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having already given up an alarming 124 points in losing three of their first 
four games, and confronted with the unenviable task of facing two of the 
league's hottest quarterbacks over the next two weeks, the Raiders have shaken 
up their defensive unit by: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Moving Albert Lewis into the starting right cornerback spot in place of 
Lionel Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Moving top draft choice Rob Fredrickson into the starting left linebacker 
position in place of Aaron Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Making Wallace a part-time defensive lineman in addition to his new duty as 
a reserve linebacker. Wallace will be used in pass-rushing situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, in his 12th season, left the Kansas City Chiefs in the off-season to 
join the Raiders, agreeing to become a temporary reserve. But, in Lewis' mind, 
it was always temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't have come if I didn't think that, somewhere down the line, I would 
be a starter," he said. "I wasn't looking for an opportunity just to change 
logos or to make more money. I was looking for an opportunity where I could 
excel as a player and, hopefully, have some influence on the team as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington was stunned to learn he was the odd man out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was shocking," he said. "But those things happen and I have to deal with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, a Raider starter since 1990, had been slowed by a hamstring 
injury. Feeling he had played better in the last two games, Washington wasn't 
ready for the demotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't say anything," Washington recalled. "It's better not to say anything 
when you're angry and disappointed because you might say things you don't want 
to say. But each day, it gets harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington has one of the four Raider interceptions this season. He returned 
it 31 yards for a touchdown against the San Diego Chargers on Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders will be on the road the next two weeks, to face the New England 
Patriots, led by quarterback Drew Bledsoe, and the Miami Dolphins, led by 
quarterback Dan Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Scott Davis, who took two weeks off because of unexplained 
personal problems earlier this season, missed Monday's practice because of an 
adverse reaction to a flu shot. He is expected back Wednesday. . . . Running 
back Wes Bender, a member of the practice squad, is out because of chicken pox.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; WORKLOAD BECOMES A CONCERN FOR BETTIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams are trying to hide their quarterback injuries and problems with their 
passing game by handing the ball to tailback Jerome Bettis. But Bettis might be 
paying the price for the poundings he has taken. 
</P>
<P>
 He was limping as he walked to meetings Monday, after suffering a deep bruise 
on his lower back in the third quarter of the Rams' 8-5 loss to Atlanta on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis carried 29 times for 117 yards, including the first eight carries of 
the third quarter. He carried 35 times for 132 yards the previous week at 
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned," Bettis said. "At the pace I'm going, I can't sustain a full 
season. I have to be strong enough to endure some of this because we're on the 
threshold of some success. They need me until we can sort through the rough 
times and get to some better times." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis, the NFC's second-leading rusher with 507 yards, was injured when he 
was hit by Atlanta's Vinnie Clark early in the third quarter. He left the game 
for the next few plays but returned. 
</P>
<P>
 With an inexperienced Tommy Maddox replacing starting quarterback Chris 
Chandler in the second quarter, Coach Chuck Knox relied on Bettis' running 
between the tackles to control the ball in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Former Ram tailback Cleveland Gary is expected to sign a one-year, $200,000 
deal today with the Dallas Cowboys. Gary, released by the Rams during their 
final cut in August, passed a physical in Dallas on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys have been interested in signing Gary as a backup to Emmitt Smith 
since the Rams released him in late August, but Gary underwent an emergency 
appendectomy after he was cut. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Injury report: The Rams got some good news from center Bern Brostek, who is 
expected to practice this week after spraining both ankles Sunday. Brostek 
should be ready to go this week, Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluid has built up in the left knee of cornerback Steve Israel, who has missed 
the last three games, although surgery doesn't appear to be an option. 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive tackle Darryl Ashmore is still out with a sore knee and wide 
receiver Richard Buchanan, who has a pulled hamstring, isn't expected back.

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: LOOK AT THIS: ALHAMBRA HAS MADE TOP 20 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been so long since the Alhambra football team was ranked in any poll 
that Coach Gilbert Ruedaflores would not even offer a guess as to when the last 
time might have been. 
</P>
<P>
 But a rare 4-0 start has earned the Moors a spot at No. 19 in The Times top-20 
poll of area teams this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids have not known a lot about winning, and they're certainly not used 
to looking at the polls for their school," said Ruedaflores, who took over the 
program in 1989. "I don't think anyone has thought about our school in that 
manner for some time." 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra has not had a winning season under Ruedaflores, who is 23-30-1. The 
Moors made the Southern Section Division III playoffs in 1990 but were 
eliminated in the first round by Anaheim Esperanza, 47-0. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the elements seem to be coming together this year. The team is led by 
seniors who have played together for four years. There has been consistency in 
the coaching staff. Even the school's field has been done over, allowing the 
team to play home games for the first time in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Alhambra has an enrollment of 3,500, Ruedaflores has had trouble 
attracting players. The student body is predominantly Asian but most of the 
players are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only have about 32 kids out," Ruedaflores said. "Most of the students here 
don't know anything about football and have never played. We're trying to 
change that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Moors are led by twins Ayran and Ryan Hart, who start at quarterback and 
receiver, respectively. Running back Patrick Nieves, who took up the sport last 
year, has gained more than 100 yards in each of the first four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra seems to be getting better by the week. The Moors scored a 31-0 
victory over La Canada last weekend and will play host to Montebello 
Cantwell-Sacred Heart on Friday before beginning Almont League play against San 
Gabriel Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fall from top to bottom has been a long and painful one for the Canyon 
High football program in Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 The team was the epitome of success in the 1980s, setting a Southern Section 
record with 46 consecutive victories and three titles from 1983-86. Coach Harry 
Welch was among the winningest active coaches in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 The program had fallen off in recent years, however, and Welch had plenty of 
off-field problems as well. He resigned earlier this year and was replaced by 
assistant Larry Mohr. 
</P>
<P>
 The transition has been difficult. The Cowboys lost their first three games 
and four players quit the team last week, one of them a starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they have a whole lot of respect for me," Mohr said of the 
players. "So I decided (Friday) I'm going to tighten the reins. I think I'll be 
tested (by the players) for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon ended its losing streak Friday by tying Mission Hills Alemany, 13-13. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Day's debut as Glendora's football coach last month was embarrassing. The 
Tartans, a Southern Section Division IV semifinalist last year, were routed by 
Ayala in their opener, 40-0. Day and his staff were stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 "It left me wondering if I knew what I was doing," said Day, who coached at 
Whittier Pioneer last season. "We had implemented a new defense so I knew it 
would take some time to work things out." 
</P>
<P>
 The staff and team regrouped, and the anxiety has been eased by a three-game 
winning streak that has included victories over such powers as Rancho Santa 
Margarita and Covina Charter Oak. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana administrators have no one to blame but themselves for the sorry 
state of the school's football program. Since Dick Hill was let go as the coach 
in 1991, the Saints are 3-21. They have been outscored in four games this 
season, all losses, 147-40. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, Orange County's winningest coach with a record of 199-89-3, retired from 
teaching after the 1991 school year but wanted to continue coaching. Santa Ana 
officials nixed the idea and released him. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to varsity coaching this year, hired to rejuvenate the program at 
Orange. Orange improved to 3-1 last Thursday by defeating Santa Ana, 34-0. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 La Puente Bishop Amat strengthened its stance as the state's top football team 
with its convincing 34-3 victory over highly-touted Bakersfield Saturday night 
before 23,701 at Bakersfield College. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers' success is no surprise to Mark Paredes, who stepped down as coach 
last spring to take over the football program at Riverside North. Paredes won 
eight league titles and a Southern Section divisional championship in eight 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew what kind of a team I was leaving," said Paredes, who is 2-0-2 at 
North. "It was the right decision for me at the time and my feelings have not 
changed. I still have plenty of friends over there, but I'm so focused with 
what I'm trying to do here that I'm not as concerned with what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Salter, a longtime Bishop Amat assistant, succeeded Paredes. Prep Note 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep suspended five players for last Friday's game against 
Kilpatrick, which posted a 26-14 upset at Valley College. The Montclair players 
were benched for a recent hazing incident of a junior varsity player on the 
school bus after practice. Times' Top 20 Football Poll

L.A. UNIVERSITY BEAT/WENDY WITHERSPOON: CROATIAN EMIGRES FUEL USC IN WATER POLO 
</P>

 Marko Zagar left his homeland, Croatia, clutching a one-way ticket to a place 
he knew little about and trying desperately to stop thinking about all the 
things he was giving up. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them was a promising career with the Croatian national water polo team. 
Instead, Zagar was on his way to USC and a college career in water polo. He 
probably will never play for his native country again. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Zagar left, the national team coaches warned him that they would not 
invite him back. They figured Zagar would not gain the experience necessary to 
return to the national level in their country. 
</P>
<P>
 "They take their water polo very seriously in Croatia," said John Williams, 
USC's coach. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a difficult decision for Zagar. His father, Zdravko, was a member of 
the national water polo team in the late 1950s. But Zagar figured that his 
future held other things. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Europe, water polo is (full-time work)," he said. "You play for your club 
and the national team. Here, your first occupation is studying, you are a 
student-athlete, not an athlete-student." 
</P>
<P>
 Zagar, a sophomore, believed that putting the student part of his life first 
would help him in the long run. He hopes to earn a degree in business or 
international relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that when I graduate from here, I can help with my country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatia is one of five independent republics that were formed after the 
collapse of the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which has been ravaged 
by war since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The war put all aspects of normal life on hold in Croatia, including water 
polo. Zagar was 18 and had graduated from high school when the army called. He 
spent a brief stint in basic training in his hometown, Zagreb, before returning 
to the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the top scorer for the junior national team in 1989 and was selected 
the most valuable player at the junior national championships in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams heard about Zagar through Jovan Vavic, a USC assistant coach. Vavic 
was a member of a club that was a four-time national champion of Yugoslavia in 
the 1970s. Vavic had heard about Zagar through his contacts in the area and 
persuaded Zagar to come to the United States. Hrvoje Cizmic of Split, Croatia, 
came along with Zagar. 
</P>
<P>
 Cizmic was not quite as heralded as Zagar, but had also played for the 
Croatian junior national team. 
</P>
<P>
 Zagar leads USC with 23 goals and 25 points and Cizmic is second with 22 goals 
and 24 points. The Trojans, with an 8-3 record, are ranked second in the nation 
and finished in second place behind Stanford at the Stanford invitational 
during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I see that I didn't make a mistake," Zagar said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Balkan pipeline also has benefited the Trojan women's volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Lisa Love recruited Vesna Dragicevic before this season after hearing 
about her from the water polo assistant coach, Vavic. Dragicevic, a 6-foot-1 
outside hitter from Ivanjica, Serbia, has earned a starting position and is 
second on the team in kills with 3.5 a game. 
</P>

 Eric Peterson, UCLA women's cross-country coach, was out of town last year 
when he got the message: 
</P>
<P>
 A runner from Arkansas was interested in transferring to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 What? Arkansas runners, among the best in the nation, simply don't transfer to 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last season, the Bruins had never even had a conference champion, let 
alone a national champion. 
</P>
<P>
 The message didn't say which Arkansas runner was thinking of transferring, but 
by process of elimination, Peterson guessed it might be Shelley Taylor, a 
two-time All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor had been the state cross-country champion at Huntington Beach Edison 
High in 1991 and, Peterson figured, she might be interested in going to college 
closer to her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the paperwork was done and, overnight, the Bruins' program became 
respectable. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, a junior, finished ninth at the NCAA championships last season, 
three-tenths of a second ahead of Karen Hecox, the 1993 Pacific 10 Conference 
and NCAA District 8 champion who returns to UCLA for her senior season. 
</P>
<P>
 Hecox won the Stanford Invitational this weekend and Taylor finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are looking very good right now," Peterson said. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Banachowski, UCLA women's volleyball coach, won the 750th game of his 
career on Sept. 23, a 5-15, 15-13, 11-15, 15-9, 15-7 victory at Arizona. But 
for Banachowski, who has more victories than any other NCAA women's volleyball 
coach, No. 750 simply means that he is the oldest coach around. "It's not 
really something that I use as any real measure of anything except, I guess, 
longevity," he said. Banachowski, in his 28th season as UCLA coach, is 753-149 
and has won three NCAA championships. The No. 3 Bruins are 13-1. . . . Brian 
Gimmillaro, Long Beach State women's volleyball coach, won the 250th game of 
his career on Sept. 24, over New Mexico State at Long Beach. Gimmillaro, in his 
10th season, is 252-75 and has won two NCAA championships. Long Beach is 9-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Since walking on at Long Beach last season, volleyball player Heather Hofmans 
has unexpectedly taken over the starting setter position this season. Last 
season, Hofmans played back-up to Joy McKienzie, an All-American. This season, 
highly-touted freshman Lori Price was expected to start, but Hofmans won the 
spot. She is playing in pain, though, this season. Her right ring finger is 
broken. . . . For the first time in four years, Long Beach is looking up to 
some of its Big West Conference opponents in the American Volleyball Coaches 
Assn. poll. No. 5 Pacific, No. 7 Hawaii and No. 9 UC Santa Barbara are all 
above No. 10 Long Beach.

FAIRPLEX; FLORES SHUT OUT, BUT WINS SIXTH CONSECUTIVE TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ROBLEDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When David Flores was thrown from his mount after the end of Sunday's ninth 
race at Fairplex Park, it also ended the remote chance he had of breaking his 
meet record of 48 victories. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing was further from his mind as he felt a twinge of pain in his right 
hip and took the rest of the afternoon off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to make sure I could ride the last day," said the 26-year-old 
native of Tijuana, who prides himself on being ready to ride any time and at 
any track. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the top riders, who usually take some time off during the 19-day 
meeting at Pomona, Flores likes to stay busy. 
</P>
<P>
 It has paid dividends for him at Fairplex, where he was shut out for the first 
time on Monday's closing day card but still wound up with 42 victories to win 
his sixth consecutive Fairplex riding title. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando Valenzuela, second with 32 winners, rode Luxury Box to an upset over 
Southern Tempo and Flores in the $50,000 Fairplex Breeders' Cup Stakes. Now 
it's back to riding with the big boys at Santa Anita in the Oak Tree meet that 
will begin Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it's back to scrambling to get some live horses," said Flores, who has no 
such problems at Fairplex. "Better horses make you a better rider. Of course, 
the rider has to do his part, but you really need good horses to be 
consistent." 
</P>
<P>
 Flores is proud of the fact that until the final day, he had at least one 
winner each day. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be hard on jockeys who ride a lot of favorites because fans are 
critical of them if they have a prolonged losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing complicated about the Flores formula for winning on the 
five-eighths-mile track with the tight turns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just go all out on every race," Flores said. "I'm trying to win with every 
horse and if I can get them out quickly, I have a chance to get to the wire 
first." 
</P>
<P>
 Flores believes the strategy can work at Santa Anita too, if he can get better 
horses to ride. Fairplex Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Wish, winner of the Pomona Handicap, was voted horse of the meet by 
members of the media. Vladimir Cerin won the training title with 10 winners 
from 21 starters.

POLLS FAVOR CARDOSO IN BRAZILIAN VOTING; ELECTION: EX-FINANCE MINISTER MAY 
AVOID RUNOFF IN PRESIDENTIAL RACE. HE IS CREDITED WITH HALTING RUNAWAY 
INFLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the man credited with halting Brazil's decade-long 
runaway inflation -- at least for now -- was poised Monday to become the 
nation's second democratically elected president in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 As the 94 million registered voters headed to the ballot boxes, Cardoso, 
candidate of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party, was heavily favored by 
every national poll to capture the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 A final poll by Datafolha released Sunday projected that the 63-year-old 
sociologist and former senator would capture more than 50% of the vote and 
avoid a November runoff with projected runner-up Luis Inacio (Lula) da Silva, a 
former union leader and candidate of the left-leaning Workers' Party. 
</P>
<P>
 The first official tallies are not expected until this afternoon. Final 
official results will not be complete for at least five days. If they show that 
Cardoso did not get more than 50% of the vote, he could face Lula, as Da Silva 
is universally known, in a Nov. 15 contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoso -- an author, a former ambassador to the United States and, briefly, a 
political exile during the country's 21-year military dictatorship -- swept to 
the front of a field of eight presidential hopefuls atop a wave of support for 
an economic plan he devised while serving earlier this year as the country's 
finance minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the commencement in July of his Real Plan -- which included the 
introduction of a new currency, the real -- inflation dropped from 50% in June 
to 6% in July and less than 1% in August. 
</P>
<P>
 As the nation's economy stabilized, voters turned quickly away from Lula, once 
the leading candidate, and toward Cardoso. 
</P>
<P>
 "By voting for him," said student Virginia Goas, 20, after casting her vote 
for Cardoso in Sao Paulo, "it guarantees that the plan will continue to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Mateus Helio of Sao Paulo also voted for Cardoso. "He's stabilized Brazil," 
said the 54-year-old composer. "That hasn't happened in a long time. He 
deserves to be president." 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, Cardoso will be the second popularly elected president since 1964, 
when a military dictatorship took power. The military ruled until 1984, when 
Jose Sarney was installed as president through a parliamentary process. 
Fernando Collor de Mello became president in 1989 following national elections 
but was impeached three years later on corruption charges and succeeded by his 
vice president, Itamar Franco. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's elections were the biggest in Brazil's history, with voters choosing 
not only a new president but also hundreds of members of Congress, two-thirds 
of the Senate, all 27 governors and 1,500 state legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 In major cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Salvador and Belo 
Horizonte, voters waded to the polls on streets littered with election 
pamphlets, posters and papers distributed by hand, thrown to pedestrians from 
passing cars or rained down like confetti from office buildings during the 
final days of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting is mandatory in Brazil for residents aged 18 to 70. Those 16 and 17 can 
vote if they desire. Monday was declared a national holiday to assure voters 
time to go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "This campaign has been really great" because it has avoided mudslinging, 
Cardoso told reporters in Sao Paulo as he headed to his polling place. 
</P>
<P>
 Lula, 48, denounced the election as "illegitimate" after casting his vote in 
an industrial suburb of Sao Paulo. Cardoso, he said, was boosted by big 
business, the media, the Franco government and the distribution of fraudulent 
sample ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 12 million incorrect sample ballots used to educate voters before 
the election were found in the possession of Cardoso's party and in the offices 
of two other parties with which he has formed alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ballots, Lula's name appeared third instead of fourth, as it appears on 
the official ballot. Lula said the incorrect position would confuse millions of 
illiterate voters who had been taught to vote according to the position of the 
candidate's name on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Election officials and members of Lula's party said they will be watching the 
vote tabulations carefully to see how many votes Carlos Gomes receives that 
could have been intended for Lula. Gomes, who is third on the ballot, is 
projected to receive only 3% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Election officials will also be watching the vote tallies in the newly formed 
state of Tocinas, where, in 70 of the state's 123 cities, there are more 
registered voters than there are people. State election officials launched a 
belated investigation Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The government on Monday sent troops to 12 states to maintain order, but a 
Superior Electoral Court spokeswoman said there had been no reports of violence 
or fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-six members of Lula's party were arrested in the state of Santa 
Catarina, however, for campaigning too close to an election site, and voting 
was temporarily stopped at a balloting site in Rio de Janeiro when a gun battle 
broke out nearby between police and drug traffickers.

<P>
 The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights would receive $9.5 million for the next 
fiscal year under a bill passed Monday by the House.Senate action is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 The House bill, passed by voice vote, also authorizes the commission to use 
public service announcements and advertising to discourage discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission was created in 1957 to investigate discrimination and 
violations of equal protection under the law based on race, color, age, sex, 
religion, physical disability or national origin. The commission also enforces 
federal civil rights law and equal opportunity in employment, education and 
housing.

QUARANTINE SEEN AS MEDFLY FINDS RISE; AGRICULTURE: NUMBER OF INSECTS FOUND IN 
CAMARILLO CLIMBS TO 33, AS GROWERS AND PACKERS STOP SHIPPING UNDER A TEMPORARY 
BAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER and JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the count of Medflies found in Camarillo rose Monday to 33, growers and 
packers in the infested area began shutting down shipping operations under a 
temporary ban expected to be followed by an official quarantine by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary ban and expected quarantine come at the tail end of the citrus 
and avocado season, with the majority of the fruit already harvested and 
shipped. 
</P>
<P>
 But agriculture officials said long-term financial impacts of the quarantine 
were still expected to hit hard, with the lucrative Japanese export market 
virtually sure to shut out the quarantine area and possibly more of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Friday, we were hoping it would be just a couple of flies," said Rex 
Laird, executive director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau. "But with the 
finds we've had since then, there is no question we are dealing with an 
infestation." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, authorities confirmed that 31 more Medflies were trapped Sunday in 
an orange grove at St. John's Seminary in Camarillo, within a quarter-mile of 
the fig tree where two fertile female flies were trapped Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 31 Medflies, all wild males, were trapped Sunday with a pheromone lure 
that typically attracts males. The females were caught with a food lure, which 
appeals to hungry females ready to lay eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More flies trapped Monday were considered suspicious and sent to a Sacramento 
laboratory for confirmation, a spokesman said. No details were available on how 
many flies were sent off or where they were found, but officials expected to 
know today whether they, too, were Mediterranean fruit flies. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional find guaranteed a quarantine for the area, officials said, with 
California Secretary of Food and Agriculture Henry Voss expected to sign the 
order today or Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Extensive trapping efforts will continue this week to determine the spread of 
the infestation, said Douglas Hendrix, a spokesman with the Cooperative Medfly 
Project, a task force made up of state and federal agriculture officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, it's all within a quarter-mile, so that leads us to believe at this 
point that it's a localized outbreak," he said of the 31 additional flies. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless more Mediterranean fruit flies are found farther from the original 
site, the quarantine area will probably encompass 81 square miles, emanating 
about 4.5 miles in all directions from the site of the original find, Hendrix 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The choices for wiping out the infestation are ground or aerial spraying of 
the pesticide malathion or releasing sterile male flies to mate with wild 
females. However, there are no sterile flies available at present, a state 
Department of Food and Agriculture spokeswoman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 No decisions on aerial spraying have yet been made, but Gov. Pete Wilson would 
have to declare an emergency before Voss could order aerial spraying, a Wilson 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still in the fact-finding stage," said Carla Agar, a spokeswoman with 
the California Department of Food and Agriculture. "But clearly, aerial 
spraying is an option that we have to consider." 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents and home organic growers in the area are already upset as the 
possibility of overhead spraying looms. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Deeter, a Thousand Oaks resident and a member of the Conejo Valley 
Organic Garden Club, said she and other area residents oppose it and would seek 
help from organized groups in Los Angeles County to mount resistance to 
spraying.  
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't work, and it's the most expensive alternative there is," she said. 
"We don't want to make the same mistake that Los Angeles County made."

 Since Saturday, officials have been notifying growers, packers, shippers, 
nurseries and produce stand operators within the possible quarantine area that 
a temporary halt to shipping of all host produce is in effect until the extent 
of the infestation is determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Grower Craig Underwood said inspectors spoke with him Monday, giving him 
instructions on how to handle sales at his roadside fruit stand. His 150 acres 
of lemons are picked and shipped for this year, so his concern, he said, is 
more for the long term. 
</P>
<P>
 The growers are all "holding their breath," he said. "It's like you're walking 
on a tightrope." 
</P>
<P>
 Fruits and vegetables that are host to the Medfly include lemons, oranges, 
avocados, cherimoya, grapefruit and tomatoes and account for billions of 
dollars in income to Ventura County growers. Strawberries, celery and lettuce, 
also important crops in the county, are not considered hosts. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan -- which annually buys about a third of the county's highest-quality 
fruit -- will not accept imports from a quarantined area, regardless of whether 
the produce has been treated and cleared for shipment by state inspectors, a 
spokesman with the Cooperative Medfly Project said. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan could also decide to ban imports from the entire county, the farm 
bureau's Laird said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't know yet what the foreign countries will do to us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Peck, president of the Ventura County Farm Bureau, said it may not matter 
what boundaries are set for the quarantine. "If Japan gets involved, it doesn't 
matter how close you are (to the quarantine area), because they're not going to 
say 'Oxnard' or 'Camarillo.' They're going to say 'Ventura County.' And that's 
what worries everybody most."  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 New Zealand and Australia already have banned shipments from Ventura County, 
because it is within 50 miles of Medfly finds in Los Angeles County, said Alan 
Voorhees, who manages the 80 acres of citrus groves for St. John's Seminary. 
</P>
<P>
 But Voorhees said the timing was as good as it could be for a disaster to hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it had to happen, for citrus and avocado, this is a much better time than 
if it had happened in February or March when we would be right in the peak of 
our largest harvesting." 
</P>

Medfly Life Cycle Thirty-three wild Medflies have been found near Camarillo 
since Thursday. In warm-weather, it can take as little as 2.5 weeks for a 
female Medfly to hatch and lay its own eggs. The cycle takes longer in cooler 
weather. 1. The adult female pierces the skin of the fruit with a needle like 
tube and deposits one to 10 eggs inside. Other Medflies may deposit eggs in the 
same puncture, and up to several hundred eggs have been found in a single spot. 
The eggs hatch two to three days after being laid. 2. The eggs hatch into 
legless larvae that feast on the fruit, tunneling throughout the pulp. The 
larvae continue to feed for six to 10 days, shedding their outer skin several 
times as they grow. 3. The spoiled fruit then falls to the ground and the 
mature larvae crawl into the dry, upper layer of soil or into leaves on top of 
the soil. There, they continue to evolve within a cocoon like outer layer 
called a puparium. 4. Six to 15 days later, the adult fly emerges and must feed 
before reaching sexual maturity. The female begins laying eggs four to five 
days later. If temperatures are cooler, the flies will take longer to emerge 
from the puparium and longer to mature. Source: University of California 
Cooperative Extension Office Quarantine Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * BOUNDARIES: Quarantine boundaries are being drawn up by federal and state 
agriculture officials. The most likely area will encompass 81 square miles 
within about a 4.5-mile radius of the site. 
</P>
<P>
 * DECISION: Once a quarantine is imposed, officials will decide how to 
eradicate the Medflies and treat produce grown within the infested area to 
allow it to be shipped. 
</P>
<P>
 * TREATMENT: Host fruit or vegetables within the area will be put in cold 
storage for a certain period, sprayed with pesticide or fumigated at growers' 
expense, officials said. Agriculture inspectors then must clear the produce for 
shipment before it can leave the area. 
</P>
<P>
 * SHIPPING: After the produce is cleared, it can be shipped to any area 
worldwide that will accept it.

BILL'S VETO MEANS $800,000 LOSS TO 3 COLLEGES IN COUNTY; EDUCATION: THE MEASURE 
WOULD HAVE SHIFTED MONEY FROM THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND. DISTRICT'S BUDGET 
ASSUMED IT WOULD BE SIGNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ventura County's three community colleges must cut $800,000 from an already 
lean budget because the governor has refused to sign a bill that would have 
reinstated funding lost to sinking property values. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed a bill by Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) 
that would have diverted millions of dollars from the state's general fund to 
California's 107 community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 The veto means the Ventura County Community College District will lose 
$800,000 it was counting on from Sacramento to balance its 1994-95 budget, a 
$59.6-million spending plan that is $3 million short of what the district spent 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees for the three-campus district narrowly approved a final budget last 
month that assumed the governor would sign the bill into law. At the time, 
administrators said there was nothing left to cut from the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the budget process, administrators warned of potential layoffs of 
part-time teachers and the cancellation of numerous classes if more money could 
not be found. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vice Chancellor Jeff Marsee said Monday that the colleges should be able 
to cover the latest shortfall without canceling classes or laying off 
instructors. Come February, however, when another property-tax adjustment is 
due from Sacramento, such drastic cuts might become necessary, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In each of the last three years there has been a downward hit" in the 
February budget adjustments, Marsee said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the California Assembly, Wilson said he vetoed the bill because 
it would have permanently taken cash from the state's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be more prudent to make this decision on a year-by-year basis, 
rather than putting the budget on an even greater autopilot," Wilson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 But the funding guarantees, as outlined in the O'Connell bill, already extend 
to the state's elementary and secondary schools as well as the University of 
California and Cal State University systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is terrible that the governor is unwilling to honor the budget for 
community colleges that he himself approved," O'Connell said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the veto angered at least one of the county's community college board 
members. Trustee Pete E. Tafoya said Wilson's refusal to sign the bill was 
another example of the governor's failure to support public education. 
</P>
<P>
 "People should pay attention to this come Nov. 8," Tafoya said. 
</P>
<P>
 College board President Allan W. Jacobs, who with Tafoya and Trustee Karen M. 
Boone approved the final budget Sept. 13, said he was confident college 
administrators would find a way out of the latest budget crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of a $60-million budget, we can certainly find areas that we'll have to 
reduce or cut back on," Jacobs said. "(But) I don't see any pocket that it 
could come from directly. It will have to be spread across the whole system." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Jacobs and Tafoya said they would not support tapping into a Ventura 
College bookstore fund of $500,000, a proposal raised last month by Trustee 
Gregory P. Cole. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole and Trustee Timothy D. Hirschberg refused to approve the final budget 
last month, saying it was unwise to count on the $800,000 when adopting a 
spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to have to be some cuts made, there's no question about that," 
Cole said Monday. "But I think the whole system has to be overhauled. Many 
states don't provide the greatly subsidized community colleges that California 
does." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Marsee said he would present a series of alternatives to trustees at tonight's 
meeting of the colleges' governing board, including a plan to use an 
anticipated $1 million health insurance refund to cover the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "But some of that money has to be shifted to other obligations," the vice 
chancellor said. "For immediate needs the money will be handy, but we've still 
got some downsizing and reorganizing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The district can save an undetermined amount of money by continuing the hiring 
freeze implemented earlier this year and by not filling the positions of 
employees who quit or retire, he said.

CITY, SCHOOLS DIFFER ON AERIAL SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Most city leaders in Camarillo support aerial spraying of malathion to combat 
the area's Medfly infestation, but school officials and day-care workers raised 
concerns about the pesticide's harmful effects on children's health. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of five City Council members and City Manager Bill Little said Monday the 
state should spray from the air or take other measures needed to protect the 
county's $848-million-a-year agricultural industry from potential devastation 
of the fruit-eating pest. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind, it's a very clear-cut issue," said Mayor Ken Gose. "We must 
absolutely do everything we can to eradicate this pest from the county. We 
can't let it take over." 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders, except for Councilman Stan Daily, who could not be reached, 
unanimously supported aerial spraying if ordered by state agricultural 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's far too much on the line to do anything else," Councilman David M. 
Smith said. "If they (agricultural officials) call for it, we should support 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet children's advocates want officials to take a more cautious approach in 
the interest of public health. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very concerned about the idea of spraying," said Jan McDonald, school 
board president for the Pleasant Valley School District. "I want to know what 
kind of lingering effects the spraying might have on our kids should they 
become exposed to it. Right now, we have many more questions than answers." 
</P>
<P>
 Kacy Perez, a teacher at St. Columba's Pre-School and Daycare on East Las 
Posas Road, said she worried about the effect of aerial spraying on about four 
dozen children who attend the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're located next door to a strawberry field and we get headaches every time 
they have a crop-duster go through," Perez said. "When it comes to spraying, we 
stay indoors and keep the windows shut tight." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At The Children's Place day care and preschool on Antonio Avenue, director 
Elaine Francisco said malathion spraying might force the center to shut down 
during spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not out of the question that we might close for a day if need be," 
Francisco said. "The safety and well-being of our kids comes first." 
</P>
<P>
 At Child Development Resources of Ventura County, a nonprofit organization 
that administers the 16 federal Head Start centers across the county, officials 
said the possibility of spraying raises concerns for the safety of their young 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We intend to keep our parents informed," Administrative Coordinator Jeff 
Davis said. "Until they make a decision to spray, we will continue to monitor 
this situation very carefully." 
</P>
<P>
 Rube Davis, a longtime Camarillo Leisure Village resident, said he was 
concerned about the effects of the pesticide on many of the older residents at 
the village, particularly those with respiratory problems or in frail health. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it is something that I would like to see happen," Davis said. 
"I understand how important agriculture is to the county, but I think the 
health of people is important too." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the scientific community and activists are at odds over the effects 
of malathion on humans, state health officials recommend that people stay 
indoors during aerial spraying, rinse down outdoor areas, wash skin and 
clothing that comes in contact with the pesticide and scrub home-grown produce. 
</P>
<P>
 An intensive spraying program in 1989 dropped thousands of gallons of 
malathion across four Southern California counties at a cost of more than $50 
million. A year after that spraying effort was finished, trappers found 25 
flies in Koreatown in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 By late 1992, hundreds of Medflies were found across many areas of the 
Southland -- many of which had been previously sprayed with the pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo City Manager Little said he worked in a city that underwent aerial 
spraying of malathion in 1989. At the time, he was city manager of Orange. He 
said the spraying seemingly had little effect on residents there. 
</P>
<P>
 Little said that when the brownish-pink pesticide -- 10% malathion solution 
and 90% corn syrup -- was sprayed over his city, more complaints were generated 
from the corn syrup used to attract the flies than the malathion itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope they don't have to resort to aerial spraying. With any luck they will 
be able to handle it from the ground," Little said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, if they do spray from the air, it's not so bad. The worse part is to 
leave your car outside by mistake when they're flying. It's like having caramel 
candy sprayed on it," he said.

 A city-hired consultant mapped out Ventura's evolving economy at a Monday 
study session for council members, emphasizing that city leaders must 
understand the city's own economic structure before trying to compete for new 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's simply no longer 'Put an ad in the Wall Street Journal and hope somebody 
is going to call.'That's not going to cut it in the competitive market there is 
now,"said James King, a Sacramento-based consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 King told the council that retailers account for 41% of the city's businesses, 
while the burgeoning service sector comprises 22%. 
</P>
<P>
 Service jobs -- which include work in engineering, health care, management 
consulting and legal affairs -- are the kind of high paying jobs the city wants 
to attract, King said.  
</P>
<P>
 He also noted that manufacturing, which accounts for 8% of the city 
businesses, is declining as an industry, just as it is around the state and the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 King will next prepare a report outlining the growing industries best suited 
to be recruited by the city. That report will be ready in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need active, creative businesses," King said. "You can't make that 
happen, but you can facilitate it." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they appreciated King' swift work and looked forward to 
the next installment. 
</P>
<P>
 For the initial report, King and another consultant looked at the list of 
companies that have renewed their business licenses with the city for 1995. The 
renewals were due by July, city staff said. The consultants also looked at 
sales tax receipts for Ventura industries in 1993 and in 1988. CONSTANCE SOMMER

 The Democratic Club of Ventura will ask one of its representatives on the 
county's Democratic Central Committee to resign because he has publicly 
endorsed a Republican state Assembly candidate, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett Tremaine has endorsed Brooks Firestone instead of Democrat Mindy 
Lorenz in the 35th Assembly District race.The district covers Ventura, Ojai, 
Santa Paula and most of Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 Tremaine, 55, not only supports Firestone but has agreed to let the Republican 
candidate use his name and endorsement in campaign literature. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brooks Firestone is one of the best candidates for state Assembly I've ever 
met, regardless of party affiliation," Tremaine is quoted as saying in one 
recent Firestone press release. 
</P>
<P>
 Tremaine said Monday that he believes Lorenz to be too liberal. He criticized 
her for opposing the death penalty and for her past affiliations with the Green 
Party and the Peace and Freedom Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not believe she is a loyal Democrat," said Tremaine, adding that he has 
been a registered Democrat for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Lorenz questioned Tremaine's own party loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he should resign" his membership to the Democratic club and the 
county central committee, she said. "He has no business being in a leadership 
position." The central committee performs basic party functions such as 
recruiting candidates, registering voters and getting people to the polls on 
election day. 
</P>
<P>
 Darlene Mosser, acting president of the Democratic Club, said she will 
recommend that Tremaine resign from the club, of which he has been a member for 
about two years. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Monday, Tremaine said he had not been asked to step down. He did say, 
however, that he would probably fight any attempt to remove him from the club.

<P>
 A Ventura man was shot in the hand early Monday after he was kidnaped and 
taken to a remote orchard outside Fillmore, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaun A. Landy, 29, was shot about 4 a.m. at Sycamore Road and Young Street, 
deputies said.He fled into an orange grove and had a nearby resident call for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly thereafter, sheriff's deputies arrested Raymond S. Price, 36, and his 
girlfriend, Cathy E. Jordan, 28, both of Ventura, on suspicion of attempted 
murder and kidnaping, Ventura police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Landy told police he had gone to Price's house in the 1500 block of Nevin 
Avenue in Ventura to settle a dispute about some construction tools that Landy 
had borrowed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 An argument ensued, during which Landy said he was beaten up, ordered into a 
truck and taken to the orchard, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Price and Jordan were being held at Ventura County Jail in lieu of $250,000 
bail each, Sheriff's Sgt. Jeff Matson said. Both are scheduled to be arraigned 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Landy was taken to Santa Paula Memorial Hospital, where a spokeswoman said he 
was treated for a gunshot wound to the left hand and then released. GREG RIPPEE

<P>
 In an attempt to ease rush-hour traffic through a southeast Camarillo 
intersection, the City Council has approved spending nearly $85,000 to install 
a signal at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic signal will be installed at the intersection of Dawson Drive at 
Petit Street, said Tom Fox, the city's traffic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously approved the expenditure at its meeting last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox said the new signal will go a long way toward relieving morning and 
late-afternoon traffic congestion in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The bid of $84,738 by the Ventura-based Taft Electric Co. was accepted and 
certified by the council as being the lowest. Construction on the new signal is 
expected to get under way shortly, officials said. J.E. MITCHELL

 A Colorado man who stopped in Fillmore with car trouble found himself behind 
bars after Ventura County sheriff's deputies discovered about $53,000 worth of 
cocaine in his vehicle, authorities said Monday.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: AMTRAK ENGINEER REMOVED FROM DUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amtrak passengers riding the train north from Los Angeles to Ventura County 
had to finish their trip by bus Sunday when authorities yanked the train's 
engineer off duty for failing to stop at a signal. 
</P>
<P>
 A seven-car train on Amtrak's popular San Diegan line came to a sudden halt 4 
1/2 miles southeast of Moorpark after authorities radioed the engineer to stop 
immediately, Amtrak spokeswoman Dawn Soper said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified engineer had apparently overrun a red signal light on the 
track between Simi Valley and Moorpark -- where all trains, freight and 
passenger, are supposed to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal transportation rules, any crew committing such a violation is 
promptly taken off duty, tested for drug and alcohol use and kept from 
operating another train until the incident is investigated, Soper said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A rules violation is a serious violation," she said. "There's a lot of rail 
traffic. . . . You can't have everyone just running amok." 
</P>
<P>
 Although an investigation of the incident is still under way, Soper said 
Amtrak officials believe none of the crew was under the influence of drugs or 
alcohol.  
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that it was misjudgment of distance," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The train, which runs between San Diego and Santa Barbara, had 168 passengers 
when it left Los Angeles that afternoon, but some may have boarded or 
disembarked at stops between Los Angeles and Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers were stuck on the stalled train for about 30 minutes outside 
Moorpark, until a train supervisor arrived.  
</P>
<P>
 The train then pulled into the Moorpark station where passengers waited at 
least another 40 minutes for buses to arrive from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Chartered by Amtrak, the buses dropped passengers at their destinations -- 
railroad stations in Oxnard, Ventura and Santa Barbara. But they were at least 
2 1/2 hours later than scheduled. MAIA DAVIS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; PROJECT MAY USE AIR QUALITY FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks council members tonight will consider dipping into their Air 
Quality Fund to subsidize a project designed to showcase the information 
superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Caltrans Advanced Telecommunications Project aims to demonstrate the power 
of computer technology by teaching business people how to hold video 
conferences and tap into vast data banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Once users become adept at navigating the information superhighway, Caltrans 
officials hope they will become hooked. And the more business they can transact 
through their keyboards, the less need they will have to drive city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider donating $100,000, which would be used to fix up 
office space in the Civic Arts Plaza to house the telecommunications project. 
The city has already contributed $14,000 to secure a matching-funds grant from 
the state and federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Schillo said he is eager to support the project, which 
includes an "exploratorium" stocked with the latest high-tech equipment.  
</P>
<P>
 Using the city's Air Quality Fund, he said, is "a natural, because when people 
use this technology, it means they're not driving around" and polluting the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Elois Zeanah has raised concern that the program would not 
effectively boot drivers off the street. Air Quality Fund money, which is 
usually extracted from developers, should be used to support projects that are 
guaranteed to reduce car trips, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What documentation does the city have that this program will work?" Zeanah 
asked. STEPHANIE SIMON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VOTER REGISTRATION TO END ON TUESDAY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County election officials are reminding residents that next Tuesday is 
the deadline for registering to vote in the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents can pick up registration cards at city halls, libraries, fire 
stations and post offices, said Bruce Bradley, the county's chief elections 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, there are 345,346 registered voters in the county, Bradley said. Of 
those, 151,821 are Republican and 142,795 are Democrat, with the remaining 
divided among several other parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Voter turnout in the June primary dropped to an all-time low of 33.6%. Based 
on past gubernatorial elections, voter turnout in next month's general election 
is expected to nearly double from the June figures, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the local offices up for election are two east county supervisorial 
posts, county auditor-controller and dozens of school board and city council 
seats. County voters will also be casting ballots in two congressional 
primaries and four legislative primaries. CARLOS V. LOZANO

SEARCHERS LOOK FOR MISSING HIKER, 15 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 15-year-old Thousand Oaks girl has been missing since she went hiking alone 
Sunday, authorities said. Her disappearance sparked a search Monday evening by 
the Ventura County sheriff's search and rescue unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Lennea Diederichs went hiking in the rugged 1,700-acre Wildwood Park in 
Thousand Oaks at about 3 p.m. Sunday wearing only a shirt, shorts and shoes, 
Sheriff's Sgt. Robert Sparks said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's parents reported her missing shortly after 5 p.m. Monday, Sparks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6:55 p.m., shortly after sundown, a sheriff's helicopter and a team of 15 
volunteers from the East County search and rescue team descended on the park to 
search for the missing teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's parents, Dorn and Connie Diederichs, told police that the girl, a 
student at Conejo Valley High School, is very familiar with the park's hiking 
paths, Sparks said. The Diederichs were at the park Monday evening helping the 
search and rescue team decide where to look.

WITNESSES RECALL SHOOTING OF GIRL AT YOUTH'S MURDER TRIAL; COURT: TWO TESTIFY 
THAT THE VICTIM, 16, HAD BEGGED HER BOYFRIEND NOT TO POINT GUN AT HER. 
DEFENDANT ADMITS TO THREE OF 10 FELONY CHARGES.

<P>
 Sixteen-year-old Jacqueline Reay of Thousand Oaks begged her gun-toting 
teen-age boyfriend to stop pointing the weapon at her only moments before it 
discharged and took her life, two witnesses testified Monday as the defendant's 
Juvenile Court trial began. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'Don't point the gun at me because I'm nervous around guns,' " 
testified Brandon Best, 16, who rushed to Jacqueline's aid after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's trial for the 17-year-old defendant, also from Thousand Oaks, began 
with the youth entering guilty admissions to three of the 10 felony charges in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The admissions in front of Ventura County Superior Court Judge Charles W. 
Campbell Jr. were to one count of brandishing a firearm and two counts of 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves the youth facing one count of murder, one count of brandishing a 
firearm and three counts of assault. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges are in connection with the death of Jacqueline, who died after 
being shot once in the eye with a 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun July 13, 
and other episodes of violence by the defendant over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn did not make an opening statement Monday, 
but called the husky defendant "a bully" outside court. 
</P>
<P>
 Concluding that the shooting was accidental, prosecutors have decided against 
charging the youth as an adult or seeking to have him convicted of first-degree 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 They want Campbell to find him guilty of second-degree murder and order him 
detained in a juvenile prison until the age of 25. Police said the gun was 
stolen from the boy's father, a former police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon and another teen-age witness testifying Monday supported the 
prosecution's contention that the defendant is a bully who got his thrills by 
choking smaller companions and pointing the handgun at them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 James Richardson, 13, said the defendant had intimidated him the day before 
Jacqueline's shooting death. 
</P>
<P>
 The witness said that he and several other youths were at a friend's house 
when the defendant grabbed him by the throat with one hand. 
</P>
<P>
 James testified that he had jokingly accused the defendant of wearing makeup, 
which he said did not sit well with the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 As James sat on a sofa, the defendant leaned over him and started choking him 
for about 30 seconds, cutting off his air, James said. Later, he said, the 
defendant pulled his black handgun on another teen-ager, asking, "Would you be 
scared if I pointed it at your head right now?" 
</P>
<P>
 On the day of Jacqueline's death, James said he was at another friend's 
condominium watching a videocassette of "Wayne's World" when the defendant 
arrived about noon. For several hours, the defendant had been pointing the 
firearm at Jacqueline, who pushed the barrel away and pleaded with him to stop, 
witnesses testified. 
</P>
<P>
 According to James, the defendant told Jacqueline, "If I shot you in the leg 
right now, it would hurt so bad that you would want me to kill you." 
</P>
<P>
 After being threatened by the defendant several times, Jacqueline went to the 
upstairs of the two-story condominium and took a shower. The defendant followed 
her halfway up the stairs, pointing the gun at her all the while, the witnesses 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 They said Jacqueline, a dark-haired, effervescent girl, was shot when she 
returned to the downstairs portion of the home after showering. 
</P>
<P>
 James said that Jacqueline had walked into the kitchen when the defendant, 
from the living room, pointed the gun in that direction and shot her. Brandon, 
the other witness, said he did not even realize that Jacqueline had returned 
downstairs after the shower. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon learned she was in the kitchen only after he ran in there once the 
defendant had fired the gun. Brandon said he had hoped the only damage would be 
a hole in the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Brandon told the judge in a soft voice, he found his friend 
Jacqueline shot once in the head and slumped on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, you shot her!" Brandon said he yelled to the defendant, whom he added 
seemed stunned by his act. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was like in shock or something," Brandon said. "His hand was still in the 
air, and he was looking toward the kitchen. He wasn't moving or nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As his friends testified against him, the defendant mostly hung his head. 
Friends of both the victim and the defendant are attending the trial, as are 
the defendant's parents, who sat directly behind their son Monday in the first 
row of the court gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial, which continues today, is expected to last until the end of the 
week.

CITY TO DISCUSS SITE WITH NATIVE AMERICANS; THOUSAND OAKS: OFFICIALS AGREE TO 
ANSWER ACCUSATIONS THAT THEY HID THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BONES FOUND IN WHAT SOME 
SAY IS A BURIAL GROUND. 
</P>

<P>
 Thousand Oaks city and park officials agreed Monday to meet with Chumash 
leaders to answer accusations that they hid the importance of human bones 
unearthed on Lang Ranch to make sure a park was built there. 
</P>
<P>
 City planner Greg Smith insisted, meanwhile, that a review of facts will clear 
the city of any wrongdoing. And park officials said the dispute was the result 
of miscommunication between two branches of the local Native American 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials said a meeting would help clarify the significance of the bones 
found on an eight-acre ranch parcel four years ago, and determine if anything 
should be done to protect what Chumash think is an ancient cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to work in concert with everyone involved," said Tex Ward, general 
manager of the Conejo Recreation and Park District. "Our motives are pure, and 
I hope everyone comes to the table with that understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward said the district planned to build a park on the land because he and a 
Chumash representative agreed that was the best way to prevent developers from 
building homes there. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Angulo, a Native American present when the bones were reburied, 
confirmed that he advised Ward to build the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said they would only put trees on top of the burial ground, and that the 
baseball diamond and soccer field would go on another part of the land," Angulo 
said. "We all felt that decision would save the land from having homes built on 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Native Americans have opposed the construction of a park, fearing 
playing fields and picnic areas would be located atop the site where bones were 
unearthed in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 They said Monday they would urge park officials to leave the land entirely 
undeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe what's there is a cemetery, and I don't think anything should go 
there," said Paul Varela, director of the Native American Interpretive Center 
in Thousand Oaks. "We need to sit down with them and get this worked out, so 
everyone is in agreement."

 Last Friday, angry Native Americans accused city and park officials of 
misrepresenting the importance of the discovered bones to ensure that a 
neighborhood park was built. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting the previous evening, city officials told some Chumash that the 
city had re-evaluated the importance of the bone fragments and beads and 
determined they were not part of a Chumash cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 That conclusion was disputed by a city-approved archeologist who made the 
actual discovery. He said no more bones were found only because the park 
district asked him to halt his inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ward said Monday that the archeologist, William Clewlow, and local Chumash 
agreed in 1990 that further excavation would only damage the burial sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Disagreement within the local Native American community has made matters more 
complicated than necessary, Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough when you've got two or three factions that disagree," he said. 
"But we have to look at this from the grand view of things." 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether it's a burial ground or not," he said, "I think it's clear, given the 
alternative, that a park is the most appropriate design for this land." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith declined to comment fully until he gathered all the facts, but said "the 
city has done nothing wrong, and the record will bear that out." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Some local Native Americans said last week that the city violated state law by 
failing to contact the Ventura County coroner and the California Native 
American Heritage Commission when the human remains were originally found. 
</P>
<P>
 But Angulo said he had called the Heritage Commission about the find. Larry 
Myers, the commission's executive secretary, said he found no record of the 
contact. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of issues that need to be hashed out and resolved," said 
Councilman Frank Schillo, who requested the meeting. "I hope we can work this 
out to everyone's satisfaction."

COUNCIL TO HEAR DEBATE ON PLANS TO FILL POSSIBLE VACANCY; ELECTIONS: THOUSAND 
OAKS POLITICIANS DISCUSS HOW TO REPLACE FRANK SCHILLO IF HE BECOMES A COUNTY 
SUPERVISOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jostling over potential political opportunity, Thousand Oaks politicians and 
council candidates tonight will debate the fairest way to fill Councilman Frank 
Schillo's seat should he win election to the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 If Schillo moves on to represent Thousand Oaks in county government, he will 
vacate his council seat midway through a four-year term. To replace him, the 
newly-elected council members could either tap an outsider to join them on the 
dais, or they could call a special election -- at a cost of about $95,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Alex Fiore has urged his successors to save the money and simply appoint 
a new council member. And to avoid partisan bickering, Fiore has suggested 
elevating the candidate who polls fourth in November's election to join the top 
three vote getters and Jaime Zukowski on the reconstituted council. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore will put his suggestion up for a vote at tonight's meeting. The current 
council has no authority over the disposition of Schillo's seat -- only the 
newly-elected council members can call a special election or make an 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fiore, who retires at the end of this year, hopes his colleagues will pass 
a resolution urging the future council to heed his advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing against him, Councilwoman Elois Zeanah said she would prefer a special 
election, which she considers the purest form of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have heard some good business people say they would consider running for a 
two-year term, but their commitments will not allow them to run for a full 
term," said Zeanah, who is up for reelection. "We may get a completely 
different group of candidates for a special election." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both Zeanah and Zukowski have called on Schillo to resign now, rather than 
leave the council's composition in limbo. And they remain unconvinced that he 
will win his supervisorial race against attorney Trudi Loh.  
</P>
<P>
 "Discussing this now is ridiculous," Zeanah said. "No one has ever shown me 
any polls indicating that Schillo is a front-runner." 
</P>
<P>
 But the prospect of a Schillo victory has clearly set his would-be successors 
to thinking about the future. The issue has divided the 16 council candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to rally support for a quick appointment, rather than a special 
election, retired business manager Marshall Dixon has written all candidates 
urging them to back Fiore's proposal. "I feel this is a practical and 
reasonable approach," Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon's letter has earned support from fellow candidates Michael Friedman, 
David Hare, M. Ali Issari, Lee Laxdal, Chuck Morsa and Bill Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 They predict voters will not take much interest in a special election next 
spring, especially after the bombardment of campaign literature this fall. They 
fear that donors, too, will be spent from the fall battles and unwilling to 
subsidize fresh campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who comes in fourth in this (November) election would probably get 
more votes than the winner of a special election" due to voter apathy in the 
second round, former Councilman Laxdal said. The estimated $95,000 cost, he 
added, "goes a long way toward hiring another policeman."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lobbying for a special election, despite the price tag, are candidates Greg 
Cole, Ekbal Quidwai, Irving Wasserman and Zeanah. "Democracy has never been 
cheap," Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other candidates, Andy Fox said he would prefer a special election, 
unless an appointment earned "overwhelming support from members of the 
community." Mike Markey said he had not yet decided. Incumbent Judy Lazar and 
challenger Jeannette Scovill could not be reached for comment.

RECRUITING / JEFF FELLENZER: INGLEWOOD'S PIERCE GROWS INTO TOP PROSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FELLENZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago, during a holiday basketball tournament in Chino, Paul Pierce, a 
6-foot-4 sophomore forward from Inglewood High, arrived at a crossroads in his 
young career. 
</P>
<P>
 Since arriving from the junior varsity that season, Pierce's impact on a 
program that has produced such college and NBA stars as Harold Miner, Reggie 
Theus, Jay Humphries and Ralph Jackson had been, well, nil. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was on the verge of being cut," Inglewood Coach Patrick Roy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then three of Inglewood's top post players had to miss the next tournament 
game -- all because of family obligations -- and there were no other options 
but to play a struggling 10th-grader. 
</P>
<P>
 Much to the surprise of his teammates and coaches, Pierce sparked an Inglewood 
victory that night. 
</P>
<P>
 He averaged 14 points for the rest of the season, and followed that with 
averages of 23 points and 11 rebounds as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he is the consensus choice among college coaches and talent scouts as the 
top senior prospect in California, joining an elite trio that includes 6-10 
Jelani McCoy of San Diego St. Augustine -- who gave an oral commitment to UCLA 
recently -- and 6-5 Tommy Prince of Compton Dominguez. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce has grown another inch since last season, and at 6-7 and 200 pounds, 
seems to have the skills and savvy to play guard in college. It's his 
versatility -- as a scorer, passer and rebounder -- that has drawn comparisons 
to former Arizona All-American Sean Elliott, now with the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever you need on offense, he can do it," one Pac-10 assistant coach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on his play at the ABCD Camp in Teaneck, N.J., and other summer 
tournaments, Pierce was chosen one of the nation's top 25 players by Bob 
Gibbons of All-Star Sports Report, a basketball recruiting publication in 
Lenoir, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince also made the list, while Mater Dei's Schea Cotton was one of two 
non-seniors -- and the only sophomore -- selected. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce also held his own while playing in pickup games at UCLA over the 
summer, when the competition often included current and former Bruin players 
and pros such as Olden Polynice, Mark Jackson and Sedale Threatt. 
</P>
<P>
 Former UCLA guard Shon Tarver told an observer that he assumed Pierce was an 
NBA player too. 
</P>
<P>
 After one game, Threatt complimented him on his talents. "That made me feel 
great," said Pierce, whose older brother, Jamal Hosey, played basketball at 
Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 No surprise, then, that Pierce has been contacted by virtually every top 
college program in the country. Dean Smith and John Chaney have called; Indiana 
and Michigan are among many that have written. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce has narrowed the list of colleges he is considering to six -- Kansas, 
UCLA, USC, California, Arizona and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he has not yet scored high enough on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (he 
scored 650 on his first try, and is scheduled to retake the exam on Saturday), 
Pierce cannot take any paid campus visits. Thus, he says, he will almost 
certainly wait until the spring before signing a letter of intent. Basketball 
players can also sign during the Nov. 9-16 signing period. 
</P>
<P>
 He denied the validity of a recent radio report that said he had already 
orally committed to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce did agree to handicap his short list of colleges (in no particular 
order): 
</P>
<P>
 * Kansas: "I liked Kansas, and especially Danny Manning, before I ever knew 
that I would be good enough to play in college. Roy Williams is one of the best 
coaches in America." 
</P>
<P>
 * UCLA: "Great academics, tradition, and it's close to home. Lately, it seems 
that most of the top players in California are going there." 
</P>
<P>
 * USC: "I like George Raveling a lot. He was one of the first coaches to show 
interest in me. He also spoke at our (Inglewood High basketball) banquet last 
year. Plus it's close to home." 
</P>
<P>
 * Cal: "Cal is a program on the rise. They've had some good recruiting 
classes. Young coaches, and good academics, too." 
</P>
<P>
 * Arizona: "I like Coach (Lute) Olson, and I think the style of play fits me. 
He told me he might play me at point guard sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 * Oregon: "They were one of the first schools to start recruiting me. I like 
the coaches; they have been very honest. And they graduate their players. In 
the near future, I think they'll have a pretty good team." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei shooting guard Clay McKnight has a scholarship offer from UC Irvine, 
but will probably wait until the spring before signing. He also likes Syracuse 
and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate Shaun Jackson, a 6-7 power forward, is considering Washington State 
(where brother Ray, a former Mater Dei player, is a defensive back on the 
football team) and Nevada Las Vegas, among others. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Though the weeklong early-signing period is only five weeks away, many of the 
nation's most heavily recruited players are still awaiting academic clearance 
from the new NCAA Clearinghouse before they can take paid recruiting visits. 
One school that managed to work around that restriction was Cal, which shocked 
the college basketball community recently by receiving an oral commitment from 
6-9 forward Shareef Abdur-Rahim of Marietta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdur-Rahim, one of the top half-dozen players in the country, took an 
unofficial (i.e., not paid by the host school) trip to the Bay Area, then 
announced his decision to attend Cal within days after returning home. He made 
no official recruiting visits before picking Cal, leaving behind an angry trail 
of coaches from schools such as Georgia Tech, Duke, North Carolina, Arkansas, 
USC and Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Cal: The Bears also have a commitment from 6-3 guard Ed Gray, a former 
Riverside North star who left Tennessee after averaging 15 points as a freshman 
last season. Gray is now trying to boost his grades at the College of Southern 
Idaho in Twin Falls, Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA, with four scholarships to offer, has received commitments from 6-1 guard 
Brandon Loyd of Tulsa, Okla., and 6-10 center-forward Jelani McCoy. The Bruins 
could have their second consecutive top-10 recruiting class by signing at least 
one of their two remaining prime targets: Paul Pierce or Tommy Prince. Also in 
the picture is 6-8 swingman Jason Klein of Grosse Ile, Mich. Klein, an 
excellent shooter, has narrowed his choices to Michigan State and UCLA. He 
visited Westwood Sept. 23-25. 
</P>
<P>
 USC also has four scholarships, with one committed to 6-1 guard Damion Dawson 
of Long Beach Poly. The Trojans, in search of inside help, have been actively 
recruiting in Georgia, where Coach George Raveling has numerous contacts. One 
recent visitor to USC was 6-10 Kenyon Jones of Savannah, Ga. Jones was 
scheduled to visit Minnesota last weekend, and has a trip planned to Cal this 
weekend. Another Georgia star, 6-7 Juan Gaston of Decatur, has a trip planned 
to USC, Oct. 21-23. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent Pac-10 oral commitments include: 5-11 Arthur Lee of North Hollywood, 
who chose Stanford over Arizona; 6-foot Jason Terry of Seattle and 6-4 Donald 
Watts of Kirkland, Wash., two national recruits who picked Washington, and 6-3 
Lenny Holly of New Mexico Junior College in Hobbs, N.M., who picked Arizona 
State over New Mexico. Holly, who visited UCLA last month, told friends he 
wanted to sign with the Bruins, but did not think he would have the necessary 
credits by next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Stanford: If he is admitted academically, 6-10 Andy McClelland of Tempe, 
Ariz., will likely pick the Cardinal over Washington State.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; BREZA'S LOOK, GAME ARE STRIKINGLY FAMILIAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tangle of long, red hair and the red goatee. The way he flies through the 
air and slams his head into a soccer ball. They all add up to the inevitable 
comparisons to U.S. World Cup star Alexi Lalas. 
</P>
<P>
 Most, however, are not complimentary. But Rich Breza can deal with those who 
say he's a wanna-be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I get it a lot," he said. "We play similarly, in the air a lot. Of 
course, it's the whole look, but I've had the long hair since I was a freshman 
in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I miss a header, though, it's always, 'Oh, Lalas missed that one.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Breza, Irvine's No. 2 scorer with four goals and five assists, didn't miss 
last week against UCLA when he scored on a header that helped upset the Bruins, 
second ranked at the time, 4-3. The goal didn't quiet the Bruins, but it 
knocked them down to 10th in the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 "P.J. (Polowski) and I just kept listening to them talk and looking at each 
other like 'Let's wait until this is over before we say a thing,' " Breza said. 
"Guys marking me are always making comments, but talking smack is not really my 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Breza's game, which Coach Derek Lawther describes as "rough and tough," was 
showcased only in club games last year. Breza, 22, was majoring in political 
science at Long Beach State and playing with the Costa Mesa Hiberians. 
</P>
<P>
 He had some offers to play at small schools after his second year at MiraCosta 
College in San Diego but decided to concentrate on getting his degree. He moved 
into an apartment in Newport Beach below Jeff Fischbeck, a senior midfielder 
for the Anteaters, and started playing some summer pickup games with the 
Anteater players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched him play a couple of times with the Hiberians," Lawther said. "He 
was very good in the air, but he didn't look fit. I thought he would be a great 
target man who could rough it up. We found out he had a year (of eligibility) 
left and brought him in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't sure if he had the pace for Division I, but it's worked out because 
he's been a workaholic since the first day of preseason training. He's really 
gotten himself fit." 
</P>
<P>
 Polowski, a senior transfer who is two goals shy of tying the Anteaters' 
career record after only 1 1/2 seasons, and Breza have become best friends and 
a perfect combination of finesse and force. 
</P>
<P>
 "P.J. is everything I'm not and sort of vice versa," Breza said. "He's very 
quick and is always buzzing around everywhere. But he's thin and not that 
strong. I'm a little more stationary and they play the ball up to me and then 
P.J. runs off me." 
</P>
<P>
 Polowski scored 11 goals last season; he has nine this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "P.J. took all the heat last year," Lawther said. "He was double-teamed 
everywhere he went. Rich can pull two players together and P.J. can play off 
him and get one-on-one. It doesn't happen as often as I'd like, but it is 
happening this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Breza has wanted to play Division I soccer since his first year at Fallbrook 
High and the culmination of his dream was highlighted by the victory over UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beating UCLA was so awesome," he said. "All your life, you hear about UCLA 
and there are guys playing there that I played against in high school. There 
are a lot of politics in soccer. If you don't play on the right club team, then 
you don't get to the right college." 
</P>
<P>
 So Breza considers himself fortunate for his second chance. Like Lalas, many 
doubted he was talented enough. But, like Lalas, his knack for getting his head 
on the ball has paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Say what? Breza on the game plan against the Bruins: "UCLA obviously has 
better skill and they're probably one of the fittest teams in the country, so 
we sat back, collapsed, pushed out and counter-attacked, you know, kind of 
Romanian style." 
</P>
<P>
 We're nodding like we know. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A moving experience: Breza is an avid surfer who was riding waves before he 
was riding a bike. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't realize that surfing is one of the most physical sports and 
easily the hardest sport," he said. "I play golf, I've played baseball and 
basketball, but surfing is the most difficult. First, there's wave judgment and 
then the wave's moving, the board's moving and you're moving." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All good things: Irvine's seven-game winning streak ended Sunday night when 
the Anteaters lost to San Diego, 3-1. The Anteaters are 8-2 and still feeling 
pretty good about themselves, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "We met a good team and they went up (by) two quickly," Lawther said. "But the 
last 20 minutes were ours. We had loads of shots. Their keeper was really on 
and saved a couple of bombs. Then they broke away for one in the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it wasn't a drubbing or anything." Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Director of Soccer/Head Women's Coach Marine Cano is keeping a close eye on 
the men's program and he likes what he sees. "I think they have two things that 
they've never had here, character and discipline," he said. "They never quit. 
They just need to learn how to finish, which is the same problem we're facing 
on the women's side." . . . The sailing team is ranked fifth in the nation in 
Sailing World magazine's preseason poll. Junior Andy Beeckman finished second 
in the Pacific Coast Singlehanded Championships off Newport Beach during the 
weekend and will compete in the Singlehanded National Championships, Nov. 4-6, 
hosted by St. Mary's (Md.) College. . . . Sophomore Shawn Morley finished 
second in the Grand Canyon Classic with a three-under-par 70-71-72 213 to lead 
the Anteaters to the tournament title last week at the Hillcrest Golf & Country 
Club in Sun City West, Ariz. Cal State Northridge and Utah tied for second in 
the 17-team tournament. . . . Assistant Greg Vetrone on the state of Anteater 
basketball: "Right now, I'm optimistic. And if I'm optimistic, you know we must 
be better."

<P>
 Tandy Gillis and Alan Sawyer, former men's basketball coaches at Orange Coast, 
are making news this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillis, who was forced to step down as head coach at Orange Coast two years 
ago, will work as a walk-on assistant at Irvine Valley this season. Gillis 
joins the staff of Coach Bill Mulligan. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillis coached basketball at Orange Coast from 1976-92. His 1978-79 OCC team 
went 27-5 and won the State title. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillis played on California's 1959 national championship team and also was a 
member of the 1960 runner-up team. 
</P>
<P>
 He coached eight seasons at Corona del Mar High before going to OCC. 
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer, who coached Orange Coast from 1957-66, is being inducted into the San 
Pedro Sportswalk, which is similar to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer was an all-city player at San Pedro High in 1945. He then went on to 
play on John Wooden's first team at UCLA. He was an honorable mention 
All-American for the Bruins in 1948-49 and 1949-50. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando Valenzuela, Cheryl Miller and San Pedro baseball legend Joe Lovitto 
will be inducted with Sawyer in the Oct. 24 ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer, 66, lives in Newport Beach with his wife, Diane. He is still a math 
teacher at OCC. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 On a rampage: Rancho Santiago's Matt Padgett has started the wrestling season 
right where he left off last year. Padgett, from Canyon High, won the State 
title last year in the 167-pound division and was 32-3 overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Padgett is 14-0 this season and pinned all four opponents to win the Cerritos 
tournament Saturday. He had also pinned all four opponents in winning the 
Fresno tournament the previous week. He was selected the tournament's most 
outstanding wrestler at Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hired: Lance Stewart has been selected men's volleyball coach at Irvine 
Valley. Stewart takes over for Tom Pestolesi, who led the Lasers to the State 
title in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart also is the girls' coach at Corona del Mar High. He coached at Rancho 
Santiago for two seasons (1991-92) before the program was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, a graduate of California, was a standout in volleyball and football 
at Laguna Beach High. He also played football at Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Women's volleyball: Golden West, which has won three of the last four State 
titles, has yet to lose a game in five matches this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rustlers have one of Coach Al Gasparian's deepest teams, and it's a good 
thing because standout outside hitter Becca Foltz has played in only one match. 
</P>
<P>
 Foltz, from Foothill High, injured stomach muscles in a scrimmage three weeks 
ago. Gasparian said she could have played last week if necessary but he decided 
to let her rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West will see the top teams from Northern California this weekend when 
the Rustlers take part in the College of the Sequoias tournament in Visalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback is also off to a 5-0 start. The Gauchos beat Fullerton in three 
games in an Orange Empire Conference opener Friday. Saddleback plays at 
Riverside Wednesday, then at Cypress Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Cunerty, golf coach at Saddleback, was selected the 1993-94 Orange Empire 
Conference coach of the year for all sports. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection was made by the conference athletic directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunerty's golf team dominated last season, going 21-1 in conference matches. 
His team won the Southern California title by 15 strokes and the State title by 
25. 
</P>
<P>
 His teams have won four State titles and 12 conference titles in 13 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Football poll: Rancho Santiago, after impressive victories over Palomar and 
Long Beach in the last two weeks, became the first Orange County team to make 
an appearance in the weekly Southland Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons (2-1) are sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield (4-0) is No. 1, El Camino (3-0) is second, Cerritos (3-0) third, 
Mt. San Antonio (2-0-1) fourth, Los Angeles Valley (4-0) fifth, Long Beach 
(3-1) seventh, Palomar (2-1) eighth, Ventura (3-0) ninth and Mt. San Jacinto 
(3-0-1) 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Women's soccer: The Golden West team is in danger of disbanding because of a 
lack of healthy players. The Rustlers have lost six players this season and are 
down to eight. 
</P>
<P>
 The team forfeited its game against Cypress last Friday and will do the same 
for today's game against Orange Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is being evaluated on a day-to-day basis by the school.

LONG BEACH STATE NOTEBOOK / JASON REID; FEAR IS GONE, BUT 49ER VOLLEYBALL STILL 
FORMIDABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No question about it, the women's volleyball team is not perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are the days, and there were many, when Coach Brian Gimmillaro's 49ers 
would just show up at opponents' gyms, spike a few balls in warm-ups and breeze 
through matches. What's more, visiting teams don't recoil in fear nearly as 
much as they used to. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared with past teams, the 49ers need some molding. Nothing drastic like a 
complete overhaul, mind you, but Gimmillaro has some tinkering to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not as good as we were last year at this point; no doubt about that," 
Gimmillaro said. "This team needs to improve more than any team we've had in a 
long time." 
</P>
<P>
 However, dark days aren't on the horizon. Actually, the next sign of serious 
trouble will be the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Gimmillaro guided Long Beach to the NCAA title last season. The 49ers also won 
the 1989 national championship under Gimmillaro and have advanced to the last 
three final fours. 
</P>
<P>
 And they're in motion again. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (9-3, 5-1 in the Big West Conference) is ranked ninth in the nation 
after splitting its last two matches. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers defeated Cal State Fullerton on Friday, 15-2, 15-2, 15-9. They lost 
their first conference match Saturday to fellow perennial power UC Santa 
Barbara, 11-15, 15-10, 15-12, 6-15, 15-7. Long Beach has lost only three of 60 
conference matches the last four seasons; two to Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Santa Barbara) plays us harder than they play any other team," Gimmillaro 
said. "It was very exciting because there were a lot of runs. They just played 
a little better." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the matches against Fullerton and Santa Barbara marked the first time 
Long Beach played consecutive road matches against different opponents this 
season, Gimmillaro dismissed fatigue as a factor. Continuing the theme, more 
work is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put pressure on myself and on the team for every point," Gimmillaro said. 
"It's pressure but it's not negative pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we improving at a good rate? Yes. Are we capable of doing better? Yes. 
We'll just have to see if we can get good enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Past performances indicate the work will get done. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Top player? A 49er has been selected as national player of the year in four of 
the last six years, and Gimmillaro believes that number should grow by one. 
Long Beach is promoting senior outside hitter Nichelle Burton for this season's 
award. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton (5 feet 10), who specializes in kills, was a first-team All-American 
selection last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bigger the game," Gimmillaro said, "the more she wants the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Burton, a native of Phoenix, is skilled in building support: She is the first 
49er captain to be unanimously selected, Gimmillaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No more doctors: Nothing personal, but water polo Coach Ken Lindgren would 
rather not deal with people carrying penlights and medical charts for oh, say, 
the rest of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of Lindgren's starters have injuries (back problems, shoulder problems, 
hand problems, etc.) that might keep them out for the rest of the season. 
Another starter is suffering from some sort of stress-related disorder that has 
doctors recommending he give up competitive sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the mounting list of unavailable players, the optimism Lindgren 
experienced at the beginning of the season has been crushed. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers are 2-11, 0-4 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. They were 
6-18, 1-9 last season, but believed better times were ahead because of several 
strong returners and a 10-player recruiting class. Lindgren redshirted the 
entire recruiting class. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were pretty confident we were going to be doggone good this year," 
Lindgren said. "If I'd known we'd have this many injuries I would have probably 
played some of these younger kids to get them experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "But to pull them off their redshirt seasons now isn't going to help us any." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Running man: Cross-country Coach Andy Sythe is pleased with freshman Pat 
Bendzick, who at the Stanford Invitational Saturday ran one of the all-time 
fastest course times by a 49er. 
</P>
<P>
 Bendzick finished the 8,000-meter course in 26 minutes 37 seconds, good for 
58th place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pat did a terrific job," Sythe said. "He now knows he can run with the top 
people." Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach will host a basketball clinic Oct. 21-22. Men's basketball Coach 
Seth Greenberg will direct the clinic, which is open to coaches of all levels. 
Registration is $30. More information: (310) 985-8185.

TITANS' BROWN OUT FOR SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton soccer player Demian Brown will be out the rest of the 
season because of a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee.Brown was 
injured in Sunday's 2-0 loss to Portland in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a junior defender from Diamond Bar, has started 45 games for the Titans 
in three seasons and helped lead Fullerton to a 16-7 record and the semifinals 
of the NCAA playoffs last season. Coach Al Mistri called Brown's injury "a 
devastating loss." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton is 6-3-1 this year and 1-0 in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation 
play.

SCOTT HARRIS: EISNER'S BRILLIANT FLANKING MANEUVER; A FEW YEARS FROM NOW, THEY

<P>
 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
 500 South Buena Vista St. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank, CA 91521-7320 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Mr. Eisner: 
</P>
<P>
 My compliments, sir, on another smart move. 
</P>
<P>
 I am speaking, of course, of your prudent decision to shelve plans for 
building "Disney's America" a few miles from the Manassas battlefields. I must 
admit that your previous insistence on the original site in such a historic 
area had us worried. Frankly, it was not hard to imagine the headlines that 
might have been written in the year 2001: " 'Disney's America' Defeats 
'Stonewall' Eisner." 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the press, those scumsuckers, love rise-and-fall stories. Their 
Disney files are fat with the downside of 1994 -- the death of Frank Wells, 
your quadruple bypass surgery, the departure of Jeffrey Katzenberg, the red ink 
at Euro Disney. It's been a hell of a year, all right -- and for you, a pivotal 
year. Whatever happens from here on out -- whether Disney falters or zooms 
onward and upward -- will decide whether you will be remembered as a true titan 
of business or just one lucky son-of-a-gun. (This is, I realize, extremely 
unfair, given your 1993 earnings. Isn't $203.1 million ample proof of genius?) 
</P>
<P>
 So be careful. Those hacks at Variety and Vanity Fair and the Wall Street 
Journal are itching to see you fail. We are talking about an insensitive breed 
here. I'm sure many have extended sincere wishes for your full and complete 
recovery. But they have ulterior motives. A few years from now, they want to 
point to a fit Michael Eisner and a struggling Disney. Then they'll look back 
on '94 and say, "See, Frank Wells was the Aladdin of Disney! Jeffrey Katzenberg 
was The Profit King!" They want to say that Emperor Eisner has no clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake: This reporter is in your corner. Your decision to find 
another location for "Disney's America" has reaffirmed my faith that you'll 
rise to the challenge. True, the press plays up the battlefield metaphors, 
saying you raised a "white flag" of surrender. Hah! This was a brilliant 
flanking maneuver that will win new allies and protects the valuable Disney 
image as you stake out an acceptable location. Gen. Lee would be impressed! 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure of this because my Aunt Jack was certainly impressed. She lives on a 
road called Gen. Longstreet's Line, just outside the Manassas battlefield. When 
I visited her this summer, she was mighty upset with you. You see, she's 79 
years old -- old enough to still remember a childhood conversation with 
veterans of the Civil -- oops! I mean the War Between the States. One of my 
great-great-uncles lost a few fingers fighting the Yankees at Manassas. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as I heard the good news about Disney's America, I called Aunt Jack. 
Aunt Izetta, up from Birmingham for a spell, answered the phone and explained 
Aunt Jack was busy collecting signatures to have a new elementary school named 
after her neighbor, Mr. B. Oswald Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Robinson, I must say, helped me appreciate our heritage more than any 
theme park could. When I met him this summer, he told me what it was like 
growing up on the old family farm on the battlefield -- how the plow blade 
would turn up the bones of Union soldiers who were buried where they fell. Mr. 
Robinson is a regular pillar of the community, a man who traces his roots to a 
relationship between a plantation owner and a slave woman. He's 84 and he's the 
only African American who lives in Aunt Jack's neighborhood. Lincoln may have 
freed the slaves, but it wasn't until 1965, a full century after Lee's 
surrender, that integration came to the schools of Fairfax County, Va. Mr. 
Robinson was the principal of the only all-black school to be integrated with 
white children; several other schools were in such disrepair they were used for 
storage. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, when Aunt Jack finally came to the phone, she said she was "ecstatic" 
about your decision. She'd been all over the neighborhood with her petition and 
"everybody I talked to except one person -- well, two -- are really excited 
about Disney not being there." 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure the Virginia experience has been taxing for you, but don't forget 
there are many places that would welcome Disney and Mr. Michael Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
 We missed our chance with Gorman. The little truck stop up I-5, on the way to 
Bakersfield, has been taken off the market. 
</P>
<P>
 So now we'll have to find a new site for the dream I call "Ei erland." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, you've been very busy these last few months. There's no need to 
apologize for your failure to respond to my letter last spring proposing the 
construction of an adult-oriented theme park. Now, by "adult-oriented" I 
certainly don't mean to suggest it would be X-rated -- not entirely, anyway. 
Rather, Ei erland would be a playground with limos, Lear jets and celebrity 
look-alikes -- vicarious ya-yas for people who can only wish to make $203.1 
million in a lifetime. Or twenty lifetimes, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm still authorized to commit the Harris Family fortune toward this dream. 
I'm sure it will take only a fraction of your 1993 income to make the down 
payment on a suitable location -- perhaps the old General Motors plant in Van 
Nuys. Rest assured that historians won't get in a lather talking about "the 
hallowed ground" around that spot. (Again, since I'm assuming the greater 
financial risk, it follows that I should control 51% of the company.) 
</P>
<P>
 Think about it. We're talking high concept. We're talking about a new company 
and a new monument that will give Mr. Michael Eisner his due, free from the 
legends of Walt Disney, Frank Wells and Jeffrey Katzenberg. And maybe the media 
slime will swallow their cynicism. 
</P>
<P>
 Sincerely, 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Harris 
</P>
<P>
 P.S. -- It occurs to me that "Ei erland" may sound a tad gauche. What do think 
of "Eisner's America"?

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; PROGRAM HELPS CHILDREN 
AT RISK OF ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 When Anita Hanna finishes her day's work as an emergency room nurse at Kaiser 
Permanente Medical Center in Panorama City, she can relax and be a "grandma." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna does not have grandchildren, but said a child started calling her that 
because she's "nice" and has "grandma hair." 
</P>
<P>
 The youngster is in the child-abuse prevention program COSTARS for which Hanna 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna said her job as a nurse is "really high pressure and sometimes it's 
really depressing." She has been working at the hospital for 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Her COSTARS work offers a reprieve from the often-violent reality of everyday 
life. "It's like being in a group of fun, nice little angels," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekly program, held on Tuesdays at Tujunga's Pinewood Elementary School, 
is for children age 12 and younger from single-parent families. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is overseen by Bridge Focus a nonprofit Burbank agency that tries 
to keep children from becoming victims of abuse. Its Single Parent Connection 
program helps parents to deal with problems without resorting to violence. And 
at COSTARS, children are encouraged to express themselves to build self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a family better able to handle, and avoid, conflict, said 
volunteer coordinator Shelli Duby. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to prevent child abuse by showing the children alternative behaviors 
and problem-solving skills," Duby said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, fights may start as family members start blaming each other for 
problems. "Why aren't you doing your homework?" or "Why aren't you home?" are 
questions that can escalate into arguments if they are not handled 
appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 In their 2 1/2-hour shifts, volunteers help children with projects that help 
them tap into feelings about themselves and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to be good listeners," Duby said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna has seen the children change dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some nights I get off of work and I'm tired," Hanna said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I go every (Tuesday) night. After you leave there, you feel so good." 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call Duby at (818) 563-5509.

 Nursery Nature Walks, an environmental education organization for educators 
and families with children age 8 and younger, needs volunteers. Three training 
sessions are scheduled: Saturday at Temescal Canyon in the Pacific Palisades, 
Oct. 15 at Topanga State Park and Oct. 22 at Coldwater Canyon Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers pay $40 -- or less, depending on ability to pay -- for the 
training. They must attend all three sessions to qualify as volunteer guides, 
although they can make up the course work later if they miss a class.  
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers lead walks throughout the Santa Monica Mountains and northern Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The program conducts 40 to 50 walks a month, as well as three to four 
"outreach walks," for inner-city children. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call Nursery Nature Walk director Judy Burns or Kathy 
Tardy at (310) 998-1151.

</P>
<P>
 Free, no-obligation training for prospective hospice volunteers is being 
offered at Mission Community Hospital in Panorama City by the Olsten Kimberly 
Qualitycare Hospice. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainers include communications experts, social workers, bereavement 
counselors and medical personnel. Volunteers are needed to make friendly visits 
and phone calls to terminally ill patients and their families throughout the 
San Fernando Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 Training begins Oct. 29 at the hospital at 14850 Roscoe Blvd., Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
 Preregistration is required. For more information, call volunteer services 
director Lucki Baxter at (310) 475-3442. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting Involved is a weekly listing of volunteering opportunities. Please 
address prospective listings to Getting Involved, Los Angeles Times, 20000

 But will they be able to find any male judges?For the first time in 41 years, 
the Miss Downey Pageant has eliminated the swimsuit competition, which was 
deemed outmoded for the young woman of today. Instead, the fully garbed 
contestants will be graded on such factors as poise, personality and oratorical 
skills. They'll also have the option of writing a 150-word essay on the theme, 
"What's Right With the Youth of Today." 
</P>
<P>
 That many words?

 More devastating than any poll: We're no political pundit, especially after 
predicting that Melrose Larry Green would be elected mayor of L.A. last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But we don't think it's a good sign for the Democrats that a whole bin of 
Clinton CD ROMs selling for three bucks apiece (about an 85% reduction in 
price) could be found in a local Pic 'N' Save. We'll wait until it reaches the 
99 Cents Only stores.

 Generous to a fault: When Price Michael of Kent visited Geary's Beverly Hills,

 He lost his Pulitzer eligibility: You may have read about a controversy 
involving two freshmen USC football players -- sources say each is suspected of 
having had someone else take a college entrance examination for him. A third 
recruit's entrance test was disqualified last year. 
</P>
<P>
 We must confess that we had direct knowledge of a similar scandal when we were 
at USC. But this one involved the journalism department. A fellow Daily Trojan 
staffer had a friend take a Spanish test for him. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was caught, the DT staffer had a simple explanation. He told 
authorities he was writing an investigative piece on cheating. He had heard 
that it was simple for a student to have a substitute take a test. But -- hey! 
-- the fact that he had been caught proved it wasn't true. He congratulated the 
school on its security. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials considered expelling him but gave him a lesser penalty. Our 
classmate never did graduate from USC. But he later became a successful comedy 
writer in Hollywood. miscelLAny The book, "The Fifty Worst Movies Ever Made," 
reports that the 1972 movie, "Godzilla Versus the Smog Monster," was popular in 
Japan, where it was set. But it was a flop in this country. And it ran for only 
two days in L.A., where residents obviously found it hard to believe the story 
line, which had the smog monster being defeated.

NHL LABOR DISPUTE; OWNERS PLEADING POVERTY WHILE WRITING FAT CHECKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NHL owners, who last week warned that escalating player salaries were pushing 
them to the brink of financial disaster, seem to be ignoring their own cries of 
impending doom. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Aug. 1, when Commissioner Gary Bettman imposed economic rollbacks to 
save owners an estimated $20 million, clubs have spent about $214 million 
signing players to long-term contracts. Of that amount, they will pay $70 
million for the 1994-95 season alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the signings: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Paul Kariya of the Mighty Ducks at $6.5 million over three years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- First-round pick Jamie Storr of the Kings at $2.6 million for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pat LaFontaine of the Buffalo Sabres at $22.5 million for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jaromir Jagr of the Pittsburgh Penguins at $19.2 million for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Goalie Dominik Hasek of the Buffalo Sabres at $6.9 million for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Vince Damphousse of the Montreal Canadiens at $10 million over four years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- First-round draft pick Brett Lindros of the New York Islanders at $7.5 
million for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Restrictions on players' salaries are central to the dispute between the 
league and its players. They will meet today in New York, their first session 
since last Friday, when Bettman postponed the start of the season until Oct. 15 
to provide time for additional bargaining. If no agreement is reached by then, 
or if Bettman finds no evidence of progress, games probably will be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 An NHL source said the league did not plan to make a new proposal today, but 
that it was willing to amend previous offers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to see what they come in with," the source said. "We feel we made a 
significant move last week." 
</P>
<P>
 That move was reducing the rate of a gradual levy imposed on the payrolls of 
teams that exceed a limit. Players object to any form of levy on payrolls, 
claiming it will have a chilling effect on spending. They have proposed a flat 
5.5% levy on payrolls and gate receipts of the top 16 money-making teams. In 
either case, proceeds would be pooled to help subsidize small-market teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Players remain skeptical of owners' pleas that they need sweeping economic 
changes to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Revenues have continued to grow. Expansion teams have continued to bring in a 
tremendous amount of money for the league," said Mike Gartner of the Toronto 
Maple Leafs, president of the NHLPA. "I think it's a very healthy business." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Torrey, president of the Florida Panthers, doesn't blame players for 
doubting owners' statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was a player, I'd be questioning their figures too," he told Newsday. 
"I'd see the contracts that keep rolling out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would they believe? The last time we negotiated with Bob Goodenow, I'd 
shake my head. I was on the owners committee and every morning we'd come in to 
start negotiating and I'd open up the paper and somebody would have given 
somebody else even more money. Here we were negotiating like hell, five teams 
would open the books to show how bad things were, and we kept giving them 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 According to figures supplied by the NHLPA, in 1993-94, the average salary 
rose from $412,512 to $503,087. The number of players making $1 million or more 
has grown from fewer than five only six years ago to 75. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind paying star players," Edmonton owner Peter Pocklington said. 
"They're entertainers. But that does not mean the journeymen should share in 
the abundance if it is killing the goose that lays the golden egg." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the NHLPA's salary list, however, it's not journeymen who have 
benefited from owners' largess since Aug. 1. They also include standout 
forwards Teemu Selanne and Keith Tkachuk of the Winnipeg Jets and Edmonton 
goaltender Bill Ranford. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Pincus, the NHL's vice president for public relations, said the owners' 
spending spree "was made in anticipation, and rightly so, that we will have a 
much more liberalized free-agency system." 
</P>
<P>
 NHL players have limited free agency because clubs retain the right to match 
offers or get compensation in most cases. This kept salaries low until a few 
teams, led by the St. Louis Blues, began spending on free agents that couldn't 
-- or wouldn't -- be matched.

FATAL MYSTERY DOWN UNDER; TRAINER, 14 RACE HORSES DIE OF UNKNOWN CAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERARD WRIGHT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fourteen thoroughbreds were dead. And trainer Vic Rail, once famous for his 
association with a remarkable horse, lay critically ill in the intensive care 
section of a city hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 No cause could be established for either. There was speculation that the 
afflictions could be related, except that medical experts -- both human and 
equine -- said it was impossible for a man to catch a disease from a horse. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Queensland capital of Brisbane, where this mystery was unfolding, race 
meetings were canceled, at a cost to the industry of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 As Australian and international experts analyzed tissue and blood samples 
without being able to offer a definitive explanation, the vacuum of hard facts 
was filled by a whirlwind of speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 In Melbourne, where Rail had become such an unlikely public figure, the Age, a 
newspaper, filled in the gaps in its front-page story by resurrecting a plot 
from a novel by Englishman Dick Francis, the former jockey-turned-best-selling 
author. 
</P>
<P>
 Rail, 49, died of heart failure a week ago in Brisbane's Mater Hospital. He 
had been one trainer who would not observe the usual racing protocol of being 
purely the straight man in a performance in which the horse, if it wins, always 
gets the best notices. 
</P>
<P>
 Rail and Vo Rogue stood that practice on its head. 
</P>
<P>
 Vo Rogue was bought for $5,000, the equivalent of $3,750 in American money, as 
a weanling, the offspring of a sire and dam who had not won a race between 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, it seemed the horse would run true to its humble origins. A 
part-owner's first impression was that the horse was "a bit of a rat." 
</P>
<P>
 Vo Rogue's owners sent him to the stables run by Vic -- short for Victory -- 
Rail, one of eight children from the north Queensland city of Townsville, whose 
given name was bestowed by elated and historically minded parents to mark his 
birth date, Aug. 15, 1945, the day World War II ended when Japan agreed to 
surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 Rail was a steeplechase jockey and boxer who rode Vo Rogue in all his workouts 
at 185-195 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 And Vo Rogue soon made believers out of skeptics and fans out of spectators 
with his style of racing. 
</P>
<P>
 With each victory, and each new and successful incursion south from Brisbane, 
Melbourne's race goers took Vic and Vo ever closer to their hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 After each victory, Rail would hold court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mate," he said, after being called upon to part with some training secrets, 
"he gets no steroids, no vitamins, no nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Rail's horses also trained without shoes and would have raced that way if the 
stewards hadn't suggested otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor was Rail above reminding some of his well-connected rivals, such as 
Melbourne Cup-winning trainer Lee Freedman, what might be awaiting them. 
</P>
<P>
 "You tell Lee Freedman to get his horse to have a real good look at my bloke's 
head on the training track, because once they're in a race, all he ever sees of 
my bloke is his backside." 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath the laid-back humor and unorthodox training methods, though, was a 
real success story. Rail's first and only big winner earned $3.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Leg injuries eventually brought Rail's express to a halt. Vo Rogue was retired 
at the end of 1991, and apart from the odd minor success, that was the last the 
sporting public heard of Rail. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final months of his life, Rail was facing problems on at least two 
fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 A troubled personal life had led to an apparent addiction to sleeping pills, 
with friends quoted as saying he was taking as many as 12-14 daily. 
</P>
<P>
 And there were suggestions that pills prescribed to other personnel in his 
stable were being consumed by Rail. 
</P>
<P>
 As this dosage took its toll, it appears that hygiene at the stable began to 
suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Rats infested the stable complex that Vo Rogue's winnings had helped to buy in 
the Brisbane suburb of Hendren. 
</P>
<P>
 "As big as small cats," according to local residents, the rats could lift 
drainage grates and enjoyed the run of the stables. 
</P>
<P>
 The first horse to die, a broodmare, fell ill on Sept. 9 and had to be 
destroyed. Two days later, Quegent, the best horse in Rail's stable, a winner 
in Melbourne, also fell ill. 
</P>
<P>
 And Rail himself was sick with a high temperature, uncontrollable tremors and 
difficulty breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight days later, nine more horses had become stricken. Their trainer had been 
sent to bed. 
</P>
<P>
 By Sept. 20, Rail had been admitted to a hospital. Two days later, seven of 
his horses had died along with another from a neighboring stable. 
</P>
<P>
 Racing and government authorities were notified, and a three-mile exclusion 
zone was declared around the stables, prohibiting the movement of horses in or 
out of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Also falling within the quarantined area were Brisbane's two racetracks, 
Doomben and Eagle Farm. 
</P>
<P>
 That same day, the weekend's racing in southeast Queensland was canceled. The 
cancellation was later extended to last weekend, and included a race meeting in 
northern New South Wales, south of the Queensland border. 
</P>
<P>
 Rail was treated for Legionnaire's disease while in the hospital but tests 
before and after his death were inconclusive and the cause of his death has not 
been determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Tissue samples from his liver, as well as from the horses and rats, have been 
tested at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization's 
animal health laboratory near Melbourne, at that city's Fairfield infectious 
diseases hospital, and at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists at each have reportedly said they have no idea what caused the 
deaths.

CSUN WEIGHING BEAUREGARD CASE; COLLEGES: SPOKESMAN SAYS SHOOTING INCIDENT STILL 
'UNDER ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON and STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge on Monday took no immediate action against a football 
player charged with attempted murder in the shooting of two outside a San 
Bernardino bar in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Beauregard, 22, of San Bernardino, was arrested by police on Aug. 29, 
a few hours after a shooting incident at the Arrowhead Elks' bar, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge coaches and administrators said they had no knowledge of the 
incident, which occurred on the first day of school, until last weekend.  
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard, a senior and two-year starter at offensive right guard for the 
Matadors, was taken into custody near his mother's home in San Bernardino, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were identified as Dunyella Darshell Smith, described by 
authorities as Beauregard's ex-girlfriend, and Von E. Thompson, a security 
guard who was sitting in his truck with Smith at the time of the incident, 
authorities said. Smith was shot once in the hip as she tried to flee. Thompson 
was hit once in the arm, and a second shot aimed at his chest was stopped by a 
bulletproof vest, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard has not been suspended from the team. School spokesman Barry Smith 
said Monday that school administrators had not confirmed with police that he 
had been arrested, adding that the incident was still "under administrative 
review." 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Kopita, vice president for student affairs, said university officials 
will closely watch the case as it proceeds through the courts, but that it 
could be a violation of Beauregard's civil rights to take action against him 
based only on an accusation, not a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling is still that he's been accused and hasn't had his day in court," 
Athletic Director Bob Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopita added however that there are standards of "expected behavior" for 
athletes representing the university, and said he plans to discuss the issue 
with Bob Burt, the Matadors' coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the teams have codes of behavior and I suspect there will be discussion 
within the football team regarding this individual," Kopita said, never 
mentioning Beauregard by name. "The team may decide as a group what should take 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert said a meeting with Northridge administrators has been scheduled 
Wednesday to discuss the matter.  
</P>
<P>
 If Beauregard chooses to remain on the squad, the school could be forced to 
decide whether he can stay, Hiegert said, adding: "I don't know what we'd do 
then." 
</P>
<P>
 Burt told the team about the arrest before practice Monday. Most of the 
players were unaware of the incident, and Burt described himself as in shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy has been a stand-up member of the program," Burt said, his voice 
cracking. "He's done all the right things. He was a good student and he was 
well-liked. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has taken us all back a step. We don't know him in this way at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore defensive back James Woods was one of several players who hadn't 
heard the news about Beauregard until Monday's team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was disbelief," Woods said. "Coach Burt sat us down and said he and Beau 
and the family were going to handle it, and for us to try to move ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard was originally booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, 
but when charges were filed against him on Sept. 2, they included two special 
circumstances -- using a handgun and inflicting great bodily injury -- which 
could add eight years to any prison sentence imposed, said San Bernardino 
County Deputy District Atty. Denise Trager.  
</P>
<P>
 Court documents also contained a notation that read, "ex-girlfriend has been 
victim of (2) assaults by him in past." There were no descriptions of either 
alleged incident. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said Beauregard asked for and was given permission to skip 
practice Monday "to attend to personal matters." 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago this week, Beauregard walked off a team bus as it left campus for a 
game against Las Vegas. In a highly charged moment, Beauregard decided to join 
a teammate and a group of students picketing to protest what they said was the 
school's insufficient financial support for athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Beauregard changed his mind later that day and flew to Las Vegas at 
his own expense to rejoin the team. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game against Southwest Texas State last month, Beauregard was penalized 
for a personal foul, reacted angrily and complained vehemently to officials.  
</P>
<P>
 After he was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct, Beauregard hurled his 
helmet to the ground, was given another penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct and 
thrown out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Replacing Beauregard after the ejection was reserve lineman Eric Thomas, who 
as a bystander was shot in the back during a holdup at a fast-food outlet in 
South-Central Los Angeles on July 14, 1989. Should Beauregard leave the team, 
Thomas would be his likely replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard, who was senior class president at San Bernardino's Cajon High in 
1989-90, started all four games at right guard for the Matadors this season.

DODGERS UNLOAD THREE VETERANS; BASEBALL: GOTT, MCDOWELL, SNYDER TURNED LOOSE TO 
CLEAR WAY FOR FOUR TRIPLE-A PLAYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In three moves that were not unexpected, the Dodgers put Jim Gott, Roger 
McDowell and Cory Snyder on a designated-for-assignment list, signaling the end 
of their careers with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Claire, executive vice president, said he made the moves to clear space 
on the 40-man roster for four players from triple-A Albuquerque whom he 
believes deserve a chance to make the team. They are left-handed reliever Al 
Osuna, catcher Tom Prince and outfielders Jerry Brooks and Reggie Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers put all three veteran players on outright waivers when they 
designated them for assignment. But it is almost certain that none of them will 
accept an assignment to the minors, which is not the Dodgers' intention anyway. 
The players will be able to declare free agency when the waivers clear on 
Thursday, enabling the Dodgers to renegotiate with them if the club so chooses. 
Had the club released the players, it would not have been allowed to re-sign 
them until May 15. 
</P>
<P>
 But it seems clear that the Dodgers are more interested in younger players 
from the farm system, especially pitchers. The club is high on triple-A 
relievers Greg Hansell, Antonio Osuna and Todd Williams, and has a renewed 
interest in Al Osuna, who pitched well after being sent down last season. 
</P>
<P>
 For Gott, 35, McDowell, 33, and Snyder, 31, their final season with the 
Dodgers was fraught with frustration. Gott, who saved 25 games for the team in 
1993, struggled through '94, even undergoing a mid-season appendectomy. With 
Todd Worrell back as the closer, Gott returned to the setup role, but could not 
get near the form he'd had. He ended the strike-shortened season with a 5-3 
record, two saves and a 5.94 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 McDowell, who was with the team 2 1/2 seasons, was used sparingly by Manager 
Tom Lasorda. He pitched 41 1/3 innings in 32 games, by far the fewest innings 
he had pitched in 10 seasons, and he had his worst season. He ended with an 0-3 
record and a 5.23 ERA. His option for 1995 of $1.5 million was bought out by 
the Dodgers for $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder, 31, got off to a poor start because of injuries all spring, and never 
quite equaled his success of his first season of 1993, when he took over for 
Darryl Strawberry in right field and played in 143 games. He was platooned with 
Henry Rodriguez in left field, starting against left-handers, and played in 
only 73 games. He finished the season with a .235 batting average, six home 
runs, six doubles and 18 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder was valuable to the team because he could play virtually any position, 
but the emergence of minor league left fielder Billy Ashley appears to have 
made Snyder expendable. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers also have seven potential free agents to deal with, among them 
Orel Hershiser and Kevin Gross. 
</P>
<P>

 In another development, major league scout Art Howe received permission from 
Fred Claire to interview for the Colorado Rockies' job as hitting instructor.

THE PAIN IN WAYNE; THE MORE UCLA'S COOK GETS HIT THE MORE HE SEEMS TO STRUGGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wayne Cook is like the tightrope walker who can't look down. He doesn't want 
to know if somebody has cut the net. 
</P>
<P>
 You can see it in his game. Passes that used to be on target are off, because 
they are delivered before the target is open and, besides, it's a different 
target. It's smaller, for one thing. It isn't J.J. Stokes. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are other targets, and he's missing some of them, throwing the ball 
into the ground or eight yards deep when the receiver has run nine or 10. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the game of a quarterback fighting a loss of confidence, in himself and 
his teammates. It's not the game of a senior quarterback who spent his junior 
season leading UCLA to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been watching films and you can see that (in Saturday's 37-10 loss to 
Washington) he thought he didn't have the protection, but he did," offensive 
coordinator Bob Toledo said. "He's been hit so many times that it's tough to 
stay in the pocket and step forward and throw the ball, so he's stepping away 
(from the pass rush) and throwing across his body. He's completing some of 
those passes, but it's a lot harder." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem arose in the Washington State game two weeks ago, when Cook was 
sacked seven times, hit hard on most of his 25 passes and forced to scramble 
often. 
</P>
<P>
 "This week (against Washington) I saw myself stepping away or not stepping 
into the throw or moving around in the pocket," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm even stepping up in the pocket too far sometimes and taking some hits I 
don't need to." 
</P>
<P>
 Never particularly mobile, he also finds himself throwing on the run when he 
could stop and find a receiver. It's not Cook's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are times that Wayne is not getting set, is too herky-jerky, too 
unsettled and is too skitterish," Coach Terry Donahue said. "Some of the 
reasons for that are: No. 1, he is trying to get used to a new offensive line, 
and a line that, the week before, didn't get him protected. 
</P>
<P>
 "No. 2, at times his running backs aren't doing a good job of getting him 
protected. 
</P>
<P>
 "And No. 3, his receivers at times are not doing a good job of getting open. 
So there are reasons why Wayne may be lacking some confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 It's an offensive line that had three new starters as the season began. All 
three have been injured, and a second shift of new starters is in place. 
</P>
<P>
 The line was a sieve against Washington State, but better against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "They played a great game," Cook said. "Now, hopefully, I can come back and 
get my confidence back and believe that I can stay in the pocket and they're 
going to protect me forever." 
</P>
<P>
 The backs are all tailbacks -- some converted to fullbacks -- who are better 
suited to running than putting their heads into a linebacker's chest. And the 
receivers, without the injured Stokes, have struggled, except for Kevin Jordan, 
who has 35 catches for 541 yards and three touchdowns in five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Mike Nguyen among the dozen others who have caught passes this season has 
more than 100 yards, and he has only 101. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Cook) may be pushing the ball a little, instead of just ripping it," Donahue 
said. "It might be because of interceptions, shyness. It might be that he's not 
sure of the move his receiver is going to make. Where he has a feeling with 
Jordan and he had a feeling with Stokes, now he's getting used to (slot 
receiver) Derek Ayers and Bryan Adams playing at split end." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook has thrown five interceptions, one more than all of last season, which 
could be the reason for passes thrown in the dirt or making receivers cut 
patterns short. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of times at the beginning of the game, I found myself aiming the 
ball . . . " Cook said. "It can happen. On one play, I threw it out to the left 
and I threw it short because I knew the corner was playing closer than usual. I 
was trying not to make a mistake, but sometimes that can backfire on you. That 
was one of my goals in the game, not to throw an interception. And I didn't. I 
didn't even come close. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have to try to find myself a happy medium: not throw the picks, 
but be bold enough to do what I did before and use my ability." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Toledo: "Maybe he's playing a bit tighter now." 
</P>
<P>
 He's not the only one. For UCLA to win, Cook has to play well, but so do 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three guys who have to function for us to be a good offensive team are J.J. 
Stokes, Wayne Cook and (kicker) Bjorn Merten," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes was injured on the second play of the season, against Tennessee, and 
has played sporadically. Coming off an All-American freshman season, Merten has 
missed six of his last eight field goal tries, making one of four against 
Washington after missing one in each of the previous two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook started strong in victories over Tennessee and Southern Methodist, threw 
for 217 yards -- but with two interceptions -- against Nebraska and was 
hammered by Washington State. Against Washington, he completed 14 of 30 passes 
for 194 yards, but missed some open receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not that simple. 
</P>
<P>
 On Cook's first pass, he overthrew an open Nguyen on the Washington 11. Later, 
his pass hit Ayers in the chest, but Ayers dropped the ball. Later still, 
Cook's protection broke down and he threw on the run, incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, I don't believe when you have that kind of evidence in front of you that 
you say, 'Let's can this guy and get another one,' " Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the easy answer in the NFL, but a tougher one in college football. You 
can't go out and sign a free-agent sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly think that Wayne Cook is the best quarterback we have in the 
program right now," Donahue said. "I think he is the most equipped to get our 
team turned around right now, and I just think it's a fact of life that when a 
team is not going well that the focus becomes the head coach and the focus 
becomes the coordinator and the focus becomes the quarterback. It's just the 
way life is in football." 
</P>
<P>
 It is, when you have lost three games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wayne is like our team in general right now," Donahue said. "We're not 
functioning as efficiently or as well as we want to be, and Wayne is part of 
the problem. And I hope he's part of the solution. I think he can be." 
</P>
<P>
 As the quarterback at UCLA, he has to be. Different Directions

 First-year student and would-be kicker Sue Mercer failed in her bid to become 
the first female to make an NCAA Division I football team, Duke Coach Fred 
Goldsmith said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 She will be offered a spot as a special teams manager, Goldsmith said. 
</P>

 "She's not where she needs to be to kick at this level of football," Goldsmith 
said. "The leg strength wasn't there."

 Florida starting defensive tackle Henry McMillian will sit out for up to six 
weeks because of a torn left knee ligament suffered during Saturday's 38-14 
victory over Mississippi, team officials said. . . . Texas quarterback Shea 
Morenz said he hopes to play against Oklahoma this week after suffering 
strained knee ligaments against Colorado. Texas Coach John Mackovic called 
Morenz questionable for Saturday's game. Mackovic said redshirt freshman James 
Brown will get most of the snaps in practice this week. . . . Pittsburgh senior 
Curtis Martin, who rushed for 1,132 yards last season, will remain sidelined 
indefinitely because of an ankle injury and might be redshirted. Martin rushed 
for 251 yards in Pitt's season-opening 30-28 loss to Texas, but suffered a 
badly sprained left ankle a week later while blocking against Ohio University 
and hasn't played since.

KIM TAKES HIS GAME TO TENNIS ACADEMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 H. Andrew Kim owns a manufacturing company in Los Angeles, so he's used to 
making difficult business decisions. But none were as agonizing as the one he 
made last month to send his 16-year-old son, Kevin Kim, to Palmer Tennis 
Academy in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough," said Andrew Kim, also a commissioner for the state athletic 
commission. "I taught him the game. I know how to motivate him. But he's at an 
age where I have to let him go and do his own thing. I can't keep him. It was 
tough." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't only tough, it was expensive. A year's worth of tuition and living 
expenses at Palmer costs $32,000. A year at Sunny Hills High, where Kevin Kim 
would have been a junior, costs nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I found out what it costs, I was virtually flabbergasted," Andrew Kim 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim had planned on a sponsor paying his son's way to Palmer, but the sponsor 
backed out at the last minute and left him holding the bill. The semester had 
already begun at Palmer and Kim had only a few days to make his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hardest for my wife," Andrew Kim said. "Her life revolves around 
Kevin. We thought he'd stay here and graduate from Sunny Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "This goes against everything that is important to our (Korean) culture, 
families staying together. But our position is, we wanted him to get an 
education, and Palmer has a great reputation as an academy." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Kim, the nation's top-ranked player in the boys' 16 division, said he 
began considering Palmer this summer after his first-round loss in the U.S. 
Open junior tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "That woke me up," Kim said Monday from his apartment in Tampa, Fla. "I 
thought about all these players out there, and that I'm not the greatest 
player, that I need improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim said he didn't believe improvement would come as quickly in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eric Lin is in college (at UCLA) and (top-ranked junior) Geoff Abrams is in 
Newport Beach, so there's not a lot to play with," Kim said. "Here, I know what 
I'm doing everyday, play tennis and go to school. It's not bad really, it's 
what I need now." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Kim said, it's not easy leaving home at 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your personal life is not high up there," he said. "It's tough. I still keep 
in touch with my friends. I thought about this for a long time, until the day 
before I left. All of sudden I'm washing my own clothes and I'm eating somebody 
else's cooking. It's not as good as my mom's." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Kim said, his tennis appetite is being fed. He has played 
Daniel Nestor, ranked No. 170 in the world, twice in the last week and he is 
practicing about four hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sam Olson, who has coached Kim the last three years, doesn't necessarily 
think a tennis academy will be the best thing for Kim's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing for Kevin is individual training, not group training," Olson 
said. "That's what you get in those academies. I've also heard that Kevin's the 
best junior there, and that's not going to help him." 
</P>
<P>
 Olson believes Kim's tennis career would be better served if he tried playing 
the professional circuit for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's ready," said Olson, who runs a tennis academy at the Balboa Bay 
Racquet Club. "In tennis, unless you get used to playing at a certain level, 
you will never be able to play at that level. After two years on the tour, he'd 
be at that level. After two years at the academy, where will he be?" 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Kim isn't sure, but he would prefer that his son finish high school. 
Kim's stance is similar to that of Richard Williams, father of 14-year-old 
tennis phenom Venus Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams thinks his daughter is too young to play professional tennis, but he 
has decided to respect his daughter's wishes and allow her to join the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin is too mature for me to stand in his way, but I will advise him to 
finish school," Andrew Kim said. "It's been my teaching to him to get an 
education, because money is not that important in life. I think he'll stand by 
my teaching." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Kim is leaving his options open. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, I'll be here for two years," he said. "It depends on how good I 
get." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills Coach Steve White was hoping to have Kim on his team this year, 
but he wasn't shocked by Kim's departure. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's really important to Kevin is tennis, it's not the prom or the typical 
things kids his age are into," said White, who has won two consecutive Southern 
Section titles with Kim playing No. 1 singles.

MATADORS TO WAIT AND SEE IN SHOOTINGS CASE; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: LINEMAN 
BEAUREGARD, ACCUSED OF WOUNDING TWO, MIGHT NOT BE DISCIPLINED, OFFICIAL SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON and STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Cal State Northridge administrator said Monday the school might not take 
action against a football player charged with attempted murder in the shooting 
of two outside a San Bernardino bar in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Beauregard, 22, of San Bernardino, was arrested on Aug. 29 a few 
hours after a shooting at the Arrowhead Elks' bar, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard, a senior and two-year starter at offensive right guard for the 
Matadors, was taken into custody near his mother's home in San Bernardino, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were identified as Dunyella Darshell Smith, described by 
authorities as Beauregard's former girlfriend, and Von E. Thompson, a security 
guard who was sitting in his truck with Smith at the time of the incident, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was shot once in the hip as she tried to flee. Thompson was hit once in 
the arm, and a second shot aimed at his chest was stopped by a bullet-proof 
vest, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard has not been suspended from the team. School spokesman Barry Smith 
said Monday that school administrators had not confirmed with police that 
Beauregard had been arrested, adding that the incident was still "under 
administrative review." 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Kopita, vice president for student affairs, said that it could be a 
violation of Beauregard's civil rights to take action against him based only on 
an accusation, not a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling is still that he's been accused and hasn't had his day in court," 
Athletic Director Bob Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopita added that there are standards of "expected behavior" for athletes 
representing the university, and said he expected to discuss the issue with Bob 
Burt, the Matadors' head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the teams have codes of behavior and I suspect there will be discussion 
within the football team regarding this individual," Kopita said, never 
mentioning Beauregard by name. "The team may decide as a group what should take 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert said a meeting with Northridge administrators has been scheduled 
Wednesday to discuss the matter. If Beauregard chooses to remain on the squad, 
the school might be forced to decide whether he can stay, Hiegert said, adding: 
"I don't know what we'd do then." 
</P>
<P>
 Burt told the team about the arrest before practice Monday. Most of the 
players were unaware of the incident, he said, although he described himself as 
in shock. "The guy has been a stand-up member of the program," Burt said, his 
voice cracking. "He's done all the right things. He was a good student and he 
was well-liked. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has taken us all back a step. We don't know him in this way at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore defensive back James Woods was one of several players who hadn't 
heard the news about Beauregard until Burt held a brief meeting before practice 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was disbelief," Woods said. "Coach Burt sat us down and said he and Beau 
and the family were going to handle it, and for us to try to move ahead."

 Beauregard was originally booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, 
but when charges were filed against him on Sept. 2, they included two special 
circumstances -- using a handgun and inflicting great bodily injury -- which 
could add eight years to any prison sentence imposed, said San Bernardino 
County Deputy District Atty. Denise Trager.  
</P>
<P>
 Court documents also contained a notation that read, "ex-girlfriend has been 
victim of (2) assaults by him in past." There were no descriptions of either 
alleged incident. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said Beauregard asked for and was given permission to skip 
practice Monday "to attend to personal matters." 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard, senior class president at San Bernardino's Cajon High in 1989-90, 
started all four games for the Matadors this season.

KNOX PLANS TO START MILLER AT GREEN BAY; PRO FOOTBALL: NO. 1 QUARTERBACK STILL 
NOT 100%, BUT CHANDLER IS OUT AND HE GETS NOD OVER MADDOX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Quarterback Chris Miller said Monday that his injured right shoulder still 
isn't 100%, but that apparently won't stop Ram Coach Chuck Knox from starting 
him over a sound Tommy Maddox at Green Bay on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox normally doesn't announce personnel decisions on Mondays, but with 
starter Chris Chandler sidelined for the rest of the week because of a sprained 
left ankle, he said he plans to turn the offense over to Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what it looks like, although we don't make those decisions at this 
point," Knox said. "But if he's well enough along, he will start." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has sat out the last two games because of sore ribs, a pinched nerve in 
his shoulder, and, as he revealed for the first time, a slightly separated 
right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 So is Knox saying that an injured Miller is better than an inexperienced 
Maddox, who was shaky in his Ram debut Sunday, an 8-5 loss to Atlanta at 
Anaheim Stadium? 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't say that," Knox said. "What I'm saying is that we expect Chris 
Miller to be 100% this week and certainly he knows our system and has been 
through training camp. That's what I'm saying." 
</P>
<P>
 So Knox will start Miller, leaving Maddox as the backup. Meanwhile, the Rams 
are trying to re-sign Jamie Martin, whom they cut in August, as the emergency 
quarterback. Martin is expected to be at Rams Park today to meet with team 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox described Maddox, 23, as the Rams' "quarterback of the future" when the 
team traded a fourth-round draft pick to Denver for him in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddox got little work in practice last week, splitting the backup snaps with 
Miller. When called upon to replace the injured Chandler in the second quarter 
Sunday, Maddox struggled, completing only seven of 15 passes for 86 yards with 
no touchdowns and two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's in a learning process," Knox said. "Every snap is new for him. Tommy 
didn't get the reps in practice last week, and he was placed in a tough 
situation Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 Maddox's ineffectiveness forced Knox to push Miller to the forefront this 
week. Miller lifted weights Monday and said his shoulder is getting stronger, 
but he said his ability to throw deep "is a concern." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to go," said Miller, who has completed 24 of 55 passes for 404 
yards with two touchdowns and four interceptions this season. "(The shoulder) 
is not 100% right now, but with Chris Chandler banged up, I have to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he suffered the separated shoulder when San Francisco's Dana 
Stubblefield sacked him three weeks ago. He said he is regaining strength 
slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a slight separation," Knox said. "It's painful when you throw, but you 
can still play with it, as long as you have the arm strength." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller had warmed up on the sidelines in the second half Sunday after being 
given a shot in his shoulder at halftime. But he and Knox were reluctant to 
have him play on the Rams' final drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had talked earlier if he would be available in the second half," Knox 
said. "But you're rolling the dice when you have a quarterback who's not 100%." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Ram coaches gave Miller another reason for holding him out on the 
final drive: If Miller, the emergency quarterback, would have entered the game, 
Maddox would not have been allowed to return. As a result, Maddox, the holder 
on field goals, could not have re-entered the game to hold if Tony Zendejas 
would have attempted a game-tying field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, who started the last two games, wore a walking cast on his injured 
ankle Monday and said doctors originally told him he would be sidelined at 
least two weeks. He said the ankle improved dramatically overnight and added 
that he might try to practice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to try it," said Chandler, who suffered the injury when Atlanta's 
Ron George tackled him from behind on a flea-flicker play in the second 
quarter. "I might be proven wrong on Wednesday, but we will wait and see how it 
feels."

NEW WAVE OF QUAKE REFUGEES SEEK SHELTER; HOUSING: OWNERS OF DAMAGED HOMES WHO 
ARE JUST NOW RECEIVING INSURANCE MONEY OR GOVERNMENT LOANS TAKE UP TEMPORARY 
LODGING IN HOTELS AND APARTMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After another long day at the office, David Ustin pulls up in front of the 
Warner Center Marriott Hotel, hands his keys to the valet and walks through the 
glass porte-cochere into the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Ustin is home -- at least, what has been his home for the past seven months. 
</P>
<P>
 Like hundreds of others whose homes were damaged by the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake, Ustin and his wife, Ethel, have had to find temporary lodging while 
repairing their quake-damaged Tarzana house. 
</P>
<P>
 They live without home-cooked meals, their cozy couch, their mementos from 53 
years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Living in a hotel for so long, you find out that you can live without a lot 
of things," said Ethel Ustin. "All you really need is a bed, bathroom and your 
clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 Although areas scattered around Los Angeles were hit hard by the quake, the 
greatest demand for temporary housing has been in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 And although Valley-area hotel and apartment managers say the biggest influx 
of temporary tenants arrived just after the quake, they are noticing the 
beginnings of another migration of homeowners who are only now receiving 
insurance money or Small Business Administration loans to repair their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman at Oakwood Apartments estimated that about 100 units at the 
1,151-unit complex in Toluca Lake and 125 units at the 883-unit facility in 
Woodland Hills are occupied by homeowners waiting for home repairs to be 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Oakwood at Westmoreland Avenue and 3rd Street in the Westlake district, 
about 20 units are occupied by homeless homeowners, and the Oakwood in West Los 
Angeles reported just a handful of quake-damage refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of the second wave of quake-repair refugees means a lot of people 
will be spending the holidays away from home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We moved in July when the work on our home was supposed to start, but the 
work still hasn't started," said Dorothy Stockdale, who with her husband, 
Raymond, has been living in the Toluca Lake Oakwood Apartments while their 
Hollywood Manor home is being repaired. "We've resigned ourselves to 
celebrating the holidays here." 
</P>
<P>
 This renewed demand for temporary housing is not expected to make a 
significant dent in the Valley's 12% rental vacancy rate, said Mary Ellen 
Hughes, executive director of the Apartment Assn. of San Fernando 
Valley/Ventura County. However, Hughes said that in the West Valley -- 
apparently the prime location for temporary housing -- the vacancy rate has 
dropped to about 8%. 
</P>
<P>
 For those with damaged houses, the decision whether to move into a hotel or 
apartment often depends on how much time a homeowner expects to be away and who 
is going to pay the bills. Those who anticipate shorter stays and who can 
depend on insurance money to pay for living expenses favor hotels; those who 
expect to be homeless for some time, have loans that will need to be repaid and 
have no reimbursements, opt for apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost is vastly different: Nice hotels run about $100 a night. Furnished 
apartments primarily marketed to business people and offering month-to-month 
leases run about $1,550 a month for a one-bedroom unit. If leases of less than 
a year can be found in unfurnished apartment complexes, the cost can be far 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever the choice, in each case homeowners used to their space and 
privacy have to adjust to having only a wall separating them from their 
neighbors and to sharing everything from laundry facilities to parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, however, homeowners interviewed said the transition has not been 
all that difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hard part in all this was making the decision where to move," said Vivian 
Boyer, who last month was forced to move out for at least six months while her 
143-unit Tarzana townhouse complex is being repaired. She and her husband, 
Martin, chose an apartment complex in Woodland Hills, where one-bedrooms begin 
at $850 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apartment living is OK, but I would not chose to do it on a permanent basis," 
Vivian Boyer said, adding that she misses her washer and dryer and hates having 
to park one car behind the other in the shared parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartment was unfurnished, so they moved in some of their furniture and 
put the rest in storage, a cost that they will have to pay themselves, adding 
to their financial hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance purchased by the Boyers' homeowners association is paying for 
repairs to their unit and the complex, but they are responsible for the first 
$16,000. They also did not have insurance coverage for living expenses, which 
will force them to dip into their savings. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Marty Rosenblatt's pets that made him immediately rule out a hotel for 
temporary accommodations. Instead he, his wife, his daughter, their dog and two 
cats moved into a two-bedroom apartment near their under-construction Woodland 
Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've managed so far, but it's not the same as our home," Rosenblatt said. 
"We are viewing this as a summer getaway." 
</P>
<P>
 At hotels, various accommodations are being made for the long-term guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Such guests at the Warner Center Hilton and Towers in Woodland Hills get a 
discount from the normal $129-a-night room rate, said General Manager Fred De 
Stefano, although he would not disclose the amount of the break. Quake-repair 
refugees have stayed as long as six months at the 318-room hotel . 
</P>
<P>
 The 461-room Warner Center Marriott in Woodland Hills hired a second guest 
relations manager to address the concerns of long-term guests, said Julie 
Reigle, marketing and sales director. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the hotel has been filling about 50 rooms a night with displaced 
homeowners, who stay one to three months.

SINKAGE REPORT CITES GROUTING PROBLEMS; SUBWAY: FIRST INDEPENDENT WRITTEN 
ANALYSIS OF HOLLYWOOD TUNNEL PROJECT DISAGREES WITH MTA OFFICIALS ON SEVERAL 
POINTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Inadequate tunneling procedures -- including the failure to grout properly -- 
contributed to sinkage along Hollywood Boulevard in August, according to an 
engineering analysis prepared for the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The analysis, the first written assessment of the structural problems by 
engineers not affiliated with the $3-billion subway project, will be presented 
today to the City Council. A copy of the document was obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Tunneling beneath Hollywood Boulevard has been shut down since Aug. 18, when 
surface sinkages of two to nine inches was confirmed along a nine-block area. 
Federal authorities are investigating, and the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority hired a consulting firm Friday to review the construction and related 
engineering decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the city report's findings run counter to explanations cited by 
high-ranking officials of the MTA and by engineers who oversee construction. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the analysis found that ruptures of water lines along Hollywood 
Boulevard in August "were the result of the ground settlement caused by the 
tunneling operations." Metro Rail engineers and the MTA's president of 
construction, Edward McSpedon, have said they were unsure whether the ruptures 
were caused by the tunneling or by pre-existing factors, such as the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The analysis prepared for the city blamed the sinkages on "time delays" in 
doing "contact grouting" from within the tunnel. Such grouting is supposed to 
be done within 16 hours of each advancement of the tunnel-boring machines. The 
Times reported Sept. 11 that MTA engineers for months did not require the 
tunneling contractor to do the grouting. 
</P>
<P>
 McSpedon, in a Sept. 16 letter to elected officials on the MTA board, said: 
"Project experience on Hollywood Boulevard and elsewhere has shown that contact 
grouting has had little significance in reducing surface settlements." McSpedon 
could not be reached for comment Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The city report also found that "several borings" of soil gathered before 
excavation signaled that the worst-affected area of Hollywood Boulevard 
contained "running sand conditions" that required special precautions. One soil 
study in 1990 "states that the running sand . . . may require remedial measures 
such as chemical grouting from the tunnel face." 
</P>
<P>
 Chemical grouting was not done during tunneling of the area hardest hit by 
sinkage, roughly from Vine Street to Highland Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 An MTA Tunnel Review Board report, prepared by the project's chief tunnel 
designer and distributed Sept. 1, blamed the sinkage in part on ground "which 
had an indetectable difference in soil consistency . . . compared to other 
locations along Hollywood Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's report, prepared over the past two weeks by private engineer Gerald 
D. Lehmer and signed by two city department heads, included other conclusions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Wood wedges, used as bracing instead of metal struts, fell far short of the 
strength required to hold the soil loads. "A substantial number of wood wedges 
have been crushed and displaced" in tunnels under the north and south sides of 
Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 * Contact grouting "must be carefully implemented in strict accordance with 
(project) specifications and warnings" contained in years-old geotechnical 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Greater reliance should be placed on the (soil) boring data and all 
geotechnical information in considering preventative measures while tunneling." 
</P>
<P>
 * Additional steel shoring should be installed in the tunnels. The shoring was 
first erected after the tunnel contractor evacuated workers Aug. 20, fearing 
that one of the tunnels was in danger of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Water is still seeping into the north-side tunnel, between Hudson and 
Whitley avenues.

THE FALL OF L.A.; A SUBTLE CHANGE IN THE SEASONS IS UNDER WAY AND IN THE AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The weatherman was hedging his bets but, yes, this just might be the week. It 
just might be autumn in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Drizzle due at the Downtown Civic Center. Cold front hovering to the north and 
west. Those signs, the weatherman allowed carefully, were indeed harbingers of 
fall -- meteorologically speaking, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 But you can't be too sure, he emphasized no less than three times. And it's 
true -- autumn here is an equivocal thing. This, after all, is the place that 
for decades promoted itself as a land without seasons, a city of perpetual blue 
skies. No wonder the East Coast has cornered the market on symbols of the 
equinox. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody notices whether there's frost on the pumpkins in the Halloween display 
at Ralphs. No one writes eloquent couplets about the leaf-blower's mighty buzz. 
So you have to find your own signs of fall -- in the number of days left till 
the El Cholo chain of Mexican restaurants stops serving green corn tamales; in 
the way the street vendors no longer cleave to the edge of the sidewalk in 
search of shade; in the crisp, amber quality the air suddenly acquires; in the 
way the Santa Anas demolish your lips. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, it has been autumn from coast to coast since Sept. 23, but only 
the most discerning Angeleno could have told you so without a calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the past 10 days have broken 85 degrees, and the signs of fall have, as 
usual, been in your more climate-controlled areas -- in the supermarkets where 
apples are on sale, a buck and a half for five pounds, and in the malls, where 
back-to-school mannequins are modeling plaid woolen skirts that make you 
scratchy just to look at them. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the past few days, reports have begun filtering in, from sources that 
are more elementally inclined. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources, for example, like Kevin Anderson, a 38-year-old Hermosa Beach 
surfboard salesman who's been surfing since he was 14 and who noticed the 
change "probably three or four days ago, when the first cold currents started 
coming in." 
</P>
<P>
 Autumn for Southern California surfers, Anderson said, begins with the first 
northerly swells, "and when you jump in, it's a real definite rush." 
</P>
<P>
 Late last week, Anderson said, the rush arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was around 60 (degrees), where before it had been 66 or 67," he said, "and 
you knew it was time for a spring suit where, before, you were barebackin' it." 
</P>
<P>
 Across town at the Huntington Gardens in San Marino, botanical director Jim 
Folsom also could have told you so: The chorisia were in bloom -- those tall 
trees with the big, pink blossoms -- and the begonias and impatiens "were 
starting to look beat up." 
</P>
<P>
 So for them, it's no surprise that, this weekend, people didn't feel like 
firing up the barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 Or that, according to meteorologist Kris Farnsworth of WeatherData, Inc., an 
upper level low-pressure system is hovering over Nevada, creating considerable 
cloudiness and low fog throughout much of the region. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, says Farnsworth, might be that pivotal, quintessentially 
Californian point between the fire season and the winter rains. 
</P>
<P>
 Or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to feel like autumn for this week at least," Farnsworth laughed. 
"To say more than that would be pushing it."

ITO TO RULE ON TV USE IN COURTROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD and GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angry at some media conduct, Judge Lance A. Ito on Monday scheduled a hearing 
on whether to yank a television camera from his courtroom once testimony begins 
in the O.J. Simpson double-murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 If Ito pulls the plug Nov. 7 on a Court TV pool camera, the action will 
destroy elaborate plans for live coverage of one of the most highly publicized 
murder trials in history. The possibility of such an action brought strong 
reaction from ABC, CBS, NBC and some local stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Some representatives of the broadcast media said their attorneys would be 
filing legal documents with Ito to dissuade him from terminating live coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 If Ito orders Court TV to remove its equipment from the courtroom, as he 
apparently has the discretion to do, it would eliminate the all-court network's 
plan for gavel-to-gavel coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 All other television news organizations would have instant access to the Court 
TV film under the current court-approved plan. The networks have planned a 
combination of live courtroom testimony, regular updates and evening wrap-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how the trial would be covered" if Ito bans the camera, said 
Carolyn Fox, executive director of the Radio and Television News Assn., a group 
that is coordinating broadcast coverage of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane Venardos, vice president of hard news and special events for CBS, said 
the public's desire for news about the case would not be satisfied without live 
TV coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are no pictures, then the whole trial becomes much more routine -- 
it's just another court case," he said. "There would be no live reports, no 
specials at night. . . . The coverage would be much more routine." 
</P>
<P>
 Said David Bohrman, NBC's executive producer of special events: "This may seem 
like a natural way to somehow compensate for some of the bad reporting, but the 
camera in the courtroom is not the problem. It will be far better if we have 
access." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox said broadcast organizations already have sunk $1 million into "Camp 
O.J.," an electronic village of equipment-filled trailers and towering 
platforms in a rented parking lot across the street from the Criminal Courts 
Building. Stations and networks have plunked down $7,000 each for space in a 
courthouse pressroom that was specially built for the Simpson trial, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Brill, president of Court TV, said he thinks Ito can be persuaded not 
to pull the camera. But, Brill said, "If it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Some industry insiders speculated that the networks, local stations and 
advertisers might actually be pleased if Ito pulls the plug. They said some 
advertisers do not want their commercials to air during the trial and will be 
delighted if live TV coverage is banned. And the networks would not have to 
lose millions of dollars from the cancellation of soap operas. 
</P>
<P>
 The gavel-to-gavel broadcast of the Simpson preliminary hearing by ABC, CBS 
and NBC cost the networks an estimated $1 million each in lost advertising 
revenue and alienated many soap opera fans. But the networks' daytime ratings 
significantly increased. 
</P>
<P>
 Besty Frank, senior vice president of New York-based Saatchi & Saatchi 
Advertising, said, "I'm sure there are advertisers who don't want to be a part 
of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito first threatened to schedule the hearing on the camera ban last month 
after Los Angeles station KNBC Channel 4 twice aired what it later acknowledged 
were false reports about the testing of blood found on socks at Simpson's home. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the judge failed to set a date for the hearing on the day he said he 
would, many journalists covering the trial thought the matter had blown over. 
</P>
<P>
 Notice that the controversy was still alive arrived Monday in the form of a 
one-page document from Ito to media attorneys and Brill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court proposes to terminate film and electronic coverage," the notice 
reads, then cites the KNBC gaffe and incidents last week in which, contrary to 
court rules, some television stations aired film showing the faces of jurors in 
cases other than Simpson's. 
</P>
<P>
 In retaliation for that, Ito ordered removal of a camera set up outside his 
courtroom. He also stopped still photographers from taking pictures in the 
corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Monday, Ito acknowledged that the incidents involving the 
filming of jurors heightened his concern about TV coverage, but he added that 
he always intended to resolve the matter of the courtroom camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "People kept saying, 'When are you going to do it?' so I thought it was time," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge set the hearing date more than a month from now, he said, because 
there is no reason to hold it immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in jury selection, and there's no point in doing it now," Ito said, 
noting that cameras are banned from the courtroom anyway during the jury 
selection proceedings, which are expected to last through October. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides, I have 304 (jury) questionnaires to read," the judge added, 
referring to the 79 pages of questions each of the 304 prospective jurors 
filled out last week. Media coverage of the Simpson case has troubled 
authorities from the day the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson, the football 
great's ex-wife, and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman were found outside her 
condominium in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers have blamed the Los Angeles Police Department for 
selectively releasing information -- some of it inaccurate -- to taint 
potential jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Monday, the defense filed a motion under seal asking for a hearing to 
determine the "source and purpose" of leaks to the media. Ito agreed to 
consider that motion Wednesday, when a hearing on other issues is scheduled. 
The motion, according to sources, asks Ito to probe police and members of the 
prosecution team to determine if any are responsible for certain news reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson has pleaded not guilty to the murders, but the news coverage of the 
case, both print and broadcast, has been awash in speculation about his 
involvement. There have been reports based on news leaks -- many of them false 
-- about evidence connecting him to the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito is allowed to bar cameras from his courtroom if their presence threatens 
the dignity and orderly proceedings of the court or Simpson's right to a fair 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Brill and others, Royal Oakes, a lawyer who represents the Radio 
and Television News Assn., has argued to Ito that banning the in-court camera 
is an improper remedy for the matters that concern the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not the live coverage of the many pretrial hearings that is alleged to 
have interfered with the rights of the parties," Oakes wrote in a letter he 
sent to Ito after the KNBC incidents. Instead, the letter said, "it is a 
phenomenon totally unrelated to the presence of cameras in the courtroom, 
namely, alleged leaks of falsehoods." 
</P>
<P>
 Without the in-court camera, there would be more incentive for reporters to 
seek information from other, perhaps unreliable sources, the letter argues. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakes said Monday that Ito, if he bans the camera, will also be denying 
appropriate access to the trial since seating in the courtroom for the press 
and public is limited. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development Monday, Nicole Brown Simpson's will and any documents 
related to it were sealed at the request of her father. 
</P>
<P>
 Papers filed by Louis H. Brown, however, disclose that his daughter was worth 
an estimated $700,000 when she died. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of her assets are intended to go to relatives, the paper said, and the 
remainder into a trust for her two young children. The will was dated May 4, 
five weeks before she was killed.

GREEN CARD GREEN LIGHT SWAMPS INS; RESIDENCY: NEW LAW LETS SOME AVOID FILING 
FOR PAPERS AT U.S. CONSULATES ABROAD. BUT MANY PEOPLE TURN OUT EVEN THOUGH THEY 
ARE NOT ELIGIBLE. 
</P>

 Joe Cho staked out his place in line at 10 p.m. Sunday and finally emerged 
late Monday morning with his prize -- appointments next year and a bill for 
$650. And the native of Korea was among the lucky ones. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,000 people beat a path Monday to the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service's headquarters in Downtown Los Angeles, many only to 
have their hopes dashed and questions left unanswered after lengthy waits. The 
overwhelmed agency, struggling to keep up with demand, turned away hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
 Confusion and disappointment seemed to be the norm on the first working day of 
a new law that allows eligible illegal immigrants to receive their green cards 
in the United States -- after paying a stiff $650 levy, the agency's highest 
penalty. The statute allows those already qualified because of family sponsors 
or job guarantees to avoid filing at U.S. consulates abroad, long a costly 
requirement for visa-seekers in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law became effective Saturday, but Monday was the first workday with 
the statute in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of the change has fed widespread rumors of a new "amnesty," raising false 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there are no new immigrant slots, just a different paperwork 
procedure for those notified of their eligibility for permanent resident 
status. Most prospective beneficiaries have already waited for years -- some 
for a decade or more -- following the filing of petitions by close relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in the immigrant hub of Southern California, expatriates quickly seize 
upon any prospect, however tenuous, that might liberate them or loved ones from 
their quasi-shadow existence and the onerous "illegal alien" label. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many families are divided," complained Jesus Vidal Carrillo, a 27-year-old 
truck driver and legal U.S. resident from Mexico who was among those in line 
Monday. "It's not fair," added Carrillo, who is sponsoring his wife for a green 
card. 
</P>
<P>
 Many braved the always-daunting INS lines even though neither they or their 
loved ones seem to qualify. Some voiced hopes that simply being on the lengthy 
visa waiting lists might be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is eligible? That's what we want to know," said an exasperated Thai woman 
who gave her name only as Tanya and explained that she was eager to help obtain 
a green card for her sister, a five-year veteran of the family waiting list. 
"The INS uses technical terms that we don't understand," Tanya complained as 
she waited. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials say they are trying to clear up the confusion, providing 
clarifying press interviews and preparing a checklist designed to assist the 
many confused. "I think some of those folks (in line) didn't want to recognize 
the fact that they're not eligible," said Christopher Fowler, INS assistant 
district director. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new law, as many as 100,000 people nationwide are expected to 
qualify each year to complete green card paperwork in the United States instead 
of going abroad. Half may live in Southern California, the INS says. Yet there 
are no immediate plans to bolster staff. Many fear that already substantial 
backlogs for a range of INS programs will bulge further. 
</P>
<P>
 The law was meant not as a convenience for illegal immigrants, but rather as a 
means of alleviating pressures on overseas consular offices and producing 
revenues for the financially ailing INS. 
</P>
<P>
 Expecting a crush of green card seekers, the INS assigned red-jacketed 
staffers Monday to work the polyglot queues on Los Angeles Street. Once inside, 
immigrants were given numbers and told to wait again, often for several hours, 
before they could advance to an information window. By about 10 a.m., the day's 
allotment of numbers had run out and INS workers were telling new arrivals to 
come back on another day. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Cho, the Korean store hand, benefited from the counsel of an attorney 
well-versed in the arcane intricacies of immigration law. Cho arrived ready 
with completed forms, check and other needed paperwork.  
</P>
<P>
 "This saves me lots of time and money," said Cho, husband of a permanent U.S. 
resident. Under previous law, he would have been obliged to travel to Seoul and 
take care of matters. 
</P>
<P>
 But any thoughts of completing everything in a single visit were soon 
thwarted. Cho was told to come back for interviews in January and February.

NEW WAVE OF QUAKE REFUGEES HITTING HOTELS, APARTMENTS; RECOVERY: SOME 
HOMEOWNERS ARE ONLY NOW RECEIVING INSURANCE MONEY OR GOVERNMENT LOANS FOR 
REPAIRS. MANY FIND TRANSITION TO TEMPORARY QUARTERS FAIRLY EASY.

 After another long day at the office, David Ustin pulls up in front of the 
Warner Center Marriott Hotel, hands his keys to the valet, and walks through 
the glass porte-cochere into the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Ustin is home -- at least, what has been his home for the past seven months. 
</P>
<P>
 Like hundreds of other homeowners with homes damaged by the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake, Ustin and his wife, Ethel, have had to find temporary lodging while 
repairing their quake-damaged Tarzana house. 
</P>
<P>
 They live without home-cooked meals, their cozy couch, their mementos from 53 
years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Living in a hotel for so long, you find out that you can live without a lot 
of things," said Ethel Ustin. "All you really need is a bed, bathroom and your 
clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 Although areas scattered around Los Angeles were hit hard by the quake, the 
greatest demand for temporary housing has been in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 And although Valley-area hotel and apartment managers say the biggest influx 
of temporary tenants arrived just after the quake, they are noticing the 
beginnings of another migration of homeowners who are only now receiving 
insurance money or Small Business Administration loans to repair their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman at the corporate-oriented Oakwood Apartments, for instance, 
estimated that about 100 units in the 1,151-unit complex in Toluca Lake and 125 
units in the 883-unit facility in Woodland Hills are occupied by homeowners 
waiting for home repairs to be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, over the hill the Oakwood at Westmoreland and Third has only 
about 20 units occupied by displaced homeowners and the Oakwood in West Los 
Angeles reported just a handful of quake-damage refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of the second wave of quake-repair refugees means a lot of people 
will be spending the holidays away from home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We moved in July when the work on our home was supposed to start, but the 
work still hasn't started," said Dorothy Stockdale, who with her husband, 
Raymond, has been living in the Toluca Lake Oakwood Apartments while their 
Hollywood Manor home is repaired. "We've resigned ourselves to celebrating the 
holidays here." 
</P>
<P>
 This renewed demand for temporary housing is not expected to make a 
significant dent in the Valley's 12% rental vacancy rate, according to Mary 
Ellen Hughes, executive director of the Apartment Assn. of San Fernando Valley 
/ Ventura County. However, Hughes said that in the West Valley the vacancy rate 
has dropped to about 8%. 
</P>
<P>
 For those with damaged houses, the decision of whether to move into a hotel or 
apartment often depends on how much time a homeowner expects to be away from 
home and who is paying the bills. Those who anticipate shorter stays, and who 
can depend on insurance money to pay for living expenses, favor hotels; those 
who expect to be homeless for some time, have loans that will need to be repaid 
and have no living reimbursements, opt for apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost is vastly different: Nice hotels run about $100 a night; furnished 
corporate apartments with month-to-month leases run about $1,550 a month for a 
one-bedroom apartment. If leases of less than a year can be found in regular 
unfurnished apartment complexes, the cost can be far lower. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever the choice, in each case homeowners used to their space and 
privacy have to adjust to having only a wall separating them from their 
neighbors and to sharing everything from laundry facilities to parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, however, homeowners interviewed said the transition has not been 
all that difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hard part in all this was making the decision where to move," said Vivian 
Boyer, who last month was forced to move out for at least six months while her 
143-unit Tarzana townhouse complex is being repaired. She and her husband, 
Martin, chose an apartment complex in Woodland Hills, where one-bedrooms begin 
at $850 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apartment living is OK, but I would not chose to do it on a permanent basis," 
said Boyer, adding that she misses her washer and dryer and hates having to 
park one car behind the other in the shared parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance purchased by the Boyers' homeowners association is paying for 
repairs, but they are responsible for the first $16,000. They also did not have 
insurance coverage for living expenses.  
</P>
<P>
 It was Marty Rosenblatt's pets that made him immediately rule out a hotel for 
temporary accommodations. Instead, he, his wife, his daughter, their dog and 
two cats moved into a two-bedroom apartment near their under-construction 
Woodland Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've managed so far, but it's not the same as our home," Rosenblatt said. 
"We are viewing this as a summer getaway." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Stockdale has daily reminders that her own house is not yet under 
construction because she can actually see it from the windows of her furnished 
apartment at the Toluca Lake Oakwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't been too bad here," she said. "It's very quiet. The people are 
friendly. We just hope that the work on our house starts before the rains 
begin." 
</P>
<P>
 At hotels, various accommodations are being made for the long-term guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term guests at the Warner Center Hilton and Towers in Woodland Hills get 
a discount from the normal $129-a-night room rate, said General Manager Fred De 
Stefano, although he would not disclose the amount of the break. Quake-repair 
refugees have stayed as long as six months at the 318-room hotel and De Stefano 
has tried to make the rooms homier by providing small refrigerators and 
additional furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 The 461-room Warner Center Marriott Hotel in Woodland Hills hired a second 
guest relations manager to specifically address the concerns of long-term 
guests, said Julie Reigle, director of sales and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have held several parties for them to get to know our staff," she said. 
"They have become like family to the hotel staff."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BEVERLY HILLS; CHICAGO 
MAN FOUND SHOT TO DEATH IN ALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities on Monday identified a 39-year-old Chicago man found shot to death 
in a Beverly Hills' alley early Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills police identified the victim as Jon Simmons, who had been 
vacationing in Los Angeles with his brother.Simmons had gone out in West 
Hollywood Saturday evening, and when he failed to return the next day, his 
brother filed a missing persons report with the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 A West Hollywood resident out for a walk came across the body at 7:20 a.m. The 
unidentified woman flagged down West Hollywood Councilman Paul Koretz, who was 
walking his dog, and he called police with his cellular telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 The man appeared to have been shot in the forehead, Koretz said. The burned 
hulk of Simmons' rental car was found in the San Gabriel Valley on Sunday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second murder in the past month in Beverly Hills, which averages 
one or two homicides a year. On Sept. 6, a Brinks armored car guard was killed 
as he was delivering money to a bank.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA MONICA; BIRTH IS 
HOSPITAL'S FIRST SINCE QUAKE SHUT IT DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The birth of Baby Matthew signified more than a labor of love for the workers 
at St. Johns Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 His birth Monday morning was the first delivery at the hospital since the Jan. 
17 Northridge earthquake severely damaged the facility and prompted the 
evacuation of hundreds of patients, including actress Elizabeth Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not until it was abruptly taken from us on Jan. 17 did many of us realize how 
good we had it,' said Howard A. Cohen, president of the medical staff. 
</P>
<P>
 After undergoing a $32-million repair job, the hospital opened its doors 
Monday at 5 a.m., giving 1,000 employees a place to work again, said 
spokeswoman Trish Bartel. However, another 1,000 lost their jobs when the 
hospital decided not to rebuild its heavily damaged north wing and instead 
demolished the eight-story tower, Bartel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake forced everything but outpatient services to be shut down. The 
hospital reopened with 262 beds instead of the pre-quake number of 501 because 
treatment is increasingly being done through outpatient care, Bartel said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first procedures by hospital workers was to help deliver Matthew 
James Onda, who was born at 8:44 a.m. to Michelle Onda. Two more women were 
expected to give birth Monday, Bartel said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; BENEFITS OF 
WORLD CUP TO CITY TOTAL $4 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena took in $2 million for its general fund and received about $2 million 
in improvements to the Rose Bowl last summer by hosting eight World Cup games, 
including the final, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had projected that extra security costs would require as much 
as $400,000 of the $2 million the city was due to receive for use of the Rose 
Bowl from World Cup USA.But unexpectedly light security demands during the 
nearly trouble-free tournament meant the city did not have to dip into the $2 
million, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup also paid for stadium improvements, including widening the Rose 
Bowl's field and building a handicapped seating area, as part of its contract 
with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena officials have earmarked $1 million of the money for more police 
officers and anti-gang and recreation programs, and are placing the rest in 
reserve.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
WIFE OF MAN KILLED BY DEPUTIES TO GET $40,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The county Claims Board on Monday agreed to pay $40,000 to the widow of a man 
deputies shot to death in May, 1992, despite a finding that the action may have 
been warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the deputies clearly and reasonably fired their weapons," 
Assistant County Counsel Robert Ambrose said in a report."However, a number of 
party-goers and neighbors have testified that the deputies fired without first 
giving any commands or warnings."  
</P>
<P>
 Laura Ponciano, the mother of four children, filed a wrongful death and 
violation of civil rights lawsuit against the county after her husband, Jose, 
was killed on May 23, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred during a party the Poncianos gave at their Inglewood 
home.  
</P>
<P>
 In trying to break up a fight between some of his guests and a group of 
party-crashers, Jose Ponciano fired two warning shots into the air, according 
to a county report. Deputies on patrol in nearby unincorporated Lennox heard 
the shots and went to investigate. They reported seeing Ponciano, with a gun in 
his hand, chasing another man down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies ordered both men to stop, according to the report, but the 
command was ignored. They said they shot Ponciano because they feared he was 
raising his gun to shoot the other man.  
</P>
<P>
 Ambrose said "it was in the best interest of the county of Los Angeles to 
settle this wrongful death, civil rights action in the amount of $40,000."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL SLIPS INTO 
SOMETHING MORE COMFORTABLE: UNIFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For third-grader Andrew Kim, wearing his new school uniform -- navy blue 
trousers and a white pullover shirt -- makes life just a little easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I don't need to think about what I'm going to wear and I don't have to 
look all around for my clothes," he said. "Wearing the uniform makes me feel 
special, too." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Mark Keppel Elementary School became the third school in Glendale 
and the latest Southland elementary campus to try on voluntary parochial-style 
uniforms for size. More than two-thirds of the school's 1,200 students were 
joined by several teachers and administrators in wearing the new school garb. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have so many different cultures at our school and this brings all the 
students together in a way that nothing else can," said third-grade teacher 
Lorna Till. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators said they tried to make sure that the uniforms would be 
affordable to all. A parent committee chose a line of clothing from Nordstrom 
that costs $9 to $21 for each piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls' uniforms are white blouses and navy blue jumpers, while the boys wear 
white pullover shirts and navy pants. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said they were inspired by the success of voluntary uniform 
programs last year in Long Beach and the Santa Clarita Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 Students at Cerritos School in southern Glendale and Fremont School in western 
Glendale began wearing uniforms when the fall semester began Sept. 8. At all 
three campuses, the style and color of the uniforms were chosen by committees 
made up of parents, staff and/or students. The logo on the Keppel uniform, 
which shows a book and pencil above the school's name, was designed by 
sixth-grader Danny Davari in a schoolwide contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really does instill a sense of pride in the kids," said Lynne 
Soule-Maggio, a past Keppel PTA president and parent of two students. "It's 
also much easier to put a uniform on my daughter than fight over what's she's 
going to wear each morning." STEVE RYFLE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The battle for the minds of students at Pacoima Elementary School -- waged 
daily by teachers competing with gangs and drugs, Pogs and MTV -- may someday 
move from the 79-year-old, cracked, creaking, dreary blue classrooms of today 
onto a new plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, there would be a carefully landscaped campus, fountains, an arbor, 
stone benches and interconnected breezeways decorated with student paintings. 
Inside, lectures on Martin Luther King Jr. would be taught before a 
three-tiered ziggurat, or Egyptian-style platform. Math problems would be 
worked out by students at low-slung, worm-shaped tables that could be 
reconfigured to seat a lone student or up to 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to keep students interested in learning. "It could happen," said 
Lawrence Gonzales, the school's principal. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week five senior UCLA Extension design students displayed the product of 
months of work they completed in an advanced interior and exterior design 
course that examined the needs of this crumbling elementary school in the San 
Fernando Valley's poorest community. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales said he plans to use the ideas, models and sketches by the UCLA 
students to sell the idea of renovating the school to local businesses, which 
he hopes will provide the funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was conceived by Jeffrey Daniels, head of UCLA Extension's 
Interior and Environmental Design Program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I focused on creating connections between the two main buildings and all the 
classrooms," said Amalia Gal, 32, of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Gal's renderings illustrate her concept of opening up the school and creating 
a more community-like atmosphere. Currently, classrooms are lined up like 
closets in a series of square rooms. One of Gal's ideas was to split the 
buildings down the middle and create an amphitheater at one end. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Nikkah, 24, said she lost track of the number of hours she spent 
analyzing the space inside the old school and creating new designs. She focused 
on revamping classrooms to provide an arts area, computer work area and 
general-subject teaching area in each room. 
</P>
<P>
 Several elementary school students inspected the efforts of the UCLA students 
and expressed wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really gonna do all this?" asked Alex Rubalcaba, a sixth-grader. "It's 
pretty nice."  
</P>
<P>
 Olga Garcia, a longtime teacher at the school, said the kind of renovation 
proposed is badly needed.  
</P>
<P>
 "We need new classrooms," she said. "The old ones are in terrible condition. 
The baseboards are awful. The floors creak and there are holes in the walls. 
When kids go into new, clean rooms, they find it exhilarating." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales plans to seek funding for the renovation as soon as possible. "This 
is the new era -- the new partnership between public and private sector," he 
said. "We're going to go to banks and say, 'You're in our community, we're in 
your community, and we serve the same people. Let's do something nice.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Other schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District will participate next 
semester in the UCLA program, called "Learning Environments for the 21st 
Century." A Pico-Union-area elementary school and a Cerritos infant-care center 
for teen-age mothers in high school will be the next projects design students 
will tackle. TIM MAY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; COUNCILMAN HELPS DEMOLISH DANGEROUS WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Usually, neighbors in the San Fernando Valley love their back yard walls -- 
those psychological barriers of concrete that erect a sense of privacy in 
urbanites living nearly cheek to cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday, Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson took a sledgehammer to 
a wall dividing two Northridge neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Geyser Street neighbors Elaine Messerman and Anne McLean celebrated the 
destruction. The six-foot-wall had kept them on edge since the Northridge 
earthquake tilted it, endangering McLean's brain-injured patients, who live on 
one side of the wall at Project Headway. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been shut in, unable to go in the back yard," said McLean of her 
six patients, adults who have suffered brain injuries.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's so good that people can do something like this." 
</P>
<P>
 McLean, director of Project Headway, said her nonprofit organization's 
Northridge house sustained about $45,000 dollars in damage. Three other homes 
operated by Project Headway were damaged as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Project Headway is a nonprofit agency, McLean said she was unable to 
get any federal aid to repair the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Messerman, a retired widow with a disability, was able to get about $10,000 in 
Federal Emergency Management Agency assistance but not enough to cover the 
$25,000 in damage to her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wrote a letter on my appeal to FEMA," said Messerman. "They said I should 
send it to Channel 2." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bernson didn't need to see it on the television news to react to the 
neighbors' problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a situation where these people really had no other place to go," said 
Bernson, who was alerted to the dilemma when Messerman called his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, there were plenty of news media representatives buzzing about 
when Bernson, several members of his staff and a few members of the Los Angeles 
Church of Christ tore down the wall with sledgehammers in less than an hour, 
then carted the pieces away in wheelbarrows. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson hopes to promote similar efforts in the future. He has submitted a 
motion to the Los Angeles City Council to authorize the California Conservation 
Corps to remove earthquake debris and perform other chores paid for by the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Bernson said, he can't do it all by himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "After about five swings, I'm ready for disability," he said. JEFF SCHNAUFER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CANOGA PARK; PARENT DONATES $15,000 TO SCHOOL

 When Karen Ly came into a large sum of money, she decided to donate $15,000 of 
it to her son's elementary school, even though the boy will be graduating in 
less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like my son to use these tools and I can do that for him.But what 
about his friend next door?" said Ly, who made the donation to the Limerick 
Avenue Elementary School in Canoga Park.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's an awful lot of children that need these resources and we need to do 
that for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the donated funds, $10,000 will go toward putting computers in the school's 
now-empty computer lab. The school had completed the construction but had run 
out of funds for the project before the computers could be purchased, according 
to school Principal Ronni Ephraim. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not a rich school," said Ephraim of the school, which is populated 
mostly by children living in neighboring housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Ly asked that the remaining $5,000 be used toward the purchase of teaching 
tools such as microscopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like a huge sum of money, but when it comes to education for our 
children and for the next generations, it is not that much," Ly said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever they need I would like to go and help teachers get the tools to be 
able to teach our children." MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS; POSSIBLE LOSS OF TEACHER PROTESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "No More Aftershocks. Keep Our Teachers," read the pickets held by the 20 
parent and student protesters Monday outside of Granada Elementary School in 
Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's enrollment is down by 30 students this year and, because of that, 
the school could lose one of its teachers to offset the lower student 
population. Parents say that would be detrimental to their children's mental 
and academic well being. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollment is down at public schools throughout the west San Fernando Valley 
and parents say it can be attributed to the January earthquake, which forced 
families to move away while their damaged homes are being repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District takes a final enrollment count of 
schools four weeks after the first day of school to determine if they have a 
uniform student-teacher ratio. Schools make up for the loss of a teacher by 
rearranging classes, often by creating split-grade levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents contend, though, that if their schools lose teachers now, once the 
displaced families return with their children, classrooms will then be too 
crowded. 
</P>
<P>
 One mother, Susan Schraut of Granada Hills, found that 66 houses in the 
elementary school's zone were for sale and 14 more were in escrow. Figures on 
apartments are still being compiled, said Schraut. 
</P>
<P>
 Tish Sternadel, whose child is in the fifth grade, said that since it has been 
established that an upper-level teacher would be transferred if enrollment does 
not go back up, her daughter would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is her last year here," Sternadel said. If the transferring occurs, she 
fears her daughter's class "is going to be very crowded." 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Julie Korenstein said that at present one of three things 
will be done about the possible loss of teachers. "We'll be letting teachers go 
within the next couple of weeks, hold teachers in place until the first of the 
year . . . or the third would be a compromise where some teachers would go and 
some would stay," Korenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers would be sent to overpopulated schools or be put into a substitute 
teaching pool if they are transferred. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the school board or district superintendent will decide the teachers' 
fate has not been determined yet, Korenstein said. MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; CITY INVITES RESIDENTS TO SPONSOR A TREE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Encouraged by the collection of more than $1,000 in private donations to a 
city beautification program, Agoura Hills officials are moving forward with 
plans to plant dozens of trees along the city's main thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
 An arborist has been hired to make recommendations about what type of tree is 
best suited for the climate, Public Works Director Vince Mastrosimone said 
Monday.Planting is expected to begin by November. 
</P>
<P>
 For $50, a tree will be planted with a plaque installed nearby with the 
donor's name, or any name the donor wants, according to Darlene Ballman, who is 
on a committee that is spearheading the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are unable to buy a street tree, you may want to make a contribution 
toward the purchase, planting and maintenance of one of the trees," reads a 
letter from the committee to city residents.  
</P>
<P>
 The money collected will go toward purchasing the trees, which cost about $20 
to $30 each, Mastrosimone said. There are also tree stakes to buy, as well as 
plant food, ties and, in some cases, root guards, which prevent roots from 
growing through sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has lost about 50 trees in the last several years to the elements and 
traffic accidents, Mastrosimone said. The goal is to plant trees in 150 empty 
tree wells in various locations. 
</P>
<P>
 The first ones will probably be planted near Kanan Road and Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pines trees, which are prone to disease, will not be planted, Mastrosimone 
said. It's likely that some type of native, drought-resistant tree will be 
chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who wants to make a donation to the tree program can send their money 
to TREE, c/o City of Agoura Hills, 30101 Agoura Court, Suite 102, Agoura Hills, 
91301. FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; COUNCIL POSTPONES VOTE ON HOTEL TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Agoura Hills City Council has decided to postpone until next May a 
decision on whether to increase bed taxes from 8% to 10% for the city's only 
hotel to make up for an anticipated $700,000 budget shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members were following a suggestion by Councilwoman Fran Pavley to 
wait until the May budget session to see if the city still needs the money that 
would be generated by the increased tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members said last week that raising taxes now for the Radisson Hotel in 
Agoura Hills could hurt business at the establishment and spoil the city's 
efforts to lure other hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 "This hotel is a focal point of future business activity in the city," said 
Councilman Ed Corridori.  
</P>
<P>
 "We should work with (hotel management) in making this hotel an economic 
resource." 
</P>
<P>
 Also last Wednesday, Pavley said that she would be willing in the future to 
reduce a recently adopted 4% utility tax if the board determines that the city 
does not need all the revenue the tax generates. 
</P>
<P>
 Corridori said after the meeting that she believes all council members support 
that idea.  
</P>
<P>
 But Pavley's announcement was greeted with skepticism by Barbara Murphy, who 
is leading a movement to recall the entire City Council over the utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll believe it when I see it," Murphy said. "They are under a lot of 
pressure right now over the recall, and they are going to do everything they 
can to avert it." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed bed tax increase -- which would raise an additional $50,000 per 
year -- was one of several deficit-cutting measures outlined in the city's 
$5.6-million 1994-95 budget. The utility tax is another part of a 
deficit-reduction plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed bed tax increase, according to City Manager Terry Matz, would put 
the city on a par with Ventura, Thousand Oaks and Westlake Village, which all 
charge 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 And it would be less, he said, than the 12% levied by Calabasas, Malibu, Santa 
Monica and Los Angeles County, or the 14% levied by the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony David, the hotel's general manager, has argued that increasing bed 
taxes would hurt business at the hotel, which gets many corporate clients. That 
means the city would ultimately get less revenue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city has no alternative other than to raise taxes, David said, it 
should at least be willing to allow him to put logo signs on the building to 
attract customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a possibility that some additional signage is going to be worked 
out," Matz said. FRANK MANNING

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: MISSION HILLS; POLICE SUBSTATION OPENS IN A MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After years of serving as a hangout for bands of young cruisers in their 
souped-up cars and trucks, La Rinda Plaza will be cruised by another kind of 
vehicle often associated with trouble.  
</P>
<P>
 And the residents couldn't be happier. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 of them came out Monday to check out the police cars and the officers 
who will drive them to and from the new Los Angeles Police Department's 
Foothill Division substation at La Rinda Plaza shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be mad at the police," said 73-year-old Eloisa Arebalos, who lives 
across the street from the mall, 14719 Rinaldi St. "For two years they would 
pass by the neighborhoods but do nothing about the problems. Now I feel safer 
with the police cars coming to the plaza." 
</P>
<P>
 Located in a former bridal shop and leased rent-free by the mall's managers, 
Sunwest Property Management, the substation will be available to police to file 
reports on a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week basis. 
</P>
<P>
 An officer will be on hand five days a week between 10 a.m. and noon to take 
complaints directly from the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people can use the center for endless problems," said Officer Beth 
Samaniego, who began working the substation Monday. She has already fielded 
complaints ranging from neighborhood panhandling to parking problems.  
</P>
<P>
 "This frees the patrol cars for serious crimes," Samaniego said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shopping center has been plagued with problems related to cruising, 
particularly the noise and traffic congestion stemming from the hundreds of 
cars that streamed in and out on Sunday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the complaints forced city officials to order the mall's managers to 
block entrances with gates on weekends, hire security and limit hours of 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the cruisers have disappeared and many of the problems along with them. 
But mall officials will appeal three of the conditions, including the 
limitation of hours, at a zoning hearing today.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's been absolutely peaceful," said Stephen Chan, managing director of 
Sunwest Property Management. "I was here over the weekend, and there was no 
cruising." 
</P>
<P>
 "The plaza itself is improving," said Officer Tim Flores, who has worked with 
the community to solve the problem. "And the community substation will help. 
Officers will become familiar with the problem spots around this area as they 
cruise around." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alarcon, who started the city crackdown on the plaza, 
called the substation "icing on the cake." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, police officers from the Foothill Division will continue the 
substation trend. The division plans two more substations, one in Sylmar and 
the other in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going back to the roots," said Capt. Ron Bergmann, commander of the 
Foothill Division. "Bringing community police back to the community." JEFF

LESS OF A DRAG; TECHNOLOGY: TWO INVENTORS SAY THEIR WIND DEFLECTOR, MOUNTED ON 
REAR OF AN AGING BAKERY TRUCK, CUTS RESISTANCE AND INCREASES FUEL EFFICIENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There's never a shortage of bizarre sights in the desert north of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But the odd-looking contraption that rolls past the Joshua trees and jack 
rabbits every weekend -- its rear end floating and its yellow yarn flapping -- 
takes the cake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tastykake truck is on the move again. 
</P>
<P>
 Myles Baker and Dave Levitt have come to race their aging bakery truck up and 
down deserted roads in an unusual fight against wind resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Their 20-year-old truck, recycled from a Philadelphia cake and pie bakery, has 
tiny elves painted on its sides. But what catches the eye is the blue plywood 
rectangle suspended from the rear -- the thing that is decorated with dozens of 
strips of yarn. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel is a wind deflector, attached by three-foot brackets to the back of 
the truck. The men say the vertical panel redirects the airflow that normally 
causes a suction effect and slows down tractor-trailers. 
</P>
<P>
 As goofy as it looks, the gadget is something the pair figure could end up 
helping save long-haul truckers millions of dollars a year in diesel fuel 
costs. But first, it has to pass the Tastykake test. 
</P>
<P>
 In the driver's seat, Baker, of Long Beach, is pushing the gas pedal to the 
floor. His eyes dart between the windshield and a pair of air-pressure gauges 
next to the steering wheel as he coaxes it to 55 m.p.h. down an empty desert 
road west of Adelanto. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing behind him is Levitt, of Pasadena. He is braced against an empty 
bread rack as he aims a camcorder at the truck's speedometer and at the 
air-pressure gauges. Levitt shouts out the speed as the truck reaches 50 
m.p.h., then 53, and finally 55. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck is shifted into neutral with a loud thump. It keeps rolling for 
nearly a minute before it coasts to a stop. Levitt keeps the camera rolling the 
whole time. 
</P>
<P>
 The camera's built-in clock lets the two 25-year-olds compare how long the 
truck coasts with the rear deflector panel positioned at various distances from 
the rear of the truck. A quarter-inch closer or farther from the truck's rear 
doors can add or subtract an extra second or so of coasting time. 
</P>
<P>
 Desert road tests that started last November support the findings of 
wind-tunnel tests with a scale-model truck, said Levitt. 
</P>
<P>
 The tunnel tests showed a reduction in drag that could cut fuel usage by about 
10% -- about $2,000 a year for the average trucker, said Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the only useful wind deflectors for big rigs have been spoilers and 
fairings that attach to the front of trucks. The Baker-Levitt device has not 
undergone any independent testing, but last week, they received a patent for 
their rear deflector. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the vehicle is moving, a vortex becomes locked between the plate and 
the truck's rear end, creating a low-pressure region. The suction created 
changes air flow patterns behind the vehicle such that base drag is reduced," 
states the patent abstract. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fascinating concept. They may have built a better mousetrap," John 
Doyle, spokesman for the American Trucking Assns., said Monday. "Fuel costs can 
be a third of operating expenses in some owner-operator companies. If it's 
truly 10%, you'd be looking at tremendous savings." 
</P>
<P>
 The country's 2 million tractor-trailers travel about 100,000 miles annually 
and get about six miles to the gallon of diesel. 
</P>
<P>
 "All drivers are looking for ways to improve fuel efficiency. That means money 
to them," Doyle said after asking for Baker's and Levitt's phone numbers. "It 
sounds interesting. The concept of being able to cut into the drag makes 
sense." Baker and Levitt say the deflector idea came three years ago when they 
were students at UCLA. They were car-pooling to an engineering class one day 
when they happened to pull behind a big rig and found themselves discussing the 
aerodynamics of the boxy trailer in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend tests became necessary after they graduated. Baker got a job 
working on supersonic airliner designs at McDonnell-Douglas. Levitt went to 
work for JPL doing design work for an upcoming Saturn space mission. They 
borrowed the bakery truck from Baker's father, Bud Baker of Apple Valley, who 
bought it years ago to use for apartment house maintenance work. 
</P>
<P>
 The desert tests -- some of which have been conducted in 105-degree weather -- 
have been an adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasional passersby stare at the Tastykake truck. Those who stop and 
aren't looking for directions to the nearest town sometimes ask if they have 
any cakes or pies for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker ended up marrying Maureen Sammon, the woman who drives the chase car 
during the deflector panel tests and watches to see which way turbulence is 
blowing yarn pieces thumb-tacked to the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 more weekends of work are needed in the desert, according to the 
pair. They are especially anxious to test in Santa Ana wind conditions, when 
they'll turn the truck into the wind "and set off some smoke bombs" for a 
makeshift wind tunnel test, said Levitt.. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Baker said, they will borrow a big rig for some true highway tests. "We 
need to know how it will affect the guy driving the Yugo next to it," and how 
it performs in the rain, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally there's the problem of what to call the device. The name "Locked 
Vortex Afterbody Plate" that the pair has been using doesn't exactly roll off a 
trucker's tongue. 
</P>
<P>
 So in honor of the bread truck they might call it the "Tasty Plate." Keep On 
Trucking Two young engineers have a new patent for a device aimed at cutting 
wind resistance on trucks. They say that a simple panel clamped on the back of 
a truck cuts wind drag for a 10% fuel savings. Wind turbulance from big rigs 
creates a suction, illustrated by sketch, that holds truck back. the inventors 
say their deflecting plate, shown below, reduces the wake to produce better 
fuel economy.

ACCESS OF POOR TO LEGAL REPRESENTATION FALLS SHARPLY, EXPERTS SAY; SERVICES: 
DOWNTURN IN ECONOMY HAS REDUCED FUNDS IN CALIFORNIA BAR ASSN. PROGRAM FOR THE 
NEEDY, L.A. CONFERENCE IS TOLD. MEANWHILE, COSTS HAVE RISEN. 
</P>

<P>
 The ability of California's poor and middle class to obtain legal 
representation in civil court cases is diminishing sharply, according to a host 
of speakers at a conference held Monday in Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are able to meet only 15% of the legal needs of the indigent poor in this 
county," and even that low figure is eroding, said Margaret Morrow, former 
president of the California State Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow said that during the past decade the number of people living below the 
poverty line in California had increased by 40%, while the number of lawyers 
providing free legal assistance declined by 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that funding for legal services programs has been slashed because of 
a reduction in funds from a California Bar Assn. program as a result of the 
decline in the state economy. The program provided a healthy chunk of the 
funding for legal services activities in California -- $22 million as recently 
as two years ago. This year, it will be only be $5.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow said the funding reductions have led to the closure of programs such as 
Westside Legal Services, which served 3,000 indigents a year, and staffing 
reductions at other legal services agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles lawyer Samuel Paz, who has been nominated for a federal court 
judgeship, added that the cost of litigation has increased so markedly in 
recent years that it also has become quite difficult for middle-class citizens 
to pursue their interests in court. And without a lawyer, he said, anyone's 
chance of success is negligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow and Paz made their remarks at the First Monday conference in Los 
Angeles, one of 12 gatherings around the country where lawyers, law students, 
law professors and judges discussed ways to increase access to the justice 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference was organized by the Alliance for Justice, a national 
association of public interest law groups. "This is an exciting and 
unprecedented event in the history of public interest law," said Nan Aaron, the 
Alliance's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the conference's goals were to "reaffirm a commitment to lawyering 
for the public good; to explore strategies for expanding access to justice for 
all Americans and for molding a federal jurisprudence wedded to core 
constitutional values." 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 people attended the Los Angeles gathering, held at a mid-Wilshire 
church. 
</P>
<P>
 Panelists discussed a host of issues. Virtually every speaker presented a grim 
picture of the ability of ordinary citizens to get justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Candace Cooper noted that there currently are 
129 languages spoken by Los Angeles County residents and said the courts have 
interpreters for only a fraction of them. Moreover, she said many of the 
typical court forms are written in language that is not comprehensible to the 
typical English-speaking person. 
</P>
<P>
 And, she said, "there is in the courts an identifiable hostility" to persons 
who represent themselves in civil cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Several speakers, including Karen Lash, associate dean of the USC Law Center, 
said the interest among law students in pursuing public interest work has grown 
substantially in recent years. However, she said it would be difficult for many 
of them to do because they have accumulated thousands of dollars of debt by the 
time they graduate and need to take high-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them is Tracey Jensen, president of the Student Bar Assn. at USC, who 
has spent summers working at San Fernando Valley Legal Services and the 
California Women's Law Center. Jensen said she hopes to work at the Women's Law 
Center after graduation, but said she is $75,000 in debt from loans she took 
out to finance her law school education. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the speakers offered a simple blueprint for any of the problems. But 
Stewart Kwoh, executive director of the Asian Pacific American Legal Center, 
said public interest groups have to do a much better job of pooling their 
resources in order to meet the challenges: "There are more mergers among the 
Fortune 500 than among nonprofits. Our 'turf mentality' has to be broken." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal appeals court Judge Stephen Reinhardt said he was cheered by the large 
gathering, but his remarks were particularly bleak. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a grim moment -- a grim period for those who believe in access to 
justice, in courts that serve humanitarian needs, in a government that cares 
for the welfare of people," the judge declared. 
</P>
<P>
 "In recent years those who would limit access to the federal courts have 
out-fought and out-smarted the rest of us in every possible way," said 
Reinhardt, one of the most outspoken liberals on the federal bench. "They have 
seized the ideological initiative and have gained victory after victory. . . ." 
 
</P>
<P>
 The judge praised the work of the alliance and other public interest groups. 
But he also said liberals need to create a new legal organization to wage "the 
spiritual, ideological struggle" for the hearts and minds of Americans against 
conservative groups "who believe that law is about cost-benefit analysis, 
property rights and the free market, not about providing a decent society for 
all people, not about expanding the rights of human beings."

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; UNIFORM POLICY GOES INTO EFFECT AT THIRD 
SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For third-grader Andrew Kim, wearing his new school uniform -- navy blue 
trousers and a white polo shirt -- makes life just a little easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I don't need to think about what I'm going to wear and I don't have to 
look all around for my clothes," he said. "Wearing the uniform makes me feel 
special, too." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Mark Keppel Elementary School became the third school in Glendale 
and the latest Southland elementary campus to try on voluntary, parochial-style 
uniforms for size. More than two-thirds of the school's 1,200 students were 
joined by several teachers and administrators in wearing the new school garb. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have so many different cultures at our school, and this brings all the 
students together in a way that nothing else can," said third-grade teacher 
Lorna Till. 
</P>
<P>
 Keppel students come from affluent and lower middle-class neighborhoods. For 
that reason, administrators said they tried to ensure the uniforms would be 
affordable to all families. A parent committee chose a line of clothing from 
Nordstrom that sells for $9 to $21 for each piece. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the quality, these uniforms are very competitively priced, but if the 
parents feel it's too expensive, we're encouraging them to buy anything navy 
blue and white," said Barbara Duncan, a school administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 As at Cerritos Elementary School in southern Glendale and Fremont Elementary 
School in western Glendale -- where students have been wearing uniforms since 
the fall semester began Sept. 8 -- Keppel's uniform program began last year 
with a parent survey, to which a majority of families responded positively, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At all three campuses, the style and color of the uniforms were chosen by 
committees of parents, staff and/or students. The logo on the Keppel uniform, 
which shows a book and pencil above the school's name, was designed by 
sixth-grader Danny Davari in a schoolwide contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos Principal Kim Bishop said school uniforms were brought up during 
discussions about a new school dress code aimed at prohibiting gang-like attire 
on campus. Now, she said about 97% of the school's 450 students wear the 
voluntary uniforms Monday through Thursday, with a "free dress day" on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some problems with students who didn't dress appropriately, but with 
the kids wearing uniforms we've found they come to school looking sharp and 
ready for learning," Bishop said. "The teachers have also said they've noticed 
a marked improvement in terms of behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Even at Fremont, which is the smallest of the Glendale school district's 19 
elementary campuses and is located in one of the city's poorest areas, about 
80% of the students are wearing uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale school officials said they were inspired by the success of voluntary 
uniform programs that began last year in Long Beach and the Santa Clarita 
Valley. Students at George Washington Elementary School in Burbank also began 
wearing uniforms recently. In the next few years, students at several more 
Glendale schools are expected to don uniforms under Glendale Schools 2000, a 
districtwide reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really does instill a sense of pride in the kids," said Lynne 
Soule-Maggio, a past PTA president at Keppel and parent of two students. "It's 
also much easier to put a uniform on my daughter than fight over what's she's 
going to wear each morning." STEVE RYFLE

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; 4 SOUGHT IN ATTACK ON 19-YEAR-OLD MAN 
</P>

<P>
 Police said Monday they are seeking four teen-agers who attacked a 19-year-old 
Glendale man at a gas station Sunday night, kicking, beating and shooting at 
him before they sped away in two cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, who was treated at a local hospital for cuts to his head and arm 
after the attack, pulled into a Shell station at 625 N. Pacific Ave. about 11 
p.m. and was approached by one of the teen-agers, who were sitting in their 
cars on the opposite side of the gas pump.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said the teen-ager shouted the name of a "tagging crew," or 
graffiti-spraying gang, and took off his shirt and challenged the victim to a 
fight, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the fight, two more of the teen-agers entered the brawl, one of whom 
had a shank. The victim wrestled the weapon away and managed to slash at his 
attackers with it. But the fourth teen-ager then entered the fray with a gun, 
believed to be a .25-caliber semiautomatic pistol, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun-toting youth fired two shots at the ground, then two shots at the 
victim's car, destroying the front and rear windshields. Then he fired a fifth 
shot at the victim, which missed, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the police report, the victim told officers that he then dived 
onto the ground, and the teen-ager with the gun walked alongside him and pulled 
the trigger, but the gun was empty.  
</P>
<P>
 Then all four youths kicked and beat the man as he lay on the ground. The 
victim managed to get up and run to the clerk's window to ask for help, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects were described as Latino, ages 16 to 18 and 5 feet, 4 inches to 5 
feet, 8 inches in height. Two were in a red Toyota Celica convertible and the 
other two were riding in a white full-sized American car, possibly a Chevrolet, 
with chrome Dayton rims, police said. STEVE RYFLE

WARNER BROS. TO SUBMIT A 20-YEAR PLAN; BURBANK: THE DOCUMENT WILL DETAIL 
DEVELOPMENT FOR ITS 106-ACRE LOT, OFFICES ON WARNER BOULEVARD AND 30-ACRE 
STUDIO RANCH. 
</P>

<P>
 Warner Bros. executives announced Monday that the entertainment giant will 
submit to city officials within the next few weeks a 20-year master plan for 
overhauling its main studio lot. They released few details of the plan, which 
will require an environmental impact report and a series of public hearings 
that could take up to a year before it can be submitted to the Burbank City 
Council. But officials said the document will outline the company's long-term 
development goals for its 106-acre lot and office facilities on Warner 
Boulevard and the 30-acre studio ranch on Hollywood Way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Warner Bros. has been a significant part of the Burbank economy and a major 
community employer for more than six decades," Dan Garcia, vice president of 
real estate planning, said in a statement. "The master plan reconfirms our 
company's commitment to continuing that relationship well into the next 
century."  
</P>
<P>
 The announcement of the Warner Bros. plan comes roughly one year after the 
City Council approved a $600-million blueprint for expansion of the Walt Disney 
studios and office space. The Disney master plan included construction of three 
office buildings, several sound stages and a new headquarters for the studio's 
animation department near Buena Vista Street and the Ventura Freeway, which is 
nearing completion. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials contacted late Monday declined to comment on the Warner Bros. 
announcement until the studio submits its plans for review.  
</P>
<P>
 But Ted McConkey, president of Burbank Rancho Homeowners Inc., said he expects 
the plan to be even larger than Disney's, because Warner Bros. properties are 
three times as big as Disney's 44-acre lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an old studio, and over the years they have not done a lot to keep it 
upgraded," said McConkey, whose group represents homeowners who live west of 
the Disney and Warner Bros. studio complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 McConkey said traffic along Riverside Drive, which winds through the Rancho 
area en route to the city's Media District, has steadily increased since 1990, 
when Burbank adopted the Media District Specific Plan, a growth-control measure 
restricting studio-related development to the southwestern portion of the city. 
With the growth of Disney and Warners, he said he expects the trend may 
continue.  
</P>
<P>
 "We know we're going to be impacted. We just don't know how significantly," 
McConkey said.

SUIT FILED IN SIKH TEMPLE DISPUTE; LEGAL: PLAINTIFFS ASK FOR NEW ELECTIONS FOR 
TEMPLE DIRECTORS AND SEEK TO HAVE THE BUILDING OPEN FOR WORSHIP BY DISSIDENT 
GROUPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A long-running dispute that once led to violence between two groups at a Sikh 
temple was back in court Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 members of the Sikh Gurdwara temple in the 7600 block of 
Lankershim Boulevard in North Hollywood filed suit against the temple's 
directors, asking the Los Angeles Superior Court to order them not to close the 
temple to dissident groups and to hold elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit is similar to one filed nearly a year ago by a group of Sikhs 
against many of the same directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit filed Monday alleges that Gursharan S. Nat and 50 unnamed 
defendants disrupted religious proceedings at the temple on Oct. 3, 1993 by 
spraying a tear gas-like substance on congregation members. 
</P>
<P>
 When the members tried to flee, the lawsuit alleges, Nat and the other 50 
defendants beat them with metal bars and microphone stands. The suit contends 
the beatings were authorized by the temple's directors, who were also named as 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiff group also alleges that they were deprived of their right to 
worship because the directors closed the temple three days later, and asked for 
unspecified damages and a court order requiring the directors not to close the 
temple and to allow elections to be held for their positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The directors could not be reached for comment Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's lawsuit is the latest development in a series of legal battles 
between at least two Sikh factions over the North Hollywood temple. 
</P>
<P>
 The temple's directors filed their own lawsuit last year, alleging that the 
dissidents had beaten several of them during the fracas Oct. 3, which prompted 
them to close the temple until some of the dissidents took over the building. 
The directors won temporary restraining orders against the dissidents, who 
subsequently sued the directors.

VALLEY INTERVIEW; COUPLE FINDS BIRTH AT HOME EMPOWERING, SAFE AND COMFORTABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joanne and Bruce Shannahoff didn't bring their 9-day-old daughter home from 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the baby, Sophie Marie Shannahoff, was born in the bedroom of 
the family's Northridge home. 
</P>
<P>
 The home birth was the result of nearly nine months of preparation by the 
couple, who decided against repeating the experience they had during the 
hospital birth of their first child, Molly. She was delivered by Cesarean 
section while Joanne was under anesthesia. 
</P>
<P>
 It is estimated that about 5% of births statewide are at home, a practice 
hampered by both legal and medical constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 California insurance companies have stopped providing coverage to 
nurse-midwives for home births. And most physicians frown on the practice. The 
former president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 
Dr. Keith Russell, once described home births as child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shannahoffs' case was complicated, from the traditional medical point of 
view, by the fact that Joanne's first baby was born by Cesarean section. 
Generally, physicians do not recommend a vaginal delivery following C-sections. 
</P>
<P>
 That did not deter Joanne Shannahoff -- a former graphic arts designer for the 
city's Redevelopment Agency -- who found a midwife with 20 years experience 
willing to direct the birth. Bruce, a chiropractor, assisted, along with a 
birthing instructor who served as the team's labor coach. 
</P>
<P>
 A physician agreed to be on call should there be an emergency, but she was not 
needed. Mother and baby are healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Why did you decide to have a baby at home?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: (Joanne) You can have a baby at a hospital; you can have a baby at an 
alternative birth center, or you can have a baby at home. My hospital 
experience was not one that I wanted to repeat. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was more than that. I felt that home birth was safer for the baby and 
the mother, more comfortable, and it was in keeping with how I felt about birth 
in general, that it is not a medical problem. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought my chances of having a vaginal birth after Cesarean were greater 
with a midwife, and their type of care, I felt, would be more personalized. 
</P>
<P>
 I think it is the greatest thing in the world. I'm very proud and very happy. 
Our child is calm. She didn't have to move from a hospital to a home. 
</P>
<P>
 There is so much that I've gained. Not just the birth, but as a human being. 
It's given me greater confidence in myself. 
</P>
<P>
 (Bruce) A home birth is something that takes planning and preparation. It is 
not something you do because you don't want to drive over to the hospital. It 
has to be a thoughtful process. 
</P>
<P>
 Why at home? It seems that when you go into a hospital to have a baby, a 
countdown time starts. And if you don't have a baby on their schedule, they are 
going to start to insist that it is time to cut it out. It is unfair to the 
woman because it puts her under a tremendous amount of pressure -- the kind of 
emotional pressure that can prevent her from progressing as she should. 
</P>
<P>
 So the relaxed atmosphere at home, combined with the caring and the knowledge 
of a midwife, allows the woman the time and space to complete the natural 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 If we were going to have another child, I couldn't imagine not doing it this 
way. I think if other people were open to it, and experienced it, they would 
feel exactly the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 Home birth is about empowering women. The hospital experience and the 
traditional medical experience, where you have six routine ultrasounds and an 
amniocentesis and fetal monitoring and drugs that are all basically telling the 
woman that she isn't just capable of having a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne, I see her as having taken back her power and her womanhood, and it's 
beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby was born in the room we sleep in, the place where the baby was 
conceived. A home birth steals back birthing from being a medical procedure to 
being a family event again. It is a bonding experience for the whole family. It 
allows the family to experience the joy of it, the wonder of it. Birth should 
be a family event as opposed to some kind of medical problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What didn't you like about the hospital birth?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Joanne) What I didn't like most of all was that you are not in charge. It 
is very important that I be in control. The people who take care of you, you 
need to trust them to make certain calls, but it shouldn't be up to them what 
happens; it's a woman's choice. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't like fetal monitors. They use a fetal monitor for everything, to tell 
you how the birth is going, and not looking at the person. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't like the food. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Preparation?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Joanne) The schedule is the same as seeing a doctor. You go once a month 
and then you go every two weeks, then you go every week. However the time I 
spent with a midwife was a lot greater. I probably saw more of my midwife for 
the first session than I saw a doctor throughout the entire pregnancy. She 
spends 45 minutes to an hour. You for your nutrition, your emotional 
well-being, your physical well-being, your spiritual well-being, everything 
there is. 
</P>
<P>
 I did a lot of reading about home birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The birth ? 
</P>
<P>
 A: (Joanne) It was wonderful. I think we paid closer attention to my body and 
what was going on with the baby and in preparing me for the birth. I took a lot 
of different herbs and vitamins to prepare my cervix, to soften my cervix. I 
exercised. I took yoga, had chiropractic adjustments on a regular basis, had 
acupuncture. 
</P>
<P>
 So my body did what it was supposed to do very quickly. My water broke in a 
restaurant at 7 at night. I started labor within 20 minutes, and the baby was 
born just a little more than four hours later.  
</P>
<P>
 When my doctor suggested that I walk during labor in the last birth, I walked, 
but I did not walk during contractions. It didn't do anything for expediting 
the birth. I must have walked for two hours, but my cervix would not dilate. My 
midwife told me to walk through the contractions. So this time, I walked around 
the block and went from three centimeters and dilated to eight. So by the time 
I got back I was ready to have the child. 
</P>
<P>
 I had a completely unmedicated birth. I haven't even taken a Tylenol. My head 
was clear through the whole thing. The last time, I was out for the birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you go about getting resources and help?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Joanne) A great organization for me was I CAN, International Cesarean 
Awareness Network, based in Los Angeles. They help women be aware of Cesarean 
births and to help them make them own choice. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two different kinds of midwives. One is called direct-entry. One is 
nurse-midwives, who are RNs. They are easy to find, they advertise in the phone 
book and various papers. It is harder to find a direct entry. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why is having a vaginal delivery after a Cesarean considered dangerous?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Joanne) You have a scar on the uterus after a C-section, and a lot of 
medical doctors say not to have a vaginal birth after that because the scar 
might rupture. But the actual risk for that rupture for a woman who is birthing 
a second time is lower than a woman who has the same kind of problem the first 
time she gives birth. Again, it is something you can transport for. And even if 
it does, chances are it will be only a part rupture, and that can be taken care 
of afterward.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Were you nervous about it?  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Joanne) During the pregnancy, yes, of course. I found it was very 
important to talk about it, make sure I had a good backup and trusted my 
midwife to make the right decision if I needed to be transported. We discussed 
this at length. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time the baby came, I was ready. I didn't have that fear. 
</P>
<P>
 (Bruce) I don't think the experience was unique. I think there are more people 
who are opening to the idea of doing it. And in fact, when we have all these 
concerns about health care costs and the complications of medical care, perhaps 
if more births started as home births, where people are fully prepared and 
ready to transport in case of an emergency, then would probably find more 
successful births in general and fewer Cesarean births overall and probably 
less expense.

COUNCIL PANEL BACKS CONDO REPAIR LOANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles city housing panel recommended Monday the creation of loan 
programs to help condominium owners rebuild and to allow investors to buy and 
repair damaged apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest effort to rebuild the city's quake-damaged housing stock, the 
programs would provide zero- or low-interest loans from a $318-million pool of 
federal and local housing repair funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The loan programs, recommended by the council's Housing and Community 
Redevelopment Committee, must win final approval by the entire City Council 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The program for condo owners alone, city officials estimate, could help 
rebuild between 3,000 and 5,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to condo owners who complained that they could not pay to repair 
their damaged units, the panel voted to provide zero-interest loans to 
individual owners and to condo associations that suffered damage to common 
areas in the condo complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of many quake-damaged condominiums have yet to begin repairs 
because major fixes often require the support of a majority of individual 
owners. In some cases, condo owners are in legal squabbles with each other over 
whether to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we are helping out where there is an unmet need," said Bob Moncrief, 
the city's housing director. He noted that the Small Business Administration 
has received 1,900 loan applications for condo projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The loan program would be offered to individual condo owners and associations 
that have already been rejected by other private or government loan programs.  
</P>
<P>
 Associations interested in a loan to repair common areas must get a majority 
of the members to agree to take on the loan and each pay a "pro rata" share of 
the monthly payments. Individual owners can apply for separate loans without a 
vote of the entire association. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds must be paid off over a 30-year period with the first payment 
deferred for five years. The loan program will provide a maximum of $35,000 per 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors interested in buying and rehabilitating damaged apartment buildings 
would be able to get 30-year loans with interest rates that vary from zero to 
4%, based on how many units are set aside for low-income tenants.  
</P>
<P>
 In related actions, the housing panel recommended approval of four emergency 
loans totaling $6.59 million to rebuild four quake-damaged apartment buildings 
in Sherman Oaks and Studio City, which will provide 243 apartments.

CITY OFFERS RETRAINING FOR QUAKE BUSINESS VICTIMS; RECOVERY: INCENTIVES WILL 
STEER OWNERS OF DAMAGED ENTERPRISES TOWARD INDUSTRIES EXPECTED TO FLOURISH IN 
THE FUTURE. 
</P>

<P>
 To rebuild a local economy shaken by the Northridge quake, Los Angeles city 
officials said Monday they plan to help retrain owners and workers of some 
quake-damaged businesses to enter new "growth industries." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city plans to conduct surveys of thousands of quake-damaged 
business owners during the next three months, looking for ways to help them 
recover, according to Mary Leslie, Mayor Richard Riordan's deputy for economic 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's latest efforts to help the business recovery were made public 
Monday, about three months after City Controller Rick Tuttle accused the mayor 
of failing to play a strong enough leadership role in rebuilding damaged 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan aides rejected the charges, saying the mayor had initiated several 
recovery programs that had simply not been heavily publicized. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to the latest city effort will be the release next week of a report by 
economist David Friedman analyzing the city's business climate and identifying 
those industries that are expected to flourish in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie said city officials will study the report and use federal funds and 
local incentives to steer the owners of quake-damaged businesses toward the 
growth industries. To aid in this effort, the city will tap an $80-million 
federal grant to help retrain workers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city wants to avoid going to the trouble of rejuvenating businesses that 
eventually fail anyway due to natural and foreseeable changes in the economy, 
Leslie said. "We don't want to come across a bunch of empty lots in the next 
two years," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another element of the city's recovery effort disclosed Monday is a hot line 
for business owners, 1-(800)-CITY-AID, which provides bilingual information on 
assistance centers and business loan programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The surveys of damaged businesses are expected to be completed by Jan. 17, the 
one-year anniversary of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 One survey will poll the nearly 20,000 businesses that reported physical and 
financial quake damage but were rejected for SBA loans. Another survey will 
attempt to reach the 88,000 or so business owners in the city who took out SBA 
loan papers but failed to return the applications.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; STRING OF VEHICLE CRASHES KILLS 6 PEOPLE OVER 
2 DAYS; ANTELOPE VALLEY: A 1-YEAR-OLD BOY IS ONE OF A PAIR OF FATALITIES IN AN 
ACCIDENT IN LANCASTER ON MONDAY NIGHT. FOUR OTHERS DIE IN OTHER INCIDENTS.

<P>
 Two people, including a 1-year-old boy, were killed in a traffic accident in 
Lancaster on Monday night, bringing to six the number of persons killed in 
Antelope Valley crashes in two days. 
</P>
<P>
 The other four were killed in a string of single-death accidents that began 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The child and an adult were killed about 6:30 p.m. on Johnson Road at the 
point where it becomes 110th Street West, said California Highway Patrol 
Officer Shirley Gaines. 
</P>
<P>
 No other details were available. 
</P>
<P>
 One man was killed Monday afternoon in the hills near the California Aqueduct 
and Avenue M when his off-road truck overturned on top of him, according to 
Sgt. Bruce Burleson of the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station. The dead man was 
not identified. 
</P>
<P>
 A 75-year-old Palmdale man, Clifford Judevine, died after his car collided 
with another about 8:15 a.m. Monday at 3rd Street East and Avenue P. 
</P>
<P>
 His car was hit by an auto driven by Maria Miller, 36, of Palmdale, police 
said. Both drivers were taken to Desert Palms Community Hospital where Judevine 
died, Sheriff's Investigator David Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was in stable condition with face cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson said Judevine failed to yield the right of way to Miller, who was not 
cited for any violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a Palmdale woman who died Sunday in a crash that injured her three 
children on 55th Street East at Avenue R-8 in Palmdale was identified by 
deputies as Maisabel Jacobo, 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobo's younger children -- Mayra Garcia, 2, and Luis Garcia, 4 -- were 
airlifted to Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena with serious injuries, 
deputies said. Hospital officials would not reveal the children's condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver's third child, Ignacio Jacobo, 6, was treated at Antelope Valley 
Hospital and released to relatives, Sheriff's Deputy Mike Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one in Jacobo's car was wearing seat belts, and there were no child 
restraint seats in the vehicle, Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another accident, which occurred at 7:10 p.m. Sunday, a 22-year-old 
Lancaster man was killed in a head-on collision on Sierra Highway near West 
Mint Canyon Road in Agua Dulce. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancaster man's station wagon drifted over the center line and struck a 
pickup truck, said CHP Officer Michelle Esposito. 
</P>
<P>
 A coroner's spokesman said the Lancaster man's name was being withheld pending 
notification of his family. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the pickup, Douglas Siewert, 39, of Canyon Country was reported 
in good condition Monday at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOLLAR RALLIES ON TRADE DEAL; T-BOND YIELDS PUSH HIGHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The weekend trade accord between the United States and Japan pushed the dollar 
up Monday against leading currencies, with the buck briefly hitting the 
psychologically important level of 100 yen for the first time in a month. 
</P>
<P>
 But bond and stock markets were weak on the first day of the fourth quarter. 
Long-term bond yields jumped to new 27-month highs on word of an unexpected 
surge in raw materials prices. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average added 3.70 points to 
3,846.89, but every other major market index closed lower. Markets were also 
broadly lower in Europe and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar was the markets' focus early in the day. The partial trade truce 
between Japan and the United States at least removed the threat of another 
forced devaluation of the dollar, so a "relief" rally ensued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed in New York at 99.58 yen, up from Friday's 99.15, after 
hitting 100.10 yen in the morning -- the highest since Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar also closed at 1.554 German marks, up from 1.552. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, gloomy traders continued to sell on another batch of 
strong economic reports. Most troubling for bonds was Monday's report by the 
National Assn. of Purchasing Management, a manufacturing trade association. 
</P>
<P>
 The group said its price index, which measures what manufacturers pay for raw 
materials, rose to 77.1% in September, the highest since August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 That sparked new inflation worries and sent interest rates rising across the 
board. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds rose to a 27-month high of 7.85%, up 
from 7.81% on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Analysts worry that the economy's strength will force the Federal Reserve 
Board to officially raise interest rates for a sixth time this year, perhaps as 
early as Friday -- when the government reports on September employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock traders Monday seemed to be bracing for a Fed hike. In the broad market, 
losers topped winners by 13 to 8 on the New York Stock Exchange, and every 
broad market index fell marginally. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say the market's best hope is that third-quarter corporate earnings 
top expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 But a report Monday from Advanced Micro Devices, a major semiconductor maker, 
didn't help sentiment: AMD reported net income on target (up 41%), but warned 
of lower profit margins in the current quarter. That sent semiconductor stocks 
tumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * AMD's shares slumped 3 1/4 to 26 1/2 after its third-quarter report and its 
warnings about fourth-quarter results, which the company said would be hurt by 
higher costs associated with opening two new factories. 
</P>
<P>
 Other chip stocks falling included Intel, down 1 1/4 to 60 1/4; Micron 
Technology, off 2 1/8 to 32 3/8; Texas Instruments, down 1 7/8 to 66 1/8, and 
Cyrix, off 2 7/8 to 42 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Financial stocks were broadly lower as interest rates rose. Merrill Lynch 
lost 1 1/8 to 33 1/2, Dean Witter dropped 3/4 to 36 7/8, First Interstate fell 
7/8 to 80 1/4 and SunAmerica was off 7/8 to 40 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the plus side, drug stocks continued their recent rally. Merck rose 7/8 
to 36 1/2, Schering-Plough gained 1 to 72 and Warner-Lambert added 1 to 81 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trading was heavy in Pacific Gas & Electric, which fell 7/8 to 21 7/8, and 
in SCEcorp, which rose 1/2 to 13 3/8. Rumors had some institutional investors 
trading out of PG&E and into SCEcorp. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, European markets were hit by renewed selling. London's FTSE 100 
index dropped 42.8 points to 2,983.5 and Paris' CAC 40 slumped 26.42 points to 
1,852.83. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City shares also tumbled as nervous investors sold in the wake of the 
last week's political assassination. The Bolsa index sank 60.1 points, or 2.2%, 
to 2,686.01. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei average gained 86.22 points to 19,650.03.

 T-Bill Rates Rise to 3-Year High: The Treasury Department sold $12.5 billion 
of new three-month bills at an average discount rate of 4.92%, up from 4.79% 
last week. Another $12.4 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average 
discount rate of 5.38%, up from 5.22%.The three-month bill rate was the highest 
since they sold for 4.99% on Oct. 28, 1991. The six-month bill rate was the 
highest since they averaged 5.39% on Sept. 3, 1991. The new discount rates 
understate the actual return to investors: 5.05% for three-month bills, with a 
$10,000 bill selling for $9,875.60, and 5.61% for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,728.00. The discount rate reflects the price discount received when 
government securities are purchased at less than face value.

 Television: Capital Cities/ABC Inc., long considered one of the best TV 
station operators in the country, has agreed to purchase two stations -- 
WJRT-TV in Flint, Mich., and WTVG-TV in Toledo, Ohio -- for $155 million from 
SJL Management Corp. Both stations secure Cap Cities outlets on the more 
desirable VHF band. The purchases, which are expected to be completed sometime 
in the first quarter of next year, are the latest maneuvers by the broadcast 
networks to lock up their local distribution outlets in the wake of Fox's 
historic raid on eight CBS affiliates earlier this year.The latest purchases 
will bring Cap Cities' stable of TV stations to 10 outlets representing 
coverage of 24.2% of all TV homes. Federal regulations prohibit the ownership 
of more than 12 stations, or 25% coverage, whichever is reached first.

 Exhibition: The Samuel Goldwyn Theater Group, a subsidiary of Samuel Goldwyn 
Co., plans to increase the number of movie screens it operates by 30%. The 
company is building new theaters in San Francisco and Minneapolis. It also 
recently acquired theaters in Berkeley; Houston; Albany, N.Y., and Piedmont, 
Calif. Goldwyn hopes to have 250 screens by 2000.

CHRIS FOSTER: HAWKINS' JUGGLING ACT IS TOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today on Scared Straight , the Sarah Hawkins Story. 
</P>
<P>
 Listen and learn. This is no way to be a student-athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins, a senior at Newport Harbor, is a promising tennis player. But does 
she while away the hours thinking about that perfect serve? Nope. She wastes 
precious time on civics. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, she hits the books as hard as a lob. But is she reading "Towel Sweat: 
The Jimmy Connors Story"? Nope. Biology. 
</P>
<P>
 She's in the process of planning her future. The tour, right, just like 
Jennifer Capriati? Nope. College. 
</P>
<P>
 Continue on this path, kids, and you could end up educated, happy and 
fulfilled. Don't let this happen to you.  
</P>
<P>
 OK, so Hawkins doesn't exactly get high marks for athletic overkill. Her 
racket is more than keeping above that 2.0 line. Yet, while she may not be a 
tennis bum, she's not a bookworm either. 
</P>
<P>
 There are better players. There are better students. But jugglers? It's 
doubtful anyone does that ginzu-knife-thing any better. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins' 3.4 grade-point average isn't going to make her valedictorian. But it 
will get her into college. 
</P>
<P>
 Her backhand isn't going to serve her up strawberries and cream at Wimbledon. 
But it will get her ranked among the top 20 in Southern California in her age 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, her life track isn't out of whack. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a delicate balance, which she handles. Heck, she even tosses in a spot on 
the ASB council and a position on the school newspaper and still doesn't lose 
her academic equilibrium. 
</P>
<P>
 Her secret? 
</P>
<P>
 "I go home and study until I've done everything I need to do," Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmm, hard work. We may be on to something here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned how to manage my time," Hawkins said. "And I use flash cards for 
everything. I have drawers full of flash cards. It's the secret to my success. 
Basically, I'm the type of student who studies hard and gets Bs." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, but at what expense? There are sacrifices, you know. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Hawkins what's new on TV, or even what's old, and she shrugs. Channel 
surfing isn't her sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is always talking about these shows that I know nothing about," 
Hawkins said. "I can't tell you what's happening on 'Melrose Place' or 'Beverly 
Hills 90210.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Not missing a thing, kid. Well, Shannen Doherty did leave the show. You see, 
Brenda . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I don't want it to sound like I lock my door the minute I get home and 
study," Hawkins said. "I talk on the phone, I go out and do things with my 
friends. Believe me, I have plenty of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 And, golly, tennis hasn't suffered? 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins still spends two to three hours a day honing her skills, giving her 
that competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
 She reached the round of 16 at Ojai in the girls' 18-year-old division last 
year. She was Sea View League singles champion as a sophomore and teamed with 
Mara Colaizzi to win the league doubles' title last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis definitely fits into her future. It just doesn't dominate it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to play in college, but that's in the back of my mind," Hawkins said. 
"I'm not looking at schools just for tennis, but I love the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially at Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tennis can be such an individual sport," Hawkins said, "but in high school 
tennis, I can cheer for my teammates and shout, 'Go Newport,' instead of just 
sitting on the sidelines. It's fun. You get to be with your friends and goof 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 So let's see. She's a good student. She's a good tennis player. She has good 
fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Is that any way to be a good student-athlete?

NOTEBOOK; MARINA'S CROUCH PRODUCES IN HER OTHER SPORT TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Marcy Crouch was last year's Southern Section player of the year in softball 
and the defender of the year in soccer. That's common knowledge. But Crouch is 
also a big hit in volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 She had 27 kills last week in Marina's sweep of Long Beach Millikan -- then 
No. 1 in the Southern Section Division II rankings. Thanks in large part to 
Crouch, Marina is ranked seventh in Orange County. She was on the 
all-tournament team at the Orange County Championships and is averaging six 
kills per game. 
</P>
<P>
 "She could be amazing," Marina Coach Jason Bilbruck said. "I mean, this is her 
third sport -- it's kind of scary. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she would have played club and it would have been her (primary) sport, she 
might have been able to reach the Misty May level. What sets Misty apart is 
that she knows volleyball; what sets Marcy apart is that she's just a winner." 
</P>
<P>
 Crouch has won three Southern Section titles, two in soccer and one in 
softball. A volleyball title would give her an intriguing triple crown. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The water polo season wastes no time in getting down to brass tacks. Though 
this is the first week of league play, six leagues feature games that could 
decide who wins the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Brea-Olinda and Magnolia, which tied for last year's Orange League 
championship, meet at Magnolia. Brea, top-ranked in Division VI and 
sixth-ranked in the county, is expected to easily win the title, but Magnolia 
is likely the Wildcats' main competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, Cypress plays at El Dorado in the Empire League, No. 3 Servite is 
at Tustin in the Golden West League and No. 5 El Toro plays its first Sea View 
League game since 1983 when it plays at No. 2 Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, No. 10 Costa Mesa plays Laguna Beach in the Pacific Coast League and 
No. 1 San Clemente plays host to Capistrano Valley in the South Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are also some key showdowns in girls' volleyball, which begins league 
play today. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor, No. 1 in the county, opens the Sea View League with a home 
match against Corona del Mar, the two-time defending Southern Section and State 
Division I champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighth-ranked Dana Hills plays host to ninth-ranked Mater Dei in a South Coast 
League match and third-ranked Edison plays at Esperanza in a Sunset League 
match. In the Century League, defending league champion Foothill plays at 
undefeated Orange.

 Medical update: Pacifica Coach Bill Craven said wide receiver Mike Parsons, 
who suffered head and neck injuries Friday during the Mariners' game against 
Rancho Alamitos, underwent tests Monday at Garden Grove Hospital and Medical 
Center. Parsons is expected to return to school today and be ready to play 
Friday against Garden Grove. 
</P>

 Rancho Alamitos Coach Doug Case said lineman Jason Bluestein, who hurt his 
back during Friday's game, returned to school Monday and will see doctors today 
for clearance to play Friday against La Quinta.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: NEW IMAGE SHARES DROP AFTER DEAL FALLS THROUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shares of New Image Industries Inc., a Canoga Park-based maker of dental 
imaging devices, tumbled sharply last week after Dentsply International Inc. 
backed out of a deal to acquire New Image. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Leddington, chief executive of New Image, said the deal unraveled over 
"differences of opinion on certain issues," including New Image's chances for 
successfully defending a patent infringement lawsuit.Leddington said New Image 
is being sued by High Tech Medical Instrumentation Inc. of San Carlos. High 
Tech claims that its design of a camera component is being used by New Image in 
violation of patent laws, Leddington said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are of course disappointed" about the collapse of the Dentsply deal, 
Leddington said. "However, New Image is a strong company and we do not expect 
this development to materially affect our business or operations." 
</P>
<P>
 New Image also said it has been named in a purported class action lawsuit 
alleging violations of securities laws. Leddington would not discuss details of 
the suit, but said the company received a copy of the complaint Friday, and 
that one of the plaintiffs in the suit is a shareholder in the company. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 28, Dentsply, based in Des Plaines, Ill., said it had signed a letter 
of intent to acquire New Image for $16.375 a share in cash. New Image shares 
rose 37% on the news. But Dentsply's letter of intent was terminated Sept. 27, 
New Image said, and that day the price of New Image stock quickly fell from $13 
a share to $8.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: LOCAL AUTO SALVAGER BUYS MIDWEST FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Insurance Auto Auctions Inc., a North Hollywood salvager of damaged cars, said 
that it has acquired Midwest Auto Pool Corp., a privately held salvage pool 
based in Granite City, Ill., that serves the St. Louis, Mo., area. 
</P>
<P>
 The company declined to give the terms of the agreement. Midwest Auto Pool 
Corp. processes about 10,000 cars per year. Insurance Auto Auctions processes 
about 300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition represents the company's first foray into the Missouri market. 
Insurance Auto Auctions buys wrecked cars from insurance companies and salvages 
them or disposes of them at 36 sites around the country.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: VENTURA COUNTY NATIONAL TO OFFER NEW STOCK IN '95 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Still under pressure to meet federally imposed capital requirements, Ventura 
County National Bancorp said it will try to raise $5 million by offering new 
stock at the beginning of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The proceeds of the sale will be used to help the Oxnard-based bank meet 
capital ratio requirements imposed by federal regulators earlier this 
year.Under an agreement with the Comptroller of the Currency, Ventura County 
National was expected to raise two ratios that measure equity as a percentage 
of risk-based assets by Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Banks, chief financial officer of Ventura County National, said the bank 
remains well short of reaching the ratio requirements. In the meantime, the 
bank has applied for an extension of the Sept. 30 deadline. "We've been advised 
by our counsel that there is no risk of being taken over," Banks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks said Ventura County National expects to begin offering the new shares in 
early 1995, when the price and number of shares will be established. The shares 
will first be made available to investors who already hold common shares of 
Ventura County National. Unsold shares will then be offered to outside 
investors.

GM GETS IT IN GEAR; AUTOMOBILES: VALUE PRICING STRATEGY HELPS CAR MAKER REV UP 
ITS MARKET SHARE, WHICH HAD PLUNGED IN CALIFORNIA OVER A DECADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a decade of losing ground to foreign car makers and domestic rivals in 
the all-important California car market, General Motors appears finally to have 
launched an effective counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks partly to an innovative -- though not universally acclaimed -- sales 
strategy called value pricing, GM has boosted its long-sagging California sales 
across its seven divisions by 20% during the 1994 model year, GM said. In 
contrast, during the same September-through-August period, car and truck sales 
were up 4% for the balance of the automotive industry, GM said, citing figures 
compiled by J.D. Power & Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 The sales surge lifted GM's share of the California market to 22.1% through 
June, up 1.6% since August, 1993, according to the latest statistics available 
from R.L. Polk & Co. That was the best showing by any auto maker and a 
remarkably hefty gain for a company that watched in agony as GM's California 
market share slid 10% in 10 years, finally crashing at 18% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 As the 1995 model year gets under way, GM says it is in a virtual dead heat 
with Ford for the top spot in the California car market, and GM's sales 
momentum won't be hurt now that last week's strike has been settled at its 
plant in Flint, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of factors contributed to GM's California turnaround, including a 7% 
decline in the dollar against the Japanese yen in the past year. Exchange rate 
pressures have therefore pushed up the price of Japanese cars sold in the 
United States, making many American models a better deal. As a result, GM said 
Japanese auto makers lost 3.4% of the California market from September through 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 A gradually recovering California economy has also boosted GM sales. But if 
you ask GM officials why their company's gains outpaced the advances of Ford 
and Chrysler over the past year, the answer is clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Value pricing is mostly responsible," said Ann Pattyn, who orchestrates the 
GM program from its regional headquarters in Thousand Oaks, the company's nerve 
center for its Southern California dealer network and sales strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 To GM, value pricing means limiting option packages to just one or two 
combinations for each vehicle, and selling at discounted sticker prices that, 
in theory, are not negotiable. Through value pricing, GM undercuts the 
competition on similarly equipped cars. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, GM's Pontiac Grand Am SE comes with an air bag, a stereo, air 
conditioning and other options for a no-dicker price of $13,995. A comparably 
equipped Toyota Camry DX, GM said, is listed at $20,822. Similarly, a 
value-priced Chevrolet Lumina is $3,000 less than a comparably equipped Ford 
Taurus GL. The aim of value pricing, Pattyn said, is to simplify car shopping 
and eliminate the haggling that makes car buying so unsavory. 
</P>
<P>
 But some GM dealers say the introduction of popular new designs, such as the 
Pontiac Firebird, and vastly improved quality ratings of GM cars have had much 
more to do with enhanced sales than value pricing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Livingston Motor Car Co., a Buick and Pontiac dealership in Woodland Hills, 
sales have surged by 16% over the past model year. But sales manager Terry 
Billingsley said to attribute that increase to value pricing "is a real 
stretch." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, many GM dealers say they have been hurt by value pricing because it 
boosts GM's profits at their expense. Gil Schneider, who operates GM 
dealerships in Van Nuys, said sales of Oldsmobiles and Buicks are up 9% this 
model year, thanks largely to value pricing, but his profit per vehicle is $200 
less. "If I could triple my volume, I could make it that way," Schneider said. 
"But GM isn't in a position to triple my volume." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, GM is clearly smitten with the program because it helps do away 
with rebates, financing incentives and other costly promotions. Also, offering 
just a few option packages on most vehicles simplifies GM's production process 
and boosts GM's profits by forcing consumers to buy cars loaded with more 
features than they might otherwise choose. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 12 months since the program was launched in August of 1993, GM has sold 
232,093 vehicles in California, 38,288 more than a year earlier. And though 
less than half of GM's 1994 models were value priced, they accounted for more 
than 70% of sales. 
</P>
<P>
 GM considers the program such a huge success that the company is expanding it. 
In 1995, the number of value-priced models will be increased to 70 from 46, and 
Pattyn said she expects those vehicles to account for up to 85% of sales. And 
though value pricing has until now been largely a California experiment, the 
company is slowly moving to expand it nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Value pricing has boosted sales of certain GM models, Billingsley said, but 
not others. Sales at his Woodland Hills dealership of the Buick Regal have more 
than tripled to 15 a month since the car was value priced, for example, but 
sales of the Buick LeSabre are unchanged at 12 per month. Both cars are luxury 
sedans, but unlike the Regal, the LeSabre lacked leather seats, a keyless entry 
system, a power antenna and a few other features. Despite these shortcomings, 
the LeSabre's sticker price was $1,500 higher than the Regal's. 
</P>
<P>
 GM has squeezed dealer margins by lowering suggested prices for consumers, 
while often raising the price dealers pay the factory. At Livingston, for 
example, a well-equipped 1994 LeSabre lists for $20,195, about $300 below the 
1993 sticker price before value pricing was instituted. Meanwhile, the 
wholesale price Livingston pays GM has gone up by about $1,350, Billingsley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealers also complained that even though value pricing is supposed to mean no 
price dickering with customers, competition among GM dealers is so fierce that 
they often feel compelled to sell below the sticker price. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers rarely pay sticker prices anyway, said James Bragg, who operates the 
Fighting Chance consumer information service in Long Beach, so GM "reducing" 
the sticker price doesn't necessarily mean consumers are paying less. Bragg 
also complained that GM is using value pricing to attract buyers to 
slow-selling models, while some of GM's most sought-after vehicles -- including 
the Chevrolet Camaro, the Oldsmobile Aurora and the newly designed Chevrolet 
Blazer -- are conspicuously missing from the value-priced list. 
</P>
<P>
 "If value pricing is good for everyone, then why doesn't GM put it on the cars 
that people really want to buy?" said Bragg, who offered another question: "How 
come no one else is rushing to follow GM into value-pricing land?" 
</P>
<P>
 The simple answer, analysts say, is they don't need to. Chrysler, which has 
enjoyed brisk sales in recent years, has all but sworn it won't engage in value 
pricing. And Ford employs the strategy on only a handful of its models. "We 
only really do that where we see a situation where the segment has shrunk, or 
there is a value problem," said Keith Magee, general manager of Ford's 
Lincoln-Mercury division. 
</P>
<P>
 That's fine with GM, which wouldn't mind cornering the value-pricing market. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (strategy) was perceived as high risk in the beginning," Pattyn said. 
But now, for the first time in years, GM is talking about its once-soaring 
market share not as a painful memory, but as a realistic long-term goal. "It's 
possible," Pattyn said.

LIFE AFTER DEFENSE; MORE THAN 50 FIRMS CLAMOR TO USE PART OF ROCKETDYNE SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Can an old government nuclear site find new life in commercial markets? In the 
rocky hills above Simi Valley, Rocketdyne and federal energy officials are 
trying to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Technology Engineering Center, or ETEC, 
is 100 acres of weeds, dirt roads and sweeping, smog-free views in the Santa 
Susana Mountains. Surrounded by barbed-wire fences and blue-clad guards, ETEC 
has been cloaked in anonymity for most of its long history; it used to be a 
testing site for parts for nuclear power plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with budget cuts, ETEC, which is managed by the Canoga Park Rocketdyne 
unit of Rockwell International, has been forced to open its doors to 
entrepreneurs. More than 50 such firms have contacted ETEC asking for the use 
of everything from its 70-megawatt natural-gas-powered steam generator, to 
powerful machines that simulate earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the interest comes from firms that want to test and demonstrate new 
inventions before taking them to market. Among the new start-up firms that have 
signed agreements with ETEC is MKE Inc., a tiny company owned by a retired 
utility engineer and his wife who run the business from their home in Upper St. 
Clair, Pa. They want to test a super-efficient, non-polluting industrial 
furnace.  
</P>
<P>
 Another is Hydrogen Burner Technology Inc., a group of six professionals in 
Costa Mesa who say they can overhaul a conventional motor so that a car would 
convert some gas into usuable hydrogen fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, the number of companies interested in getting a piece of ETEC 
bodes well for the site's future, proponents say. Manny Tessier, manager of 
quality assurance and training at the site, believes that ETEC, unlike so many 
other relics of the cold war defense buildup, will make a successful shift from 
government contracts to commercial business. "We are getting calls every day," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But ETEC has a way to go before it's likely to replace the fat government 
contracts that once kept about 350 people employed. Today, only 140 Rocketdyne 
scientists, engineers and technicians work there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Energy Department's funding for ETEC, which costs about $25 million a year 
to operate, was scheduled to end in 1993 with the shelving of the government's 
fast-breeder nuclear reactor program. But local politicians, government 
agencies and community groups, including the Valley Industry and Commerce 
Assn., successfully persuaded federal officials to continue funding ETEC 
through 1995 to help the site become an industrial technology incubator. 
</P>
<P>
 The highly specialized equipment at ETEC is not something to discard lightly, 
say its defenders. "It would be a shame if the kinds of facilities located at 
ETEC fell into a state of disrepair or were not available for use. They are a 
real resource," said Tom Tobin, executive director of the state Seismic Safety 
Commission. Tobin said there are only a handful of sites in the state that have 
earthquake shaking tables similar to those at ETEC. 
</P>
<P>
 A community task force called the Community Reuse Organization has been 
working to market the site. So far, interest runs high, but actual revenue 
generated has been modest. About $2.5 million in the fiscal 1995 budget will 
come from new sources, including research agreements with five private 
companies, said ETEC site manager Robert Le Chevalier. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Energy and the task force are also looking into possible 
contracts to allow companies to lease parts of the site, and they have begun a 
series of public workshops there. 
</P>
<P>
 But Le Chevalier said the real changes are still to come. Ten more research 
agreements with private companies may be signed within the year. One pending 
agreement involves a mirror-decked solar collector used for experiments more 
than a decade ago, which may be refurbished to produce hydrogen fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 And energy officials are negotiating with Exergy Inc. of Hayward to help build 
a $90-million full-scale demonstration power plant based on the company's new 
technology, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glimpse, ETEC, which is part of Rocketdyne's 2,700-acre Santa Susana 
Testing Facility, seems an unlikely spot for a new generation of commercial 
technology. The cluster of modular office buildings on the site have the drab 
paint and narrow hallways so characteristic of Southern California's outmoded 
defense facilities.  
</P>
<P>
 Much of the rest of the site is vacant land. Visitors who stray far from the 
buildings are warned to watch for snakes. 
</P>
<P>
 For a short period during the 1950s, ETEC was home to a nuclear testing 
program for space propulsion and power plants. A small nuclear reactor on the 
site once provided electricity for the city of Moorpark, but the nuclear 
program was deemed impractical as more people moved into surrounding areas, 
Tessier said. Today, all that's left of the reactor is the barn-like structure 
in which it is housed. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Department of Energy hopes to complete cleanup by 1997 of residual 
radioactive waste on the site left from these programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the steam generator, ETEC has machines called shaking tables that 
replicate earthquakes. Other facilities were designed to subject parts to 
friction, wear and sudden temperature changes, which can break faulty pipes 
much as a cold glass will shatter when filled with boiling water. 
</P>
<P>
 One large structure holds a snarl of twisting pipes, six stories high, 
suspended like sausages. The structure is designed to accommodate sudden 
temperature changes, which cause pipes to expand and contract and rip loose 
from ordinary bolts, explained John Boggio, who manages the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The replacement value of all this elaborate hardware is estimated at $500 
million, much less than other Energy Department national laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
 The site could become "a model of a commercial-defense technology incubator," 
said Rohit Shukla, executive director of the Los Angeles Regional Technology 
Alliance and a member of the Community Reuse Organization. "We have put a lot 
of investment into defense, and it's about time we see it come back to us in 
our daily lives." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a view shared by the companies that have successfully taken advantage 
of ETEC's availability. Their new agreements with ETEC provide for the use of 
equipment, power and metallurgy laboratories there and allow them to benefit 
from the skills of Rocketdyne engineers and technicians at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first companies to use the site was Exergy Inc., owned by Alexander 
Kalina, a Russian-born inventor who signed an agreement with ETEC in 1987. 
Kalina has since successfully demonstrated his idea for power generation based 
on the so-called "Kalina cycle," which increases power plant efficiency.  
</P>
<P>
 The Kalina Cycle employs ammonia and water, which produce steam, and special 
processes for condensing steam and recovering waste heat. Exergy has invested 
$14 million in its small-scale demonstration plant at ETEC, said Hank 
Leibowitz, vice president of engineering for Exergy Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Newer projects at ETEC include testing of building parts for earthquake safety 
for the state Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway 
Administration. There is also a pending agreement with Clean Air Now, a 
nonprofit environmental group, and Xerox Corp. to test hydrogen-powered 
vehicles and filling stations.  
</P>
<P>
 Paul Staples, executive director of Clean Air Now, said the technology has 
been developed, but "we need to get real data, have real-life demonstrations. . 
. . ETEC plays a very critical part."

REGIONAL EARNINGS: HARMONY HOLDINGS REPORTS 4TH QUARTER TURNAROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harmony Holdings Inc., a Burbank producer of television commercials and 
videos, said its profit in the fiscal fourth quarter that ended June 30 was 
$292,000, compared to a loss of $1.7 million in the fourth quarter last 
year.The turnaround was on revenue of $9.7 million, up 33% from $7.3 million 
the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fiscal year, Harmony Holdings narrowed its loss to $1.57 million, from 
$3.21 million last year. Revenues for the year grew 68% to $41.7 million from 
$24.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company attributed the results for the year to increased business at all 
of its four operating subsidiaries, and to internal restructuring which has cut 
overhead costs.

LOCAL STOCKS MAKE MODEST REBOUND IN 3RD QUARTER; MARKETS: SOME 58% OF REGIONAL 
ISSUES POST GAINS IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPT. 30, MIRRORING THE NATIONAL 
MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Local stocks staged a modest turnaround in the third quarter, as 58% of the 
stocks showed gains in value. This was an improvement over the first and second 
quarters of 1994, when three in five local stocks suffered a loss in value. 
</P>
<P>
 On average, area stocks increased 6% in value in the three months ended Sept. 
30, roughly mirroring gains seen in larger markets. The NASDAQ Composite Index 
of about 4,000 mostly small company stocks rose 8% in the third quarter. The 
Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 blue-chip stocks grew 6%, while the broader 
S&P 500 Index increased 4% in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, those stocks faring the best included a producer of television 
infomercials, a provider of payroll processing services and a maker of bar-code 
labeling products, which were rewarded for solid earnings growth. They were 
among the 105 stocks based in the San Fernando Valley, Antelope Valley and 
Ventura County whose performance was tracked in the third quarter by Media 
General Financial Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Of these local firms, Positive Response Television Inc. in Sherman Oaks showed 
the biggest gain, with its stock nearly tripling to $15.75 a share from $5.75 
at the end of the second quarter. The company went public in May in one of the 
year's hottest new stock offerings, raising $6 million to help pay for its 
expansion. It also recently sold 400,000 new shares of its common stock to an 
investment group for $12.50 each, with the $5 million raised to be used to 
increase air time for existing infomercials and for new infomercials. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three months ended June 30, Positive Response's profit fell 67% due to 
earthquake damage that delayed production. But for the six months ended June 
30, its earnings grew 53%, to $336,000, from $220,000 a year earlier, while its 
revenue surged fivefold, to $6.55 million from $1.28 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Levey, Positive Response chairman and chief executive, said investors are 
responding to the company's financial performance and growth prospects. "One of 
the reasons Positive Response is so successful is our extreme visibility. About 
85 million viewers see our shows every month." 
</P>
<P>
 Levey added that as new cable stations open up and venues such as computer 
networks open to advertising, this technology will fuel the growth of the 
infomercial industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Another big gainer for the quarter was Pay-Fone Systems Inc. in Van Nuys, 
which provides automated payroll processing services. Its stock rose to $4.44 a 
share in the third quarter from $2.25 three months earlier. The company 
recently reported a $21,526 profit for its fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30, 
following a year-earlier loss of $49,720, while its revenue rose 8% to $1.09 
million. Pay-Fone attributed the revenue and earnings growth largely to its 
February acquisition of Concentric Computer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth-based Eltron International Inc., a maker of bar-code label printers 
and software, saw its stock nearly double to $15 a share from $8.25. Eltron's 
initial public stock offering in February was also one of the best received 
initial public offerings this year. It went public at $6 per share, raising 
$6.6 million to buy equipment and repay debt. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second quarter ended June 30, Eltron's earnings rose nearly sixfold, 
to $598,110 from $103,929 a year earlier, while its sales tripled to $3.87 
million from $1.29 million. Also, last spring it received a $2.6-million 
printer order from United Parcel Service. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brisk sales of automotive products helped Special Devices Inc. in Newhall to 
more than double its earnings in its fiscal third quarter ended July 31, to 
$858,000 from $376,000 a year earlier, while its sales grew 81% to $17.1 
million. As of Sept. 30, the company's stock had gained 59%, to $14.81 from 
$9.34 on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Special Devices, which makes devices used in defense and automotive 
industries, also recently announced that it was expanding its Arizona 
facilities to accommodate increased demand for its products. In July it also 
agreed to acquire a Chicago company that makes aircraft-crew escape components 
and life support equipment, thus expanding its customer base in the aerospace 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Two small high-tech companies also saw sizable gains in the third quarter--MRV 
Communications Inc. in Chatsworth and Calabasas-based Tekelec. Semiconductor 
maker MRV had record earnings and revenue in the second quarter ended June 30. 
Tekelec, a supplier of communications diagnostic and switching systems, turned 
around a year-earlier loss with an $877,000 profit in the second quarter ended 
June 30. Last month it announced that AT&T would distribute its telephone 
switching equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the poorest performances among local stocks in the third quarter was by 
troubled apparel maker Cherokee Inc. in Sunland. The company has continued to 
suffer financial woes--stemming largely from its heavy debt--since emerging 
from bankruptcy reorganization last year. In the year ended May 28, Cherokee 
lost $24.8 million on $114.1 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite scrapping certain clothing lines and refocusing on casual wear, 
investors apparently view Cherokee's prospects as bleak. Its stock plunged 78% 
in the third quarter, to 25 cents a share from $1.13. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley-based Golden Systems Inc., a producer of power-switching devices 
for computers, saw its stock plunge by more than half, to $1.53 a share from 
$3.50. Last month, the company said it expected to report a loss of between $1 
million and $1.5 million for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, while sales 
would remain flat at about $9.9 million. It blamed the anticipated loss on 
fewer orders from its largest customer, Compaq Computer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 An expected loss also sent the stock of Pollution Research and Control Corp. 
tumbling. The Glendale maker of pollution-monitoring instruments finished the 
third quarter at 75 cents a share, compared to $1.31 on June 30, after 
announcing last month that fierce pricing competition and a drop in orders 
would result in a loss for the three months ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Another big loser for the quarter was struggling House of Fabric Inc., the 
Sherman Oaks fabrics retailer. The company has suffered since 1992, when the 
recession hurt its sales. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, it said it would close 200 of its 624 stores by Jan. 31 and 
reported an $11.6-million loss for its fiscal second quarter ended July 31, on 
a 15% decline in revenue to $110 million. 
</P>
<P>
 House of Fabrics is pinning its hopes on a new strategy to expand its fabric 
stores to include more crafts and home decorating items. 
</P>
<P>
 But the financial community remains skeptical. The company's stock fell 41% in 
the third quarter, to $2 a share from $3.38. 10 Biggest Regional Stock Winners

 For years, Kinko's Service Corp. has been known as the photocopy place. 
Legions of college students have been weaned on the nationwide chain's 24-hour 
service, the salvation of many a last-minute term paper. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the late 1980s, to keep up with new office equipment technology, 
Kinko's decided it had to join the information age. So the Ventura company 
installed Apple Macintosh computers for customers to use in its stores, 
alongside its longtime staples -- copying documents, self-service copying and 
passport photo services. Over the next several years, it added fax machines, 
IBM personal computers, large-format document copying, posters and color 
copiers. 
</P>
<P>
 And in April, Kinko's jumped on the information superhighway. About 100 of its 
725 stores now offer video conferencing rooms, with the ability to link video 
and voice signals over phone lines with other locations. The next step Kinko's 
foresees is giving customers the ability to communicate with stores 
electronically, so they may order copies via their home or office computer in 
Los Angeles, for instance, to be distributed in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's hopes to move away from the image that's stuck with it since it was 
founded 24 years ago: that of a photocopy store catering primarily to college 
students. While Kinko's still serves the college market, more than anything it 
wants to be known as the "branch office" for entrepreneurs, telecommuters, 
traveling business people and local representatives of corporations based 
elsewhere. It also wants to lure more consumers who will use Kinko's for 
personal tasks, such as creating custom party invitations, enlarging photos and 
mounting them and mailing and delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the new services, however, Kinko's runs a couple of risks. Its strategy 
requires investing heavily in sometimes expensive technology -- just one color 
copier, for example, costs about $50,000 -- and continuing to invest as 
technology improves. The trick is to avoid relying on technologies that have 
become commonplace, like fax machines, but at the same time to avoid rushing 
ahead with something that consumers might not be ready for. 
</P>
<P>
 "All technology takes a burn-in period," said Kinko's President Dan 
Frederickson. Kinko's expects to invest $20 million in its video conferencing 
venture and, he said, "The gamble is whether the timing is right or not." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Frederickson knows well that Kinko's has another problem: 
Many potential customers just don't seem to know about all the new services. 
"As long as we hear customers say, 'I didn't know you could do that,' we've got 
a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Frederickson plans to install video conferencing centers in more -- though not 
necessarily all -- Kinko's outlets. The service is set up in a conference room 
equipped with a large-screen television monitor with a camera on top and a 
device that resembles an oversized TV remote control. A video conference 
doesn't come cheap -- $150 per site, per hour -- but Frederickson calls it a 
bargain compared with the cost of air fare, hotel rooms and other travel 
expenses. Besides business people, he sees the service appealing to families 
for video "reunions" and other special occasions, and the company is offering a 
half-price holiday promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's joint venture partner on the video conferencing project is U.S. 
Sprint, which provides the phone lines and a toll-free number to set up a 
conference. Randy Doyle, Kinko's product manager, said he's now looking into 
adding PCs to the system so participants in a conference can share and 
manipulate data and graphics during the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, local Kinko's stores that have the equipment installed have found it 
slow going. The manager at the Kinko's store in Ventura reported averaging six 
or seven video conferences a week; managers at the Encino and North Hills shops 
say they see only one or two a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest problem is, people just don't know about it," said Kinko's Encino 
manager Robert Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's is the first in its industry to offer video conferencing, and Bob 
Hall, executive editor of Quick Printing magazine in Port St. Lucie, Fla., 
questions whether many customers will want the technology. "Somebody would have 
to show me where they're going to make money at that." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Lowe, president of a Kinko's rival, Sir Speedy, a chain of 880 
quick-printing and copy centers, based in Laguna Hills, said that investing in 
technology is "a requirement today." Sir Speedy already offers electronic links 
to many of its customers, a service that is increasingly in demand because it's 
convenient and saves customers time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowe, however, said he decided to pass on video teleconferencing. He felt the 
technology was not yet sophisticated enough, and "by the time it is perfect, 
AT&T will have those units in every office in the country and most hotels will 
have it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lowe and others suggest that Kinko's might do better to expand into offset 
printing -- which rivals such as PIP Printing and Sir Speedy offer -- because 
of growing corporate demand for quick-turnaround print jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ten thousand envelopes and letters can be significant bread-and-butter" 
business, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The entire quick-printing industry, as it's called, includes 35,000 printing 
and photocopying stores nationwide, ranging from those of large franchised 
chains like Agoura Hills-based PIP, to small mom-and-pop shops. But in the past 
five years the industry has matured to the point where it's now consolidating; 
in 1993, PIP closed or chose not to renew franchises on 103 shops, according to 
Quick Printing magazine. But generally the large chains like Kinko's are better 
positioned to survive the ongoing industry shakeout and invest in the new 
services that customers want, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's already enjoys some clear advantages because of its size, said Hall, 
including the ability to cut favorable deals with equipment suppliers like 
Xerox and Canon.  
</P>
<P>
 It also helps that about 100 stores are owned solely by Kinko's reclusive 
founder and chairman, Paul Orfalea, and the rest are co-owned in partnerships 
by Orfalea and other investors. Orfalea, who declined to be interviewed, also 
owns Kinko's Financial Services, an internal financing unit. This common 
ownership gives the company a strength of management, Hall believes, that 
franchised networks have difficulty achieving. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the new services, Kinko's has an aggressive growth plan calling 
for another 150 stores to open in 1995. It's also pushing into foreign markets 
like Japan, where it is opening its third Kinko's in a joint venture with the 
huge Japanese concern Sumitomo. Several stores are being planned for Canada. It 
has one store in Holland and hopes to add more in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Company executives won't disclose revenues or profits. But a Dun & Bradstreet 
report put 1992 sales of the 81 Kinko's stores then owned solely by Orfalea at 
$80.9 million. The report said that 95% of sales came from photocopying and 
duplicating services, unlike rivals such as PIP and Sir Speedy, where offset 
printing services also make up a large share of sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Greif, president of Greif & Co., a Los Angeles investment banking firm, 
estimated that Kinko's sales average about $700,000 per store and that total 
revenues for all the Kinko's stores is about $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Kinko's are probably "nicely profitable" and acts quickly to shut down 
money-losing stores. Kinko's management is "held in high esteem in the 
industry. They're tight operators. They're also more of a competitive threat to 
a lot of other players in the industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Greif said Kinko's is entering a more demanding marketplace with its branch 
office concept and its effort to grab more business customers. It's a tough 
call, Frederickson admitted, to balance the several hundred thousand dollars 
needed to open a new store against the expense of keeping existing stores 
stocked in new equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that the training Kinko's 17,000 employees must undergo to learn to use 
the machines and to be more helpful in counseling business clients. "I think 
this technology is going to change really fast, and there are costs associated 
with that," Frederickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the investments needed, Frederickson said that selling stock to the 
public isn't in the company's current plans -- as has been rumored -- although 
he won't rule it out for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the kind of decision that might have seemed inconceivable in 1970, when 
Orfalea, now 47, started selling school supplies to UC Santa Barbara students. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Kinko's shop in Isla Vista, named after the wiry texture of 
Orfalea's hair, was so small that the copy machine was wheeled out on the 
sidewalk to make room inside for customers. The business took off, however, and 
Orfalea added more stores. In 1988, he moved the corporate headquarters to 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, a big part of Kinko's business was still copying portions of 
textbooks for college students and professors. But a 1989 lawsuit by a group of 
textbook publishers -- which Kinko's lost -- put it out of that line of work. 
Frederickson said that losing the case was more coincidental to Kinko's 
decision to change its focus away from students and that the company was 
already well along in implementing its broader strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Kinko's has made Orfalea a wealthy man. In addition to his 
Kinko's holdings, he owns stakes in about two dozen small retail and apartment 
buildings throughout the state and a $1.4-million Santa Barbara home. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Orfalea avoids the spotlight, Frederickson said the Kinko's founder is 
still very much involved with store operations, new products and strategy. But 
Orfalea shuns industry gatherings, Hall said, and after several past attempts 
to elicit his cooperation has only this year agreed to Quick Printing 
magazine's naming him its "man of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Orfalea's shyness has reflected itself in Kinko's low profile. But if Kinko's 
is to succeed in the information highway age, Hall said, that will have to 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to have to get the word out," he said. "It's great to have all 
these capabilities, but they don't do any good unless your customers want 
them."

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: ARRIVAL OF '95 CARS TO DRIVE UP ACTIVITY AT PORT OF 
HUENEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The unveiling of the new 1995 model year autos means activity is about to heat 
up at Ventura County's fast-growing deep-water harbor, the Port of Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next several months, thousands of Volvos, BMWs, Jaguars, Mazdas, 
Mitsubishis and Land Rovers will be passing through the small facility in Port 
Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 The cars will be driven to nearby processing centers, where they'll be 
inspected and equipped with radios and other accessories. Then they'll be 
delivered to dealerships throughout the Western United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new models have already started to arrive," reported Kam Quarles, special 
assistant to port Executive Director Anthony Taormina. "We expect more and more 
of them between now and the end of the year." The imports will probably 
continue at peak levels through February, Quarles adds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, Japan's Mitsubishi joined the overseas manufacturers using 
Hueneme. Volvo, Jaguar and Land Rover began using the facility two years ago. 
All four are processed by Pacific Vehicle Processors Inc., an Oxnard firm 
that's owned by Stockholm-based Wallenius Lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarles said foreign auto makers have chosen the Ventura County port over its 
larger counterparts in Los Angeles and Long Beach for several reasons. "We now 
have three processing centers within a mile or so of our harbor. And there's 
land available here for companies that want to set up new centers." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he noted, Ventura County's lighter highway traffic makes it 
easier for auto-hauling trucks to get in and out of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 In fiscal 1994, which ended June 30, about 110,000 foreign cars were imported 
through the Port of Hueneme, 6% more than in fiscal 1993. Despite the 
recession, fiscal '93 volume was up 2% over fiscal '92. Port authorities expect 
further improvement this year. Autos, in fact, have joined citrus exports and 
banana imports as the key products passing through the port. 
</P>
<P>
 On the downside, the importing of Australian beef, once considered a bright 
prospect for the port, didn't materialize. Most of that shipping has gone to 
the East Coast, Quarles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Port of Hueneme handled 634,000 tons of shipping in fiscal 1994, up 
nearly 50% from the previous year's 424,000 tons. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, the port's operator, the Oxnard Harbor District, estimated 
that the facility was responsible for 2,000 jobs and $200 million in business 
in Ventura County. A new report shows considerable increases in both 
categories, Quarles said.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: SCAG SAYS AIRPORT WON'T EXCEED POLLUTION LIMITS

 The proposal to create a regional airport at the Navy's Point Mugu base is 
taxiing toward further hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California Assn. of Governments says a commercial airport at the 
base could accommodate 2 million passengers a year without exceeding air 
pollution rules. At first, SCAG's experts said the proposed facility would 
violate the rules, but then the projected passenger load was reduced from an 
earlier estimate of 2.5 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet to be heard from are the County Board of Supervisors and a Joint Use 
Investigative Committee. The Navy, too, must take an official stand. And the 
issue could be further clouded if the Clinton Administration decides to include 
Mugu on its base-closure list.DEFENSE CONVERSION

OPTIMA HEALTH PLAN OK AWAITED; MEDICINE: AGENCY TODAY WILL SELECT WHAT APPROACH 
IT WILL TAKE IN CREATING MEDI-CAL SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County today is expected to adopt a one-of-a kind system for providing 
health care to its 300,000 Medi-Cal recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 OPTIMA, the organization creating a new managed-care system for Medi-Cal 
patients in the county, is trying to curb Medi-Cal's burgeoning cost in part by 
shifting indigents away from expensive hospital emergency rooms to an expanded 
pool of doctors close to their homes who can offer regular health care. 
</P>
<P>
 When directors of OPTIMA meet today to select a plan for the new system, they 
will have several options. But the agency's consultant has given the highest 
marks to a plan that would allow the agency to contract with both existing 
health maintenance organizations and new alliances of independent doctors, 
clinics and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's decision will be "a major turning point in the development of the 
system," said Samuel Roth, assistant director of the Orange County Medical 
Assn. "It will go a long way to determining how providers wishing to contract 
with OPTIMA will be required to organize themselves and with whom they will be 
required to organize." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County follows two other counties, Santa Barbara and San Mateo, which 
more than a decade ago assumed from the state the responsibility for providing 
Medi-Cal services. In addition, Solano County established its own Medi-Cal 
system in April and Santa Cruz County, like Orange County, will begin patient 
enrollment in July. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the early county-based Medi-Cal programs founded in Monterey County 
went bankrupt; state officials said it was the result of poor management, 
including overgenerous payment of hospitals and physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 But with an estimated 300,000 patients to serve and an annual budget of up to 
$600,000, OPTIMA will be the largest of its kind in the nation. Moreover, 
"OPTIMA will be the biggest health plan by far in Orange County, bigger than 
Kaiser," said John R. Cochran III, chief executive officer of Martin Luther 
Hospital in Anaheim and OPTIMA's board chairman.  
</P>
<P>
 Only a small number of Orange County physicians accept patients covered by 
Medi-Cal, which has been criticized for low reimbursement and red tape.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In demonstrating the urgency to improve access to health care in Orange 
County, OPTIMA consultant Cindy Johnson has said that only 50% of Medi-Cal 
recipients on Aid to Families with Dependent Children in the county receive any 
medical services in a given year, compared to about 85% on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Since OPTIMA was formed last year by the Orange County Board of Supervisors, 
many doctors and hospitals have been waiting to learn how they can participate 
in the new program.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the switch from fee-for-service to a prepaid managed health system is 
not expected to be any more lucrative for doctors and hospitals, the hope is 
that because OPTIMA will be administered locally, it will be more hassle-free 
and responsive to area needs than the state-administered Medi-Cal program.  
</P>
<P>
 "Many providers show support for anything that will alleviate the built-in 
denials and retroactive denials of the system driven out of Sacramento," Roth 
said. "It is half the battle when you alleviate the hassle associated with 
trying to provide quality medical care." 
</P>
<P>
 OPTIMA board members face four choices today, including one that would have 
all Medi-Cal patients enroll in health maintenance organizations or in the few 
physician groups that already have created a full range of integrated medical 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Consultants have determined HMOs would save the state the most money because 
they have experience controlling the use of services and would not require 
OPTIMA to act as a gatekeeper to prevent excessive patient referrals to 
specialists and excessively long hospital stays. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is widespread fear, especially in Latino and Asian communities, that 
exclusive contracting with HMOs would squeeze out the independent physicians, 
clinics and pharmacies that traditionally have served neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greatest fear we have in the Asian community is that foreign-born doctors 
who currently are serving the Asian medical population will lose their 
clientele," said Alan Woo, president of the Asian Pacific Health Alliance, a 
group of health-care advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our physicians will not have a say within traditional HMOs, because that 
environment is western based with an Anglo philosophy that has traditionally 
discriminated against non-English-speaking doctors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, OPTIMA's Executive Director Mary Dewane was guided through Little 
Saigon's clinics and pharmacies by Westminster Councilman Tony Lam, who said he 
wanted to show her that Vietnamese physicians are doing a fine job taking care 
of that population. 
</P>
<P>
 Lam said he wishes OPTIMA would model itself after the Medi-Cal plans of Santa 
Barbara and San Mateo, which will contract with solo practitioners and 
stand-alone clinics. This option is also before the OPTIMA board. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Vietnamese physicians and pharmacists don't want to be sucked into a big 
company . . . with high overhead and bureaucracy," Lam said. "I am an advocate 
of saving money for the state, but I don't want the big companies to take 
advantage of and eat up the smaller ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns for self-preservation also have been expressed by the executive 
director of the Orange County Coalition of Community Clinics. Russell Inglish 
said he worries that if Medi-Cal patients and thus Medi-Cal funding is siphoned 
from the clinics, they may not be able to survive to care for the county's poor 
who have no health insurance at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Foley, executive vice president of the Hospital Council of Southern 
California and the head of its Orange County chapter, also said his 
organization wants to make certain the three hospitals in the county that have 
treated an exceptionally large number of Medi-Cal patients -- UCI Medical 
Center, Children's Hospital of Orange County and Doctors Hospital of Santa Ana 
-- will not suffer significant losses of patients under OPTIMA. 
</P>
<P>
 It is generally agreed that traditional Medi-Cal providers should be retained 
in case OPTIMA fails. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it fails, we must make sure the safety net is still in place," said Roth 
of the Orange County Medical Assn. "These are the people who stayed in the 
trenches for the last 20 years taking care of the medically indigent in Orange 
County when few others would." 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing this concern, OPTIMA developed the "hybrid" plan, which would 
permit private physicians, clinics and hospitals to form consortiums as an 
alternative to joining HMOs. Like HMOs, these consortiums would be required to 
provide a wide range of specialty and ancillary services, possibly even 
including laboratory tests and X-rays, along with a system to guard against 
over-utilization and ensure quality of care. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the consortiums would bear the full financial risk of providing care 
within the flat monthly rate that OPTIMA would pay them depending on the 
number, age and sex of the patients they enroll. But consortiums, unlike HMOs, 
would not have to go through the lengthy and expensive process of obtaining a 
state license. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is so unique that I don't know of anyplace else in the country that is 
doing it," Dewane said of the consortium approach. "It allows for greater 
access into the system and greater control on the part of traditional and solo 
practitioners than if they had to align with an existing HMO or fully 
integrated network." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Dr. Robert R. Beltran, an ear, nose and throat specialist in Costa Mesa, 
predicted independent physicians and hospitals will have difficulty forming 
consortiums by next spring when OPTIMA health care providers will be selected. 
Thus he predicts that HMOs will quickly corner the patient market. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a slam-dunk situation for the HMOs," Beltran said, voicing a fear also 
expressed by other physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dewane, who in the past six weeks has visited 15 hospitals and met with 
more than 700 physicians to explain what OPTIMA is all about, strongly 
disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran said that to allow physicians and hospitals to contract individually 
with OPTIMA would erode the advantages of having a kind of one-stop medical 
service that can put a patient in touch with any level of care that is needed. 
He said many physicians already have organized into groups capable of 
contracting with OPTIMA and many others are doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dream the OPTIMA board has is that the providers will organize the system 
so patients don't have to go hunting anymore," Cochran said.

 Contracts and grants passed the $100-million mark for the third year in a row, 
UCI spokeswoman Karen Newell Young said. Research grants have increased at the 
university since the 1986-87 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are pretty positive about these numbers," Young said. "They've shown a 
steady improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Grants from federal, state, local and private sources in fiscal year 1993-94 
totaled $107,204,452 -- a 3% increase from the previous year, Young said. They 
paid for research into a variety of disciplines, from searching for the roots 
of Alzheimer's disease to providing better child care for infants and toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Michael E. Selsted is UCI's research cleanup hitter, university statistics 
show: He got more than $10.7 million in grants during the 1993-94 fiscal year. 
The next highest ranking scientist, physics Professor Henry Sobel, attracted 
$2.8 million in grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Selsted studies innate immunity and is examining the ability of human beings 
to fend off microorganisms with small antibiotic-like molecules made in white 
blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
 The College of Medicine was the largest money-getter, Young said, drawing 
$49.8 million -- more than 46% of the total contracts and grants.  
</P>
<P>
 UCI's future success depends on increasing research in engineering and 
biological, physical and social sciences, among other areas, Chancellor Laurel 
L. Wilkening said. In a recent statement, Wilkening called for UCI to penetrate 
the tier of the top 50 research universities in the country by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of UCI's contracts came from federal agencies, which contributed $74.3 
million, or about 69% of the total. State contracts and grants dropped 78% over 
the previous year, to a total of about $2 million, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time research grants grew, private donors contributed less to 
UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of private gifts in 1993-94 decreased by 17% compared to the 
previous year -- mostly because there were few large donations, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 James Asp, acting vice chancellor of university advancement, said UCI received 
one donation over $1 million in 1993-94, compared to six donations in the 
$1-million to $5-million range in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 Asp said he was not surprised about the drop, and added that the number of 
people and organizations that donated money grew by about 4%.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm optimistic," Asp said. "With the new sense of direction from the 
chancellor and the economy coming back, I'm hopeful we'll have a good year." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, fund-raisers will focus on health sciences and other disciplines 
that are UCI's strengths, he said. Officials will try to solicit money from 
foundations and people who are prominent in those fields. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a recent dinner raised money for the university's cancer 
programs, Asp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the downturn in private giving, UCI will continue its efforts in that 
area, Asp said. "Private support is going to be increasingly important as the 
state's support for UC shrinks," he said. UCI Funding 
</P>
<P>
 Private monetary gifts to UC Irvine hit a six-year low during the past year, 
but contracts and grants from private, local, state and federal sources set a 
university record. Dollar amounts in millions per fiscal year:

 Private gifts: '93-'94: $20.6

VIETNAM DELEGATION OPTIMISTIC; TRADE: ORANGE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES SEE BRIGHT 
PROSPECTS FOR BUSINESS IN COMMUNIST NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Newly arrived to this communist country, an American trade delegation 
including Orange County Vietnamese expatriates is finding signs of budding 
capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen of the Americans on Monday were surprised by an aggressive 
street vendor who thrust a T-shirt through an open window of their parked van. 
But before the vendor could complete the deal, the van sped away. Determined to 
make a sale, the Vietnamese woman hopped on a nearby motorbike and tailed the 
van about two miles back to the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 She closed the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wouldn't you like to have a sales force like that?" said Richard Elliott, 54, 
a regional director of Sherwin-Williams, the paint manufacturer. "I am amazed 
by the people here. They are always working and very resourceful." 
</P>
<P>
 In their first full day in Vietnam, most of the 24 American delegates 
expressed optimism about the business prospects in Vietnam. On Monday, the 
group met with high-ranking leaders of government and business who may soon 
become willing partners in helping American businesses ease into the Vietnamese 
marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope the presence of all of us here will build a bridge between the U.S. 
and Vietnam," said Co Pham, president of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the group is scheduled to meet with Vietnamese Vice President Nguyen Thi 
Binh. And on Thursday the group will travel to Ho Chi Minh City for another 
round of meetings with business and government heads. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Pham, two other Orange County delegates have emerged as the 
group heavyweights -- Kenneth Moore, president of Orange County Chamber of 
Commerce, and Dunson Cheng, chairman of Cathay Bank. Cheng, head of Little 
Saigon's largest Asian-American-run bank, and Moore were given special 
treatment, including a private car and audiences with the Vietnamese deputy 
premier, the country's deputy foreign minister, and the general secretary of 
the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 At each stop Monday, Moore impressed upon local officials that Orange County's 
80,000 businesses and 2.5 million people could serve as an important boost to 
the fledgling local economy. Orange County has the largest population of 
Vietnamese outside Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we (the countywide chamber) are a valued, added component to the trade 
mission," said Moore, 51, who has been the organization's president for two 
years. "Interest in Vietnam is wider than just the overseas Vietnamese. In 
fact, there is a broad-based interest in Orange County to do business with 
Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, international trade and investment with Vietnam is expected to 
total about $9 billion, according to the United States-Vietnamese Trade Council 
in Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 Moore said the county chamber officials considered the trade mission so 
important that they scraped together $5,000 from their depleted budget to send 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheng, 50, is also encouraged about the business outlook between Orange County 
and the Southeast Asian country. Cheng is evaluating whether Cathay Bank can 
become a major player in connecting Southern California and Vietnamese 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the rest of the stay here, I would like to meet local bankers to 
understand the banking industry," Cheng said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheng is most concerned about the stability of the Vietnamese economy and 
ensuring that foreign investments are not wasted. He asked deputy foreign 
minister Le Mai about Vietnam's chances in gaining most-favored nation status 
with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Pham asked government officials to consider proposals that would 
allow overseas Vietnamese to claim or buy back property lost when they fled the 
war-torn country. Pham also asked officials to relax their policies so that 
foreigners -- and especially overseas Vietnamese -- could own property in 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 According to deputy foreign minister Mai, Vietnam is striving to rebuild its 
economy and cannot commit to the group's requests as yet. He said Vietnam must 
first commit itself to upgrading the country's infrastructure -- especially 
roads, bridges and its communications network. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still a developing a nation," Mai said. "Many things require 
patience." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Mai said the Vietnamese economy is improving, pointing to an annual 
growth rate that could reach 9% next year. He added that Vietnam would like to 
send thousands of college students to the United States for an education. 
</P>
<P>
 While Vietnamese leaders have welcomed the American trade mission, some Orange 
County Vietnamese strongly opposed the delegation's direct contact with the 
communist regime. Before the delegates' departure, several hundred protesters 
converged on Pham's office to denounce the impending visit. 
</P>
<P>
 But the American delegates seemed pleased with what they've heard and seen of 
the business climate thus far. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade delegation really consists of 24 smaller missions, with each person 
advancing a particular business agenda. Some want to export aviation equipment, 
others are promoting food processing systems or laundry detergents. Another 
delegate is a real estate developer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still a lot questions to get answered," Elliott said. "We want to 
come here and make a buck and not to lose it. So how do we deal with the 
communists?"

BAFFLING SPILL; BEACHES CLOSE AS FLOW'S SOURCE IS CHECKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 A mysterious spill that residents say has poured from a storm drain into the 
ocean at a popular diving cove for at least four days sent city officials 
scrambling Monday to plug it and determine if it was sewage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the Orange County Health Care Agency closed a 
three-quarter-mile stretch of beach from Aster Street at the south end of 
Heisler Park north to Fairview Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and beach-goers were irked that while the unusual flow from a pipe 
at Fisherman's Cove was reported Friday night, no contaminated water signs were 
posted there or at adjacent coves until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisherman's Cove, also known as Boat Canyon Cove, was packed with swimmers and 
divers all weekend, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lobster season just opened," said Marlene Davis, a visitor from Tempe, Ariz. 
"This place was loaded with lobster divers (Sunday). Loaded." 
</P>
<P>
 A county official said the health agency was not alerted to the problem until 
sometime before 8 a.m. Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to believe it took so long to get action," said Robert R. Mosier, 
who reported the flow. "Because the people were swimming all weekend, it scares 
me a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially on Monday, City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said the flow originated 
from a clogged or broken underground sewer main that somehow had leaked into a 
storm drain. Later, however, Frank said that did not seem to be the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know what it is," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Samples from the flow were forwarded to the South Coast Water District, which 
had determined by Monday night that it "could be sewage," city engineer Russ 
Cox said. "We're still not convinced" that it is, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 At 9:30 p.m,, half a dozen people were still a work at the site. They they had 
blocked the storm drain outfall and rerouted it with temporary pipelines to the 
Boat Canyon Pump Station about 100 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've intercepted almost all the sewage now so it's not going onto the beach 
anymore," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is also testing samples. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosier's wife, Beverly, whose home overlooks the 72-inch storm drain, said she 
first noticed the unusual flow Thursday morning as she sat in her spa on a 
wooden deck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how long it was running before I noticed it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Mosier, who is president of the Laguna Beach Taxpayers Assn., said he 
first thought someone might be emptying a swimming pool. When he noticed liquid 
still gushing from the drain late Friday night, Mosier called city police. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was not stopped Saturday, he called the Laguna Beach County Water 
District, Mosier said. A district official returned the call Sunday night and 
said the problem was "probably a sewer leak," Mosier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Water district officials could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the call Friday night, Frank said, a water district worker 
repaired a leaky fire hydrant at Monterey and Cliff drives overnight, thinking 
that was causing the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody checked to see if there was still water coming out of the storm 
drain," Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Frank said, a water district worker responded to Mosier's second 
call and toured the area. About noon, Frank said, the district worker called a 
city sewer division employee, and the two apparently miscommunicated about how 
to respond to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank said the city worker thought the water district worker was going to call 
the city back if the flow continued. When the district employee did not call 
back, the city worker did not check the storm drain to see if it was still 
gushing, Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At best, there might have been a little miscommunication between the 
parties," Frank said, adding that the city worker should have been more 
assertive about following up on the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 If the incident is a sewer spill as Frank first suspected, it would be 
particularly frustrating for Laguna Beach officials, as this environmentally 
conscious city has been plagued with such problems in recent years.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials have been so upset about repeated sewer spills in the Aliso 
Creek area at the south end of town that they held a multiagency meeting on the 
subject last month. A task force was formed to address the problem of urban 
runoff and sewage spills.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; PARAMEDIC TEAM ADDED TO TRASK AVENUE FIRE 
STATION

<P>
 A paramedic team has joined the fire station on Trask Avenue to serve 
residents in the city's southeast area. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Chief Vincent Bonacker said the addition this week of a paramedic team at 
Fire Station No. 3 at 12132 Trask Ave. means four of the city's seven fire 
stations now have paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 A paramedic team consists of a captain, an engineer who drives the fire engine 
and a paramedic-firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonacker said that the team at Fire Station No. 3 will not involve additional 
expense because a trained paramedic will be added to an existing engine 
company.  
</P>
<P>
 Bonacker said that it is part of the Fire Department's effort to meet the 
increasing demand for emergency medical assistance, which makes up a majority 
of calls to the fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
 The paramedic, also a trained firefighter, will be responsible for operating 
emergency medical equipment and evaluating the condition of patients before the 
arrival of regular paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will help reduce medical emergency response times and increase the level 
of service at no additional cost," Bonacker said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are paramedic teams at the Fire Department headquarters on Acacia 
Parkway, Station No. 2 at 11805 Gilbert Avenue and Station No. 5 at 12751 
Western Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 The 93-member Garden Grove Fire Department has 23 paramedics. It does not have 
its own ambulance service but contracts with Southland Life Fleet, a private 
company based in Anaheim.BERT ELJERA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; DOING FLIPS OVER NEW SKATEBOARD PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Skateboarders celebrated the opening of the city's second skateboard park last 
week by doing flips on a pyramid-shaped ramp and flying into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good place to go without getting into trouble because most places they 
kick you out," said John Coon, 21, a professional skateboarder and Huntington 
Beach resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Enthusiasts who flocked to the concrete playground near Main Street and 
Yorktown Avenue had only these complaints: the skateboard park was too small, 
and there should be more of them. "It's small, but it's a place to go," said 
Shon Farren, 20, of Brea. "They have a lot of obstacles here that are similar 
(to obstacles) in contests." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Coon: "I totally appreciate it."  
</P>
<P>
 The skateboard park is a joint venture between the city and Huntington Beach 
Union High School District. The project also included sprucing up the entry to 
Huntington Beach High School's stadium, Cap Sheue Field, with new landscaping, 
ticket booths and fencing. Community Services deputy director Jim Engle said 
the project cost $215,000, including $70,000 from the high school district. 
Redevelopment funds were used to help pay for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The park is the brainchild of the school's principal, Jim Staunton. "It's part 
of the culture here," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "This was done in a spirit of cooperation to understand their needs," Staunton 
said. DEBRA CANO

<P>
 Orange County activists are hailing a new state law that cracks down on people 
who drive with suspended or revoked licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of more than 50 residents from Seal Beach and surrounding cities have 
been pushing for the "safe streets" law since July, when a 12-year-old boy was 
struck by a car and killed while waiting to cross Seal Beach Boulevard.Police 
said the accident was caused by a woman driving on a suspended license. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson last week signed legislation creating the law, which requires 
that people caught driving with invalid licenses forfeit their cars. The law 
applies only to drivers who have been convicted in the past five years of 
driving with a suspended or revoked license. It goes into effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach resident Renee Handler, leader of the local group pushing for the 
law, said its passage brought "mixed emotions." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very positive that this passed. But I also felt a wave of sadness 
because it reminded me that this little boy died for no reason at all," Handler 
said.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: VILLA PARK; CITIES TO SHARE COST OF REPAIRING TAFT AVENUE

<P>
 Taft Avenue divides Villa Park and Orange, so the two cities are dividing the 
cost of repairing the avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Villa Park City Council unanimously voted last week for a joint agreement 
with Orange that calls for maintenance work on Taft Avenue from Sycamore Street 
to Loma Street.The maintenance includes street sealing and pavement 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange's share of the work is estimated to cost $21,402, and Villa Park's 
portion is estimated at $25,676. A contract will be awarded to the low bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo to the Villa Park council, City Engineer Jeff Thompson noted that 
Taft Avenue is a boundary for the two cities. "Due to the extensive work 
involved for the rehabilitation of Taft Avenue, the cities have mutually agreed 
to financially participate in this common project," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint agreement between the cities calls for the construction contract to 
be awarded by next February. BILL BILLITER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; DISSIDENTS TO PICKET LEISURE WORLD BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Disgruntled Leisure World residents plan to walk a picket line, claiming the 
governing board that runs the 8,700-resident retirement community is a "secret 
society" that ignores their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many of the people who are living in here really don't know a hell of a 
lot about what's going on," said resident Dick Kissam, 76, who is encouraging 
residents to protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Kissam says monthly meetings of the Golden Rain Foundation board squelch 
dissent by unfairly limiting public comment. Kissam and others also question 
the annual $160,000 salary paid to Leisure World administrator Habir Narang, 
saying he earns more than any city manager in Orange County. And they say his 
ownership of First Columbia Condominium Management -- the company that handles 
all sales of Leisure World's 6,608 residential units -- is a conflict of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation board renewed Narang's contract Sept. 20, with only three of 18 
board members dissenting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our attorney has stated that there is no conflict of interest," said 
foundation board President Howard McCurdy, 80. "There's always a small 
dissident group who thinks nothing is being done right." 
</P>
<P>
 Narang said residents had long ago decided his ownership of First Columbia 
would be more cost-effective. "Affordability has been preserved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But foundation board member Ellen Larsen said board procedures should be 
changed and the renewal of Narang's contract should be reconsidered. "We're 
paying him a salary to manage his own company," she said. "Wouldn't you see 
that as a conflict of interest?" RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: CYPRESS; LAW BANS ADMISSION FEES AT HOUSE PARTIES 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new city law aimed at curbing "flyer parties" is now in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Flyer parties are advertised by handbills, and admission is charged.The city's 
new ordinance makes it illegal to charge admission "to any party conducted in a 
residential zone" of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council, at its Sept. 26 meeting, unanimously voted for the new 
ordinance as an "urgency" measure, which goes into effect immediately; regular 
ordinances become law after 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The council responded to community concern over what police said was a flyer 
party on Aug. 27. That party, advertised in handbills and held in the 10300 
block of Ethel Street, resulted in gunshots, but no injuries were reported. 
Cypress police said 150 people attended, and that the average age was 14. In 
discussing ways to halt flyer parties, council members were told on Sept. 12 
that freedom-of-speech rights make it very difficult to restrict flyers and 
handbills. But the council was told that some cities, including Los Alamitos, 
have had success by forbidding admission fees to parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Violation of Cypress' law can result in a $500 fine and up to six months in 
jail. BILL BILLITER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; HIGHEST PAY GOES EVEN HIGHER AT SADDLEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faculty of the Saddleback Community College District, which already has the 
highest average pay in the state, has been given a 4% yearly raise. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase, approved Sept. 19 in closed session by district trustees, comes 
before a Nov. 8 election in which all three board incumbents seeking reelection 
have won endorsements from the faculty's union. 
</P>
<P>
 The raise, retroactive to July 1, affects both full- and part-time faculty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that they do an outstanding job, so they deserve a raise," trustee 
Joan J. Hueter said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a challenger vying for one of the three open seats on the seven-member 
board called the salary boost an affront to taxpayers during the state's 
economic woes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the union is -- I would almost use a very bad word -- 
rapacious," Juel Andersen said.  
</P>
<P>
 The college district's new salary schedule for the full-time faculty ranges 
from $30,211 to $75,527, based on education and experience. (One person 
grandfathered in under an earlier contract pay scale earns $83,080.) 
</P>
<P>
 According to the most recent figures available from the Chancellor's Office of 
California Community Colleges, Saddleback has the highest average faculty 
salary statewide. The full-time Saddleback faculty averaged $60,877 during the 
1993-94 school year, the figures show. 
</P>
<P>
 In adopting the pay increase, trustees approved a three-year contract that 
expires June 30, 1997, but leaves open how much, if any, instructors' salaries 
will increase for the 1995-96 and 1996-97 school years. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has 312 full-time faculty members and 710 people on the part-time 
faculty, said district spokeswoman Diane Riopka. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the full-time faculty, about 60 members are at the top of the pay scale, 
Riopka said. JEFF BEAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: PLACENTIA; CITY AGENCY MAY ALTER ITS PLAN FOR HOME-BUYING

<P>
 In an effort to help the city's lowest-income residents become homeowners, the 
Redevelopment Agency will consider a plan tonight to reduce the income ceiling 
on its assistance program for first-time home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The program helps provide down payments for first-time buyers.Successful 
applicants receive a 30-year deferred loan for up to 15% of the home price, to 
a maximum of $25,000. The applicant must put up at least 5% of the home price.  
</P>
<P>
 Currently, those who make up to 120% of the federal median income guidelines, 
considered moderate income families, are eligible. The new limits would make 
the median income level the upper limit. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines are based on the total income of up to eight family members per 
household. Income for a family of four, for example, must be between $29,400 
and $58,800 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia Development Director Joyce Rosenthal said that in the first two 
years of the program, most of the applicants were in the lower and middle 
portions of the eligibility range, but this year most of the applicants have 
been at the upper end of the range. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never had people right up to the maximum as we have this year," she 
said. "We want to ensure that the money we have is still available for the 
lower end of the scale." HOLLY J. WAGNERLOANS

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; MAN GETS 6 YEARS IN '82 AIRPORT BAR DEATH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Laguna Beach sailmaker who spent more than a decade on the run in 
Mexico and the Philippines was sentenced Monday to six years in prison for the 
1982 shooting death of his cousin at a crowded John Wayne Airport restaurant 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Russell Daniels, 44, was living as a farmer and running a surfing school 
when he was caught last year in the Philippines, where he had a common-law wife 
and stepson. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Daniels plotted to shoot Barclay F. Hodges on June 8, 1982, 
because he wrongly believed Hodges was having an affair with his wife. But the 
defense said the killing was not premeditated, arguing instead that Daniels 
"exploded" in a drug- and alcohol-induced rage. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodges, then 40, was facing charges of selling cocaine. He was the brother of 
then-Westminster Councilman Guinn (Gil) Hodges. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors found Daniels guilty of voluntary manslaughter rather than 
second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Richard L. Weatherspoon sentenced Daniels under the 
12-year-old guidelines at the time of the killing, when the penalty for 
voluntary manslaughter was a maximum eight years in prison. Today, Daniels 
would face up to 16 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels also did not face an additional penalty for fleeing in 1982 because 
there was no law at that time against fleeing from a criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. David Brent said he believes Daniels benefited from fleeing 
the country so many years ago, allowing the evidence to grow stale. But both 
sides agree Daniels lived a model life in the Philippines, supporting his 
family and steering clear of drug and alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, I think this was a fair sentence," Brent said. RENE LYNCH

 Dedication ceremonies for the largest science library in California will take 
place today at UC Irvine at the six-story, $33.5-million building, completed 
during a time when most colleges have been struggling with cuts in funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The 131,000-square-foot library was funded by general obligation bonds, 
approved by voters before California slipped into recession.Planning for the 
library began in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "The funding for this library was in the pipeline before the budget crunch 
really hit. The timing was in our favor," said Johanna Christensen, development 
officer for the UCI Science Library. "If we were asking voters for it today, we 
know we'd be looking at a different situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Dedication ceremonies will begin at 11:30 a.m. with music and refreshments, 
followed by a formal celebration at noon in the library courtyard.  
</P>
<P>
 The library can hold about 500,000 books and combines science, medicine and 
technology reference materials previously stored in four separate buildings on 
campus. The building has some high-tech features, including light sensors that 
automatically lower blinds on floor-to-ceiling windows when light levels could 
be harmful to books. 
</P>
<P>
 The library also has touch-screen computers that display maps of the campus. 
And more than 450 computer connection outlets will allow library patrons to use 
their own laptop computers to tap into library databases. RUSS LOAR

 The senior trustee on the Newport-Mesa Unified School District board has 
dropped out of the November election citing health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a slight heart irregularity that could be managed or handled with 
medication, but I just felt that I really didn't want to get into the pill 
business," said Rod MacMillian, who has served as a trustee for 28 years."I 
felt it was better just to reduce the stress." 
</P>
<P>
 MacMillian, 67, was a trustee of the Costa Mesa Elementary School District in 
1965, when the Newport-Mesa district unified. He joined the Newport-Mesa board 
at that time and has served seven terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation does not assure the election of Wendy Leece, the only other 
declared candidate in Trustee Area 7, said Beverly Warner, supervisor with the 
county registrar of voters. Write-in candidates may challenge Leece by filing 
declarations of candidacy with the registrar's office by Oct. 25. They need not 
gather nomination signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballots for the November election have already been printed, so MacMillian's 
name will still appear. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as we're concerned, he can't withdraw," Warner said. Warner added that 
candidates sign promises not to withdraw from the election at the filing 
deadline in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he cannot hold the office and he should win it, he would have to submit a 
letter of resignation to the district and they would decide what they wanted to 
do about it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board would have the option of appointing a new member to fill 
MacMillian's seat or holding a special election. HOLLY J. WAGNER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council tonight will consider beefing up its vendor ordinance in 
response to complaints about mobile merchants parking for several hours at a 
time on residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints have come from the Capistrano Villas and Casa Capistrano 
condominium complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposed ordinance revisions would limit to 30 minutes the time a vending 
vehicle could stay at any location. The vehicle would be required to move at 
least 100 feet to a new spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours would be limited to 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Saturday. Vendor 
activity on Sundays would be prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel W. McFarland, a city building official, said that vendors who have seen 
the revised ordinance do not have any objections. 
</P>
<P>
 McFarland said the city plans to distribute information packets in both 
English and Spanish to licensed vendors, explaining the ordinance changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, city officials "have been as aggressive as we can be" in cracking 
down on unlicensed vendors who have often chosen Sundays to sell their wares, 
McFarland said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's code enforcement officer has done everything from confiscating 
several hundred cassette tapes of illegally recorded music to issuing citations 
to people selling tamales from the trunk of a car, McFarland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillian Cannon, a board member of the Capistrano Villas II homeowners 
association, said the number of vendors, especially produce trucks, has 
increased in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Cannon questioned whether the city will have the ability to enforce the 
tougher ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the revised ordinance is wonderful, but I've got to tell you that 
when I see them enforcing it, I'll be a believer," Cannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 McFarland said that two building inspectors will be required to help the code 
enforcement officer whenever possible. JEFF BEAN

<P>
 After spending 17 years training the mentally disadvantaged from their 
warehouse facility, Saddleback Community Enterprises has expanded its quarters 
and programs by moving to a new location. 
</P>
<P>
 To celebrate, Saddleback Community Enterprises officials are inviting the 
public to an open house at 26041 Pala on Nov. 4 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. A 
ribbon-cutting ceremony will be held at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The new, two-story headquarters will feature easy access for physically 
disabled persons and a state-of-the-art phone system donated by Toshiba 
Information Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit organization teaches job skills to 236 mentally challenged 
persons, then finds them work in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Disabilities range from mild to the more severe. Those with the worst 
afflictions are shown simple life skills, such as how to use cutlery. 
</P>
<P>
 But others are capable of working in the outside world and supporting 
themselves with jobs found by the Saddleback Community Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization shows prospective employers how to qualify for direct federal 
subsidies and tax breaks. They also have job counselors who provide on-site 
assistance for as long as the Saddleback Community Enterprises student needs 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, the new facility is near an Orange County Transit Authority bus 
stop, which is an advantage for employees and clients, especially those with 
disabilities, said company officials. 
</P>
<P>
 For information about the program or the open house, call (714) 837-7280.

 City officials this week will unveil five design alternatives for a project 
envisioned as the centerpiece of downtown redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 A workshop at 7 p.m. Thursday will be repeated Friday.Both meetings are at 
City Hall, 32400 Paseo Adelanto. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents are invited to attend and comment on the five alternatives by 
filling out cards that will be available. Questions may also be asked of the 
city's planning staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The Historic Town Center has long been proposed for a six-acre parcel of 
city-owned land that straddles El Camino Real, south of Ortega Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 A plan for a 125-room hotel and large retail complex was scuttled in the late 
1980s after opposition from preservationists. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, city officials have said they wanted residents to take a more 
active part in the project's planning. JEFF BEAN

SANTA ANA SETTLES LAWSUIT CLAIMING JAIL BEATING; COURTS: MAN WHO SAID HE WAS 
ASSAULTED IN CITY JAIL IN 1992 RECEIVES $200,000. CITY DENIES ANY WRONGDOING 
BUT AGREES TO PAYMENT TO AVOID POSSIBLE HIGHER JURY AWARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The City Council has authorized a $200,000 settlement in the case of a man who 
alleged that he was beaten by police in a city jail cell two years ago and 
spent 10 months in a coma. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Salinas, 46, was arrested by Santa Ana police officers for public 
drunkenness and outstanding warrants in March, 1992, after he was found lying 
on a Sullivan Street sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court documents, the Orange County Jail would not take Salinas 
because he was too drunk to be held there. However, he was "conscious, 
responsive and uninjured" shortly after his arrest, court documents said. 
</P>
<P>
 By early the next morning, an officer who checked on Salinas in his holding 
cell at the Santa Ana Police Department noticed that his lips were pale and saw 
blood in his mouth. Salinas was then taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana 
and was diagnosed with a brain injury, court documents said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleged that Salinas was severely beaten while in custody, 
remained in a coma for 10 months, and still suffers from poor memory and motor 
function, incontinence, dizziness, pain in his arm and leg and bad sleep 
patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials say there was no evidence that Salinas was beaten while in 
jail, whether by police or by other inmates in his cell. 
</P>
<P>
 The city settled the case in order to avoid a possible higher award that 
jurors might have imposed if they felt the city should have sought medical care 
for Salinas sooner, said Assistant City Atty. Robert Wheeler. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was absolutely no evidence that he was beaten by any police officer or 
any other individual for that matter," Wheeler said. "The city categorically 
denies any such allegation. We had a highly intoxicated individual who did not 
know where he lived, who had outstanding warrants on him. We monitored him 
throughout the night. When we checked on him in the morning, his physical 
condition had changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler said officers noticed a small abrasion on the back of Salinas' head 
and a spot of blood on the sidewalk when they arrested him. But when he was 
roused, he was semi-coherent, the blood in his hair had already begun to dry, 
and officers who checked on him throughout the night were able to wake him, 
Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He said officers believed that Salinas was merely intoxicated and that his 
wound was superficial, but that he must have suffered an injury "while he was 
on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously it's a very fair settlement to the city. A jury verdict could have 
been much higher," Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas' attorney, Randall H. Scarlett, who worked for the San Francisco law 
firm of Melvin Belli when he was retained, could not be reached for comment 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit was filed in Orange County Superior Court in March, 1993, and 
named the city, the Santa Ana Police Department and the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department as defendants. It alleged that the defendants "brutally and 
physically assaulted (Salinas) during the period of time he was in custody." 
</P>
<P>
 Scarlett agreed to drop the Sheriff's Department from the suit earlier this 
year because Salinas was never booked into the Orange County Jail, an attorney 
for that agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarlett had asked the Santa Ana Police Department to produce internal affairs 
documents on Salinas' arrest. Those documents contained interviews with four 
police personnel and statements of eight police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas' attorney also sought any internal affairs documents that detailed 
disciplinary actions against five police officers who had been in contact with 
Salinas on the night of his arrest and incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had argued that releasing those documents would compromise the Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler said that because city officials felt there was no evidence that 
officers had beaten Salinas, they resisted opening the internal affairs files 
to the courts for scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 The case had been set for trial Monday in Orange County Superior Court, , but 
attorneys notified the court of a settlement last week. 
</P>
<P>
 In closed session at its Sept. 19 meeting, the City Council authorized the 
$200,000 settlement in the case.

<P>
 So it's not Cooperstown. The Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District 
Hall of Fame still boasts some heavy hitters, including state Sen. John R. 
Lewis (R-Orange) and Olympic champion swimmer Janet Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the district is looking for other graduates with gold medal qualifications 
to be inducted into the hall this school year. Candidates being sought are 
graduates of El Dorado, Valencia, Esperanza or El Camino Real high schools who 
have become successful in their chosen fields and are contributing members of 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates must also demonstrate high personal and professional standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hall of Fame was begun in January, 1992, to highlight the achievements of 
local students. In addition to Evans and Lewis, inductees include Elisa Bell, a 
screenwriter who graduated from Esperanza, and Rick Aguirre, an attorney and 
Valencia graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 Nominations will be accepted from teachers, district employees and community 
members through Oct. 21. The 1994-95 school year's inductees will be announced 
next spring.  
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call the district office at (714) 996-2550.

LOCAL ELECTIONS / LA PALMA; WIDE OPEN COUNCIL CONTEST INCLUDES NO INCUMBENTS; 
MOST OF THE CANDIDATES AGREE THAT A MAJOR PROBLEM IS PRESENTED BY REVENUE 
LOSSES THAT THE CITY HAS SUFFERED IN RECENT YEARS BECAUSE OF STATE BUDGET 
CUTBACKS. 
</P>

<P>
 Two things stand out in the Nov. 8 City Council election: no incumbents and 
declining revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The two incumbent council members chose not to seek reelection, and as a 
result the races for both their seats are wide open. And most of the candidates 
seeking the slots on the City Council agree that declining city revenue, mainly 
because of state cutbacks, is a major municipal problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Councilman Larry A. Herman is completing his second term and chose 
not to run again, thus honoring an unenforceable law on the city's books that 
forbids more than two terms. Under state law, the ordinance cannot be enforced 
because La Palma, as a non-charter city, is not empowered to set such term 
limits. Charter cities may have such ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 The other incumbent, Councilman David Lim, was appointed to the council two 
years ago when Councilman Orbrey Duke became unable to complete his term 
because of a heart ailment. Though eligible to seek a full term, Lim chose not 
to. 
</P>
<P>
 Four people are seeking the two open council seats. The contenders are Kenneth 
Blake, Alta E. Duke, Charlene Hatakeyama and the Rev. Gerald L. Patton Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake, 47, is a controller-accountant in private business. He is chairman of 
the city's Cultural and Beautification Committee and has served on the La Palma 
Day Parade Committee and the city's Blue Ribbon Finance Committee. He is a 
member of La Palma Kiwanis Club and the Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake, who is married and has two sons, ages 11 and 19, has lived in the city 
for 23 years. He praised the council and city staff for maintaining superior 
municipal service despite state budget cuts. He said he wants to continue that 
effort and to keep the city attractive and free of graffiti. Blake also said he 
wants to attract small businesses to the city, to bolster municipal income. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke, 61, is the wife of former Councilman Duke. She has worked on the city of 
Downey municipal staff for the last 29 years and is now Downey's social 
services manager. She said her long experience in municipal government suits 
her well for the La Palma council. She also said her work as a city staffer has 
given her a strong background in dealing with the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke said that she sees maintaining city services and quality of life in La 
Palma, despite shrinking budgets, as a major challenge for the City Council. 
She and her husband have two grown children and six grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatakeyama, 48, is an insurance agent and is state-credentialed as an 
elementary school teacher. She is president of the La Palma Chamber of Commerce 
and has served as treasurer of the La Palma Lions Club and as a member of the 
city's Cultural and Beautification Committee and Blue Ribbon Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatakeyama said she wants to help the city's financial stability, promote a 
favorable business climate and strengthen the public-private partnership. She 
said state cutbacks to city funding make it a challenging time for the city to 
try to maintain and improve services to residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Patton, 64, is an ordained Baptist minister and a retired investigator for the 
Internal Revenue Service. He operates a private investigations service, 
specializing in missing persons, and he has been chaplain for the La Palma 
Police Department for 15 years. He and his wife have three grown children. 
</P>
<P>
 Patton said he sees a need for stressing family and Biblical values. He also 
identified himself as a strong conservative. He is active in Masonic 
organizations.

U.S. GOVERNMENT PUTS NIXON FUNERAL COSTS AT $311,039; SERVICES: YORBA LINDA IS 
NOT REIMBURSED FOR NEARLY $100,000 IN SECURITY AND OTHER EXPENSES. THE AGENCY 
IN CHARGE SAYS THE CITY DID NOT PUT IN FOR PAYMENT.

<P>
 Richard Nixon's funeral in Yorba Linda cost the federal government $311,039. 
It cost the city nearly $100,000, which the government will not reimburse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Military District of Washington, which was in charge of the government's 
arrangements, released the figures Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 The federal government will not pay Yorba Linda close to $100,000 it cost to 
provide security for the service, saying the city had never formally requested 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force spent $211,582, which included the $25,000 cost of taking 
President Clinton and invited dignitaries across the country on Air Force One 
and $150,000 for two C-141 transports carrying troops for the honor guard. 
</P>
<P>
 The former President, who died on April 22 after an earlier massive stroke, is 
buried next to his wife on the grounds of the privately financed Richard Nixon 
Library & Birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The city said its expenses totaled about $98,000 to handle 34,000 people who 
either paid their last respects or stood outside of the grounds while 8,000 
invited guests attended the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 A city councilman, Mark Schwing, had suggested that the federal government 
help pick up that tab, too. The office of the area's congressman, Rep. Jay C. 
Kim (R-Diamond Bar) said the idea never was pushed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We approached Jay Kim's office informally to inquire if we could be 
reimbursed," Schwing said Monday. "I believe we were told that there were no 
provisions to reimburse the city for that. I don't think it's fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwing said that the city should be repaid because "a good bit of our cost 
was for protection of the dignitaries and the President," a cost the military 
would have had to bear if the funeral had taken place in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have been reimbursed for it. Certainly, it was money that came out 
of general fund or reserves, normally used for the betterment of the city. " 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Early, budget director for the General Services Administration, said he 
never received a formal request for reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government's costs also included $62,635 by the Marine Corps, 
$26,764 by the Army, $4,433 by the Army National Guard, $3,500 by the Navy and 
$2,125 by the Air National Guard, the Military District of Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, which contracts with the Brea Police Department, spent $30,500 on 
police wages and another $21,700 on police overtime; $18,700 in other personnel 
costs; $26,700 for workers to erect and pick up street barriers, cones and 
barricades that diverted traffic from the library and $323 on food, according 
to city authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half of the $98,000 the city spent on the funeral would have been spent 
on daily services, even if the funeral had not taken place, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trash collection and street sweeping was done by city employees who donated 
their time. Local businesses donated food for the officers who directed traffic 
and patrolled during a nightlong vigil before the service. A grocery chain 
donated 600 pounds of macaroni salad. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also had borne the costs of Nixon's visits to the library and the 
costs of Pat Nixon's funeral, including security. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton took a diverse delegation of political figures to the 
funeral, including former Sen. George McGovern, the South Dakota Democrat who 
Nixon defeated in a landslide in the 1972 presidential election. There also 
were congressional leaders, nine members of Nixon's Cabinet and officials who 
had served under Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan or Bush. All five Presidents 
who have succeeded Nixon attended the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime early next year the Government Printing Office will turn out a 
"eulogy book" that incorporates the speeches members of Congress delivered on 
the House and Senate floors. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated publishing run is 32,500 copies, of which 22,150 are for use of 
the House and the rest for the Senate. The books will not go on public sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Chambers of the Joint Committee on Printing, who will edit the volume, 
said eulogy books have been printed after the deaths of nearly all of the 
country's Presidents. She said the publication of Nixon's book will follow 
those of Rep. William Natcher (D-Ky.), who died in March after an unmatched 
streak of 18,401 consecutive House votes; former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy 
Onassis; former House Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.), and 
retired Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.

A SICK PUPPY; GREYHOUND FINDS ITSELF UNDER AN AERIAL ATTACK

 Greyhound Lines, only three years out of federal Bankruptcy Court, is once 
again indeep trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's largest intercity bus company is strapped for cash and suffering 
from falling ridership. Its investors and creditors are grumbling, while its 
stock has plunged to $2 a share from $12 earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is so dire that Greyhound intentionally missed a $4.2-million 
debt payment Friday so it can use the 30-day grace period on the payment to 
negotiate an overall refinancing plan with its creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas G. Plaskett, Greyhound's chief executive, said the company has a 
recovery plan to obtain new financing and won't need a return trip to 
Bankruptcy Court. "I don't think that is necessary," he said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts wonder if Greyhound can reshape itself before its cash runs dry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their problem is time," said Betsy Snyder, a credit analyst with Standard & 
Poor's Corp. Still, she said, Plaskett had to act. "They can't continue to 
operate the way they did," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Greyhound's main competition--Southwest Airlines and other air 
carriers that provide low-cost, short-haul service--last week put even more 
pressure on the Dallas-based bus line by slashing its fares for travel this 
fall. The change came only two weeks after Greyhound had cut its fares in a bid 
to drum up passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 The airlines' fare cuts narrowed and in some cases erased Greyhound's 
traditional price advantage over air transportation, especially when one 
compares the rivals' travel times. 
</P>
<P>
 Example: With a one-day advance ticket purchase, you can take a 75-minute 
Southwest flight from Burbank to Phoenix for $31. Under Greyhound's new 
promotion, you can go from Los Angeles to Phoenix and back for $32--but the 
quickest round-trip bus ride will take 13 hours, and a seven-day advance 
purchase is required. 
</P>
<P>
 Greyhound's relatively cheap fares still appeal to many people who have 
limited incomes and the time to travel by bus. (Greyhound says the average 
household income for its bus passengers is about $16,000 a year.) 
</P>
<P>
 Others like Greyhound because the buses still stop at small towns bypassed by 
even short-hop airlines such as Southwest. And some prefer the bus for 
aesthetic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can kick back and enjoy the scenery," Martel Castaneda, a 27-year-old 
Hawthorne resident, said last week as he waited at the Downtown Los Angeles bus 
terminal for a Greyhound trip to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Also waiting was Connie Ramos, 60, who wanted to ride Greyhound only to 
Claremont, less than 40 miles away, because "I don't have to worry about being 
on the freeway." Ramos said she also makes frequent trips on Greyhound to San 
Ysidro, at the Mexican border, for $17 round-trip. 
</P>
<P>
 But for a growing number of travelers, time is more important than money, and 
Greyhound's volume is expected to drop to between 14.5 million and 15 million 
passengers this year, from 15.4 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first eight months of this year, Greyhound's load factor--the 
percentage of its available seats that were filled with passengers--slumped to 
51% from 57% in the comparable period of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 What to do? Besides looking for new financing from creditors, Plaskett is 
shrinking Greyhound's operations in order to cut its costs and focus on 
selected heavily populated markets, where the company hopes to undercut the 
airlines on price but still turn a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Greyhound will concentrate on routes between 100 and 400 miles long--the 
average Greyhound trip is already 375 miles--in such areas as Southern 
California, the Northeast, the South, the Midwest and parts of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also calls for Greyhound to eliminate up to 1,000 jobs, or nearly 10% 
of its work force, and to reduce its bus fleet by 200, to 1,700 vehicles, 
during the next 12 months. (A drivers strike, which led to Greyhound's 
bankruptcy filing in 1990, ended in April, 1993, when Greyhound and the drivers 
union agreed on a new six-year contract.) 
</P>
<P>
 Some public policy analysts have worried about Greyhound's prospects, because 
they view the company as crucial transportation for low-income travelers. 
Plaskett, too, says that "there is an argument that can be made that we do 
provide an essential service for quite a few people." 
</P>
<P>
 That role, he said, even suggests that the federal government might want to 
provide Greyhound with "loan guarantees and other kinds of non-cash assistance 
that would help us continue service." In other words, a bailout. 
</P>
<P>
 But Plaskett added, "I don't see that happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Plaskett ran Pan American World Airways for three years until 1991, when the 
famed airline ceased operations because of several factors. Some were beyond 
Plaskett's control, such as the bombing of a Pan Am jet over Scotland and the 
Persian Gulf War, both of which eroded Pan Am's traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 He was tapped to run Greyhound in August after its former chief executive, 
Frank J. Schmieder, resigned amid growing unrest from Greyhound's major 
stockholders. He also arrived after Greyhound's excess cash had dwindled to $1 
million at the end of June.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the company has about $270 million in long-term debt--compared to a 
net worth of only $91 million--most of that debt is unsecured. So Greyhound 
should be able to borrow additional secured debt using its buses and other 
assets as collateral, giving the company breathing room, Plaskett said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm confident we're going to get over these short-term hurdles," he declared. 
Greyhound's Woes 
</P>
<P>
 Losses at Greyhound Lines are growing and its cash is dwindling as more riders 
abandon the bus company in favor of low-cost airlines.

SACRAMENTO THROWS IN KITCHEN SINK IN BID FOR PACKARD BELL RELOCATION; 
RELOCATION: THE CITY IS POISED TO OFFER THE COMPUTER MAKER $26 MILLION IN LOAN 
INCENTIVES TO MOVE TO AN OLD ARMY BASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Packard Bell is on the verge of sewing up a deal to relocate to Sacramento 
that seems almost too good to be true: Above and beyond a $5-million tax break 
granted by the Legislature, the computer manufacturer is about to be offered a 
$26-million loan by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they've never before handed a pot this sweet to a company 
-- especially a marketing operation with little in the way of heavy capital 
assets to pledge as collateral -- but they believe this case warrants the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento is trying to woo one of the nation's largest computer makers to the 
Sacramento Army Depot from Chatsworth, where the Jan. 17 earthquake jolted 
Packard Bell into the realization that it wanted to flee Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will vote today on the deal, which pushed Sacramento to the 
head of a list of places -- including Utah and Oregon -- that have been 
fighting to win Packard Bell as a corporate citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 For Sacramento, the deal means a gain not only of 3,000 jobs and an 
$80-million annual payroll, but -- with the Army Depot due to close within 
three years -- a chance to be in the forefront of the nationwide defense 
conversion movement. The offer is also one more illustration of the brutal 
competition among localities for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we really have done here is create a national model for base 
conversion," Sacramento City Councilman Darrell Steinberg said. "In this day 
and age, this is the kind of aggressive work that cities have to do to maintain 
a viable tax base." 
</P>
<P>
 Tell that to the city of Palmdale, which tried to catch Packard Bell's eye but 
in the end couldn't compete with the negotiations under way in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman William J. (Pete) Knight (R-Palmdale), who helped spearhead 
attempts to lure Packard Bell to the Antelope Valley, said his coalition was 
prepared to offer a combined package of $40 million in incentives. But the firm 
wasn't interested. Company officials said in a memo that Palmdale, perched on 
the San Andreas fault, posed an "unacceptable earthquake risk." 
</P>
<P>
 To help cover Packard Bell's moving expenses, Palmdale offered a reimbursement 
of $3 million three years after the costs were incurred. But Sacramento is 
poised to offer a $6-million to $9-million relocation loan up front. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Packard Bell decided to move to Palmdale, it would have had to build a new 
facility, though it would have gotten a deal on the land. The Sacramento 
proposal gives the firm a $17-million loan to upgrade existing depot buildings 
as it sees fit. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento city officials say that had they not found Packard Bell, they would 
have had to spend $19 million to renovate the depot's 50-year-old structures. 
Looking at the numbers that way, the city figures it is only going out on a 
limb for $7 million of the proposed $26-million deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "People talk about the risks and the fact that the city is going to lend $26 
million," Steinberg said. "I turn the question around and say, what are the 
risks to the city and the community of not doing the deal with Packard Bell? 
What you would have left is a large military base." 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the deal, Packard Bell would have five years to repay the 
relocation loan and 12 years to pay back the loan for improvements. After 
remaining on the base for 10 years, the company would have an option to 
purchase the 210 acres it will occupy for $6.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 For the state's part, Gov. Pete Wilson last week signed a bill by state Sen. 
Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael) that would give Packard Bell a $5-million tax break 
by creating an enterprise zone at the Sacramento Army Depot. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard Bell has hinted that it will accept Sacramento's offer if one comes 
from the City Council, but the firm is carefully hedging its comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The offer from Sacramento is a nice offer, and Packard Bell would be 
delighted to stay in California," spokeswoman Liz O'Donnell said.

COMPANY TOWN; NO HARMONY IN BEACH BOY SUIT BETWEEN COUSINS LOVE AND WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Across the street from the satellite dishes beaming to the world each detail 
of the O.J. Simpson hearings, another celebrity legal battle is taking place -- 
this one to a mostly empty federal courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection is expected to start today in Love vs. Wilson, as in Mike Love 
and his cousin Brian Wilson, both founding members of the legendary music group 
the Beach Boys. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. District Court case marks the latest feud involving the first family 
of Southern California rock, whose dysfunctional side stands in stark contrast 
to the group's feel-good music. Its members have seemingly spent as much time 
battling in courtrooms as in recording studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Love wants money and additional writing credits he feels are owed him for his 
alleged contributions to 79 songs. They range from the Beach Boys anthem 
"California Girls," for which he has received no credit over the years, to 
"Good Vibrations," for which he says he deserves more credit -- and a bigger 
slice of songwriting royalties -- than he's been getting. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's lawyers counter that Love is 25 to 30 years too late in bringing his 
case. They allege that he wants credit for songs he didn't write or barely 
contributed to, and is out to enrich himself at his cousin's expense. They also 
say Love in 1969 signed a letter acknowledging the accuracy of songwriting 
credits and failed to request additional credit and royalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Love is asking for a third of a $10-million out-of-court 
settlement Wilson received in 1992 after he alleged that the Beach Boys' "Sea 
of Tunes" song catalogue was fraudulently sold by his domineering father, the 
late Murry Wilson, for $700,000 to Irving Music. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Wilson alleged that his father coerced him into giving up his interest 
in the company that administered the songs. He also alleged that Murry Wilson 
engineered the sale with help from entertainment lawyer Abraham Somer, who 
Brian Wilson alleges advised him that there was nothing he could do to stop the 
sale. Wilson alleged that Somer had a conflict of interest because he 
represented Irving Music. The case was settled before trial. 
</P>
<P>
 That $700,000 paid for the catalogue is considered a huge bargain today. Some 
estimate it could be worth $40 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
 The puns come easy. Bad vibrations. No more fun, fun, fun. Wouldn't it be nice 
if they could work out their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 That isn't likely to happen with both sides so far apart, and considering the 
amount of sniping going on between the two. Love lawyer Michael J. Flynn says 
the singer wants to pursue the case in court because he believes the issue is 
as much about musical artists being exploited by lawyers as it is about who 
wrote "Well, East Coast girls are really hip, I really dig those styles they 
wear." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Flynn: "Mike Love wants this whole thing exposed." 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn says Love is also angry that as much as $6 million of Wilson's money has 
been eaten away in attorney fees related to the case when Love is asking for 
much less. Flynn vows to present evidence that Love objected to the 1969 sale 
but was told by a lawyer that he had no recourse. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson lawyer Douglas Day argues that Love sees the opportunity to make money 
from Wilson's successful settlement over his songwriting rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "This lawsuit is about Mike Love wanting to take money from Brian after Brian 
was successful in his own litigation to reclaim his publishing rights, which 
are claims Mike was never entitled to," Day said. "Brian is eagerly awaiting 
the opportunity for the jury to hear the conflicting claims of Mike Love and 
Brian's own story."  
</P>
<P>
 Day further argues that Love has forced Wilson to spend the money on lawyers 
by pursuing the case and by initially asking for more than $30 million. "Brian 
has had no choice but to defend this," Day said. 
</P>
<P>
 Love received a $1.5-million payment from an insurance company after he sued 
Wilson and publisher HarperCollins for slander stemming from Wilson's 1991 
autobiography, "Wouldn't It Be Nice." 
</P>
<P>
 He also received a $1.6-million settlement from a group of lawyers and Irving 
Music, named as defendants in the original lawsuit with Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Wilson and Love testified in a pretrial evidence hearing last week, 
providing vivid reminders that the Beach Boys are hardly boys, but rather 
middle-aged men fighting over events that took place decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Love described himself and Wilson as a "successful songwriting team" in the 
1960s, saying he listened to the music Wilson created and wrote the words. 
</P>
<P>
 While on the stand, Wilson discussed his well-publicized psychological 
problems, saying he takes four different medications, including one because he 
"hears voices."

PEPSI IN $20-MILLION PARTNERSHIP TO RETURN TO S. AFRICAN MARKET; INVESTMENT: 
GROUP OF PROMINENT AFRICAN AMERICANS AND SOFT DRINK MAKER ANNOUNCE JOINT 
VENTURE IN POST-APARTHEID NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A group of prominent African Americans, including actor Danny Glover and 
basketball star Shaquille O'Neal, on Monday announced a $20-million partnership 
with Pepsi to reintroduce the company's products to South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement -- designed to encourage others to make similar investments 
-- coincided with South African President Nelson Mandela's trip to New York in 
search of U.S. business investment in his post-apartheid nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The soft drink venture -- believed to be among the largest by a group of 
individuals since Mandela renounced economic sanctions against South Africa 
last year -- comes as companies are slowly considering investing in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies that have announced a desire to reinvest in South Africa are 
CPC International, Eastman Kodak, Honeywell, International Business Machines 
and Sara Lee, according to the Investors Responsibility Research Center in 
Washington. Apple Computer, Hyatt International, Reebok and USAfrica Airways 
have all entered South Africa for the first time within the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, 30 U.S. companies have invested in South Africa since Mandela 
renounced the sanctions last September, the research center said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors in the venture with Pepsi-Cola International said they consider it 
appropriate for those who once worked for sweeping political changes in the 
formerly white-ruled country to support its new black leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Announcement of the venture was timed to coincide with Mandela's visit, said 
James A. Lawrence, president of Pepsi's Asia, Middle East and Africa 
operations. Mandela told the General Assembly at the United Nations on Monday 
that economic development is crucial to the survival of South African 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it was important to give him (Mandela) as much ammunition as 
possible in seeking out investors by being able to say, 'Look what Pepsi is 
doing,' " Lawrence said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investors group, which includes Motown Records executives Jheryl Busby and 
Clarence Avant, attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. and publisher Earl Graves, will 
initially provide $15 million and control 75% of the bottling venture. Pepsi 
will provide $5 million in start-up capital, with a goal of investing $100 
million over the next three years, Lawrence said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepsi had announced in June that it planned to re-enter the South African 
market, which it left in 1985 in protest of apartheid, the government's policy 
of strict racial segregation and political and economic discrimination against 
nonwhites. 
</P>
<P>
 The new venture could prove golden for South Africa and Pepsi, said Bill 
Moses, a senior analyst with the research center. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got some of the best-known black businessmen and managers here working 
with South African businessmen," he said. "You've got a real chance for success 
with that package." 
</P>
<P>
 The increased incomes of South Africans could benefit Pepsi especially, Moses 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they (South Africans) get some money, they are going to buy sodas," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moses noted that Pepsi may have to battle for its share of the nation's 40 
million consumers. Coca-Cola now controls more than 90% of South Africa's cola 
market.

 Fraud, Misuse Cited in Disaster Aid Program: Farmers have inflated crop 
losses, lied about acreage planted and failed to harvest crops when prices fell 
below what they would get in disaster aid, say investigators at the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Senate.The aid program has paid billions 
of dollars to farmers who suffered crop losses caused by the Midwest floods of 
1993 and Hurricane Andrew in 1992. In some cases, producers claimed disaster 
losses rather than harvesting or marketing their crops when prices had fallen, 
investigators said. They said overpayments might account for $300 million, or 
up to 16%, of the $2.4 billion paid out during the period studied.

 Hondo Oil Seeks to Restructure Debt: The Roswell, N.M.-based company founded 
by former Atlantic Richfield Co.Chairman Robert O. Anderson is in talks to 
restructure its $77.7-million long-term debt owed Lonrho, a London-based 
minerals concern with a 39% stake in Hondo, a spokesman said. Cash flow is a 
critical issue for Hondo, which hasn't made a quarterly profit since 1992. 
During the nine months ended June 30, Hondo had about $1.5 million in cash 
inflow, about $1 million of which came from the sale of assets. The petroleum 
producer sold all of its U.S. oil fields in 1992 to prospect for natural gas in 
Colombia. Last month it announced a "potentially significant" discovery there.

 Pact Reached on Pan Am Pensions: The $115-million settlement between the 
government and now-defunct Pan Am Corp. will help the government meet $900 
million in pension liabilities covering 37,000 former employees and 
retirees.Even so, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. said, it remains responsible 
for about $700 million in unfunded benefits in three plans. The federal 
insurance agency guarantees retirement benefits for about 41 million American 
workers and retirees. In return for the settlement, the agency will relinquish 
all other claims against the Pan Am estate.

 Michigan National to Sell Mission Viejo Thrift: The bank holding company, 
giving up its idea for a financial services network in Southern California, 
said it will seek a buyer for Independence One Bank of California. Michigan 
National Corp., which has shed its other out-of-state holdings, said it already 
has potential buyers both in state and out of state for its savings and loan 
subsidiary and expects to reach an agreement with one of them by early next 
year.Independence One, with $645.7 million in assets, is the former Beverly 
Hills Savings & Loan, one of California's first major thrifts to fail. Michigan 
National acquired the S&L at the end of 1988 with federal assistance that 
included a government note to pay the company $811.5 million over 10 years. The 
note was paid off Friday. SOUTHERN CAL

THE ECONOMY: REPORT FUELS INFLATION FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The indicators: The National Assn. of Purchasing Management said the 
manufacturing sector of the economy surged in September and that raw material 
prices climbed to their highest levels since August, 1988. Meanwhile, the 
Commerce Department reported a slowdown in August construction spending, the 
first in six months. 
</P>
<P>
 What they did: The purchasing managers business activity index climbed to 
58.2% from 56.2% in August. It was the 13th consecutive month the survey showed 
an expanding manufacturing sector, with a reading well above economists' 
prediction of 56.8%. A reading above 50% indicates the manufacturing sector is 
generally expanding, while a reading below that level indicates contraction. 
Construction spending fell a seasonally adjusted 0.2% to an annual rate of $505 
billion in August after being revised to show no change in July at a rate of 
$506.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 What it means: The purchasing managers index rekindled inflation fears, and 
some Wall Street economists expressed concern about the price increases and 
slower deliveries. The inflation-sensitive Treasury bond market fell in 
response to the report. Some analysts say the report adds to the likelihood 
that the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates for a sixth time this 
year to keep inflation in check. For construction spending, all of the decline 
in August spending came on privately financed construction projects, while 
government projects rose from July. Residential construction, closely watched 
as an indicator of consumer willingness to make large financial commitments, 
dropped to a rate of $237.5 billion from $239.4 billion in July.  
</P>
<P>
 Highlights: New orders increased at a higher rate in September than in August, 
the purchasing managers reported, while the employment index rose to 52.5 from 
49.4 in August, showing continued strength in the jobs market. The prices 
component of the survey, which analysts say is a reliable indicator of future 
inflation at the retail level, rose to 77.1% in September from 74.5% in August 
as commodity prices climbed. It was the highest level since a 78.2% reading in 
August, 1988. Purchasing Managers Index

WHITTAKER CEO STEPS DOWN TO REFOCUS; DEFENSE: JOSEPH F. ALIBRANDI WILL GUIDE 
COMPANY'S DEVELOPMENT OF COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L.D. STRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whittaker Corp., seeking to reduce its reliance on defense spending and 
further develop its commercial businesses, said Monday that Joseph F. Alibrandi 
will relinquish his post as chief executive in order to focus on long-term 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas A. Brancati, 58, now the Los Angeles-based company's president and 
chief operating officer, will assume the chief executive post Jan. 1. 
Alibrandi, 66, chief executive for the past 20 years, will continue as chairman 
and will remain active in the company to help guide it "through its current 
expansion and future opportunities," the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 The change reflects in part the company's resolve to boost its revenue from 
commercial products, said Donald H. Newman, an analyst for Ladenburg, Thalmann 
& Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittaker, which makes fluid control systems, defense electronic systems and 
other aerospace products, has been hurt in recent years by cuts in defense 
spending and in aircraft production by companies such as Boeing, which 
Whittaker supplies. Accordingly, it has increasingly turned its attention to 
what Brancati calls its "newest thrust into telecommunications." 
</P>
<P>
 "By turning over operating duties to (Brancati), it relieves (Alibrandi) to 
focus more as chairman on a larger strategy for the company," Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brancati said the company's strategy remains set despite any change in 
command. That strategy "emphasizes entry into the telecommunications field . . 
. through both internal development and outside acquisition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittaker has been using defense technology applications to develop products 
designed for the so-called information superhighway, Brancati said. The company 
recently developed for Pacific Bell a video file server designed to store and 
retrieve video data. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whittaker is very high on commercial and (telecommunications) potential right 
now," analyst Newman said. "And these are the areas that (Brancati) offers a 
great deal of expertise" in. 
</P>
<P>
 Alibrandi "is still the largest single shareholder in the company," Newman 
said. "This is clearly a move forward on his part." 
</P>
<P>
 Whittaker stock inched up 12.5 cents per share Monday to close at $19.25 on 
the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has risen from $13.50 earlier in the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Brancati joined Whittaker in 1987 as president of its electronic systems unit. 
In 1993, he was named president. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to serving as chief executive of Whittaker since 1974 and chairman 
since 1985, Alibrandi has been a vocal civic leader lauded for his tireless 
efforts for education reform in California.  
</P>
<P>
 The Bel Air resident led an unsuccessful effort last year to allow parents to 
send their children to the school of their choice.

MAGMA POWER ADOPTS 'POISON PILL' STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Geothermal energy producer Magma Power Co. on Monday took action to ward off a 
hostile $840-million tender offer from rival California Energy Co. of Omaha, 
adopting a "poison pill" shareholder rights package and filing suit in a Nevada 
court to prohibit a merger with the unwelcome suitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Magma Power's rights plan would trigger the issuance of so many new shares of 
stock to existing Magma Power shareholders that the stake of any hostile bidder 
would be hopelessly diluted, greatly increasing the cost of the merger, said a 
Wall Street analyst who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Magma Power said the rights plan is "designed to guard against partial tender 
offers, such as that contemplated by California Energy, and other abusive 
tactics that might be used an attempt to gain control of the company without 
paying all stockholders a fair price for their shares." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit filed Monday in Nevada state court in Reno asks for "declaratory 
judgment" prohibiting the tender offer under Nevada law.  
</P>
<P>
 Magma Power, which was incorporated in Nevada, still has "not formulated a 
response," a company source said, to California Energy's tender offer spelled 
out in a Sept. 19 letter from California Energy Chairman David Sokol. 
</P>
<P>
 A merger of Magma Power and California Energy would combine the two biggest 
companies in the geothermal industry.

WORD ON STREET HAS GE READY TO SELL KIDDER UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Speculation mounted on Wall Street on Monday that General Electric Co. is 
getting Kidder, Peabody & Co. in shape to unload its retail brokerage 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 PaineWebber Group Inc. was rumored to be looking at the Kidder retail unit, 
which consists of about 1,300 retail brokers, securities analysts and traders. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders also speculated that Travelers Inc., parent of broker Smith Barney 
Inc., might be interested as well. However, several Wall Street sources were 
highly skeptical of the rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked for comment, a Kidder spokesman said any news would be announced in a 
timely and appropriate fashion. A spokeswoman for PaineWebber declined to 
comment, and Travelers executives were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 The rumors were sparked by a report in the Wall Street Journal that Kidder 
would eliminate as many as 750 jobs and withdraw from foreign exchange, stock 
options and futures-related businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 It would amount to its most significant restructuring since GE bought the 
brokerage firm in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 GE has seen massive turmoil at the brokerage, having accused its former chief 
government bond trader, Joseph Jett, of creating $350 million in fictitious 
profits. Jett has denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 A Wall Street source said one of the knottier issues in any sale is 
indemnifying a buyer so there is no legal or financial responsibility for any 
of the problems stemming from Kidder's fixed-income department.

 5 GM Assembly Plants Hobbled: Work has resumed at the Buick City complex, 
where 11,500 employees ended a four-day strike Saturday by approving a deal 
under which General Motors Corp. will hire several hundred new workers. But the 
interruption in parts shipments from Flint, Mich., continued to hamstring some 
GM operations, and five assembly plants were shut down.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: Q&A; WHAT CREDIT REPORT LAW WILL MEAN FOR 
CONSUMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A measure that would make it easier and less expensive to check and correct 
consumer credit reports is now set to become law, following a hard-fought, 
four-year battle. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, called the Consumer Reporting Reform Act of 1994, passed the House 
last week and is expected to sail through the Senate. While there is always the 
chance of a change, legislators say the "bill has legs" and should be signed 
into law by President Clinton before year's end.  
</P>
<P>
 Consumer advocates are hailing the measure as a major consumer victory because 
it will reduce the cost of consumer credit reports, make it easier to delete 
inaccurate information, provide greater privacy protections and impose stiff 
penalties on companies that give out error-ridden information. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will bring the (Fair Credit Reporting) law up to modern times," said 
Sen. Christopher S. Bond (R-Missouri). "We certainly hope it doesn't get bogged 
down, because consumers really need to have these protections." 
</P>
<P>
 What exactly will the bill do? Here's a look: 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How much will it cost to get a copy of my credit report when the law goes 
into effect? A. That will depend why you're requesting the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, you are entitled to one copy annually for a maximum of $3. Credit 
bureaus could charge up to $8 per report for additional copies in the same 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as under current law, if you've been turned down for a bank account, an 
apartment a job or for credit within the past 60 days, you are entitled to a 
free copy. If you make corrections on the report, the new law says the credit 
bureau must also provide you with a second free copy to show the corrections 
have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Does the law make it easier to dispute inaccurate information? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Mainly it sets time limits. Current law says disputed information must be 
deleted from your file "within a reasonable period of time." The new law 
defines "reasonable" as 30 days.  
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the law requires all credit bureaus to operate toll-free phone 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What happens if deleted information is reinserted into my credit report? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Under the proposed law, credit bureaus must maintain procedures to prevent 
accidental reinsertion of inaccurate information. If a creditor certifies the 
accuracy of previously deleted information, it can be reinserted into your 
report. But the bureau must advise you if and when this happens. And it must 
consider "all relevant information" provided by the consumer when examining 
disputed information. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Who can look at my credit report? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Under both current and proposed law, there are four purposes for which a 
consumer's credit report can be obtained: to grant a person credit, to consider 
the person for employment, to consider him or her for insurance, and for other 
"legitimate business initiated by the consumer." If you were buying a business, 
for example, the current business owners may want to look at your credit report 
before selling. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. So any prospective employer can get a copy of my credit report? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The proposed law would narrow the instances when prospective employers 
could look at your credit report, by requiring that the employer get your 
permission. Additionally, permission could only be requested of applicants for 
certain types of jobs -- mainly managerial positions and those where the 
individual would be handling large sums of money or items of great value.  
</P>
<P>
 If you were denied employment or promotion because of information in your 
credit report, the employer would have to provide you with a copy of the 
report, a description of your rights and an opportunity to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What happens if a merchant or credit bureau violates the law? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The first step is to notify the credit bureau or credit grantor of the 
violation. They are given the right to "cure" the problem. If the violator 
refuses to do so, it faces a series of procedures and penalties written into 
the bill. They vary depending on which regulatory body -- state attorney 
generals, the Federal Trade Commission or banking regulators -- has 
jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 In some egregious cases, regulatory penalties could amount to $10,000 per 
violation, says Maggie Fisher, a legislative attorney who helped draft the 
bill.  
</P>
<P>
 If a bank or merchant has willfully provided inaccurate and damaging 
information -- and refuses to correct it -- consumers can sue separately for 
civil penalties ranging from $100 to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Does the proposed law do anything to stop unsolicited offers of credit from 
people who are getting "pre-screened" mailing lists? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Yes. It says that merchants and banks can use these lists only when they 
provide a firm offer of credit and when they tell the consumers how they got 
their names and addresses.  
</P>
<P>
 The vendor will also have to provide information about how consumers can have 
their names removed from these lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Other direct-mail solicitors are barred from using pre-screened credit 
information to sell you goods and services, says Michelle Meier, counsel for 
government affairs at Consumers Union in Washington. That doesn't mean they'll 
no longer send you mail. They just can't get information on your spending 
habits from a credit bureau.  
</P>
<P>
 Q. If this bill is passed, when will it go into effect? 
</P>
<P>
 A. One year from the day it is signed into law. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Why so long? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Credit bureaus and credit grantors will have to alter their procedures and 
formulate and print a variety of new disclosures. Legislators wanted to give 
industry adequate time to comply.

the local arena, asking regulators in five states for permission to provide 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 The move comes as local and long-distance phone companies try to invade each 
other's businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI Metro, a subsidiary of MCI Communications Corp., filed requests with state 
regulators to provide residential and business services, officials said Monday. 
The states are Washington, Maryland, Illinois, Michigan and Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 US West Inc. currently provides local phone service to Washington; Bell 
Atlantic Corp. serves Maryland and Pennsylvania, and Ameritech Corp. serves 
Illinois and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan is approved, MCI stands to gain a piece of the lucrative local 
phone market, which brings in $80 billion a year nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also let MCI bypass paying costly fees to local telephone companies 
to originate and terminate long-distance calls, analysts said. Long-distance 
companies typically pay 45 cents on every dollar of long-distance revenue to 
local phone companies for this service. 
</P>
<P>
 By skirting those fees, "prices for long-distance service should go down, so 
MCI's customers would benefit," said Michael Balhoff, an analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts believe that added competition could also drive consumer prices 
down for local service. But Balhoff thinks local rates could increase slightly 
over time as local phone companies lose revenue to new competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Ameritech, which wants permission to provide long-distance service, used MCI's 
announcement to underscore the need for regulatory symmetry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look forward to facing off in the marketplace on an equal regulatory 
footing," said Lawrence Strickling, an Ameritech vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, regional phone companies are barred from providing long-distance 
service, but a handful of phone companies are seeking to overturn the 
restriction in federal court.

PACIFIC SCIENTIFIC CREATES FLUORESCENT BULB THAT DIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pacific Scientific said Monday it has developed the first screw-in fluorescent 
light bulb that can be dimmed, making it a potential energy-saving substitute 
for incandescent lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Edgar S. Brower, chairman of the electric products maker, told a group of Wall 
Street analysts in New York that the product could add $50 million to $100 
million to his company's annual sales within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading in Pacific Scientific's stock was heavy Monday, with 221,400 shares 
changing hands in New York Stock Exchange trading. That was almost 15 times the 
average daily number of shares. The stock closed at $29.50, up $1.875. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, based in Newport Beach, said its new Solium compact fluorescent 
bulbs will provide the usual features of fluorescent compared to incandescent 
lighting. They will last 13 times longer, he said, while using a fraction of 
the electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 But their big edge will be that they can be dimmed from the incandescent 
equivalent of 100 watts of light to only 20 watts, simply by twisting a blue 
band that surrounds each large bulb. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one else can do that," Brower said. "It's quite a breakthrough." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry MacGowan, manager of worldwide applications for GE Lighting, a division 
of General Electric Co., called Pacific Scientific's new bulb "a step in the 
right direction." Devices have been available since the 1950s to dim 
fluorescent lights, he said. But the equipment has been expensive and has never 
been developed for household use. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know the consumer wants that -- they have told us -- but it has been 
difficult to do," MacGowan said. 
</P>
<P>
 GE, he said, has been working on a similar idea that would dim a fluorescent 
with a separate attachment, rather than building the feature into the bulb. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret to the Solium light, Brower said, is a microchip that makes the 
dimming feature possible. He said he expects the light will be priced 
competitively with other screw-in fluorescents, which range from $5 to $20 each 
depending on size and shape. Manufacturing is expected to start by next spring, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The light was developed by Pacific Scientific's Fisher Pierce division in 
Boston. Brower said he expects that the bulb components will be manufactured on 
the East Coast, then marketed by a major light-bulb manufacturer. Details are 
still being worked out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Scientific makes a variety of electrical products, ranging from the 
motors that power exercise treadmills to devices that switch on street lights 
automatically. It also makes fire suppression equipment for aircraft engines 
and cargo compartments as well as seat belts and restraints. 
</P>
<P>
 For the six months ended July 1, the company posted a profit of $3.9 million 
on sales of $77 million.

DEVELOPERS PLAN URBAN OASIS AT RAIL YARD SITE; HOUSING: A FLAT 100-ACRE 
TRIANGLE IS TARGETED FOR A 20-YEAR PROJECT, WHICH OFFICIALS HOPE WILL RESTORE A 
SENSE OF COMMUNITY IN THE HEART OF PORTLAND, ORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The biggest chunk of vacant land in the urban core of a major U.S. city is 
about to become one of the biggest planned neighborhoods in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Miles of railroad tracks will be torn up to make way for townhouses and small 
shops. A river bay will be carved out of an industrial waterfront and 
surrounded by a promenade. An underground creek will be brought to the surface 
for a new park that will stretch beneath the shadows of downtown office towers. 
</P>
<P>
 All that's needed is just under $1 billion and about 15,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 But the money may be easier to find than the people unless the 20-year River 
District development project is done just right. 
</P>
<P>
 "This stuff just can't be plunked down. There has to be a lot of neighborhood 
involvement and a lot of grass-roots involvement if it's going to work," said 
Charles Royer, a Portland native and former Seattle mayor now teaching at the 
John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
 Halting decades of flight to single-family homes in ever-distant suburbs may 
not be possible, Royer and others say, but this project can serve as a model 
for reducing urban sprawl and making downtown areas a community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, we can build suburbs and let the trend continue, or we can try to 
reverse that, change that, and bring people back downtown," said Bruce Allen, 
project manager for the Portland Development Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The flat 100-acre triangle juts northwest from downtown, just before the 
Willamette River makes its final bend past the city's shipyards to empty into 
the Columbia River. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlington Northern has already sold the land under its tracks, and is only 
leasing the property until development begins in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
 A plan approved by the City Council in May would require $150 million from 
local and federal government, and assumes that $750 million in private 
development will follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, whose commission will coordinate the project, says several unique 
factors will encourage investment: the size of the area, waterfront access, 
little need for environmental cleanup, expanding light-rail service, increasing 
migration to the Northwest and strong political support. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Prendergast, managing director of Prendergast & Associates Inc., the 
leading developer, says his company and city planners know they are bucking one 
trend, but they may be feeding another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nationally, people are moving back to the urban area in cities like Portland. 
That's a new trend, and it's growing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prendergast is betting that theaters, performing arts, sports, shopping and 
the sheer variety of cultural events downtown will attract people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you have two different kinds of people," he said. "There are always 
people who will want to live in a more rural setting. Conversely, there are 
people who want the diversity of downtown." 
</P>
<P>
 John Thompson, associate partner with the Portland firm Zimmer Gunsul Frasca, 
architect on the project, says a new northeastern suburb the size of the River 
District would require adding a lane to Interstate 84 at a cost of up to $3 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "For $150 million in infrastructure, we get the same number of people moving 
to Portland, but they're living downtown without driving their cars to work. 
There's real value there," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The area was first recommended for transformation from rail yard into a 
neighborhood more than a decade ago by a team of sociologists and economists 
including Jim Pettinari, now an urban planner at the University of Oregon in 
Eugene. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of atypical in the sense that it's strategically located," 
Pettinari said. "It's also huge in size. To realistically fill it up with an 
urban kind of density, it's kind of like creating another city." 
</P>
<P>
 The main question in his mind, and among other planners, is whether the 
housing will be affordable enough to attract a mix of people and incomes, 
especially families that traditionally have chosen the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 John Landis, an urban planner at UC Berkeley, is skeptical. He says Portland 
is finally feeling some of the pressure that expanded California cities away 
from their downtown cores. 
</P>
<P>
 "By and large, the history of urban California is a history of a state where 
people have come to live in a suburban community -- a single-family home is 
part of the California dream," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Landis sees few signs that Oregonians have a different dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are getting older. People have families. They want security. The 
demographic factors are pushing people out into the suburbs as never before. I 
think people want to get out of the city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The farther away from the city, the cheaper the land, and generally the 
cheaper it is to build sewers, streets, schools and other infrastructure, 
partly because there are no existing buildings to demolish and clean up. 
</P>
<P>
 The key in Portland, said Royer, like Pettinari and other planners, is 
attracting families downtown. The best way may be to build new schools as part 
of the development project, making parents and children part of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to have schools," Royer said. "I don't think it's rocket science to 
determine that. You need time to build a community. Once the white-picket fence 
phenomenon takes over, it begins working."

DRESS CODES BECOME MORE RELAXED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Signs warning patrons "No shirts, no shoes, no service" are common in some 
American cafeterias and restaurants. But at Microsoft? 
</P>
<P>
 This year, a sign, "Shoes and Shirts Required," was seen hanging from a 
cafeteria door at the software company's Redmond, Wash., headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 While a shoeless computer whiz doesn't seem out of place in a high-tech 
incubator like Microsoft, the notice itself says something about the state of 
America's business wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 Casual dress codes are becoming standard at institutions far removed from the 
Silicon Valley culture, which some retail observers credit with putting the 
corporate uniform out to pasture. 
</P>
<P>
 Casual Day is becoming a way of life rather than a special event at many U.S. 
companies where younger managers, at-home offices and corporate restructurings 
have all taken the bite out of the power suit. 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult to figure exactly how quickly companies are abandoning a strict 
dress code and what sectors of business are leading the drive. 
</P>
<P>
 A poll conducted by the Gallup Organization for Accountants on Call, a New 
Jersey employment service, showed that, while companies still maintain some 
dress code, employees are not bound to a pin-striped suit five days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 In the survey of 682 working adults in September, 1992, just 21% said they 
have a strict dress code. Another 31% had relaxed attire rules -- meaning that 
men can get away with open collars and slacks -- and 22% had a combination of a 
relaxed and rigid dress codes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made informality a much bigger part of our day-to-day lives," said 
Watts Wacker, managing partner of Yankelovich Partners, a market research firm. 
</P>
<P>
 This trend has put retailers in a tough spot. Shoppers just aren't giving in 
to far-out styles and fat price tags like they did in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly you find yourself in a very fluid time saying, 'Wow, what is my core 
business?' " said AnnTaylor chairman and chief executive Sally Frame Kasaks. 
"We had to really define ourselves not by whether women worked or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, professional women are shopping for fabrics suitable for any season, 
separates instead of suits and flexible styles for both the office and play. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're finding ultimately is that fall is shaping up as a season for 
separates," Kasaks said. "What's the trend? Is it slim? Is it straight? Is it 
full? I say 'Yes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 AnnTaylor, like many other specialty retailers, fell into a slump about two 
years ago as consumers were turned off by unpopular fashions and instead plowed 
money into their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But a turnaround has taken hold at retailers that have cut expenses and 
sharpened fashion offerings. AnnTaylor reported its earnings more than doubled 
in the second quarter to $7.9 million from $3.6 million, excluding unusual 
items. 
</P>
<P>
 At Marshall Field's, a mainstay Chicago retailer, companies have flooded its 
design director with queries about how to relax dress policies without going 
overboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the industry has had to respond to people wanting to dress down," 
said Rebecca Hitchcock, fashion director. Nonetheless "women and men are still 
buying business wardrobes each season." 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies tell workers to dress up only when necessary. At Designs Inc., 
whose stores sell exclusively Levi Strauss products, casual attire makes good 
business sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried doing it for one day (a week), and everyone loved it," said Designs 
President Joel Reichman. "And then we said, 'You know something, our associates 
are our best customers. They pay cash. They don't return stuff. Let's have them 
(dress casually) every day."' 
</P>
<P>
 The hitch is that Designs' employees have to wear the Levi brand if they're 
wearing jeans, he said. But the policy is more than a marketing tool; a relaxed 
atmosphere seems to boost productivity and communication.

ACCORD MAY HELP O.C. MAKERS OF MEDICAL DEVICES; TRADE: SALES TO JAPANESE 
HOSPITALS WOULD BE A BIG PLUS FOR AN INDUSTRY WHOSE U.S. MARKET IS SHRINKING AS 
FACILITIES MERGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The new trade accord between the United States and Japan could give a welcome 
boost to Orange County companies that already sell medical devices such as 
electro-surgical and diagnostic equipment in Asia, analysts said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. market for costly medical equipment is shrinking as hospitals and 
other health-care providers merge to share resources and reduce costs, experts 
said. That has prompted medical device makers to expand their sales overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of all the consolidation, it is a tougher industry to be in," said 
Marie Conway, an analyst with NatWest Securities in New York. "If this 
agreement allows American companies to compete with Japanese medical device 
makers such as Hitachi, it will be a big plus for the whole industry." 
</P>
<P>
 The trade pact would give makers of medical devices access to one of Japan's 
major markets: government-run hospitals. That business, estimated to be worth 
$2.6 billion annually, has historically gone to Japanese manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with Japan was never that tariffs were prohibitive," said Colleen 
Costello, a spokeswoman for the World Trade Center Assn. in Irvine. "It was 
that business and government worked so closely together it was difficult for 
newcomers to get into the market." 
</P>
<P>
 Among companies standing to benefit from the new accord is Beckman 
Instruments. The company, based in Fullerton, already sells about $114 million 
worth of medical equipment in Asia annually, most of it to Japanese buyers. By 
adding the government as a potential buyer in Japan, the company would see a 
vastly expanded market for machinery such as blood analysis systems that sell 
for $100,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are optimistic about any agreement that will allow us to compete with 
Japanese manufacturers on a more level playing field," Beckman spokeswoman 
Jeanie Herbert said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Birtcher Medical in Irvine, which now sells about $2 million in 
electro-medical surgical equipment to Japanese buyers each year, is also 
optimistic. "We have been able to sell freely in Japan," said company President 
Kenneth Cleveland, "except to the government."

JUDGE TOSSES OUT U.S. CIVIL CASE AGAINST EX-OWNER OF IRVINE THRIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert A. Ferrante, former owner of a now-defunct Irvine thrift, won another 
victory from federal officials Monday when a judge threw out the government's 
$5-million civil penalties case against him. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer dismissed the complaint filed by the 
U.S. attorney's office after Ferrante's lawyers argued that the case against 
him violated the Constitution's double jeopardy prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
 Her decision is thought to be the first to hold that a civil penalties action 
under a 1989 federal law is barred by earlier criminal proceedings, Ferrante's 
lawyers said. The federal law restructured the S&L industry and provided 
regulators and prosecutors with new powers to go after those believed to have 
caused the failures of financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrante, who owned Consolidated Savings Bank, was tried and acquitted two 
years ago on criminal conspiracy and fraud charges stemming from the 1986 
failure of the savings and loan. During trial, prosecutors also dropped other 
charges because of a lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil penalties case, filed in June, was based on the same facts that were 
involved in the criminal proceeding, Ferrante's lawyers argued. Therefore, they 
asserted, the civil case amounted to a punitive action that violated the Fifth 
Amendment's protection against putting citizens in jeopardy twice for the same 
alleged wrongdoing. Pfaelzer agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 The action is the third time that the federal government has tried to build a 
case against Ferrante. In 1990, before the criminal charges were filed, 
Ferrante settled a civil lawsuit in which federal thrift regulators had alleged 
wrongdoing. His lawyers contend that the government settled because it had 
insufficient evidence against him.

JUDGE STOPS SHORT OF NAMING TMI RECEIVER; FINANCE: HE SAYS FUNDS WERE 
IMPROPERLY COMMINGLED BUT ORDERS PARTIES IN LAWSUIT TO NEGOTIATE AN 
ALTERNATIVE.

 Saying that some money was improperly transferred without investors' 
knowledge, a judge decided Monday that the remaining retirement funds invested 
with Teachers Management & Investment Corp. may need protection from current 
management but stopped short of appointing a receiver at the Newport Beach 
financial company. 
</P>
<P>
 TMI, which has raised as much as $1 billion from 60,000 California educators 
since 1968, was sued Aug. 23 by four investors who allege that the firm lost 
more than $100 million through fraud. Company owners deny the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have evidence of commingling of funds and conflict of interest here," said 
Orange County Superior Court Judge Francisco F. Firmat. "The issue is do I use 
a sledgehammer and appoint a receiver or a surgical knife and issue some type 
of restraining order?" 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-year-old company, which hired teachers to help sell its more than 40 
real estate partnerships to other teachers, is insolvent, according to the 
lawsuit. It seeks immediate appointment of a receiver to take over management 
of the company and its assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he has the power to appoint a receiver, Firmat, citing concerns about 
the cost to investors, told lawyers for both TMI and the four investors to 
draft a compromise plan to be presented to him today. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing that a receiver should be appointed, Ron Rus, attorney for the 
investors, told the court that TMI was "caught with its hand in the cookie 
jar," by commingling investors' money from some partnerships into others. He 
said TMI management could not be trusted to report to the court on the status 
of company accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Commingling is "a huge breach of fiduciary duty which in and of itself calls 
for appointment of a receiver," Rus said. The plaintiffs have asked the court 
to select Dennis B. Schmucker, a San Diego bankruptcy expert, as receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing against the appointment, TMI's attorney, David Grant, said TMI's 
management could still make "proper business judgments," adding that "a 
blunderbuss receiver will have a drastic effect on the company and there's no 
need for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant was hopeful that a compromise plan could be reached and said it is 
possible an official from the Koll Co., a Newport Beach real estate developer, 
could work with TMI to review its books. Grant said the Koll Co. is interested 
in buying TMI. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're certainly interested in somehow being involved in the partnerships," 
said Harold Hofer, president of Koll General Partners Services, a division of 
the Koll Co.  
</P>
<P>
 Hofer said that Koll would consider helping the company if asked by the court. 
"We're interested in getting involved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors in each partnership should get to vote on whether they want a 
receiver or want TMI to remain as general partner, Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
 TMI's owners, Maurice Shuman, 56, and James R. Martin, 55, both of Newport 
Beach, admit the company has lost more than $100 million in the past seven 
years, but they blame the real estate downturn and deny allegations that they 
lost the mostly retirement money through any type of criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they maintain that the real estate recession hammered values in some 
of its 40 partnerships, reducing assets by more than 50% in some cases and 
forcing at least five partnerships into bankruptcy. The two men said they are 
just trying to turn around troubled hotel and raw land properties they 
inherited when they bought the company in 1987.

2 TOP EXECUTIVES AT DICEON RESIGN; 45 JOBS IN O.C. CUT 
</P>

 Diceon Electronics, a maker of circuit boards and back panels for computers, 
said Monday that its president and senior vice president have resigned and that 
it has cut about 15% of its work force. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine-based company said that its board of directors elected Chairman 
Milan Mandaric to the additional posts of president and chief executive officer 
after Peter Jonas resigned from those positions.Jonas will remain with the 
company as a consultant and as a member of the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Vice President James Barton has also resigned, Diceon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it will take a $1.5-million charge for the quarter ended Oct. 
1 to cover the cost of reducing the size of its West Coast operations. 
</P>
<P>
 About 125 employees, most of them administrative and operations workers, were 
laid off in the past month. Most of them worked at Diceon's plant in the 
Silicon Valley community of Mountain View, said Michael Shimada, chief 
financial officer. About 45 jobs were cut in Orange County, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts were driven by a need to lower operating costs, Diceon said. It now 
has about 210 employees in Orange County at a circuit board plant in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 For its latest fiscal year, Diceon reported a loss of $16.3 million on sales 
of $99.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's stock closed unchanged Monday at $1.31 a share in Nasdaq 
trading.

 Splitting Difference With Taxman: Del Taco Inc. in Orange has reached 
agreement with Orange County on a tax dispute, according to County Counsel 
Terry C. Andrus. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax dispute dates back to early 1993 when Del Taco voluntarily entered 
Chapter 11 proceedings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana. Various tax 
claims were made and resolved last year, but late in 1993, the company and the 
county disagreed over $134,135.07 in taxes that the county claimed it was due. 
</P>
<P>
 Because "relevant statutory and case law is ambiguous," Andrus recommended 
that the county agree to cut the tax bill in half, and Del Taco agreed to make 
the reduced payment.

HIGH COURT REFUSES SHILEY APPEAL CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to review the dismissal of an appeal 
that would have challenged a $215-million court settlement reached two years 
ago in the Shiley heart valve case. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision clears the way for payments to more than 50,000 recipients of 
potentially defective heart valves made by Irvine-based Shiley, a unit of 
Pfizer Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement, reached in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati, also includes 
money for research into detection of defective valves and an advisory panel to 
issue guidelines that could help patients implanted with the devices. 
</P>
<P>
 James Capretz, a Newport Beach lawyer who won an undisclosed settlement for 
about 300 heart-valve recipients in Orange County Superior Court last year, 
said Monday that "the Cincinnati case is of major significance to Pfizer and 
thousands of implantees. This final dismissal by the Supreme Court is extremely 
important."

MICHIGAN NATIONAL TO SHED INDEPENDENCE ONE BANK; BANKING: BUYER SOUGHT FOR 
FIVE-BRANCH MISSION VIEJO THRIFT SO FIRM CAN RETURN TO ITS ROOTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Michigan banking company that owns Independence One Bank of California 
said Monday that it will seek a buyer for the thrift and give up its plan to 
start a financial services network across Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan National Corp. said it has potential buyers both in and out of state 
for its savings and loan subsidiary and expects to reach an agreement with one 
of them by early next year. The company, which had been expected to sell the 
thrift, would not identify the potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Independence One, with $645.7 million in loans and other assets, has seen its 
home mortgage transactions drop significantly this year as a boom in home 
refinancing ended with rising interest rates. The S & L, though, has developed 
business loans and other lending that helped it record a profit of $1.9 million 
for the first six months this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been very happy with the development of the franchise, but it has 
become an obvious anomaly to our strategy," said Robert J. Mylod, Michigan 
National's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 The banking company, which has $10 billion in loans and other assets, has been 
shedding its out-of-state businesses to devote itself to its Michigan National 
Bank subsidiary. Mylod said it wants to streamline operations and provide 
better service in its home state. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question was when, not whether, the California operation would be sold," 
Edward H. Sondker, Independence One's president, said. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-branch Mission Viejo thrift is the former Beverly Hills Savings & 
Loan, which was one of the first major California thrifts to fail. The April, 
1985, collapse of Beverly Hills Savings led a wave of thrift failures as S & Ls 
nationwide were crippled with bad loans, bad management or outright fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, more than 100 California thrifts failed in a decade. Of those, 27 
were based in Orange County -- more than in any other county in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 On the last day of 1988, Michigan National bought Beverly Hills Savings with 
federal assistance that included a government promise to pay $811.5 million 
over 10 years to make up the thrift's negative net worth -- the amount of debts 
that exceeded its assets. The company put up $52 million of its own money. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan National had hoped to use the cachet of the Beverly Hills name to 
expand operations here and eventually to become a bank. But the company soon 
found itself in a Catch-22: If it converted the S & L to a bank, it would lose 
the government's tax-free payments. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the company agreed to let the government pay off its promissory 
note early. Regulators paid the remaining $348.9 million on its note plus 
accrued interest of $3.9 million. The government will save $10 million to $16 
million in interest payments by paying off the loan now. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan National will record a $51 million after-tax gain on the settlement. 
In the past few months, it has also sold its two Texas banks for a $13 million 
after-tax gain and its Independence One Mortgage Corp., a 10-state mortgage 
banking operation, for a $27 million after-tax gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan National, based in a Detroit suburb, is returning to its roots partly 
to improve what some analysts see as a lagging performance. It also has been 
under some pressure by investors to sell itself to the highest bidder. But 
Mylod told shareholders at its annual meeting in April that directors 
unanimously agreed to keep the banking company independent. Independence One

IT'S NO JOKE: 'FAR SIDE' CARTOONIST GARY LARSON TO RETIRE JAN. 1

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gary Larson, creator of the syndicated cartoon "The Far Side," plans to retire 
at the end of the year, United Press Syndicate announced today. 
</P>
<P>
 Larson has drawn his cartoons of the absurd -- featuring things like cows in 
singles bars and bacteria with family lives -- for 15 years.It is distributed 
to nearly 1,900 newspapers. The last release will appear Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released today, Larson, 44, said his reasons for retiring were 
"simple fatigue and a fear that if I continue for many more years my work will 
begin to suffer or at the very least ease into the Graveyard of Mediocre 
Cartoons." 
</P>
<P>
 Larson, who is based in Seattle, will continue to work with Universal Press on 
several proj-ects, including "The Far Side" books, calendars and greeting 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Larson received the Reuben Award for Outstanding Cartoonist of the 
Year from the National Cartoonists Society, which also named "The Far Side" the 
best syndicated panel in 1985 and 1987.

 Depression affects a person's most productive years and costs society $43.7 
billion a year, including $24 billion in lost productivity and absenteeism in 
the workplace. Symptoms include feelings of sadness or irritability, loss of 
interest or pleasure in activities, changes in weight, appetite or sleeping 
patterns, lack of energy and thoughts of suicide. Depression is a treatable 
illness affecting 17 million Americans, making it more widespread than coronary 
heart disease or cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment, usually therapy and medication, works for more than 80% of all 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday is National Depression Screening Day. Free screening and educational 
services will be held at a number of Southland sites, including: El Centro 
Human Services, 972 S. Goodrich Blvd., L.A., (213) 725-1337; DVA Out Patient 
Clinic, 351 E. Temple St., L.A., (213) 253-5016; UC Irvine, College of 
Medicine, UCI Medical Center, 101 City Drive S., Orange, (714) 456-7000.

Dope 
</P>
<P>
 You notice a tendency to forget things. You recall smoking a little dope 20 to 
30 years ago. So now you suspect that grass you did in your salad days is 
responsible for the memory lapses. Forget that -- researchers are crediting 
aging for those addlepated moments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who smoked pot have not forgotten any more than those who did not, nor 
are they any more forgetful," says Alan Searleman, psychology professor at St. 
Lawrence University. "The only drug that is demonstrated to be certainly 
associated with brain damage to areas involving memory is alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
 So if you forgot to take the car keys out of the ignition this morning, "It's 
plain old grown-up weariness brought on by the job, the kids and the mortgage."

<TEXT>
<P>
 Home alone. The car pool has come and gone and blessed silence descends. It is 
time to escape into the music.I make my choice, and from the stereo the 
electrifying sounds of "The Phantom of the Opera" blaze out. Depending on my 
mood, I will become either the tremulous, haunted Christine or the elegant, 
sensuous, tortured Phantom. Today I am the Phantom. "Down once more to the 
dungeon of my black despair" as I clean up the breakfast dishes, swirling my 
black, silken cape around me. The haunting music fills my soul. I become one 
with this poor hunted creature. All too soon the van returns and regurgitates 
my children, and I must leave my dark lair and return to the daylight.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; A TALE OF TWO CITIES -- AND TWO CENTURIES; THE LOST 
DIARIES OF FRANS HALS BY MICHAEL KERNAN ST. MARTIN'S $23.95, ILL., 316 PAGES

<P>
 New York in the 1990s and the Dutch town of Haarlem in the early years of the 
17th Century coexist in this novel, unified by the powerful presence of the 
painter Frans Hals and the author's uncommon ease in two widely divergent 
worlds. Effectively using the classic device of setting a contemporary scholar 
to work on ancient journals, Michael Kernan introduces the reader to Peter Van 
Overloop, a bilingual graduate student stalled on his doctoral dissertation and 
eager to take on the job of translating a quartet of old diaries found in a 
Long Island hayloft. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavily wrapped and sealed, the moldering books bear the name Hals on the 
wrapping and seem to have been undisturbed since their arrival in New York a 
century ago, addressed to a long-vanished art gallery. If the cache is genuine, 
the owners have an immensely valuable treasure on their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Fooled before by skillful hoaxes, art experts are vulnerable and wary. While 
Peter is translating the books from Dutch to English, the art dealer who hired 
him is having the volumes studied and analyzed by scientists and academics, 
none of whom are willing to risk ignominy by hasty judgments. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter's personal story is a contemporary metropolitan saga, an almost 
archetypal tale of transient relationships, temporary jobs and haphazard living 
arrangements; the familiar tribulations of a young man in no particular hurry 
to find himself but aware that he should be. The Hals project is exactly what 
he needs -- a respectable excuse to postpone his thesis a bit longer; a 
diversion but not a complete tangent. He tackles the diaries with gusto, 
immediately drawn into the world of a gifted but underappreciated artist, 
identifying at once with his subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernan has thoroughly researched the relatively skimpy material available on 
Hals, assisted by the detailed catalogue prepared by the National Gallery of 
Art for its Hals exhibition in 1989. Although the purported diary entries are 
fictional, the names, places and events are historically accurate, drawn from 
the actual Haarlem town archives. While Kernan credits Simon Schama's 
definitive book "The Embarrassment of Riches: An Interpretation of Dutch 
Culture in the Golden Age" for much of the absorbing minutiae of daily life in 
17th-Century Holland, the vibrant personalities of Hals and the other central 
characters are essentially the author's invention. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisely, he has his translator, Peter, decide to turn the archaic diction into 
colloquial English, a decision that not only makes Hals immediately accessible 
to the reader, but reinforces the emotional connection between the contemporary 
art historian and the Renaissance painter. 
</P>
<P>
 Hals lived during a tumultuous social and political era, forever scrambling 
for the commissions that would enable him to provide for his enormous family, 
enduring the death of a beloved first wife and child, fathering nine children 
with his second wife, and finally achieving a modest prosperity only to see it 
all vanish when he allowed himself to be drawn into a widely speculative tulip 
scheme. He survived the plague that swept Europe during his lifetime, living to 
the then-rare age of 85 and working until the end with his loyal Lysbeth still 
at his side. 
</P>
<P>
 Wonderfully imagined and meticulously described, the story throbs with 
vitality and warmth, the mundane background details providing perspective to 
precisely the sort of candid, revealing portraits that Hals himself painted. We 
meet Hals in taverns, join the family for meals, accompany him on his frequent 
appearances in court, feel his guilty passion for a beautiful, talented 
student, share his anguish at the misfortunes of his children, and revel in his 
hard-won triumphs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although perfectly satisfactory, the denouement to the modern story seems 
almost anticlimactic. As far as the reader is concerned, the diaries are 
genuine. Reading them, we're transported 300 years back in time, to the Golden 
Age of Dutch painting, and it doesn't matter much what the expert analysts say 
about the paper, the ink or the existence of some lost Hals landscapes.

MAN ARRAIGNED IN LAGUNA FIRE BUT GUILT IS DOUBTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOREEN CARVAJAL and MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 26-year-old man was arraigned Monday on charges of setting last year's 
devastating Laguna Beach fire, but a few hours before the proceeding Orange 
County investigators had acknowledged to a Mexican prison warden that they 
believe the man was imprisoned in Mexico when the fire was set. 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing prison logs, medical records, photographs and fingerprints, as 
well as interviewing the man's cellmates and prison guards -- who were shown 
the man's photograph -- one of the investigators remarked, "We are talking 
about the same person," said Olga Leticia Aguayo, the director of the prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Maurice Evans said investigators are 
still looking into the alibi of Jose Soto Martinez, 26, who was imprisoned in 
Mexico under the name of Jaime Saille Higuera. Despite the latest developments, 
Martinez was arraigned for allegedly setting the fire, which damaged or 
destroyed 441 homes and caused $528 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 District attorney's officials said that, after conferring with their 
investigators in Mexico, they tried unsuccessfully to postpone the arraignment 
at which Martinez was formally notified of the charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said he expects a decision to be made this week on whether to drop the 
Laguna Beach arson charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Information has come to our attention, since we filed the case, indicating 
that perhaps Mr. Martinez did not set the fire and was in prison in Mexico. We 
are investigating Mr. Martinez's alibi," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing in Municipal Court in Laguna Niguel on Monday, the man known to 
Orange County authorities as Martinez entered a plea of not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 At the arraignment, Deputy Public Defender Jim Egar, representing Martinez, 
angrily denounced law enforcement officials for repeatedly interrogating the 
defendant without having present -- or even notifying -- his attorney. Egar 
said Martinez has had an attorney since Sept. 20, after his arrest in 
connection with arson fires in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez's Mexican prison record was confirmed just four days after Dist. 
Atty. Michael R. Capizzi, Orange Fire Chief Larry Holms and other law 
enforcement officials held an elaborate press conference to announce that they 
had captured the man who "willingly and maliciously" set one of the nation's 
costliest fires. 
</P>
<P>
 News that Martinez may no longer be a suspect in the case upset Laguna 
residents and prompted criticism of the district attorney's office for filing a 
criminal complaint before it had thoroughly investigated the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's looks like they were a little premature," said Deputy Public Defender 
Frank Ospino, who is also representing Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez became a suspect in the Laguna fire after he was arrested Sept. 16 on 
suspicion of starting three fires in Fullerton. Martinez told investigators he 
lit the Fullerton fire as well as other "big fires," including the Laguna 
blaze. He said he started the Laguna fire to commune with a demon god named 
Gotam. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Martinez's confession seemed bizarre, investigators said they took 
him seriously because of detailed information he gave about the fire. Martinez 
led investigators to the exact flash point of the blaze and told them that no 
accelerants, only matches, were used, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi announced at Friday's press conference that prosecutors had ample 
evidence against Martinez and that they were "comfortable" they had the man 
responsible for the fires. 
</P>
<P>
 But the case against Martinez started to unravel less then 24 hours later when 
his mother, Teresa Campos, said her son confessed to the crimes because he was 
afraid that he had been marked for death by Mexican mobsters and because he 
suffers from mental problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos, who lives in Fullerton, said she could have proved to authorities that 
her son had an alibi, but she was not contacted by law enforcement officials 
until Saturday, after charges had been filed and the press conference was held. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos had contacted Fullerton police Sept. 19 to tell them that her son, 
whose real name she said is Jaime Saille, was missing. She gave police a 
photograph of her son, but they did not immediately make the connection that 
the man she said was Saille was the man they had in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 District attorney's officials said they first became aware of the alibi after 
Campos was quoted on the incident in local newspapers. Saturday, two Orange 
County investigators questioned Campos for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, two Orange County investigators spent almost four hours in the 
Mazatlan prison in search of information to verify or disprove Campos' claim. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of the time, they huddled in the office of Aguayo, the prison 
director, who said the investigators compared the records of the man they know 
as Jose Soto Martinez with those of Jaime Saille Higuera. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigators showed Aguayo a grainy photograph of a sullen, unsmiling 
Martinez, whom Aguayo said she immediately recognized as her former prisoner 
named Saille. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Saille was a petty thief who had been jailed from May 15, 1993 -- 5 
1/2 months before the Laguna fire -- until July 8, 1994 -- 8 1/2 months after 
the fire. He had been convicted of a residential burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Aguayo, prisoners from Saille's cellblock told investigators 
that the man in the photograph was the same quiet prisoner who had lived among 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never gave us a problem. He was very tranquil," said the prison's 
commander, Marduk Urenda, who said Saille was the kind of prisoner who avoided 
fights. 
</P>
<P>
 When Saille first arrived in the prison in 1993, he underwent a medical 
examination and a doctor noted in prison records Saille's complaint about being 
haunted by ghosts and spirits. According to Aguayo, the medical report also 
indicated that Saille said he had been a drug user since age 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Saille never tried to escape from the prison, which holds about 1,080 
prisoners, Aguayo said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she is convinced that Saille could not have slipped out of the jail 
to California, because of the daily system of checking prisoners in the morning 
and evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the Laguna fire charge against Martinez is dropped, he will still face 
charges of setting three fires in Fullerton, district attorney officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of kind of closing the chapter (on the fire) was somewhat of a 
consolation. And close to the anniversary date, it would have been nice," said 
Laguna Beach Mayor Ann Christoph. But if Martinez could not have started the 
fire, "it's probably good to find out right now rather than later," she said.

ESPY QUITS AMID PROBE OF ETHICS; CABINET: SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE FACES 
ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSING PERQUISITES OF OFFICE. HE APPARENTLY HOPED TO SPARE THE 
ADMINISTRATION EMBARRASSMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy resigned abruptly Monday, apparently hoping to 
spare the Clinton Administration the embarrassment of an independent counsel's 
investigation of allegations that he abused the perquisites of office and 
improperly accepted sports tickets and trips from businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy's surprise decision to step down by Dec. 31 ended prematurely the 
once-promising tenure of the Administration's youngest Cabinet appointee and 
the first African American to serve as agriculture secretary. With the 
departure of Defense Secretary Les Aspin, Espy becomes the second Clinton 
Cabinet official to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision also proved to be a humiliating admission of defeat for the 
energetic young Espy, who had vowed to survive what he claimed were politically 
motivated and unsubstantiated allegations that he violated ethics laws by 
accepting the hospitality of such companies as Tyson Foods of Arkansas, Quaker 
Oats of Missouri and Sun Diamond of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, The Times has learned, another Clinton Cabinet official whose 
actions are under scrutiny, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G. 
Cisneros, has told White House officials that he is willing to step down, too, 
if the Justice Department determines that he misled the FBI before his 
appointment about payments in excess of $200,000 to a former woman friend. She 
has alleged that Cisneros agreed to pay the money to help alleviate damage to 
her career as a result of a romantic relationship between them some years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy, 40, a former Mississippi congressman, announced his resignation at a 
hastily scheduled news conference and insisted that he had not been asked to 
step down by the President or any other White House official. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was my choice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, his resignation came as the White House counsel's office was 
completing work on an internal review of the Espy matter that apparently 
uncovered reasons to challenge the agriculture secretary's contention that he 
had done nothing wrong. Among other things, the White House inquiry uncovered a 
previously unknown $1,200 "scholarship" that Pat Dempsey, a woman friend of 
Espy's, received from Tyson Foods. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said that White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta and White House 
Counsel Abner J. Mikva briefed Espy last Friday on the preliminary results of 
their review and gave him until Monday to decide how to respond. They were said 
to have left little doubt that they wanted him to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want this to linger," said a senior official, adding that White 
House officials were determined in this case to avoid the criticism they had 
received for failing to obtain the prompt resignation of Deputy Treasury 
Secretary Roger C. Altman after he was accused of lying to a congressional 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement accepting Espy's resignation, the President said he was 
troubled by the appearance of conflict of interest created by Espy's acceptance 
of favors from industry sources and he concluded that the secretary's 
resignation was suitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last few weeks . . . the Office of the White House Counsel has 
reviewed information about Secretary Espy and the actions he took while in 
office," Clinton said. "Although Secretary Espy has said he has done nothing 
wrong, I am troubled by the appearance of some of these incidents and believe 
his decision to leave is appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet because Espy's resignation does not take effect for three months, Clinton 
will not be forced to face the politically sensitive task of selecting a 
successor until after the November election. Among the contenders to succeed 
him are Ruth Harkin, wife of Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), and Robert Rominger, 
former California agriculture secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 While Espy's resignation spares Clinton the political damage of having a 
sitting Cabinet member under a cloud, it nonetheless does nothing to limit 
Espy's own legal liability. The investigation of Espy will continue under 
independent counsel Donald C. Smaltz. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, Smaltz is investigating Espy's acceptance of lodging at 
the picturesque Tyson Management Center after a speech to the Arkansas Poultry 
Federation and his return trip to Washington aboard a Tyson corporate jet. 
Dempsey accompanied him on that trip and also enjoyed the Tyson company's 
hospitality. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Espy and Dempsey attended a National Football League playoff game 
as guests of Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
 For Clinton, the allegations against Espy related to Tyson Foods were the most 
politically volatile. The President has often been accused of accepting favors 
from the head of the corporation, Don Tyson, a prominent Democrat in Clinton's 
home state of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, some critics claim that while Espy was accepting personal favors 
from Tyson Foods, his department was slow to act on proposals to improve 
poultry industry inspections -- a charge the secretary has vehemently denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyson Foods issued a statement Monday reiterating "that our contacts with the 
secretary were handled appropriately and that at no time did we ever seek 
special or preferential treatment from anyone at the USDA." 
</P>
<P>
 Espy's support at the White House apparently dried up a few days ago when his 
lawyer, Reid Weingarten, told Clinton's lawyers belatedly about the Tyson 
"scholarship" for Dempsey. He insisted that she obtained the money without 
Espy's assistance but White House officials concluded that it had the 
appearance of an illegal indirect favor to Espy. 
</P>
<P>
 Dempsey is said to have received the $1,200 last fall from a foundation run by 
Tyson, even though Espy has said that he discouraged her at the time from 
taking it. She recently returned the money after Espy's ethics came under 
scrutiny, according to one official. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy has contended that agribusiness gifts to Dempsey did not violate the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other potential ethical violations being investigated by Smaltz: 
</P>
<P>
 * Espy's alleged request to Quaker Oats to provide him tickets to a Chicago 
Bulls National Basketball Assn. playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 * A lavish birthday party for Espy co-hosted by his old college friend, 
Richard Douglas, a senior vice president of Sun Diamond, a company that 
benefits from the millions of dollars spent by the Agriculture Department to 
promote U.S. products overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 * A lucrative Agriculture Department contract given to Patricia Jensen, a 
friend to Douglas. Douglas and Jensen are known to frequently socialize with 
Espy and Dempsey. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dempsey's employment by a firm that frequently lobbies the Agriculture 
Department for agribusinss clients. 
</P>
<P>
 * At least 20 trips that Espy made at government expense to his home state of 
Mississippi during his first 20 months in office and his decision to charge the 
government for the lease of a Jeep Cherokee that he drove when he was in 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 While federal ethics laws prohibit all Cabinet members from soliciting 
gratuities or accepting gifts that might influence them in their official 
capacity, Espy, as agriculture secretary, is also bound by the even more 
restrictive provisions of the Meat Inspection Act. Enacted in 1907, that law 
prohibits officials with responsibility for overseeing meat inspections from 
accepting any gratuity such as travel accommodations or sports tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Rominger, an Espy deputy, and Harkin, who heads the Overseas 
Private Investment Corp., other potential candidates to replace Espy include 
Rep. Kika de la Garza (D-Tex.), chairman of the House Agriculture Committee; 
Rep. Jill Long (D-Ind.), Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) and Rep. Mike Synar 
(D-Okla.), who recently lost renomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Long and Harkin were passed over for the job in January, 1993. Rominger, a 
former California farmer, is said to be under consideration because of 
California's political importance to Clinton. De la Garza, if chosen, would be 
the first Latino agriculture secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Cisneros, sources said he has told White House officials, "if push 
comes to shove, he's not going to resist" efforts to persuade him to resign. 
The Justice Department initiated an investigation recently after Linda Medlar, 
his former woman friend, released tapes of telephone conversations in which he 
suggested that he had misled the FBI about the nature of the financial payments 
when agents investigated his background before his nomination in early 1993.

U.S. REVERSES POLICY, RAIDS HAITI MILITIA HQ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH FREED and MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American soldiers backed by tanks and heavy machine guns Monday raided the 
offices of a paramilitary group that had terrorized downtown Port-au-Prince in 
recent days while U.S. troops looked on without interfering. 
</P>
<P>
 But they interfered Monday, and in force. 
</P>
<P>
 Reversing a policy that law-and-order matters would be left to the Haitian 
military and police, American commander Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton sent U.S. troops 
in shortly before 10 a.m. to the cheers of fast-gathering crowds that soon 
numbered in the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 Guided by a red smoke marker, hundreds of armed assault troops of the 10th 
Mountain Division, along with at least five Sheridan M155 tanks, rolled up in 
front of the Normandy Bar, which is part of a three-building complex on the Rue 
Champs de Mars that serves as the downtown office of the Front for the 
Advancement and Progress of Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Commonly called FRAPH, the group was created and is armed and directed by 
Haiti's military. According to diplomatic and intelligence sources, FRAPH, 
which first appeared in August, 1993, has been a civilian cover for the 
thousands of killings, beatings and other brutalities committed against foes of 
the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The Normandy Bar, notorious as a thug recruitment hall, was the center of 
street fighting from Wednesday until Saturday between FRAPH members and 
demonstrators celebrating the scheduled return of exiled President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 At least six people were killed near the FRAPH office during the fighting, 
which was ignored by the 20,000 American troops sent here to establish order 
for Aristide's return and take power from the military regime that has ruled 
Haiti since taking over Sept. 30, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no FRAPH separate from (army commander Lt. Gen. Raoul) Cedras and 
(Police Chief Michel-Joseph) Francois," said one Haitian political source. 
"They kill on their orders and they sit at the Normandy on their orders." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the two dozen or so men and women playing dominoes and drinking raw 
rum on the porch of the tattered white and blue Normandy Bar, and in the 
abutting two-story office building, offered any resistance. All were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. troops confiscated some weapons, including three guns pulled from one 
woman's underclothes during a search by a female American soldier. 
</P>
<P>
 Also arrested, at least temporarily, were seven Haitian policemen who had 
answered a distress call from the FRAPH members and confronted the U.S. forces 
with guns at the ready. Those Haitians, who earlier had been described by 
Shelton as responsible for maintaining order in the FRAPH neighborhood, were 
disarmed and let go. 
</P>
<P>
 About two hours after the raid began, the Americans rolled up the razor wire 
used to keep the crowds at bay and began pulling out. The demonstrators hugged 
the departing Americans, exchanging high-five signs and shouting, "Liberty, 
Liberty! Good job, good job!" 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as the tanks and troop transports were out of sight, the cheers turned 
to howls as the crowd, now a mob, began what is known as dechoukaj . A Creole 
word that means roughly "uprooting," dechoukaj in Haiti connotes total 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. troops knew what was coming. One well-dressed woman edged up to an 
American sergeant. "You shouldn't let them do this," she said. "They'll destroy 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 The sergeant, his face red from the sun and his uniform soaked from sweat, 
looked at her. "Maybe they'll learn next time not to shoot their own people," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior commanders at the scene indicated they expected the throng that 
gathered outside their perimeter to set upon the building the moment they left. 
They left anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Another sergeant said his commanders wanted the people "to vent a little." 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a feeling this might happen, but we got to get them back to minding 
their Ps and Qs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly 40 minutes between the departure of the raid force and the arrival 
of a small American military police detachment that came to restore some order, 
the mob surged into the buildings with a furious joy. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd broke everything in sight, tearing out air-conditioning units, 
carrying out photocopying machines, splintering furniture and shattering every 
window. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of the MPs stopped the dechoukaj . 
</P>
<P>
 By late afternoon, all the U.S. troops were gone, but 1,000 or so Haitians 
milled about in front of the gutted Normandy, spitting on FRAPH literature and 
stomping on flyers showing the pictures of Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier and his 
son, Jean-Claude, leaders of a dictatorial family that ruled Haiti for nearly 
30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Army intelligence officers said most of those arrested Monday were involved in 
the street battles and that at least one took part in killing two of the six 
people who died in the FRAPH fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Army unit raided a second FRAPH office in the huge slum neighborhood 
of Carrefour on the southern edge of Port-au-Prince. The office was vacant and 
no arms were found. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the two raids accomplished little: Few arms were found, and while 30 
members of FRAPH were arrested, its leaders were not detained. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the head of FRAPH, a fast-talking, gap-toothed former civilian 
intelligence adviser to Cedras named Emmanuel (Toto) Constant -- who once 
confirmed to The Times that he was at the beck and call of the military -- was 
busily giving interviews to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "All FRAPH members are Haitians. We are not dogs. How could they treat us this 
way? We are Haitians too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also argued that "FRAPH is a political party, not a paramilitary group," 
adding that he had ordered his followers to dispose of all their weapons when 
the American troops began arriving Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any weapons found in the downtown headquarters belong to the military who go 
to the Normandy. I don't hide no heavy weapons," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent of the moves against FRAPH, weapons searches continued at several 
homes throughout the city. At most of the search sites, Army dog teams and 
weapons specialists were backed by tanks and armor, and they drew crowds 
throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no announcement of the total number of weapons found Monday, but 
earlier Shelton said about 4,000 arms of various types had been obtained since 
his troops landed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a briefing just before the FRAPH raids, Shelton said an American soldier 
stationed at the southern town of Les Cayes had been wounded in the abdomen 
Sunday night when he was attacked by two armed men outside his quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified Special Forces soldier shot back and may have wounded his 
assailants, Shelton said, adding that the American was hospitalized but would 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
 The FRAPH operation was a step away from the original U.S. policy that 
American forces were not to carry out police duties during their stay in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Shelton said Monday that "categorically no" mistakes were made last 
week in not stopping the FRAPH members from attacking pro-Aristide 
demonstrators, he said the Haitian police and soldiers had not done their job. 
</P>
<P>
 He continued to insist that even with "the more aggressive attitude" his 
troops would show now, the ultimate job of police work would have to come from 
a retrained and reformed local police force. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of that plan, teams of international police monitors, clad in bright 
yellow caps and armbands, were deployed at police stations throughout the 
capital for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Monday, about 60 monitors had arrived from a group that its head, former 
New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, said ultimately will number as 
many as 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the command of American forces, the monitors from Argentina, Bolivia, 
Jordan, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and the United States are to train a new 
police force and prevent human rights abuses and excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fool's mission to expect overnight changes," said Hugh Wright, a 
retired U.S. Army master sergeant attached to the monitor group. "But, in the 
long run, there's a very good chance this mission is going to work out very 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright said his mission is to observe, teach and prevent loss of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't come down here to become a Haitian police officer," he said. "We're 
not an occupation force. We never intended to be an occupation force."

BATTLE LOOMS ON CHEMICALS THAT DISRUPT HORMONES; SCIENCE: RESEARCH FINDS 
THREATS AT LEVELS ONCE THOUGHT SAFE. CLEANUP OF DDT OFF PALOS VERDES IS PART OF 
DEBATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After waiting nearly two decades to cleanse their lake-shore harbor of a 
million pounds of toxic waste, the people of this working-class suburb of 
Chicago were ready to party. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting sail on Lake Michigan aboard a cruise ship aptly named Celebration, 
local, state and federal dignitaries proclaimed the elaborate $21-million 
cleanup of Waukegan Harbor officially complete this summer. The marina -- for 
years stigmatized as the PCB contamination capital of the world -- was declared 
safe for everyone who works and plays there. 
</P>
<P>
 But the celebration may have come too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Compelling new scientific evidence has emerged indicating that low 
concentrations of pesticides and industrial chemicals once thought to be 
harmless can alter the hormones of wild animals, confusing their sexual 
identities and rendering them infertile. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat from these decades-old chemicals -- most notably massive amounts of 
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the Great Lakes and DDT off the shore of 
Los Angeles -- has stoked a long-smoldering environmental debate: How clean is 
clean? 
</P>
<P>
 For years, how much pollution to remove from severely contaminated spots has 
been based largely on a single target -- reducing the cancer risk to humans. 
But that may not be enough to defend bald eagles, trout, alligators and other 
animals from chemicals that imitate estrogen or block testosterone in the womb. 
Humans who eat contaminated fish and other food harvested from these areas also 
could be passing subtle reproductive problems such as low sperm counts to their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "In spite of government regulations and testing -- which we all thought was 
adequate in all honesty -- we are now finding effects that are much more subtle 
and much more intergenerational than we thought," said Tim Gross, a University 
of Florida endocrinologist who discovered part-male, part-female alligators and 
turtles in a Florida lake contaminated with DDT from a 1980 spill. 
</P>
<P>
 The concern over environmental hormones comes at a crucial time. In Southern 
California, federal officials are grappling with how to eliminate -- or more 
likely contain -- 4 million pounds of the pesticide DDT dumped several decades 
ago in ocean waters off the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, dozens of waterways from Washington's Puget Sound to South 
Florida's canals remain polluted with PCBs, compounds used as industrial 
insulators and lubricators, or DDT, even though they were banned in the United 
States in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to address this enormous legacy," said Michael Gilbertson, a 
biologist with the International Joint Commission, a U.S.-Canadian government 
panel helping guide cleanup of the Great Lakes. "How are we going to come to 
terms with all these dump sites? What this work on estrogens shows us is we 
have a very long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Eliminating the potential for hormone-like effects is shaping up to be a 
political struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of even a basic cleanup job runs in the tens of millions of dollars 
and the projects take years. Expanding the scope to tackle lower concentrations 
of chemicals would push the price up and take even more time. Beyond that, 
raising new health and ecological concerns could cast a pall on a community's 
businesses and recreation, especially sport fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a legitimate question to ask how much it is going to cost and what are 
the benefits," said John McCarthy, vice president for science and regulatory 
affairs at the American Crop Protection Assn., which represents Dow, Monsanto 
and other major pesticide producers. "I know it's not popular to talk about 
economics when you're talking about health risks, but you've got to get real 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 Dealing with the legacies of the past, however, is only one contentious aspect 
of the battle emerging over environmental hormones. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid saddling future generations with new problems, the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency and the chemical industry are wrestling with whether to 
restrict some of today's chemicals. About 25 popular insecticides, herbicides 
and fungicides -- applied on millions of acres every year in the United States 
-- have been shown in laboratory tests to imitate estrogen or inhibit 
testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
 Included are many pesticides, such as atrazine, endosulfan, EBDCs, parathion 
and dicofol, that help farmers protect and grow bountiful harvests of fruits, 
vegetables, grains and other crops worth billions of dollars annually. Some 
also are widely used for eliminating garden pests and weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven industrial compounds -- such as nonylphenol, used in plastics and 
detergents; styrene, an ingredient of rubber; and dioxins, a widely dispersed 
pollutant from paper mills and other manufacturing plants -- are suspected of 
causing problems as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the lessons we learned from DDT is that it is very hard to correct an 
error once you make it," said Dr. Lynn Goldman, assistant EPA administrator, 
who heads the Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances. "If you 
allow the use of a harmful compound . . . even after you take corrective 
action, you can see harmful effects for many years." 
</P>
<P>
 Several environmental groups already are demanding a phaseout of chlorinated 
pesticides and other compounds, many of which are identified as man-made 
hormones. But manufacturers are urging the government to await clear scientific 
findings, which could take the National Academy of Sciences several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a fair amount of advocacy science going on out there on this 
subject, and a lot of dueling Ph.Ds. Let's take a look at the science and do 
this right," said McCarthy of the crop association. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, the EPA plans to propose new rules requiring manufacturers to test 
pesticides to determine their potential for disrupting the endocrine system 
that controls hormones, Goldman said. For example, manufacturers may have to 
check the testosterone of exposed rodents, or use a newly developed method of 
checking whether breast cancer cells, which are sensitive to estrogen, grow in 
test tubes when exposed to a pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it comes to non-pesticide chemicals -- including some used in 
plastics -- the government has much less authority, Goldman said. Under federal 
law, the EPA must first prove a chemical poses a likely public health risk 
before companies can be ordered to enhance testing. That, Goldman said, is a 
Catch-22 that could allow most industrial chemicals that alter hormones to 
escape tougher restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a very good ability to predict which chemicals are likely to be 
endocrine disrupters," said Goldman, a former California epidemiologist and 
pediatrician. "That puts us at a great disadvantage. There are 70,000 chemicals 
on the inventory and of those, about 18,000 are of potential concern because 
they are in commerce to a significant extent." 
</P>
<P>
 Today's pesticides must be screened by their manufacturers on laboratory mice 
to gauge their risk of cancer, birth defects and reproductive effects. But they 
are not subjected to specific tests detecting hormonal changes. "Things can 
slip through the net," Goldman said, "and one of those things that can easily 
slip through are endocrine disrupters." 
</P>
<P>
 Each pesticide undergoes a "two-generation reproduction study," which exposes 
rats to various doses of chemicals in their food and then examines the 
offspring, and their offspring. But chemical industry officials acknowledge 
that the test is not sensitive enough to detect all troubling side effects. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, in the case of a fungicide named vinclozolin, tests by the 
manufacturers, BASF Corp. and Grace-Sierra Crop Protection, did not discern 
reproductive defects in rats. But when the EPA performed more thorough tests, 
it found that the fungicide blocks the formation of testosterone in rodents and 
that offspring were born with half-male, half-female sex organs. 
</P>
<P>
 Toxicologist Chris Chaisson of TAS Inc., which designs tests for chemical 
manufacturers, said traditional two-generation studies often cannot detect 
malformed genitalia because the rats are exposed to fairly low doses of 
chemicals. She said the search for more reliable methods "is a huge issue 
internationally." 
</P>
<P>
 After testing pesticides, the EPA decides on a case-by-case basis whether the 
risk is great enough to impose new restrictions -- "from changing instructions 
about how they are used all the way to suspension and cancellation," Goldman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers say they will not oppose new testing requirements. But they are 
bracing for battle if such tests lead to new bans or severe restrictions on 
chemicals that they say are necessary to protect the nation's food supply from 
pests and weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not like a situation where we have to shut whole industries down 
because something terrible is happening to the environment," McCarthy said. "It 
doesn't mean that we should be insensitive, and it doesn't mean we shouldn't be 
vigilant. But I don't think the environment is unraveling." 
</P>
<P>
 Some pesticides have been indicted as hormone disrupters on the basis of 
results in test tubes or, as in the case of vinclozolin, fairly large doses fed 
to mice. But the true test, said pesticide industry consultant James Lamb, is 
to learn if the chemicals harm people or animals in amounts now in the 
environment, and if the risk is great enough to outweigh the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because something causes a problem in a test tube doesn't mean it poses 
a significant risk," said Lamb, a reproductive toxicologist formerly with the 
EPA. "That kind of test is very limited." 
</P>
<P>
 While a ban on all hormone disrupters is highly unlikely, some could face new 
restrictions or reformulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to get rid of pesticides or plastics in our society," said 
David Crews, a zoologist at the University of Texas, Austin. "We will not allow 
loss of our quality of life. So we need to find out how to deactivate them or 
contain them so they don't have these impacts." 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, wildlife experts and industry agree on one point: No chemicals used 
today are as dangerous as DDT and PCBs, which accumulate in the environment and 
in body tissues and can reach poisonous levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new chemicals are entirely different," said McCarthy of the pesticide 
industry group. "Most are biodegradable. That's going to be a key difference in 
this whole debate." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of the nation's waterways have improved since the banning of DDT 
and PCBs, wildlife officials say buildup in many harbors, rivers and other hot 
spots remains severe enough to maim, kill or sterilize wild animals, especially 
fish-eating birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Along many Great Lakes' shorelines, bald eagles -- a threatened species -- 
still fail to reproduce and some cormorants are born with malformed, twisted 
beaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the political and financial ramifications, performing adequate cleanup 
has proved to be technically difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Waukegan Harbor -- on the nation's Superfund list of toxic 
sites named priorities for cleanup -- the EPA took 12 years to reach agreement 
with Outboard Marine Corp. to pay for removing 1 million pounds of PCBs the 
boat manufacturer had dumped into the lake in the 1960s. It took five more 
years for the agency to design a strategy, remove and treat some waste, and 
bury the rest in a boat slip walled off from the rest of Lake Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the $21-million effort -- which the EPA says removed 96% of the PCBs 
-- a sister federal agency, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, maintains that 
the water is at least 100 times too contaminated to safeguard fish and birds, 
including some endangered and threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
 "A safe level of contamination? We're light-years away from that in any of the 
Great Lakes," said David Best, a biologist for the wildlife agency's Midwestern 
region who is exploring the impact of Great Lakes contamination on bald eagles. 
"There is no biologist that would say (Waukegan) harbor is clean enough to 
ensure the health of fish and wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA allowed PCBs to remain in the harbor's sediments in concentrations as 
high as 50 parts per million, far greater than the 4 p.p.m. that kills a bald 
eagle's eggs. The Fish and Wildlife Service recommended cleaning the harbor to 
a level of 0.05 p.p.m., but the EPA rejected that option as impractical. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times EPA and state regulatory agencies feel if they get it up to 
human health standards, that's enough for wildlife," said Donald Steffeck, 
chief of contaminants for the wildlife service's western region. "But those 
cormorants or ospreys or eagles are out there 100% of the time eating those 
fish." 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to Waukegan Harbor to dredge more waste is considered unlikely, 
given the realities of money, politics and public sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 Local residents generally are pleased and their harbor is more popular than 
ever because the water looks dramatically cleaner after the dredging and PCB 
concentrations have dropped. "Nobody worries about PCBs anymore," said one 
local Coast Guard auxiliary officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just don't want to know the truth," said Charles Facemire, an 
environmental toxicologist with the wildlife agency. "It scares the pants off 
them, especially this issue of endocrine disruption and how your children could 
be born with reproductive problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbertson of the International Joint Commission said the EPA and state 
regulators overseeing cleanups have been "terribly slow" in realizing that 
potential reproductive damage to wildlife and people is important when setting 
cleanup goals. The EPA is much more focused on reducing human cancer risk from 
eating fish and on the outright mortality of animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the only consideration was to protect wildlife, that (harbor cleanup) 
would not be enough," said John Giesy, a Michigan State University fisheries 
and wildlife professor. "But that was purely a societal decision, a risk 
management decision. EPA felt it was a decision they could live with." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman, one of the highest-ranking officials at the EPA, acknowledges that 
her agency should focus more on protecting the health of natural resources when 
regulating chemicals and cleaning up toxic waste. But she blames the failing on 
a need for better science to predict ecological impacts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The criticism is well-taken," she said. "In the absence of better tools, we 
go with the things we do know, like cancer. What is new is this general 
recognition of the connection between risks to wildlife and the risk to human 
health." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman warned, however, that excavating old pollutants such as DDT and PCBs 
from the bottom of waterways sometimes can lead to more contamination of the 
fish. "It may be that the best possible thing is to leave them buried," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to tackling these hormone-disrupting pollutants, the nation's 
most massive problem lies in Los Angeles' own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1950 to 1970, DDT manufacturer Montrose Chemical Corp. of Torrance dumped 
several million pounds of the pesticide into county sewers that flow into the 
ocean off the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Due to a human cancer threat, warnings 
already have been posted on the peninsula and at Los Angeles Harbor advising 
against eating croaker and other fish caught close to shore. 
</P>
<P>
 Their eggs poisoned by DDT, populations of brown pelicans, eagles and other 
birds plunged in the 1970s. Although most now appear to be recovering, 
scientists say fish and wildlife still are suffering some lingering 
reproductive effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Specific scientific evidence of the damage, however, has been kept 
confidential by U.S. Justice Department attorneys, who are suing Montrose and 
other industries to seek compensation for wildlife and habitat losses. The 
federal government is soon expected to announce a proposal for restoring the 
coastal resources that is bound to be costly. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, no one wants to repeat the mistakes that left such enduring 
environmental dilemmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Industry has suffered greatly from DDT and other things that have come back 
to haunt them," said Glen Fox, a Canadian government biologist who has studied 
the impacts of Great Lakes pollution for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "They cannot afford to ignore a problem with a chemical that could affect your 
reproduction or your children's reproduction. They are so scared spitless of 
that sort of thing. If there was ever an issue industry would probably act on, 
it's this one." Anatomy of a Cleanup 
</P>
<P>
 Cleaning up Waukegan Harbor, on Lake Michigan 35 miles north of Chicago, 
illustrates the difficulty of handling sites contaminated with toxic chemicals. 
After years of dumping by Outboard Marine Corp., the harbor had the worst 
contamination from polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, in the United States. 
The $21-million cleanup, a high priority in the Superfund program, began in 
1988 and was completed in 1993. Here is a look at how the process was 
accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 1. One million pounds of PCB-laced sediment and soil were dredged from Slip 3 
-- the main source of PCBs in the harbor -- as well as Crescent Ditch and North 
Ditch. 
</P>
<P>
 2. The materials were pumped into a holding pond and dried in West Containment 
Cell. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Almost 13,000 tons were cooked at high temperatures in a mobile processor 
at the West Containment Cell that separated the PCBs from the sediment and 
concentrated them the PCBs in an oil-based liquid. The liquid was hauled to an 
incinerator in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Slip 3 was turned into a huge containment cell to permanently hold 
untreated soils and sediments dredged from the harbor. The idea is to prevent 
lake water from flowing in. 
</P>
<P>
 SLIP 3 CONTAINMENT CELL 
</P>
<P>
 * A 290-foot cutoff wall was built at the mouth of the slip to cut it off from 
the rest of the harbor. The wall consists of two steel sheets 20 feet apart and 
anchored 7 feet deep into the clay layer. 
</P>
<P>
 * A large slurry wall, 3 feet thick, was connected to the cutoff wall to 
enclose the remainder of Slip 3. 
</P>
<P>
 * An underwater layer of hard, silty clay was added between the steel sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 * Steel braces were placed every 30 feet along the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 * A rock berm was constructed diagonally to the cutoff wall, extending 40 feet 
along the floor of the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Hydraulic dredging removed 32,000 cubic yards of contaminated sediments 
from the upper harbor floor. The material was pumped into an intake pipe and 
discharged into the containment cell at Slip 3. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Two smaller containment cells were built to permanently hold wastes from 
the North Ditch and the treated sediment from the mobile cooking process. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Water in the cells was continuously monitored by wells. A water-treatment 
plant was built to clean any polluted water extracted from the cells. 
</P>
<P>
 8. A new boat slip was constructed in the harbor to replace the old one. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Once the sediments settle, Slip 3 will be sealed. Disruptive Potential 
</P>
<P>
 About 45 pesticides and industrial chemicals disrupt hormones in laboratory 
tests, which means they have the potential to cause reproductive disorders in 
wildlife or people. Here are some in volume produced annually in the United 
States.

<P>
 It was an astonishing sight, even in the new South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Three white policemen, symbol of the worst of apartheid, were driving an 
armored vehicle in Radebe, one of the most dangerous "no-go zones." It was 
deserted but for burned-out shops, bullet-riddled homes and the sad debris of 
years of township war and neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, a dozen black men emerged from an alley. In the van, Sgt. Willie 
Naude grabbed his rifle and peered out a gun port. He tensed for an attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it happened: The group smiled and waved. The surprised police waved back 
and stopped. A lanky youth with scars on his face walked up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Always, when we see police before, we run away," explained Abel Mbena. "Now 
we don't want a misunderstanding. Things have changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Warrant Officer Danie van der Berg grinned. "It's kind of amazing. People say 
it's nice seeing the police." 
</P>
<P>
 Five months after a historic election ushered in South Africa's first 
black-led government, attitudes are changing in battle-weary townships where 
police were the enemy and urban war was a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Trust is still tenuous. Many police oppose reform, and many militants reject 
the rule of law. But the new constitution requires community policing, and 
blacks are starting to provide what long seemed impossible -- oversight of the 
long-hated police. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my whole lifetime, I only went into a police station when I was being 
arrested," laughed Sipho Tshabalala, a dapper 49-year-old insurance broker who 
heads the new Katlehong community policing forum. Convicted of sabotage, he 
served eight harsh years on Robben Island with a far better-known prisoner, 
Nelson Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
 Now president, Mandela is being feted this week in New York and Washington. 
From Wall Street to the White House, he hopes to persuade skeptical business 
leaders that it is safe to invest in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 But law and order is elusive back home. Political violence fell sharply after 
the election but is rising again. And murder, rape, carjacking and most other 
reported crimes are at record levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Even police aren't immune: 189 officers have been killed so far this year, 
half since the election. Last year, 271 were slain. 
</P>
<P>
 The legacy of apartheid is largely to blame. Paramilitary police enforced 
injustice and bigotry for decades and ruthlessly repressed dissent with a 
network of informers and vicious anti-riot squads. 
</P>
<P>
 Top officials sanctioned assassination and other terror tactics to maintain 
the authoritarian state. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-apartheid struggle, in turn, led to a culture of violence and 
contempt for the rule of law. Self-styled vigilante squads took over townships, 
targeting rivals and police and forcing thousands of families to flee. Consumer 
boycotts and strikes were used as political weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a nightmare like Katlehong, a bleak, treeless township on the 
East Rand outside Johannesburg. Most of the estimated 500,000 residents live in 
matchbox homes, dilapidated migrant hostels or squalid squatter camps. 
Unemployment is rampant, schooling is dismal, violence is endemic. 
</P>
<P>
 Katlehong last year racked up 1,058 homicides, the highest murder rate in 
South Africa. Most victims were shot or burned to death in the bitter political 
and criminal wars that racked the ghetto. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, by comparison, had 1,076 homicides in a population more than 
seven times as large. 
</P>
<P>
 But Katlehong has only one police station. And the 319 uniformed officers -- 
including dispatchers, clerks and other posts usually held by civilians in the 
United States -- share 15 vehicles and one incoming phone line. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone is always busy, complained Meverett Koetz, a community activist. 
"And people are dying." 
</P>
<P>
 Such problems are typical. Although most crime is in townships, 80% of the 
police stations are in white areas, home to only 15% of the population. And 
while 60% of the patrol force is nonwhite, nearly every officer is white. 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse, brutal police abuses are still widespread. The Independent Board 
of Inquiry, a church-backed human rights group, is investigating more than 100 
alleged torture cases since the election just in the Vaal Triangle, a cluster 
of townships south of Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
 "Torture is routine," said Sally Sealey, the board's senior researcher. "It 
happens every single day. It's the only way police know to investigate and get 
confessions. It's the same in the new South Africa as it was in the old." 
</P>
<P>
 Torture is no longer official policy, of course, and police insist they are 
cracking down on misconduct. But like many things involving police here, ending 
abuses remains more a goal than a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the government plans to merge the 115,000-member South African 
police with the country's 10 other police services, a widely disparate array of 
segregated forces from the former black homelands. 
</P>
<P>
 Sydney Mufamadi, minister of safety and security, has pledged that the new, 
130,000-member force will function as a "legitimate and popular police 
service," with heavy emphasis on community policing in high-crime areas. 
</P>
<P>
 But legislation to create the force isn't likely to pass Parliament before 
May. Part of the problem is trying to integrate 11 separate bureaucratic and 
logistic systems, as well as pay scales and promotion policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Another obstacle may be harder to overcome: police resistance to reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "To a large extent, the police force is a totally intact force that was 
inherited from the previous government," said Melanie Lue, coordinator of the 
Policing Research Project, an independent group at the University of the 
Witwatersrand. "As a result, the new government must tread very lightly." 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Johan van der Merwe, the holdover commissioner of police, concedes the 
revamping is going slowly. "We are trying to speed up the process to end the 
uncertainty," he said. "It obviously affects the morale of our members." 
</P>
<P>
 But more than morale needs repair. Experts say the police must undergo a 
psychological shift to change their racist culture and military structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the years of apartheid, they were the masters, not the servants. That kind 
of thinking isn't going to change overnight," warned Chris Boetha, a former 
police captain who now teaches at the University of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police have to know that the right of protest is protected by law," he added. 
"They've been taught that protesters are the enemies of the state. . . . We've 
never been an open and free society. We've got to teach police what an open and 
free society really is." 
</P>
<P>
 But except for the name -- the South African Police is now the South African 
Police Service -- Boetha sees little real change. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commissioner is the same," he said. "The general staff is the same. The 
brigadiers, colonels and most station commanders are the same. If your 
recruitment hasn't changed, if your training hasn't changed, if your command 
hasn't changed, how can you expect police operations to change?" 
</P>
<P>
 A recent night with police in sprawling Soweto, the country's largest 
township, showed the steep challenge ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing really changed except the government, really," said police 
Capt. Sarel Coetzee, head of the "flying squad" quick-reaction force, as he 
patrolled the dark, deserted streets. "We're still doing the same job." 
</P>
<P>
 He said his men have had no training on detailed provisions in the new 
constitution and bill of rights for protection of human rights and civil 
liberties. "The only training we get is experience," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 So they had no search warrants, as required by law, when they burst into two 
homes, guns drawn, looking for suspects. Nor, as the law requires, did they 
warn two men arrested later for car theft that they had the right to remain 
silent and the right to ask for a lawyer and that anything they said could be 
used against them in court. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither did anyone ask to see warrants, charges or even identification. 
"They are police," said one man, puzzled when asked why he allowed officers to 
search his home and frighten his family. It turned out that the cops, who never 
explained their presence, were in the wrong house. They left without a word. 
</P>
<P>
 Such behavior infuriates Tshabalala, head of the Katlehong policing forum. He 
mans a desk each morning at the police station to hear complaints and arranges 
weekly meetings between civilians and police brass. At a recent Saturday 
morning session, he said public education is desperately needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our people should know that police can't come into their homes anymore 
without a search warrant," he said. "All we know is they come in our homes and 
do whatever they like. They don't identify themselves or tell you your rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Tshabalala clearly knows his rights: The local police chief was transferred 
after he refused to cooperate with the forum. 
</P>
<P>
 But the forum itself is in trouble. There is no money to pay members, and 
interest is low. Only 40 of 150 people invited showed up for the special 
Saturday session. The regular meeting, several days later, was canceled when no 
one came. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are signs of progress. For the first time, residents have begun 
reporting crimes and identifying suspects to police. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were scared to be seen talking to the police before," said Lt. Jeshop 
Shabangu, head of the 15-member murder unit. "If you did, you were a sellout to 
the enemy. And eventually you were a target." 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Phillip Mokoena, who heads the new community relations office, sees the 
shift in attitudes when he goes to high schools to talk to students. "In the 
past, I would not even enter the school premises, no less address them," he 
said. "Now I don't wear a bulletproof vest, use an armored vehicle or carry a 
weapon. I am showing them that I can trust them and they can trust me."

HARRIET NELSON, MATRIARCH OF TV FAMILY, DIES AT 85 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART and DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harriet Nelson, whose transition from Ozzie Nelson's band singer to his wife 
and then mother of their two sons transformed her into the matriarch of one of 
television's most wholesome and beloved families, has died. She was 85. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Nelson died of congestive heart failure Sunday afternoon in her Laguna 
Beach home with her son, David, and his wife, Yvonne, at her bedside. 
</P>
<P>
 "David was holding her hand," her daughter-in-law said. "She fell asleep and 
passed away peacefully." 
</P>
<P>
 The demure and highly respected Mrs. Nelson, once America's favorite 
housewife, had lived in quiet retirement for many years. She had remained 
generally out of public view since her husband's death from cancer in 1975 and 
the 1986 air crash that claimed her other son, Rick, a popular rock 'n' roll 
performer long after "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" went off the air. 
Her rare public appearances late in life could force some comedians to clean up 
their tawdry material out of respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Nelson had been admitted to South Coast Medical Center in Laguna Beach in 
late August suffering from congestive heart failure and had long battled 
emphysema. Unknown to her many fans, she had smoked cigarettes for years. She 
was released from the hospital Friday at her request, after her condition was 
reported stabilized. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked last month if she were in good spirits, her son David replied: "She 
hasn't been in good spirits since Dad died." 
</P>
<P>
 With Ozzie as the helpful, willing but sometimes befuddled husband and Harriet 
as his knowing, soft-spoken spouse who never strayed far from the kitchen, the 
Nelsons became a weekly symbol of a simpler, gentler America. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet," which began on radio in 1944 and aired 
on television from 1952 to 1966, is the longest-running family sitcom in TV 
history. In the process of producing 435 episodes, the Nelsons became an 
American institution. 
</P>
<P>
 In a New Yorker cartoon from the 1960s, a middle-aged couple is shown watching 
television when the wife tells the husband: "I'll make a deal with you. I'll 
try to be more like Harriet if you try to be more like Ozzie." 
</P>
<P>
 Two decades after the show was canceled, people would still approach Harriet 
and say, "Aren't you Ozzie and Harriet?" She would always laugh and say, "Well, 
I'm one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Harriet Hilliard, born Harriet Louise Snyder in Des Moines, Iowa, was the 
daughter of theatrical parents who plied the Midwestern theater circuit. She 
made her stage debut at the age of 6 weeks when her mother carried her on stage 
in "Heir to the Horrah" and had her first speaking role when she was 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Following her mother to New York after her parents separated, Harriet quit 
high school three months shy of graduating to join the Corps de Ballet at the 
Capitol Theater on Broadway. In 1927, when she was 17, she was hired by 
vaudeville comic Ken Murray to be his straight woman. For the next year, she 
worked with Murray and danced in the Harry Carroll Revue, the first vaudeville 
unit to go out on the Radio Keith Orpheum circuit, playing two shows a day. She 
later worked as straight woman for comedian Bert Lahr and played the Palace 
Theater four times. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1931, Harriet was hired to do a specialty dance act at the Hollywood 
Restaurant, one of Manhattan's top nightclubs. She was soon serving as mistress 
of ceremonies and working in production numbers at the club. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, Ozzie Nelson hired her to be the vocalist with his popular dance 
band. They were an instant hit with the young Westchester, N.Y., crowd during 
their first engagement at the famed Glen Island Casino. There, they began doing 
humorous duets, which Ozzie wrote, and it was not long before they became a 
couple off stage as well as on. They were married in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
 Harriet made her motion picture debut in "Follow the Fleet" with Ginger Rogers 
and Fred Astaire in 1936. Although she appeared in several other pictures over 
the next few years, her priority was being with Ozzie and starting a family. 
</P>
<P>
 Having grown up in show business, she once said, "I know there's one thing 
that's important and that's your family." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Ozzie and Harriet achieved their greatest early success on radio, 
beginning with their regular appearances on comic Joe Penner's "Baker's 
Broadcast" out of New York in the early 1930s. In the early '40s, Ozzie, 
Harriet and the band joined Red Skelton's new radio show in Hollywood. Harriet 
sang on the show and worked with Skelton in comedy sketches. She played Daisy 
June opposite Red's Klem Kadiddlehopper, Calamity Jane opposite his Dead-Eye 
and the mother of Junior, "the mean widdle kid." 
</P>
<P>
 When Skelton was drafted into the Army in 1944, the Nelsons began their own 
radio show. "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" began as a day in the life of 
bandleader Ozzie Nelson and his vocalist wife, Harriet Hilliard. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, the radio series featured child actors because the patriarch said 
he "didn't want any inflated egos at the dinner table." But in 1949, Ozzie -- 
who wrote much of their material himself -- gave in and with Harriet's 
blessings let the boys portray themselves, which they continued to do on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Many reflected that the only things that really changed when the Nelsons 
switched mediums were the voices of Dave and Rick. 
</P>
<P>
 On both radio and television, Ozzie portrayed the stubborn husband and father 
who tried to persuade his wife that men were superior by nature, both 
physically and mentally. She was the forbearing spouse who never argued but 
always proved him wrong, in one way or another. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the radio Nelsons, their TV counterparts increasingly became embroiled 
in the growing pains of the two boys. Rick went from a kid with a crew-cut 
haircut to a singing idol. The more staid David attended law school and went 
into practice. And when they both married in real life, their wives were 
brought into the show. 
</P>
<P>
 The closeness that Americans sensed from their favorite TV family was not 
coincidental. The Nelsons themselves were described as a tightknit, loving 
bunch who never let their show business success cripple their home life. 
</P>
<P>
 Harriet Nelson liked to tell of the time her then teen-age grandson, Sam, once 
the subject of a bitter custody battle between Rick Nelson's in-laws and Rick's 
widow, Kris, told her, "Grandma, this (the Laguna property) is the nicest house 
in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Later her granddaughter, actress Tracy Nelson, explained to her what her 
brother had meant: 
</P>
<P>
 "You're a constant to us," she said. "No matter what comes and goes, you're 
always here." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, Ozzie and Harriet -- their children now grown and on their own -- 
returned to TV with a syndicated series called "Ozzie's Girls" in which they 
took in two college women as boarders. David Nelson produced the half-hour 
series but Ozzie became ill and it survived only one season. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a memento of sorts that remained from the show, however. It was a 
framed photo of the Nelsons, taken shortly before they married in 1935. The 
picture rested atop an antique oak table in the Laguna Beach home where Harriet 
Nelson sought solace after her husband's death. 
</P>
<P>
 The frame was engraved: "Ozzie's Girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Nelson is survived by her son, David, nine grandchildren and one 
great-grandchild. At her request, a private memorial service will be held.

AFTER LATEST SLAYING, WEB OF INTRIGUE EMERGES IN MEXICO; CRIME: KILLING TIED TO 
FAMILY CONNECTIONS, DRUG LORDS AND GRUDGE. KINSHIP STILL A MAINSTAY OF NATION'S 
POLITICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The assassination of Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the No. 2 official in the ruling 
party, and the investigation of that crime on Monday graphically illustrated 
the complex web of kinship, friendship and patronage that typifies Mexican 
politics -- and appears to have mired prominent politicians in this country in 
the drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspapers here, for example, have reported that Congressman Manuel Munoz 
Rocha -- the highest-ranking politician implicated so far in the killing of 
Ruiz Massieu -- pleaded with federal police, as he tried to negotiate his 
surrender, to consider political and family ties that had drawn him into last 
week's bold daylight crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as this was occurring, members of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary 
Party, or PRI, sought to distance themselves from Munoz Rocha, the 
once-influential chairman of the Hydraulics Commission, which controls Mexico's 
dams -- meaning it has sway over critical areas such as hydroelectric power and 
water for irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We regret that this man (Munoz Rocha) was ever admitted to the ranks of our 
party, because he does not deserve to be part of the PRI," party Chairman 
Ignacio Pichardo told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, the attorney general asked Congress to revoke Munoz Rocha's 
legislative immunity so he can be prosecuted in the alleged plot to kill Ruiz 
Massieu. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said it could take from two weeks to a month to strip him of that 
legal protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are still hunting Munoz Rocha and others allegedly involved in the 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the slain man's family ties, that crime has now come to be seen as 
a personal attack on President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and, according to one 
suspect, an attempt to undermine Mexico's war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz Massieu was a former Salinas brother-in-law, and his brother, Mario, is 
the assistant attorney general who has led a fierce crackdown on narcotics 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 But that is just one of many tangled, almost soap-opera-style relationships 
that have come to the surface thus far in the assassination investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 According to news reports here, Munoz Rocha has links to Abraham Rubio 
Canales, a jailed politician with a grudge against Francisco Ruiz Massieu. The 
ties between these two are said to involve the dating relationship between 
Munoz Rocha's daughter and Rubio Canales' son. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, Rubio Canales reportedly was angry with Ruiz Massieu, believing he 
may have helped send him to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 And Rubio Canales has ties to suspected drug lords via another son's marriage. 
That son married the daughter of Raul Valladares; Valladares recently was 
arrested, and authorities have said they believe he is the No. 2 figure in the 
notorious Gulf cartel, which supplies as much as two-thirds of the cocaine that 
enters the United States from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 When Munoz Rocha turned to a trusted longtime aide for help in carrying out 
the killing, the aide enlisted his brother, according to the brother's 
statement to police. 
</P>
<P>
 The brother also told police that he, in turn, relied on a network of 
paisanos, old acquaintances from near his hometown, to buy guns and recruit 
triggermen. 
</P>
<P>
 Family ties "are extremely important, because Mexicans rely in the political 
world -- as they do in other worlds -- on trust," said Roderic Camp, a Tulane 
University political scientist who has written a book on political recruitment 
in Mexico. "One way to develop trust is to be related to someone. Society has 
not developed to the extent of trusting people on the basis of impersonal 
relationships." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Camp estimates that a third of the prominent politicians he has 
interviewed for several books on Mexico's political elite are related to other 
politicians who, in turn, have helped their careers. Salinas, for example, is 
the son of a former Cabinet secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Camp noted that his estimate of the ties between politicians is probably 
conservative, because it does not take into account links by marriage, which 
are harder to trace. 
</P>
<P>
 Family ties are crucial in state and local politics, he said -- even more so 
than at the national level, where the competition is stiffer. The reliance on 
family is also a point that distinguishes the "dinosaurs" -- the Old Guard of 
Mexican politics -- from the modern "technocrats." 
</P>
<P>
 "This shows that these people have old attitudes about everything," said 
Angeles Mastreta, author of "Mexican Bolero," a novel based on the web of 
family and politics in 1940s Mexico. "These are 1940s attitudes in the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
 While technocrats' relatives have been known to receive political 
appointments, other paths to power have opened in recent years, experts here 
said. Universities, for example, have become the most important new source of 
politicians, Camp said. 
</P>
<P>
 The old school tie, he noted, now is often reinforced with a traditional rite, 
compadrazgo -- becoming a godparent to a friend's child. The fundamental basis 
of academically linked relationships, though, remains the student-teacher or 
classmate bond. 
</P>
<P>
 Among city dwellers, private clubs also have become a way to forge links that 
can lead to jobs in government -- especially since memberships have become 
perks for top bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The new paths to power have gained in importance here as reformers have passed 
laws making it illegal for public servants to hire relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulations, however, have had a limited effect on preventing politicians 
from promoting godchildren's careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who prefer the old system appear to have found new, dangerous allies. 
What is most terrifying, said Mastreta, is "one politician threatening another 
with his relatives who are drug traffickers." 
</P>
<P>
 It is particularly striking that one victim of this new bonding may have been 
Ruiz Massieu, said Raymundo Riva Palacio, columnist for the independent 
newspaper Reforma. Ruiz Massieu was among those most critical of traffickers' 
efforts to penetrate politics, saying openly that one state governor and his 
alleged drug-dealer brothers "ought to be in jail." The Scorecard (Southland 
Edition, A14) 
</P>
<P>
 This is the cast of people in the alleged plot to kill reform-minded Mexican 
politicians: 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Ruiz Massieu: The assassination victim, who was the late general 
secretary of the Institutional Revolutionary Party and former governor of the 
state of Guerrero, and was slated to become majority leader in the next 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Ruiz Massieu: Francisco Ruiz Massieu's brother and the assistant 
attorney general in charge of federal anti-narcotics enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Aguilar Trevino: Alleged triggerman in the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Angel Cantu: Neighbor of Aguilar Trevino, who allegedly accompanied him 
to the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez: Suspect who allegedly detailed to police a plot to 
kill reform-minded politicians. He said that he bought the gun used in the 
killing and recruited Aguilar Trevino and Cantu. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez: Brother of Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez who allegedly 
identified Francisco Ruiz Massieu for Aguilar Trevino. Also a top aide to an 
important congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Munoz Rocha: The congressman Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez worked for. 
Police have requested the revocation of his congressional immunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Abraham Rubio Canales: Imprisoned former aide to Francisco Ruiz Massieu, 
political ally of Munoz Rocha and father-in-law of son of Raul Valladares. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Valladares: Arrested earlier this year by Mario Ruiz Massieu on drug 
trafficking charges. Believed to be lieutenant of Juan Garcia Abrego. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Garcia Abrego: Suspected head of the Gulf cartel, a cocaine smuggling 
ring linked to Colombia's Cali cartel. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Eugenia Ramirez Arau: Sister of Fernando and Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez, 
who is believed to have known about the plot. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Angel Ramirez Arau: Husband of Maria Eugenia, who lent his car to his 
brother-in-law, Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez, the day of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus Sanchez: Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez's driver, who was supposed to drive 
the getaway car, but panicked. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Pascual Alvarez: Municipal policeman from San Carlos, Tamaulipas -- 
county seat of Aguilar Trevino's hometown -- who allegedly sold the gun used in 
the slaying to Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez for 2,000 pesos, about $600, and an 
AK-47 for 4,000 pesos, about $1,200.

ECONOMIC REBOUND UNDETERRED BY QUAKE; BUSINESS: DUN & BRADSTREET SAYS L.A.'S 
RECOVERY CONTINUED DESPITE TEMBLOR. INSURANCE, U.S. PROVIDED BOOST.

 The Northridge earthquake could bust up freeways and shake apart shopping 
malls but apparently could not derail the recovering Los Angeles economy, which 
according to a Dun & Bradstreet study released Monday is stronger now than at 
the time of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one was more surprised than us," said David Kresge, the firm's senior vice 
president of analytical services. "But when you have this much data, you're not 
looking at an illusion." 
</P>
<P>
 Using proprietary credit and other financial information from more than 20,000 
firms located within 40 miles of the quake's epicenter, Dun & Bradstreet 
economists determined that the rate of local business failures -- which shot up 
during the recession from 1990 through 1992 and began to fall sharply near the 
start of 1993 -- has continued to drop through 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more surprising, Kresge said, was that the failure rate for businesses 
located within 20 miles of the epicenter is shrinking slightly faster than the 
rate statewide. The 20-mile area has about 177,000 businesses, employing 1.6 
million workers, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some $19 billion or more in insurance payments and federal aid is helping keep 
much of the local economy pumping, the report said. Dun & Bradstreet gathers 
business information, including credit worthiness of individual firms, for sale 
to business clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Other economic researchers, at UCLA and the Center for the Continuing Study of 
the California Economy, said the report is consistent with their research, and 
local business and political leaders found the upbeat data cheering. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is certainly the sort of thing we had hoped for, recognizing that the 
Los Angeles area has suffered a series of significant problems, economic and 
natural, as well as civil," said Ray Remy, president of the Los Angeles Area 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are poised for some good things to happen . . . not . . . the boom 
'80s, but definitely a better environment than we have seen in the last three 
or four years." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Leslie, Mayor Richard Riordan's deputy for economic development, called 
the report "good news," but added that while the overall economy is improving, 
"there is a select group of businesses that are disproportionately impacted, 
and they are mostly in the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than finding growing numbers of firms falling behind on their bills, 
the Dun & Bradstreet study found that among businesses within 40 miles of the 
epicenter, 16% strengthened their financial status despite the quake and 16% 
got weaker. Similarly, 13% of firms were recast as higher credit risks, while 
13% lowered their credit risk ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a wash from the point of view of the larger economy," Kresge said. 
"But, of course, if you are part of the percentage that got weaker it's not a 
wash at all. It is easy to get lost in the statistics and say, 'It's not so 
bad.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, the local economy kept right on the same track it was following 
before the quake hit, with business losses counterbalanced by other gains, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, for many businesses or individuals, the quake brought financial 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, despite the damage to tens of thousands of individual businesses and 
homes, Dun & Bradstreet analysts say the timely repair of roads and freeways, 
as well as the local economy's growing strength in the months before the Jan. 
17 quake, protected Southern California from much worse, long-term damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a fit trying to put this stuff together at first," said Kresge, a 
former Harvard economics professor. "I had expected to track how manufacturing 
got weaker and how many more businesses had failed, but then we saw the numbers 
and said, 'Hey, wait a minute, this is a different story.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The study confirms earlier assessments by economists from UCLA's Business 
Forecasting Project who have said the quake would have only a slight negative 
long-term impact on the Southern California economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings also are consistent with data collected by the Palo Alto-based 
Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy, said the center's 
director, Stephen Levy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big losses from the earthquake were in asset losses and wealth losses to 
people losing their homes or buildings, but not the disruption of the region's 
ongoing economic activity," Levy said. "People got wiped out of particular 
assets, but it didn't damage the region's economy. . . . So it is possible to 
have a severe earthquake, with great damage, without great disruption to 
everyday economic affairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's Dun & Bradstreet report contrasted sharply with grim predictions when 
the firm began its six-month study in the days following the quake. The firm's 
analysts had determined that more than one-third of California's manufacturing 
base was within 40 miles of the earthquake's epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturing is considered a key element of a region's economy because each 
dollar earned in salaries is exchanged several times throughout the community. 
</P>
<P>
 In telephone and door-to-door interviews in the days after the quake, Dun & 
Bradstreet workers in a preliminary tally found that one-fifth of the 3,000 
area firms most likely to have been hurt by the quake had suffered some kind of 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Of special concern were high-tech manufacturing zones in the northeast San 
Fernando Valley, which have a high concentration of the region's biomedical, 
computer hardware and aerospace subcontracting companies. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Kresge said, there were fears that the quake would push the Los 
Angeles area's economy into a "death spiral, where firms shut down, cash flow 
problems mount, there is no money for repairs and workers aren't getting paid." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the broken freeways, long detours and personal tragedies, "People 
kept coming into work and firms kept operating," Kresge said. ". . . And 
because businesses were able to operate, whatever damage they did have, they 
were able to pay for repairs with some cash flow. The economy was by no means 
crippled." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the quake damage reported by businesses, most turned out to be inventory 
losses and broken windows, the report said. Cited as examples are a Van Nuys 
marble wholesaler that lost $500,000 in shattered stone and a Sherman Oaks 
china store that sustained $100,000 in broken inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 The marble wholesaler is recovering with a federal Small Business 
Administration loan, and the china store owner was insured, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dun & Bradstreet study credits the infusion of insurance money -- 
estimated to be from $7 billion to $10 billion -- with keeping the doors of 
many damaged businesses open. Federal assistance -- which through various 
programs will amount to $12 billion -- also helped, but has been slower in 
coming, he said.

REQUIRING AID FOR HOPELESSLY COMATOSE UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court, acting Monday in a case that has alarmed emergency medical 
professionals, let stand a lower court ruling that requires hospitals to admit 
and resuscitate comatose patients, even when doctors say there is no hope for 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling grew out of the case of a baby born in 1992 in Fairfax County, Va., 
with most of her brain missing. Although she was deemed by doctors to have no 
chance of long-term survival, she was placed on a ventilator and has been 
repeatedly revived at her mother's insistence. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors disputed the wisdom of such aggressive treatment, but a divided U.S. 
appeals court ruled in February that federal law requires medical professionals 
"to provide stabilizing treatment" to a hopelessly ill patient, even when they 
"consider it morally and ethically inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for several national medical groups, who pressed the case before the 
high court, said that the ruling greatly expands the prevailing interpretation 
of a 1986 federal law that barred hospitals from refusing to treat poor 
patients. Unless overturned, it could require hospitals to treat dying patients 
of all ages aggressively, no matter what their chances of survival, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the matter of Baby K vs. Ms. H, 93-2076, the justices, without dissent, 
left standing the lower court ruling. In response, lawyers for the medical 
groups said that they will ask Congress to amend the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time to my knowledge that a court has ordered physicians to 
render medical care over their protests," said Stephan E. Lawton, an attorney 
representing the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Society of Critical 
Care Medicine. "Clearly, this is not what Congress intended, but the case is 
being cited now all over the country." 
</P>
<P>
 The high court's action Monday, the first day of its new session, does not set 
a binding legal rule. But as a practical matter, the precedent in the "Baby K" 
case is likely to be followed elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Often the justices refuse to take up an appeal unless the lower courts are 
split on the matter. Lawyers said that the ruling in Baby K's case marked the 
first time that the 1986 law had been deemed to mandate a level of medical 
treatment not recommended by doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. appeals court in Richmond noted that Baby K "lacks a cerebrum (and) 
is permanently unconscious." Doctors recommended that the baby be allowed to 
die peacefully, but the mother, citing her strong religious convictions, said 
she wanted "everything" done to keep her daughter alive. The baby continues to 
be cared for at a nursing home but has been returned to the hospital several 
times for resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is beyond the limits of our judicial function to address the moral or 
ethical propriety of providing emergency stabilizing medical treatment to 
anencephalic infants," wrote Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson for a 2-1 majority 
siding with the mother. "We are bound to interpret federal statutes in 
accordance with their plain language. The Emergency Medical Treatment and 
Active Labor Act does not carve out an exception for anencephalic infants in 
respiratory distress any more than it carves out an exception for comatose 
patients . . . who may repeatedly seek emergency stabilizing treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 Congress passed the 1986 law in response to reports that some private 
hospitals were rejecting poor patients, including pregnant women in labor. Now 
hospitals that receive Medicare money must provide emergency care and 
"necessary stabilizing treatment" to all patients who arrive in medical 
distress. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides in the Baby K matter agreed that money was not an issue in this 
case. An insurer paid the baby's medical costs, which were sealed and kept 
confidential. They disagreed, however, about whether doctors must provide 
aggressive treatment in hopeless cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baby K ruling "will have sweeping and unintended implications for clinical 
medicine," said lawyers for the hospital, if all "available technically 
feasible care will have to be provided to a dying patient upon demand. . . . 
This ruling has profound implications for the financing of medical care in this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 But a lawyer who represents the baby's mother said the judges correctly 
concluded that the final decision about treatment should rest with the family, 
not the doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hospital was trying to reverse 20 years of informed consent law," said 
attorney Ellen J. Flannery. "Rather than let the family or patient decide, they 
said that 'we, the hospital, can decide which cases are futile.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She cited the example of an AIDS patient who comes to a hospital with 
breathing difficulties. Doctors must try to revive such a patient, she said. 
"They can't say, 'We won't treat you because you are going to die anyway.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 20 years ago, the case of Karen Ann Quinlan, a comatose teen-ager from 
New Jersey, helped to establish the legal principle in most states that family 
members can end extraordinary treatment for hopelessly ill relatives.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; CLINTON IS THE HEADLINER FOR BROWN FUND-RAISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California Treasurer Kathleen Brown, seeking an infusion into her 
gubernatorial campaign treasury, attended a Washington fund-raiser Friday whose 
centerpiece was President Clinton, viewed by many Democrats as a drag on their 
election prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 While admitting that the White House may be of dubious value to some 
Democrats, Brown announced earlier Friday that Clinton is scheduled to headline 
a fund-raiser for her in California on Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are head winds that come from the difficulties that the Administration 
has been having. My sense is that those head winds are less strong in 
California than in other parts of the country . . . because I am running 
against an incumbent," Brown said at a luncheon with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest difference in my case is that I don't have an I (for incumbent) 
behind my name," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton had to cancel an earlier fund-raising event for Brown because of the 
Haiti crisis. Brown plans to visit New York today for additional fund-raising 
activities before returning to California. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said her internal polling showed that her campaign was behind Wilson's 
by about 6 percentage points, but was improving. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying her run for the Statehouse "will come to fruition" during the next four 
to five weeks, Brown declared that her Republican foe, Gov. Pete Wilson, is 
"eminently beatable." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am the clear alternative to a governor who has no agenda, other than a 
political agenda to get reelected," said Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Debunking reports that she is running low on funds, Brown said she had 
sufficient funds to meet her payroll "and advance her agenda and strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any financial problems more than usual, running against an 
incumbent governor who has every special interest in the state locked up," 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying people are fed up with Wilson's attacks on her in 30-second ads, Brown 
said she would woo voters by selling them on her 62-page plan, "Building a New 
California." Asked what media venues she would use, Brown would only say, "Stay 
tuned." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown downplayed the effect gender would have in the governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women broke through the gender barrier in '92 when California sent two women 
senators to Washington. Now it's what do you stand for," said Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there are unique problems for women running for CEO (of a state) that 
persist even in the face of breaking through the gender barrier . . . that 
relate to crime and financial management. Uniquely in my case, my track record 
as (treasurer) offers a trump card on the issue of financial management. 
</P>
<P>
 "Admittedly, on offense, I will never win the crime issue, but that was never 
part of my strategy. . . . My strengths will be the specifics of my plan, 
particularly on education, jobs, fiscal management," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said she is committing $7 million to voter-registration efforts, 
including get-out-the vote and vote-by-mail campaigns.

THERAPISTS TO TRADE TREATMENT FOR GUNS; VIOLENCE: PUTTING A NEW SPIN ON 
WEAPON-EXCHANGE IDEA, PSYCHOLOGISTS IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY SAY THEY CAN TEACH 
FIREARMS OWNERS TO COPE PEACEFULLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a novel attempt to slow the epidemic of violence in California, 
psychologists in Contra Costa County today will begin offering three hours of 
free therapy to anyone who turns in a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Following on the heels of successful gun exchange programs for cash, food, 
shoes, toys and concert and sports tickets, this is the first in the nation to 
trade psychotherapy for firearms. Call it guns for shrinks. 
</P>
<P>
 Initiated by psychologist David O'Grady, president of the 110-member Contra 
Costa Psychological Assn., the program is designed to aid gun owners who may be 
angry, depressed or suicidal. Grady said all of the association's therapists 
will participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people out there who know they have a problem with anger and 
sincerely want to learn new skills for dealing with it," O'Grady said. "There 
are people who own guns because they are afraid and want to find other means of 
coping with their fears." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Grady, who specializes in counseling teen-agers, said he started the program 
after an 18-year-old patient took a loaded Uzi to school and, in a separate 
incident, a 13-year-old client went to school with his father's loaded pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 The psychologist noted that the death rate from firearms in Contra Costa, a 
suburban county east of San Francisco, has risen 247% in the past decade. The 
county's population has grown by 22% in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials said they welcome the program and will participate by 
collecting weapons and issuing vouchers, which will be worth $300 in treatment 
at the office of any participating psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people who are looking at this as some kind of joke," said 
Concord Police Chief Michael Maehler. "That's not my feeling at all. If there 
is an opportunity to save some lives by having psychological services 
available, that seems like it's worth doing to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some exchange programs that have been restricted to handguns, the 
psychologists will accept any type of firearm. But clients will be limited to 
one voucher per person. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't finance an entire course of psychoanalysis with an arsenal," 
O'Grady said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three years, exchange programs in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New 
York and other major cities have netted thousands of firearms. Most recently, 
the Army began its own guns-for-cash program in Haiti as part of its effort to 
end violence there. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics have suggested that gun exchange programs are akin to emptying 
the ocean with a thimble. But advocates say the potential for saving even one 
life makes the programs worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 The Contra Costa effort differs from other programs by offering to teach gun 
owners peaceful methods of reducing stress, avoiding conflict and solving 
personal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Psychologists have developed effective methods to teach people real skills in 
dealing with anger nonviolently and these skills really should be made more 
accessible to the public," O'Grady said. "I have seen angry, destructive 
teen-agers change their behavior and learn to use words instead of fists and 
ideas instead of guns." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Grady said he hopes the offer will entice hundreds of people to turn in 
firearms. But he will consider it worthwhile if his group of psychologists gets 
just a handful of guns off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe this program can make a difference," he said. "Even if it is only 
as few as a dozen, we feel we will have made a contribution and we will avoid 
some heartbreaking tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the program's supporters are Contra Costa residents Stephen Sposato and 
Marilyn Merrill, who each lost a spouse last year when a gunman stormed a law 
office in downtown San Francisco and killed nine people. The effort also has 
the backing of 14 police chiefs in Contra Costa County and a variety of elected 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The psychological association cited research showing that 52% of gun deaths 
are suicides, 42% are homicides and 6% are unintentional. One recent study 
concluded that a gun in the home is 43 times as likely to kill a family member 
as to be used in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 People with a history of mental disorders are legally barred from purchasing 
weapons. The Contra Costa program attempts to reach gun owners who have never 
been diagnosed with psychological illness but may suffer from such problems as 
anxiety, fear or depression. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know in law enforcement that there are a lot of people who are in need of 
psychological services who seem to fall through the cracks," Chief Maehler 
said.

WOMAN WHO KILLED ABUSIVE MATE MAY BE FREED EARLY; BATTERED SPOUSES: GENEVA 
LOVE, WHO SHOT HER HUSBAND TO DEATH IN 1988, STRIKES A PLEA BARGAIN THAT MAY 
ALLOW HER TO LEAVE PRISON NEXT YEAR. SHE EARLIER HAD SOUGHT CLEMENCY FROM 
WILSON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A woman who had sought executive clemency after she killed her abusive husband 
struck a plea bargain Monday that reduced her 17-years-to-life sentence to 12 
years and probably will result in her release from prison sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Geneva Love, whose petition for clemency to Gov. Pete Wilson had been 
accompanied by a letter of support from the trial judge, will finish serving 
her sentence in the same Arkansas prison where she has been for more than four 
years, said her attorney, Christina Cordoza of Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
 Love, 29, shot her husband, a Ft. Ord soldier, in 1988, after what her 
attorney said was protracted abuse. Wilson, who last year considered more than 
a dozen petitions for executive clemency by women who had killed spouses they 
said were abusive, singled out Love's case, noting that her record "offers a 
sympathetic picture of petitioner, but does not produce an easy answer to the 
question of clemency in her case." 
</P>
<P>
 In the current matter, Monterey Superior Court Judge Richard Silver granted 
Cordoza's writ of habeas corpus, and attorneys worked out an agreement for Love 
on Monday to plead to voluntary manslaughter, instead of the second-degree 
murder charge of which she was convicted in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The plea agreement may free Love from prison sooner than clemency would have. 
Wilson's clemency grant to convicted spouse-killer Brenda Aris last year 
reduced Aris' minimum sentence to 11 years from 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Love was pregnant with her second child when she killed her husband, Azell. 
She gave birth to her second son in prison. Both children are in Arkansas, as 
are her 13 brothers and sisters, who have worked on her behalf, circulating 
petitions of support. An Arkansas state senator has taken up her cause, 
certifying that he will help her find a job and a home when she is released. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordoza's writ had said that Love's trial attorney should have tried to 
introduce evidence of battered women's syndrome and used an expert on the 
syndrome. The trial attorney agreed, said Cordoza. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, battered women's syndrome was still an unsettled area of law, 
allowed in some cases and not in others. Two years after Love was convicted of 
second-degree murder, the state evidence code was amended to allow testimony 
about the syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordoza says the trial judge, Robert M. Hinrichs of Monterey, had urged Wilson 
to grant clemency, writing that "if the evidence presented in the application 
had been presented at the trial, it is very likely that there would have been 
an acquittal instead of a conviction." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Dennis LaBarbera said Monday that "we would have had a very 
difficult time putting the case back together" for another trial, with so many 
witnesses scattered after the closure of Ft. Ord, where Love's husband was 
based. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a compromise," said LaBarbera. "They got something of what they 
wanted -- a reduction in the charge so she could get out earlier. We got 
something we wanted -- at least we preserved a conviction and some of the 
punishment she'd get for killing somebody."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; CLOSE-UP / THE '94 CAMPAIGN; DOG-EAT-DOG RACE SPAWNS 
FAXES THAT BITE

 It read more like a letter to Dear Abby than a piece of political propaganda. 
Under the heading "I NEVER THOUGHT YOUR STORIES WERE TRUE BEFORE, BUT AFTER 
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME THIS WEEK I CHANGED MY MIND," there was this: 
</P>
<P>
 So I met this really cool woman in the Capitol the other day. . . . Well, she 
kind of blew me off, but she did give me her home phone number. She's really 
smart, but I'm not sure if she's going to be employed much longer. What should 
I do? Sincerely, Sleepless in Sacramento.  
</P>
<P>
 Most Californians would have been baffled by this item in Schnur Shots, a 
weekly fax-letter penned by Gov. Pete Wilson's campaign spokesman, Dan Schnur. 
But the 160 reporters and political insiders on Schnur's mailing list knew 
exactly what he was spoofing: Kathleen Brown's recent well-publicized visit to 
Wilson's office, where she gave Schnur her phone number and demanded that the 
governor call her to talk about debates. 
</P>
<P>
 You've seen the television ads. You've heard the sound bites. But some of the 
most scathing and entertaining stuff of the 1994 campaign is not on the 
airwaves but on the fax machine. Lately, shiny-papered missives from the 
various camps are rolling off the printer at an alarming rate. These tip sheets 
are packed with sarcastic, self-serving and often hilarious commentary -- a far 
cry from the all-too-sober official countdown to Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 But chances are you'll never see them, because they aren't meant for you. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Why in a state of 17 million voters would a political campaign waste its time 
trying to amuse just a few hundred journalists and opinion-makers? With just 
five weeks to go before the Nov. 8 election, why would Schnur spend even a few 
precious moments writing about why Brown reminds him of Imelda Marcos? Or 
thinking up headings like: AS LONG AS SHE'S DROWNING, THROW HER AN ANCHOR? 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed an outlet," said the hyper, sharp-witted Schnur. But that's only 
part of the reason for Schnur Shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Another part is that it's a cheap way to get a campaign's message out -- if 
not to the masses, then at least to the people the masses are likely to listen 
to. Moreover, a fax-letter lacks the formality of a press release, allowing its 
author to gloat, scold, needle, nit-pick -- and, Schnur hopes, "plant the seed 
of an idea for a story or even for a question in a reporter's mind." 
</P>
<P>
 This ain't highbrow stuff. To command attention, Schnur irreverently alludes 
to nudie magazines, sports legends and O.J. Simpson's murder trial. (When he 
questions the veracity of a Brown statement, he files it under: KATO KAELIN 
MEMORIAL QUOTE OF THE WEEK). 
</P>
<P>
 In the view of the Brown campaign, Schnur's efforts are in bad taste. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dan has gone over the line," said Steve Glazer, a Brown aide who himself 
recently faxed two pages of what he called "snide and obnoxious comments" about 
Wilson. "This is about maintaining a sense of credibility with the press corps. 
Does that mean you can't be funny? No. But in my mind, (when) it becomes a cute 
way of insulting your opponent, that is destructive." 
</P>
<P>
 Lighten up, says the Wilson camp. "There's a big gulf between the news that a 
campaign can make by having a press conference or putting out a news release 
and what I would call the need for some regular background chatter about what's 
happening," said Larry Thomas, senior counsel to Wilson's campaign and one of 
three people who screen Schnur's raw prose to make sure it's appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schnur Shots is the '90s equivalent of hanging out at the press club in the 
'50s, going out and drinking beers with the guys on the campaign trail," said 
Thomas. "It's background noise." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown campaign makes its share of noise as well, though its occasional 
spin sheets lack a title and usually even a hint of humor. ("While Wilson's 
fiscal mishaps are sinking in," reads one, "Brown's been talking about her 
plan, 'Building a New California,' to turn things around.") 
</P>
<P>
 Though the news media is the primary audience for such barbs, there are other 
targeted readers for this campaign-sponsored wit. Darry Sragow, who authored 
the bitingly funny Garamendi Gram while he was managing Insurance Commissioner 
John Garamendi's gubernatorial campaign earlier this year, says he tried to use 
the campaign fax-letter to help his underdog candidate raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game here is to suggest that a challenger is viable," Sragow said, 
recalling the way the Garamendi Gram used to poke fun at the Brown campaign. 
"If the insiders didn't believe that the Brown campaign was flawed, then it 
would (have been) much more difficult for us to be able to raise the money we 
needed to be able to affect the perceptions of non-insiders -- real voters." 
</P>
<P>
 Faxes can also be used to mess with a rival's head. Though no campaign puts 
its opponent on the mailing list, all campaigns assume the enemy is reading 
every word. "You very definitely want your opponent to see these things," said 
Sragow, whose most memorable Garamendi Gram announced that Brown had quit the 
race (it was dated April Fools' Day). "That's part of the reason you put them 
out -- to drive them crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sragow didn't invent the form. He got the idea from Otto Bos, the late Wilson 
adviser who faxed out a tip sheet called Otto Graphs during the 1990 
gubernatorial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Otto got the first spin of the day," Sragow said admiringly. "This is the 
throw-a-bunch-of-marbles-down-in-your-opponent's-path strategy. They can step 
around a few of them, but inevitably they will slip and fall. That's what these 
(faxes) are: little marbles." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the faxes get personal. After Brown press secretary John Whitehurst 
suggested that First Lady Gayle Wilson, who had criticized Brown, had been 
"unleashed like an attack dog," he became Schnur Shot material. The comment, 
Schnur wrote, was "just a totally inappropriate, nasty, ugly, disgusting and 
potentially misogynistic put-down by a pathetic waste of skin." 
</P>
<P>
 But usually, glibness prevails. Often Schnur will excerpt newspaper articles, 
then invent what he imagines to be a voter's reaction. The San Jose Mercury 
News, for example, quoted Brown as saying the key difference between herself 
and Wilson was "the hope thing. Hope is a really different thing. Pete Wilson 
is a joyless person." 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur's imaginary voter responded this way: "Y'know Marge, I think Pete 
Wilson's better on crime and jobs and immigration. But that Kathleen Brown just 
looks so darn joyous! And so hopeful!! I think I'll vote for her instead." 
Political Scorecard

 35 days to go before Californians go to the polls.

<P>
 THE GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, appearing in Fresno, offered again to meet Democratic 
nominee Kathleen Brown in a one-hour debate at a Sacramento public television 
station on Oct. 14. Brown aides reiterated their position that Brown would only 
debate if the event is carried on a network of commercial stations in prime 
time. Thus there was no change in the deadlock that led each side to conclude 
last Friday that there will be no debates. Brown met with reporters at a 
luncheon in Washington and attended a Democratic governors fund-raising dinner 
featuring President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: 
</P>
<P>
 The governor addresses the third annual Gov. Pete Wilson Conference for Women 
at the Long Beach Convention Center and then holds campaign news conference. 
Brown goes from Washington to New York City for more fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SENATE RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 Both U.S. Senate candidates -- Rep. Mike Huffington and Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
-- were in Washington, where Congress is in session. Feinstein's campaign 
released a new television commercial attacking Huffington's background in 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates today will remain in Washington. Huffington's wife, Arianna, 
speaks at a women's political conference in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 NOTABLE QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
 "When men and women go into the dry cleaners to pick up their shirts, they 
should pay the same price. That comes down to fairness, pure and simple." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kathleen Brown, saying she would have signed a bill -- vetoed by Wilson -- 
that would have banned gender-based price discrimination.

TALKS MAY SET STAGE FOR CLINTON TO VISIT CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton welcomed Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, to the White 
House on Monday and other U.S. officials met with Chinese counterparts in what 
appeared to be a broad effort to clear the way for a possible Clinton visit to 
Beijing next year. 
</P>
<P>
 A China sojourn by the President -- complete with pictures of Clinton shaking 
hands with leaders like hard-line Premier Li Peng -- would be the capstone to 
China's largely successful five-year effort to regain international legitimacy 
after the brutal 1989 Tian An Men Square crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last few weeks, the Chinese press and Chinese officials have been 
floating the idea that Clinton may visit China. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, soon after Qian met with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, he 
raised the issue, the secretary said. U.S. officials have denied the President 
will visit this year but have not ruled out the possibility of a trip next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Clinton's one-hour meeting with Qian, the White House issued a 
statement saying China and the United States had made significant progress "in 
some areas" over the last year. But the statement said "the President expressed 
disappointment" about the lack of progress on human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Qian, who is also a vice premier, told reporters that relations 
between the United States and China are at a "critical" juncture, suggesting 
the ties could get much better or much worse. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, Clinton Administration officials seem to be trying to use the 
possibility of a presidential visit as leverage to extract policy changes from 
China on a series of issues, including arms proliferation, trade and human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 There were signs late Monday that Chinese and American officials are moving to 
resolve a long-running dispute over China's sales of M-11 missile parts to 
Pakistan. China has refused to discuss the sales, which seem to violate the 
international regime on missile technology, unless the United States explains 
the George Bush Administration's decision to sell American F-16 warplanes to 
Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.S. official said there had been "some progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Shen Guofang, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, told a news conference 
Monday that Christopher "did not mention" the case of Wei Jingsheng, China's 
best-known proponent of democracy, who was imprisoned last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. official insisted that Wei's case had been brought up in Christopher's 
meetings with Qian. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese Vice Justice Minister Zhang Geng was quoted today as saying that Wei 
will be shown around China's boom regions "to see the progress of the 
motherland." His release from jail depends on his behavior, Hong Kong 
newspapers quoted Zhang as saying.

BOOK DESCRIBES ALLEGED AFFAIR BETWEEN DIANA, ARMY OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sensational new book purporting to reveal a long, intimate love affair 
between a handsome army officer and the Princess of Wales went on sale in 
Britain on Monday and was an immediate sellout at 75,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial book, written by journalist Anna Pasternak, is based on what 
Pasternak learned during a two-year friendship, she says, with 36-year-old 
James Hewitt, a retired captain in the elite Life Guards of the Royal Household 
Cavalry. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, "Princess in Love," has few quotations and is written in the 
breathless style of romantic fiction, containing the supposed thoughts and 
feelings of Princess Diana and Hewitt during a torrid love affair that lasted 
nearly five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Diana, spurned by Prince Charles, was desperate for affection, attention and 
sexual love, according to the book. She is depicted as making love to the tall, 
blond Hewitt in her four-poster bed at Highgrove, Charles' country estate, with 
her two sons asleep in the next room. 
</P>
<P>
 The affair reportedly ended in 1991. Since then, Hewitt has sold his story to 
the tabloids, though until now he had denied that he was intimate with Diana. 
Hewitt reached the rank of temporary major but was forced to retire earlier 
this year as a captain when he failed his tests for promotion to permanent 
major. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasternak, a great-niece of the Nobel Prize-winning Russian writer Boris 
Pasternak, writes of the couple's first dinner date, at Kensington Palace: 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly, she could bear it no longer. Her need was too much, she was 
starting to flail. So, with the ease of a dancer performing a well-worn 
routine, she stood up, walked across to him and slipped sideways on to his lap. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Diana stood up and without saying a word stretched out her hand and slowly 
led James to her bedroom. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The 192-page book -- written and printed in secret, apparently to avoid a 
court injunction against it -- has outraged Buckingham Palace, where it was 
branded "grubby and worthless." 
</P>
<P>
 In a television appearance Monday, Pasternak, 27, said her material came from 
Hewitt and from letters he received from Diana, now 33, particularly while he 
was serving as an acting major with a tank squadron during the Persian Gulf 
War.

SPEECH BY PRESIDENT MANDELA IS A SIGN OF VICTORY FOR U.N.; SOUTH AFRICA: 
GENERAL ASSEMBLY HAD BATTLED APARTHEID SYSTEM, NOW GONE PARTLY BECAUSE OF THAT 
PRESSURE. NEW LEADER VOWS TO ATTACK COUNTRY'S RACISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Symbolizing one of the great triumphs of the United Nations, Nelson Mandela 
addressed the General Assembly on Monday for the first time as president of 
South Africa and pledged to wipe out racism in his divided country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The road that we shall have to travel to reach this destination will by no 
means be easy," he told the General Assembly. "All of us know how stubbornly 
racism can cling to the mind and how deeply it can infect the human soul. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . And yet however hard this battle will be," he went on, "we will not 
surrender." 
</P>
<P>
 The symbolism for the United Nations was clear. For decades, the General 
Assembly had mounted a vigorous campaign against the racist apartheid system of 
South Africa and its imprisonment of Mandela, the country's most prominent 
African nationalist leader. The relentless campaign, which prompted many 
countries to impose sanctions, made South Africa a pariah among nations and 
contributed to the atmosphere that finally persuaded its white leaders to give 
up apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations focused on Mandela from the start. In 1963, months before 
he was convicted of "sabotage" for his anti-apartheid agitation and sentenced 
to life in prison, the General Assembly passed a resolution calling on South 
Africa to abandon the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his release from prison in 1990, Mandela, 76, has spoken to the United 
Nations twice. But this visit was his first since his election as president in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking slowly in booming tones, Mandela, dressed in a gray suit, said that 
the historic change in South Africa "has come about not least because of the 
great efforts in which the U.N. engaged to ensure the suppression of the 
apartheid crime against humanity." 
</P>
<P>
 "The millions of our people," he went on, "say thank you and thank you again 
that the respect for your own dignity as human beings inspired you to act to 
ensure the restoration of our dignity as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela began his speech by noting that "it surely must be one of the great 
ironies of our age that this august assembly is addressed, for the first time 
in 49 years, by a South African head of state drawn from among the African 
majority of what is an African country." 
</P>
<P>
 While pledging that he and his people intend to create "a truly non-racial 
society," Mandela said their success would "depend on our ability to change the 
material conditions of life of our people so that they not only have the vote, 
but they have bread and work as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Without being specific, Mandela said his country needs outside help. He 
repeated this later at a 40-minute news conference, telling reporters he was in 
the United States to "ask the Americans to throw their markets open to South 
Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he went on, "I'm not coming here with cap in hand. I'm coming here as a 
representative of a sovereign and proud country. I don't want charity. . . . 
But investment in South Africa will be of mutual benefit to the United States 
and the people of South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that South Africa especially wants "investors to enter into 
partnerships with black business." 
</P>
<P>
 In other business, a special commission on human rights accused elements of 
the Hutu majority in Rwanda of genocide in trying to wipe out the Tutsi 
minority "in a concerted, planned, systematic and methodical way" after the 
president died in a plane crash in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also concluded that both the Hutu government forces and the 
Tutsi-dominated rebels who now run Rwanda were guilty of "crimes against 
humanity" from April to July. But the commission said it had no evidence that 
Tutsis tried to commit genocide.

POLITICS; N.Y. GOVERNOR'S CONTEST SHAPING UP AS LIBERALISM'S LAST STAND; 
SEEKING HIS 4TH TERM, MARIO CUOMO IS RUNNING THE RACE OF HIS LIFE. HIS IDEOLOGY 
AND RECORD ARE KEY CAMPAIGN ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, one of the last surviving icons of American liberalism 
and a man many Democrats had thought surely would one day lead their party from 
the White House, today is battling to save his political career from 
extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 At 62, Cuomo is regarded outside New York as the last governing liberal, the 
leading torch-bearer for what remains of that once politically potent faith in 
the problem-solving abilities of activist government. 
</P>
<P>
 But at home, as he seeks a fourth term in Albany, he is in danger of being 
driven from public life by a little-known Republican state senator named George 
Pataki, whose principle strength appears to be that he is not Mario Matthew 
Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
 A direct heir to the New Deal philosophy that an earlier New York governor, 
Franklin D. Roosevelt, used to define the modern Democratic Party, Cuomo 
reflects in his own background and beliefs the diverse alliance of social and 
ethnic groups that dominated big-state politics for more than a generation. 
</P>
<P>
 But these doctrines and forces are in decline in New York as almost everywhere 
else. Not only have many voters grown cynical about the problem-solving ability 
of government, many now care more about making the society around them safer 
than about making it gentler. And the old alliance of labor unions, immigrants, 
ethnic groups and liberal intellectuals has lost political cohesion and 
crusading energy. 
</P>
<P>
 The result for Cuomo has been a sharp slide in popular support. A new poll 
released last week by the widely respected Marist Institute of Public Opinion 
showed Cuomo trailing Pataki by 44% to 38% among registered voters. That 
amounts to nearly a statistical dead heat because the poll has a sampling error 
of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, but it still represents a stunning loss 
of support for Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as troubling from the governor's point of view, the survey of 900 
registered voters showed that Cuomo's approval rating in the state he has 
governed since 1982 is barely above 30% and that three of five New Yorkers 
believe their state is headed in the wrong direction. 
</P>
<P>
 So the contest here shapes up as liberalism's last stand. And Cuomo's 
Republican foes view him as a sort of latter-day Gen. George Armstrong Custer, 
who is about to lose his political scalp. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to win the race on Nov. 8 and there is going to be no fourth 
term for Mario Cuomo," Pataki told a boisterous crowd of about 300 GOP 
loyalists in Hicksville in Nassau County recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the Democrats where I work are going to vote for Pataki," claimed one of 
the guests, Beatrice Larucca, from nearby Levittown, who is collections manager 
for a bank. "They want the death penalty," she said, referring to Cuomo's 
longstanding opposition to capital punishment, which Pataki advocates. "And 
they are just tired of Cuomo." 
</P>
<P>
 Exacerbating Cuomo's problem is continued anxiety about the state's economy. 
Despite the gains made in the last 18 months as the nation has pulled out of 
recession, about 60% of those surveyed by the Marist Institute said they 
believe their state is still in a slump. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have gotten better only slowly. And people aren't sure they are going 
to stay that way," Cuomo campaign chairman John Marino said in an interview. 
"That's true not only in New York but all around the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Cuomo clearly has not tired of being governor. In the face of adversity he 
displays the same energy and will that has made him a power in the nation's 
second-largest state for more than a decade and the beau ideal of liberal 
Democrats around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the most innovative and most exciting schools in the city," 
Cuomo told a reporter recently as he bounded up the steps of Intermediate 
School 218 in Inwood. "Keep your eyes open," he urged. "These kids and teachers 
have great ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Inwood is one of many New York neighborhoods that have been ravaged by poverty 
and neglect. The governor was there to accept a $10-million federal grant to 
help schools better prepare their students to take jobs and start businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 And to give Cuomo an extra boost, the Clinton Administration had dispatched 
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich to deliver the grant personally. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor has set a national standard for an active government, applying 
new ideas to improve everybody's life," Reich declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuomo's campaign challenge is twofold. On one hand he must convince New York's 
middle-class moderate voters that he does not fit the image of irresponsible 
spender and taxer that the Republicans have carved out for him. On the other, 
he must stir enough enthusiasm among the New York Democratic Party's remaining 
liberal cadres -- minorities, union members, feminists and the like -- to get 
them to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 To refute the big-spending charge, Cuomo has promised to disclose plans before 
Election Day to cut more than $1 billion in taxes. He has also pledged to 
strengthen the tax base by increasing efforts to foster the growth of high-tech 
industry in the state. At the same time he has been striving to revive longtime 
allegiances among New York's myriad minority groups by sounding the traditional 
battle cries of the liberal past. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking to the intermediate school students, he reminded them of his own 
difficult origins as the son of immigrant Italian parents. When he recently 
discovered from an old report card that he had been absent for 38 days in his 
first term in school, Cuomo said he asked his aged mother if he had been sick. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you mean sick?" his mother retorted, according to Cuomo. "I 
breast-fed you until you were 3 years old to keep you healthy. You were absent 
because you were ashamed to go to school because you couldn't speak English." 
</P>
<P>
 Rising from those humble roots, Cuomo earned a law degree at St. John's 
University, won recognition as a private attorney and battled his way through 
the echelons of New York state politics before laying claim to the governor's 
office in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984 he became a national figure with his impassioned keynote speech to the 
Democratic National Convention that nominated Walter F. Mondale for President. 
He urged Americans to "look past the glitter, beyond the showmanship" of Ronald 
Reagan's presidency to see that "there are people who sleep in the city's 
streets, in the gutter, where the glitter doesn't show." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the speech stamped him as one of liberalism's most eloquent spokesmen, 
in his home state some Democratic critics complained that his deeds failed to 
fulfill the promise of his liberal rhetoric, noting that he took advantage of 
the booming economy of the '80s to cut personal income tax rates rather than to 
launch new social programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cuomo did much to back the government programs that liberals admire, 
increasing spending on education, expanding health insurance coverage and 
plowing $50 billion into roads, bridges and mass transit systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The crunch for Cuomo came with the onset of the 1990 recession, which forced 
him to cancel the third installment of a three-year cut in personal income 
taxes and to raise several other levies. It is these increases that have 
provided ammunition for Pataki's efforts to depict Cuomo as a big-spending 
liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuomo prefers to describe himself as a "progressive pragmatist." But when he 
was asked, after his talk at the intermediate school, about the slogan aired in 
Pataki's campaign commercials -- "Mario Cuomo: too liberal, for too long" -- 
Cuomo sought to give his own meaning for the dreaded "L word." 
</P>
<P>
 "If liberal means that I want to see these children be given at least the 
opportunity I had, then I am a liberal," he said. "If liberal means I want 
everybody to have health care, then I'm a liberal. If liberal means building 
more prison cells than all other governors in the history of New York state 
built, then I'm a liberal, because I did that." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as their candidate strives to define himself, Cuomo's strategists are 
hoping to label their opponent, Pataki, as out of step with the moderate 
tradition established by four-term GOP Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, who in 1970 
was the last Republican to win that office. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 49-year-old Pataki, whose genial manner belies his ambition, does not 
offer much of a target. In his 10 years as a legislator, he authored no major 
legislation. And in a welfare reform package offered last week, Pataki steered 
away from drastic measures proposed in other states to cut welfare 
beneficiaries from the rolls. Instead he concentrated on milder proposals to 
increase the number of welfare recipients taking public service employment. 
</P>
<P>
 But most analysts agree that the main issue in this campaign is and will 
remain Cuomo and his record. And Pataki is expected to avoid making proposals 
that would make voters forget their disenchantment with the incumbent governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the ideological baggage he carries, Cuomo also suffers from the New 
York version of anti-incumbent fever. And in Cuomo's case this resentment is 
probably reinforced by reaction to his forceful personality; admirable at 
times, it can also be abrasive, even to his admirers. 
</P>
<P>
 In this sense Cuomo may be the quintessential New Yorker whom even New Yorkers 
after 12 years find hard to take. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to a group of supporters in Manhattan last week, Cuomo conceded as 
much, saying: "There are a whole bunch of people who say, 'Mario, for God 
sakes, 16 years. Are you kidding? What the hell is this? Did you inherit the 
office?' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Cuomo shrugs off his difficulties, saying: "It will be close for a while 
but not as close as you think. I'm going to be around for four more years."

NIXON FUNERAL COST TAXPAYERS $311,039

<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Nixon's funeral in California cost the federal government $311,039, 
with most of the expense paid by the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 The Military District of Washington, which was in charge of the government's 
arrangements, released the figures on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force spent $211,582, which included the $25,000 cost of taking 
President Clinton and invited dignitaries across the country on Air Force One 
and $150,000 for two C-141 transports carrying troops for the honor guard. 
</P>
<P>
 The former president, who died on April 22 after a stroke, is buried next to 
his wife on the grounds of the Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 The city said its expenses totaled $98,235 to handle 34,000 people who either 
paid their last respects or stood outside of the grounds while 8,000 invited 
guests attended the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Yorba Linda City Councilman Mark Schwing had suggested that the federal 
government help pick up that tab too. The office of the area's congressman, 
Rep. Jay Kim (R-Diamond Bar), said the idea never was pushed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Early, budget director for the General Services Administration, said he 
never received a formal request for reimbursement.

CLINTON VENTURES ONTO UNFRIENDLY TURF; POLITICS: PRESIDENT HOPES TO DELIVER 
ENOUGH UNCOMMITTED BLACK VOTES IN VIRGINIA TO HELP ROBB BEAT NORTH, KEEP SENATE 
IN DEMOCRATS' HANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Virginians don't care for Democratic presidents in general. And the polls show 
that most of them don't like Bill Clinton in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in an election year when he is avoiding many conservative states, 
President Clinton made his first political foray Monday into the the Old 
Dominion on a hunch that he could raise money and deliver Democratic voters for 
beleaguered Sen. Charles S. Robb (D-Va.). 
</P>
<P>
 The key: The many uncommitted black voters who could still enable Robb to edge 
ahead of front-running Republican candidate Oliver L. North -- and perhaps save 
Democratic control of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 In a year when congressional control is at stake, the African American vote is 
important, said Joan Baggett, the White House political director. "We're 
reaching out for it wherever we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's appearance for Robb at a pair of fund-raisers underscores a broader 
imperative facing the Democrats as they try to hold the congressional seats 
needed to ensure Clinton's viability. 
</P>
<P>
 In race after race, they need to energize a Democratic core that is big enough 
to be decisive in the year's many tight races but has sharply cooled to Clinton 
since the Democrats' season of hope two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The importance of the party base is always magnified in midterm elections, 
when only one-third of registered voters are expected to show up, compared to 
the roughly half who vote during presidential election years. The no-shows tend 
to be people from lower on the socioeconomic scale -- "read, Democratic 
voters," said Mark A. Siegal, a newsletter publisher and former Democratic 
Party official. 
</P>
<P>
 This year there is abundant evidence from primaries and polls that, while many 
conservative voters are excited about the election, such reliable Democratic 
groups as labor and black voters are torn by an ambivalence that could severely 
depress their turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 Union members, while pleased at Clinton's advocacy of health reform, were 
disappointed at its failure. They also actively fought the Administration's 
efforts on behalf of two big trade agreements in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 70% of black voters approve of Clinton's performance, the polls 
show, compared to about 40% for the electorate as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet if they like him overall, their passion has been cooled by Clinton's 
advocacy of budget-cutting, capital punishment, prison-building and free trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could make a good case that the (black) turnout -- or lack of it -- could 
decide five or six elections," Siegal said. These could include close Senate 
races in California, Minnesota, New Jersey and Massachusetts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not always a simple matter to turn out the Democratic core without 
mobilizing the opposition at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Highly visible appearances by the President, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 
or national party leaders will bring out Democratic fans but also may give 
energy to Clinton-haters and potentially turn some swing voters as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "So to the extent you jack up the turnout, you may also be increasing the 
hostile vote," said Stuart Rothenberg, a political analyst in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 In Virginia, North is clearly counting on just that effect to help him. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a state that has not gone for a Democratic President since Lyndon B. 
Johnson's landslide of 1964. North, who has built his campaign on attempts to 
associate Robb with Clinton, greeted the President's visit with new 30-second 
TV ads designed to pound home that connection. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts predicted that pictures of Clinton and Robb at the fund-raisers soon 
will be splashed over North's campaign flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 There is reason to believe that Clinton could make a difference, however, 
because large numbers of black voters remain uncommitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three weeks ago, former Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, rather than Robb, was 
expected to get most of these votes. 
</P>
<P>
 When third-running Wilder dropped out of the race on Sept. 15, most analysts 
expected his bitter rival, Robb, to win the allegiance of most black voters. 
But that has not occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, according to a poll released last week, about 34% of black voters 
have moved over to the undecided column. Robb's 33% share of the overall 
electorate has remained the same and North has held his 35% lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll, by the Mason-Dixon PMR firm, found that last-running Coleman had 
inherited more of the Wilder vote than Robb and had moved up from 13% to 18%. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said that the big undecided vote may reflect the reluctance of former 
Wilder voters to join the camp of a politician Wilder had fought -- and 
publicly denounced -- for so many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Black Virginians "generally like Clinton: They think he is interested in their 
issues," said Del. Gerrauld Jones (D-Norfolk), chairman of the Joint 
Legislative Black Caucus, in the Virginia General Assembly.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; HAITIANS CHEER U.S. SHOW OF FORCE; OCCUPATION: 'YOU 
HAVE DELIVERED US FROM HELL,' DECLARES ONE BYSTANDER AS AMERICAN TROOPS 
CONVERGE ON MILITIA'S HEADQUARTERS.

 "You are sent from God!" screamed Nasal Aristil from across the street just 
before 10 a.m. Monday as two Sheridan M155 tanks blanketed with American troops 
lowered their gun barrels at the headquarters of Haiti's dreaded paramilitary 
known as FRAPH. 
</P>
<P>
 Within seconds, dozens of combat soldiers from the U.S. Army's 10th Mountain 
Division leaped from trucks, jeeps, armed Humvees and five tanks. They swarmed 
the building, sweeping the street with U.S. Marine Criminal Intelligence 
officers, searching scores of Haitians, confiscating more than 20 pistols and 
10 rifles and finally handcuffing and detaining about two dozen suspected 
members of one of Haiti's most hated state terrorist groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have delivered us from hell," Aristil declared as thousands of Haitians, 
among them victims of the group's brutality, chanted, "Long live the 
Americans!" to the troops and "Die like dogs!" to their former tormentors. 
</P>
<P>
 In storming the small, three-building complex with a fearsome column of armor 
and without a shot, the U.S. force in Haiti had scored its first major victory 
in an intensifying psychological war after two weeks of violence and confusion 
left many Haitians wondering why the Americans are here. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Army Specialist Malcolm Abel, one of the first soldiers to hit the 
two-story FRAPH headquarters, summed it up as he prepared to pull out. "I guess 
we took care of the bad part of the block," Abel said, beaming and pumping with 
adrenalin. "I think the Haitians who had mixed emotions about us being here are 
going to be on our side now." 
</P>
<P>
 A cheering mob of impoverished Haitians who had watched the spectacle with awe 
and applause expressed that sentiment another way. In a half-hour orgy of 
destruction, they demolished the place, tearing into the headquarters of a 
group whose acronym means "hit" in French and Creole. They smashed telephones, 
cameras, desks, chairs and every last stick of furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 One member of the American assault team summed up the feelings of many: "All I 
can say is, it's about time," the sergeant said. "We should have done this days 
ago -- before these thugs killed again. And I think we should be doing even 
more right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction on both sides made clear that Monday's raid was the most powerful 
demonstration yet by U.S. commanders that they are serious about dismantling 
Haiti's military regime before they usher in ousted President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 The search and seizure dealt Haiti's lingering regime its biggest blow since 
the day the American troops arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments after the raid was launched, a van packed with armed Haitian policemen 
apparently summoned by desperate members inside the FRAPH building sped to the 
scene. A squad of American troops faced them down and arrested all seven, 
handcuffed them, taped their mouths shut and forced them to sit in an open 
truck near the crowd for an hour of insults, curses and threats. 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, Haitian policemen throughout the city were furious and 
demoralized. One of the arrested officers, identified only as Lt. Jackie, 
burned his uniform out of humiliation after he and the others were released. 
And at Haitian police headquarters, a sergeant muttered, "The Americans 
obviously don't want us here anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither did anyone in the crowd, whose explosion of sheer emotion underscored 
the power and magic of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to eat this woman!" screamed Foufoune Exavier, 18, jabbing her mangled 
and stitched right hand in the direction of one of the four FRAPH women the 
soldiers had handcuffed in the open troop truck. "That dog! She's the one who 
threw the grenade that did this to me last week." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, a U.S. soldier offered a water canteen to prisoners on the 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't give them water! Beat them instead!" shouted Patrick Paul, who said he 
had been arrested and beaten twice by FRAPH members in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't take them away! Give them to us! We'll run them through with a sword," 
the crowd chanted, as the trucks started their engines to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene after the soldiers left was even more chilling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's a FRAPH! He's hiding here!" shouted someone in the crowd. In seconds, 
hundreds descended on the helpless man, who was later identified as Vilneus 
Saint-Ange. They pummeled him, kicked him and dragged him toward the steps of 
the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beat him to death," dozens yelled. 
</P>
<P>
 The MPs on the scene intervened. They calmly worked their way through the 
crowd, lifted Saint-Ange from the mob's clutches and carried him to safety, 
shielded beside their Humvee.

IRISH NATIONALIST TAKES CASE TO CAPITOL HILL; ULSTER: SINN FEIN LEADER IS TOLD 
CLINTON HAS LIFTED A BAN ON OFFICIAL CONTACTS WITH HIS GROUP, THE POLITICAL ARM 
OF THE IRA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After a quarter-century as a political untouchable, the leader of the 
political arm of the Irish Republican Army entered the mainstream Monday, 
complete with all trappings: a news conference on the steps of the U.S. 
Capitol, meals with senators and representatives and even an appearance on a 
national talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry Adams, the adroit president of the IRA political group, Sinn Fein, awoke 
to a phone call from Vice President Al Gore telling him that President Clinton 
had decided to lift the ban on official contacts with his group and inviting 
him to a meeting today with mid-level State Department officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not bad for a fella who was a terrorist a month ago," said one of the Irish 
journalists who is following Adams on his two-week tour of the United States, 
whispering audibly on hearing the announcement of the phone call from Gore. 
</P>
<P>
 The gesture from the Clinton Administration offered access at a lower level 
than Adams may have wanted but was nonetheless symbolic of a very long journey 
in a very brief time. Just a few weeks ago, Adams' image and voice were still 
banned on British radio and television. Until Sunday, he was not allowed to 
have official contact with the U.S. government. Until February, he was 
officially considered an international killer prohibited from entering this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 The change in U.S. policy was prompted by the IRA's announcement Aug. 31 of a 
cease-fire in its 25-year fight against British rule in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 As he began his tour of Washington, starting with a congressional breakfast 
with Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) and Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.), the 
tall, bearded Adams seemed to have command of many nuances of American 
politics. He even dressed in the uniform that politicians have deemed best for 
TV appeal -- dark blue suit, blue shirt and red tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you consider yourself in American political terms more a Democrat or a 
Republican?" one reporter shouted as Adams headed into the Capitol for a 
luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
 "An Irish Republican," the 48-year-old former prisoner and victim of bombing 
attacks on his home quickly shot back. 
</P>
<P>
 "How does it feel to be headed into the Capitol?" another asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of what is everyday life here is absent in my country," he answered. 
"The right to assembly, freedom of speech, the right to jury trial. You should 
cherish this. It's almost like culture shock to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Later he met with Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and House Speaker 
Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and then sat between two rival groups of lawmakers 
who had taken opposite sides on the Irish conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, Adams struck a carefully conciliatory tone, using his gift 
of gab to try to persuade doubters who consider him a terrorist. 
</P>
<P>
 "The unionists have as much right to be on the island of Ireland as I do," he 
said at one point of the Protestants he has been fighting for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The fighting in Northern Ireland has not yet ended, he said, but he blamed the 
British for that and suggested that the IRA is living up to its cease-fire 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Unknown to most Americans until only a few months ago, Adams was officially 
viewed as the de facto general of the IRA's bombing war against military and 
civilian targets. 
</P>
<P>
 But Adams emerged as the only figure with enough stature and credibility to 
persuade more-militant factions of the IRA to accept the offer from London and 
Dublin late last year for peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Adams will have his meeting at the State Department -- not the White 
House, as he reportedly had hoped -- with John Kornblum, assistant secretary of 
state for European affairs; Leon Furth, the vice president's national security 
adviser, and Nancy Soderberg, an official of the President's National Security 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, Adams' visit, which began in Boston and New York, will include 
Hartford, Conn.; Detroit; Cleveland; Philadelphia; San Francisco and Los 
Angeles.

CARDOSO GETS BRAZIL PRESIDENCY, POLLS SHOW; ELECTION: MAN CREDITED WITH HALTING 
RUNAWAY INFLATION APPARENTLY AVOIDS A RUNOFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the man credited with halting at least for now 
Brazil's decade-long runaway inflation, Monday became the nation's second 
democratically elected president in the past 31 years, according to exit polls. 
</P>
<P>
 The 63-year-old sociologist and former senator captured more than 50% of the 
valid vote, post-election voter surveys reported, and apparently avoided a 
November runoff with runner-up Luis Inacio (Lula) da Silva, a former union 
leader and candidate of the socialist Workers' Party. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brazil, voting is mandatory for everybody between the ages of 18 and 70, 
but voters can cast a blank or a spoiled ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 A Gallup poll of voters at election sites reported that Cardoso captured 45.1% 
of the total vote compared to 42.1% of the vote for all the other candidates 
combined. Twelve percent of the electorate cast a blank vote. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Brazil's Ibope poll, Cardoso captured 46% of the vote compared to 
39% for the other candidates, and 15% of the electorate cast a blank vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The first official tallies are not expected until today. Final official 
election results will probably not be complete for at least five days, election 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Workers' Party, which is headed by Da Silva -- who is 
universally know as Lula -- refused to concede the election, holding onto the 
slim hope that their candidate will force a Nov. 15 runoff between the two 
leading candidates. A runoff would be necessary if no candidate receives a 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe there will be a second round," said Marcos Aurelio Garcia, a 
ranking party official and senior aide to Lula. "One way that we can ensure 
that is for our members to go out and oversee the counting of the votes 
tomorrow morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoso, author, former ambassador to the United States and a brief political 
exile during the country's 21-year military dictatorship, catapulted to the 
front of a field of eight presidential hopefuls atop a wave of support for an 
economic plan he devised while serving earlier this year as the country's 
finance minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the commencement in July of Cardoso's "Plano Real," which included 
the introduction of a new currency, inflation dropped from 50% in June to 6% in 
July and less than 1% in August. 
</P>
<P>
 As inflation dropped and the nation's economy stabilized, voters turned toward 
Cardoso and away from Lula, who had built a sizable early lead based on voter 
dissatisfaction and promises of radical social reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real plan is one that (Cardoso) developed," said student Virginia Goas, 
20, after casting her vote for Cardoso at a Sao Paulo election site. "By voting 
for him, it guarantees that the plan will continue to work." 
</P>
<P>
 If the exit polls are accurate, Cardoso will be the second popularly elected 
president since 1963, when a military dictatorship took power and controlled 
the country until 1984, when Jose Sarney was installed as president through a 
parliamentary process. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando Collor de Mello became president in 1989 following national 
elections, but was impeached three years later. Monday's elections were the 
biggest in Brazil's history, with voters choosing a new president, hundreds of 
congressmen, two-thirds of the Senate, all 27 governors and 1,500 state 
legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday was declared a national holiday to ensure that the nation's 94 million 
registered voters had time to go to the balloting sites. 
</P>
<P>
 In major cities like Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Salvador and Belo Horizonte, 
voters waded to the polls through streets littered with election pamphlets, 
posters and papers that were either distributed by hand, thrown to pedestrians 
from passing cars or rained down like confetti upon the electorate from office 
buildings during the final days of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "This campaign has been really great" in terms of avoiding mud-slinging, 
Cardoso, candidate of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party, told reporters in 
Sao Paulo as he headed to cast his vote. Cardoso left the city Monday afternoon 
for a ranch in the interior of the state. Aides said he will hold a news 
conference on the election later this week in Brasilia, the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Lula, 48, however, denounced the election as "illegitimate," after casting his 
vote in an industrial suburb of Sao Paulo. Cardoso, he said, was boosted by big 
business, the media, the government of President Itamar Franco and the 
distribution of fraudulent sample ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 12 million incorrect sample ballots used to educate voters prior to 
the election were found in the possession of Cardoso's Social Democratic Party 
and in the offices of two other parties with which Cardoso has formed alliances

 On the ballots, Lula's name appeared third instead of fourth, as it appears on 
the official ballot. Lula said the incorrect position would confuse millions of 
illiterate voters who had been taught to vote according to the position of the 
candidate's name on the official ballot.

FERRY CARGO DOOR TORN OFF, PROBERS SAY

<P>
 The 60-ton front cargo door of the sunken ferry Estonia was torn off during a 
storm when its locks failed, investigators said Monday after examining video 
pictures of the sunken ship. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 800 people were killed in the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigators' preliminary conclusions were based on more than 15 hours of 
videotape taken by remote-controlled cameras of the wrecked ferry, which went 
down off the coast of Finland in a violent storm Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The video showed that the huge hinged door used for loading cars and trucks 
onto the ferry had "fully separated from the rest of the vessel," the 
investigators said in a statement. The door was not found. 
</P>
<P>
 The Estonia sank after an estimated 1,000 tons of water flooded the ship's car 
deck, said one of the investigators, Tuomo Karppinen of Finland.

ISRAEL AND JORDAN AGREE TO JOINT 'WARM PEACE' PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel and Jordan, consolidating what President Clinton called a "warm peace" 
between former enemies, announced on Monday joint economic and environmental 
projects intended to give their citizens a tangible dividend from the end of 46 
years of hostility. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan 
completed work on the measures in a meeting at the White House with Clinton and 
other U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we succeed in our endeavors, and I do believe we shall, it will serve as a 
model for many other places," Peres told reporters with Hassan and Clinton at 
his side. "We are going to take parts of the desert and convert it into valleys 
of peace, of agriculture, of tourism." 
</P>
<P>
 The new projects, under consideration since Israel and Jordan ended their 
formal state of war in July, are designed to speed the economic and commercial 
development of the Jordan Rift Valley, a largely desert region centered on the 
Dead Sea and straddling the border between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres and Hassan also agreed to open a second border crossing in the north of 
the two countries, establish a free-trade zone between the southern cities of 
Eilat and Aqaba, create a Red Sea Marine Peace Park and begin feasibility 
studies of dams on the Yarmuk and Jordan rivers to alleviate the region's 
chronic water shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said the measures "are solid evidence that Jordan and Israel have not 
only ended their state of war but are following through on their commitment to 
cooperate with each other and negotiate as rapidly as possible a final peace 
treaty. The steps we announce today are the building blocks of a modern peace 
between these ancient lands." 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli and Jordanian officials said they hope to complete negotiations on a 
formal peace treaty by the year's end. Meantime, the two countries are creating 
a warmer relationship than exists between many states that have been at peace 
for generations, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department officials said Secretary of State Warren Christopher will 
visit the Middle East starting this weekend to resume his shuttle mediation 
between Israel and Syria. In advance of that trip, Clinton plans to meet Friday 
at the White House with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said Israel and Syria are inching toward a peace agreement, 
though officials of the two nations have not met face-to-face for months. 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Syrian President Hafez Assad are 
communicating through American go-betweens. 
</P>
<P>
 Before returning to Washington, Christopher plans to attend ceremonies marking 
the northern border crossing between Israel and Jordan. The first crossing 
between the two countries linking Eilat and Aqaba was opened in August. Until 
the completion of a final peace treaty, the border is open only to citizens of 
third countries. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jerusalem, Rabin predicted Israel and Jordan will complete a peace treaty 
"shortly, even before the end of the year." But in a speech to the opening 
session of the Israeli Parliament, Rabin said Israel and Syria are still far 
apart in their separate negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the remaining issues in the Israel-Jordan talks are border 
demarcation, water and security.

IRAN REJECTS RUSSIA PLEDGE TO HALT ARMS

 Russia's promise not to sell more arms to Iran, given by Russian President 
Boris N. Yeltsin to President Clinton last week, "amounts to nothing," a senior 
Iranian official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1988 arms deal between the former Soviet Union and Iran was effectively 
open-ended, said the official, who asked not to be identified.Russia decided to 
stick with that deal after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1992, the 
official said, and there is nothing in the promise Yeltsin made in Washington 
to change that. 
</P>
<P>
 The official characterized Yeltsin's promise as "face-saving propaganda for 
what has not been achieved." Yeltsin agreed that Russia would sign "no other 
new contracts" to supply arms to Iran, but the Iranian official said that no 
further contracts were necessary.

GIFT OF ORGANS BY GRIEVING U.S. FAMILY TOUCHES ITALIANS; TRANSPLANTS: THE 
GENEROSITY OF PARENTS OF SLAIN 7-YEAR-OLD NICHOLAS GREEN MEANS LIFE FOR OTHER 
CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In death, 7-year-old Nicholas Green gave life, and the humanity of his parents 
is giving Italians a wrenching moment of introspection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their gracious and generous gesture gives us a lesson in civility," one 
national television commentator said of Reginald and Margaret Green. 
</P>
<P>
 The Green family, on vacation from Bodega Bay, Calif., was driving in southern 
Italy along a freeway in Calabria Thursday night when three masked bandits 
opened fire from another car. Police think the gunmen decided to attack and rob 
the Greens in their rented subcompact after seeing them at a rest-stop coffee 
bar along the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Reginald Green frustrated the attack by refusing to stop. But one bullet 
mortally wounded Nicholas, asleep in the back next to his 4-year-old sister. 
The children were tired: The family had toured the southern coast during the 
day, swum in the sea and visited the Greek ruins at Paestum south of Naples. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas Green was declared brain-dead at a hospital in Messina, Sicily, 
Saturday night and disconnected from life supports. His parents asked that his 
organs be used to save other children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reginald Green's courage has amazed and moved Italy," the Milan newspaper 
Corriere della Sera said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to thank you, not only for the transplants but also for the lesson of 
generosity, of composure," said commentator Enzo Biagi, in an open letter 
addressed to Reginald Green. "Someone has written that nothing makes us greater 
than a great sorrow. This, you have shown." 
</P>
<P>
 Newspapers and television commentators are railing at government inability to 
make safe a main north-south artery. The stretch between Salerno and Reggio 
Calabria in southern Italy is a notorious lair for highwaymen who attack 
passing cars. 
</P>
<P>
 A high-pressure police hunt for the boy's killers has been fruitless so far. 
Inevitably, Italians are comparing their less-developed southern region to 
Florida, where attacks on tourists have found international echo. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergio and Daniela Russo, Romans who were shot Aug. 24 while celebrating their 
silver wedding anniversary in central Florida, returned home over the weekend 
to find doctor and hospital bills of around $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sad for Nicholas Green. While I was in the hospital in Florida, I told 
people that incidents of this sort didn't happen in Italy. I wish my tongue had 
fallen out. Now we too have reached a level of unsustainable barbarity," said 
Daniela Russo, shot in the stomach in the attack in Kissimmee. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is home to the Mafia and other branches of organized crime, Italy 
is not a violent country by American standards. About as many people are 
murdered among the 57 million Italians each year as in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But Italy also has one of the lowest organ donation rates in Europe, according 
to Health Minister Raffaele Costa: six donations per year for every 1 million 
inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Green family serves as an example. In Italy, half of those who could 
agree to donate organs don't, with predictable consequences for those waiting 
to be saved," transplant surgeon Carlo Marcelletti said in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers and staff at Catania airport applauded the Greens as they began 
their trip home Monday. The city of Messina said it would pay to transport 
Nicholas' body. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor of Rome ordered a gold medal in recognition of the Green family's 
courage. Mayor Giacomo Mancini of Cosenza said his Calabrian city would name a 
street for the dead boy.

IMPORT OF GUNS BLOCKED FROM FORMER U.S.S.R. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher has decided to block the importation of 
as many as 7.6 million handguns and rifles from the former Soviet Union, the 
State Department said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher also ordered a study to determine why so many Russian guns are 
appearing on the world market and recommend what U.S. policy should be, 
spokesman Mike McCurry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a huge increase in the volume of license applications that we've 
seen," McCurry said, noting that only 18,000 firearms were imported from the 
former Soviet Union last year. "We think it's a good idea to know a lot more 
about this before any of those applications are approved." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher acted to deny the import licenses after several members of 
Congress, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Rep. Charles E. 
Schumer (D-N.Y.), learned about the huge volume of applications from a report 
in The Times and demanded that they be blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 But a State Department official said that the decision "was already in the 
works." 
</P>
<P>
 Gun imports are regulated by the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms. But licenses for imports from the former Soviet Union 
must also be approved by the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry said that U.S. firms have filed more than 250 applications to import 
small arms and ammunition from the former Soviet Union, totaling 7.6 million 
guns and more than 7 billion rounds of ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 However, importers routinely file applications for much larger numbers of guns 
than they expect to sell, other officials noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States already imports more than 1 million guns a year from 
countries such as Belgium, Brazil, Italy and Germany. Until recently, the 
states of the former Soviet Union were prohibited from selling significant 
numbers of guns to U.S. importers under Cold War regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia complains the regulations are discriminatory.

NEWS ANALYSIS; THE RUNNER STUMBLES: ESPY FELLED BY ETHICS QUESTIONS; CABINET: 
THE AGRICULTURE SECRETARY DREW PRAISE FOR A LIFE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT. BUT MANY 
WONDER HOW HE COULD LET A FEW PERKS PULL HIM DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN and ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The resignation of Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy on Monday marked the final 
act of a Washington morality play: a pioneering, promising public figure 
brought down by allegations of ethical transgressions that eroded the backing 
of the President who appointed him. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by the former Mississippi lawmaker, the youngest member of 
President Clinton's Cabinet and one of four blacks, left friends grasping to 
explain the undoing of a man who seemed to have almost a limitless political 
future a year ago. It also left many wondering how someone once regarded as so 
politically astute could seemingly have been so indifferent to the appearance, 
if not the reality, of abusing his office for personal gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly there were some lapses of judgment in the administration of his 
affairs that should have been taken care of with greater sensitivity to the law 
as well as to the perception," said Manley C. Molpus, president of the Grocery 
Manufacturers of America and a friend of Espy's. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with an investigation by an independent counsel into accusations that he 
improperly accepted travel, sports tickets and lodging from major companies 
regulated by the Agriculture Department, Espy had doggedly denied any 
wrongdoing for months. He took pains to repay companies and the government for 
$7,600 worth of questionable gifts and expenses. But as news accounts continued 
to raise questions about his conduct, he reluctantly determined that he had no 
choice but to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy, 40, a former Mississippi congressman, announced his resignation at a 
hastily scheduled news conference, saying: "I now owe it to myself and my 
family to turn my full attention to the matter of a defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Insisting that he had not been asked to step down by the President or any 
other White House official, he added: "This was my choice." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's seemed as if I was just twisting in the wind," Espy said. "And as these 
allegations continued, the twisting continued. And the bough finally broke in 
my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Espy, who will step down Dec. 31, acknowledged that he had been "careless with 
some of the details" of his personal affairs but insisted he had violated no 
laws or ethics rules. Referring to his lapses, he said: "I have failed myself, 
and for that I apologize to the President and to the loyal people who have 
served so well." 
</P>
<P>
 Espy may have failed to adapt to the tougher ethical standards that apply to 
members of the executive branch after facing laxer standards in his three terms 
in Congress. Lawmakers can accept gifts and travel as long as they publicly 
report them. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabinet secretaries, however, must operate under stricter regulations, which 
forbid gifts that might influence them in their official duties. Under a 1907 
meatpacking law, the agriculture secretary's behavior is even more tightly 
circumscribed. In that role, according to Donald Smaltz, independent counsel in 
the case, Espy is prohibited from accepting virtually any kind of gratuity, 
such as travel accommodations or sports tickets, from regulated companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, though, another key factor contributing to Espy's fall was that the 
allegations occurred in a political climate far less forgiving to even the 
appearance of impropriety than that which existed even a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy was, after all, appointed by a President who vowed to sharply curtail the 
influence of special interests in the nation's capital. This made the 
allegations against him more nettlesome for Clinton -- particularly since the 
President is bedeviled by his own ethical troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's working for a President who has his own ethics problems . . . " said a 
long-term supporter of Espy's. "He did not want to be a drag on the President." 
</P>
<P>
 A former congressional colleague and friend offered his own explanation for 
the secretary's apparent behavior: "It seems as though he behaved as though he 
was still a member (of Congress). This is not a corrupt or venal guy." 
</P>
<P>
 During Espy's first year in the House, for example, he accepted $23,250 for 19 
speeches and 22 expense-paid trips, including travel to Israel, Taiwan and the 
Bahamas. Those trips involved far larger expenditures than the gratuities Espy 
apparently has accepted as secretary. But they were permitted under 
congressional rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially Espy and his allies insisted that stories about alleged wrongdoing 
were being spread by Republicans and other foes, including entrenched opponents 
of change within the sprawling department. But now even some of the secretary's 
supporters sadly acknowledge that amid the frenetic pace he maintained, Espy 
had indeed made mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just let what could have been insignificant details of his life get 
totally out of control," said a White House official. "He missed the signals 
along the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Some, such as Molpus, suggested that Espy would have been better served by 
stronger guidance from staff members, who should have steered him away from 
actions that could prove damaging. But others contended that he was following a 
long tradition of cozy relationships between the secretary of agriculture and 
the farmers, ranchers and growers whose high-stakes interests his department 
regulates. 
</P>
<P>
 John Block, who was agriculture secretary under Ronald Reagan, praised Espy's 
performance on the job. But he said he was astounded by Espy's behavior when it 
came to perquisites. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't understand for the life of me why he put himself in the position he 
did by accepting gratuities from companies that are regulated by the 
department," Block said. "Either his staff did not serve him well or he just 
ignored them and moved ahead and did things that did not make sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly egregious, Block said, was Espy's decision to have the government 
pay for a vehicle that Espy leased in Mississippi. Espy originally leased the 
Jeep Cherokee when he was in Congress. He used it for professional and personal 
business during his 20 taxpayer-funded visits home in his first 20 months as 
secretary -- nearly a quarter of all his trips. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was secretary, I had a farm in Illinois and I went back there every 
month or two," Block said. "I would not have had the government rent a Jeep for 
me when I was there. If I had tried, my staff would have stopped me." 
</P>
<P>
 Equally damaging were allegations involving Tyson Foods Inc., the huge 
Arkansas agribusiness that has been closely linked to Clinton and First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton. Espy accepted travel, lodging and sports tickets from 
Tyson, and his chief of staff allegedly temporarily halted work on proposed 
regulations to toughen poultry inspection standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The final blow for White House officials, sources said, was a revelation that 
Patricia Dempsey, a woman friend of Espy's, had accepted a $1,200 scholarship 
from a foundation run by Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Espy's involvement with Tyson, Thomas E. Mann, director of governmental 
studies at the Brookings Institution, said: "Even sympathetic observers, I'm 
sure, were surprised that he didn't see this one coming and bend over backward" 
in order to avoid any action that could pose any ethical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, Espy's fall was particularly tragic given his meteoric rise and the 
pride that it engendered among Mississippians as well as African Americans. He 
was the first black elected to Congress from Mississippi since Reconstruction 
and was widely touted as a likely candidate to become the state's first black 
governor or U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney and political moderate, he was the first black, first Southerner 
and youngest person ever appointed secretary of agriculture, a post 
traditionally filled by Midwesterners with farming backgrounds.

SCHOOL BOARD IN CONNECTICUT GIVES REINS TO PRIVATE COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the protests of some teachers and parents, the school board voted Monday 
to put a private company in charge of its public school system, becoming the 
first city in the nation to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hartford Board of Education voted, 6 to 3, to sign a five-year contract 
with Education Alternatives Inc., making the publicly held company responsible 
for the education of 25,000 schoolchildren in this city of about 140,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford turned to privatization in desperation over high dropout rates, low 
test scores and deteriorating facilities at the district's 32 schools. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawsuit by the Hartford Federation of Teachers to block the contract was 
dismissed last month. The American Federation of Teachers also opposed the deal 
and recommended a moratorium on contracts with Education Alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're going to have left is nothing for the children. You treat them 
like so much livestock," said Steven Fournier, a parent who spoke at a raucous 
hearing before the vote. "This is an invitation to corruption." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jane Carroll, a teacher and the wife of school board member Ted Carroll, 
argued that her "morale as a teacher will climb considerably when I have a copy 
machine to use, when I have paper that I don't have to buy myself, when I have 
construction paper, when my child has a globe in her geography class." 
</P>
<P>
 Education Alternatives manages 11 public schools in Baltimore; a public school 
in Miami Beach; a private school in Minnesota, and a private school in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Never before has a private company managed an entire school district. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the contract, Education Alternatives essentially controls the school 
district's $171.1-million budget, as well as $29 million in state and federal 
grants. 
</P>
<P>
 The company will pay all bills, purchase school supplies and have a key role 
in hiring and firing personnel, as well as conducting union negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The company could earn profits from the district's budget only after all 
expenditures are paid. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first year, Education Alternatives will invest $1.6 million in school 
improvements and about $14 million in teaching technology, such as computers.

POLICE OFFICIAL INDICTED IN SEX SCANDAL CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An alleged sex scandal involving a member of Congress widened Monday when the 
chief press spokesman for the Chicago Police Department was indicted on charges 
related to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Davis, the police public information officer, was indicted by a Cook 
County grand jury on charges of official misconduct.The indictment alleged that 
he tipped Rep. Mel Reynolds to an investigation before the freshman Democrat's 
indictment on statutory rape and other charges in August. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the indictments contend that Davis failed to tell his superiors 
that he knew of Reynolds' activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who once did public relations work for Reynolds, told reporters: "I am 
not guilty of the charges." 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds has pleaded not guilty to charges contained in a 20-count indictment 
that alleges he had an affair with a 16-year-old campaign worker two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, who is married, has denied having sexual intercourse with the girl.

NEW YORKER WRITER BACK IN COURT FOR LIBEL RETRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The retrial of a celebrated libel suit over a New Yorker magazine article 
started Monday where the first trial left off, with writer Janet Malcolm 
acknowledging that she rearranged quotes but denying that she invented them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was following here a technique which the New Yorker is known for, 
organizing people's speech" into a coherent monologue, said Malcolm, who was 
called as an adverse witness by a lawyer for psychoanalyst Jeffrey Masson. 
</P>
<P>
 Masson, former projects director of the Sigmund Freud Archives, accuses 
Malcolm of fabricating or distorting five statements she attributed to him in a 
1983 article. The article, later published as a book, centered on Masson's 
firing by the archives in 1981 after he challenged Freud's theory that women 
usually fantasize accounts of childhood sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenged quotes include statements that Masson planned to turn Freud's 
house into "a place of sex, women, fun," that archive officials considered him 
an "intellectual gigolo," and that he would be regarded as the greatest analyst 
since Freud. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one of the five quotes appears in more than 40 hours of tape recordings 
of Malcolm's interviews with Masson, and the context is in dispute. Malcolm 
says most of the others were in her notes. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal court jury found last year that all five quotes were false but 
deadlocked on damages, requiring a retrial. The New Yorker was cleared of 
wrongdoing by the jury.

SUPREME COURT ISSUES ORDERS IN 1,700 CASES AS SESSION OPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court, returning to the bench from its summer recess, issued 
orders in nearly 1,700 cases Monday. In all but a few, it simply denied an 
appeal. Among the highlights, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 * Asked the Justice Department for its view of a 1988 federal law that aims to 
regulate Native American gambling (Seminole Tribe vs. Florida, 94-12). The 
court is likely to enter the high-stakes battle later in its term and resolve 
disputes over whether states can block casino gambling on reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Refused to review a U.S. appeals court ruling lambasting the Justice 
Department for its handling of the deportation of accused Nazi death camp guard 
John Demjanjuk (Rison vs. Demjanjuk, 93-1875). This ruling does not prevent the 
government from seeking to deport the 74-year-old former auto worker from 
Cleveland again. 
</P>
<P>
 * Refused to revive author Dan Moldea's $10-million lawsuit against the New 
York Times over a harsh book review (Moldea vs. New York Times, 94-192). Last 
year, a federal appeals court said that Moldea's suit could go to trial because 
he alleged that the reviewer had misstated facts about his book. But the same 
court later reversed itself and threw out the suit after it concluded that the 
disputed passages were matters of interpretation, not fact. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sided with federal agents who seized the 65-million-year-old remains of a 
dinosaur discovered on Native American land in 1990 (Black Hills Institute vs. 
United States, 93-1825). The researchers who discovered the fossil in South 
Dakota objected to the seizure, but the lower courts agreed that the bones 
should not have been removed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dismissed an appeal by women's rights advocates who objected to state laws 
against "wrongful birth" lawsuits (Sejpal vs. Corson, 93-1820). A Pennsylvania 
woman sought to sue her doctors because they had failed to tell her of the 
risks of giving birth to a retarded child or to test the fetus in the womb. But 
Pennsylvania and eight other states specifically have barred such lawsuits.

AIRCRAFT NOISE AT GRAND CANYON, OTHER PARKS WORSENS, REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aircraft noise over the Grand Canyon and several other national parks is bad 
and getting worse, the Interior Department said Monday, urging tighter flight 
restrictions and use of quieter aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to Congress, the department said current limits on air tour 
operators at national parks are failing to stem the growing noise pollution 
that often destroys the solitude of nature for visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The department urged use of quieter helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft and 
announced that, along with the Federal Aviation Administration, it is 
developing new regulations aimed at reducing park noise over the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem isn't going to be resolved by minimum altitude rules," said 
George Frampton Jr., assistant secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 The department said it was reviewing incentives that might persuade air tour 
operators to use quieter equipment, but Frampton also did not rule out 
eventually imposing regulations to limit aircraft engine noise levels. The 
department also proposed further flight-length limits, expanded no-fly zones 
and narrowed corridors for aircraft operation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Grand Canyon is not the only park with aircraft noise problems. Nearly 
a third of the parks, monuments and scenic areas administered by the Park 
Service have problems with aircraft, the report to Congress said.

MORE MEDFLIES DISCOVERED IN CAMARILLO AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirty-one more Medflies were trapped in an orange grove at St. John's 
Seminary in Camarillo, halting shipments of produce from the area, authorities 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 31 Medflies, all wild males, were found within a quarter mile of the 
original pair of fertile females trapped Friday in eastern Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly trapped Medflies mean a quarantine of the area is imminent, 
officials said, with California Secretary of Food and Agriculture Henry Voss 
expected to sign the order this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarantine area will probably encompass 81 square miles, fanning out along 
a 4.5-mile radius in all directions from the original find, unless more 
Mediterranean fruit flies are found farther from the original site, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trapping will continue this week to determine the extent of the infestation. 
</P>
<P>
 The choices for combatting the infestation are ground or aerial spraying of 
the pesticide malathion or releasing sterile male flies to mate with wild 
females, agricultural officials said. Gov. Pete Wilson would first have to 
declare an emergency before Voss could order aerial spraying, a spokesman for 
the governor said.

SUSPECT IN O.C. KILLING LEFT PRINT, TRANSCRIPT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man charged with sexually assaulting and murdering a Huntington Beach woman 
was captured on videotape as he left a partial palm print with the victim's 
blood at the crime scene, according to grand jury transcripts unsealed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three videotapes taken by a parking lot surveillance camera show a man 
authorities say is Edward Patrick Morgan Jr. pulling the victim into the Orange 
lot, choking her at the top of a small staircase and then dragging her to the 
concrete enclosure where her battered body was discovered May 20, according to 
the transcripts unsealed at the request of The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 While the videotapes remain sealed, the transcripts reveal the horrific nature 
of the attack on Leanora Annette Wong, 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The case against Morgan triggered public outrage when it was revealed that the 
suspect has a long history of sexually assaulting young Orange County women but 
in nearly every case has managed to escape the most serious charges against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 He was convicted of one rape and allowed to plead guilty to lesser charges in 
two other cases. In a fourth case, Morgan was sent back to prison for one year 
for parole violation after authorities declined to prosecute him for rape, 
which could have sent him to prison for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, 28, of Orange, had just been paroled when the attack on Wong took 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics said Morgan's criminal history raises questions about how seriously 
Orange County prosecutors treat sex crimes against women. But prosecutors 
defend their actions, arguing that they did the best they could with cases in 
which victims had credibility problems. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the grand jury transcripts, Wong's face was severely pummeled and 
her skull was fractured in two places. She suffered five fractured ribs -- 
apparently when she was "stomped" so hard about the neck, chest and back that 
the pattern on the soles of her assailant's shoes are visible. She also was 
sexually assaulted with a sharp object, experts testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Richard Fukumoto told the grand jury that Wong died of "traumatic shock." 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury later indicted Morgan on murder, kidnaping and sexual assault 
charges and two special-circumstance allegations that make him eligible for the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Julian Bailey said he believes the videotapes will be a key 
issue at trial -- but will ultimately help the defense. Bailey said his client 
left the club with Wong but that the two then went their separate ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Morgan has from the beginning maintained his innocence in this case, and 
I want people to remember that he is presumed innocent in this case," Bailey 
said. "He is denying that it is him on the videotape. . . . He honestly 
believes when everything comes out at trial it will be shown he wasn't the one 
who did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan and Wong left the nightclub together about 1 a.m. Rebecca Klein, 22, a 
friend of Wong's, testified before the grand jury that Morgan, a 5-foot-10 
bodybuilder, seemed in a hurry and had "ahold of both of (Wong's) hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Lewis R. Rosenblum told the grand jury as it reviewed the 
videotapes that a man seen pulling a woman is believed to be Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 The male figure is later seen hunched over the woman on a small staircase and 
then dragging her into an enclosed area, where a tree partially blocks the 
camera's view. The man believed to be Morgan leaves and returns to the 
enclosure twice, the transcripts show. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenblum could not be reached for comment late Monday. According to the 
transcripts, he acknowledged to the grand jury that the videotapes do not 
always provide clear shots of the attack but said there was still ample 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "There should be no question in anyone's mind that this is the video as he was 
walking Miss Wong to her death," Rosenblum told the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor also noted that the assailant is seen leaning against a 
radiator pipe, the spot where Morgan's print was found. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a very fateful mistake for Mr. Morgan," Rosenblum told the jurors. 
"When he touched that radiator, he sealed his fate." 
</P>
<P>
 No murder weapon or bloodied clothing have been found, according to the 
transcript. 
</P>
<P>
 An unidentified woman who said she is Morgan's girlfriend contends that she 
was driving Morgan home at the time of the killing.

LAGUNA FIRE SUSPECT'S ALIBI APPEARS SOLID; INQUIRY: O.C. INVESTIGATORS REVIEW 
RECORDS, PHOTOGRAPHS AND FINGERPRINTS AT MEXICAN PRISON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOREEN CARVAJAL and MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County district attorney's office investigators on Monday apparently 
confirmed that the man accused of setting last year's devastating Laguna Beach 
fire was confined in a Mexican prison 1,200 miles away at the time, the 
prison's warden said. 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing prison logs, medical records, photographs and fingerprints, as 
well as interviewing the man's cellmates and prison guards, who were shown the 
man's photograph, the investigators remarked "we are talking about the same 
person," Olga Leticia Aguayo, the director of the prison, quoted one of the 
investigators as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Maurice Evans said investigators are still looking 
into the alibi of Jose Soto Martinez, 26, who was imprisoned in Mexico under 
the name of Jaime Saille Higuera, which the district attorney's office knew as 
an alias Martinez had employed in the past. He said he expects a decision to be 
made this week on whether or not to drop the Laguna Beach arson charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Information has come to our attention, since we filed the case, indicating 
that perhaps Mr. Martinez did not set the fire and was in prison in Mexico. We 
are investigating Mr. Martinez's alibi," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this development, Martinez was arraigned Monday for allegedly setting 
the Laguna Beach fire, which occurred Oct. 27 of last year, damaging or 
destroying 441 homes and causing $528 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing in Municipal Court in Laguna Niguel, the man known to Orange County 
authorities as Martinez entered a plea of not guilty. Officials from the 
district attorney's office said that, after conferring with their investigators 
in Mexico, they tried unsuccessfully to postpone the arraignment at which 
Martinez was formally notified of the charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
 At the arraignment, Deputy Public Defender Jim Egar, who was representing 
Martinez at the hearing, angrily denounced law enforcement officials for 
repeatedly interrogating the defendant without his attorney being present. He 
said Martinez has had an attorney since one was appointed for him in Fullerton 
Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez's Mexican prison record was confirmed just four days after Dist. 
Atty. Michael R. Capizzi, Orange Fire Chief Larry J. Holms and other law 
enforcement officials held an elaborate news conference to announce that they 
had captured the man who "willingly and maliciously" set one of the nation's 
costliest and most horrifying fires. 
</P>
<P>
 News that Martinez may no longer be a suspect in the case upset and 
disappointed Laguna residents and prompted Martinez's public defender to 
criticize the district attorney's office for filing a criminal complaint before 
it had thoroughly investigated the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's looks like they were a little premature," said Deputy Public Defender 
Frank Ospino, who is also representing Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez became a suspect in the Laguna fire after he was arrested Sept. 16 on 
suspicion of starting three fires in Fullerton. Martinez told investigators he 
lit the Fullerton fire as well as other "big fires" including Laguna's and one 
in Riverside County last month. He said he started the Laguna fire to commune 
with a demon god named "Gotam." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Martinez's confession seemed bizarre, investigators said they took 
him seriously because of detailed information they say he gave about the fire. 
Martinez had led investigators to the exact flash point of the blaze and told 
them that no accelerants -- only matches -- were used, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi announced at Friday's news conference that prosecutors had ample 
evidence against Martinez and that they were "comfortable" they had the man 
"responsible" for the fires. 
</P>
<P>
 But the case against Martinez started to unravel less then 24 hours later when 
his mother, Teresa Campos, said that her son confessed to the crimes because he 
was afraid that he had been marked for death by Mexican mobsters and that he 
suffers from mental problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hallucinates," said Campos, who -- along with other family members -- 
attended Martinez's court hearing Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos, who lives in Fullerton, said she could have proved to authorities that 
her son had an alibi, but she was only contacted by law enforcement officials 
on Saturday, after charges were filed and the news conference held. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos had even contacted Fullerton police Sept. 19 to tell them that her son, 
whose real name she said is Jaime Saille, was missing. She gave police a 
photograph of her son, but they did not immediately realize that the man she 
said was Saille was the man they had in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 She added that she too is in contact with Mexican officials who are supplying 
her with information that she hopes will free her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm almost certain that he's going to be released," she said, "I will soon 
have in my hands the proof that he didn't do it. . . . I'm expecting it any 
second." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if her son would recant the confession he apparently gave authorities, 
Campos said, "Yes. . . . He told me he told the police that he set the fire 
only because he didn't want to spend all his life in the streets hiding from 
somebody. He said, 'I did it because I wanted to stay in prison longer -- for 
protection.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they first became aware of Martinez's alibi Saturday, after 
Campos was quoted in a newspaper as saying her son could not have set the fire 
because he was in prison in Mexico. Investigators were sent to interview Campos 
that same day and to the prison in Mazatlan Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Orange County district attorney's investigators spent almost four hours in 
the walled Mazatlan prison Monday morning, in search of information to verify 
or disprove Campos's claim. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of the time, they huddled in the office of Aguayo, the prison warden 
and director, who said the investigators compared the records of the man they 
know as Jose Soto Martinez with those of Jaime Saille Higuera. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigators showed Aguayo a grainy photograph of a sullen, unsmiling 
Martinez, whom Aguayo said she immediately recognized as her former prisoner, 
Saille. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Saille was a petty thief who had been jailed from May 15, 1993 -- 
five months before the Laguna fire -- until July 8, 1994 -- eight months after 
the fire. He had been convicted of burglary of a residence, where he reportedly 
stole some radios. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Aguayo, prisoners from Saille's cellblock also told 
investigators that the man in the picture was the same quiet prisoner who had 
lived among them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never gave us a problem. He was very tranquil," said the prison's 
commander, Marduk Urenda, who said that Saille was the kind of prisoner who 
avoided fights. 
</P>
<P>
 When Saille first arrived in the prison in 1993, he underwent a medical 
examination and a doctor noted in prison records Saille's complaint about being 
haunted by ghosts and spirits. According to Aguayo, the medical report also 
indicated that Saille admitted that he was a drug user since the age of 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Saille never tried to escape from the prison, which holds about 1,080 inmates, 
added Aguayo. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she is convinced that Saille couldn't have slipped out of the jail to 
California, because of the daily system of checking prisoners in the morning 
and in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the Laguna fire charge against Martinez is dropped, he will still face 
charges of setting three fires in Fullerton, district attorney officials said. 
Riverside officials said they consider Martinez a suspect in the Aug. 5 fire at 
Green River. Martinez family members, however, have offered another alibi, 
claiming that he was with them when the Riverside fire broke out. 
</P>
<P>
 As word spread that Martinez may not be the Laguna Beach arsonist, many fire 
victims said they were disappointed but did not want an innocent man to be 
wrongly convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsha Bode, director of the Laguna Fire Relief Coalition, said she was 
disappointed. She said knowing who was responsible for the devastating blaze 
would have aided the fire victims' recovery by ending one aspect of the 
uncertainty that has plagued many in the fire's wake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like false hopes. It's too bad to find out it's not true," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach Mayor Ann Christoph agreed: "The idea of kind of closing the 
chapter (on the fire) was somewhat of a consolation. And close to the 
anniversary date, it would have been nice." 
</P>
<P>
 But if Martinez could not have sparked the fire, "it's probably good to find 
out right now rather than later," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, I don't think anyone wants to see the wrong person in jail for a 
crime if they are not the responsible party," said Laguna Beach Police Chief 
Neil J. Purcell Jr., who also attended the district attorney's news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach Councilwoman Lida Lenney, who was mayor of Laguna at the time of 
the fire, said initially she was "very excited when we thought they had caught 
the arsonist. We suffered a terrible trauma and it would be nice to know that 
whoever caused that trauma wouldn't be able to do it again." 
</P>
<P>
 "But I began to be terribly concerned whether they had the right man. As our 
police chief said, we don't want the wrong man sitting in jail," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A pretrial hearing for Martinez was set for Wednesday and a preliminary 
hearing is scheduled for Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Egar said that his office intends to send its own investigator to Mexico 
Tuesday to gather all relevant jail documents on Saille from the prison in 
Mazatlan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure the information, including fingerprints that the 
district attorney's office may have collected, are of the same person," Egar 
said. "We will send our own investigators to maintain the authenticity of the 
information that the district attorney's office may have gotten down there." 
</P>
<P>
 Egar carefully avoided answering all questions relating to Martinez's 
confessions, or to prosecutors' assertions that he was able to take 
investigators to the exact point where fire department officials believe the 
Laguna Beach fire was started. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what his client had told him regarding his whereabouts during the fire, 
Egar said, "There are attorney-client privilege issues, and I'm certainly not 
about to divulge them and tell you the nature of our conversations or any 
information that we've learned in regard to this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Egar said that he had only inherited the Martinez case the day before the 
arraignment, and he didn't want to risk any misstatements in answering such 
questions.

 Mrs. Nelson died of congestive heart failure Sunday afternoon in her Laguna 
Beach home with her son, David, and his wife, Yvonne, at her bedside. 
</P>
<P>
 "David was holding her hand," her daughter-in-law said. "She fell asleep and 
passed away peacefully." 
</P>
<P>
 The demure and highly respected Mrs. Nelson, once America's favorite 
housewife, had lived in quiet retirement for many years. She had remained 
generally out of public view since her husband's death from cancer in 1975 and 
the 1986 air crash that claimed her other son, Rick, a popular rock 'n' roll 
performer long after "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" went off the air. 
Her rare public appearances late in life could force some comedians to clean up 
their tawdry material out of respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Nelson had been admitted to South Coast Medical Center in Laguna Beach in 
late August suffering from congestive heart failure and had long battled 
emphysema. Unknown to her many fans, she had smoked cigarettes for years. She 
was released from the hospital Friday at her request, after her condition was 
reported stabilized. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked last month if she were in good spirits, her son David replied: "She 
hasn't been in good spirits since Dad died." 
</P>
<P>
 With Ozzie as the helpful, willing but sometimes befuddled husband and Harriet 
as his knowing, soft-spoken spouse who never strayed far from the kitchen, the 
Nelsons became a weekly symbol of a simpler, gentler America. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet," which began on radio in 1944 and aired 
on television from 1952 to 1966, is the longest-running family sitcom in TV 
history. In the process of producing 435 episodes, the Nelsons became an 
American institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Nelson set an example of "honesty, warmth, goodness and understanding," 
said Grace Boyd of Dana Point, widow of actor and entertainer William Boyd or 
"Hopalong Cassidy" and a friend of Harriet's for 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't just a part she was playing. It was real. I don't know of anybody 
who didn't love her." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd said she met Mrs. Nelson in New York City in the 1930s when Mrs. Nelson 
was a successful singer at the Hollywood Restaurant, one of Manhattan's top 
nightclubs, and Boyd worked as a dancer at the Paradise Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think her biggest contribution was just being Harriet," she said. "She and 
Ozzie were an example to everybody. It was a total commitment that people don't 
want to do too much of now." 
</P>
<P>
 Former dancer Buddy Ebsen of Palos Verdes once performed in Detroit to the 
music of Ozzie Nelson's orchestra and later played the part of Mrs. Nelson's 
husband in a television feature. 
</P>
<P>
 Ebsen said she and Ozzie showed what an American family could be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Family values -- it's what everyone is looking for today, and what we don't 
have enough of." In a New Yorker cartoon from the 1960s, a middle-aged couple 
is shown watching television when the wife tells the husband: "I'll make a deal 
with you. I'll try to be more like Harriet if you try to be more like Ozzie." 
</P>
<P>
 Two decades after the show was canceled, people would still approach Harriet 
and say, "Aren't you Ozzie and Harriet?" She would always laugh and say, "Well, 
I'm one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedian and talk show host Joey Bishop, who crossed paths with the Nelsons at 
Beverly Hills parties in the late '50s, said one of the most striking things 
about Harriet was her unaffectedness. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very successful, a big star, but there was absolutely nothing phony 
about her," said Bishop of Newport Beach. "She was so real." 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Jack Wagner of Anaheim played Jack, the malt-shop proprietor, on the 
show with the Nelsons for 14 years. Wagner called her "a total professional at 
all times." 
</P>
<P>
 "She was always very sweet and she always knew her lines." 
</P>
<P>
 Harriet Hilliard, born Harriet Louise Snyder in Des Moines, Iowa, was the 
daughter of theatrical parents who plied the Midwestern theater circuit. She 
made her theater debut at the age of 6 weeks when her mother carried her on 
stage in "Heir to the Horrah" and had her first speaking role when she was 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Following her mother to New York after her parents separated, Harriet quit 
high school three months shy of graduating to join the Corps de Ballet at the 
Capitol Theater on Broadway. In 1927, when she was 17, she was hired by 
vaudeville comic Ken Murray to be his straight woman. For the next year, she 
worked with Murray and danced in the Harry Carroll Revue, the first vaudeville 
unit to go out on the Radio Keith Orpheum circuit, playing two shows a day. She 
later worked as straight woman for comedian Bert Lahr and played the Palace 
Theater four times. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1931, Harriet was hired to do a specialty dance act at the Hollywood 
Restaurant, one of Manhattan's top nightclubs. She was soon serving as mistress 
of ceremonies and working in production numbers at the club. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, Ozzie Nelson hired her to be the vocalist with his popular dance 
band. They were an instant hit with the young Westchester, N.Y., crowd during 
their first engagement at the famed Glen Island Casino. There, they began doing 
humorous duets, which Ozzie wrote, and it was not long before they became a 
couple off stage as well as on. They were married in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
 Harriet made her motion picture debut in "Follow the Fleet" with Ginger Rogers 
and Fred Astaire in 1936. Although she appeared in several other pictures over 
the next few years, her priority was being with Ozzie and starting a family. 
</P>
<P>
 Having grown up in show business, she once said, "I know there's one thing 
that's important and that's your family." 
</P>
<P>
 In a business notorious for its divorce rates, the Nelsons' successful 
marriage was something of a riddle, Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To see people stay married was unique," Boyd said. "And to see them stay 
married under those circumstances where they work together and live together 
and they're never separated was especially so. . . . It worked because they 
both had good heads on them and because there was never any question that they 
were going to be together." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Ozzie and Harriet achieved their greatest early success on radio, 
beginning with their regular appearances on comic Joe Penner's "Baker's 
Broadcast" out of New York in the early 1930s. In the early '40s, Ozzie, 
Harriet and the band joined Red Skelton's new radio show in Hollywood. Harriet 
sang on the show and worked with Skelton in comedy sketches. She played Daisy 
June opposite Red's Klem Kadiddlehopper, Calamity Jane opposite his Dead-Eye 
and the mother of Junior, "the mean widdle kid." 
</P>
<P>
 When Skelton was drafted into the Army in 1944, the Nelsons began their own 
radio show. "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" began as a day in the life of 
bandleader Ozzie Nelson and his vocalist wife, Harriet Hilliard. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, the radio series featured child actors because the patriarch said 
he "didn't want any inflated egos at the dinner table." But in 1949, Ozzie -- 
who wrote much of their material himself -- gave in and with Harriet's 
blessings let the boys portray themselves, which they continued to do on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Many reflected that the only things that really changed when the Nelsons 
switched mediums were the voices of Dave and Rick. 
</P>
<P>
 On both radio and television, Ozzie portrayed the stubborn husband and father 
who tried to persuade his wife that men were superior by nature, both 
physically and mentally. She was the forbearing spouse who never argued but 
always proved him wrong, in one way or another. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the radio Nelsons, their TV counterparts increasingly became embroiled 
in the growing pains of the two boys. Rick went from a kid with a crew-cut to a 
singing idol. The more staid David attended law school and went into practice. 
And when they both married in real life, their wives were brought into the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 The closeness that Americans sensed from their favorite TV family was not 
coincidental. The Nelsons themselves were described as a tightknit, loving 
bunch who never let their show business success cripple their home life. 
</P>
<P>
 Harriet Nelson liked to tell of the time her then teen-age grandson, Sam, once 
the subject of a bitter custody battle between Rick Nelson's in-laws and Rick's 
widow, Kris, told her, "Grandma, this (the Laguna property) is the nicest house 
in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Later her granddaughter, actress Tracy Nelson, explained to her what her 
brother had meant: 
</P>
<P>
 "You're a constant to us," she said. "No matter what comes and goes, you're 
always here." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, Ozzie and Harriet -- their children now grown and on their own -- 
returned to TV with a syndicated series called "Ozzie's Girls" in which they 
took in two college women as boarders. David Nelson produced the half-hour 
series but Ozzie became ill and it survived only one season. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a memento of sorts that remained from the show, however. It was a 
framed photo of the Nelsons, taken shortly before they married in 1935. The 
picture rested atop an antique oak table in the Laguna Beach home where Harriet 
Nelson sought solace after her husband's death. 
</P>
<P>
 The frame was engraved: "Ozzie's Girl." 
</P>
<P>
 During her years in Laguna Beach, Mrs. Nelson became a supporter of the South 
Coast Medical Center and the Laguna Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was such a wonderful woman," said former playhouse executive director 
Douglas Rowe of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would come and see the shows and then she'd send us flowers." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Nelson is survived by her son, David, nine grandchildren and one 
great-grandchild. At her request, a private memorial service will be held.

TV'S HARRIET NELSON DIES AT LAGUNA HOME; FIRST PERSON: FAMILY CAME FIRST. 
DEATHS OF HUSBAND OZZIE AND SON RICK WERE OVERWHELMING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It was unnerving talking to Harriet Nelson about something so private as her 
overwhelming grief after Ozzie died. 
</P>
<P>
 You just don't expect it from someone you grew up watching on television, 
especially the cheery woman who personified American motherhood to a 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
 But here we sat on the patio of her home overlooking the beach in South Laguna 
in 1981, her eyes welling up, as she talked publicly for the first time about 
the impact of Ozzie's death of cancer six years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were almost like one person, and I don't know that it should be that way," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then she had not gotten over losing her husband of nearly 40 years and 
Harriet, who died Sunday at age 85, never really would. 
</P>
<P>
 For 14 seasons, between 1952 and 1966, the TV Nelsons lived a seemingly 
idyllic life in which their problems generally were no more serious than a 
simple misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 As latter-day critics are wont to complain, the white picket fence world of 
'50s sitcoms bore no resemblance to real life, especially the interminably 
happy Nelson home. They're right, of course. Not even the real Nelson family 
was so blessed. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Harriet often said, "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" was intended 
as entertainment, not a documentary on American family life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get upset at the lack of understanding when the critics relate the show to 
today's families," she told me during a later talk. "They are annoyed that we 
didn't deal yesterday with today's problems. I think it's silly." 
</P>
<P>
 That critics would seemingly take particular delight in attacking "Ozzie and 
Harriet" makes sense. After all, how many real-life families played 
"themselves" on TV each week? 
</P>
<P>
 That television-bred familiarity made Harriet Nelson one of the most 
recognizable mother figures in TV history, a fact that she good-naturedly 
acknowledged well into her 80s by joking, "Nobody recognizes me without an 
apron and a coffeepot in my hand." 
</P>
<P>
 The truth was that during the making of the TV series, Harriet Nelson put in a 
full day at the studio, and when she and Ozzie returned home from work, dinner 
already had been prepared by their longtime housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 There was, as I would discover, much more to Harriet Nelson than the 
stereotypical TV image. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter of theatrical parents who played the Midwest stock company 
circuit, she had her first speaking role on stage at age 3. She was dancing and 
singing in a popular Manhattan nightclub in 1932 when bandleader Ozzie Nelson 
hired her to be his vocalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Harriet made her movie debut in "Follow the Fleet" with Fred Astaire and 
Ginger Rogers in 1936 and played straight woman to comedian Red Skelton on his 
radio program in the early '40s -- before the radio debut of "The Adventures of 
Ozzie and Harriet" in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd learn all that -- and more -- during long interview sessions with her in 
the late '80s. That was after she authorized me to write a TV nostalgia book on 
the Nelsons' heyday as "America's favorite family." 
</P>
<P>
 I wrote a letter to her proposing the book on the morning of Dec. 31, 1985. 
That night, I, along with millions of other Americans, was stunned to hear on 
the 6 o'clock news that Rick Nelson had been killed in a plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, I hadn't mailed the letter that day and I held off mailing it for 
another 10 months; it just didn't seem right so soon after Harriet's latest 
loss. After I mailed it, Harriet called and said she had turned down many book 
offers over the years. Knowing the tell-all nature of contemporary book 
publishing, she had no interest in participating in a biography. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what they want, and I won't do it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she had no problem with a book that would deal with the family's TV show 
years, a time when her "boys" were still young, a time before divorces and 
tabloid innuendoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, though, she wanted to do the book for Ozzie's sake -- to give him 
the recognition she felt he justly deserved for his role as a television 
pioneer. Unlike his TV character, who seemingly had no job whatsoever, Ozzie 
produced and directed "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet," overseeing every 
aspect of the show from casting to writing to the music. 
</P>
<P>
 And so began a working relationship that blossomed into a friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 I spent many afternoons sitting with her on the white sofa in her living room, 
a tape recorder on the coffee table catching her reminiscences. Then we 
discovered it was more comfortable at the dining room table. 
</P>
<P>
 She'd always have coffee ready when I arrived and would ask if I had eaten 
lunch. I always declined her offer of food, but one time I accepted. And if I 
was expecting something homemade from the kitchen of one of America's most 
famous housewives, she surprised me with sandwiches she had bought from her 
favorite deli down Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The interviews were interspersed with occasional phone calls. The calls were 
always cheerful, as she'd fill me in on the doings of David or her 
grandchildren. Once, she had gone to Disneyland with granddaughter Tracy Nelson 
and a group of Tracy's young girlfriends and laughingly boasted that "we closed 
the place down." 
</P>
<P>
 But she sounded terribly upset another time I called her. Just hours earlier a 
grease fire on her stove had caused extensive damage to her kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been having a rough day," she confessed. I had never heard her so down. 
After hanging up, I impulsively called a Laguna florist and ordered a bouquet 
of spring flowers delivered to her. (After nearly 20 years of marriage, I knew 
the healing effect of flowers.) 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of hours later, the phone rang. It was Harriet, sounding her usually 
upbeat and cheerful self as she thanked me for the flowers. "You made my day," 
she said, then joked: "You tell your mother I'm going to adopt you." 
</P>
<P>
 Coming from Harriet Nelson, it somehow seemed the ultimate benediction. 
</P>
<P>
 Our "Ozzie and Harriet" TV show book, alas, never sold. And not for a lack of 
trying. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it generated interest among several publishers, the overriding 
response was that the show's time had passed and it had not achieved cult 
status, a la "Gilligan's Island" or "Mr. Ed." Said one young editor: "Now, if 
it were about 'The Brady Bunch'. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 When it was clear the book wouldn't sell, our phone chats became less 
frequent. 
</P>
<P>
 Battling emphysema over the past two years, Harriet was unable to come to the 
phone the couple of times I called. I missed our talks and found it hard to 
picture her less than vital. Harriet Nelson succumbing to old age? It just 
didn't seem possible. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a more upbeat image I like to conjure up when I think of Harriet. 
</P>
<P>
 As I was leaving after one of my last visits, the phone rang. It was her son, 
David. Walking toward the door, I heard her throaty chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's how I'd like to remember her: Old age, illness, demons and 
tragedies at bay. Like a family sitcom from the '50s. Forever upbeat. Forever 
cheery. Forever Harriet Nelson.

LEARNING HIS LESSON THE HARD WAY; RANCHO ALAMITOS' ALLEN FINDS THAT ACADEMIC 
SKILLS AS WELL AS ATHLETIC ABILITY ARE NEEDED FOR A SCHOLARSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The letters for Kevin Allen began piling up in Rancho Alamitos football Coach 
Doug Case's office last fall, about the time Allen was streaking past defenses 
during the Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters kept coming in the spring and summer. Even last week, Case 
received seven more from Pacific 10 and Big Eight schools. But the letters 
might as well be addressed to Santa Claus, because now they are serving only as 
mementos. 
</P>
<P>
 Painful mementos. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, a 5-foot-9, 165-pound running back/receiver, is one of the county's 
more talented and electrifying players. Unfortunately, his football skills 
haven't much helped in the classroom, where Allen is so far behind in his core 
requirements for college that he has stopped trying to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin's main problem is application," Case said. "Obviously, he's a heavily 
recruited player, but he doesn't have the grades for Division I football. I 
think he knows the handwriting is on the wall. I think he knows he's going to 
continue his career at a junior college." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if he were on pace to finish his core classes, Allen would be stopped in 
his tracks by the Scholastic Aptitude Test, one of two standardized tests used 
by the NCAA to determine athletic eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 While most college-bound seniors already have taken the test, Allen has yet to 
schedule it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of scared and nervous to take the SAT because I know that I haven't 
studied for it," Allen said. "I don't want to know the results, because I know 
I'm not ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, who has rushed for 349 yards and five touchdowns this season, 
acknowledges he is not ready for much of anything, except perhaps a football 
career. He has coasted through high school, hoping for handouts that never 
came. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I got into high school, I just thought that I could come in and play ball 
and the teachers would just hand me my grades," Allen said. "But it doesn't 
work like that. You have to strive hard for the grades." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen may have learned his hardest lesson in Case's history class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought since he was my coach he would give me just a little slack, but it 
didn't work like that," Allen said. "He was harder on me because I was a 
ballplayer and he knows that I had a chance to get a scholarship. But he also 
knows that you have to put in the effort. I really wasn't working that hard in 
his class." 
</P>
<P>
 So Case gave Allen the grade he thought the student earned, a "D". 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't do any of his work," Case said. "I wasn't going to gift him the 
grade." 
</P>
<P>
 If it wasn't for an "A" in a summer school body shop class, Allen would not 
have been eligible to play his senior season. The "A" raised Allen's 
grade-point average to exactly 2.0, the minimum requirement for eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 And what if Allen had not been able to play this season, or last season, or 
ever? Would it have affected his academic career? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be a better student because I wouldn't have to think about the next game 
and the next opponent," Allen said. "All the stress about playing this 
position, that position. . . . But that's really just an excuse. I guess it's 
my fault that I'm not getting the grades I should be getting. I just blame it 
on myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Case said the three hours a day football players spend on the practice field 
and in the weight and film rooms doesn't help academic performance, but it 
doesn't prevent someone from excelling in the classroom either. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are only so many hours in a day, but you can always find time to 
study," Case said. "They just need to schedule their study time better. I just 
think if people apply themselves better, they achieve more. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . We don't ask an impossible task of students in high school. I don't 
believe in osmosis. You can't put the book under the pillow and suddenly wake 
up smart." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a student that doesn't play football can do the work, why can't a student 
that plays football do it?" he said. "I don't think it's that hard on the 
student. I just don't study that often. I know that I could do the work, but I 
just don't." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been hard for Allen at home, where he lives with his grandfather and 
his older brother. Allen's father moved out when he was 3 and his mother moved 
to San Diego last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom pushed me every day," Allen said. "She'd ask me where my books were 
and if my homework was done. My grandpa is a little slack, but he still asks 
me, 'Where's your homework? Did you do it?' Of course I'm going to say yes, but 
sometimes I don't really do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he still talks to his mother, Allen said he rarely lets anybody else in 
on his problems at school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't talk to people about things like that," he said. "I just seem to 
keep that stuff to myself." 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone has tried to fill Allen's father's shoes, it's Case, who has 
constantly reminded his star running back/receiver to keep up with his classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear lectures every day from Coach, but it just seems like it goes in one 
ear and out the other," Allen said. "I'm starting to listen and do my work." 
</P>
<P>
 But Allen knows he started listening too late. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of frustrating because I know I'm good enough to go to a good 
college," he said. "The only thing holding me back is my grades and maybe my 
size. I just wish I could have my freshman year back so I could start from the 
beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Case hopes his freshmen are listening. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get them early to make sure they get their core done," Case said. 
"They fall behind so early." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Allen is their example.

 It's student -athlete, not athlete-student. There's no 
"which-came-first-the-chicken-or-the-egg" question about it. 
</P>
<P>
 If a high school athlete doesn't pay sufficient attention to his academics, he 
won't be an athlete for long. The California Interscholastic Federation and 
Southern Section high school governing bodies see to that. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIF's Constitution and By-Laws state that to be eligible to play sports, a 
student must, among other things, have "maintained during the previous grading 
period a minimum of passing grades, which is defined as at least a 2.0 
grade-point average in all enrolled courses on a 4.0 scale." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the minimum. Individual schools are allowed to impose their own 
scholastic rules regarding athletic eligibility as long as "they are not less 
rigid than the minimum requirements of the CIF Southern Section." 
</P>
<P>
 And for those looking forward to competing in college, that governing body -- 
the NCAA -- has minimum academic entrance requirements and an unforgiving 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 48, which went into effect in 1986, requires incoming 
student-athletes to have earned a 2.0 GPA in high school core classes and score 
a minimum of 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test or 17 on the American College 
Testing examination. The college landscape has been littered with Prop. 48 
casualties over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 16, which takes effect in the 1995-96 school year, will require 
the same entrance exam test scores as Prop. 48, but raises the minimum GPA to 
2.5. However, a student with a GPA as low as 2.0 can offset that with a higher 
SAT or ACT score. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 16 also increases the number of required high school core classes 
from 11 to 13. Core classes, such as math and English, are mandatory for 
graduation from high school. 
</P>
<P>
 So despite the long hours student-athletes put in before and after school 
practicing their sports, it can all be for naught unless they're also hitting 
their books.

<P>
 I play varsity tennis for Edison High and it helps me do better in school 
because after sitting in the classroom for six hours, I have to get some 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 I need to breathe the fresh air, get my blood going, and hit the ball as hard 
as I can to relieve the frustrations and stress from school. I need to get out 
and see my friends and have some fun. There is no way I could go home and start 
my homework and studying right after school. 
</P>
<P>
 When I come home after practice or a match, I am able to spend the rest of the 
evening on my work and concentrate better because I have had a break.

 Athletics emphasizes academics. A college athlete is referred to as a 
student-athlete. Drawing from personal experience, USC's and UC Santa Barbara's 
athletic teams had a higher graduation rate than any other group on campus. 
Mandatory study halls, tutors available nightly, proctors administering tests 
on the road, players Federal Expressing papers back to USC from Georgetown, and 
GPA standards regulating eligibility all underline the importance athletics 
puts on academics. 
</P>
<P>
 In regards to high school athletics, coaches, parents and guidance counselors, 
in my case, continually emphasized the need of high academic performance, SAT 
scores and core curriculum requirements to be eligible for athletic 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Danley at Katella High School continually monitored his players' academic 
standards and routinely disciplined players who did not perform in the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of a high school athletic team is a public figure forced to uphold 
the reputation of his team and not embarrass himself or his program in the 
classroom, on the court or off the court. For those high school kids who excel 
in the classroom and on the field, the reward is going from being a high school 
athlete to a student-athlete.

 Those involved with athletics, especially in the sports that I coach, are 
above the normal as far as academic performance goes. 
</P>
<P>
 We tend to get the kids who are very bright, very well-disciplined and are 
very productive in and out of the classroom. That makes sports, particularly 
cross-country, a very complementary activity for those kids who do well in 
school because it gives them a high sense of discipline and accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Every kid has a great opportunity to accomplish many goals. What transpires on 
the cross-country course and on the track carries over very well in the 
classroom.

 Athletics and academics go very well together. Athletics is a good discipline 
and motivating force in a young person's life. The combination of athletics and 
academics brings both the mind and the body together in what I consider to be 
perfect harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously academics is utmost in importance and then comes athletics. But 
again, the two of them combined with the proper background as far as family and 
school support can really help a young person prosper.

 Correlation between academics and extracurricular activities, including 
athletics, band, drill team, etc., has proven to be positive. Studies done 
through the years have shown participation will increase self-esteem and the 
desire to succeed. They not only keep many students in school, they also force 
them to work to maintain a minimum grade-point average. As they work to get 
their grades up, many find themselves educationally and strive to excel 
academically, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 These activities are the best weapons in the fight against teen-age 
drug/alcohol abuse, pregnancy, negative gangs, etc. They provide a positive 
direction for the energy that many young adults have. The discipline, sacrifice 
and work ethics that they learn from these activities will be with them for the 
rest of their lives and will be a big asset for a successful future. 
</P>
<P>
 These programs, in conjunction with academics, help provide a well-balanced 
and rounded education that is the basis for the rest of their lives.

 Playing high school sports greatly affects your social life, but if you learn 
how to budget your time, your academic performance isn't affected very much. 
</P>
<P>
 People have a problem of not being able to budget their time and leaving 
behind all the social life. There is plenty of time to do high school work, as 
I've learned. I have a 4.0 grade-point average in high-level classes, and I'm 
still maintaining it even though I play on the varsity football team.

 You should be aware that the statistics say 95% of all high school dropouts 
are not involved in after-school sports or other extracurricular activities. 
Those students who want to do well will do well with the minimum grade-point 
average in mind. It builds character for the young people and shows them how 
hard work and extra work can pay off. 
</P>
<P>
 So I'm all for kids participating in sports, again, with the knowledge that 
they must maintain a minimum GPA to participate. It's not a right, it's a 
privilege. Most student athletes don't abuse the privilege.

 I don't think being involved in sports should affect grades at all. The 
student needs to be determined, work hard and have regimentation to his 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 My son works 15-20 hours a week, carries a grade-point average of 4.22 and 
takes five Advanced Placement classes. He does play varsity football and he 
achieves this by getting five to six hours of sleep each night, and hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 You cannot expect to spend a lot of time watching television or sleeping or 
doing other extra-curricular activities -- that has to all be limited. But 
hard-working people will be rewarded in the end. I really don't think athletics 
affects grades at all, it's the student's attitude.

 Most students involved in extracurricular activities, including sports, are 
good students. Their time schedules are more organized, they are more motivated 
and have clear direction and goals. If athletics has any kind of effect on 
students, I would say that it's a positive one.

 I am a senior at Edison High and as a dual-sport athlete -- water polo in the 
fall and soccer in the winter -- I feel that playing school sports has had a 
positive effect on my academic performance. 
</P>
<P>
 With morning practice for water polo three times a week, afternoon practices 
every day, soccer games (in a recreation league) twice a week, working part 
time and being enrolled in honors and college preparatory classes, there seems 
to be little time left for schoolwork. However, I have discovered that while my 
sports are in season, I am able to budget my time more efficiently than when 
I'm not involved in sports. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Monday mornings I get up at 5:45 and go to water polo practice 
until 7. When I get home, I have time for a shower and breakfast. Since school 
doesn't start until 8:30, I have 30 minutes to review my homework from the 
previous night and look over test material. After school, I have one hour to do 
homework before practice. After practice, I rush home and get ready for work. 
When I return from work at 10 p.m., I know that I only have one hour to do 
homework, otherwise I am too tired to get up at 5:45 the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of my busy schedule, it is easy for me to set my priorities straight 
and budget my time. During the spring, however, when my sports are not in 
season, I seem to procrastinate and put off my homework until the last minute; 
as a result, my grades suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing sports has taught me the importance of dedication, commitment, timing, 
teamwork, responsibility and preparation. I believe that applying these 
sports-related skills into academics can be successfully achieved.

 I know how important sports are to children of any age or at any level. When 
kids are involved with sports, they benefit in many ways, most of all with good 
sportsmanship, citizenship and their academics. It gives them a good sense of 
well-being.

 I participated in band, yearbook and cross-country, worked part time and 
graduated from Katella High with a cumulative GPA in excess of 3.5. I found 
that any extracurricular activity requires the participant to prioritize and 
manage his time in such a manner that he can accomplish all that is asked of 
him. This establishment of priorities and time management provides for a 
valuable lesson that carries far after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 In relation to academics, there is, of course, the minimum GPA requirement to 
participate in extracurricular activities; however, sports in particular teach 
you to set your goal(s) and then strive to achieve them. 
</P>
<P>
 Homework is the "practice" and the test is your "game" or "meet." How you 
practice reflects how you play, and this lesson is applied every day in your 
performance of everything you do. Students often get themselves into more than 
they can handle, but with counseling, coaching and -- most importantly -- 
parental involvement, they can accomplish anything they set their sights on.

 The thing that's missed by not participating in sports is the discipline 
that's involved not only in sports but life. Athletes also learn that they 
should finish what they've started and not be quitters. 
</P>
<P>
 There's so much emphasis put on academics, that a lot of what sports can offer 
is lost. I hope it doesn't get blown out of proportion where kids are being 
left out of sports because of parents because of academic reasons, but it's 
completely up to the coaches to make sure their (players') academics are kept 
up to date.

 I was at one time a scholar athlete, and I enjoyed the atmosphere of 
camaraderie and discipline, but I can't help but make a value judgment on the 
principles of being a student athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 Although being an athlete brings a sense of discipline, along with it comes an 
elitist attitude. Students caught up in the hierarchies of being popular, tend 
to condition themselves to being "jocks." I've seen too many cases where my 
teammates gave up their academic lives to pursue being better football players. 
</P>
<P>
 I encourage improvement and perseverance, working toward a goal, but when 
students cannot prioritize what is more important, they are walking on deadly 
ground. In many cases, students are deluding themselves with a false sense of 
hope, working toward being a first-string quarterback rather than getting an 
'A' in history.

 There's no question, after coaching for quite a while, that the kids who spend 
hour after hour in athletics find the time to get the good grades because they 
know how to make the time. They're in a team sport situation and they learn how 
to use their time wisely.

 Like any activity outside of studies, sports can adversely affect academic 
performance. However, if the activities are balanced, then academic performance 
improves. It keeps the youngster focused. 
</P>

 I've had four youngsters in sports at La Quinta -- two are going through the 
program now -- and the school does an excellent job of encouraging the children 
to balance (academics and athletics).

 It's to the point now where high school athletics is a year-round endeavor. 
It's not like back in the '50s and '60s, when high school sports were strictly 
seasonal. Now, it's conditioning for your particular sport year-round. It takes 
a lot of time, and in order to excel, you've got to put in your time. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's all for naught unless you're doing your book work as well. If you're 
not committed enough, there's no way you can keep up, so your academia comes 
first. If you don't get the grades, you don't get to play. 
</P>
<P>
 So early on, the ones who are not committed are going to weed themselves out 
and you're going to end up with the survivors -- the ones who are willing to 
put in the time. It's a positive thing for those who are really committed.

 As a student-athlete in high school and college, and as a coach, I felt sports 
affected academics in a very positive manner. 
</P>
<P>
 I ran cross-country, and every year at my school, El Modena, we had the 
valedictorian (on the cross-country team). Sports brought out discipline, which 
translated over into the academic program; we knew what we had to do and we did 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was a coach, I always pushed that, and I always thought the kids who 
were in sports were a little more driven. And even those who were not very 
academically inclined did as well as they could because of that inner drive 
that an athlete needs.

MIXED MEDIAHEAD A NEW RALLYING CRY FOR LATINAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For too long, they say, their voices have been ignored, their faces overlooked 
and their stories stereotyped. 
</P>
<P>
 The creators of several new, Los Angeles-based quarterly ethnic magazines are 
hoping to change all that, targeting markets they say are largely untapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Squires, director of the New York-based Ethnic Magazine Coalition, 
notes that most new magazines fail because they are either underfinanced or 
poorly distributed. "To give voice to an ethnic group is . . . empowering," he 
says. "To not have the money or the know-how is not." 
</P>
<P>
 But these local entrepreneurs have accepted the long odds, launching Image, a 
magazine for men of color; Que Linda! an English-language beauty and fitness 
magazine for Latinas, and YOLK, a popular-culture periodical targeting young 
Asian Americans. Times staff writer Michael Quintanilla tells their stories.

 When I was younger, there were not many Latina role models that I could 
identify with. I felt out of place and ignored. -- Linda Guerrero Peebles, 
publisher/editor of Que Linda! in a letter to readers 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Linda Guerrero Peebles did an about-face. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of trying to pass as Anglo -- hiding, denying and lying about her 
Mexican heritage -- she came clean. While attending a college where she was 
surrounded by Latino professors and students, Peebles proudly claimed her Latin 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, as co-publisher and executive editor of Que Linda! (translation: How 
Beautiful!), a fashion, beauty and issue-oriented magazine published in 
English, Peebles is sounding a rallying cry for Latinas. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a perfect world, ethnic publications would not need to exist," she says 
while sitting in her Culver City living room between her dogs, Sumo and Sparky. 
"But we do not live in such a place. We never have." 
</P>
<P>
 Peebles, 26, can attest to that. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father abandoned her mother even before Peebles' birth in Guadalajara, 
Mexico. Her Mexican mother and white stepfather made sacrifices to provide 
their only child with a good education. But the best schools brought the worst 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 She first encountered racism as a child in El Centro. "I was called a wetback, 
a beaner, a spic. I became really ashamed of being Latina. I just felt so alone 
and isolated." 
</P>
<P>
 She remembers ignoring her mother's advice: " 'Don't forget that you are 
Mexican and you have to have pride in who you are.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But "when you're a kid you only care about what your friends think," she says. 
So as a teen-ager, she lied about her ethnicity, telling classmates at a 
private school in Los Banos, north of Fresno, that she was Italian, "because I 
didn't want any trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 While a student at Los Angeles City College, where Latinos were the majority, 
Peebles did some soul-searching and realized that what she used to see as a 
curse -- her Latin culture -- was a blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, while attending Cal State Long Beach -- where she is four 
classes away from earning her journalism degree -- Peebles gathered her Latino 
friends and spoke about her newly discovered Latina pride. Then she pitched her 
vision for Que Linda! 
</P>
<P>
 Although most everyone loved the magazine's concept, naysayers thought it a 
risky business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of my friends told me, 'You're going to lose all your money.' And my 
family was very concerned. They said I was going to work myself to death." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Nick Pliagas, a watchmaker, two other partners and Peebles have 
contributed about $40,000 toward the business, including $15,000 for a 
prototype her volunteer staff of college friends put together. The magazine, 
which made its debut this past summer, is distributed in more than a dozen 
states and is sold through subscription orders and newsstand sales for $2.25 
per issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the money I make I put into the magazine," says Peebles, who works 25 
hours a week as a waitress. When she's not waiting on diners or studying, 
Peebles is at her computer, on the phone with free-lancers, selling advertising 
or scouting for models. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent meeting of a group of professional Latino publicists, Peebles 
defended her magazine's mix of fashion, beauty and social issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinas, she told the group, want beauty tips but also were interested in 
articles about sexuality, teen pregnancy, AIDS, alcoholism and machismo. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time I have felt that doing this magazine was my destiny," she 
says. "I don't want any teen-age girl to experience the shame and pain that I 
went through as a young woman. We have to realize that we need to be proud of 
who we are, color and all."

 It is time for men of color to re-emerge to a position of prominence and 
strength; brought about by ourselves and for ourselves. -- J. Edward Giles III, 
publisher, writing on his mission for Image magazine 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 J. Edward Giles III sits in his "war room" -- an office decorated with kente 
cloth and African art on the walls, including a tribal ceremonial rod for 
fighting off evil spirits. Giles leans forward, mentions his guest spot on a 
recently taped "Donahue" show about black-on-black racism, then stops cold. 
Before he goes on about the present, he wants to bring up the past. 
</P>
<P>
 The year: 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The place: Prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Giles, 32, publisher of Image -- a new magazine he created to "empower the man 
of color" -- spent a year in Chuckawalla Valley State Prison in Blythe and two 
more at the California Institution for Men in Chino, an experience he calls "my 
pit time." 
</P>
<P>
 For Giles, incarceration led to an analysis of the plight of African American 
men, who he says are often bashed as "inherently evil, inherently destructive, 
inherently negative." 
</P>
<P>
 Out of this was born Image, which he says will explore controversial African 
American cultural issues and, he hopes, provide solutions to the problems that 
plague all men of color. The national publication debuted last month with a 
press run of 80,000 and a $2.95 cover price. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in prison it was the most amazing thing," he says. "I met hundreds 
of men like me -- bitter, angry, sad. I met murderers who just got started out 
in life on a destructive path, men who didn't have a chance, guys who never 
heard the words 'I believe in you.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I know from experience what that feels like. 'I believe in you. I care for 
you. I love you,' these things were a void in my life too," adds Giles, whose 
parents divorced when he was 9. "My parents did try to do the best for me. It's 
when they broke up that the violence and the bitterness started." 
</P>
<P>
 But Giles says he persevered, surviving a Compton neighborhood known as "the 
Swamps," where gang violence and drug dealing are commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 After high school, he attended Howard University in Washington, D.C., where he 
studied philosophy. Later, he studied law at the Southern California College of 
Business and Law in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, he found himself on the wrong side of the law. He attacked his wife, 
was charged with injury to spouse and sent to prison. "I deserved to go to 
prison," he says. "I didn't necessarily deserve them throwing the book at me. 
But what I did was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 After serving his sentence, he worked as a legal document analyst for an oil 
company, and later for a law firm, handling worker's compensation and personal 
injury cases as a hearing representative for attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 But he never quit thinking about the magazine. In March, using mostly his own 
money, he formed the company, with offices near Universal Studios, that 
publishes Image. 
</P>
<P>
 He says the magazine will "take back our negative image and reverse it" as 
well as "sever the good from the bad, the truth from the lie." 
</P>
<P>
 A high-quality, beautifully designed periodical, Image will not carry 
advertisements "for counter-productive products such as tobacco and alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
 Not shying from taboo subjects, the premiere issue features the article 
"Nigger, please," which traces the history of the "N-word" and its acceptance 
among some African Americans, in rap music and among white kids who want to be 
known as "wiggers." 
</P>
<P>
 Health and fitness articles, arts and entertainment, and Man-to-Man, a 
first-person column addressed to a man who has affected the writer's life 
positively or negatively, will appear regularly. The first Man-to-Man will 
feature an open letter from a man talking to the rapist who assaulted his 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a publisher. I just knew that the same guys in prison I had met as 
demonic and evil -- as the world wants to tell them that they are -- didn't 
have anyone stand up for them and say, 'Wait a minute, let's talk about some of 
the reasons that we got to this position.' Maybe by doing that we can exorcise 
the demons."

MIXED MEDIA; TO BE YOUNG, HIP AND ASIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For too long, they say, their voices have been ignored, their faces overlooked 
and their stories stereotyped. 
</P>
<P>
 The creators of several new, Los Angeles-based quarterly ethnic magazines are 
hoping to change all that, targeting markets they say are largely untapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Squires, director of the New York-based Ethnic Magazine Coalition, 
notes that most new magazines fail because they are either underfinanced or 
poorly distributed. "To give voice to an ethnic group is . . . empowering," he 
says. "To not have the money or the know-how is not." 
</P>
<P>
 But these local entrepreneurs have accepted the long odds, launching Image, a 
magazine for men of color; Que Linda! an English-language beauty and fitness 
magazine for Latinas, and YOLK, a popular-culture periodical targeting young 
Asian Americans. Times staff writer Michael Quintanilla tells their stories. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 YOLK is a magazine for The New GenerAsian -- young, aware, English-speaking 
Asian Americans like ourselves." -- YOLK Editor Philip W. Chung, writing in his 
column, Editor's Slant 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Philip W. Chung, the 24-year-old editor of YOLK, is talking 'bout his 
"GenerAsian": twentysomething Asian Americans with college degrees, flip phones 
and Wednesday nights reserved for Margaret Cho. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mainstream American magazines really don't know about our community except 
within those stereotypical notions of what Asians are supposed to be like, 
typically passive, going into medical and business professions," says the South 
Korean-born Chung, a former staff writer at the Korea Times English edition. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the one hand a lot of Asians have bought into that stereotype. I know a 
lot of Asians in medical schools and they are miserable. They would rather be 
artists, writers, musicians. But tradition has held them back." 
</P>
<P>
 It is popular culture issues like these that YOLK will not be afraid to 
feature, says chief operations manager Tommy Tam, a 25-year-old Chinese 
American who co-founded the quarterly magazine with Tin Yen, 29, who was born 
in Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Tam hopes to fill what he believes is a void in the young adult, 
English-speaking Asian American market. He got the idea three years ago while a 
student at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are other Asian magazines out there, but they deal with the older, 
established, successful Asian Americans, not the younger generation who is 
trying to find themselves. Hopefully, YOLK will give them an identity through 
our popular culture focus," Tam says. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by one major investor and smaller contributions from others, Tam put 
together a staff and hired a distribution company to circulate 25,000 copies of 
the premiere issue, which made its debut in major U.S. cities last week at 
$3.95 per issue and features comedian and sitcom star Margaret Cho on its 
cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, a photo essay takes a look at Hollywood's top Asian American actors. 
Stories explore the cultural taboos faced by Asian Americans with AIDS, race 
relations between Koreans and Latinos in Los Angeles, the latest in street 
fashion and readers are asked to take the YOLK pop quiz that asks questions 
about Wayne Wang, UCLA, Hiroshima, Amy Tan and Yo-Yo Ma. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our look and our approach to stories will be young, bold, experimental and 
irreverent," says Yen, the graphic designer responsible for YOLK's hip look. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Tu, 22, also Taiwanese American, is YOLK's chief financial officer as well 
as the youngest member of the administrative staff and its only woman. "My hope 
with YOLK is for all Asian Americans, especially women, to realize that they 
don't have to be humble, modest, quiet, subservient rice-lovers. They can be 
whoever they want to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Tazuma, a 29-year-old Japanese American and YOLK's managing editor, came 
up with the name. "YOLK draws a strong reaction. But it simply stands for the 
color of our skin," he says. "It's what connects all Asians."

4,600 DEATHS THAT A SIMPLE YEARLY TEST MIGHT PREVENT; MINORITIES ARE LESS 
LIKELY TO GET PAP SMEARS. WHITE WOMEN OFTEN DON'T GET FOLLOW-UP CARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN, TIMES HEALTH WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During her 20s and 30s, Maria Vasconez faithfully had an annual medical 
checkup, including a Pap smear to screen for cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 And then she stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to get a physical every year and I never had any problems," says the 
Los Angeles hair salon owner, 43. "I had always been very healthy. Nothing was 
ever wrong with me. We don't have cancer in our family. So I didn't see the 
urgency in going to the doctor. Plus, I opened my own business, and I got so 
busy working." 
</P>
<P>
 Then one day -- several years after her last Pap smear -- Vasconez began 
bleeding and made a frantic dash to her doctor's office. Within a week, she 
knew the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 She had cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish someone had told me to get Pap smears every year," Vasconez says. "If 
you are healthy or not, go for checkups." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasconez was treated for her cancer three years ago and is healthy. But 
thousands of other women who eschew regular Pap tests on a regular basis are 
not as lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 About 4,600 U.S. women die of cervical cancer each year. This fact is 
disheartening because cervical cancer deaths would be extremely rare if women 
had regular Pap smears -- which involves collecting a small sample of cells 
from the cervix and examining it for abnormalities. 
</P>
<P>
 "With regular screening, we would see very few cervical cancer deaths," says 
Dr. Cary Presant, immediate past president of the American Cancer Society 
California Division. "When screened regularly, cervical cancer is picked up at 
an early stage when cells are just beginning to change. You can treat localized 
cervical cancer very easily." 
</P>
<P>
 Cervical cancer deaths have dropped dramatically since the 1950s, when Pap 
tests came into widespread use. But officials point to several unrelated 
factors that have stymied attempts to further curtail the death rates, 
including failure among women with abnormal results to seek follow-up care. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 70% of the women who die from cervical cancer have never, or 
rarely, had a Pap smear, studies show. 
</P>
<P>
 Pap smears are crucial to detecting cervical cancer. The Pap test can detect 
abnormal cells long before other symptoms of a problem -- such as bleeding -- 
become apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 It usually takes five or more years for invasive cervical cancer -- cancer 
that has spread beyond the cervix -- to develop. If the cancer is detected when 
it is confined to the cervix, survival rates five years after treatment are 90% 
compared to a 67% five-year survival rate for women whose cancer has spread. 
</P>
<P>
 Various studies, however, suggest that only about 60% of women get Pap smears 
at the recommended intervals. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in Southern California, poor and uninsured women as well as nonwhite 
women are far less likely to obtain an annual Pap smear. 
</P>
<P>
 This statistic is of particular concern because one long-term study showed 
that Latinas in Los Angeles County had more than double the rates of cervical 
cancer compared to whites. Black women also had higher rates than whites. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very, very concerned about this because of the fairly large Latino 
population in Southern California," Presant says. "It's also our impression 
that Latinos are less likely to get Pap smears. One reason may be that there is 
a higher percentage of poor people in the Latino communities. There is also a 
higher portion of Latino women who are (illegal immigrants), and they have poor 
access to health care. There is a cultural barrier as well. Many times, Latino 
women don't feel as comfortable seeking Pap tests." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly cost is a problem, experts say. A pelvic examination including a Pap 
smear can cost $100 or more -- a fee that may not be paid by insurance plans 
that provide little preventive care coverage. One 1993 study of women ages 30 
to 48 found that 43% of the poor women surveyed had received a Pap smear in the 
past year compared to 62% of the well-to-do women. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've probably failed to stress the continuing importance of Pap 
testing," Presant says. "We've been good about mammography testing, and rates 
are improving there. But I think we've fallen down a bit on Pap testing. With 
this low-cost screening program, women can address two of the things -- 
mammography and Pap testing -- that are most important to their bodies." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is equally important, however, that all women seek Pap tests regularly, 
health experts say. Studies show cervical cancer rates are increasing a 
disturbing 3% per year in white women under age 50. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, about 70,000 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed yearly in the 
United States, according to the American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
 "For young white women, the rate is going up slightly, although we don't know 
absolutely why," says Dr. Barry Kramer of the National Cancer Institute. "It 
could be for a variety of reasons. It could be because human papilloma virus 
may be more common than in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Human papilloma virus is a sexually transmitted disease that is epidemic among 
college-age people, especially whites. Some strains of the disease are strongly 
linked to the later development of cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors are eager for more research on the link between HPV and cervical 
cancer, Kramer says. One problem with Pap smears now is that about 10% of all 
test results fall into a vague category that are not quite normal or abnormal. 
But a better understanding of HPV might give doctors a new way to predict which 
women with these hard-to-classify test results are at high risk of developing 
cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers plan to study women with these vague test results who also test 
positive for human papilloma virus to see if having the virus confers a greater 
chance of developing cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the difficulty in classifying some Pap test results, the accuracy of 
the test has improved dramatically in recent years, experts note. In previous 
years, Pap screening was plagued by a high rate of "false negative" results -- 
abnormalities that were missed by lab technicians. But state regulations to 
improve laboratory testing have lowered the error rate, Presant says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know in the past there have been quality control problems in Pap testing. 
But we're much more confident of testing now," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the National Cancer Institute now has a nationwide system to better 
classify abnormal and normal results, Kramer says. The new terminology -- 
called the Bethesda System -- was adopted by the NCI a few years ago to help 
standardize Pap results. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bethesda System has helped us develop a lexicon of terminology that is 
easily understandable," Kramer says. "It puts lesions into more crisp 
categories that are easier for the doctor to act upon. In spite of that, there 
is still uncertainty about how to manage certain lesions." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But deaths from cervical cancer will only decline if consumers, too, take Pap 
tests seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 A new study by the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center showed that as many as 
30% of women who get Pap smears and have abnormal results do not return for 
either their results or follow-up care, says Dr. Celia Kaplan of the Los 
Angeles-based center. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor, uninsured, single and very young women are least likely to follow 
recommendations for follow-up care. 
</P>
<P>
 "People (with abnormal results) are usually referred to another facility for 
treatment, which is a main reason there is a lower return rate," she says. 
"It's usually farther away. It demands another appointment. And you may have to 
take time off from work." 
</P>
<P>
 The study showed that some women, especially those in the country illegally, 
may not give correct addresses or phone numbers to clinics performing the Pap 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wouldn't believe how much this interferes with good medical care," Kaplan 
says. "The problem with the Pap test system is that it only informs you. And 
sometimes it's difficult to locate women for follow-up care. Women should at 
least provide an accurate address. Because if an abnormality is found, you can 
be contacted." Low-Cost Screenings 
</P>
<P>
 To ease the financial burden, the Los Angeles Regional Family Planning Council 
and the American Cancer Society are offering a low-cost Pap Package through 
November that includes a Pap smear and pelvic exam. These examinations -- 
mammography is also available -- will be offered at 350 family planning 
clinics. For information on the program, call (800) ACS-2345. Cervical Cancer 
Rates 
</P>
<P>
 Latinas have more than doubled the rate of invasive cervical cancer compared 
to white women, according to a 1987 survey in Los Angeles County. The higher 
than average rates in Latinas and African American women may be related to how 
often the women receive Pap smears to screen for early signs of cancer. The 
lack of screening may also account for an unusually high death rate for African 
American women who develop cervical cancer. Who Gets Cervical Cancer * Whites:

</P>
<P>
 Women who had sexual intercourse at an early age, have had multiple sexual 
partners or have been infected with human papilloma virus are at higher risk 
for the disease. Smokers are at higher risk.

<P>
 Early signs are abnormal uterine bleeding or spotting and abnormal vaginal 
discharge. Pain and systemic symptoms are much later signs of the disease.

<P>
 An annual Pap smear and pelvic examination are needed for all women older than 
18 and those under 18 who are or have been sexually active. After a woman has 
had three of more annual exams with normal readings, the Pap test may be 
performed less frequently at the discretion of the physician.

<P>
 So your ever-curious offspring are asking questions about anatomy that you 
don't feel quite equipped to answer? 
</P>
<P>
 Not just the standard "Where do babies come from?" query, but much harder 
stuff: What's inside a cell? How strong is hair? Why does your breath look like 
steam on a cold morning?  
</P>
<P>
 English author and biologist Steve Parker, 41, who's also the father of two 
boys, has heard such questions before. Better yet, he provides the answers in 
his new book, "How the Body Works: 100 Ways Parents and Kids Can Share the 
Miracle of the Human Body" (Reader's Digest Books). 
</P>
<P>
 This is no stuffy textbook. It's meant as a family reference book and a 
classroom supplement for youngsters 9 to 15, Parker says. Each of the 10 
sections contains basic information on the skin, the muscles, the skeleton and 
other body parts. But all those facts, figures and theories are brought home by 
100 experiments and projects that make learning about the body truly hands-on. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a section on the body's reactions during activities such as 
driving and sports explains that each reaction involves the same process: a 
sense such as the eyes flashes nerve signals to your brain, which makes a 
decision and sends signals to the muscles about what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, readers are invited to stand in a circle holding hands. As one person 
squeezes the next person's hand, the timer keeps track of how long it takes to 
go around the circle. Next the kids find out if practice decreases reaction 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 During a telephone interview from his home in tiny Southolt, England, Parker 
talked about how the book came together over the past two years and what he 
wanted to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What do you hope kids will learn from this book? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I hope they learn something about how they work inside and that they 
learn to value themselves. I hope they learn that they are robust in some ways 
and delicate in others. And that they have potential. 
</P>
<P>
 We also try to get across the fact that the human body, because we live in it 
every day, becomes so familiar that we might cease to wonder about it or 
appreciate it. We wanted to get people to sort of step outside their own 
bodies, look at them more objectively and find out what a marvelous piece of 
equipment it is and how you really should be taking some care of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did you research the book and what helped you to decide which 
information to include? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I used to be an editor of medical books and I follow the major research 
journals. When information gets into Scientific American, for instance, it's 
fairly molded and accepted. Although we tried to be up-to-date, we didn't 
include theories (that might soon fall out of favor). 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did you field test the projects and experiments? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, once in-house, to make sure they worked. And also in a couple of the 
schools around London. We tried to gather a large group of kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Which are your favorite experiments? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I like the one where we make a model eardrum. The kids really like the 
reaction-time experiment. They were trying to outdo each other. It tuned into a 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Were there some experiments that didn't make it? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There were lots of them we wanted to do but dropped because they were too 
hazardous. We wanted to do (one) on mixing bleach to show how chemical 
reactions happen, but it was thought to be too risky for unsupervised 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did your family help with the book? 
</P>
<P>
 A: They were all involved. My boys -- Alan, 13, and Martin, 9 -- made several 
of the models at home including the eardrum -- although it was not the model 
that was eventually used. My wife, Jane, is a biochemist and helped on the 
practical side, particularly the digestion section. Our two dogs, both 
Labradors, didn't help but benefited indirectly. We were exploring some 
experiments on bones. We got bones (from the butcher) and ended up not 
including those . . . so our dogs got the bones in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you hope to compete with more high-tech information sources? For 
instance, a CD-ROM program called Mayo Clinic AnnaTommy, scheduled for release 
later this year by IVI Publishing, is targeted to children ages 8-12 who are 
curious about the body's system and organs. 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm sure a lot of our experiments will end up on CD-ROM too. But CD-ROM is 
not quite as common, at least in England, as basic computers. Most schools have 
computers, but CD-ROM is still quite rare. And I think CD-ROM and books 
complement each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think kids will read this book straight through or pick and choose? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't think anyone, even me, has read it all the way through in one go. 
We hope, for example, that it will be useful at school in human biology 
classes. Also, people can just dip in. If a teacher is doing something about 
nutrition, for instance, he or she can look at the section on digestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus we have organized lots of the projects for groups. They can come together 
in a classroom, club or at home with the whole family. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Or if someone has a friend over to spend the night? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, that's right, do a bit of practical work on your friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's your next project? 
</P>
<P>
 A: At the moment, I am working on a book about medicine, called "Eyewitness 
Science." It's for older children, probably the teen-age group. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the reward in writing for kids? 
</P>
<P>
 A: To get them interested in science at a relatively early age, to get them to 
appreciate that science isn't just some remote discipline that goes on in a 
laboratory and research studies but does impact daily life. And nowhere can you 
see that more than in the science of your own body. 
</P>
<P>
 I also have written quite a few books on conservation and the aim is to catch 
them young. . . . I do talks in schools, too, and the reward is seeing (that) 
children are so much more environmentally aware and scientifically aware. They 
know about computers, they know about biology, and they know about astronomy 
and the weather and so on in a way that has most of their parents gasping . . . 
because most of them never really learned about science in an entertaining way.

 Science can be fun.  
</P>
<P>
 If this sounds like a piece of nonfiction, guess again. Here's a 15-year-old's 
view of Steve Parker's new book, "How the Body Works: 100 Ways Parents and Kids 
Can Share the Miracle of the Human Body . "  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What You'll See: This is an inventive science book full of fascinating 
information, colorful diagrams and fun experiments for 9- to 15-year-olds. The 
book is geared toward curious kids who like to learn about the way the body 
operates. Although some of the vocabulary is clearly for older kids, the book 
can be easily understood by younger ones. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Author! Author!: Kudos for writing style. Each chapter is set up with an 
opening paragraph that includes a brief overview of the subjects to be 
discussed. From there it's broken down into experiments, facts and definitions. 
I really appreciated the division. It wasn't too much information to digest at 
one time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 EV (Entertainment Value): The author is very witty. He even does the 
impossible and makes the statistical informational enjoyable. This is nothing 
like the typical high school biology book that everyone hates to read. He uses 
analogies to describe everyday objects and emotions. For example, mitochondria, 
he writes, "is a sausage-shaped structure . . . like a power station." If 
someone would have explained it to me that way instead of "mitochondria is an 
organelle in the cytoplasm of cells that functions (blah, blah, blah) . . . " 
when I took biology this past year, I probably would have done better on my 
test. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not Just for Brain Surgeons: The book is challenging, not mind-boggling. 
Everything is very well explained and usually has an accompanying diagram to 
illustrate the point. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Young Dr. Frankensteins: For younger kids, this book might open up a door of 
enthusiasm for science, or at least a better knowledge about themselves. For 
older kids, the book can be used as a backup to something that might otherwise 
be explained in more complicated terms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Step Into My Laboratory: The experiments are ingenious and easy to perform. 
The instructions are clear and the author has a good explanation for each 
result. The materials needed are inexpensive, most of the items can be found in 
the house or at a hardware store. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This Isn't Like My Father's Science Book: What makes the book different from 
most others is that it is put into an entertaining format. Even the 8-year-old 
girl I baby-sit would enjoy it. And at least it's better that watching 
Nickelodeon for 10 hours straight, right? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mom, I Didn't Blow Up the House: Right from the onset, Parker states that some 
of the experiments need adult supervision, and before each experiment he warns 
what precautions should be taken. Either he's wise or he's avoiding a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How About Those Visuals: I love a book with pictures. It reminds me of easier, 
carefree days in third grade. The book explodes with informative illustrations 
-- hundreds of photographs, drawings and microscope images illuminate the 
pages. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What Kids Will Think: Most will have fun flipping through this book and trying 
out some of the experiments with their friends or parents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What Parents Will Think: If you want your child to be a doctor or a scientist, 
buying this book could be a subtle hint.

R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; THE FACES OF ART AND PHILANTHROPY; MASKS AS UNIQUE AS 
THE ARTISTS WHO CREATED THEM ARE AUCTIONED AT BENEFIT FOR THE NEWPORT HARBOR 
ART MUSEUM.

<P>
 Artists put their best faces forward Saturday when masks they created were 
auctioned off at a benefit for the Newport Harbor Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Night of the Masque" was the theme of the buffet and art auction that drew 
more than 400 people to Emporio Armani at South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa. The 
$75-per-person gala netted about $75,000 for the Newport Beach museum. Paper 
Faces 
</P>
<P>
 Guests first gathered around the windows of Emporio Armani, where the 118 
masks were on display. The masks were as individual as the artists themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a chance for artists to take a snapshot of their work and share it 
with us," said Jim Selna, the museum board's new president. 
</P>
<P>
 Artist Lynn Kubasek created a collage mask using pictures of body parts, some 
too private to mention. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a naked face," she said. "I was stripping away the skin." 
</P>
<P>
 Rachel Lachowicz fashioned a mask out of a box filled with face powder, 
Charles Arnoldi used painted tongue depressors and Edward Ruscha covered a 
plastic mask with a collage of eyeballs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The masks are extremely diverse," said Mary Farris, event co-chairwoman. 
"We're thrilled with the results." 
</P>
<P>
 The museum first held a mask auction 10 years ago, and it was such a hit 
organizers decided to bring it back, Farris said. Masks were donated by leading 
contemporary artists, mostly from California. Artists received a plain mask 
form, which they could either decorate or create their own mask from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 Giorgio Armani created a mask as understated as his clothing -- a white face 
with beige coils in place of ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like his style," said Susan Porter, event co-chairwoman. "The masks 
are always eclectic. You never know what's going to come in." Christie's 
conducted a live auction of 17 of the masks. Viola Frey's frowning ceramic mask 
was the top draw; it sold to board member Charles Martin and his wife, Twyla, 
for $6,000. Colorful Crowd 
</P>
<P>
 While many in the artistic crowd tended to favor severe black clothing, one 
artist stood out: Eric Nanson wore a suit in primary colors that had him 
looking like the star of the movie "The Mask." 
</P>
<P>
 "I dressed like this before the movie," he said. Nanson sported a fire engine 
red jacket, electric blue shirt and screaming yellow pants -- not exactly an 
Armani look. A furniture designer, he carved a cartoon-like mask out of wood 
with popping eyeballs and extended tongue. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's festivities included a buffet prepared by Emporio Armani Express 
stocked with penne with tomato and basil, prosciutto formaggio sandwiches, 
skewered Roma tomatoes with mozzarella and other Italian specialties. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds will go to the museum's education and exhibition funds. Among the 
museum's pressing goals: "We'd like to have a timetable for renovating the old 
library next to the museum," Selna said. "It allows us to expand our program." 
</P>
<P>
 Other faces in the crowd were Michael Botwinick, museum director, and his 
wife, Harriet; Gifford Myers, Jerry and Roberta Dauderman, Laddie John Dill, 
Glenn and Jane Fowler, Linda Giannini, Norma Glover, Sam and Pamela Goldstein, 
Ray Johnson, Richard Jonas, Pat and Carl Neisser, Cornelius O'Leary, Tom and 
Mary Catherine Payne, Barbara Peckenpaugh, Herb and Sondra Samuels, Lola Romero 
Seymour, Jay and Linda Young, and Leonard and Madeline Zuckerman. KATHRYN BOLD

MIXED MEDIA; 3 MORE TITLES FOR NEGLECTED READERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For too long, they say, their voices have been ignored, their faces overlooked 
and their stories stereotyped. 
</P>
<P>
 The creators of several new, Los Angeles-based quarterly ethnic magazines are 
hoping to change all that, targeting markets they say are largely untapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Squires, director of the New York-based Ethnic Magazine Coalition, 
notes that most new magazines fail because they are either underfinanced or 
poorly distributed. "To give voice to an ethnic group is . . . empowering," he 
says. "To not have the money or the know-how is not." 
</P>
<P>
 But these local entrepreneurs have accepted the long odds, launching Image, a 
magazine for men of color; Que Linda! an English-language beauty and fitness 
magazine for Latinas, and YOLK, a popular-culture periodical targeting young 
Asian Americans. Times staff writer Michael Quintanilla tells their stories. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two other Los Angeles-based ethnic quarterlies, Unity LA and Latin Style, were 
launched recently. And organizers of United Front, a monthly newspaper written 
by students of color at USC, hope to publish their first issue this month.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Younger Readers: Unity LA Publisher and Editor Shelley Miller says her 
magazine, targeted to 16- to 20-year-olds, is a product of the riots of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 After the riots, Miller, 46, a former school psychologist now in private 
practice, researched her magazine idea by conducting focus groups with more 
than 150 students at 30 high schools. Along the way she assembled writers, 
artists and other students whom she paid to help produce the first issue, 
spending $35,000 of her own money. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller hopes eventually to reach 2 million ethnic teen-agers and young adults 
nationwide through newsstand sales with the first quarterly issue, which sells 
for $2.50 and features a cover story on actress Rosie Perez talking about AIDS 
with Venice High School students. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Latino Entertainment: "We will do poetry and authors, art and literature. We 
hope to open up other people's eyes to our culture," says Walter Martinez, 45, 
publisher and editor of Latin Style, an English-language magazine that will 
focus on Latino art and entertainment in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who also is associate publisher of Venice magazine, wants to give 
Latino readers "a sense of accomplishment among our people," he says. "We 
aren't going to cover the negatives of the world -- others are doing that 
fairly well, thank you." 
</P>
<P>
 The first issue, with comic actor Cheech Marin on its cover, includes stories 
on La Mafia, a Houston-based Tex-Mex musical group, trumpeter Arturo Sandoval 
and the film "Mi Vida Loca." Social issues and, always, Latino celebrities will 
be featured. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have absolute confidence that I can make the magazine work," Martinez says 
about the publication sold for $2.50 on newsstands and through subscriptions. 
"We are a small company backed by investors who believe in the product."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Newspaper for Students: Daniel Ruiz, managing editor of United Front, hopes 
the USC publication for students of color will be more than a free newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want it to be a student movement, not a business-run organization," says 
Ruiz, a 19-year-old sophomore. "We decided to do this out of necessity." 
</P>
<P>
 Last April, Ruiz and several other students of color organized and founded 
United Front, an alternative newspaper that will focus on issues that directly 
affect the campus's ethnic students and the diverse community surrounding USC. 
The monthly publication also will address culture and ethnic entertainment such 
as banda music. 
</P>
<P>
 The unpaid staff hopes to launch the publication later this month with a press 
run of about 10,000. United Front receives no university funds and will be 
supported through advertising or by the students themselves, says Ruiz, the 
group's spokesman. MICHAEL QUINTANILLA

NEW VOCABULARY, OLD EXPRESSION; DANCE: NAI-NI CHEN 'SPEAKS THE TRUTH' BY 
INTEGRATING TRADITIONAL CHINESE MOVEMENT WITH A CONTEMPORARY WESTERN LEXICON. 
HER TROUPE PERFORMS TONIGHT IN CERRITOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nai-Ni Chen has one foot in Taiwan and one in New Jersey, but she's got Peking 
and New York covered, too -- not to mention ancient and contemporary, folk and 
classical. 
</P>
<P>
 Performances by her Nai-Ni Chen Dance Company, tonight and Wednesday at the 
Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, reflect the entire range. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American audience is more familiar with European tradition and culture," 
Chen said from her home in Fort Lee, N. J. "They can appreciate contemporary 
(European dance) because it is on one family tree with ballet. The contemporary 
dance created by this company is something different. It's like me. I have the 
Chinese tradition in my body, then the contemporary happens on my body. In 
order for the audience to appreciate my modern vocabulary, first they must see 
Chinese tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 That tradition, and Chen's program, include two dances popular throughout 
China: "Ribbon Dance," which uses colorful ribbon to represent the clouds and 
rainbows surrounding celestial beings, and "Preamble to the Battle of General 
Kao," an excerpt from Peking Opera utilizing martial arts, acrobatics and dance 
skills. "Fan Dance" is typical of China south of the Yangtze River, while 
"Tai-Ping Drum Dance" comes from the northeastern mountain area. 
</P>
<P>
 The troupe features five dancers of Chinese descent, four who are not. The 
program features four dances of ancient origin, five that are not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditional Chinese dance is very visual, very colorful," Chen said. "It was 
(meant) to entertain the emperor in the palace or for festival celebrations and 
other happy occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a transition to leap into the more artistic (dance). The contemporary is 
(in some ways) more sophisticated, not just entertainment. We are telling you 
something other than just for fun. Like a painting we describe scenery, or a 
poem, or a Chinese legend." 
</P>
<P>
 For the contemporary portion of the show, Chen's "Journey of a Lonely Soul" is 
inspired by Peking Opera, her "Movable Figures" by the shadow puppets popular 
throughout Southeast Asia. The idyllic "Peach Flower Landscape" is based on 
Chinese legend, "Hidden Cove" on the spirited movements of Taiwan, where Chen 
was raised, and "Du (The Passage)" on Buddhist ritual and spiritual 
transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every piece is a part of me," Chen said. " 'Peach Flower Landscape' is 
subtle, very delicate, the female part of me. 'Du' expresses more the warrior 
type of character -- very grounded, earthy, with a lot of strength, another 
part of me I love deeply." As a child, Chen was trained in traditional Chinese 
dance. As a teen, she was exposed to Western ballet, modern dance and jazz. She 
came to the United States in 1982 to study modern dance with Martha Graham, 
later earning a master's degree in dance at New York University. Her company, 
which she formed in 1987, was recently awarded a grant from the National 
Endowment for the Arts to create a dance based on Chinese calligraphy to a new 
score by Joan La Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to integrate both aesthetics, Eastern and Western," Chen said. "My 
dancers and I experiment every day. I believe that if I let movement come out 
naturally from my body, if I speak the truth from my heart, it will express my 
background -- traditional Chinese movement and a Western dance vocabulary." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Nai-Ni Chen Dance Company performs tonight and Wednesday at the Cerritos 
Center for the Performing Arts, 12700 Center Court Drive, Cerritos. 8 p.m. 
Tickets are $20-$35. For youths 16 and under, tickets are $16. Phone (310)

BING WANG'S LONG JOURNEY INTO THE CONCERT HOT SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Within the sprawling fabric of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which kicks off 
its season Thursday, there lurk countless human interest stories -- individual 
stitches in the tapestry. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for instance, the case of Bing Wang, the Philharmonic's newly appointed 
assistant concertmaster. The 27-year-old native of Shanghai came to the United 
States on a scholarship in 1985 and has spent the last 3 1/2 years with the 
Cincinnati Symphony. The distance she's traveled can be counted in more than 
mileage: Wang's career began under a culturally besieged regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in the plush office of Philharmonic Executive Vice President and 
Managing Director Ernest Fleischmann for an interview last week, Wang recalled 
how the repressive conditions of her early training served to strengthen her 
resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 She descends from a strong musical lineage via her violinist parents, who have 
moved with her to Los Angeles. Her father was a violinist and concertmaster 
with the Shanghai Symphony for 25 years, and her mother taught violin. 
</P>
<P>
 Her older brother now plays violin with the Shanghai Symphony, and it was the 
sound of his practicing as a boy, in the family's one-room dwelling, that 
shaped her early musical memories. "I started to sing and hum the music at just 
about the time I started to speak," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the home, though, the musical landscape was limited. "I was born in 
1967, right when the Cultural Revolution started. My father had to stop playing 
the violin. My mother had to stop teaching and play in the Chinese Opera, 
sponsored by Mao Tse Tung's wife. Western music was not allowed to be played." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, many young people were shuttled from cities to farms, for 
"re-education." Many of Wang's friends and relatives, barely into their teens, 
were relocated "to dig the ground, be farmers." Her parents encouraged violin 
studies, so that "if worst came to worst, we could play Chinese music." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the Cultural Revolution ended in 1976, Wang had been studying 
Western repertoire -- heavy on the Mozart -- from the age of 6, undercover. "We 
practiced at home. We wouldn't perform it. You could say we played Western 
music in hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 "The classical and romantic composers were what we heard most in China. The 
more contemporary composers we never even heard of at that time." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Wang didn't even hear that staple of modernism, Stravinsky's "Le 
Sacre du Printemps" -- which is on this week's L.A. Philharmonic program -- 
until she came to the United States to study at the Peabody Conservatory in 
Baltimore. "It was a big shock," she said, laughing. "I can't say if I enjoyed 
it or not, because I didn't have time to hear it. I was too busy counting. I 
thought, 'Gosh, everyone is great. They can play these strange meters.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The impressive caliber of the young Wang's musicianship came to the attention 
of violin virtuoso Berl Senofsky, a professor at Peabody Conservatory who 
visited Shanghai and met her when he taught a master class there. Senofsky 
wound up securing Wang a scholarship to Peabody in 1985. She later spent a 
summer at the Music Academy of the West, and also earned her master's degree at 
the Manhattan School of Music. While in New York, she studied with Glenn 
Dicterow, former concertmaster with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and now with 
the New York Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, Wang's focus has been on working within the ensemble rather 
than the spot-lit life as a soloist. "Everyone's dream is to be a soloist," 
Wang commented. "But at some point in my student career, I just aimed more 
toward an orchestra. I thought if I could be a member of a great orchestra, I 
would feel very good about myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I look at it differently than other people, but being a member of such 
a great ensemble making music, you get a satisfaction that you don't get from 
playing a solo." 
</P>
<P>
 After gaining what she sees as valuable experience as principle second 
violinist in Cincinnati, Wang auditioned for the assistant concertmaster 
position in Los Angeles last May, when she was first seen at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion in a trial period. She also played with the orchestra at the 
Hollywood Bowl this summer, and she had her first taste of what it means to 
help direct the orchestra's string section on the Philharmonic's summer tour of 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was intense, because I was sitting in the hot seat," she said, "but it was 
easier than I expected. It was a great honor to get this position, because it's 
such a great orchestra. I'm looking forward to many years of music-making 
here." In her new job she is assuming the position previously held by Irving 
Geller, who is currently on a one-year sabbatical, and who will play in the 
rotating first violin section when he returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Although attitudes and employment practices are shifting, it's still a rarity 
to see a woman, let alone a young Asian woman, in a position of such prominence 
within a major orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang believes that her will to achieve comes from her family. "Chinese are 
usually very modest. My parents told me, 'We know you are not a virtuoso, but 
you have such a great training and background and you've worked hard. We know 
you can do better.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always aimed for that. That's why, after being in Cincinnati for three 
and a half years, I've kept working and taking auditions. That's kept my level 
up high." 
</P>
<P>
 As for cultural conditions in today's China, Wang noted that "it's more open 
than any time before. Too bad that a lot of us are out." 
</P>
<P>
 "After I came to this country, I realized why people want to come here. You 
work hard and you get rewards. Life keeps getting better. You can really see 
the change. That's not what it's like in China. There are a lot of restrictions 
and policies."

HONESTY FROM A CROSSWISE MISFIT; MORE THAN 64 JOBS LATER, ACTRESS HAS TURNED 
BEING 'BLOWN SIDEWAYS' INTO SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK PACHECO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Actress Claudia Shear, standing in the middle of her cluttered Brooklyn 
apartment, whips off her blouse, exposing her zaftig figure to a male 
photographer and interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't be bothered with going into the next room to change," she says, 
slipping into the embroidered blouse she plans to wear following the Los 
Angeles premiere of her comedy "Blown Sideways Through Life," opening tonight 
at the Coronet Theatre. Posing, she adds, "Self-consciousness is one of the 
very few things I tend to be free of." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it is a nakedly honest moment, as wild and earthy as much of the 
personal odyssey the 32-year-old actress sketches in her one-person play, which 
became last season's runaway Off-Broadway hit. A self-admitted misfit, 
protected by the "constancy of books and the comfort of food," Shear took her 
title from H.G. Wells' observation that while some people are born to a 
specific place and position, others are fated to live "crosswise for the rest 
of the time." 
</P>
<P>
 In the play, the actress dissects her own social dislocation through a look at 
her resume of more than 64 different jobs: from playing Mrs. Rip Van Winkle in 
a pageant to waiting tables at a dozen different restaurants, to proofreading 
legal briefs on a graveyard shift to answering phones in an Eastside Manhattan 
whorehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went through jobs like butter," she recalls in the play. "I went through 
butter like butter" -- at one point putting more than 200 pounds on her small 
frame. 
</P>
<P>
 In an hour of stream-of-consciousness riffs and detailed vignettes, Shear 
melds a hip, raunchy knowingness with a lucid admiration for what really moves 
America, from the ribald shortcuts of callgirls to the ammonia smell of 
swabbing down toilets in a hardware store. The bitter epithets that she flings 
at bosses account for the fact that she was fired from most of her places of 
employment. But the aspiring actress spent enough time at some of them to 
capture the fluorescent-lit poetry of the working girl. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, "Blown Sideways" struck such an immediate visceral nerve when it 
opened in New York last fall that not only was the show greeted with rave 
notices and a glut of personal publicity for its star, but ABC News was so 
impressed with its celebration of the everyday laborer that Peter Jennings 
named Claudia Shear "Person of the Week." For someone who had been dancing 
precariously on the edge up to that point, the overnight success was stunning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tsunami," she says, entertaining three visitors in her cozykitchen 
dominated by a poster of the late producer Joseph Papp (a hero to Shear, as are 
Elvis Costello, Jacques Brel and Buster Keaton). "It was everything you ever 
wanted, but you feel so overwhelmed, you wish people would go away, just for a 
while, and then come back." 
</P>
<P>
 People kept coming, of course, during the Standing Room Only nine-month New 
York run. Thus Shear, on the eve of her Los Angeles engagement, finds herself 
in the ironic position of having achieved relative fame on the wings of a play 
that exalts the common anonymous experience. After all, as Shear puts it, 
"Nobody is just a typist, just a dishwasher, just a cook, just a porter. . . . 
Everyone has at least one story that would stop your heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because of this, the actress takes pains not to sound self-important. 
"Look, I know I'm white, I'm educated, I have nice table manners. I know where 
I fit in. But it's not like, 'I'm cool and you're a working stiff.' I've just 
been very lucky," she says, acknowledging that she is now living the kind of 
struggle-then-success stories she loves best. But has success gone to her head? 
When asked whether Shear is enjoying it, a close friend of hers observes, 
"Claudia's too neurotic. She's circling Saturn. That's why we love her." 
</P>
<P>
 The gale-force energy of "Blown Sideways" is on display as well in her walk-up 
in a working-class Brooklyn neighborhood. Shear manages to do six things at 
once -- talk about her life and career, give a present to her publicist from a 
recent trip to Paris, worry about the water leak under her sink, offer 
croissants and French jam, dust crumbs off the lap of an interviewer, keep an 
eagle eye on what the photographer's doing. It's not surprising to learn later 
that she once lost her house keys, only later to find them in a book she'd left 
in her refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How, then, did such a scatter-brained, albeit intelligent, artist come up with 
such a focused piece of writing? 
</P>
<P>
 Shear gives credit to her friend director Christopher Ashley ("Jeffrey"), who 
developed the play with her at New York Theatre Workshop over a two-year 
period. The opportunity to do so came when she approached James C. Nicola, the 
artistic director of NYTW, for help finding an agent. The director refused, 
suggesting instead that she write something. "Tell them who you are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shear had never written before. Using her voluminous job history as an anchor, 
she portrayed snapshots of her unhappy, rebellious adolescence as the elder of 
two girls born to a Brooklyn firefighter and his wife -- a cosmetics executive. 
Her parents split up when she was 4, and her mother reared Shear and her sister 
by herself. 
</P>
<P>
 There's an oblique reference in the play as well to a "broken heart," and 
Shear laughs long and loud when asked if success has improved her love life 
much. "My love life is impervious to success or failure," she says. Reminded 
that rock composer Pete Townshend once told a reporter for the New York 
Observer that he loved her show so much that he wanted to have sex with her, 
she admits she did, in fact, receive some offers. "I got a letter from a guy in 
prison who'd read my reviews," she says. "And one elderly gentleman said he'd 
take me to lunch at one of the 'finer' restaurants. Does that count?" 
</P>
<P>
 Her heart, for now, belongs to the theater, even though her only previous 
credits were in Off-Off-Broadway showcases. (She also made a brief cameo in the 
film "It Could Happen to You.") With a book adapting and expanding on the play 
and a possible television production of the show to look forward to, Shear 
maintains that the best part of success is "doing something that you don't 
hate." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm probably the laziest person on Earth," she says. "But for the first time, 
coming back from Europe after a vacation, my stomach wasn't clenched. It's 
funny but everything that made me a misfit in the world made me just right to 
belong in the theater." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Blown Sideways Through Life" opens tonight at 8, continues through Nov. 27 
at the Coronet Theatre, 366 N. La Cienega Blvd. Shows are Tue.-Fri. 8 p.m.; 
Sat. 5 and 8 p.m., Sun. 3 and 7 p.m. (310) 657-7377.

MARK SINGER WINS 2 LAGUNA DESIGN AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Local architect Mark Singer and Associates won two of the four top honors -- 
for new residential and rehab residential designs -- at the fourth annual 
Laguna Beach Architectural Guild Design Awards at the Art Institute of Southern 
California Friday night. Of 52 entries, 16 received awards, including five 
merit citations and seven honorable mentions. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer's design for the new Domiano home was cited for meeting privacy 
requirements on a long, curving lot with street exposure and for its 
"excellent" use of such materials as black granite, polished concrete and maple 
wood. 
</P>
<P>
 A frequent winner in the annual Orange County American Institute of Architects 
competitions, Singer also was honored for his addition to the 30-year-old 
contractor-designed Duka residence. Judges described it as "almost a tour de 
force" in its use of the original home as a neutral backdrop for more striking 
new architectural elements. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach newcomer Horst Noppenberger of Horst Architect, who is designing 
the reconstruction of the Woods home destroyed in the fire that swept portions 
of the city a year ago, won top honors in the On the Boards (uncompleted) 
category. His design was complimented by the judges for its integration of 
curved elements and for its purity and simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Top honors for an out-of-town project (a new category this year) went to Arlen 
Stahlberg Interior Design for an intimate conference suite for the New York 
office of advertising giant Saatchi and Saatchi. The judges commented on the 
"exquisite detailing" and richness of materials in a "sophisticated and 
reserved" ambience. 
</P>
<P>
 Stahlberg, who recently moved to Laguna Beach after working in New York and 
Los Angeles, called the award "a wonderful welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 The judges were Nick DeLorenzo, president of DeLorenzo Inc., a landscape 
architecture firm in San Diego; Hsin-Ming Fung, director of design at Hodgetts 
+ Fung Design Associates in Santa Monica; and Lamont Langworthy, an architect 
and builder who is past president of the Citizens Town Planning Assn. of Laguna 
Beach. CATHY CURTIS

Q&A; BUTLER'S OUT TO REORIENT THE TAKE ON GAY, STRAIGHT ROLES; THE ACTOR TALKS 
ABOUT THE DOUBLE STANDARD IN CASTING HETEROSEXUALS AS HOMOSEXUALS, AND VICE 
VERSA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Audiences at Dan Butler's autobiographically inspired one-man play, "The Only 
Thing Worse You Could Have Told Me," which has been running at Hollywood's 
Theatre Geo since last spring , leave knowing that the veteran actor is gay. 
It's what the play is about.  
</P>
<P>
 Many more people know him, however, for his role as "straight" sportscaster 
Bob (Bulldog) Briscoe on NBC's Emmy Award-winning "Frasier." We caught up with 
Butler, 39, at a Melrose eatery to ask why he accepted such a controversial 
part.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: In deciding whether to accept this straight role, did you consider 
its possible negative consequences on your career? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: My agent privately warned me that this could be a career-terminating 
move. But after I decided to go with it, he's supported me in full. I hope that 
my public will too. And I hope I'll still be seen for gay roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So you don't think people might mistake you for Bulldog and wonder whether 
you're really straight? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'd like to think that people would not be so narrow-minded as to hold this 
against me. Besides, some of my best friends are straight! I also want to 
mention here that I continue to have a very loving and wonderful relationship 
with my boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But with women and blacks and Latinos and gays and lesbians going after 
them, why would you want to identify with such a besieged minority as straight 
white males? 
</P>
<P>
 A: As Rodney King said after the riots, we all live here together. We've got 
to get along. I don't want to pat myself up on the back, but someone's got to 
stand up for them! 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did you study for the part? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There was a time in my teens that I actually slept with women. It was just 
an awkward phase I was passing through. But I thought back to that phase, and 
played off it. I also did some research at a couple of straight bars. By the 
end of the evening, one woman gave me her number, so I think I was pretty 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We're surprised that you're admitting, for publication, that you've 
actually had some heterosexual experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Why not? I'm not big on the closet. And I'd like to add that if you're 
straight, you should be proud! That's who you are! You were born that way! 
Besides, I have a sister who's straight. And I want her to know that I love her 
and support her.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did any of your straight friends give you advice on how to play the part 
more authentically?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Sure, but I don't want to mention their names, out of respect for their 
privacy. I did, however, have two very special high school teachers. One was in 
shop class, where he taught me to use Makita power tools. The other was my 
intramural basketball teacher, who taught me hook shots.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kind of preparations did you make to play the role? Did you buy any 
special colognes or clothing? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Mostly, I watched Tommy Lasorda on TV. And I learned that the key to 
playing a straight white male is to wear pants that allow for an expanding 
waistline. I don't hold that against them, though.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the hardest jump to make in playing straight? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The way they're always talking about sex. Do you notice how often they talk 
about their wives and girlfriends? Everything they say seems to have a sexual 
innuendo. I think that being straight is a personal affair. I don't mind what 
they do behind closed doors; I just get uncomfortable when they kiss and hold 
hands so openly in public. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is your playing Bulldog a way of saying straight white men should be 
treated equal to other minorities? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Absolutely! And they're not. Sometimes -- when you watch sporting events, 
for example -- all you see are the rowdy, drunken, obnoxious straights. But 
they're only part of the crowd. The reality is that there are many other 
well-behaved straights there. That's a point I want to make in my portrayal of 
Bulldog. I want him to be the embodiment of the silent majority of straight 
white men, with a soft, Hallmark card touch to him.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does your boyfriend think of all this activism? 
</P>
<P>
 A: He's very understanding.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Hasn't he started wondering whether you might be a latent heterosexual? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I have to admit: Women are sexy. I could see how someone could get into it 
and be a happy white heterosexual. Not me, of course; but for others -- hey, 
why not?

3 NEW PRINCIPALS IN OPERA PACIFIC'S 'AIDA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As revealed in the matinee of "Aida" Sunday at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center, second casts are not always second-best. Camellia Johnson (Aida), 
Eugenie Grunewald (Amneris) and Vladimir Popov (Radames) carried the day when 
they took over at the second performance this season of Verdi's opera in a new 
production by Opera Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's sizable and luscious soprano, edgeless to a fault, apparently found 
no difficulties in the familiar yet tricky vocal part. Her "O patria mia" had 
an Italianate resonance, an even line, incipient passion and a pristine high C 
that a cynic might associate with dollars in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The soprano is short and bulky but moves with dignity; on this occasion she 
wore an unobtrusive flattering rust-colored costume. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The series of evening gowns worn by Grunewald, on the other hand, seemed an 
odd collection not exactly fitting to the Egyptian milieu. The American mezzo's 
singing, however, proved solid, sometimes potent -- especially in  
</P>
<P>
 the Judgment Scene -- despite a wiry bottom octave. Her Amneris became more 
villain than victim, the result, one supposes, of primitive stage direction -- 
or acting skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Popov, at the start of the opera clearly uncomfortable in his raised gold 
shoes, sang confidently and with considerable heart. His "Celeste Aida" was no 
model of subtlety, but proved a decent beginning; thereafter, his reliable and 
fearless vocalism gave no cause for disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 His voice is neither large nor beautiful, but it is always there. And he 
looked good. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder of the cast was reviewed after the opening night, Saturday.

CELEBRATING 'THE SHVITZ' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Sunset 5 continues its Cinema Judaica series Wednesday with a one-week run 
of Jonathan Berman's warm, infectious 50-minute "The Shvitz," a celebration of 
the fast-vanishing communal pleasure of shvitzing (sweating) and schmoozing in 
Russian-Jewish-style steam baths, and Constance Marks' rueful, wryly amusing 
25-minute "Let's Fall in Love: A Singles Weekend at the Concord" (the famous 
Catskills resort hotel).  
</P>
<P>
 Also opening Friday at the Sunset 5 for a one-week run is Martin L. Aguilar's 
"Moondance," which begins promisingly as two couples (Joris Stuyck and Patti 
Tippo, Lisa Moncure and Steve Ruggles) in their 30s spend an increasingly edgy 
weekend in a mountain cabin but takes a nose-dive into awkward fantasy.

 Menendez case -- In a Sept. 13 story about a dispute among jurors in the 
Menendez brothers murder trial, The Times reported one juror's statement that 
Judith Zamos, an alternate on the Lyle Menendez jury, had "called in and 
complained" during the trial about a television interview related to the case. 
In fact, the interview was broadcast after Zamos had ended her jury service, so 
she did not violate instructions that jurors avoid news reports on their case 
while serving on a panel.

 Pro football -- Spokesmen for the Fox television network and the NFL say that, 
contrary to a Times story in Monday's editions, there is no provision in their 
television contract requiring the NFL to receive less money from Fox if it 
fails to keep a team in the Los Angeles area. However, NFL spokesman Greg 
Aiello said, "Informally, we recognize that if Los Angeles was left without a 
team, the network would come back at us and want compensation."
