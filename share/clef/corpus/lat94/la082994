WITH COMEBACK, TIGER PUTS U.S. TITLE IN TANK; GOLF: WOODS, 18, MAKES UP 
SIX-HOLE DEFICIT AND BECOMES YOUNGEST EVER TO WIN NATIONAL AMATEUR 
CHAMPIONSHIP.

<TEXT>
<P>
 In 94 years of the U.S. Amateur Golf Championship, no player had done what 
Tiger Woods did Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, 18, became the youngest winner in the history of the tournament, and 
the Southern Californian also showed the touch and poise that may make him the 
biggest name in golf. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even Jack Nicklaus was able to win this event at 18. The Golden Bear had 
to wait until he was 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, from Cypress, won the last three holes of his 36-hole title match 
against Trip Kuehne. He surged from six down to produce what is believed to be 
the biggest comeback victory in the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tiger showed what a great player he was to keep hitting it on the greens from 
the woods and keep the pressure on," Kuehne said. "The kid showed he's got a 
lot of golf game to be able to cash in those opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, a three-time junior champion, registered a two-up victory on the 
Tournament Players Club at Sawgrass' Stadium Course. He trailed Kuehne, an 
Oklahoma State junior, by six holes after the first 13 holes, but drew to just 
four down after the morning round. In the afternoon, he rallied to win six of 
the last 10 holes and won the Havemeyer Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods took the lead for the first time by chipping in for birdie-two from 12 
feet on the treacherous 132-yard No. 17, after going left and just missing the 
water surrounding the island green on his tee shot. 
</P>
<P>
 He sealed his victory on No. 18. Kuehne, needing a long putt for a birdie, 
sent the ball six feet past the cup, and he missed coming back. Woods picked up 
his ball for a par. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods said his putting is what turned things around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew if I just hung in there, sooner of later those putts were going to go 
in," said Woods, who will enter Stanford this fall. "And they did. Coming back 
from six down means the most." 
</P>
<P>
 In becoming the youngest U.S. amateur winner, Woods usurped a quintet of 
19-year-olds led by Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods earned invitations to next year's U.S. Open, Masters and British Open. 
The U.S. Amateur is one of 13 national championship conducted annually by the 
U.S. Golf Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods finished at seven-under par for the day, while Kuehne was five-under, 
including a six-under 66 in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave it my best," said Kuehne, 22, of McKinney, Tex. "I made all of my 
birdies in the first 13 holes and only one in the last 23 holes while Tiger 
made his birdies late in the day." 
</P>
<P>
 Woods climaxed a summer in which he won three other prestigious amateur 
events, including the Western Amateur. Not bad for a player who had never 
advanced past the second round in his last two U.S. Amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an amazing feeling to come from six down, to play that kind of golf in 
the stretch," said Woods, best known for his three consecutive junior titles 
(1991-93) before his sizzling summer. "I was able to scramble and hit good 
shots and keep the pressure on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehne stood amazed at Woods' shot on No. 17, a shot that stopped two feet 
from falling over designer Pete Dye's infamous railroad ties and into the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great gamble that paid off," said Kuehne, playing in his first U.S. 
Amateur. "You don't see too many pros doing what he did." 
</P>
<P>
 What Woods did on this sun-drenched day was provide the dramatics sorely 
lacking, with the eventual champ trailing, five-down, on the front nine of the 
afternoon 18. 
</P>
<P>
 To win, Woods came out of the woods time after time. 
</P>
<P>
 After Kuehne lost holes nine through 11 in the afternoon round to watch his 
four-up advantage dwindle to one-up, Woods starting missing fairways. 
</P>
<P>
 Until his two-iron drive at the day's closing hole, he hadn't hit a fairway 
since the 529-yard 11th, which yielded the first of his three birdies on the 
final nine. 
</P>
<P>
 On the 438-yard 14th, he pushed his drive wide right, leaving the unenviable 
task of punching a 122-yard six-iron left to right onto an undulating green. 
</P>
<P>
 Having accomplished that trouble shot, he found himself in the rough left at 
the 426-yard 15th. No problem. Take an eight-iron, pop it 100 yards down the 
fairway and watch it roll onto the putting surface for a two-putt par. 
</P>
<P>
 Going into the 497-yard 16th, Woods still trailed one-down but took advantage 
of his trusty short game to give him the birdie that finally squared the match. 
</P>
<P>
 And then came the 17th. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember hitting the putt," said Woods, amid a crowd of autograph 
seekers. "All I know is that you know you have to do it and you do it. There's 
no better feeling."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What gall Georgia Frontiere has, saying she might keep the Rams in Anaheim if 
a new stadium is built. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It's not the stadium that stinks, it's the team. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I mean, has anybody ever left Anaheim Stadium on a Sunday afternoon and 
refused to come back because the view was terrible, the seats were 
uncomfortable, the neighborhood was dangerous, the traffic was unbearable, or 
the Ram fans were rowdy? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Rams used to be a hot ticket in Orange County. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It's the coldest ticket in the NFL now because the Rams have lost 45 of their 
last 64 games, show little sign of improvement, and have given every indication 
that they will move to St. Louis or Baltimore after the season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 They did make a smart trade, though, when they got Tommy Maddox from Denver 
for the bargain price of a fourth-round draft choice. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 You have to be a little suspicious because the Broncos gave up so early on the 
youngster who was supposed to be their quarterback of the future, but the Rams 
might have made up for not taking Trent Dilfer in the draft. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Maddox would have been a first-round choice this year if he had used all his 
eligibility at UCLA instead of leaving after his sophomore season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was a quick slide for Cleveland Gary, who rushed for 1,125 yards and caught 
52 passes two years ago. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, those billboards have been filled in and now read, "The Rams Are 
Moving to Fox 11.".... 
</P>
<P>
 As they demonstrated against the Houston Oilers on Saturday, even the Raider 
reserves are exciting. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 No coach was named for that all-time NFL team, but the proper choice would 
have been Vince Lombardi. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Current Green Bay Packer Coach Mike Holmgren, who just signed a three-year 
contract after putting together two winning seasons, isn't doing badly for 
someone who couldn't earn a letter at USC as a reserve quarterback. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Phil Simms of ESPN is the only TV analyst I've heard describe the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers as a sleeper. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA sports information director Marc Dellins has sent writers and 
broadcasters an oversized postcard of wide receiver J.J. Stokes posing next to 
the Heisman Trophy that was won by Bruin quarterback Gary Beban in 1967. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Early showdown of Heisman candidates: Quarterback Tommie Frazier, who starred 
in Nebraska's romp over West Virginia on Sunday, vs. Stokes on Sept. 17 at 
Lincoln, Neb. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Bruin fans who are worried about 5-foot-10, 175-pound free safety Paul 
Guidry's lack of size should be aware that Arizona safeties Brandon Sanders, 
5-10 and 175, and Tony Bouie, 5-10 and 183, are considered among the best in 
the country. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Sanders, Bouie and teammates Tedy Bruschi, Sean Harris and Jim Hoffman are 
pictured on the cover of Sports Illustrated's college football issue, which 
picks Arizona No. 1 in the nation. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tiger Woods proved to be a tiger in the woods when he kept finding the trees 
and getting out of trouble on his way to a comeback victory in the U.S. 
Amateur. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Julio Cesar Borboa, the International Boxing Federation super flyweight 
champion who faces Harold Grey tonight at the Forum, is one of the most 
improved fighters around. Borboa, who will be making the sixth defense of his 
title, was losing six-round preliminary bouts as recently as three years ago. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Unbeaten Oxnard featherweight Roberto Garcia quickened his tempo and proved to 
be a devastating finisher Saturday when he put away Frankie Avelar in the 
second round at the Grand Olympic. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The live mariachi band music is great between bouts at the Olympic, but, 
please, somebody lower the volume on the recorded rock music between rounds. 
Better yet, get rid of it. I'm sure Andre Agassi would agree. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Kent Desormeaux gave a textbook demonstration of how to steal a big race on 
the lead before his Fanmore was overtaken in deep stretch of the Arlington 
Million by favored Paradise Creek. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Pete Sampras is rusty and Steffi Graff is bothered by a bad back, so my U.S. 
Open picks are Boris Becker and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Next August's Brickyard 400 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway already is sold 
out. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I miss the Sunday baseball averages. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge Little League kids did themselves proud in Williamsport, Pa. 
Forget this runner-up stuff. They are the champions of the United States. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 College football is back. I know it is because I heard Keith Jackson call a 
game Sunday. For some of us, it doesn't get much better than that.

BOXING; BORBOA MAKES SIXTH DEFENSE OF IBF TITLE AT FORUM TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Julio Cesar Borboa, who emerged from obscurity last year to capture the 
International Boxing Federation super-flyweight championship, makes the sixth 
defense of his belt tonight at the Forum against undefeated challenger Harold 
Grey. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering his dominance of the super-flyweight division, Borboa (23-4, 21 
knockouts), whose last outing at the Forum was a blistering fourth-round 
technical knockout of Jorge Luis Roman on April 25, is eyeing a move down to 
flyweight should he defeat Grey (16-0, 15 KOs). 
</P>
<P>
 The two most prominent fighters in the lighter divisions are light-flyweights 
Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez and Michael Carbajal. Borboa is hoping to meet one 
or both at flyweight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel at 112 (the flyweight limit), moving down to fight any of the great 
fighters, Chiquita or Carbajal, shouldn't be any problem," Borboa said. "I 
think that's where the big money will be -- at 112. 
</P>
<P>
 "The opportunity to fight at 115 (the super-flyweight limit) really came as a 
surprise. I'm really a flyweight." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the card, which celebrates Forum Boxing's 12th anniversary, are two 
featherweight 10-rounders: Arnulfo (Chico) Castillo vs. Panchito Valdez; and 
Jesse Magana vs. Ericel Nucamendi.

MOTOR RACING ROUNDUP; SCHUMACHER STRIPPED OF BELGIAN VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Schumacher, the apparent runaway winner of the Belgian Grand Prix on 
Sunday, was disqualified when race stewards found that a speed-limitation 
device on his car did not meet requirements at Spa-Francorchamps, Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling gave the victory to Britain's Damon Hill, reopening the world 
championship points race only four hours after Schumacher seemed to have locked 
it up with his eighth victory in 11 races. 
</P>
<P>
 Race stewards ruled that a mandatory wooden plank under his car, aimed at 
slowing drivers, did not meet legal measurement requirements. It was too thin, 
giving him an advantage over his competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The stewards ruled out Benetton Ford's claim that it could have been caused by 
Schumacher's accidental spin during the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stewards concluded that not one of the defenses offered is acceptable," 
the ruling said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said international FIA federation spokesman Tom Walkinshaw: "Stewards of the 
Belgian Grand Prix have decided to inflict a penalty on Benetton Ford and 
driver Michael Schumacher of exclusion from the event." 
</P>
<P>
 The crude wooden board was introduced into the high-technology sport halfway 
through the season after the deaths of Brazilian Ayrton Senna and Austrian 
Roland Ratzenberger at the San Marino Grand Prix in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident is the third this year to jeopardize Schumacher's dominance, 
which once seemed vulnerable only to the guardians of Formula One racing. 
</P>
<P>
 Schumacher, driving under an appeal of a two-race suspension for disregarding 
a black flag at the British Grand Prix, will learn the fate of his appeal on 
Tuesday in Paris. A loss could cost him the points earned during the appeal, as 
well as resulting in a lengthened suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 His Benetton Ford team is under investigation for an alleged infraction in the 
refueling procedures at the German Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, instead of leading the world standings by 35 points over Hill, Schumacher 
has 76 points to Hill's 55, and more sanctions could be coming. 
</P>
<P>
 If he sits out the upcoming Italian and Portuguese Grand Prix races and Hill 
wins both, the margin could be cut to one point with three races to go. 
</P>

<P>
 Pole-sitter Scott Pruett led from start to finish in a Camaro in winning the 
Road Atlanta Blockbuster Trans-Am at Braselton, Ga., by six-tenths of a second 
over Dorsey Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kendall of Manhattan Beach finished third.

MOUNTAIN BIKES; GIOVE'S VICTORY COMPLETES SUCCESSFUL WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Missy Giove is known for rainbow hair, a nose ring and once wearing Gonzo the 
petrified piranha around her neck for luck, but when she finds her ultimate 
identity it probably will be as the best woman downhill mountain bike racer 
rather than just the far-out extreme of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Giove, 22, dominated the Jeep National Off-Road Bicycle Assn.'s national 
finals Sunday to complete the weekend's only major double victory, following 
her victory in Saturday's dual slalom. 
</P>
<P>
 John Tomac salvaged the men's downhill title although he finished third to 
Mike King of Chula Vista, who will defend his world championship at Vail, 
Colo., next month, and Brian Lopes of Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomac, first off the hill, posted a time of 3:43.92 -- about 45 m.p.h. on a 
hill rated about 10 m.p.h. slower than Mammoth Lakes' Kamikaze run -- but King 
lowered that with a 3:43.27. Lopes then finished in 3:43.84 for second place. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're always concerned about (Tomac), he's such a phenomenal athlete," King 
said. "But to be honest, I wasn't really worried about him because his seeding 
time didn't look all that great." 
</P>
<P>
 King won the season's first event in Georgia but fell out of overall 
contention when he broke his collarbone in Vermont and sat out three events. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of Giove's victories got her a national title, either. Those went to 
Cheri Elliott of California Heights, Calif., in dual slalom and to Kim Sonier 
of Flagstaff, Ariz., who finished second to Giove. Sonier, 31, had won three of 
the previous downhill races on the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone thinks we're like arch-enemies," Sonier said. "She's one of the best 
friends I have on the circuit. I need to have her guts and she needs to have my 
consistency. So we learn from each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Sonier, starting two places behind Giove in her run, was halfway down the 
2.3-mile, 1,200-foot drop Snow Summit course when Giove blazed through the 
finish in 3:57.24 -- 4 1/2 seconds faster than anybody else to that point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could hear the loudspeakers, but I was trying really hard not to listen," 
Sonier said. "I got nervous as soon as they said 'Go,' like I forgot how to 
ride my bike. I made a lot of little mistakes all the way down." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Sonier posted the second fastest time -- 4:00.67 -- but there 
was no touching Giove. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went all out on the top and rode the whole way down," Giove said. "I scared 
myself a lot."

NEBRASKA ROUTS WEST VIRGINIA, 31-0; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: QUARTERBACK FRAZIER RUNS 
FOR THREE TOUCHDOWNS AS CORNHUSKERS EASILY WIN KICKOFF CLASSIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nebraska, which ended last season with a heartbreaking loss in the Orange 
Bowl, started this season with an impressive victory in the Kickoff Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommie Frazier ran for three touchdowns and passed for another as the 
fourth-ranked Cornhuskers routed No. 24 West Virginia, 31-0, on Sunday in the 
opening game of college football's 125th season. 
</P>
<P>
 "All summer, as we went through conditioning, we felt we had something to 
prove to the world," Nebraska linebacker Danta Jones said. "Today was the day 
to shine." 
</P>
<P>
 And nobody played better than Frazier, who rushed for 130 yards in 12 carries 
and completed eight of 16 passes for 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you could say I was in the right place at the right time," he said. 
"My blockers gave me great blocks." 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams went 11-0 last season before losing bowl games. Nebraska missed a 
last-second field goal and fell to Florida State, 18-16, in a national title 
showdown in the Orange Bowl. West Virginia was clobbered by Florida, 41-7, in 
the Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The way the Cornhuskers played in the sweltering 90-degree heat Sunday at 
Giants Stadium, they appear capable of reaching another championship game this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 West Virginia didn't cross midfield until it recovered a fumble early in the 
fourth quarter and was shut out for the first time since a 19-0 loss to Penn 
State in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had the ball so much, our defense just got worn out," said Mountaineer 
Coach Don Nehlen. "You can't let a team run 48 plays in the first half in this 
heat and humidity." 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska gained 285 yards and 17 first downs in the first half while holding 
West Virginia to four yards and two first downs. For the game, the Cornhuskers 
outgained the Mountaineers 468-89, including 368-8 on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska sophomore Lawrence Phillips filled the gap left by the departure of 
star tailback Calvin Jones, rushing for 126 yards in 24 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier, a junior who has directed Nebraska's option attack since midway 
through his freshman season, helped the Cornhuskers take command in the second 
quarter after going ahead, 3-0, on Tom Sieler's 32-yard field goal in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier scored on runs of 25 and 27 yards and completed a 12-yard touchdown 
pass play to Reggie Baul to give Nebraska a 24-0 halftime lead. He added a 
42-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud of Tommie," Coach Tom Osborne said. "He made some great plays, and 
some not so good. But obviously the big advantage we had coming into this game 
was at quarterback. He had the experience. He has been there before." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomores Chad Johnston and Eric Boykin alternated at quarterback for West 
Virginia, but neither could move the team and they were sacked a total of eight 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston was sacked three times and had one pass intercepted in his first 
college start. 
</P>
<P>
 West Virginia's Robert Walker, who gained a school-record 1,250 yards last 
season, was held to 46 yards in 12 carries by Nebraska's quick, aggressive 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The only bright spot for the Mountaineers was All-Big East punter Todd 
Sauerbrun, who averaged 60 yards on nine kicks, including a school-record 
90-yarder in the first quarter.

 Miami Dolphins linebacker John Offerdahl has retired after eight 
injury-plagued seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Offerdahl, a five-time Pro Bowl selection who spent his entire pro career with 
the Dolphins, was placed on the reserve-retired list Sunday when teams trimmed 
rosters to the mandatory 53-player limit. 
</P>
<P>
 He appeared in a single exhibition game Friday, when the Dolphins lost to the 
Vikings, 31-16, and became concerned about his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never wanted to be the type of player who is sometimes viewed as a player 
who should've got out of the game earlier," he said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a moment on the field when I realized that this decision was going 
to be made. When it came to me, to be honest, I felt sad and at peace. I knew 
it was my time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins also waived seven-year offensive tackle Mark Dennis and running 
back Aaron Craver. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ten-year veteran Eric Martin was cut by the New Orleans Saints. Martin, the 
Saints' all-time leading receiver, was one of six cuts by the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, the Saints' seventh-round pick in 1985, topped the team's list for 
receptions (532), receiving yards (7,854) and receiving touchdowns (48). He had 
caught at least one pass in 105 consecutive games, tying him for the 
seventh-longest streak in NFL history and the third longest current streak.

 Australian-born punter Darren Bennett was among seven players dropped by the 
San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 Before this season, Bennett had never punted in the United States. The former 
Australian Rules Football League long-ball kicking champion earned a tryout 
with the Chargers after making a positive impression at the team's mini-camp in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett was the front-runner for the punting spot until John Kidd, San Diego's 
punter from 1990-93, was signed as a free agent two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In five preseason games, Bennett averaged 42.5 yards on 13 punts. 
</P>

 The Philadelphia Eagles released former UCLA defensive lineman Bruce Walker, 
the 37th player taken in this year's draft. Walker didn't play college football 
last season after being charged with receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Rich Kotite proclaimed Walker "a very big disappointment," adding that 
he didn't make the commitment needed to play in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 A highly recruited player after a stellar high school career at Dominguez High 
in Compton, Walker was an outside linebacker as a freshman at UCLA before 
switching to nose tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 After getting 122 tackles and three sacks in his first three seasons with the 
Bruins, he was suspended from the team before the start of his senior season 
after police found stolen property in an apartment he shared with two other 
men. Walker, who pleaded no contest to the charge and was sentenced to 
community service, said the property belonged to one of his roommates and he 
was not aware it was stolen.

 The Houston Oilers promoted Bucky Richardson to second string quarterback 
ahead of Sean Salisbury, who will be asked to take a salary cut. Salisbury, a 
free agent, signed a one-year deal with a base salary of $700,000 and a signing 
bonus of $400,000. Richardson has a two-year deal worth $500,000 per season. 
Cody Carlson is the starter.

Heath Shuler or veteran John Friesz will start the season opener Sept. 4 
against Seattle. . . . The Indianapolis Colts decided to keep Don Majkowski and

 Throughout training camp, Coach Art Shell has stuck with Tyrone Montgomery and 
Napoleon McCallum as his starting backfield and told reporters that they can do 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell's stance appeared shaky for the first four exhibition games as 
Montgomery and McCallum struggled with a limited amount of carries. That 
changed Saturday, however, when the two combined for 71 yards in 16 carries in 
the Raiders' 24-23 victory over Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery led the way with his most impressive effort as a running back after 
moving from wide receiver, gaining 53 yards in 10 carries. McCallum, who made 
several key blocks, gained 18 yards in six carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Williams also had a strong game with 27 yards in four carries as the 
Raiders dominated the line of scrimmage in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought our running game was excellent in the first half," Shell said. "In 
the second half, we had the same problem that has plagued us throughout the 
preseason in that we didn't finish some plays or else we would have had backs 
jumping into the secondary like we had in the first half." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After Charles Jordan caught the touchdown pass from Billy Joe Hobert with 38 
seconds remaining to cut the Oilers' lead to 23-22, Shell quickly decided to go 
for the two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to win the game," Shell said. "We could have kicked the extra-point 
to go into overtime but I wasn't about to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 So, did Shell think about being compared to Denver Coach Wade Phillips when he 
decided to tie the game after the Broncos scored a last-second touchdown 
against the Raiders in their game last month? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I didn't say that," Shell laughed. 
</P>
<P>

 Defensive backs Derrick Hoskins and James Trapp suffered minor knee injuries 
against Houston but are expected to practice this week. Cornerback Lionel 
Washington (hamstring), defensive tackle Chester McGlockton (leg) and offensive 
tackle Bruce Wilkerson (foot) are expected to play in the opener Monday night 
against the 49ers. . . . The Raiders have won the last two regular-season 
meetings against San Francisco, but did not score a touchdown in either game. 
The Raiders won, 9-3, in 1988 and, 12-6, in 1991. LONNIE WHITE

 The Rams were awaiting the arrival of former Charger tight end Derrick Walker 
on Sunday night for a tryout. Unless Walker is impressive, the team is expected 
to sign former Washington tight end Ron Middleton today. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams sign Middleton, tight end Travis McNeal, who received permission 
Sunday to leave the team to attend to an illness in his family, is likely to be 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 Middleton (6-2, 262) worked primarily as a blocking tight end with Washington, 
and will fill the void left by Pat Carter's defection during the offseason to 
Houston.

 Tight end Rickey Brady, wide receiver Jermaine Ross, offensive tackle Ron 
Edwards and defensive lineman Kevin Patrick are expected to be signed this week

DEL MAR; PASEANA WINS THE CHULA VISTA OVER EXCHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sunday's $200,000 Chula Vista Handicap looked like the closest thing to a 
match race at Del Mar in a week. When Glass Ceiling was scratched Sunday 
morning, only Magical Maiden and Golden Klair were left to challenge the entry 
of Paseana and Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was show betting off, but now place betting was off as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Sidney Craig was not pleased that his mares were running head to head, 
but their trainers -- Ron McAnally for Paseana and Bill Spawr for Exchange -- 
wanted the race and Craig had to live with it. His dream, to be sure, would be 
a deadheat. 
</P>
<P>
 He almost got his wish. 
</P>
<P>
 After 1 1/16th mile, Paseana's nose hit the finish line a nose ahead of 
Exchange, giving the Craig entry a one-two finish that surprised no one. The 
win payoff was $2.60. 
</P>
<P>
 Paseana was ridden by Chris McCarron and Exchange carried Laffit Pincay Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris tried to catch her at exactly the right time," Craig said. "It was so 
close I wasn't sure Exchange hadn't won." 
</P>
<P>
 The third and fourth finishers, Magical Maiden and Golden Klair, were both 
within a length of Paseana at the wire. Paseana was timed in 1:40 2/5, 
two-fifths of a second off the track record. 
</P>
<P>
 Magical Maiden, the defending champion, set the pace under Corey Nakatani. 
However, Exchange and Paseana started closing on the backstretch. Golden Klair, 
ridden by Corey Black, was four lengths back, but starting her move as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming into the stretch, Magical Maiden led by a nose with Exchange on her 
outside and Black guiding Golden Klair toward an opening on the rail. Paseana 
was right behind Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to stay the heck away from Exchange," McCarron said. "(Exchange) 
gets where she thinks she's ahead and she kind of idles. I wanted to try to 
catch her when she was decelerating and blow by her." 
</P>
<P>
 Pincay knew what McCarron had in mind. McCarron put Paseana where Exchange 
could not see her, but he couldn't fool Pincay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Laffit and I were playing mind games," McCarron laughed. "He knew what I 
wanted to do and he wouldn't let it happen. It was basically a match race from 
the eighth pole." 
</P>
<P>
 When will Paseana and Exchange meet again? 
</P>
<P>
 "Never," Craig said. "Well, never say never, but I'm not that young. My heart 
can't take this." Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Embroidered, ridden by David Flores, won the $55,000 Generous Portion Stakes 
for 2-year-old fillies over six furlongs. Embroidered, owned by Katherine 
Griffiths and trained by Riley Griffiths, rallied in the stretch to beat Regal 
Ruthie and Spafica. . . . Trainer Charlie Whittingham's Flawlessly, second to 
Hatoof in the Beverly D at Arlington International on Saturday, will not make 
her next start until the Breeders' Cup, but it might not be at Churchill Downs. 
She will go either in the Breeders' Cup or the Yellow Ribbon at Oak Tree a day 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of questions about the Del Mar Derby, scheduled for a week from today, 
will be answered when invitations are extended today. The most significant is 
whether the field will be split into divisions for the third time in its 
history, the first since 1970. . . . Trainer Jenine Sahadi's Grand Flotilla, 
winner of the Sunset Handicap at Hollywood Park, will make his first start 
since then next Sunday in the Del Mar Handicap. . . . Trainer Rodney Rash went 
zero for four with the horses he sent to Arlington for weekend races. 
</P>
<P>
 Wild Escapade, making his first stakes start after losing his previous race by 
20 1/2 lengths, defeated previously unbeaten Montreal Red by five lengths in 
the Hopeful Stakes for 2-year-olds at Saratoga. Wild Escapade, ridden by Jorge 
Chavez, stalked pacesetting Boone's Mill until the last eighth of a mile, then 
took command and won in 1:23 1/5 for the seven furlongs. He paid $66, $9.80 and 
$2.60. Law Of The Sea finished third, another three-quarters of length back. 
Completing the order of finish were Bick, Boone's Mill and Flitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal Red, the 3-5 favorite ridden by Jose Santos, paid $2.60 and $2.10. 
Law Of The Sea, ridden by Julie Krone, returned $2.40. Boone's Mill, winner of 
the Sapling at Monmouth Park in his last start, shot out of the gate from the 
No. 3 post, and was followed by Wild Escapade, who started from the No. 2 post. 
Boone's Mill was never able to shake Wild Escapade, although he had a clear 
lead at the top of the stretch. Wild Escapade passed the tiring leader at 
midstreatch. Montreal Red was fifth, six lengths back with three-eighths of 
mile left. While he improved his position, he was able to cut only one length 
off his deficit. Montreal Red was trying for his fourth victory and also trying 
to become the fourth horse to sweep Saratoga's stakes triple for 2-year-olds, 
the Sanford, Saratoga Special and Hopeful. His trainer, Sandy Schulhofer, won 
the Whitney Handicap on Saturday with Colonial Affair and will try to win the 
Spinaway for 2-year-old fillies today with Stormy Blues, unbeaten in two 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Lawrence resigned as executive vice president of the New York Racing 
Assn., citing differences with other NYRA leaders. As executive vice president, 
Lawrence oversaw the daily operation of the NYRA's three tracks: Aqueduct, 
Belmont Park and Saratoga. Lawrence, 55, a native of Pittsburgh, joined the 
NYRA Jan. 1, 1991, from Churchill Downs, where he had served as executive vice 
president and chief operating officer since October of 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Thunder Rumble, the beaten favorite in the Whitney Handicap at Saratoga, was 
injured during the race. Trainer Richie O'Connell said that the 5-year-old 
horse suffered an injury to the check ligament, located slightly below and 
behind the knee, in his left foreleg. He said it hadn't been determined if 
Thunder Rumble would return to racing or be sent to stud.

Stevens, paid $12.40, $6.60 and $5.40 and tied the stakes record of 2:01 for 1 
1/4 miles on turf set by Ghazi in 1992. The track record of 1:58 4/5 was set by

 Question: I understand there is a law requiring employers to reclassify 
part-time employees who work more then 1,000 hours a year. Is this correct? 
Will part-time workers be made full time or just be given similar benefits? 
</P>
<P>
 -- J.C., Rancho Santa Margarita 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: You are referring to a requirement in the federal Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act that says an employer must normally credit any employee who 
works at least 1,000 hours with a year toward eligibility for pension benefits. 
The law does not require any changes in an employee's status.

 Question: When sick time is accrued during the year, is it legal for the 
company to take back unused time at the end of the year? 
</P>
<P>
 -- D.Y., Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Sick time and sick time pay is a matter of contract between an 
employer and employee. Accordingly, there are many possible provisions that are 
perfectly permissible. 
</P>
<P>
 If an employer has a traditional sick leave pay policy in which sick pay is 
contingent on sickness only, many plans stipulate that the unused sick leave 
balance at year's end is lost and a worker begins a new accrual rate for the 
following year. 
</P>
<P>
 There are indeed certain situations, however, when an employer has a plan that 
grants a certain number of "paid days off," which can be used for any purpose, 
including sick leave and/or vacation and cannot be "lost" at the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there are also both state and federal regulations regarding docking 
the salary of an "exempt" employee. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are an hourly employee and fall within a traditional sick leave policy, 
the practice of the company to take back unused time at the end of the year is 
permitted.

SAGANSKY EXPECTED TO BE NAMED HEAD OF SONY SOFTWARE; ENTERTAINMENT: EX-CBS 
EXECUTIVE IS SAID TO BE IN FINAL NEGOTIATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeffrey Sagansky, the former chief programmer at CBS who guided the network 
from third to first place in the ratings, is expected to be named president of 
Sony Software, the holding company of Sony Pictures, Sony Music and the 
company's growing multimedia operations, knowledgeable sources said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagansky, who left CBS earlier this summer, will report to current Sony 
Software President Michael P. Schulhof, who is expected to be promoted to 
chairman of Sony Software, the sources added. Sagansky will be based in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagansky is said to be in final negotiations and an announcement is expected 
be made later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Since leaving CBS when his contract expired, Sagansky has been weighing 
various offers, including becoming a partner in Savoy Pictures, the independent 
film production and distribution company. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an unusual arrangement, Sony Pictures Chairman Peter Guber will 
continue to report directly to Schulhof. That may be only a temporary 
arrangement, however, because many people in the industry expect Guber, who has 
headed Sony Pictures for nearly five years, to return to producing as early as 
next year. The appointment of Sagansky will put an executive who has experience 
in both television and the movie industry at the helm of one of the largest 
entertainment companies in the country. Before he joined CBS in 1989, Sagansky 
was president of TriStar pictures, a Sony subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagansky, who is out of town, could not be reached for comment. Sony officials 
also could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly how Sagansky and Schulhof will delineate responsibilities is not 
clear. Sony has often been criticized for being top heavy with senior managers 
and Sagansky's appointment could signal that other changes are in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sony Music, whose artists include Pearl Jam, Bruce Springsteen and 
Mariah Carey, has been achieving record results, the film division has lagged 
behind the other big Hollywood studios. Movie revenue dropped 7% to $3.2 
billion for the fiscal year ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 On the television side, the studio has also been without a big hit in recent 
years, with the exception of the NBC comedy "Mad About You." The television 
division is also more than a year behind schedule in launching a new cable TV 
game show channel. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been speculation in recent weeks that Sony was wooing Disney studio 
Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, who lost a bid to play a large role at the 
entertainment company. But last week, Sony denied that it was in negotiations 
with Katzenberg.

ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Emmons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 DEMAND & SUPPLY: In 1990, 687,000 cars parked at John Wayne Airport. Three 
years later, the number increased to 1.85 million, many forced across the 
freeway to overflow lots. . . . The crush is likely to get worse before it gets 
better. Two years of construction for new airport parking is due to start in 
fall of 1995 and will shut down many existing spaces. . . . Once done, the 
airport will have built nearly all the 8,400 spaces allowed by court-imposed 
restrictions. "People don't realize we have a limit on our facilities as well 
as our flights," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 JWX? John Wayne is an international airport of sorts, and signs may soon be 
going up reflecting that. . . . Travelers now can book overseas flights on KLM 
Royal Dutch Airlines and British Airways that "originate" in Orange County. But 
though they check their bags with KLM tags or show a British Airways ticket, 
they board a USAir or Northwest Airlines plane to connect to the overseas 
flight elsewhere. . . . The carriers want KLM and British Airways signs 
installed inside and outside the terminal. Authorities are considering the 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 EDDIE WHO? When the airport's old, empty Eddie Martin Terminal finally is 
demolished in October, will anything remain to commemorate the airport's 
founder? . . . The airport is named after an actor and the new terminal after a 
county supervisor. What's left for Martin (above, circa 1924) is a display of 
his memorabilia planned for the lobby of a private-plane terminal to be built 
by Martin Aviation, the firm Martin founded. . . . Why not name the private 
terminal after Eddie? "It might create confusion with the old building in 
people's minds," a spokesman says. 
</P>
<P>
 SUCKER BET: What's the largest airplane ever to take off and land at John 
Wayne Airport? If you weren't on the apron Aug. 14, you probably won't know. . 
. . The answer: one of Federal Express' huge, double-deck Airbus A310 cargo 
planes. Half the length of a football field, 79 tons unloaded, the plane landed 
and took off three times to test noise for the county's study of potential 
cargo service. . . . So far the county has not released results, but a local 
pilot who witnessed the takeoffs said the plane was "incredibly quiet."

 SWEET ACRES: The corn is being given away, but there are some catches: You've 
got to pick it yourself and you've got to pick out the worms. . . . Green Foods 
Corp. is giving away 21,000 ears of sweet corn to Ventura County churches and 
charities. The crop was grown as a test of corn's ability to enrich the soil. 
And as with other Green Foods products, no pesticides or fertilizers were used. 
. . . "You'll find worms in our corn," Green Foods spokesman Stephen Hartmann 
said. "But that doesn't seem to be stopping anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 SWEAT EQUITY: Count among those racing to the harvest 17-year-old Vernadette 
Lacbain. She and other members of the Mary Star Of The Sea Youth Leadership 
group soon will comb the Oxnard field, picking as many ears as they can. . . . 
They plan to sell the corn as part of an ongoing effort to raise money for a 
trip to the Philippines to see Pope John Paul. . . . "I thought maybe we could 
use this corn to help us," said Lacbain, an incoming junior at Channel Islands 
High. "I hope we can pick a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 RED ALERT: Whatever happened to the Red Team? If you'll recall, it was a group 
formed last spring by the Ventura County Economic Development Assn. that tried 
but failed to lure Mercedes-Benz to the county. . . . "The Red Team is there at 
ready alert," said Carolyn Leavens, VCEDA's new president (B1). . . . Leavens 
said the Red Team currently is courting Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, a New 
York engineering school looking to branch out West. 
</P>
<P>
 GREEN WITH ENVY: The residents around Westlake Lake must view Lake Sherwood 
with at least a twinge of jealously. Lake Sherwood is well on its way to 
solving its algae problem; Westlake Village has got it bad (B4).. . . Until 
recently, dead layers of the brownish-green plant grew with abandon on Lake 
Sherwood. . . . "Two years ago it was pretty bad," said Paul Culver, president 
of the Lake Sherwood Community Assn. "But they got after it and it has greatly 
improved."

 Foothill looked like anything but a champion after dropping its first three 
games. Then quarterback Kevin Daft found the mark. Daft averaged barely 100 
yards per game passing in nonleague play, but finished the regular season with 
1,211 yards and nine touchdowns. The Knights stomped through league play and 
reached the quarterfinals of the Southern Section Division IV playoffs. They 
lost to eventual champion Irvine, 27-24. Villa Park finished second, but had 
the league's most exciting player in Grant Pearsall, who is now at USC. He 
gained 1,551 yards rushing and scored 23 touchdowns, five on kick returns. The 
Spartans advanced to the quarterfinals before losing to Sherman Oaks Notre 
Dame, 33-6. Canyon, which had not been to the playoffs since 1986, started the 
season 6-0-1. The Comanches then hit the skids. They were tied by El Modena, 
then lost to Villa Park and Foothill. Still, they reached the playoffs and 
threw a scare into No. 1-seeded Moreno Valley Canyon Springs, losing 27-21.

 Canyon backed into the playoffs, going 0-2-1 in its last three league games. 
But the Comanches got in for the first time since 1986. Getting back is going 
to take some doing. The Comanches have experience and some talent at skill 
positions, but the offensive line needs to be rebuilt. Petronis, a second-team 
all-league pick, is the only returning starter. Hoover, a first-team all-league 
pick, is back at quarterback to guide the run-and-shoot offense, which was 
erratic last season. Still, Hoover passed for more than 1,700 yards and 11 
touchdowns last season. Jacobs, a two-time all-league selection, caught 40 
passes last season. The offense will have to put some points up because the 
defense has huge holes to fill. Petronis is the only returning starter there.

 Not many teams can boast a living legend as a coach. Hill brings with him a 
196-87-3 varsity record and a world of experience. He'll need it. The Panthers 
are not without talent. Ford is as good as there is up front in league. Bell is 
fast. Garza and Heard should be able to carry the load at running back. Then 
there's the quarterback spot. Lauridsen is the only one with experience but was 
erratic last season. But either he or the untested McGraw will be at 
quarterback. Lurking in the background is Starr. SCHEDULE

 The Falcons again will try to reach the playoffs for the first time since 
1979. They finished with a .500 record last season for the first time since 
1981, but finished a half game behind Canyon for the last playoff spot. The 
Falcons can get there this season if they get Cherrington some help. He gained 
1,234 yards against defenses geared to stop him. Cherrington rushed for 327 
yards and four touchdowns against Dana Hills. But the Falcons' passing game 
didn't complement him. That will have to change for Valley to advance. That's 
where Trujillo comes in. Elsewhere, the Falcons have size and speed. So a 
little offensive balance can take them a long way. SCHEDULE

<P>
 The class of the league, even with the loss of Grant Pearsall (USC), who 
played four positions last season. Although the Spartans might not have the 
marquee name, they do have everything else. McMahon is a solid quarterback and 
Villa Park has several quality receivers, led by Adams. That should give the 
running game time to develop. The offensive line is huge and experienced. The 
defense the same. Watch out for Lenard Barnes, who was devastating at times, 
even if he was undisciplined. He could be the best defensive lineman in the 
league. SCHEDULE

 After a wobbly first season, Howard has better days ahead. The Vanguards'

are some questions. Who will play quarterback is anyone's guess at the moment. 
Goodwin, Seltzer and Vasquez all have a shot. But the offensive line is big and 
the defense should be tight. Bandel is being looked at by some Division I

<P>
 A lot of lettermen, 31 in all, but is there enough talent? Robinson is a known 
quality. He gained 158 yards against Chino in the first round of the Southern 
Section Division IV playoffs. Tuioti is another bright spot. He was a 
first-team all-league selection. Then it gets a little hazy. Meiss must replace 
four offensive linemen and find a new quarterback. So defenses are certain to 
concentrate on Robinson, who is an explosive runner. The defense has a little 
more to offer, including Sveslosky, Bowman and Mason. But the Knights clearly 
have the depth to retool. SCHEDULE

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; A LIFE WARPED BY THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SCARS OF CHILDHOOD; 
DINA'S BOOK BY HARRIET WASSMO , TRANSLATED FROM NORWEGIAN BY NADIA M. 
CHRISTENSEN ,ARCADE PUBLISHING, $22.95, 448 PAGES

<P>
 At first glance, it's hard to tell if "Dina's Book" by the Norwegian author 
Harriet Wassmo is brilliant or bad. What is one to make of the short paragraphs 
and simple declarative statements that sometimes sound like a child speaking? 
And the opening scene in which a woman pushes a sleigh containing her sick 
husband from a snow-covered cliff into the raging torrent below -- isn't this a 
shade too much like a bad suspense film? 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as one reads on, encouraged by the knowledge that Wassmo was the winner 
of the 1987 Nordic Council Literature Prize (like our Pulitzer Prize), one 
begins to see the signs of an accomplished writer -- in the detailed 
description of what one must do to kill a man, in his startled look before he 
goes over the edge, in the picture of a tall woman in a man's leather trousers 
who rubs debris into a knife wound on her arm to make it look as if she fell 
from the sleigh. It soon becomes clear that "Dina's Book" is, if not brilliant, 
at least remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in mid-19th-Century rural Norway, Dina's is the powerful story of a life 
warped by the psychological scars of childhood trauma. Although her mental 
illness distorts her vision and prevents her from living the fullest possible 
life, Dina is strong, talented and independent -- akin to other tough-minded 
women of 19th-Century fiction, such as the philanthropic Dorothea in George 
Eliot's "Middlemarch" or Edna Pontellier, who exchanges a boring marriage for 
sexual freedom and the life of an artist in Kate Chopin's American classic, 
"The Awakening." 
</P>
<P>
 The central event of "Dina's Book" occurs when Dina, at the age of 5, curious 
to understand the workings of a new machine in the family wash house, pulls a 
lever that tips a bucket of boiling lye over Hjertrud, her mother. Hjertrud 
dies horribly. 
</P>
<P>
 Dina's guilt is exacerbated by her father's refusal to see her. She grows up 
like a "wild bird" running barefoot around her father's estate -- he's the 
sheriff -- grabbing food where she can find it and sleeping in the stables with 
the horses. For five years she is mute. 
</P>
<P>
 Her life changes and her speech returns when a pastor shames her father into 
hiring a tutor who plays the cello. When she first hears him play, tears pour 
down her cheeks. "Play more!" she cries. Young Dina becomes an accomplished 
musician, and she discovers her gift for mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years later, the sheriff marries her off to Jacob Gronelv, an old friend 
and neighbor more than twice Dina's age. Yet 16-year-old Dina is more than a 
match for Jacob, who is basically a kindly man; Dina is an impulsive, willful 
creature, afraid of nothing and as sexually uninhibited as a young animal once 
Jacob introduces her to such pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
 Dina wears him out with her sexual demands, her midnight cello-playing and her 
tomboyish behavior, and he starts an affair with a widow his own age. When 
Jacob's leg becomes gangrenous after a fall on the ice while visiting the 
widow, Dina kills him. 
</P>
<P>
 It's clear that Dina murders out of a God-given sense of rightness, partly as 
if she were putting a sick animal out of its misery, but also because she 
believes any wrongdoing may be punishable by death.  
</P>
<P>
 It is the first sign that something is seriously wrong with Dina, that her 
mother's death warped her more deeply than anyone suggested. The apparent 
contradiction between mental sickness and Dina's development as a fine, strong 
young woman is the tension at the heart of the book. 
</P>
<P>
 After Jacob's death, Dina takes on an important role in the community. With 
her talent for figures, she runs his estate like the savviest modern 
businesswoman. Breaking societal rules about a woman's place, drinking, smoking 
cigars and wearing men's clothes, she nevertheless becomes accepted as an equal 
by men and she is admired by all for her principles and plain-spokenness. She 
also falls passionately in love. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that Dina retains the exacting, internal logic she learned at 
the age of 5, watching her mother die -- that people cannot be forgiven. And 
she is haunted, literally, by the ghosts of Hjertrud and Jacob. 
</P>
<P>
 Dina's brief first-person comments are dotted throughout the third-person 
narrative, usually beginning "I am Dina," as if she needs to affirm her 
existence again and again in the face of Hjertrud's overpowering ghostly 
presence. In this context, the novel's strange, jerky style makes perfect 
sense. For this is the precise, concrete, simple language of Dina, the eternal 
child, trying to explain the world to herself. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatness of this book is its gut-wrenching portrait of a woman forever in 
the grip of her past, who learns only selfishness from her father, finds solace 
only in sex, certainty only in numbers, and who seems doomed to relive and 
repeat the events of her childhood for the rest of her days.

 It's unlikely Gerald R. Ford will ever finish at the top of a list of great 
Presidents, but he has finished first in one survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Autograph Collector magazine, based in Corona, in its September issue ranks 
Ford at the top of a list of "worst signers." 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine based its ranking by talking to autograph collectors, who 
reported to the magazine that Ford doesn't exactly welcome them. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine says it was "astonished" by the reports because Ford "is so 
accommodating through the mail." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, fellow Republican President Ronald Reagan is on the list of "best 
signers," at No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would sign all day if the Secret Service didn't, on more than one 
occasion, drag him away," the magazine says. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, others appearing on the "worst list" include child actor 
Macaulay Culkin, basketball-baseball player Michael Jordan, singer Madonna, 
former talk show host Arsenio Hall, actress Julia Roberts and former Laker star 
Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 The best list also includes actors Danny DeVito, Tom Selleck, Jack Nicholson

SOME RELOCATED GM WORKERS FEELING DUPED; LABOR: THEY MOVED TO MIDWEST TO WORK 
AT PLANT THAT'S BEEN SOLD. UNION, COMPANY SAY PACT WILL ADDRESS CONCERNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Duane Kennedy never wanted to leave Southern California, but after the 
shutdown of the Van Nuys General Motors plant eliminated his cherished factory 
job, he relented. Early last summer, he accepted a company transfer to a plant 
in Anderson, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's family ties to the Los Angeles area were strong, yet finding a way 
to stay with GM came first. The story was much the same for many of the other 
80 or so former Van Nuys workers who also relocated to the central Indiana 
community, drawn by the attractive pay, benefits and ostensible security of a 
GM job. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, some of these workers worry that they were duped. The reason: GM sold 
some of its Anderson operations earlier this month to a new venture. In all, 
about 40 of the Van Nuys veterans -- along with 2,200 other workers, including 
many other transferees -- no longer work for the giant auto maker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ended up being sold off to a company that I had no desire to work for," 
said Kennedy, 35, whose father and father-in-law preceded him at the Van Nuys 
GM plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The tale of these former Van Nuys workers is hardly a disaster to rival what 
has happened to so many other families in recession-ravaged Southern 
California. "These folks continue to be gainfully employed," said Charles 
Licari, a GM spokesman in Detroit. "They're not suddenly without jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the situation is another poignant irony involving a 
long-troubled plant that continues to generate controversy two years after it 
was closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Van Nuys veterans now in Indiana were the most eager workers who, 
instead of drawing generous GM jobless benefits, seized one of the first 
opportunities they could to land a new job with the company. Others sensed -- 
incorrectly, as it turned out -- that the union would fail to win generous 
extended jobless benefits from GM. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever their motivation, the Van Nuys veterans who jumped at the chance to 
return to work received skimpy relocation packages normally in the range of 
$1,000 to $3,000. Plus, they now have the jitters about being sold off by GM. 
Although their new employer has promised to match the workers' pay and benefits 
under the current union contract, many employees worry about what will happen 
when the agreement expires in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 While other workers whose plants are taken over in corporate acquisitions 
often face harsher fates, the changeover in Anderson is upsetting for many 
blue-collar workers who said goodby to the familiar comforts of their hometowns 
to stay with GM. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the former Van Nuys workers who put off taking new jobs as long as 
possible in favor of continuing to receive GM jobless benefits checks of $740 a 
week or more are being rewarded for waiting things out. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring GM started offering relocation packages worth up to $60,000, 
including $25,000 signing bonuses, to former Van Nuys workers still on layoff. 
In addition, the workers are returning to work at bona fide GM plants and, in 
some cases, are landing sought-after lighter-duty jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 GM launched the lucrative relocation offer because it is tired of paying 
jobless benefits to laid-off employees at a time when it needs workers in other 
parts of the country. Still, it was galling to workers such as Kennedy, who 
said he received a relocation package of only $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why didn't they offer us that?" Kennedy said of the $60,000 packages. "We 
were the ones who wanted to go to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy and other former Van Nuys workers say they feel betrayed by both the 
company and their union. These workers contend they should have been warned of 
the potential for the Anderson divestiture back when they had the option of 
transferring elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kennedy, the sense of hardship is deepened by the fact that his wife, 
Lisa, and the couple's three children have stayed behind in the family's house 
in Palmdale while the family sorts out the work situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason my husband moved 2,200 miles was to stay with General 
Motors," and to keep the company's retirement and medical benefits, said Lisa 
Kennedy, during a recent family visit to Indiana. "You can't find those kinds 
of benefits anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Also upset are older Van Nuys veterans who were close to accumulating the 30 
years they needed at GM to collect full pensions. Despite union and company 
assurances, some of these long-term employees fear their pension payouts will 
be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked for GM all these years, and we feel like we've been cast aside," 
said Frank Macomber, an Anderson worker who put in 25 years with GM. 
</P>
<P>
 But meanwhile, union and company officials are working on a pact that they say 
addresses those concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 They are negotiating final details of a "memorandum of understanding" for 
employees at the Anderson plants, along with a Meridian, Miss., facility, that 
GM sold to the new, Citicorp-led venture called Delco Remy America. Among other 
things, the pact will deal with pensions and the potential rights of some 
employees to transfer from Delco Remy back to GM facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Licari, the GM spokesman, noted that transfers have been arranged for 
high-seniority workers in previous instances when the company divested plants. 
"I'm sure that something will be worked out down there" in Anderson, too, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Delco Remy officials emphasize that they will honor the the current contract 
running until 1996. "We're trying to make this a seamless transition," said 
Thomas J. Snyder, president and chief operating officer of the new firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble is, the workers who aren't able to transfer from Delco Remy fear that 
their pay and benefits will start lagging behind once the contract expires or, 
worse, that the company will follow the example of other auto industry 
employers that have moved jobs to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The Delco Remy employees have drawn support from a Michigan-based dissident 
workers group known as UAW Concerned that also has squabbled with both the 
union and management. UAW Concerned styles itself as a defender of the 
so-called GM gypsies, the moniker sometimes used for auto workers around the 
country who have been bounced from one plant to another due to layoffs and 
reorganizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of UAW Concerned accuse the union and GM, in the case of Delco Remy 
and in other instances, of deception, circumventing seniority rights and 
allowing temporary workers to displace longtime employees at certain plants. 
</P>
<P>
 The UAW and GM "totally misled" the Van Nuys workers, said Darrel D. Jacobs, a 
lawyer for UAW Concerned who is preparing a lawsuit against the union. "What I 
can't figure out is why the union let GM get away with it." 
</P>
<P>
 GM and UAW officials denied the group's accusations.

CLOTHING LINE WINS BACKERS AND WEARERS; PLACENTIA FIRM'S SPORTSWEAR CARRIES 
SLOGANS OF LATINO PRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ISAAC GUZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Sportswear maker Mike Rodriguez finessed his way past security at last year's 
Los Angeles County Fair in Pomona to press a T-shirt and hat emblazoned with 
his Mojado Brothers company logo on comedian Paul Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I thought 'Who are you calling mojado? ' I felt insulted," said the 
Latino comedian and actor in describing his reaction to the term, whose literal 
translation is wet, but also means the pejorative "wetback" in Spanish slang. 
"Then I thought about it and I said 'Hey, that's cool,' " Paul Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cool enough for him to pledge a $50,000 investment and help enlist other 
Latino celebrities to endorse the company founded nearly three years ago by 
Mike Rodriguez and Dan Calderon, both Mexican Americans who grew up in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, who has been a silk screener and graphic designer in the garment 
industry for many years, teamed up with Calderon, who has a background in 
banking, to create a sportswear line specifically targeting Latino youth. In 
designing their clothes, the two took inspiration from the baggy pants, long 
shorts and loose fitting T-shirts favored by urban teens. 
</P>
<P>
 The founders also said they wanted to send a positive message about Latino 
identity and the commonality of Americans. They chose the term mojado , they 
explained, to "take the venom" out of a term that has long been an insult to 
Mexican Americans and immigrants from Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody had to cross some body of water to get here," said Calderon. "We 
are all mojado ." 
</P>
<P>
 But the provocative company name threatened to kill the young firm before it 
could even begin to reach its targeted market. The term mojado sometimes only 
appears on merchandise labels, but it is boldly incorporated into the design of 
many of the company's shirts and hats. J.C. Penney and Salt Lake City-based 
ZCMI department stores were among the first retailers to place orders, but they 
pulled thousands of the company's T-shirts from their racks when Latino 
employees and shoppers complained about the label. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few months ago, offended Latino dock workers at Mervyn's refused to 
unload a delivery of Mojado Brothers T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a hard time overcoming the expression mojado, " said Saul Grossman, 
whose Los Angeles-based Trans Color Co. distributes the Mojado Brothers line. 
"The artwork and concept have been very well accepted. The (store) buyers get 
hooked, but then they run away." 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman and buyers for many stores, including Mervyn's, J.C. Penney and the 
Broadway, have urged the young company to modify its label so that it will not 
offend. "Mo Bros" is the most common suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Why ignore the industry wisdom? 
</P>
<P>
 The partners "don't want to sell out like that. We like the provocativeness of 
mojado. We want the word to get people to think about what they're saying," 
Paul Rodriguez explained. 
</P>
<P>
 But a string of canceled orders forced the partners to realize they needed a 
strategy to persuade retailers that the merchandise was not too hot to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 They believed that they would have a wedge to get into stores if they could 
get Latino celebrities to wear their clothes and build a following among young 
Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 With Paul Rodriguez's help, they got their clothes on the backs of Latinos 
such as musician Carlos Santana, members of the pop music group Los Lobos, 
actors Edward James Olmos and Jimmy Smits, boxer Jorge Paez (who razor-cut the 
Mojado Brothers logo into his hair for a fight) and comedian Cheech Marin. 
</P>
<P>
 Among non-Latinos, comedian George Carlin has worn the shirts, and even O.J. 
Simpson attorney Robert Shapiro has given news conferences wearing a Mojado 
Brothers baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy has had some success. 
</P>
<P>
 In a crucial test for the company, the Broadway has accepted an order of 2,000 
T-shirts for 13 of its stores catering primarily to Latino customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadway buyer Danny Kim said the retailer was willing to take a chance on the 
line only after its own research concluded that the label would not offend 
Latino shoppers. The Broadway also asked that a tag explaining the Mojado 
Brothers' creed -- supporting education, racial harmony and "positive change" 
-- accompany each shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were concerned about people not understanding," Kim said. "We want to make 
sure customers know it's a Hispanic-owned company. We didn't want the T-shirt 
out there without some explanation." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim said the Broadway decided to make an extra effort for the line because it 
believes the company's sportswear has potential. "We think it's a pretty unique 
concept in department store mentality where everything is usually done for the 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, there have not been a lot of things targeted specifically for the 
Hispanic community. We carry ethnically influenced stuff, but nothing 
specifically done by an Hispanic company geared for the Hispanic customer," Kim 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the company was formed, Mike Rodriguez was the partner with experience in 
the garment industry. He already owned Soft Touch, a Placentia silk-screening 
plant that did contract work for other garment makers. The plant is now also 
the Mojado Brothers production facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Rodriguez serves as the company's creative force and Calderon looks after 
legal and financial issues. A fourth partner, Samm Pena, who had also been a 
partner with Paul Rodriguez in entertainment ventures, handles media and 
marketing for Mojado Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Rodriguez designs the T-shirts, which blend street-inspired designs with 
motifs borrowed from pre-Columbian and African folk art. The images have 
inspired distributors to coin a new marketing category specifically for the 
firm's line: Southwestern Surf. 
</P>
<P>
 All the shirts carry slogans of ethnic pride, peaceful coexistence or other 
messages of social responsibility. Among the nine Mojado Brothers designs 
accepted by the Broadway is a shirt that features two skeletons asking each 
other, "What color were you?" Mojado Brothers has 22 designs in total. 
</P>
<P>
 Trans Color's Grossman is hopeful that the company has won some converts to 
its point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could become a Cross Colours," said Grossman, referring to the rapid 
rise of the street-oriented African American-owned clothing company that made 
multimillion-dollar profits before running into financial difficulties last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mojado Brothers line is "an item whose time and concept have come . . . 
catering to a community that hasn't been catered to before," Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
 To strengthen grass-roots support, the firm is now promoting its merchandise 
with a nine-city comedy tour of the Southwest, including a show scheduled for 
Los Angeles next month. The tour, starring Latino comics, including Rene 
Sandoval, began in El Paso two weeks ago, playing to a sold-out audience, 
according to Mike Rodriguez. (Paul Rodriguez is expected to perform at some of 
the shows.) According to Mike Rodriguez, vendors at the El Paso show sold more 
than 500 Mojado Brothers T-shirts in one night. Many people asked how they 
could get the tour jackets and caps they saw on the comics, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of such enthusiastic response, the partners say they believe there is 
a market for a line of jackets, sweat shirts, shorts and jeans already designed 
by Mike Rodriguez.

2 OWNERS OF TMI FUND DISPUTE SUIT'S ALLEGATIONS; INVESTING: THEY RESPOND IN 
DETAIL TO FRAUD ACCUSATIONS, CALLING THEM UNTRUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The owners of Teachers Management & Investment Corp., the Newport Beach 
investment company accused in a civil lawsuit of fraudulently losing as much as 
$100 million it had raised from California teachers, said Sunday that they 
inherited most of their troubled company's problems and are doing their best to 
steer the real estate syndicate out of one of California's worst recessions. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times, the two men responded in detail to the suit 
filed Aug. 22 against them and their company. James R. Martin, 55, and Maurice 
Shuman, 56, both of Newport Beach said the suit's allegations that they lost 
$100 million of clients' retirement money through fraud and racketeering are 
simply untrue. 
</P>
<P>
 TMI, a 26-year-old fund marketed by teachers for teachers across the state, is 
insolvent, according to the suit filed in Orange County Superior Court by four 
investors. The suit seeks immediate appointment of a receiver to take over 
management of the company and whatever assets are left. 
</P>
<P>
 But Martin and Shuman insisted that their company is not insolvent. Rather, 
they said, TMI is profitable, though it is struggling to overcome not only the 
real estate downturn but also what the two men characterized as poor investment 
decisions made by the company's former owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Although company officials admit TMI's partnerships may have lost $100 million 
of value, they claim it is not because of any fraud but rather because of the 
real estate downturn. They also say the real estate partnerships only raised 
about $500 million, rather than the $1 billion claimed in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately owned TMI was formed in 1968 by a group of educators and real estate 
specialists as a vehicle for teachers and school administrators to sweeten 
their retirement pots. Over the years, TMI has, through its limited 
partnerships, owned a number of commercial properties, including hotels in 
Northern California, office developments and the Parducci Winery lands in 
Mendicino County, and thousands of acres of undeveloped land. 
</P>
<P>
 When the California real estate market was booming during the 1970s and '80s, 
TMI investors often saw annual returns of more than 30%. When the market 
skidded in the late 1980s, those handsome returns ended. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview at TMI's Newport Beach headquarters, Martin maintained that 
TMI's "heart is with the teachers." He and Shuman also answered specific 
questions about the company's history and current status. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Is $100 million of investors' funds missing? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: (Martin) Absolutely not. I think those kinds of statements are 
completely irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is TMI about to file for bankruptcy? 
</P>
<P>
 A: (Martin) We are profitable. I cannot release the numbers. But we have 
absolutely no plans to file bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The suit alleges that there was fraud at your company -- an "undisclosed 
pattern of self-dealing" -- that the management was siphoning off millions of 
dollars of investors' funds to affiliated companies that you controlled. How do 
you respond? 
</P>
<P>
 A: (Martin) I want you to remember one thing: All these partnerships were 
audited by (KPMG) Peat Marwick. It's pretty simple to follow the dollars here. 
This is not a maze. Every dollar we get is specifically set out in footnotes in 
the partnership reports, so every partner knows where the dollars went -- 
whether it's to TMI or an affiliate. There are no secrets. There is no hiding 
anything. It's just a ludicrous statement that anyone is hiding anything. Now, 
you could argue over whether it was proper or not. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Was it proper? 
</P>
<P>
 A: (Martin) Obviously, these people (the investors) believe that nothing 
should be spent on entitlements. And that's absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You mentioned the Peat Marwick reports. Why did Peat Marwick say in its 
latest statements that it couldn't issue an opinion, saying no current 
appraisal on your property values was available? 
</P>
<P>
 A: (Martin) I can't answer for them. But I think anyone is concerned in this 
real estate market. Everyone is scared and cautious in this market. We 
certainly are. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did you decide to buy TMI in 1987? 
</P>
<P>
 A: (Martin) It was very exciting. TMI had the capability of doing a lot of 
positive things. They had an excellent rapport with the educator world. They 
had made a tremendous track record with investments with very high-yielding 
returns. They made a lot of people's lives better. So that was the appeal. They 
had the portfolio and the track record in the past, and the marketplace still 
looked very. . . . It was a different picture then. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You mentioned one of the things that attracted you to the company was its 
sales force: teachers. Wasn't this the classic example of an affinity group 
that is marketed to people from their peers, or people they trust? 
</P>
<P>
 A: (Martin) I think that there is a personality to TMI. It was formed by 
educators who wanted to invest in real estate like the bigwigs. And they were 
pretty well prevented from doing that because of the net worth they had. So 
some forward-looking teachers formed this. And TMI has survived real estate 
cycles for 27 years with a community of teachers who were really the basic 
investors, and a community of school-teacher friends who generally also bought 
the product and sold it to their friends. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think the teachers truly understood the risks in investing in real 
estate partnerships? 
</P>
<P>
 A: (Martin) I think a lot of them didn't. I think a lot were naive. There had 
been this pattern of incredible returns. . . . They are very good people, and I 
think they are very deserving. I wish we could deliver all victories for them. 
Unfortunately, we are not in control of the economics of the state of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why did TMI target teachers' retirement funds? 
</P>
<P>
 A: (Martin) We don't take anyone's pension funds. We don't specifically offer 
retirement investments. We don't use the word retirements. These were just 
investments like somebody might have bought a share of stock, a mutual fund. 
They were limited partnerships, a pretty common investment vehicle in the 
1960s, '70s and '80s. But they were not retirement funds. We don't have any 
pension funds purchasing raw land. . . . . Now, people might have intended 
these investments to be used to retire with, and many of our limited partners 
did that and made substantial returns, so it did help them to retire. But we 
weren't selling retirement funds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why not try to sell this company? I heard you were in discussions with Koll 
Real Estate Group. 
</P>
<P>
 A: (Shuman) We have had discussions with several people, and, yes, some were 
with Koll. But people are concerned about the liability. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The state Department of Real Estate is investigating.  
</P>
<P>
 A: (Martin) I think that will be very positive for us. We've been totally 
cooperative, and we think they will find a clean bill of health. We are not 
aware of any SEC investigation.

 Intercity Virtual Reality Debut: Virtual World, the Glendale-based high-tech 
entertainment company run by Tim Disney (Walt's grandnephew), plans to launch a 
service Thursday that will allow consumers in its five U.S. locations to play 
the firm's sophisticated video games with each other using phone lines and 
computers. The network takes advantage of the increasing availability of a 
high-speed, low-cost phone technology known as Integrated Services Digital 
Network, which is provided by local phone companies."Pilots" at Virtual World's 
centers in San Diego; Walnut Creek, Calif.; Chicago; Dallas, and Las Vegas will 
be able to interact in real time as they maneuver through computer simulations. 
They will also be able to communicate on-line via CompuServe and a video 
speaker phone. A Los Angeles-based Virtual World center is scheduled to open 
later this year.

 Macy-Federated Merger: Californians will get their first glimpse this week of 
a consolidation plan for Federated Department Stores and R.H. Macy & Co., the 
New York-based retailer that operates the Bullock's and I. Magnin chains in 
Southern California. Cincinnati-based Federated is expected to file the plan -- 
known as a disclosure statement -- in a New York Bankruptcy Court on 
Thursday.The statement will include references to plans for combining 
operations. However, full details on possible store closings, store conversions 
and layoffs are expected to be included in amendments filed in September. 
Federated, which will eliminate duplicative administrative operations when the 
companies merge, is expected to eliminate some jobs at San Francisco-based 
Macy's West, the regional headquarters for Macy. Some analysts also expect 
Federated to close some I. Magnin stores in Southern California. Federated 
plans to combine the operations of the two companies by December.

 Airline Comments Due: Thursday is the deadline for comments from airlines and 
other interested parties on a plan by John Wayne Airport that could open the 
Orange County facility to more competition.The proposed changes would allow 
airlines to invite other carriers to share their coveted landing slots at the 
noise-restricted airport. The changes would also help low-cost, low-fare 
carriers such as Reno Air begin service even if they cannot win landing slots 
on their own. They would also permit airlines to put up signs advertising their 
corporate links to international carriers, even though those carriers do not 
serve the airport. USAir, for instance, wants to promote its flight connections 
with British Airways.

 Gentlemen, Start Your Wrecking Crane: The first of 1,000 pre-1982 cars that 
the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District is buying back in a bid to 
reduce smog will be flattened today at a wrecking yard in San Diego. The car, a 
1980 Ford Pinto, will be flattened to 18 inches high and sold as scrap to a 
state-licensed dismantler.Working through San Diego Environmental Exchange, a 
private contractor, the district pays $700 for cars made in 1981 or earlier, 
provided they are registered and in working order. Sellers also receive a $300 
voucher from one of 20 participating new-car dealers. The program was designed 
to help rid the county of vehicles that account for an estimated 30% of San 
Diego County's air pollution. Before the cars are flattened, the engine blocks 
are pierced to prevent them from being recycled, SDEE Vice President Jim Lantry 
said. The catalytic converters are also smashed to prevent reuse.

 Rail-Merger Opposition Builds: The California Public Utilities Commission 
added its voice to that of electric utilities and unions in voicing concerns 
about the proposed merger of Burlington Northern Inc. and Santa Fe Pacific 
Corp., which would create the nation's largest railroad. The state agency urged 
the Interstate Commerce Commission to reject the fast-track approach to the 
proposed merger. Utilities and unions urged an outright rejection in comments 
to federal regulators last week, predicting reduced competition and fewer jobs.

 Japan plans to turn the tables on American negotiators by arguing that U.S. 
government procurement practices in two key areas are even less open to 
outsiders than Japan's, news reports said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics compiled by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade show the 
U.S. government buys even less foreign telecommunications and medical equipment 
than Japan does, the Japan Broadcasting Corp. said, quoting unnamed officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, frustrated with the lack of progress in talks on improving 
access to Japan's lucrative government procurement market, has imposed a Sept. 
30 deadline for agreement before it moves toward sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The television report said Japan planned to present the findings, which the 
government says "fundamentally undermine" the American position, to U.S. 
negotiators and urge them not to impose sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Japanese nor U.S. officials were available for comment on the report. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Japanese officials have responded to U.S. accusations of unfair 
trading with accusations of their own, issuing reports detailing various 
offenses of the United States and other nations while claiming Japanese markets 
are open. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics indicated that while Japanese government purchases of foreign 
telecommunications equipment were just 0.6% of the total in 1991, the 
corresponding figure in the United States was even lower at 0.07%, the news 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreign share of government purchases of medical equipment, meanwhile, was 
38.5% in Japan and 1.5% in the United States, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States argues that unclear procurement procedures in Japan have 
kept its share of Japanese government medical equipment purchases down to 20%, 
even though in other markets it has a 40% to 50% market share. 
</P>
<P>
 The two nations have failed to reach agreement in the current talks on autos 
and auto parts, insurance, financial services and other products. A partial 
agreement on patents was signed earlier this month.

 Job Growth Projected to Remain Steady: More than quarter of employers plan to 
hire more workers in the fourth quarter of 1994, and 61% expect no change, 
according to a nationwide survey of 15,000 businesses. The projections by 
Manpower, a temporary help agency, indicated that only 10% of the companies 
expect to cut jobs and that 3% were uncertain about employment levels.

 Machine Tool Orders Fall: July orders for U.S.-manufactured machine tools 
declined 14.6% from the previous month, to $344.75 million but remained 
substantially above year-ago levels, according to the Assn. for Manufacturing 
Technology. Machine tool orders through July of this year are running 23.6% 
higher than for the seven-month period in 1993. Orders of machine tools are 
considered an indicator of future manufacturing and economic activity.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: HAVE STOCKS BROKEN INTO THE CLEAR AT LAST? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO

<TEXT>
<P>
 Many Wall Streeters are dubious about last week's big rally in stocks. But 
Stefan Abrams, investment strategist at giant Trust Co. of the West, thinks 
it's foolish to underestimate this market. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Abrams believes the Federal Reserve Board has given the market exactly 
what it has been praying for: an economy growing at a moderate pace, without 
undue upward pressure on long-term bond yields or inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The July durable-goods orders report last Wednesday and the second-quarter 
gross domestic product revision on Friday both suggested that growth is 
slowing, which must in large part be attributable to the Fed's five 
credit-tightening moves since Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Abrams, who helps manage $50 billion at giant TCW, gushes with praise for Fed 
Chairman Alan Greenspan. "He's proving to be the most skillful Fed chief since 
(William) McChesney Martin," who ruled the Fed from 1951 to 1970, Abrams 
argues. 
</P>
<P>
 The way he sees it, Greenspan has brilliantly managed the Fed's program to 
keep the economy from overheating. First, Abrams notes, Greenspan has been 
telling investors in advance what the Fed plans to do, which "gives the markets 
time to condition themselves" rather than be taken by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, Abrams lauds Greenspan for abandoning the Fed's initial plan of 
quarter-point increases in short-term interest rates, in favor of half-point 
increases on May 16 and again on Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of nickel-and-diming the markets to death with frequent quarter-point 
hikes, the Fed's use of half-point increases that are more spaced out provides 
time for the nation's economy -- and investors -- to digest the effect of 
higher rates without excessive trauma, Abrams says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bigger boosts less frequently give corporate profits a chance to catch up to 
the higher level of interest rates," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 And make no mistake, Abrams says: Corporate profits will continue to grow. 
While the Fed's rate hikes have slowed the housing sector and auto sales, 
Abrams believes investors are underestimating the potential for continued 
strong export growth at American companies large and small, as the world 
economy revives. 
</P>
<P>
 Export demand, he says, will offset slower domestic growth enough to keep the 
economy on the moderate track that the Fed, and the markets, view as idyllic. 
</P>
<P>
 At TCW, Abrams says, "The CEOs of all the major companies come through here 
once a year, and they're all telling us that all of their growth for the rest 
of the century will be coming from overseas." 
</P>
<P>
 But the market has yet to fully grasp the importance of international business 
for a soaring number of American companies, Abrams argues. As more investors 
come to understand how large a contribution foreign sales will make to 
corporate earnings, he says, stock prices will increasingly be viewed as 
undervalued. 
</P>
<P>
 At current price levels, the average blue chip stock sells for about 16 times 
estimated 1994 earnings per share. 
</P>
<P>
 By Abrams' calculations based on profit growth and interest rates, stock 
prices on average should be 10% higher, he says. That would put the Dow 
industrial average at about 4,270, versus 3,881.05 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy who tells you the market is overvalued is living in the past," Abrams 
says. 
</P>

 Making Money Again: One of the psychological negatives for the market since 
March has been that most money managers and small investors have been fighting 
just to get back to even for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 After last week's rally, that barrier has finally been hurdled. 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of last week, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was at 
463.68, or 0.6% below its year-end close of 466.45. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite several rally attempts since the market's late-March plunge, the S&P 
had been unable to rise past its year-end level. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now. With last week's 2.2% surge in the S&P, the index closed Friday at 
473.80, which means it's up 1.6% year to date. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, the Dow industrials and the New York Stock Exchange composite index 
also are back in the black for the year. Still in the red, but coming up fast, 
are smaller-stock measures such as the Nasdaq composite and the Russell 2,000 
index. 
</P>
<P>
 The significance of these indexes being above their 1993 closes is that money 
managers and individuals may begin to feel more confident about putting new 
money to work, if they're no longer in the hole with their existing portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
 For most small investors, a more important indicator than the broad market 
indexes is the return on the average stock mutual fund. At June 30, the average 
general stock fund was down 5.84% year to date, according to fund-tracker 
Lipper Analytical Services in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 By last Thursday, the average fund's year-to-date loss had shrunk to 0.4%. 
Lipper calculates the average returns only once a week (on Thursdays), but 
given the magnitude of Friday's stock market rally, it's likely that the 
typical fund now is even with the year or slightly ahead -- for the first time 
since March. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly: Further proof that stocks are insistent on going their own way, 
perhaps regardless of what happens with bonds: The benchmark 30-year Treasury 
bond yield closed last week at 7.48%, exactly where it finished the week 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the stock market managed to rally spectacularly even though 
bonds didn't, despite new evidence pointing to slower economic growth. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A New York Times story last week caused a stir by noting that a chunk of last 
Wednesday's 70.90-point Dow rally was the product of institutional trading 
games in the session's final minutes, involving specialized stock-option 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 But some money managers warn against trying to paint the rally as artificial. 
As with "program" trading in the late-1980s, options games today generally 
don't create market trends -- they just magnify moves already underway. Back 
Into the Black 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's rally in stocks was powerful enough to lift some of the market's 
key indexes back into positive territory for the year-to-date, for the first 
time since last winter. 06,18,10,11,10,14,08 Change Fri. Pct. change: Index

CAPITAL GAINS EXCLUSION ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME BREAK; TAXATION: PROVISION PRESENTS 
COMPLICATIONS WHEN WIDOWED OR DIVORCED PEOPLE REMARRY IN THEIR LATER YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When you are navigating the tricky waters of the U.S. tax system, even the 
most generous benefits need to be approached with caution. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider, for example, the much-beloved capital gains exclusion that people 
age 55 or over can claim when they sell a home. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, this tax break certainly seems simple and sensible enough. To 
allow for the effects of inflation over the years and help people finance their 
retirements, the law permits older Americans to exempt up to $125,000 in 
profits on the sale of a primary residence from any tax liability. 
</P>
<P>
 But as soon as you get to the provision in the rules that limits this break to 
once in a lifetime, the situation starts to get more complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 In a case that eventually wound up in the Tax Court, a woman who sold a home 
in 1988 sought to claim the exclusion on her $112,000 gain. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a hitch, however, involving a previous home sale by the same woman, 
in 1979, which produced a $7,000 profit. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, she had reinvested all the proceeds in a home of equal or 
greater value, thus qualifying for mandatory deferral of all capital gains 
taxes under a separate provision of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, her accountant had elected the 55-and-over exclusion (covered 
by Section 121 of the Tax Code) anyway on her tax return for that year. 
</P>
<P>
 That should make no difference, the woman argued. Since the law required her 
to defer taxes on the 1979 sale, she was ineligible to claim the 55-and-over 
exclusion for that deal, and thus should be allowed to use it for the 1988 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 But the court said no. "The Code Section 121 election could have been revoked 
at any time before the statute of limitations expired, that is, within three 
years of filing the '79 return," said the Research Institute of America, a New 
York-based publisher of tax information. 
</P>
<P>
 "Failing to act within that time period, she cannot now revoke the election." 
</P>
<P>
 At a capital gains tax rate of 28%, that adds up to a $31,360 mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Timing of the 55-and-over exclusion can also be a minefield for widowed or 
divorced people who marry again in their later years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If one spouse has already taken advantage of the exclusion before a marriage, 
then after the marriage both are prohibited from taking another exclusion," 
noted Cynthia Saltzman and Kenn Tacchino of Widener University in Chester, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 "This brings up an interesting planning opportunity," Saltzman and Tacchino 
wrote in the Journal of Financial Planning. 
</P>
<P>
 "If two individuals over 55 are contemplating getting married, and both have 
homes, it is best to sell the houses before the marriage so that both parties 
can take advantage of the exclusion, assuming neither party has a previous 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition, if one of the would-be newlyweds has used the exclusion, it may 
drive the decision to sell the other's home (taking the exclusion) before the 
marriage and live in the home of the one who previously used the exclusion." 
</P>
<P>
 Many other issues may also complicate the decision of whether to take the 
exclusion now, or keep it in reserve for possible future use. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to all the personal matters that may arise in any individual case, 
there is the question of whether Congress might sooner or later increase the 
limit on how much can be excluded, which was last raised -- from $100,000 to 
$125,000 -- in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," say Saltzman and Tacchino, "speculation of this kind may not be 
prudent planning considering that Congress is looking for ways to increase 
revenues, not expand tax breaks."

FUND MANAGER BLAZES OWN TRAIL IN INVESTMENT JUNGLE; PROFILE: G. KENNETH 
HEEBNER'S CGM CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT WAS ONE OF PETER LYNCH'S MAIN RIVALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STAN HINDEN, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is how the future looks to G. Kenneth Heebner, one of the nation's top 
mutual-fund managers: The rise in interest rates is not going to derail the 
economy; stable food and energy prices will keep inflation in check, and real 
estate will once again become a money-making investment. 
</P>
<P>
 If these forecasts sound contrary to what you've been hearing from Wall 
Street, it's not surprising. Heebner, the 53-year-old manager of the top-rated 
CGM Capital Development Fund in Boston, has always liked to blaze his own trail 
through the investment jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to have a viewpoint that is not widely believed" on Wall Street, 
Heebner said. His reason: If others don't share his investment ideas, he can 
buy the stocks he likes before they go up. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not as well-known as the fabled Peter Lynch, former manager of the 
Fidelity Magellan Fund, Heebner was one of Lynch's main rivals during the 
decade of the 1980s and early 1990s -- with their returns running 
neck-and-neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Magellan has dropped down the list, but CGM Capital Development remains the 
second-best performing stock fund for the last 10 years and the third best for 
the past five years, as of June 30, according to Lipper Analytical Services 
Inc. CGM Capital, which invests in growth stocks, is now closed to new 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Heebner's best years was in 1991, when health and food stocks helped 
power his fund to a 99% gain. This year, though, has been a tough one. He has 
made big bets on industrial companies -- including autos, building materials 
and paper products -- in the belief their earnings and their stocks would 
benefit from a strengthening economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Those stocks did gain last year but were knocked back when the Federal Reserve 
raised interest rates. Some investors became convinced -- wrongly so, Heebner 
thinks -- that business would weaken and the country might go back into 
recession. So they sold the stocks that Heebner favors. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Heebner's fund, which has $457 million invested in 25 stocks, 
dropped 15% by June 30. In recent days, economically sensitive stocks have 
started to rebound and Heebner's fund is now down about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to stay ahead of the crowd is not a risk-free strategy and Heebner 
admits he has made his share of mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sort of accept the fact that you are going to be wrong a certain portion of 
the time and you're going to lose money," he said. "But the important thing in 
stock investing is to position yourself in front of a big winner." 
</P>
<P>
 When Heebner talks about "big winners," he is talking about companies like 
Stone Container Corp., a maker of corrugated containers and liner board -- used 
for the outer shell of boxes. Heebner has more than 5% of his fund's money in 
Stone, whose shares sell for $18, up from $6.50 a year ago. A stronger economy 
has produced a greater demand for boxes, allowing Stone to steadily increase 
its prices for liner board from $290 a ton last year to $425 a ton, starting 
Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Heebner also has invested heavily in steel, gypsum and chemical companies. His 
biggest holding is National Gypsum Co., which produces wallboard. Other 
investments include LTV Corp., a steel company, and Geon Co., a chemical firm. 
All three have shown sizable gains since last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many on Wall Street, Heebner is not fearful of rising interest rates. 
"The rise in short-term rates that we've seen, which may continue, is not going 
to interfere with very strong growth in our economy and the other economies 
around the world, . . ." he said. "I think we are going to have a strong 
economy in 1995 and 1996." 
</P>
<P>
 As for inflation, Heebner foresees no great pickup in the next 12 months 
because there is little pressure for higher wages and the cost of food and 
energy remains stable. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Heebner, expects increasing demand and rising prices for a variety of 
industrial commodities. Beyond his interest in steel and liner board, Heebner 
said he prefers not to be specific about the commodities where he expects 
rising prices -- lest he tip his hand on which stocks he is buying. 
</P>
<P>
 Heebner, who has managed CGM Capital since 1976, considers himself an 
old-fashioned "earnings driven" investor. "I would have to tell you that stocks 
respond to earnings the same way now they did 20 years ago," he said. Strong 
earnings send stock prices up, weak earnings send them down, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What has changed, he acknowledged, is the speed with which electronic systems 
alert all of Wall Street to financial events. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in turn, causes stock prices to respond to news much more quickly than 
before. Heebner was asked whether that had made his job as a money manager more 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're sort of raising the question: With all that expertise and all those 
smart people out there, is it hard to make money? You know something? I'm 
heavily invested in the steel industry. I was able to get into the steel 
industry I think at a time when no one was paying much attention. And all these 
brains and all this money hasn't really changed that," Heebner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heebner said he looks at the research provided by Wall Street brokerage firms 
but also studies raw data on many industries. He has a "tremendous conviction" 
that the global economy will grow rapidly in the next two years. Indeed, he 
said, one of the reasons he is focusing on industrial cyclical stocks is that 
he expects a sharp rise in the global demand for raw materials.

 Shipyard Workers End 2-Month Strike: Korean workers last week ended two months 
of crippling strikes that cost the world's largest shipyard more than $1 
billion. With the acceptance of a new wage contract with Hyundai Heavy 
Industries, normal operations were expected to resume Wednesday after workers 
return from their summer vacations.The relatively peaceful resolution of the 
labor dispute in the southern industrial city of Ulsan also marked a success 
for the government's new hands-off policy toward labor disputes. The government 
had refused requests by management to order binding arbitration and refrained 
from using police to break up rallies by the hard-line unionists. The shipyard 
is a subsidiary of the Hyundai group, the maker of Hyundai cars, semiconductors 
and electronic goods. Hyundai was the second-largest South Korean conglomerate 
last year in sales volume.

 The agreements are expected to be the first of many signed to be this week in 
China. Brown has said he expects American companies will sign several billion 
dollars worth of contracts as while he's in Asia, reducing the U.S.'s 
$22.8-billion trade deficit in 1993 with China. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, International Business Machines Corp. is expected to sign 
agreements with the Chinese Ministry of Electronics, a senior administration 
official said. Details weren't immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
 China, viewed as a potential gold mine for many American companies, will spend 
hundreds of billions of dollars over the next several years. The country plans 
to install power facilities and millions of phone lines, buy aircraft, upgrade 
its air traffic control system and builds highways and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be one or two other signings (Monday) that could be quite large . . 
. larger than a billion dollars," said a U.S. trade official. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the $140-million Westinghouse agreement, the company will manufacture 
two 350-megawatt steam turbine-generators for the Jiangsu Ligang Electric Power 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Sargent & Lundy, a U.S. engineering firm, will provide plant engineering for 
the power generation equipment at the plant, which will be located on the 
Yangtze River. The Export-Import Bank will finance the agreement. Details of 
the financing weren't immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
 Westinghouse hopes this contract will be the first of many in China. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning the intense competition for this order demonstrates our commitment to 
provide cost-effective solutions to China's need for power," Michael Jordan, 
president and chief executive, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary Brown said the contract will provide support for an unidentified 
number of American jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 It comes a year after Brown sponsored the U.S. Electric Power Mission to China 
in an effort to overcome obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 Westinghouse, based in Pittsburgh, supplies air traffic control systems, power 
generation supplies and business communications systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Pitney Bowes' $20-million agreement, the company will develop a 
marketing and business plan for upgrading and modernizing China's postal 
system. Pitney Bowes will also install its products at the post offices and 
other government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement comes seven weeks after Pitney Bowes appointed Zhongyu Postal 
Code and Information Co. as its exclusive distributor of its mailing machines 
and postage meters in China. There are 55,000 post offices in China. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agreement reflects the urgent desire on the part of the Chinese 
government to modernize and automate all Chinese offices in general, and post 
offices in particular, through the application of state-of-the-art systems and 
equipment," said George Harvey, chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 The equipment for this contract will be made in Pitney Bowes' Connecticut 
facilities and will be distributed through Zhongyu's six postal branches. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitney Bowes, based in Stamford, Conn., makes mailing, shipping, copying and 
voice processing equipment.

 Some Foreign Firms to Get Tax Refunds: China has begun to refund taxes to 
about one-third of its foreign-funded ventures that have been hurt by a new tax 
system, the New China news agency said. Foreign-funded firms approved by 
authorities before Dec. 31 will get rebates for their increased tax burden for 
up to five years, the agency reported. One-third of foreign-funded ventures are 
hurt by a new tax system, including a value added tax, which went into effect 
this year, while one-third gained from it, said Dong Shukui, deputy director of 
the State Administration of Taxation's tax department.

THE PACIFIC; AIRPORT EXPECTED TO HELP REGION TAKE OFF; JAPAN: NEW OSAKA 
FACILITY IS KEY TO A STRATEGY TO MAKE THE AREA A CENTER FOR ASIAN BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is the most expensive airport ever built -- 50% over budget when all was 
said and done. 
</P>
<P>
 It has overcome serious engineering problems -- namely the instability of the 
ground of the artificial island three miles offshore in Osaka Bay on which it 
rests. 
</P>
<P>
 When it opens on Sunday, the owner of the new $15-billion Kansai International 
Airport will be facing interest payments of $580 million a year and operating 
deficits for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 But the huge project will be enthusiastically welcomed by this city -- Japan's 
second largest -- which sees the airport as key to its bid to become a major 
Pacific Rim transportation hub. The airport also is the centerpiece in a broad 
effort to boost the economy of the Osaka area and make it a regional center for 
Asian business. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-prefecture area known as Kansai -- which in addition to Osaka includes 
the ancient capital of Kyoto and the internationally flavored port city of Kobe 
-- has a population of 20 million. With an annual output of $800 billion, 
Kansai's economic power exceeds that of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet until now, Kansai has had only one airport of any significance: the 
relatively small Itami airport in Osaka. Even worse, Itami has had rather few 
international connections and flights are banned after 9 p.m. because of the 
number of homes nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus the new airport -- Japan's first 24-hour facility -- aims to unleash the 
power of this region by ending its relative isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 It was designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano as a modernistic reflection 
of old European arch-roofed train terminals. But it has been plagued by major 
setbacks, the most serious being unexpectedly severe -- and uneven -- 
subsidence of the man-made island, which is still sinking at the rate of more 
than an inch per month. Buildings had to be built on jacks to keep them level, 
and the runway is asphalt for easy repaving. 
</P>
<P>
 But local people say they are confident that in the long run, the facility 
will prove its worth. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think about the 21st Century, it's a huge plus," said Sachiko Yoshimi, 
55, who works for a garment wholesaler. "It's absolutely necessary in order for 
Osaka to be able to grow." 
</P>
<P>
 The airport is the core effort among 866 large-scale urban development 
projects underway in the region, at a total cost of more than $410 billion. 
These range from the recently opened Asia and Pacific Trade Center, a 
waterfront complex focused on retailing and wholesaling of imported consumer 
goods, to an expanding set of research institutes collectively known as Kansai 
Science City. 
</P>
<P>
 These projects are partly intended to ease the over-centralization in Tokyo of 
Japanese economic life, a situation that creates a variety of anomalies and 
inefficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Publishing, as just one example, is so heavily concentrated in the capital 
that national distribution networks radiate only from there. Cazi Cazi, a young 
men's fashion magazine published in Osaka that has most of its circulation in 
the Kansai region, must ship its entire press run to Tokyo. There, it is loaded 
on trucks along with other publications and sent back to Kansai for 
distribution to retail outlets. Cazi Cazi Editor Kazuyuki Hamahata expressed 
hope that the new airport will stimulate enough economic growth and improvement 
of local distribution networks to eventually change this situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials are already using the new airport to promote the idea of Osaka 
as an international base for business activities in East Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Osaka businesses have traditionally had close ties with Seoul, South Korea, 
and Taipei, Taiwan. Kansai-based industries have also played a major role in 
Japan's accelerating transfer of manufacturing to Southeast Asia and China -- a 
trend encouraged by the yen's recent strengthening against the dollar, which 
makes it cheaper to manufacture goods abroad. Travel to any of these Asian 
places will be significantly quicker and easier from Osaka than from Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like global enterprises to put their Asian strategic headquarters 
here, and we hope that Asian companies will put their bases in Osaka for 
expanding globally," said Kenichi Nagata, chief planner for the Osaka city 
government. "Many headquarters are located in Tokyo or Hong Kong for those 
purposes, but we hope to attract them here." 
</P>
<P>
 Nagata cited a survey showing that Tokyo still has a big edge in terms of 
business opportunities but that Osaka comes out ahead in other factors also 
important to companies -- particularly the cost of office space and the quality 
of life for employees. Statistics collected by the Osaka city government show 
office space costs average about 80% higher in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies from Taiwan have so far taken the largest number of wholesale spots 
at the Asia and Pacific Trade Center, where they market home electronics, 
jewelry and clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport belongs to a public-private consortium created by various local 
governments and more than 1,000 private companies, in addition to the national 
government for the purpose of bringing the region a first-class airport. It is 
expected at first to handle about 50 international and 70 domestic flights a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 With heavy interest payments on construction loans, the airport will run a 
huge deficits for at least the next few years, despite landing fees matching 
those at Tokyo as the highest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Times researcher Chiaki Kitada in Tokyo contributed to this story.

 GDP Forecast Raised: The government is now forecasting that economic growth 
this year, as measured by gross domestic product figures, will be 5.7%.The 
figure, released in its half-yearly economic report, is based on a revised 
formula for calculation that takes into account structural change in the 
economy. Under the old formula, the government had been forecasting GDP growth 
of 5.5% for 1994. Using the new method, Hong Kong's GDP growth has been revised 
upward to 5.9% in 1993 from a previous estimate of 5.6%, and 6.0% in 1992 
against 5.6% before.

TV MAKERS WATCHING FOR A SECOND RECORD YEAR OF SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 TVs are big this year -- in sales and size. 
</P>
<P>
 So big in sales that makers are a little worried about meeting demand in 
December and January, their biggest sales period. 
</P>
<P>
 And so big in size that delivery crews are now packing tools and extra padding 
to remove doors and squeeze down hallways. 
</P>
<P>
 "We run into problems getting into people's houses, especially in areas of the 
East and West where homes are smaller," said Chuck Cebuhar, general manager of 
the home electronics business at Sears, Roebuck & Co. "They go in with tools 
they're going to need to make some tight turns and stand the TVs on ends." 
</P>
<P>
 After going through a slump during the recession from 1990 to '92, the U.S. TV 
business is turning in a second consecutive record sales year. About 12 million 
color TVs were sold from January through July, up 6% from the same period for 
1993, according to the Electronics Industries Assn. More than 24 million are 
expected to be sold in all of 1994, contrasted with 23.1 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of more expensive projection TVs were up 37%, with more than 125,000 
sold through the first seven months of the year. And sales the TV-VCR hybrids 
that took off in 1993 have been up 55% rate, with more than 1 million sold 
through July.  
</P>
<P>
 The sales figures are being driven by increased consumer confidence and lower 
prices for models with big screens, executives said. 
</P>
<P>
 "While most of us were quite bullish in terms of what we thought the business 
was going to be like this year, it's turned out to be a pleasant surprise," 
said Gerald McCarthy, an executive with Zenith Electronics Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought we'd build this many color TV sets," said Joe Clayton, vice 
president of sales at Thomsen Electronics, the No. 1 TV maker. It expects to 
sell 5 million sets this year under the RCA and GE brands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's higher than expected because the economy's bounce helped," Clayton said. 
"We had a strong '93 coming back and are having an even stronger '94." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the drop in prices for larger screen TVs that has fed much of the sales 
growth. Faced with a price difference of $200 or less, many people who had been 
considering 19- or 20-inch TVs are buying 25- or 27-inch models. And some 
owners of mid-size TVs are moving up even though their current TVs are fine. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, 25-inch models are outselling 19- and 20-inch models, said 
Cynthia Upson, spokeswoman for the Electronics Industries Assn. The trade group 
that estimates 42% of all TVs sold in the first seven months of the year had 
screens 25 inches or larger.

ANN CONWAY: A GLANCE AT A SILENT EYE DISEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Floss Schumacher could see the enormous chandelier featured in "The Phantom of 
the Opera" when she caught the production at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center last week. 
</P>
<P>
 And she could make out the phantom's mask, "because I knew it was there," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when Christine pulled the mask off the Phantom, I couldn't see him. His 
face meant nothing. If it was disfigured, I wouldn't have known." 
</P>
<P>
 Like her friend Mary Lou Hopkins Hornsby, Schumacher suffers from macular 
degeneration, an eye disease that can rob the aging of their central vision, 
leaving their peripheral vision intact. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't see a face on stage anymore," says Schumacher, who has been an arts 
activist in Orange County since the '60s. "I can make out forms, color, hear 
the words, the singing. But not faces. We have had to change our seats at 
Segerstrom Hall to up front, where perspiration can blow in your face." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Schumacher said of his wife: "She can no longer recognize people readily. 
She'll come up to someone she has known for years, and she'll have this kind of 
blind look on her face. People don't know if she's snubbing them or mad at them 
because she doesn't immediately detect who they are. 
</P>
<P>
 "The great concern I've had is that this will cause a severe depression for 
her . . . and that someday, after I'm gone, she will be very incapacitated. 
This gives me great apprehension." 
</P>
<P>
 For Hornsby, whose degeneration is less severe that Schumacher's, the worst 
part of the disease is the "loss of independence." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't drive at night anymore," said Hornsby, a charity activist who once 
covered society for The Times. "I don't feel comfortable on the freeway. I have 
to be very careful to travel routes where there is little traffic. I've always 
been so independent that this is hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Both women, who are in their 70s, are angry about the public's ignorance of 
the disease. "Nobody seems to have gotten the word out," Hornsby said. "If 
people knew about it, they might not be so frightened when they learn they have 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 She still seethes when she thinks about that day. "I went to an 
ophthalmologist for some new contact lenses, had an exam and came out 
devastated," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, during a visit to the Doheny Institute in Los Angeles, a doctor rattled 
off the visual abilities she would eventually lose -- "identifying people, 
watching TV, reading, threading a needle" -- as she sat there, stunned. 
"Nothing had ever prepared me for this," she said. "By the time he got to 
'threading a needle,' I was crying. And I cried all the way home." 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, Schumacher, now considered legally blind by the Braille 
Institute, noticed that her sight was failing. But she chalked it up to aging. 
"Of course my eyes are getting worse," she told herself. "I'm getting older." 
</P>
<P>
 But during a visit to an ophthalmologist, he screened her eyes for macular 
degeneration. "He gave me a grid with a dot in the center and told me to test 
myself, that if those little lines around the dot got wavy, to come back in. He 
didn't go into detail. Macular degeneration didn't mean a thing to me, didn't 
frighten me at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't do much about it -- we were busy, moving to the desert at the time 
-- until I got my desk set up and looked at the grid. I hadn't looked at it for 
weeks. It was bad . 
</P>
<P>
 "I came back to Orange County and began to see Dr. Kuppermann at UCI. He is a 
wonderful man." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ask ophthalmologist Baruch Kuppermann, chief of retina service at UCI, about 
the research being done for macular degeneration, the hope of finding a cure, 
and he sighs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pouring huge amounts of resources into coming up with cures and 
treatments for macular degeneration with, quite honestly, very limited success. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an incredibly frustrating disease. It's the leading cause of visual 
loss in the Western world for people over the age of 55. It can be very mild or 
very severe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here are these people who have led very productive lives, who may be enjoying 
retirement, and suddenly they can't do many of the things that give life 
pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
 The macula is a small, specialized area of the retina, the inside back lining 
of the eye, Kuppermann explained. Degeneration occurs when there is damage to 
the macula. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have found that the blue light in sunlight, which is made up of the colors 
of the rainbow, is toxic to the macula," Kuppermann said. (Wear blue-blocking 
sunglasses when you're in the sun, he suggests. They are the glasses with the 
lenses that are amber-brown in color.) 
</P>
<P>
 There is hope, someday, of "whole eye transplants," Kuppermann said. "At this 
point, they are a bit of a pipe dream, but possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "The complexity of the optic nerve (which is connected to the macula) is about 
the same as the complexity of the spinal column. So, about the time we can cure 
paralysis, we will be able to do whole eye transplants involving the optic 
nerve." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Schumacher, who lives in La Quinta, continues to search out optic 
aids to make her life more manageable. A magnifying glass has become her 
constant companion. And a closed-circuit television enables her to magnify the 
printed page on a screen. Her watch is now audio instead of visual. "And I get 
a lot of help from people," she said, smiling at Ed. "That keeps me going." 
</P>
<P>
 Hornsby has joined the Luminaires, a local support group for the Doheny Eye 
Institute in Los Angeles (which has a satellite clinic in Orange).  
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a great benefit coming up on Sept. 25 at the Newport Beach Yacht 
Club that will benefit vision research," she said. "KTLA's Stan Chambers will 
tell us about his 50 years in the business." The cost of the event, which 
includes dinner, is $75 per person. Call (714)-760-0407 for information.

JACK SMITH: RECALLING THE GOOD OLD DAYS . . . SORT OF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 T. Willard Hunter of Claremont writes to inform me that the "anonymous" essay 
on things we didn't have before 1941 was in fact written by Nardi Reeder 
Campion, Wellesley '38, for the Wellesley alumnae paper on her class's 45th 
reunion in 1983. It was called "The Class of 1938 B.C. (Before Computers)." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvin Borders of San Diego not only names Campion as the author but reminds me 
that I have quoted it before and that I wrote of meeting Campion at my home 
when she was in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 I am indeed embarrassed. One thing I had before 1938 was a good memory. I have 
just telephoned Campion at her home in Hanover, N.H., to apologize, and found 
her in good health and as sharp as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter notes that "the piece has been reproduced in countless alumni magazines 
and has been quoted at a thousand Rotary clubs. It's a very clever and durable 
piece." 
</P>
<P>
 Borders says: "Hundreds of versions have been circulated without credit or 
with dozens of pirates claiming authorship; none as good. But you should credit 
her. Most of your quotes were accurate." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few readers have complained that some of the items Campion mentions as not 
having existed in the 1930s actually did. For example, pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred A. Glienna writes that "pizza, of course, has been around for centuries." 
</P>
<P>
 "We discovered pizza at an early age," writes Bob Graham of Laguna Hills, 
"somewhat to the consternation of our Anglo-Saxon parents. Who could forget the 
sight of the baker in the pizzeria window spinning and tossing the dough into 
air as he created the thin, crisp crust of the true pizza?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, OK, they didn't have pizza at Wellesley. I ate my first pizza after 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard S. Krause argues that the author was only "autobiographically correct" 
in saying that we didn't have FM radio. I take that to mean we didn't have it 
in her experience. Mine either. Krause said FM had moved out of the 
experimental stage in 1941 and he worked in it.  
</P>
<P>
 Sonya and Roger Wing say we did have plastic in the form of Bakelite (a 
not-very-plastic substance). Also, they say, we had drip-dry clothes (sateen) 
and day-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Campion noted some social changes she and her classmates predated: "In 1938 
American schools were not desegregated; blacks were not allowed to play in the 
major leagues; the Daughters of the American Revolution would not let Marian 
Anderson sing in Constitution Hall; in 1938 'Made in Japan' meant junk; and the 
term 'making out' referred to how you did on an exam." 
</P>
<P>
 Campion also lists some of the things they did have in 1938, but not today: 
"We had girdles with garters on them and petticoats and serge bloomers for 
gym." She recalls that nude posture pictures were required for gym, and that 
the Harvard men tried to get their hands on them. I don't remember ever seeing 
a nude posture picture and I certainly never got my hands on one. 
</P>
<P>
 Campion also lists some of the things we do have now, but which she doesn't 
especially enjoy. "I don't go in for consciousness raising or sensitivity 
training. I don't like to jog. I don't like pesto sauce. I don't know how to 
pump my own gas. My legs are white and my stockings are brown when the opposite 
is the style. I'm not into veggies or yoga or Zen or punk. My idea of a good 
time is to walk with a man, not jog with a Walkman. I seek silence in a day 
when silence is as rare as a Gutenberg Bible. The man I live with is my 
husband, and after 42 years he's still the same one . . . how embarrassing."

 It seems incredible that we could have imagined ourselves happy in those days, 
without so many of today's conveniences. But Berkeley Hoffman observes that 
today is not so blissful, either. 
</P>
<P>
 He points out that in the late 1930s and '40s, a three-bedroom house cost 
$10,000. (We paid $8,525 for ours in 1950.) His 1949 Ford station wagon "with 
real wood sides" cost less than $3,000. Food costs have risen from $30 a month 
to $300, he says, and the food is not as fresh and is less healthful. He says 
salaries today, although higher, are not high enough to compensate for the 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today we have the 'pleasure' of pollution, smog, toxic waste, drugs, AIDS, 
gang killings, rude drivers, motion pictures with sex and violence and bad 
language. Music used to be Glenn Miller, Mancini, Goodman, Crosby, Sinatra, 
Gershwin, Kern and a few hundred more. There is no music today, just noise."  
</P>
<P>
 I don't know. I used to like Benny Goodman, and he was noisy. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, radio music isn't all bad. The other night my wife and I heard Gaetano 
Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore on KKGO. It was glorious. 
</P>
<P>
 But I wish I'd gone to Wellesley. It must have been fun.

 In the news: Comedy writer Alan Ray, on the Little League World Series: 
"Little League coaches don't have it easy. Pouting, tantrums, crying, jealousy. 
And once you get past the parents, you have to deal with the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray, on Chelsea Clinton's sailing lessons: "She takes to the water differently 
than her dad. She's on a 17-foot catamaran. He's on a sinking ship." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Bob Mills, on the Georgia school teacher disciplined because he 
denied students a moment of silence: "He obviously doesn't realize that kids 
today need some time to think: 'Did I remember to load my gun . . . pick up my 
free condoms . . . drop off the baby at day care?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mills, on the Wyoming legal group that is offering lawyers a monthlong 
workshop on a 3,000-acre ranch: "The complete $2,900 package includes 
transportation, lodging and three feeding frenzies a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Mark Miller, on the Agriculture Department saying that 
inspectors will now use a new scientific test instead of the old "see, touch, 
smell" method of detecting bacteria in meat: "In a related story, Madonna 
announced that she'll stick with the old method to choose her dates." 
</P>
<P>
 Comic Argus Hamilton, on the refugees at Guantanamo: "The Haitians and the 
Cubans aren't mixing well. Seems the Haitians are very snobbish; they have that 
'we-were-detained-here-first' air of supremacy about them." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, on the crime bill: "Some senators tried unsuccessfully to amend it. 
Republican moderates wanted to keep assault rifles legal, while GOP 
conservatives wanted to make them mandatory." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Tony Peyser, on the couple who won the $8.4-million Georgia 
Lottery while at a family reunion in New Jersey: "This means there was 
virtually no lag time for relatives to start sucking up and asking for loans."

 Jay Leno's entertainment news:

used some of these same stamps to mail the families of these legends some of 
the royalties they have screwed them out of over the years?" 
</P>
<P>
 * On actor Rip Torn suing actor Dennis Hopper over a statement the latter 
recently made about an incident that happened in the 1960s: "In a way, I feel

 Reader John Braislin says that some years ago, he and his son attended a sex 
education program at the local grammar school. Following a presentation on 
venereal diseases, the doctor conducting the program asked if there were any 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 One fifth-grader raised his hand, stood and asked: "If I have a venereal 
disease and I give it to someone else, do I still have it? "

<TEXT>
<P>
 Many situations in life are clear-cut. You know exactly what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's say, for example, you're a professional athlete. Your job, which is 
basically part time, essentially involves a lot of standing around, scratching 
and spitting. For this you are paid, on average, $1.2 million a year. Of 
course, no one should endure such oppressive conditions. You have no choice 
other than to go out on strike. Hardly a tough call. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, say you're the leader of a major world power. Things aren't going all that 
well, though. There's even talk of replacing you with a fellow named Gump. 
Granted, it's probably just the ploy of embittered partisans. But the 
Republicans are rumored to be working on a plan as well. Again, an easy 
decision. With renewed resolve, you plant your feet firmly in, uh, the sand at 
Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, there are many other situations that aren't so black-and-white. 
I found myself in such a circumstance just the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, this situation was black-and-white -- at least the cow was. Here's 
what happened: 
</P>
<P>
 I leave the standard note for the kids -- "Have been abducted by aliens, 
again. Love, Mom" -- and sneak out to the back yard for what I hope will be at 
least three minutes of peace and quiet. So there I am, becoming one with my 
lounge chair, and I see this woman walking what appears to be a rather large 
Holstein. 
</P>
<P>
 No problem, so far. You see, where I live, it's kind of like Venice Beach 
meets the 4-H. It's not at all unusual to see people Rollerblading with their 
goats, jogging with potbellied pigs or babbling incoherently to a gaggle of 
geese. 
</P>
<P>
 So I'm not fazed. But then I see this woman, and her cow, go into a model 
home. You know, the kind they decorate really nicely to distract you from the 
fact that the mortgage will probably bankrupt you, or at best leave you with 
enough money to maybe put a couple of beanbags on layaway. 
</P>
<P>
 My first thought was: I wouldn't really mind being abducted by aliens. Chances 
are it would get me out of making dinner, and I have to think that light-years 
convert to massive frequent-flier miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe they take a few specimens, ask a few questions -- such as: Why is Bruce 
Willis doing nude scenes -- wasn't "Hudson Hawk" embarrassing enough? Is 
"Jurassic Park" out on video yet? And where might we get tickets to see that 
Billy Joel-Elton John concert? 
</P>
<P>
 Geez, I have to learn to focus. Remember: cow, expensive furnishings, nasty 
carpet stains. So what should I do? 
</P>
<P>
 I have to assume it's unwise to start trouble with someone accompanied by a 
thousand-pound pet. For all I know, it could be a trained attack cow. One false 
move and I'm Bossy's in-between-meal snack. 
</P>
<P>
 Or it could be one of those radical farm animals, the kind that will stampede 
your house if they even suspect you own as much as a pair of leather shoelaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, there could be any number of logical explanations. This is the 
country after all. Maybe cattle can become licensed real estate agents. I've 
certainly met plenty who are full of bull . . . well, who were very 
bovine-like. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be that this woman just bought the house and is doing the required 
walk-through accompanied by her keen-eyed, cud-chewing assistant. Or, maybe she 
is considering buying the house and brought along a psychic cow. (Hey, we're 
not that far from L.A.) One moo for "house has good vibes," two moos for "do 
you remember that movie 'Poltergeist?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's equally possible that she's the lunatic leader of the lawless 
Guernsey gang that has been stomping through model homes from here to 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 But who to call? The police? The animal shelter? State board of real estate 
brokers? Jerseymaid? 
</P>
<P>
 After much thought, I did what seems to be the standard 1990s response in such 
should-I-or-should-I-not-get-involved situations. I caught it all on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, where's that number for "Hard Copy"?

RUSSIA'S FAR EAST REPORTEDLY FACING HARVEST DISASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Grain, potato and vegetable crops in the Russian far east are being harvested 
at a disastrously slow pace because of a shortage of fuel and spare parts, 
Itar-Tass news agency said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 198,000 out of 358,000 acres of grain will have been harvested by the end 
of this month, the time when all grain has usually been gathered, the agency 
quoted agricultural officials in Vladivostok as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 "The potato harvest has not yet started. Vegetables are dying in the fields. 
Beans are withering away," the news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers have frequently complained that the government is ignoring the 
crippling financial and technical problems besetting the country's agriculture. 
Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin said Saturday that the state had already 
spent $604 million to help with this year's harvest.

<P>
 Severe flooding in the former Soviet republic of Moldova has killed at least 
50 people and caused massive damage, Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The central part of the republic has already been declared a disaster zone, 
and the death toll appears likely to rise as rescuers reach more villages. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,000 houses were damaged, roads were destroyed, hundreds of cattle 
drowned and crops were ruined in central and southern Moldova as a result of 
heavy rains, Deputy Prime Minister Valeriu Bulgari said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgari estimated the damage at $50 million, the Russian Interfax news agency 
reported.

STORY OF JAIL STAY CALLED KEY TO SITE'S PRESERVATION; OJAI: COUNCIL MEMBERS SAY 
BILL LOTTS' ANECDOTE PROMPTED DECISION TO RENOVATE THE STRUCTURE IN TRIBUTE TO 
ITS HISTORY. THE WORK STARTS NEXT MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON GRANT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When recounting Ojai lore, local residents still talk about Bill Lotts' 
impassioned words to the City Council in 1992 as he stood firmly and demanded 
the preservation of the old city jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm neither a drunkard nor a wife beater, but I once spent a night in the 
Ojai City Jail," Lotts declared, responding to a city official who wanted the 
structure torn down partly because, he said, only drunks and wife beaters ever 
stayed there. 
</P>
<P>
 And council members will tell you today that those 20 words uttered by Lotts 
helped sway their decision to renovate the jail into a historic site for the 
public in Libbey Park, where it was used from the mid-1920s through the early 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Phase 1 of the renovation -- exterior painting, a bench, a sign, lighting 
and landscaping -- is set to start in early September. The City Council and the 
Planning Commission in July and early August approved the specifics of the Ojai 
Historic Preservation Commission's Phase 1 plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The small, white and tattered cement building found down a short walkway from 
the Libbey Bowl will soon get an adobe-colored paint job, a granite sidewalk, a 
plaque on a redwood post, a wooden bench, a steel light fixture and automatic 
floodlights that activate when someone approaches the building at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Lotts said he had read a parks commissioner's comment in a local newspaper to 
the effect that only drunks and wife beaters were imprisoned in the jail, and 
it should be dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
 "That made me angry," he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Lotts said, he knew it was time to speak up and stop officials who 
wanted to place three picnic tables where the jail stood, on the advice of a 
consultant updating Libbey Park's master plan. "I went on to say that I thought 
it was important that the jail be kept, that it was a historic monument to the 
city of Ojai," said Lotts, 70, an electrical contractor and an Ojai resident 
since 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the heated council meeting in 1992, politicians agreed, after a long 
discussion. Mayor Joe DeVito said Lotts' speech influenced the vote to save the 
jail. Lotts "added some zest to the conversation," DeVito said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It did make a difference. Everybody warmed up to the whole issue when Bill 
came forward," recalled Councilwoman Nina V. Shelley. "What we leave and put in 
that park is very carefully decided upon." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley and DeVito said Lotts' whimsical story about a night spent in one of 
the four 6-by-10-foot jail cells in 1955 bolstered the commission's argument 
that the jail had a rich past that should be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of Ojai," DeVito said. "And Ojai feels strongly about retaining its 
past and tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Shelley: "Bill's little story lent a sense of history to the thing." 
</P>
<P>
 At age 32, Lotts and an Ojai policeman were dating the same woman. Lotts had 
gone to her house to ask her to dinner one winter evening, but as she opened 
the door the officer pulled up to her house and told Lotts he had illegally 
parked on her small, dirt road. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got into a heated argument," Lotts said, and the policeman arrested him. 
Lotts couldn't recall the specific charge, but he thought it was either 
resisting arrest or public drunkenness, although he hadn't downed a drop that 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Lotts was stuck for the night in the small, creepy jail in Libbey Park. It sat 
across the street from the police station near the back of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put me in there with flashlights -- it was pitch black," Lotts said. "I 
remember it being cold; I slept with my clothes on. I remember being very 
lonely." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, he said, the charges were dismissed. Lotts thinks the policeman 
didn't show up for the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The chairwoman of the preservation commission, Betty McAllister, says tales 
such as Lotts' make the Ojai jail worth keeping. She said that after the 
renovation her commission plans to showcase the unique features of a shack-like 
city jail, used to house small-time offenders, which was set apart from the 
police station. 
</P>
<P>
 "The original wash basins and toilets are still in the jail," she said, "and 
the walls have graffiti written on them that I'd like to preserve, like words 
from Bob Dylan songs and other writing from inmates in the 1960s like, 'LSD is 
here to stay.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On several walls in the musty jail, graffiti from the '60s and early '70s 
takes visitors back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I Kerry Donat O'Conner hereby cast spells on the both of you," an inmate 
wrote in 1969, referring to police officers. A prisoner named Cain marked off 
his 60-day sentence on another section of the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope people learn the history of the social conditions of the times and how 
they've changed," McAllister said. "You'd never get away with that jail today; 
the Civil Liberties Union would be after you." 
</P>
<P>
 In the decades that the jail was operating, about 600 offenders were sent 
there, McAllister said. Often, two people were crowded into each extremely 
small cell. Lotts recalled that on the night he spent there, he was told there 
was an intercom and microphone connected to the police station in case he fell 
ill or encountered trouble. But he doubts anyone was really listening. 
</P>
<P>
 McAllister said that after the exterior renovations are completed -- she hopes 
by the end of the year -- more money will be raised and plans for the interior 
renovation will be presented to the City Council. She expects the interior work 
to be finished by October, 1995, in time for the next Ojai Day celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary plans for the interior include replacing old bunk beds that once 
hung from chains in the small building -- only 23 feet across, 15 feet wide and 
10 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people think it's a restroom or something," McAllister said, adding that 
the interior renovation will include either bars or a plexiglass wall inside 
the doorway, which will be kept open during daylight hours, so sightseers can 
view the inside on their own.

STREET SMART: CITY PLANS TO PROHIBIT U-TURNS AT NARROW INTERSECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 As an attorney specializing in defending people involved in accidents, I have 
noticed an unsafe intersection in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The danger exists because U-turns are permitted at the intersection of 
Telephone Road and Scandia Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The city allows U-turns at this intersection even though the road is not wide 
enough for many cars to make the turn safely. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers end up running onto the sidewalk, backing up into the intersection or 
swerving onto Scandia, possibly into oncoming traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Once I saw a pedestrian almost get hit by a truck that got stuck at this 
intersection while trying to make a U-turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, U-turns must be prohibited at this intersection to prevent a serious 
if not fatal accident from occurring. 
</P>
<P>
 I reported this situation to the city several months ago, and no action was 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
 I am sure the interested insurer for the city would be rather disturbed at the 
city's gross neglect at not correcting an obviously very dangerous condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Such neglect could expose the city to significant liability if an accident 
were to occur at this intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 James G. Connery, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Such "neglect" will soon end, as the city has promised to ban U-turns there. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to your complaint, city traffic workers trundled over to Scandia 
and Telephone and measured the turning arc at the intersection, traffic 
engineer Nazir Lalani says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lo and behold, they found that it was something of a squeeze for a passenger 
vehicle and nearly impossible for a delivery truck to make the turn without 
endangering life, limb and sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for prominent "No U-Turn" signs within the next month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 As a Westlake Village resident who lives near the Hampshire Road off-ramp of 
the Ventura Freeway, I'm worried about the impact of traffic when the Civic 
Arts Plaza opens next month. 
</P>
<P>
 I noted that there are signs in both directions on the freeway directing 
people to the Hampshire off-ramp, a one-lane exit. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now traffic tends to get backed up at this exit. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone needs to address the question of whether or not the exit can be 
widened to two lanes to avoid extremely long lines of vehicles on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Has the city of Thousand Oaks, the county or the state made plans to improve 
this exit? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't get me wrong, I really am excited about the new facility and plan to 
attend as many events as my budget allows. But this situation is a crisis 
waiting to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope someone besides me is thinking about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon L. McBride, Westlake Village 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 You are not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Many, many city leaders and traffic types have been puzzling over the very 
problem you write about, says Thousand Oaks traffic engineer John Helliwell. 
</P>
<P>
 Hampshire Road near the Ventura Freeway is already one of the most congested 
roadways in the city, Helliwell says. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution? 
</P>
<P>
 A $1.2-million road-widening project, funded 80% with federal highway dollars 
and 20% by the city of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, scheduled for completion within the next year, includes widening 
Hampshire Road and installing turning lanes and pedestrian and bike paths. 
</P>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter that appeared Aug. 8, Mr. Paul Hill of Ventura wrote that he is 
fed up with trying to turn left from eastbound Telegraph Road to southbound 
Victoria Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I am 11 years old and won't be able to drive for five years. But in 
thinking it over, I think Mr. Hill has identified a problem that is not likely 
ever to be solved. 
</P>
<P>
 As I see it, it would not just be difficult to turn left from eastbound 
Telegraph to southbound Victoria -- it would be impossible! 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin C. Olesky, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Right you are. 
</P>
<P>
 And right is the key word here. 
</P>
<P>
 It would indeed be impossible to turn left from eastbound Telegraph to 
southbound Victoria. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Hill's frustration actually concerned a problem that does exist: the 
difficulty of turning right from eastbound Telegraph to southbound Victoria.

FINDING A FORMULA FOR A CLEAN LAKE; WESTLAKE: CARETAKERS OF TRANQUIL 
RESIDENTIAL WATERWAY STRUGGLE TO KEEP ALGAE AND EVAPORATION IN CHECK. A THIRD 
WELL MAY BE NEEDED, THEY SAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Westlake Village resident Ben Schulman constantly tinkers with the formula for 
serenity on Westlake Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Kill too much algae and light will cause weeds on the lake floor to sprout as 
much as six inches a day. Let the algae grow, and within days a green carpet 
will grow thick enough to prevent a duck from getting its feet wet crossing the 
lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got some very difficult problems to deal with, both technically and 
financially," explained Schulman, president of the Westlake Lake Property Assn. 
"And we're devoting almost all of our time to solving them." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the ever-regenerating algae, Schulman said the artificial 
lake's engineers have struggled daily to keep it full, despite losing up to 
1,000 gallons each minute to evaporation in the summer heat. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Schulman said, they have been able to refill the lake fast enough to 
conceal the problem from the nearly 1,200 residents who gaze out at it every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 The 150-acre lake, which straddles the border between Ventura and Los Angeles 
counties, remains a scene of tranquillity, where it is common to spy a blue 
heron in flight or a sailboat gliding gently along in the breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents such as William Murphy say the beauty of the lake is a cure for the 
discomfort of summer swelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "In front of my house it may be summer, but in back of my house it's always 
fall," he said, the water lapping up against his deck. "You always feel a 
little bit cooler when you're looking out at the lake." 
</P>
<P>
 It has not, however, been a summer of calm for Schulman. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, the water that fills the lake comes from the drainage of ground 
water in 18 square miles surrounding the lake. When the runoff is slow, 
engineers compensate by tapping into two wells that collect water from an 
aquifer. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy rainfall two years ago provided enough runoff to keep the lake full for 
the entire summer, and the wells didn't operate all season. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the wells began pumping during the first week in June and have not 
stopped. Even with water from the aquifer, the pumps are barely keeping pace. 
</P>
<P>
 The lake loses water in three ways: Evaporation, if unchecked, will drop the 
lake's surface five feet during the hottest summer months. Neighboring Westlake 
Golf Course, by virtue of a 30-year-old agreement, siphons off as much as 400 
gallons a minute to irrigate its greens. 
</P>
<P>
 And each day, a smaller amount is pushed over a 450-foot-long dam at the east 
end of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep up with the water loss, Schulman and members of the lake's water 
management committee have begun to talk about building a third well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to improve the efficiency of the two wells we've got, to get it 
to pull more water from the aquifer," Schulman said. "But now we have to 
consider a third well, which is a pretty expensive proposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Money for such a project would come from the yearly dues that residents around 
the lake are assessed. Schulman declined to say how much residents pay for lake 
upkeep. "You get what you pay for, and this is a beautiful lake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Few realize the effort it takes to keep the lake beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't know that much about the maintenance of the lake," said Irving 
Wasserman, who lives on the island in the middle of the water. "I see them out 
there chopping away at the algae all the time, but that's about all." 
</P>
<P>
 Algae, Schulman's other main concern, is a problem at many lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year on Lake Sherwood, algae grew with abandon. Dead layers of the 
brownish-green plant filled the air with an odor described by residents as 
"sewage-like." 
</P>
<P>
 On Westlake Lake, William Murphy said, the plant has at times grown so thick 
that residents have had a hard time maneuvering boats through it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially in the summer, it grows like crazy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crosby Fentress, chairman of the property association's water management 
committee, explained that the algae feeds on dead weeds that have accumulated 
at the bottom in layers as thick as two feet. 
</P>
<P>
 And, he said, the reclaimed water frequently used to irrigate nearby 
neighborhoods drains into the lake. That water's nutrients help the algae grow 
even faster. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't eliminate it 100%," Fentress said. "You just have to try to keep it 
under control." 
</P>
<P>
 To do that, the property association purchased a $45,000 harvester machine, 
which chops the algae and sucks it off the surface of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Schulman said, the caretakers use chemicals in small doses to address 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the lake was new, they used enough chemicals to keep it like a swimming 
pool," Schulman said. "But they learned that if the lake surface was too clear, 
the light would speed up the growth of weeds at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a no-win situation," he said. "So now we steer away from using a lot 
of chemicals." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Hanson, who for many years worked as the lake's engineer, called lake 
management a balancing act. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, it's a scientific process," said Hanson, a chemical engineer. "If you 
manage it well, you end up with something really terrific." Lake Woes 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake Lake, which straddles the border between L.A. and Ventura counties, 
is facing summertime woes: an ever-regenerating carpet of algae and rapid 
evaporation, which leads to a struggle to keep the man-made lake full.

GROUP GETS DOWN TO BUSINESS; JOBS: ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ASSN.'S CLOUT GROWS AS 
REVITALIZATION PROGRAM MAKES HEADWAY. COUNTY BACKS ITS CLEAN-AIR PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After years of working as an obscure organization known predominantly to 
business and industry, the Ventura County Economic Development Assn. is finding 
new clout in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 During the booming economy of the 1980s, the association, made up of ranchers 
and business leaders, had no pressing issues on their agenda in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, during the lingering recession, the group has taken an increasingly 
active role in revitalizing the local economy -- a move that leaders hope will 
save jobs and bring new business to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Their role was evident last week when the association, working with a 
county-appointed panel and local pollution regulators, won the Board of 
Supervisors' approval for a clean-air plan that would replace parts of a 
federal proposal considered too harsh on business. 
</P>
<P>
 The spirit of cooperation that developed between the private sector and county 
regulators has laid the foundation for the association's ambitious goals for 
the coming year, said Carolyn Leavens, the group's newly elected president. 
</P>
<P>
 Those goals include attracting firms to the county by creating a more 
business-friendly environment, streamlining county regulations to allow 
"one-stop shopping" for new and expanding businesses and developing an economic 
profile of the county to entice new companies that may consider relocating. 
</P>
<P>
 The association will continue its work on the air-quality plan as well as an 
educational program to help teach high school seniors who don't want to go to 
college how to prepare for the work force. It will also take an active role in 
working for a regional airport and against military base closures. 
</P>
<P>
 But the organization has one overriding goal, Leavens said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to stop the job drain in Ventura County," said the president, whose 
family citrus-and-avocado business is one of the largest in the county. "We've 
got to have regulators working with the private sector to give business a leg 
up. We're world marketers, and we have to be competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 The county has lost 12,000 jobs in the past five years, and it faces the 
possibility of further losses if either of the U.S. Navy bases at Point Mugu or 
Port Hueneme cuts back or closes, association officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Sears, a consultant for the Environmental Coalition and the Citizens to 
Preserve the Ojai, praised the group's efforts to protect the local economy, 
but he said the association's alternative clean-air proposal will not cut 
pollution enough to meet federal health standards. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he said, it's questionable whether the U. S. Environmental Protection 
Agency's own plan is tough enough to meet those standards. By federal court 
order, the EPA must have a plan to reduce pollution enough to meet the 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The VCEDA alternative plan, which is less stringent than the EPA plan, will 
leave us even further from attainment (of the standards)," Sears said. "The 
effect of the VCEDA plan has not been tested." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever final plan the EPA adopts in February, County Supervisor Maggie 
Kildee said, it must have input from all sectors of the community to succeed. 
That cooperation must continue in the future to keep the economy healthy, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes government working with business to make sure that government is as 
receptive as we can be," Kildee said. "With the economy turning down, everyone 
has been focusing more on business." 
</P>
<P>
 The group began as the county-funded Ventura County Chamber of Commerce in 
1949, said Nancy Williams, one of the association's two paid staff members. Its 
name was changed to the Ventura County Economic Development Assn. in 1959. 
Funding from the county continued until 1972, when directors opted for more 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization relies on a cadre of about 200 volunteers, including its 
30-member board of directors, to carry out most of its projects. Membership 
dues, which range from $150 to $1,000 depending on the size of the company, 
account for most of the $200,000 annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Two fund-raisers and an annual economic outlook conference make up the 
difference most years. 
</P>
<P>
 During the boom years in California and the county, the association's task was 
simple, said 18-year board member Oras Racicot, regional affairs manager for 
Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time, the economy wasn't an issue here," he said. "We would just 
go along and get increases (in funding) every year. But when the economy went 
sour and we saw jobs leaving the community, things changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Directors formed what they called the Red Team last spring to try to lure a 
new Mercedes-Benz plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went in knowing the chances were remote," Racicot said, and the plan was 
unsuccessful. "But it brought together a nice coalition of people interested in 
the Ventura County economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last February, when the EPA released its proposed Federal Implementation 
Plan to clean up the county's air, the association realized that it held 
tremendous implications for business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal plan, developed under court order, would force annual emissions 
reductions from industry. But some companies that already have cut back on 
emissions as much as technology allows would be forced to cut back production 
to meet those requirements, business representatives and regulators say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were at the point where stationary sources of emissions couldn't be 
squeezed any more because we would lose productivity if the (federal plan) was 
imposed," he said. "This really brought VCEDA together and gave us a focus," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Mount, deputy director of the Air Pollution Control District, has praised 
the association and the Council on Economic Vitality for their work to develop 
an alternative clean-air plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been devastating to industry," said Mount, whose staff provided 
technical assistance to the two groups in developing their plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The association will continue to work with the air-pollution district to 
develop new regulations and will lobby the state to adopt a strict new 
smog-check program that would reduce emissions from motor vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The association also plans to lobby the state Legislature to enact a law that 
would charge motorists an annual fee based on how much they drive and how much 
their cars pollute. 
</P>
<P>
 But association directors also see more issues on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposed county traffic fees to improve roads are an example of a new rule 
that could prove very unfavorable for business, said Richard Spencer, executive 
vice president of Martin V. Smith & Associates and a new association board 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cities already have traffic mitigation fees in place, and these county 
fees will not replace those," he said. "They will be stacked on top." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the answer is to attract enough jobs to the county so that the fees 
aren't necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had enough businesses here producing things, and if there were enough 
taxes from people working flowing into county government as there used to be, 
we would not need traffic mitigation fees," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But until then, Kildee said, some fees are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the Board of Supervisors will say: 'You don't like the fees, so 
you don't have to have them,' " she said. "But I don't think the board will 
just say: 'That's tough,' either. I think there will be a compromise so that 
everybody will get a little bit and nobody will be totally hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Leavens said the details have yet to be worked out for how the new spirit of 
cooperation will translate into a friendlier environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "But," she said, "it will have to be an alliance."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; HOUSING ALLOCATIONS EXPECTED TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura home builders and preservationists should receive word today on who 
gets to build new houses in the city and when. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members had hoped to dole out housing allocations in July, but 
their meeting went too long. At 2 a.m., they decided to postpone the issue 
until they had returned from their August break this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Bound by the restrictions of its own Comprehensive Plan, the city can allow 
only about 1,000 housing units to be built between now and 1999. But developers 
have submitted requests to construct nearly three times that amount in the next 
few years alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the projects have raised considerable controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 One is a proposal by developer Ron Hertel to build 437 houses on what is now a 
city-owned lemon orchard. To obtain the allocations and ownership of the 
orchard, he proposes that the city swap its 87 acres at Telegraph Road and 
Petit Avenue for his 94 acres at Telephone and Kimball roads. He says he will 
throw $2 million into the bargain for construction of a regional park on his 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 His proposal carries the enthusiastic backing of eastside sports organizers 
and coaches. But preservationists and neighbors of the proposed development 
oppose the project because they want to keep the lemon orchard agricultural 
until the year 2010, as it is now designated in Ventura's Comprehensive Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The other controversial proposal comes from the Neel family, an old Ventura 
farming family that wants to build 120 homes on a 22-acre parcel just west of 
Ventura Avenue. Some members of the council have enthusiastically supported the 
project, calling it a private redevelopment opportunity for the beleaguered 
Avenue neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 But a cluster of small business owners around the property oppose the 
development. They say neighbors would object to their heavily industrial 
businesses and would try to run them out of the area. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; 2 DIE, SEVERAL HURT IN AUTO ACCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two motorists died Sunday in separate automobile accidents, county authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first incident, an 18-year-old Oxnard man died at about 6:45 a.m. after 
the car in which he was riding collided with another automobile near the 
intersection of Pleasant Valley and Hailes roads, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel Perez died at the scene following the 6 a.m. accident in unincorporated 
area of the county near Oxnard, said Deputy Coroner Craig Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens said that several people in both cars were injured when the two cars 
collided, but their conditions were not released. None of the motorists were 
wearing seat belts, Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second fatality occurred about 10 hours later on California 126 at Briggs 
Road near Santa Paula around 5 p.m., according to the California Highway 
Patrol. But the CHP had no details or names. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE CASITAS; BIKERS RAISE $17,000 FOR KIDS NEEDING 
ORGANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Replete with roaring "hogs," shiny buckles and black leather chaps, an 
estimated 1,300 motorcyclists rode from Newhall to Lake Casitas Sunday to raise 
funds for a children's organ transplant charity. 
</P>
<P>
 The second annual "Ride for Life" covered a 70-mile trek from a Newhall-area 
motorcycle shop to the Ventura County lake, where they finished the ride with a 
picnic and outdoor concert. The event netted an estimated $17,000 for the 
nonprofit World Children's Transplant Fund, according to Mark A. Kroeker, the 
organization's founder. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been astounded by the turn-out," said Kroeker, a deputy chief for the 
Los Angeles Police Department. "It's very gratifying to see all these people 
come out and spend the day with us. It says that we're getting our message 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Participants in Sunday's event paid $30 each to participate in the ride and 
then enjoy lunch and a short concert at the lake afterward. Some supporters 
ride along in their cars; others simply join up at the lake for the food and 
concert. Actor Lorenzo Lamas, star of the television show "Renegade," led the 
bikers during the ride and served as host for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was touched by the outpouring of support we've had today," he said. "It 
warmed my heart to see so many people give up one of their hard-earned days off 
to join us." 
</P>
<P>
 For Yvonne Tello of Oak View, the event was the perfect chance to enjoy the 
sun, listen to music and enjoy a picnic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came out for this last year -- the kids really love the bikes," said 
Tello, 33. "My husband and I enjoy the day and it's all for a great cause." 
</P>
<P>
 The fund helps arrange for and subsidize organ transplants for children in the 
United States and around the world. Kroeker founded the organization after a 
1987 trip to Argentina during which he met a 12-year-old girl in need of a 
liver transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since that time, I would guess that we have been involved in making several 
hundred transplants happen since then. The work we're doing is very satisfying 
because it's giving kids a second chance." J.E. MITCHELL

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK, THOUSAND OAKS; RING SUSPECTED IN THEFTS OF 
CIGARETTES 
</P>

<P>
 Nighttime thieves who slip in through the rooftops of liquor stores to help 
themselves to cartons of cigarettes have been victimizing shopkeepers from 
Moorpark to perhaps as far away as Glendale, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 In at least one of the thefts, lawmen have narrowed their focus to four men 
who were captured Aug. 19 on a store videotape as they appeared to be casing 
Moorpark Liquors at 312 W. Los Angeles Ave., said Sgt. Terry Hughes of the 
Ventura County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, employees discovered an estimated $7,800 worth of cigarettes was 
missing, along with some cash and some X-rated videos, Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the store videotape, the suspects could be heard "making reference to 
cigarettes," he said. "If you saw the tape, I think you'd see it's pretty 
obvious they were casing the place." 
</P>
<P>
 In another incident, thieves took an estimated $21,000 worth of cigarettes on 
Aug. 9 from the Spirit Shoppe at 339 Hampshire Road in Thousand Oaks, Hughes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said another $22,000 worth of cigarettes was taken from the Liquor Chest in 
Agoura Hills, also on the night of Aug. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has yet to directly link the Ventura County thefts to any others, 
Hughes said it might just be a matter of time. 
</P>
<P>
 According to what shopkeepers have told him, similar burglaries have been 
reported at liquor stores in Encino, Granada Hills and Glendale, all since the 
beginning of August. 
</P>
<P>
 "All indications are that there are a multitude of victims in the greater Los 
Angeles area," Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he has shared information with police and sheriff's deputies in 
both Los Angeles and Ventura counties. GREG RIPPEE

FIGHT ALLEGEDLY ESCALATES TO ATTEMPTED MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A fistfight between two men outside a Ventura convenience store escalated to 
attempted murder early Sunday when one of the men pulled a gun and fired 
several shots as he chased the other man for several blocks, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the incident outside the Circle K store at 1007 E. Main 
St. just after midnight, Ventura police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Joseph Michael Ransome, 26, and Anthony Pech, 23, fought outside 
the market. But when Pech began to lose the fistfight, he pulled out a handgun 
and began chasing Ransome, according to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Ransome avoided at least three rounds, including one bullet that struck a 
cinder-block wall just above his head, showering him in concrete fragments, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Accounts from witnesses led police to a nearby residence. The handgun 
allegedly used by Pech was found in a patch of shrubbery near the house, police 
said. It had been reported stolen to the Port Hueneme Police Department earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Pech on suspicion of attempted murder and possession of stolen 
property, officials said. He was being held at Ventura County Jail in lieu of 
$250,000 bail and is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FIRE STATIONS HIT BY RASH OF BURGLARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Detective Stan Weber had long marveled at how firefighters could leave their 
stations unlocked and their garage doors wide open without being burglarized 
while on a call. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always amazed seeing fire stations open and no one bothers (to break 
in)," said the detective, who has been with the Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Those days, apparently, are over. 
</P>
<P>
 For several months, county deputies and fire officials have been mystified by 
a rash of petty burglaries at stations in Santa Paula, Moorpark, Simi Valley, 
Thousand Oaks and Newbury Park. All occurred while firefighters were out on 
calls, several of them false alarms and at least two involving bogus reports of 
motorcycle accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 At least nine stations -- and probably more -- have been hit, Weber said, some 
more than once. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Assistant Fire Chief Dave Festerling said the total from all 
the thefts is not large -- in excess of $1,000 -- and that the bulk were from 
firefighters' petty cash for groceries. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials are concerned, so much so that security measures have been 
stiffened, from assuring that stations are locked up when their crews leave to 
changing the push-button access codes that some stations use to unlock doors, 
Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Station 34 at 555 Avenida de los Arboles in Thousand Oaks was hit on May 
19, after firefighters received a call that a motorcyclist was injured, the 
detective said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the 911 call came at about 12:40 a.m. and firefighters returned to the 
station 20 minutes later, at 1 a.m., only to find that someone had purloined 
their cable TV box and about $140 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters never found the reported accident. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 10, a similar burglary occurred at Fire Station 31 in Thousand Oaks 
after a false 911 report of a motorcycle accident was called in, Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't ever remember a fire station being broken into," Weber said. "I 
always thought fire stations were pretty safe. People respect them." GREG

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; SPARK OF LIFE IN BID TO KEEP THE RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who knows what will happen in the negotiations between the Rams and a task 
force called Save the Rams, which is trying to keep the football team in Orange 
County? The encouraging thing for now is to see some passion about the fortunes 
of a team that has tested fans' patience on the field and that seemed destined 
to go packing. 
</P>
<P>
 There still is a very strong possibility that the Rams will move elsewhere, 
but it would be terrific for the region if the team could be given an 
inspirational lift by the community and be lured into a fresh commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be especially good if this could be done in a manner that retains the 
Rams without giving away the store. And since having a football team is not 
just about a seasonal boost for the economy but also about community pride and 
identity, why not build a franchise that can bring a few more victories to the 
loyal and long-suffering fans of Southern California? 
</P>
<P>
 The determined local business people and elected officials in Save the Rams 
are at least trying to make some of those things happen. They presented the 
team last week with a proposal that included remodeling Anaheim Stadium, 
building a new office complex and practice facility, and $50 million from local 
investors to purchase part of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit Newport Beach sports attorney Leigh Steinberg and his band of 
enthusiasts with establishing a constructive negotiating climate and for trying 
to stem the tide before the team is lured away by suitors in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Rams, owner Georgia Frontiere said she wanted Orange County to 
build her a new stadium, a scenario decidedly not in the group's plans, and 
that she was not sanguine about reaching an agreement although the door was 
ajar. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be. However, these are negotiations, and negotiations ultimately are 
about give and take. Keep in mind that Frontiere has been adamant about 
retaining a majority interest and that negotiations in Baltimore broke off over 
the expressed wish of Peter Angelos, managing partner of the Baltimore Orioles, 
to eventually have majority ownership of the Rams. The Orange County group of 
high-rolling investors is talking about a minority interest for which they 
would kick in a cool $5 million each. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, the outlook for retention may not be encouraging, but it is 
heartening to see a local group mount a campaign to retain an organization that 
really should remain a Southern California institution.

FRESNO, OHIO ST. TAKE EARLY LOOK; PIGSKIN CLASSIC: THE TEAMS MEET AT ANAHEIM 
STADIUM EAGER FOR INDICATION OF WHAT THEIR SEASONS WILL HOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fresno State Coach Jim Sweeney is eager to get a look at his new quarterback, 
and to find out what life might be like this season without Trent Dilfer. 
</P>
<P>
 And Ohio State Coach John Cooper is a bit anxious about how some newcomers in 
his lineup will measure up even though the Buckeyes return nine starters from a 
team that shared the Big Ten championship a year ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Both will have a much better reading about where their teams might be headed 
in the new college football season after tonight's Disneyland Pigskin Classic 
in Anaheim Stadium. Game time is 6 p.m., with a crowd of about 30,000 expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State last visited Anaheim Stadium on Dec. 29, 1992, for the Freedom 
Bowl and knocked off USC, 24-7, before 58,546. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State and Ohio State have been among the most successful in the nation 
in the '90s. Fresno State is 35-12-1 (.740) in the past three seasons; Ohio 
State is 33-12-3 (.719). 
</P>
<P>
 Adrian Claiborne, a sophomore from Riverside, will take over at quarterback as 
the replacement for Dilfer, who passed up his senior season at Fresno and was a 
first-round NFL draft pick by Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really excited, getting to play Ohio State on national television in the 
first game of the season," said Claiborne, who threw only nine passes in four 
appearances a year ago as Dilfer's backup. Sweeney can't avoid the inevitable 
comparisons between Dilfer and Claiborne. "We don't want to put a lot of 
pressure on Adrian," Sweeney said. "He's a great athlete, but he doesn't have 
to fill Dilfer's shoes. I tell him he doesn't have to be a magician. He just 
has to fill his own shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has great mobility, and he has that ability to drop back and move with the 
football. (Roger) Staubach had that special kind of escape ability. Adrian has 
that kind of elusiveness as a quarterback. In a scrimmage the other night, it 
was very hard for our defense to contain him." One big advantage for Claiborne 
is the talented and experienced corps of receivers, led by flanker Charlie 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlie is our big-play guy, but we've got four receivers who are as good as 
we've had," Sweeney said. "We've got some outstanding speed in that group of 
players."  
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State, ranked 20th in the Associated Press preseason poll, is expected to 
be strong defensively with a particularly formidable group of linebackers. 
Lorenzo Styles, an all-Big Ten selection last season, led the team in tackles 
last season with 117.  
</P>
<P>
 "I expect them to really come at me," Claiborne said. "We've been working a 
lot on handling the blitz." 
</P>
<P>
 The Buckeyes, however, were left with a huge hole at defensive tackle when Dan 
Wilkinson passed up his final year of eligibility and was the first player 
picked in the draft. Ohio State has only one returning regular in the 
secondary, cornerback Marlon Kerner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll definitely be tested in the secondary with the new quarterback and 
those great wide receivers," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper thinks the early game will help him get a good indication of this 
team's strengths and weaknesses. "We'll be playing more new players than any 
time since my first year at Ohio State," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State returns quarterback Bobby Hoying, who passed for 1,570 yards and 16 
touchdowns a year ago. His favorite receiver is split end Joey Galloway.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; FORMER CHARGER TIGHT END TO GET TRYOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Rams were awaiting the arrival of former Charger tight end Derrick Walker 
Sunday night for a tryout, but unless Walker puts on a show, the team is 
expected to sign former Washington tight end Ron Middleton today. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams sign Middleton, tight end Travis McNeal, who received permission 
Sunday to attend to an illness in his family, is considered the logical choice 
to be released. 
</P>
<P>
 Middleton (6-2, 262) worked primarily as a blocking tight end while with 
Washington, and will fill the void left by Pat Carter's defection during the 
off-season to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tight end Rickey Brady, wide receiver Jermaine Ross, offensive tackle Ron 
Edwards and defensive lineman Kevin Patrick are expected to be signed this week 
to the Rams' practice squad. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Starting defensive tackle Jimmie Jones received permission to miss Sunday's 
practice to attend to personal business. Coach Chuck Knox said he expects Jones 
to return today. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago Keith Loneker was just thrilled to still be on the roster at the 
final cut. Sunday, he not only remained on the roster, but worked as the team's 
starting left guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just going through the motions early on in camp," Loneker said. "Then 
old-man (Jackie) Slater pulled me aside, sat me down and told me I was joking 
around too much. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he doesn't talk to me like that, I'm probably not sitting here today." 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Ashmore worked as starting right tackle in place of Slater, but Knox 
said, "that isn't etched in stone at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After Sunday's cuts, eight of the 23 players drafted in 1992-93 remain with 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven of the 10 drafted players selected in 1994 made the 53-man roster, but 
despite the team's lowly finish the past four years, only second-round pick 
wide receiver Isaac Bruce appears to have a chance to start on opening day.

BIRDIE STRING ONLY PART OF THIS COMEBACK STORY; LPGA: NAUSE, BARELY ABLE TO 
WALK LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF ILLNESS, SCORES FIRST VICTORY SINCE 1991.

 Martha Nause, stricken with a severe infection last year that left her barely 
able to walk, birdied four of the last seven holes Sunday to win the du Maurier 
Classic for her first major LPGA title. 
</P>
<P>
 On a rainy, windy day, Nause closed with a one-under 71 for a four-round total 
of nine-under 279. She finished a stroke ahead of her playing partner, Michelle 
McGann. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the greatest," Nause said. "This is so cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Betsy King, one tournament victory from entering the LPGA Hall of Fame, will 
have to wait a little longer. She was two strokes off the lead entering the 
final round, but had an erratic round with six bogies and five birdies. She 
finished with a 73 for a 283. 
</P>
<P>
 Nause's winning push came after an 85-minute thunderstorm delay on the Ottawa 
Hunt and Golf Club course. 
</P>
<P>
 Her victory also follows a yearlong rehabilitation from an illness that almost 
ended her career. She spent much of 1993 recovering from an infection that 
caused severe nerve damage in her ear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to hold on to things to walk, I couldn't drive a car at all," she said. 
"My doctor told me to consider never playing again. He was wrong. I'm just 
finally realizing I've got everything I need to be a winner." 
</P>
<P>
 Nause, 39, of Sheboygan, Wis., is the oldest tour winner this year. She won 
$120,000, almost tripling her tour earnings for this season and pushing her 
over $1 million for her career. She had just two tour victories before Sunday, 
the previous one coming in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Nause made the turn one under and bogeyed the 10th hole. But she birdied Nos. 
11, 13, 14 and 15 to take a two-stroke lead on McGann. Nause bogeyed the 
par-three 17th but parred the 18th. 
</P>
<P>
 The course yielded record-low scores four days ago, but Sunday proved more 
vexing with intermittent rain squalls, swirling winds and encroaching thunder. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, 12 golfers shot 68 or better and 56 shot par or better -- the 
previous course record for women. Nause managed to tie the men's course record 
of 65, last matched in 1960 by Jack Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
 But among Saturday's top 10 leaders, only Nause broke par Sunday as weather 
conditions made the final round a battle of survival.

GOLF ROUNDUP; ONE-STROKE VICTORY NETS OLAZABAL $360,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain won the World Series of Golf on Sunday at Akron, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Olazabal, who won the Masters in April, joined Nick Price of Zimbabwe as the 
only multiple winners on the American tour this year with a one-stroke victory 
over a field of most of the best players in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 He won it with a final round 67, including a critical save of par on the final 
hole, to earn $360,000 from the purse of $2 million and push his earnings to 
$969,900 in only eight U.S. starts this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Olazabal, a runaway record-setting winner of this title in 1990, came from 
three shots off the pace this time and said it might have been the more 
pleasing victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very tough conditions today," Olazabal said of the showery, windy weather. 
</P>
<P>
 This one came on a 269 total, 11-under par. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Hoch, who missed a birdie putt of less than two feet on the 17th hole, 
birdied the last from about six feet to match par 70 and take second alone at 
270. That finish provided him with a place on the United States' inaugural 
President's Cup team that will play an international team next month at Lake 
Manassas, Va. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Tom Weiskopf, who considered withdrawing from the Franklin Quest Championship 
after the death of friend Bert Yancey, beat Dave Stockton in a playoff to win 
the event at Park City, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiskopf shot a final-round 69 to overtake Stockton, who finished with a 70, 
before making a 25-foot birdie putt on the first playoff hole to win his first 
Senior PGA Tour event. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means so much to me to win this trophy for Bert," Weiskopf said. "Wherever 
you are, guy, thank you. I love you." 
</P>
<P>
 In dedicating the victory to Yancey, Weiskopf said he would have his friend's 
name added to his own when the trophy is engraved. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiskopf chased down Stockton with birdies on the last three holes of 
regulation to finish at 12-under 204. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiskopf said he decided to remain in the tournament because Yancey, who died 
Friday of a heart attack, would have wanted him to try to win the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 But those comments varied from statements Weiskopf made Friday after learning 
of Yancey's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "My golf game is not important right now," the distraught Weiskopf had said. 
"I don't know whether I'm going to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiskopf was just as somber on Sunday despite the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We traveled together for 15 years," he said of Yancey. "This is going to be 
difficult for me not having Bert here. I loved him. I won this tournament 
because of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't win this thing. Bert made me win this. If you want to talk about 
destiny, the last three holes would have to be it."

UNLIKELY HERO LEADS SPLASH TO DIVISION TITLE; SOCCER: BRUCH, COACH OF THE 
MARINA HIGH GIRLS' TEAM, GETS IN THE GAME, THEN SCORES WINNER IN OVERTIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The lineup, the coach confessed, was a crapshoot, an appropriate analogy given 
the Splash's 3:30 a.m. arrival -- by bus -- from Las Vegas Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 16 hours later, after sleeping nine of the last 11 days on the East 
Coast, the Splash stepped onto the floor at The Pond of Anaheim worn out and 
beat up, and down four starters. 
</P>
<P>
 "You take the good with the bad," Splash Coach George Fernandez said, "and 
turn it into better." 
</P>
<P>
 So it was under that adversity that the Splash franchise completed a 
worst-to-first journey, going from the Continental Indoor Soccer League's most 
inept team to the Western Division championship Sunday with a 7-6 overtime 
victory over Sacramento in front of 3,837. 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances gave rise to Bobby Bruch, the team's most unlikely hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruch, the Marina High girls' soccer coach who has been nothing more than a 
practice player, wore the Splash uniform for the first time outside of posing 
for the team picture. But after Dale Ervine's shot was blocked by Sacramento 
goalie Mike Dowler, Bruch headed the ball into the net 4:20 into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the greatest feelings in sports," said Bruch, who also had an 
assist. "We work, sweat and fight, and it comes down to the situation it does, 
and it's great to be in the right spot at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a huge moment. Phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruch never broke stride, jumped the dasher boards and landed in the arms of 
Fernandez with a bear hug.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was just overcome," Fernandez said. "The guy's got a great attitude, he's 
positive and full of life and I think it was a case where he thought, 'I 
finally got to play and I scored the biggest goal of my career.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash (19-7) will be host to the playoffs through the semifinals; if they 
were to begin today, the Splash would play Sacramento. The playoffs begin Sept. 
10. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash plays host to Dallas (22-3) on Thursday in what could be a preview 
of the CISL championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento (14-12) could have clinched the final Western Division playoff spot 
with a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash played without defenders Ralph Black and Denis Hamlett and backup 
goalie Ruben Fernandez -- suspended for their part in a brawl in Sacramento on 
Aug. 14. They were also without defender Paul McDonnell, who has an ankle 
injuryand leading point-scorer Raffaele Ruotolo, who has a sprained toe. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, Rod Castro played despite a hyperextended knee suffered in 
Saturday's loss to Las Vegas, though he moved from forward to defender. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, only six of the Splash's top 14 point-scorers were 100%, and the team 
played without four of the top nine. 
</P>
<P>
 "(This victory) makes it a little more special because of what everyone 
overcame," said Ervine, who had two goals and four assists. "Winning the 
division was the first goal, but it's not the only goal." 
</P>
<P>
 The game might not have gone into overtime had it not been for the performance 
of goalkeeper Jorge Valenzuela, who finished with 15 saves -- including seven 
that required more than a little effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Valdivia scored twice, and Doug Neely and Juan Carlos Sanchez also 
scored.

MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK / CHRIS FOSTER: PITCHING CHANGE HAS BEEN STEPHENSON'S 
TICKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Stephenson's pitching career is rolling these days. He's certainly 
proven he can play in Peoria. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephenson, a second-round draft pick of the Chicago Cubs in June, is tearing 
up the Midwest League with Peoria. He has a 3-0 record and 2.23 earned-run 
average in five starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a guy whose pitching career began with a little white lie. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephenson, who played at Fullerton High School, is the son of Dodger scout 
Jerry Stephenson, who played for the Seattle Pilots, Boston Red Sox and 
Dodgers. When dad was looking for a summer league team for his son in 1992, he 
called old friend and former teammate Bill Sudakis, who was running a team in 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephenson was a catcher at UC Santa Barbara. Sudakis had a catcher. 
Stephenson had played shortstop at Fullerton. Sudakis had three shortstops. 
</P>
<P>
 So the conversation went something like, "So what do you need old pal."  
</P>
<P>
 Pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad said, 'Oh, Brian, he's a pitcher,' " Stephenson said. "It took off 
from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Stephenson, an unwanted shortstop from Fullerton, has certainly 
benefited from the change. Just check out the Midwest League these days. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief, somewhat rocky stint in Williamsport, Stephenson was shipped to 
Peoria, a Class-A team. He came out and struck out the side in his first start. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephenson went seven shutout innings, striking out seven, that night. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a relief," Stephenson said. "I had been on a pitch-count in 
Williamsport, so it was hard to get a rhythm. I was getting a little worried, 
but it all worked out." 
</P>
<P>
 It always seems to with Stephenson. 
</P>
<P>
 He decided to walk on at Santa Barbara as a catcher. Stephenson was told he 
would have to redshirt in 1992, which meant he could suit up for games. 
</P>
<P>
 So to stay active, he volunteered to pitch batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was making people look bad, so my dad started thinking maybe I should be a 
pitcher," Stephenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Jerry Stephenson's dad is paid to evaluate talent, even when he's 
related to the player. The phone call to Sudakis just cinched it. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephenson returned to Santa Barbara as a pitcher. He developed into a closer, 
going 5-4 with four saves. But not everything was so bright in his new career. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara began hedging on a scholarship promise, according to Stephenson. 
He went looking for another school. UCLA was more than happy to take him in. 
</P>
<P>
 Not being on scholarship paid off. Stephenson had only to secure a release 
from Santa Barbara and then was immediately eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 He became the Bruins' No. 1 starter. His numbers weren't great, 5-5 with a 
4.09 ERA, but his stuff was impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really strange how it all worked out," Stephenson said. "I couldn't have 
hoped for more." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So what sort of conversation dominates the Stephenson household? 
</P>
<P>
 Come on. 
</P>
<P>
 Like his father, Stephenson's grandfather is a former major leaguer. Joe 
Stephenson was an infielder for the New York Giants, Chicago Cubs and Chicago 
White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's weird, but our entire family revolves around baseball," Brian Stephenson 
said. "That's all we talk about during dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call them after every start. They always have advice for me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Playing for an independent team has its advantages. There's diversity, for one 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul O'Hearn, who was not drafted after going 9-1 for North Alabama, is now 
the ace of the staff for the Ogden Raptors, who are chasing Helena in the 
Southern Division of the Pioneer League. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hearn is 7-4 with a 3.15 ERA. One would think they would be taking very good 
care of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Nope. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hearn, who hasn't played in the field since Saddleback High School in 1988, 
has been pressed into service as a reserve outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some players quit, so our manager got the pitchers together and looked 
us over," O'Hearn said. "He came to me and said, 'You're now a backup right 
fielder.' Before each game, he tells me to keep my cleats on. I usually wear 
turf shoes when I'm not pitching." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hearn doesn't mind the extra duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I love it," O'Hearn said. "I get to take batting practice. Now that's 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, O'Hearn's fielding skills haven't been tested.

BULLFROGS' SEMIFINAL SERIES STARTS AT PORTLAND TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs open their Western Conference final series tonight against the 
Portland Rage at the Memorial Coliseum in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 2 of the Roller Hockey International playoff series will be at 7:30 p.m. 
on Tuesday at The Pond of Anaheim.If the teams split the series, a 12-minute 
mini-game will follow Game 2 to decide who will advance to the RHI championship 
series against the Eastern Conference champion, the winner of the 
Buffalo-Minnesota series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs, who won the RHI championship last season, finished the regular 
season losing five of their last six games. But a different team has shown up 
for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never lost confidence in this team," Bullfrogs Coach Grant Sonier said. 
"During the season, there were times we were very undisciplined and it cost us. 
In the playoffs, we've been focused." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs have won four consecutive playoff games, including a two-game 
sweep of the Blades in the Pacific Division finals. 
</P>
<P>
 In the playoffs, Victor Gervais is the Bullfrogs' hot scorer, with a 
league-high 11 goals in four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Goalie Rob Laurie, who struggled in the second half of the season, has 
returned to top form. He has four victories in four playoff starts and leads 
the league in post-season save percentage. Laurie is 7-0 in seven career RHI 
playoff starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland is led by forwards Andy Rymsha and Brian Downey, the two top scorers 
in the RHI playoffs with 19 and 17 points. The Rage averaged more than nine 
goals in four playoff games. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

THE FORCE IS WITH 'TENOCHTITLAN'; POP MUSIC REVIEW: THE SECOND MAJOR ROCK EN 
ESPANOL FESTIVAL OF THE YEAR SHOWCASED THREE OF THE MOST INTERESTING YOUNG 
BANDS FROM SOUTH OF THE BORDER IN POWERFUL PERFORMANCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "Empty your pockets and get rid of your gum" was the security policy on 
Saturday at the Hollywood Palladium for yet another Mexican rock concert, as 
guards confiscated everything from Wrigley's to ballpoint pens. But despite the 
uneasy atmosphere at the door, the party -- which drew about 1,500 fans -- 
lacked any major incidents and went on as expected: wildly peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rock de Tenochtitlan," the second major rock en espanol festival of the year, 
was a showcase of three of the most interesting young bands from south of the 
border -- Guadalajara's straight-ahead rockers La Cuca and Mexico City's 
multifaceted La Lupita, plus Puebla's punk-ska sextet Victimas del Dr. Cerebro. 
The popular and improved L.A. power-trio Ley de Hielo, which opened, made a 
strong impression in its first major concert. 
</P>
<P>
 While the show wasn't as colorful and big as February's "Revolucion '94" at 
the Universal Amphitheatre, "Tenochtitlan" (the indigenous name for Mexico 
City) easily had the edge in intensity, even though the Palladium is not the 
best place for listening to music. That didn't matter for those in the frenzied 
pit, who staged one of the most aggressive slam-dancing displays in recent 
memory, while the four bands were busy trying to make up with power what they 
lacked in sound quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Victimas, a father-and-sons act whose use of skeleton masks and other symbols 
enhances their humorous, very Mexican look at death, solidified the popularity 
they had established here with their major-label debut album and a previous 
small-club show. 
</P>
<P>
 But La Cuca (or simply Cuca, short for cucaracha -- cockroach) was the band 
that everyone wanted to see. Almost two years after its debut album, the band 
was the only major Mexican group that hadn't played Los Angeles, and the long 
wait seemed worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Alfonso Fors (who recently replaced his brother Jose) had no problems 
communicating with the banda (rock fans) in the pit and proved that La Cuca 
still is one of Mexico's most powerful and entertaining groups. The quartet, 
which has a Ramones-like aggression and image, strikes a tough stance, but it's 
really a self-parody that's ideal for its irreverent, crude and often plain 
dirty humor. That package makes them their country's best band from outside the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the anticipation for Cuca, it was fair that La Lupita was the closing 
act. The quintet has a soaring mix of grunge, pop, funk and metal, and even 
offers punkish renditions of original and classic nortena songs. Again, 
however, Rosa Adame -- arguably Mexico's best female singer -- was the victim 
of the faulty sound, and her voice couldn't equal co-singer Hector Quijada's 
raunchy, powerful presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Among their new songs, La Lupita was at its best with "Cada vez peor" ("It 
Gets Worse Every time"), a pessimistic, Led Zeppelin-meets-Santana take on 
Mexico's political situation, the funky "Tu y tus tatus" ("You and Your 
tattoos"), and "Me cae," an original nortena by Los Tigres del Norte. Too bad 
none of these bands -- unlike the genre's biggest stars, Caifanes, Maldita 
Vecindad and Cafe Tacuba -- have been able to match the quality of their live 
performances with equally powerful recordings. The goose-bump-producing sound 
and original songwriting style these acts display each time they go out cries 
to be properly documented

SALONEN HAS A TRIUMPHANT HOMECOMING IN FINLAND; MUSIC: THE INAUGURAL CONCERT OF 
THE L.A. PHILHARMONIC'S EUROPEAN TOUR WAS GREETED BY A RAPTUROUS SEVEN-MINUTE

 Esa-Pekka Salonen couldn't have asked for much more. 
</P>
<P>
 When the native Finnish conductor led the Los Angeles Philharmonic through its 
inaugural concert of a European tour Saturday night, the normally reserved 
Finns in the audience stood in a rapturous, rhythmic ovation for seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could really feel the audience," Salonen told the orchestra at Sunday's 
rehearsal. "It was a historic occasion. I've never seen a Helsinki audience 
behave like this before." 
</P>
<P>
 There were two encores before the night was over, a perfect start to a 
three-week tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 1,700 people packed Finlandia Hall in central Helsinki to hear Salonen 
conduct the orchestra in its first appearance in his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening concert included Beethoven's Overture to "Die Weihe des Hauses," 
Witold Lutoslawski's Fourth Symphony and Sibelius' Second Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Margareta Tolvanen, who seldom goes to concerts, paid $200 for three tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very expensive, but a great experience," she said. "The Lutoslawski 
and Sibelius were exciting, even thrilling and our 10-year-old son wasn't bored 
for a moment." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the Los Angeles Philharmonic was to perform Paul Hindemith's 
"Mathis der Maler" and Anton Bruckner's Third Symphony in a televised concert. 
</P>
<P>
 After Helsinki, the orchestra will play at the Royal Albert Hall in London, in 
the BBC Henry Wood Promenade Concerts, celebrating its appearance there 20 
years ago, the first by an American orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Proms are always an amazing experience," said Roy Tanabe, a violinist 
with the orchestra for 30 years. "The audience really gives us a buzz." 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-city tour includes Birmingham, England, Ghent and Brussels, Belgium, 
and the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. Philharmonic also will play in five German cities, including at the 
Berlin Festival to mark the final departure of the Allied troops from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "European tours are always very important because it's a real challenge for us 
to play here," Tanabe said. "The audiences are very attentive." 
</P>
<P>
 "Last night was special because Finnish audiences, like the Japanese, are 
genuine and don't easily get excited. The rhythmic clapping was a step above a 
standing ovation," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, the orchestra plans to tour the United States, hoping to increase 
its prestige. 
</P>
<P>
 Skipping over puddles on a sidewalk, Salonen said the European trip was like a 
stepping stone for the American tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to heighten the profile of the orchestra in touring and 
international exposure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finland's largest newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat wrote Sunday that the L.A. 
Philharmonic was challenging what are generally considered the five great U.S. 
orchestras, in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Philadelphia and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm convinced that Salonen's presence will further improve the standing of 
the orchestra," said Ernest Fleischmann, managing director of the Los Angeles 
contingent. "Already, there are people who no longer talk about the Big Five 
but about the Big Six."

SCREENING ROOM: SILENT MOVIE'S FESTIVAL OPENS A TROVE OF RARE TREASURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Silent Movie's fourth annual film festival, always a treasure-trove, opens 
tonight at 8 with "Nell Gwyn" (1926), with Dorothy Gish in the title role as 
the mistress of Charles II. The theater, which normally screens on Wednesdays, 
Fridays and Saturdays, will present a different program at 8 each night through 
Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the lively yet subtle direction of Britain's Herbert Wilcox, Gish is an 
exquisite Nell, the Drury Lane orange peddler who caught the eye of aging, 
rakish Charles II (Randle Ayrton). Gish's Gwyn has an uninhibited, hoydenish 
spirit that glows with an innate sensitivity and intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Wilcox tells it in this handsome, beautifully photographed British 
production, Gwyn and Charles were caught up in a genuine love story, not merely 
in a sexual liaison. You have to suspect that Gish was inspired by the enduring 
romance of Marion Davies and William Randolph Hearst, so strongly is her Gwyn 
in the effervescent, selfless and loyal spirit of Davies. The film, which 
Wilcox remade in 1934 with his wife, Anna Neagle, could use a tad more dramatic 
adversity but is nonetheless a charmer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Silent Movie's Lawrence Austin preserved the 1928 "The Dove" (Tuesday) 
just in time, for its final reel had started to deteriorate. Its romantic tale 
couldn't be more familiar: A gambler (Gilbert Roland) falls for a dancer (Norma 
Talmadge) at a cabaret in an exotic clime (here, the Mediterranean coast) only 
to incur the jealous wrath of the gross local bigwig (an over-the-top Noah 
Beery).  
</P>
<P>
 It was the second of three teamings of Roland and Talmadge, whose reported 
off-screen romance was so torrid that Roland called a males-only press 
conference at the Hollywood Athletic Club to squelch the rumor that Talmadge's 
estranged husband, producer Joe Schenck, had not in fact had the handsome star 
castrated. It is of even greater interest as one of the few films by the 
stylish Roland West, master of the tracking shot, whose career and life were 
forever blighted when he became a prime suspect in the still-mysterious death 
of comedian Thelma Todd in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
 It's fortunate that director Herbert Brenon is represented by the delightful, 
often-revived 1924 "Peter Pan" (Wednesday), starring Betty Bronson in the title 
role, because he can't do much with the tedious 1929 "The Rescue" (Thursday), a 
notably awkward adaptation of the Joseph Conrad novel, which finds adventurer 
Ronald Colman in the Java Sea becoming entangled with a tempestuous married 
beauty (Lily Damita, best known as the first wife of Errol Flynn), while trying 
to protect a rajah from rebellious natives.  
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, "The Rescue" is preceded on Thursday by Cecil B. DeMille's 1917 "The 
Woman God Forgot." An archetypal early silent spectacle with absurdly elaborate 
costuming and a heavily declamatory style of emoting -- it can't really be 
called acting -- it is a vivid, campy pleasure in which opulent opera star 
Geraldine Farrar (who made a series of pictures with DeMille) plays Montezuma's 
daughter, who falls in love with one of Cortez's handsome captains (Wallace 
Reid). 
</P>
<P>
 Friday brings a Buster Keaton evening, highlighted by one of his early 
talkies, "Free and Easy" (1930), in which Keaton was clearly feeling anything 
but as an agent who attempts to promote the Hollywood career of a young actress 
(Anita Page) only to become captivated by filmmaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Loretta Young plays the adopted daughter of Pagliacci-like circus performer 
Lon Chaney in the 1928 "Laugh, Clown, Laugh" (Saturday). Typically, Chaney 
conceals his passionate love for Young, who's attracted to a younger man.  
</P>
<P>
 It will be followed by Thomas Ince's fascinating, newly restored 1914 "The 
Wrath of the Gods," in which an American seaman (Frank Borzage, soon to become 
a major director) is shipwrecked on a remote Japanese island, where he falls in 
love with the daughter (Tsuru Aoki) of a local fisherman (Sessue Hayakawa). 
Never mind that the family is cursed because an ancestor defiled a temple, with 
the result that no one wants to marry Aoki; Borzage simply produces a cross and 
a Bible. Nonetheless, their love for each other has a literally cataclysmic 
impact. "The Wrath of the Gods" is primitive and emotionally extravagant but 
has terrific energy and scope.

 Cindy Crawford, ravishing supermodel and constant gossip object, makes her 
big-screen debut opposite William Baldwin in Warner Bros.' "Fair Game," which 
will hit movie screens next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Silver seems to be the producer, but we know nothing else because Warners 
wouldn't even admit there was such a film: "How can we tell you if it's a 
comedy or drama when we don't know what you're talking about?" (Sometimes show 
biz seems like an endless replay of "Gaslight." All the PR reps are Charles 
Boyer, and we are Ingrid Bergman, being driven insane.) 
</P>
<P>
 Filming on "Fair Game" begins later this year, no matter what Warners won't 
say.

 Leslie Caron, the movies' divine "Gigi," is meeting with costume designer 
Renee Kalfus in Paris today, discussing Caron's wardrobe for Savoy's "Let It Be 
Me." This will be Leslie's first American-made movie in 30 years. (She has 
traveled to America to appear in TV shows such as "Falcon Crest," but she gave 
up on Hollywood movie-making. She preferred Europe, where she could age 
naturally, and choose interesting roles that did not make her appear either 
silly or grotesque -- her two brief scenes in Louis Malle's "Damage," for 
example.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Let It Be Me," directed and written by Eleanor Bergstein, is about three 
couples whose lives entwine and change at a Manhattan ballroom dance studio. 
Jennifer Beales and Campbell Scott also star. (Bergstein brings good credits 
and experience to this tale -- she wrote and produced "Dirty Dancing.") Filming 
begins in New York City after Labor Day.

<P>
 So who wins the next on-screen dance with new movie throb Hugh Grant? It will 
be Julianne Moore, last seen in Robert Altman's "Short Cuts." Julianne and Hugh 
will star in 20th Century Fox's romantic comedy "9 Months." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Columbus directs, and the movie begins San Francisco location shooting 
in mid-October.

POP; MIXED POP GROOVES AT GREEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A few hours of charged, feel-good pop emerged at the Greek Theatre on 
Saturday, the latest stop on a summer tour teaming the neo-hippie rock of the 
Spin Doctors with the Gin Blossoms' emotional jangling and Cracker's wry Angst. 
 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, the combination of acts might appear unworkable, particularly 
with the possibility of Cracker's edgier (though never mean-spirited) sound 
colliding with the Spin Doctors' softer groove. But the Blossoms bridged that 
gap with songs that were both warm and aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 The energetic quintet from Tempe, Ariz., never stopped moving, bouncing, 
dancing and shaking their hair over their faces as they performed songs that 
were part Byrds, part modern rock. Robin Wilson made snapshots on stage with a 
Polaroid camera to toss to the crowd. And guitarists Scott Johnson and Jesse 
Valenzuela often burst through the good-time rhythms of such radio hits as "Hey 
Jealousy" with aggressive guitar work before submerging again. 
</P>
<P>
 Cracker leader and self-described shouter David Lowery returned from his own 
quartet's earlier set to share vocals on the Blossoms' "Keli Richards." Wearing 
a white 10-gallon hat and cowboy boots, Lowery paced maniacally to the borrowed 
lyrics, showing the same dramatic presence that's been at his disposal since 
his days in the '80s as part of Camper Van Beethoven. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spin Doctors can claim none of that focus, though such hits as "Little 
Miss Can't Be Wrong" offer an infectious blend of jazzy groove pop. While much 
of the band's other material was hit-and-miss, Eric Shenkman's guitar work 
saved many of the songs from imploding into aimlessness, once even adding to 
the band's standard jingle-jangle by chopping out a chord ready enough for 
AC/DC. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Christopher BarronCQ was otherwise preoccupied with his cartwheels, 
kicks and other awkward dance moves. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether the band was performing old songs or material from the new "Turn 
It Upside Down" album, the Spin Doctors were at their best when their efforts 
were anchored to a solid pop hook.

MUSIC; A BOUNTY OF BARTOK AT GETTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The polished professionalism and imaginative programming encountered at the J. 
Paul Getty Museum on Saturday are hardly common summertime happenings in our 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a concert -- the summer's last at the Getty -- to satisfy the 
cravings of the most demanding connoisseur of the not-always-approachable art 
of Bela Bartok, to whom the entire evening was devoted. 
</P>
<P>
 First came the manifold glories of the First String Quartet, played by an 
apparently ad hoc ensemble comprising violinists Roger Wilkie and Clayton 
Haslop, violist Michael Nowak and cellist Rowena Hamill. 
</P>
<P>
 A more probingly subtle, sonorous and cohesive exposition of its darting lyric 
suggestions and ever-shifting rhythms is difficult to recall, even from the 
celebrated, permanently constituted groups that have brought it to town in 
recent seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's midsection offered a male vocal octet, under the scrupulous 
direction of Nick Strimple, in a selection of Bartok arrangements of Slovak 
folk songs and, even more engrossingly, the quirky modalities and offbeat 
rhythms of the Opus 50 set of Old Hungarian Folk Songs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Strimple singers presented this rarely encountered (anywhere, we'd wager) 
material with a thrilling blend of concert-hall polish and folksy vigor. 
Individual credits for the singers were inexcusably absent from the printed 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening concluded with the bracing strains of the 1938 "Contrasts," in 
which clarinetist Amanda Walker crooned, bawled and caressed the part created 
for Benny Goodman with lushly varied tone and all the rhythmic cheekiness in 
the world, while violinist Haslop attended to his duties with unassuming 
virtuosity without giving in to the temptations of "expressive" scraping. 
</P>
<P>
 One had to take on faith a good deal of what the fluent and strong pianist, 
Joanne Pearce-Martin, was doing, since the acoustics of the Getty's Peristyle 
Garden do strange, blurry things to the piano's bass. But there could be no 
doubt that the three artists were functioning as a tightly knit unit, 
sensitively attuned to the Bartok idiom. 
</P>
<P>
 Our only regret regarding an evening offering such rewards was that it might 
have been a one-shot affair. Anything this good deserves repetition, even 
permanence.

JAZZ REVIEWS; GIBBS QUARTET LACKS COHESION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART * Gerry Gibbs plays Thursday-Saturday, 9 and 11 p.m., at the 
Club Brasserie, Bel Age Hotel, 1020 N. San Vicente Blvd., West Hollywood. $7.50 
cover charge, no minimum. Information: (310) 854-1111. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the beginning of the year, New York-based drummer Gerry Gibbs came to his 
former hometown and played two Thursday-through-Saturday gigs at the Club 
Brasserie with a solid quartet, performing modern mainstream stuff that sounded 
pretty darn good, even on opening night. 
</P>
<P>
 Back again for a similar stint at the same room, Gibbs got off to a rocky 
start on Thursday. Though he used two of the people who were here last time -- 
sax man Ravi Coltrane and pianist Patrice Rushen (she played one week then, 
Billy Childs the other) -- his quartet lacked cohesion. 
</P>
<P>
 Individually, the musicians all played well. Gibbs delivers brisk, clean time, 
Coltrane works with a buoyant, round tone, Rushen offered sparkling chains of 
notes, and bassist Derek Oles issued firm bottom tones. 
</P>
<P>
 But during that first set, the players rarely jelled as a band. Reading Gibbs' 
sometimes difficult though expressive originals, the musicians appeared 
under-rehearsed, scrambling first to make their way through the heady material, 
and worrying about unity second. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Gibbs was setting his sights too high. Tunes such as the 
stop-and-start "The Band of Losers" were interesting but demanding, and would 
challenge any group of musicians, not to mention listeners. But songs like 
these don't readily establish a groove -- that flow which allows musicians, 
especially those that don't often play together, to get comfortable and feel 
each other out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Silence After the Ear," a lyrical piece played over a resilient thack-a-whack 
bossa-rock beat, was in decided contrast. Here, everyone relaxed as Coltrane 
offered elastic tones that soared like a hawk seeking prey over chaparral, and 
Rushen dropped in chords that chattered quietly. More numbers like this would 
help both the musicians interact, and reach the audience. ZAN STEWART * Gerry 
Gibbs plays Thursday-Saturday, 9 and 11 p.m., at the Club Brasserie, Bel Age 
Hotel, 1020 N. San Vicente Blvd., West Hollywood. $7.50 cover charge, no 
minimum. Information: (310) 854-1111.

JAZZ REVIEWS; TORME AND LAWS DELIVER A MIXED PROGRAM AT THE BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The real Mel Torme and the real Hubert Laws showed up at the Hollywood Bowl on 
Friday. But just barely. 
</P>
<P>
 Laws spent most of the first half of the program playing a peculiar collection 
of classical transcriptions with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, under the 
baton of Luther Henderson III.To his credit, he demonstrated, in a pleasant 
little Concertino for Flute by Cecile Chaminade, that he is capable of 
performing with an impressive, classically based flute sound, and near-flawless 
technical articulation. 
</P>
<P>
 But rearrangements (by Laws and composer Bob James) of Ravel's "Bolero" and 
segments from Tchaikovsky's "Romeo and Juliet" were ruinous efforts to inject 
contemporary stylistic devices and improvisations into the original 
compositions. "Romeo and Juliet" was awful -- not quite as bad as "Hooked on 
Classics" but close. "Bolero" was worse, with an especially destructive 
evisceration of the work's most significant asset -- its spellbinding, nonstop 
crescendo. 
</P>
<P>
 Freed of pretentiousness by his own ballad "My Time Will Come," Laws played 
beautifully, soloing with a soaring lyricism that fully displayed the talent 
and creativity that rarely had the chance to emerge during the classical 
transcriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Torme's handicap was a program titled "Mel and the Movies." Obliged to sing a 
mixed bag of tunes ranging from Disney to MGM musicals, Torme did his 
journeyman best. But songs such as "Tenement Symphony" and his own seven-minute 
set piece about a county fair (eventually rejected by Disney) were too much 
even for his considerable skills at musical resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Torme also sang "What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?," "It 
Might as Well Be Spring" and "Lover, Come Back to Me" -- songs in which his 
gorgeous head tones, sparkling improvisational abilities and unerring sense of 
swing finally had the opportunity to step front and center. DON HECKMAN

POP MUSIC REVIEW; INDIGO GIRLS ALL BUSINESS ON LOVE TUNES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before their own headlining set at the Universal Amphitheatre on Friday, the 
Indigo Girls joined their opening act, the Big Fish Ensemble, for a spry 
version of Nick Lowe's "(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the last time the Indigos would bring to mind the words spry and funny 
that night, as their own songs of love and understanding are somber business 
indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 After five years on the national scene, Atlanta's Amy Ray and Emily Saliers 
come off like co-chairs of the Important Artist Society, Sensitive Folkie 
Division. Their recent "Swamp Ophelia" album lightens the load a bit with 
well-crafted musical ornamentation, underscoring a developing maturity and 
grace in their writing.  
</P>
<P>
 But as an acoustic duo on Friday (the first of two nights at the Universal) 
they were free to throw the weight of their material around to their heavy 
hearts' content -- harmonic pronouncement after pronouncement, punctuating 
strum after strum, same-sounding song after song.  
</P>
<P>
 Second-billed Kristin Hersh (on leave from Throwing Muses) also took the 
ultra-serious approach, though there's an intimate intensity to her songs, 
suggesting a coffeehouse Sinead O'Connor. Unfortunately, that quality was 
largely lost in the big venue. STEVE HOCHMAN

TV REVIEW; TBS TACKLES EARTH'S PROBLEMS, SOLUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a dramatic case of TBS' "Network Earth" show going big budget and high 
profile, the two-hour special report "People Count" is a monument to Ted 
Turner's ability to put bucks behind his passions. 
</P>
<P>
 Split into three sections ("The Facts of Life," "Facts of the Heart" and 
"Facts of the Mind"), "People First" promulgates a three-part message: 
Exploding global population is outstripping the resources to sustain it; 
educated and employed women will become more than just child-bearers and will 
thus bear fewer children; our awareness of global problems must overcome our 
stone-age brains programmed for mere survival and propagation. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no accident that the program is airing on the eve of the already 
controversial U.N. Conference on Population and Development, whose draft 
proposals are under attack by Roman Catholic and Islamic officials for 
promoting abortion as a contraceptive device. "People Count's" linkage of 
population pressures, social change, women's liberation and new evolutionary 
thinking is the kind of progressive thinking bound to get conservative 
religious leaders into an uproar. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, the presence of host Jane Fonda is also bound to get just plain 
conservatives into an uproar. If they can get past their notion that Mrs. Ted 
Turner should be living in Hanoi, they will find a TV analysis that cleanly and 
simply (sometimes, too simply) puts many complex pieces together.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the "Facts of Life" segment, Los Angeles urban critic Mike Davis laments 
the course of this city from an urban "garden" to "the most militarized city in 
America," which stems, he believes, from a lack of any coherent development 
planning. It could be worse, though, as evidenced by Mexico City, where smog 
alerts have caused birds to drop dead out of the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities seem to be opting for a hopeful alternative, with Chattanooga, 
Tenn. learning to get rid of its smog and other ills from Brazil's 
"environmental city," Curitiba -- a fascinating example of the South educating 
the North. 
</P>
<P>
 Though prone to being condescending to Third World village women, 
photojournalist Barbara Pyle, in "Facts of the Heart," traces interesting 
living experiments in the Philippines, India and Jamaica, where enterprises and 
programs have proven that employed, educated women directly affect birthrates 
and bring wealth to local communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The solutions may begin in our brain, suggests the final segment, though not 
all of the impressive cast of neuroscientists and thinkers (from Melvin Konner 
and Patricia Churchland to Robert Ornstein and Sam Keen) agree.  
</P>
<P>
 "Network Earth" reporters Peggy Knapp and David Mattingly help to provide a 
visually clumsy but lucid explanation of how our brains are going to have to 
take on the new task of global awareness -- this, after millennia of thinking 
about just the family, the clan and the village.

PLAYIN' THE ANGLES; TEEN PARLAYS LOVE OF FISHING INTO JOB AS DECKHAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Dustin Devoe is only 17, but as a deckhand on a sportfishing boat, he's an old 
pro. 
</P>
<P>
 This afternoon, he is flipping a double-cheese hamburger on the sizzling 
grill, scooting around the galley in free moments to clean tables. A lanky 
teen-ager whose sunburned nose is peeling, Devoe does everything there is to be 
done on the deck of the Nautilus, from helping anglers bait their hooks to 
dispensing advice on avoiding seasickness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doesn't always work though," Dustin said with a grin to a green-gilled 
landlubber. "About the only thing I don't do well on this boat is keep some 
people from getting sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Dustin first stepped aboard a sportfishing boat owned by the Newport Landing 
two summers ago as an angler, paying to learn about deep-sea fishing. He went 
back the next day, and the next and soon was running around the deck, lending 
the crew a helping hand. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of that summer, he was handed a red Newport Landing T-shirt and 
hired on as a deckhand. He works full time each summer and on the weekends 
during school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fun job. I get to help people who like the same thing I like -- 
fishing," said Devoe, who will be a senior at Monte Vista High School in Costa 
Mesa this year. "And when it's slow, I go fishing. What a job, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
 Devoe is one of about 20 deckhands working on sportfishing boats this summer 
in Orange County. They're mostly high school students who return summer after 
summer to a job they consider more fun than work. At $45 a day, the 10 hours a 
day of fast-paced, physical labor is still hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 Devoe awakes at 5 a.m. five or six days a week to make the Nautilus' first 
run, which leaves the Balboa Island dock at 6 a.m. and returns to shore by 
noon. The second run begins at 12:30 p.m., and the twilight run -- which he 
does not work -- at 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dustin's a natural on a boat," said the vessel's captain, 35-year-old Mark 
Eidemiller of Dana Point. "He knows everything there is to know about working 
on the Nautilus. I wouldn't be surprised if he becomes a captain sometime 
soon." 
</P>
<P>
 On this sunny afternoon, when Eidemiller turns off the boat's engine five 
miles offshore, Devoe jumps on a wooden box and begins to "chum," tossing 
small, wiggling anchovies into the ocean to attract the large tuna, sea bass 
and mackerel the anglers are after. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 10 minutes, some anglers are reeling in their catches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sorry, this one's not big enough," Devoe tells a young woman, as he unhooks a 
barracuda from her line and throws it back. "It has to be at least 28 inches 
long to keep." 
</P>
<P>
 Luck was with another angler, who struggled to reel in a big one. "You're 
doing great! Hang on to it! Don't give in!" Devoe yells as he runs alongside 
the fisherman, making sure he is there if his help is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't. The angler pulls in what turns out to be the biggest catch of the 
day, a 19-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
 When the boat starts back toward shore three hours later, anglers are tired 
but happy. It has been a good day. Almost everyone has reeled in something, and 
those who leave empty-handed say they had fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Devoe's job, however, is not done. He still must fillet the fish of those too 
squeamish to eviscerate their catches. A slit here, a slash there, and minutes 
later the fish is boned. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not my favorite job, but I don't mind it," Devoe said. "Someone's gotta 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 After all the fish have been filleted and packaged, Devoe and the other crew 
members wash and scrub the deck. By the time the Nautilus reaches shore, the 
boat is gleaming again, ready for the twilight run. 
</P>
<P>
 After he gets off work at 6 p.m., Devoe usually heads back to the beach to go 
surfing with friends. Truth be told, he'd rather spend all his summer days on a 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 "But surfing just doesn't pay you money," Devoe said. "Working on a boat does, 
and I like it and it keeps me out of trouble. And that's enough for me."

2 ARE KILLED, 1 WOUNDED IN SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE MARQUIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a quiet city that usually sees one or two killings a year, a man and a 
woman were found shot to death and another woman was critically wounded Sunday 
in what police called a possible murder-suicide or triple murder attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were summoned about 1:15 p.m. by a 15-year-old girl frantically 
reporting she had found three bodies, including that of her father, in the 
living room of the father's second-story apartment in the 5300 block of 
Orangethorpe Avenue, said Sgt. Mark Yokoyama of the La Palma Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The father, identified as Nelson Nonato, 49, was apparently killed by one or 
more shots to the head, as was a woman identified as Sara Guevara, 31, of South 
Gate, Yokoyama said. Another female, also shot in the head, was taken to UC 
Irvine Medical Center. The woman, whose identity was not released pending 
notification of relatives, was not expected to live, Yokoyama said. 
</P>
<P>
 A large-caliber handgun was found at the scene and there were no signs of 
forced entry, burglary or struggle, Yokoyama said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know if it's a murder-suicide or a triple homicide" attempt, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they did not know the relationships among the victims, but 
relatives of Guevara said she was Nonato's former girlfriend and that the 
couple had a 2-year-old daughter together. The little girl, Natalie, was at the 
scene Sunday evening being cared for by family members. 
</P>
<P>
 Guevera's relatives said the third woman might have been Nonato's current 
girlfriend, but they did not know her name. 
</P>
<P>
 Ana Guevara, 19, Sara Guevara's niece, said her aunt had not seen Nonato for 
about a month, since she discovered he had another girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Yokoyama said police received a report of shots fired in the neighborhood 
about 2:30 a.m. Sunday, but officers who responded could not find the source of 
the gunfire. He said it was possible the shots had come from Nonato's 
apartment, but said the officers were summoned by a neighbor on another street, 
not by anyone in Nonato's building. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Christenson, who lives below Nonato's apartment with her husband, Marvin, 
said they heard three popping sounds about 2:30 a.m., a pause, then three more. 
</P>
<P>
 Christenson, 65, said she believed the shots might have been youngsters 
playing with firecrackers, but her husband said he recognized the sounds as 
gunfire. The couple said they did not call police because they could not 
determine the source of the noise. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we did call police, they wouldn't know where to start" looking, said 
Marvin Christenson, 69. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores Daugherty, 58, who lives across from Nonato, said she heard no 
gunfire. Later Sunday, she said, a woman who apparently was Nonato's 
sister-in-law asked to use her telephone after becoming concerned that 
something was wrong at Nonato's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Daugherty said the sister-in-law apparently summoned Nonato's teen-age 
daughter to the scene. When the girl arrived, she "opened the door and started 
screaming," Daugherty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Christenson said that Nonato was a friendly neighbor with whom she had 
chatted from time to time but that she did not him know well. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of neighbors gathered in the building courtyard Sunday night as 
authorities removed the two bodies and evidence.

LAW, HEALTH OFFICIALS SEEK TO ESTABLISH DRUG COURT; JUSTICE: THE FOCUS WOULD BE 
ON REHABILITATING NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS THROUGH TREATMENT, TESTING. FAILURE 
WOULD MEAN JAIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Miami has one. Oakland and Portland, Ore., do too. And now Orange County's law 
enforcement and health care officials are eagerly pursuing the county's first 
drug court, which would mark a dramatic shift in the way the criminal justice 
system handles nonviolent drug addicts. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug court would focus on rehabilitation -- not punishment -- and would 
funnel first-time and repeat drug offenders through a rigorous, months-long 
program of drug treatment and testing. Failure would mean jail or prison, while 
graduates would escape conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal: breaking the vicious cycle of addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not legalization of drugs," said Orange County Superior Court Judge 
David T. McEachen, who is spearheading the effort to make drug court a reality. 
"We are taking the exact opposite approach. Rather than just putting people in 
jail, we're going to give a certain target group a chance . . . to achieve 
total abstinence." 
</P>
<P>
 McEachen said he recently visited drug courts in Oakland and Oregon and came 
away impressed with the possibilities: reducing crime, cutting court costs and 
freeing jail space and other resources for violent criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's drug court is still in the formative stages, but authorities 
hope to pay for part of the program with grants obtained through the federal 
crime bill that was passed by Congress last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The local program would be modeled after other drug courts nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, one judge and courtroom staff are designated as the drug court, and 
eligible defendants are referred there from other courtrooms. The judge is 
responsible for overseeing the program, and the defendants make frequent court 
appearances -- in some cases once a week -- to report their progress. 
</P>
<P>
 A pilot program could begin locally in early 1995, with at most a few hundred 
participants, court officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Executive Officer Alan Slater said it is too soon to say who 
might be eligible, but everyone agrees that violent criminals need not apply. 
Prosecutors estimate that 3,000 to 5,000 people were charged in Orange County 
last year with possessing drugs such as cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a model whose time has come," said Slater, who joined county 
judges, health officials and others at a daylong symposium Friday in Dana Point 
to hear about drug court programs nationwide. "I think a judge said it best: 
'This is a better mousetrap.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The program would involve nearly every facet of law enforcement and county 
government. Many involved say they are proceeding carefully to make sure the 
program is a success -- and not a way for drug addicts to take advantage of the 
legal system. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty. Brent Romney said his office won't back the program 
until he is assured that public safety remains a No. 1 priority. He said the 
program should admit only addicts who meet specific criteria and are likely to 
benefit from treatment and rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "From our point of view, if the person is an addict and the person really 
wants help and we have a program in place, we probably would be very much in 
support of that," said Romney, director of the district attorney's municipal 
court operations. "I think everyone is in agreement. If you can rehabilitate 
them, it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Deputy Public Defender Carl C. Holmes said he believes a drug court 
could reduce crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system is not working and we have to find other solutions to save us from 
the effects of drug use," Holmes said. "There is really no question that drug 
use leads to crime. Drug users support their habits with their crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes said the program is a win-win situation for the judicial system. If a 
defendant successfully completes the program and remains drug free, he or she 
avoids a conviction and the program saves money that otherwise would be spent 
for jails, courts, attorneys and cops. If the defendant fails, he or she still 
faces the original criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have likened it to giving drug addicts a long rope: They can either hang 
themselves or hoist themselves to drug-free living. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes said a drug court might not be wildly popular in conservative Orange 
County. "But we owe it to ourselves, no matter what our political views, to 
fight this problem in the most effective way possible." 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 30 drug courts nationwide, and more than 100 are being 
established. The first started in Miami in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 McEachen said the idea for an Orange County drug court was sparked in May when 
he and Presiding Superior Court Judge James L. Smith heard a presentation on 
such courts at a judicial conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at each other and said, 'This is for us,' " McEachen recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County judges have since been holding meetings with officials from 
various county agencies, including prosecutors, defenders, police, probation 
and health care workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the program appears to be a way to keep people from abusing drugs 
and coming back to court "time after time" while saving taxpayers money. Smith 
has long been a supporter of alternative methods of fighting drugs, and caused 
a flap when he endorsed decriminalizing drugs as a way to gut the profit motive 
of dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 people gathered in Smith's courtroom Thursday to hear more about 
the concept from experts, including Alameda County Municipal Court Judge 
Jeffrey S. Tauber, who helped start the nation's second drug court. 
</P>
<P>
 The strength of the drug court, Tauber told the group, is in linking all the 
various agencies and services to create a circle that prevents people from 
falling through the cracks in the system. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Portland metropolitan area, court officials started a drug court 
program in August, 1991, after surveys showed that up to 75% of all people 
booked on felony charges tested positive for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drugs were eating us alive," Multnomah County Dist. Atty. Mike Schrunk said 
at Thursday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Between August, 1991, and June, 1994, Portland officials diverted about 1,730 
cases into the drug court, with about a third of those offenders graduating 
from the intensive 12-month program. Schrunk said the program has saved more 
than $1 million through reductions in probation, law enforcement and defense 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some success, like the 18 drug-free babies born to program participants, has 
been easy to measure, Schrunk said, while other aspects are more difficult to 
gauge. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schrunk said he knows one thing for sure: "It's been more successful than 
what we were doing."

PICKETS BARE FEELINGS ABOUT NUDITY; PROTEST: GARDEN GROVE GROUP TAKES TO STREET 
TO OPPOSE RUMORED RETURN OF A PROPOSAL FOR A NUDE JUICE BAR. CITY HAS REJECTED 
THE PLAN, NOW IN THE COURTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Put "nude" and "juice bar" together in Garden Grove and you have mixed an 
explosive concoction. 
</P>
<P>
 Proof of that was abundant Sunday along Garden Grove Boulevard near Beach 
Boulevard, where about 120 residents braved the wilting afternoon heat to 
protest the possible return of a proposal to convert an adult bookstore into a 
nude juice bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the rumor -- that the gentleman who owns the store still wants to 
expand and add on that juice bar," said protest organizer Marjorie Garcia, a 
housewife and anti-pornography activist. 
</P>
<P>
 Waldon R. Welty, owner of A-Z Adult Books, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Welty has wanted to turn his one-story building into a two-story juice bar 
featuring nude dancers -- the largest nude juice bar in Orange County. The City 
Council rejected the proposal two years ago, and a Superior Court ruling upheld 
the action. Welty appealed, and a decision from the state Court of Appeal is 
expected soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's totally unknown what the decision of the appellate court will be," Mayor 
Frank Kessler said Sunday. Kessler, in his last year in office, declined to 
comment on the case until the appeal is decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the hot-pink stucco bookstore, protesters waved anti-pornography signs -- 
"Clean Up Garbage Grove," read one -- and cheered motorists who beeped. A dozen 
of the braver souls crossed the street and camped in front of the store. Some 
stood precariously in traffic and took pictures. One man picketed with a parrot 
on his shoulder. Most were worried about crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the children go the theater here, the stores here. We don't need that 
kind of stuff around children," said Roberta Kolano, joined by her 10-year-old 
daughter, Jill. "I think they're inviting criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Kolano was equally disapproving. "People going to nude bars and taking 
off their clothes -- I don't think that's good," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking and crime were on the minds of the City Council and the Planning 
Commission when both panels rejected the juice-bar proposal in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the bookstore had been a site for cruising, solicitation, 
loitering, lewd conduct and noise. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the store was mainly a site of befuddlement. A clerk surprised by 
the protest said he thought the juice bar idea was dead. Troy Kendrick, a 
sympathetic patron, scoffed at the pickets and said such bookstores pose no 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have them everywhere. You ought to teach your children at home," he 
said. "I think this is a good adult bookstore." 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters, many of them from local churches solicited by Garcia, plan to 
turn the heat up on the store -- just in time for the City Council election 
campaign. Councilman Ho Chung, a mayoral candidate, was quick to show his 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is another election year," said Chung as he joined the pickets. "That's 
why people came out to address their voice to the candidates. That's one of the 
political goals."

GLENDALE FIGHTS FOR SURVIVAL OF ALEX THEATER AFTER DEAL SOURS; ENTERTAINMENT: 
THE CITY MUST PAY $600,000 TO KEEP ART DECO PALACE OPEN AFTER MANAGER PLEADS 
POVERTY, CANCELS SHOWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The deal Glendale struck for the Alex Theatre, an Art Deco palace lovingly 
restored by the city and reopened this past New Year's Eve as a performing arts 
center, seemed too good to be true. 
</P>
<P>
 In its first year, the Alex was to bring downtown Glendale six splashy, 
professional musicals plus a variety of other music, dance and theatrical 
offerings. City officials hoped that along with the cultural boost would come a 
surge in night life bringing increased business to local restaurants and other 
establishments in downtown Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, the operation of the Alex was not to cost taxpayers a dime -- 
Glendale was striving to become the first community in the nation to operate a 
major municipal performing arts center without a city subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-year deal the city had made with a theatrical management company 
stipulated that in exchange for the right to produce or book all events at the 
Alex, the company would also provide everything needed to operate the theater, 
including all maintenance and box office staffing. 
</P>
<P>
 It took only eight months for the dream deal to go sour. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week the Glendale City Council voted to spend $600,000 just to keep the 
Alex alive for the rest of the year. The management company was gone, taking 
with it the money collected from 11,000 subscription ticket holders who had two 
more shows left in their series. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst of all for city officials is the bad will caused by this disaster, 
especially among ticket buyers who were promised big shows but probably will 
have to settle for less-extravagant touring productions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just hope people will understand," said a visibly weary Jeanne Armstrong, 
director of the Glendale Redevelopment Agency, which oversaw the restoration of 
the building and is one of the city groups now working to rescue it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have a beautiful building, it can still be a wonderful asset to the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to municipal involvement in the arts, Glendale has learned the 
hard way: Any deal that promises a free ride is probably not only too good to 
be true, but will also end up costing the city a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alex, which opened as The Alexander in 1925 for live shows and films, had 
fallen into disrepair by 1991 when the Glendale Redevelopment Agency completed 
its purchase of the building for about $837,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the theater's renovation, which cost an additional $6.5 million in 
Glendale Redevelopment Agency funds, a 25-person volunteer citizens group was 
formed to study how the building should be used. The group concluded that an 
annual city subsidy of about $450,000 would be needed to operate the Alex as a 
performing arts center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We dealt with several consultants," said Laurence Clarke, a lawyer who 
chaired the group. "I think they all told us that every city performing arts 
theater required a subsidy and usually a substantial subsidy to keep it in 
operation." 
</P>
<P>
 In a nationwide search of management for the Alex, the city sent requests for 
proposals to numerous theatrical firms -- including major Broadway theater 
owners such as the Shuberts. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one company responded, and it was right next door to Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 The Theatrical Corporation of America, headed by David Houk, is based in 
Pasadena, where it operates the venerable Pasadena Playhouse. Houk had received 
widespread praise for revitalizing the 700-seat Playhouse, which he had 
operated since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alex presented a far greater challenge, however. At 1,400 seats, its 
operational costs would be higher and the large-scale musicals Houk wanted to 
produce there would require hefty budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 To make ends meet, Houk proposed that productions mounted at the Alex would 
then move on to theaters in San Diego and Fresno. The home for that operation 
would be the Alex, where the Theatrical Corporation of America, also known as 
TCA, would be able to book other events between musicals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a seductive deal," Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal even called for Glendale to get a piece of the Alex's revenue if the 
theater was a hit. After the first $5 million in gross income during a year, 
the city would receive 1% of the gross. And the city's percentages would get 
higher as revenue increased. 
</P>
<P>
 Profits were not the primary consideration for the Alex's board, however. "The 
big incentive for the city was to have a viable theater," Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeated requests for interviews with Houk and other TCA company officials for 
this article received no response. But the deal clearly offered TCA a shot at 
becoming a far more prominent theatrical producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke said the board had not forgotten the consultants' warnings about the 
need for subsidies, but he said TCA's "novel approach" won them over. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew this was a big step up for them from the Pasadena Playhouse, that it 
was a different category of show financially, but their plan to build a solid 
subscription base here and in the other cities made sense." 
</P>
<P>
 After the New Year's Eve opening bash at the Alex, which was produced as a 
benefit for the theater, TCA took over. 
</P>
<P>
 For several months, the operation appeared successful. With an aggressive 
telemarketing campaign, TCA signed up 14,000 subscribers for its first series 
of three musicals: "Sayonara," "Mame" (with Juliet Prowse) and a stage 
adaptation of the film "Fame." 
</P>
<P>
 While these productions broke no artistic ground, the audiences responded well 
and by spring, TCA officials were telling reporters that business at the 
theater had exceeded expectations. Nearby restaurant owners were delighted with 
the considerable additional business on performance nights. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alex seemed to be everything the board had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 The first hint of trouble, Clarke said, came at the start of the second 
three-show subscription series, which was to start off with "Sophisticated 
Ladies." 
</P>
<P>
 TCA officials came to them, he said, to explain that because of some budgeting 
problems they would instead present "Fashion," an obscure musical that had once 
played off-Broadway. It would cost far less to produce, but Clarke said the 
board was assured it was a quality musical. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, only a week before "Fashion" was go into rehearsal, Clarke said, the 
bombshell was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 TCA was broke, the board was told, even though it had just sold 11,000 
subscriptions for the series, and did not have enough money to get "Fashion" up 
and running, let alone the other two scheduled shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to describe what it was like to hear that," Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
 What had happened, board members demanded, to the subscription money? TCA, 
Clarke said, told the board those funds had been used to pay off cost overruns 
incurred during the first season. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time, Clarke said, the board had been apprised of cost 
overruns. "Up until then it was just 'rah, rah, rah, everything is great,' " he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board loaned TCA about $100,000 out of its fund-raising kitty to get 
"Fashion" produced. But even with the additional funds, it was clear the show 
was a cut-rate production. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first preview, the performers were so distressed that they 
threatened to quit. That night, the mayor and several other city officials went 
backstage to "beg" them to stay on, according to Glendale Redevelopment Agency 
Director Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The reviews were terrible and at many performances, audience members left 
before the final curtain. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the "Fashion" run, the board and TCA parted company, and the 
board took back control of the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Season subscribers who called TCA offices were told they would not be getting 
refunds for the two remaining shows, Armstrong said. Instead, subscribers were 
offered tickets to Pasadena Playhouse plays or to a local group's outdoor 
performances of Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that was not what buyers had in mind when they bought tickets for 
the series of musicals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alex board felt it had to act, even though Clarke maintains the board is 
not technically liable because TCA sold the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt a moral obligation to these people," he said. "The reputation of the 
theater was besmirched, no doubt about it, by what happened, but we felt we had 
to do something, anything, to make it up to people and get back on track." 
</P>
<P>
 The board has booked a touring production of "Dreamgirls" to fill the second 
slot in the series. The production is by a non-Equity company, which means that 
the performers will probably not be seasoned. But Clarke said reviews in other 
cities have been good. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the time constraints that we had to put this together, we hope people 
will understand we are doing the absolutely best we can," he said. The board is 
now searching for a production to fill the third slot. 
</P>
<P>
 The $600,000 given to the board as a loan by the City Council will pay 
production costs for the two shows and keep the theater open until the end of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the future, board members have not had the luxury of leisure time to do 
extensive planning. But they know what they don't want. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would tend to doubt we would ever get into the situation of turning over 
the theater, again, to anyone unless we had absolute direct control over the 
finances," Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also not likely the Alex would again get into the speculative business of 
producing its own musicals. And for next year, the board plans to ask the city 
for a subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke said the board is looking for an experienced manager to run the 
theater, probably mostly as a booking house for local and touring events. That 
manager, who would be an employee answering directly to the board, would have 
to be comfortable with a lot of supervision, to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who can't deal with micro-management for the next year or two is not 
the right person for the job," Clarke said. "We were burned once and it was a 
bitter lesson. But it was a lesson nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someday, we hope this will be looked upon as just an unfortunate chapter in 
the history of this theater."

THE SADNESS LINGERS; CRASH: TRAGEDY IN WHICH THREE DIED ALSO LEFT TEEN-AGER SO 
BADLY INJURED SHE REQUIRES FULL-TIME CARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 By some miracle, Barbara Du Bois, 14, survived the tragic traffic accident in 
which her sister, another teen-ager and a toddler died, but her grandmother 
said the cheerful girl she once knew no longer exists. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the June 1 accident, the Canyon Country teen-ager had typical 
adolescent ambitions of being a model or a movie star, said Mary McWilliams, 
her grandmother and guardian. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Barbara will require full-time care for the rest of her life because 
her physical injuries were so severe, doctors predict. 
</P>
<P>
 The brain damage she suffered will remain with her for life. Doctors say she 
will never be able to function above the level of a 10- to 12-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 "She doesn't comprehend any part of that," McWilliams said. "She doesn't even 
know about the accident yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The tragic accident consumes the lives of the four families whose young girls 
were in the car that night. In some cases, there are hard feelings on the part 
of family members who believe the accident could have been avoided. In other 
cases, relationships have been formed or strengthened. The sadness lingers 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The five girls in the car that night were returning from a youth group meeting 
at their Saugus church when the car collided head-on with two vehicles on Seco 
Canyon Road. The driver, Barbara's 15-year-old sister, JoKema, reportedly was 
weaving her grandmother's car back and forth to amuse Jesika Noell, 3, and it 
drifted across the road's center line. 
</P>
<P>
 McWilliams said JoKema, who was not licensed to drive, took the car keys 
without her knowledge. Family members of some of the girls who were in the car 
privately dispute that claim, but stop short of condemning McWilliams because 
there is little substance on which to base their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 Killed with JoKema and Jesika was Gena Watkinson, 15. Alicia Acevedo, 14, and 
Barbara were hospitalized in critical condition. Alicia's condition improved 
relatively quickly and she was released from the hospital about a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara was given only a 10% chance to live. But she has defied the odds. 
</P>
<P>
 McWilliams said she watches her granddaughter go through hours of therapy 
daily at Northridge Hospital Medical Center to help her eat, write, stand, 
speak and use her severely injured left hand. She hopes doctors' predictions 
will once again be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't ever expect her to recover fully," she said. "My own personal gut 
feeling is she will recover enough to be able to live a fairly normal life. By 
that I mean she'll get into her 20s and just be slow." 
</P>
<P>
 In a tragic turn of events, McWilliams' ex-husband, Malcom, who was reportedly 
despondent over what happened to his granddaughters, fired a warning shot 
earlier this month at two 14-year-old boys who reportedly were trying to steal 
his car, killing a third 14-year-old youth he did not see. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they arrested the wheelchair-bound Malcom McWilliams, authorities 
said the man's intent was to warn the youths about the dangers of joyriding. 
They later announced they will not file charges against McWilliams. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, hospital officials expect Barbara to remain at the hospital until 
the beginning of December. But she won't be going home then. Her grandmother 
was evicted from her Canyon Country house after failing to make the mortgage 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 McWilliams, now living alone in a relative's motor home in an Elks Lodge 
campground, said financial troubles before the accident led to the eviction and 
that her granddaughters were aware of her plans to move to Arizona or Colorado. 
Now, she said, she is unsure of what she will do, since she has to work and 
won't be able to provide the constant care Barbara will require. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like I'm 35 now, so I know I'm not going to be able to do that 
alone," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia, a close friend of Barbara's, also is receiving physical therapy at the 
Northridge hospital for a broken leg. Her therapy is expected to last several 
more months, said her 16-year-old brother, Angel. She usually stays at the 
hospital after her own therapy sessions to be with Barbara during hers, her 
brother said. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel said the family talks about the accident and that his sister is 
sometimes depressed about it. But she has been able to resume a normal life, he 
said. "We tell her to try not to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Life will never return to normal for Jesika's mother, Jamie Noell, who has a 
congenital spinal disease and is confined to a wheelchair. She rented a room at 
McWilliams' house for more than a year until the accident. After that, she 
moved in with relatives in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed family with me and I was very, very distraught," Noell said. "I just 
could not go back into that house because I cared very deeply about Jesika, 
obviously, but also about (McWilliams') two girls. There would just be too many 
memories in that house." 
</P>
<P>
 She is divorced from Jesika's father, Stephen, who lives in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Noell said she used to spend her days caring for her daughter and her evenings 
painting ceramics she hoped to sell. Now, she spends most of her time thinking 
about Jesika and what to do with the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The little girl's memory remains at Bethlehem Lutheran Preschool, where her 
classmates play in a sandbox built by Jesika's uncle, Lonnie Bernal. The box is 
filled with sand provided by a local gravel company. Her mother said the family 
came up with the idea because of Jesika's comments the first day she attended 
the preschool. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said she had fun, but she had one complaint . . . they don't have a 
sandbox," her mother said. "I said, 'They have sand there,' and she said, 'They 
have sand there, but it's on the ground. I want a sandbox.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A similar gesture for Gena Watkinson was made by the High Desert Horseman's 
Assn., to which she belonged. The organization will present an annual award in 
Gena's name to its "most tenacious rider." 
</P>
<P>
 Her grandmother and legal guardian, Sandra Watkinson, said the award's 
designation is for a remembrance of Gena. "She didn't always win, but she was 
always trying," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The memory of Gena's death brings tears to her grandmother's eyes. Watkinson 
said that part of the pain is because "the whole situation was so needless." 
</P>
<P>
 "I go up to the cemetery at least a couple of times a week and it still 
hurts," she said. "I think the thing that hurts the most is that we never know 
what she could have been. She'll be forever 15."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; APARTMENTS A HAVEN FOR SINGLE MOTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Single mother Michele White is among the lucky ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have something I can call my home and I don't have to deal with the stress 
of living with other people," said White, mother of 2-year-old Anthony. "I've 
never had my own house." 
</P>
<P>
 White, 24, is among eight single mothers with young children who recently 
moved into an apartment house on 11th Street -- a 70-year-old complex that has 
been transformed to a place these parents can call home. 
</P>
<P>
 The women are part of a city-sponsored program called Project 
Self-Sufficiency, which helps single mothers get off government subsidies, go 
to school and find jobs. It's the only program of its kind in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The city bought the apartment complex with redevelopment money and turned it 
over to a nonprofit organization that now owns, manages and maintains the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 A celebration at the apartment complex Friday commemorated the partnership 
between the city and the private sector. A local priest blessed the homes, and 
city officials, business leaders and residents lauded the effort to provide 
low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ones who got in here are the fortunate ones," said Susan M. Edwards, the 
project's director. "It's one of the answers to welfare reform." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Shaw, executive director of the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force, 
said he hopes the program is a growing trend in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "It provides contact for the community and it's the only way you can change 
their perceptions," Shaw said, explaining that all too often, people oppose 
projects for homeless people in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The neighbors are going to see that this is a well-run development and that 
the people here are no different than any of their other neighbors, and they're 
going to come away with a different perception." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Community Housing Corp., which owns the building, invested 
$120,000 to renovate the apartments -- including new plumbing and electrical 
wiring, paint, carpeting, doors and period fixtures from the early 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a posh apartment complex when it was built and it's posh again," said 
Allen P. Baldwin, the housing corporation's executive director. He expects such 
projects to blossom elsewhere. "We're happy this one is done, but the job is 
not done. There will be another one, we just don't know where today." 
</P>
<P>
 The women pay monthly rent of $250 to $300 as well as their utility expenses. 
They go to college, and some work part time to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 For women such as White, who gets $474 in welfare assistance, the apartment 
project is a life-saver. 
</P>
<P>
 White, who pays $250 in rent on her four-year lease, said she would not be 
able to live on her own anywhere else. Now, she said, she has money to buy 
groceries and pay for gas and electricity bills. In addition, she can attend 
Golden West College without interruption. She is studying to become a 
psychiatric nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just makes me feel like I can achieve the goals I have set for myself," 
she said. "It's given me a better outlook on life." 
</P>
<P>
 Her new home also has given her a special camaraderie with the other women in 
her situation. "I have friends here, and we all support each other," she said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: EL MODENA; IT'S NO GANG -- JUST BUSY WORK CREW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cindy Ramirez was sitting outside her El Modena apartment with neighborhood 
boys recently when a police officer pulled over, thinking they were a gang. 
</P>
<P>
 That was nothing new in this unincorporated, largely Latino community outside 
the city of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 But the teen-agers and young adults who hang out with Ramirez, a youth 
coordinator for the El Modena Pride Assn., are too tired to get into trouble 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they scrape, sand and paint houses all day and most of them collapse 
in bed long before their peers even begin to party. 
</P>
<P>
 Their paychecks come from a county grant intended to teach trades to youths. 
</P>
<P>
 But the young men also represent a far-reaching effort by the community's 
adults, who organized as the El Modena Pride Assn., to gain control of their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "People from outside have always wanted to run El Modena and always have run 
El Modena," said Pride Chairman Lupe Hurtado. 
</P>
<P>
 He and other community leaders formed Pride last year so they could credibly 
bid to manage the area's public services. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month they had some success, convincing Supervisor William G. Steiner 
that they deserved a $50,000 county grant to rehabilitate and run El Modena's 
homeless shelter, outbidding three reputable nonprofit organizations in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I picked El Modena Pride is they represent the community 
directly," Steiner said. "They live within the community and they have made a 
diligent effort to commit themselves to this work." 
</P>
<P>
 Pride is still organizing management of the shelter, but right away the 
directors decided to hire neighborhood kids to paint and repair the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Pusavat, the county's director of housing and redevelopment, thought that 
was a great idea. He goes by the adage "It's cheaper to send them to Yale then 
to jail," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the shelter was ready for painting this week, Ramirez's crew also 
had completed 13 painting jobs in homes in the neighborhood, earning the 
minimum wage of $4.25 an hour and holding to the demands of a regular job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these kids are real young -- their parents don't even tell them what 
to do," said Martin Escobedo, a supervisor who at 21 is one of the oldest of 
the 25 crew members. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of them have had to adjust to the concept of arriving on time, keeping 
breaks to 15 minutes and taking orders from their four bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobedo and his brother Tony, 18, who is also a supervisor, had learned the 
trade by helping their father each summer since they were in grade school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was different teaching guys my age instead of having older guys teach me," 
Martin said. "You have to have patience." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez said her role is as much a counselor and mother as a supervisor. And 
she hopes for her flock's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are scared because they dress the way they dress and they look 
the way they look," she said of her crew. "Somebody down the line has got to 
give these boys a second chance. They have hearts, too." LESLEY WRIGHT

VEINS OF GOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID BOHRER / For The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You could say he likes doing things the hard way. When most of us think about 
ways to procure gold, panning for it or buying it come to mind. Clark Sabel of 
Canyon Country has a different method -- hard-rock mining. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabel, 48, has been extracting gold and other precious metals from rock for 17 
years. The hard-rock mining process -- which involves crushing the rock, 
converting it to a concentrate, then bathing it in a water-based chemical 
solution that extracts the precious metals -- is usually reserved for large 
mining operations, not one man. 
</P>
<P>
 With hands scarred from years of doing battle with Mother Earth, Sabel carries 
two plastic buckets up a 200-yard trail in the northeastern Angeles National 
Forest near Palmdale. The hike back down -- with buckets full of more than 110 
pounds of rock -- will be much less forgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 An electrical contractor by trade, Sabel used to call mining a hobby of sorts, 
but has now turned it into a second career. 
</P>
<P>
 This particular mine, which in its heyday in the 1930s made rich men with 
gold, silver, copper and quartz, is now all but vacant. The miners are gone. 
Vandals and campers are some of the more recent visitors who walk by the 
rock-lined walls without realizing their hidden value. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take what others walk right by. They just don't know what they're looking 
at," Sabel says of the gold and other metals in the old mine's rocks and walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the chemical process, which can take from five hours to seven days, 
Sabel extracts gold and other precious metals. 
</P>
<P>
 At best, Sabel will harvest a quarter of an ounce of gold for every 55-pound 
bucket of rock that he mines. He says: "Most people would turn and walk away 
from it. For me, it's all the lure of finding gold. It's taking a piece of 
Mother Nature and saying, 'Look what she gave to Clark.' "

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; LIBRARY FEE PROPOSED FOR NON-RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At Central Library, shelves are empty, science books are outdated, and a 
bestseller might not be available to check out for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line of a library is books," Library Board President Wade Hawley 
said. "If you don't have books to check out or to circulate, it's really hard 
to be a quality library." 
</P>
<P>
 The library's book budget has been cut to $147,000 this year, a significant 
drop from $275,000 in 1989-90, Hawley said. 
</P>
<P>
 To counter the loss, Hawley said, library supporters came up with the proposal 
for a $20 library card fee that would be charged to non-residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee would raise about $200,000 a year to buy new books, Library Director 
Ron Hayden said. Programs and use of materials at the library would still be 
available at no charge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very hard decision for all of us," Hawley said. "The library board 
spent months arguing among themselves because some believe that a library, 
overall, should be free. But the reality of the situation is we cannot continue 
with the way things are going and that's one of the reasons why we proposed the 
fee." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawley said county libraries' reduction in hours, combined with the recent 
addition of the children's wing at Central Library, has triggered an influx of 
patrons using the city library. It is estimated that 40% of library patrons are 
non-residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Caryl M. Harvey, president of Friends of the Huntington Beach Library, said 
that residents are already paying for the library with their tax dollars and 
non-residents should also pay their fair share. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members and library board and support group members plan to meet 
Wednesday to work out a recommendation to the City Council on the use of 
revenue if the non-resident fee is adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping for the best compromise in favor of the library," Hawley said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; OAK MIDDLE SCHOOL STATUS HEARING SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Alamitos Unified School District will hold a public hearing Tuesday to 
consider the reopening of Oak Middle School, which has been closed since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials also will consider ways to finance the reopening of 
the school, including possible sale of district properties that are not being 
used, such as Weaver Elementary School in Rossmoor. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents can present their ideas during the public hearing, scheduled for 7 
p.m. at the Performing Arts Center at Los Alamitos High School, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost to renovate the 23-acre Oak Middle School is estimated at $3.3 
million, according to school district officials. In addition, there will be 
expenses for administrators, new teachers, school employees, and school 
maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling the Weaver Elementary School site would pay for the renovation, school 
district officials said, although they would not say if there is a ready buyer 
nor what the price would be. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the school district also considered selling or leasing Oak Middle 
School to pay for planned improvements to other schools in the district. But a 
group of parents persuaded the school board to keep the school site. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district serves about 7,300 students from Los Alamitos, Rossmoor 
and Seal Beach. McAuliffe Middle School, the only school for sixth-, seventh- 
and eighth-grade students, has currently more than 1,600 students. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials now say that a second middle school would be needed 
for the anticipated 250 more middle grade students in the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the Oak Middle School campus is being used by the Orange County High 
School of the Arts. BERT ELJERA

<P>
 It's a problem anyone gladly would have. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators, teachers and students from the Tustin Unified School District 
will decide during a workshop today how to spend $500,000 in private grant 
money for the science laboratories of two local high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Biologists, chemists, and engineers will assist about 30 workshop participants 
at Toshiba America Inc. in Irvine to design the facilities and select the 
equipment for the science labs at Tustin and Foothill high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Jennings of the Tustin Public School's Foundation said that the two 
schools have been promised $250,000 each through the Irvine Company Challenge 
Grant to equip their science laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to know what we need in those labs to prepare these kids for the year 
2000," said Jennings, executive director of the 5-year-old foundation, which is 
coordinating the fund-raising efforts for the science labs. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; LIQUOR LICENSE RULES MAY BE STIFFENED

 Local business owners wanting to sell alcohol soon may find it harder to get a 
license. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials last week asked the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage 
Control to enforce tighter controls on liquor licenses in an effort to reduce 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said studies have shown that more crimes are committed in areas 
where alcohol is sold extensively, and have asked ABC to limit or deny new 
liquor permits in high-crime neighborhoods or places where alcohol-related 
businesses are concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a crime prevention technique that will better enable us to control 
conditions that create crime," Police Chief James Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other Orange County cities also have asked ABC to apply tougher 
conditions before granting alcohol licenses, according to Marianne J. Eckhoff, 
an investigator at the ABC district office in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange, Santa Ana, Seal Beach and Garden Grove, ABC can deny a license to a 
business located in an area that has 20% more reported crimes than other city 
neighborhoods, Eckhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This allows cities to divert businesses away from certain neighborhoods," she 
said. "This is not anti-business, but a law enforcement tool." 
</P>
<P>
 Eckhoff said that 154 businesses in Westminster hold liquor licenses. They 
include restaurants, nightclubs and stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Bob Gill of the Westminster Police Department said that 14 city 
districts, including sections of Little Saigon, Golden West Street and 
Westminster Boulevard, are considered high-crime areas. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there are 10 census tracts which have a high concentration of 
liquor stores, he said. The police will provide annual crime data to ABC to 
help the agency determine in which areas of the city new liquor licenses could 
be restricted. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: VILLA PARK; COUNCIL ASKS REBATE FOR CABLE SUBSCRIBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A check won't be in the mail any time soon, but the City Council has acted to 
get cable-TV subscribers a small rebate. 
</P>
<P>
 The council last week voted unanimously to direct MultiVision Cable TV to 
rebate about $19 to each of Villa Park's 1,200 subscribers.The council acted 
after city-hired professional consultants said MultiVision charged its 
customers $1.87 a month too much from Sept. 1 to July 15. 
</P>
<P>
 MultiVision officials have said they will appeal the city's action to the 
Federal Communications Commission, City Manager Fred Maley said. Villa Park 
subscribers to the cable service thus should not expect a rebate soon. There is 
also the possibility there will be no rebate if the FCC rules in favor of 
MultiVision, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 During a public hearing on the issue, consultants told the City Council that 
MultiVision has done nothing deliberately wrong. The consultants said the 
alleged overcharge to subscribers is simply a matter of interpretation of FCC 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 William Marticorena, an attorney who was part of the city's consulting team on 
cable TV, told the council: "We are not saying that what MultiVision has done 
is evil. Rather, this is a good-faith dispute." 
</P>
<P>
 Donald R. Granger, regional vice president for MultiVision, said the cable 
firm had not overcharged for any of its services and had strictly obeyed FCC 
regulations. He also charged that Villa Park's consultants had erred by 19 
cents a month in computing the proposed rebate. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council directed its staff to lower the proposed rebate if a recheck 
of figures shows a lesser amount is due to subscribers. The reduced rebate 
would be about $17. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; FATAL FUNGUS IS KILLING PALM TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the quintessential symbols of California -- the palm tree -- is in 
danger because of a fatal fungus that has stricken landmark palm trees in Dana 
Point, Corona del Mar and other Southland cities, officials report. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't realize they're living things, and they have perils that they're 
susceptible to," Newport Beach General Services Director David Niederhaus said. 
"We're going to see a significant denuding of the area over time." 
</P>
<P>
 Canary Islands date palms are particularly susceptible to fusarium wilt 
fungus, and heat accelerates the trees' deterioration, said Howard Ohr, a plant 
pathologist at UC Riverside who is one of the nation's leading authorities on 
palms and palm diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's spread all across the state. . . . Many of the cities that have Canary 
palms have it," he said. "The biggest thing that's misunderstood is how serious 
it is. Once it's in the tree, it's going to die. You try to prolong their life 
by good nutrition and good water, but the longer you do, the more danger there 
is of spreading." 
</P>
<P>
 The fungus gets into the tree's circulatory system through use of unsterilized 
cutting implements, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you cut a green frond, that's when you infect the tree. This particular 
fungus lives in the vascular system of the tree. It blocks all the 
water-conducting tissues of the tree," Ohr said. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to avoid spreading the fungus is to trim only brown leaves and 
sterilize saw blades for five minutes with a 50-50 solution of chlorine bleach 
and water, Ohr said. Using reciprocating saws is better than using chain saws, 
he said, because blades can be switched and sterilized between trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "You won't ever eradicate it, but you can reduce its occurrence," Ohr said, 
adding there is no known chemical treatment and no research underway. "Research 
takes money and, it's a sign of the times, there's no money for it." 
</P>
<P>
 In Corona del Mar, palms along Marguerite Avenue from Ocean Boulevard inland 
to Fifth Street will begin disappearing over the next year, and because of 
their age it is impossible to replace them with palms of similar size, Newport 
Beach arborist John Conway said. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, trees weakened by fusarium wilt are more susceptible to 
another fungus, pink bud rot, which also preys on the more graceful, slender 
California fan palms. 
</P>
<P>
 Mature Canary Island palms cost about $2,500 each now, Conway said, and he 
predicted that increased demand will drive the price up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision has not been made about what size and age (of trees) to use for 
replacements," Conway said. "It's not recommended that you install the same 
kind of trees as replacements because the fungus can get into the soil. We're 
going to recommend some alternate type of palms that would not be as 
susceptible." HOLLY J. WAGNER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ALISO VIEJO; NEW ICE RINK SLATED TO OPEN NEXT MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Klimkowski had staved off his kids' pleas to play ice hockey for 
months. He had a plausible excuse: He didn't want to battle the traffic all the 
way to the nearest ice rink, half an hour away in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The distance excuse won't work anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, three South County entrepreneurs will open the Aliso Viejo Ice 
Palace, the only ice rink in hockey-crazed South County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids want what they can't have," the Laguna Niguel doctor said. "I grew up in 
Connecticut playing ice hockey on the ponds, but we really wanted to surf." 
</P>
<P>
 So Klimkowski will shell out about $1,000 for his 9- and 12-year-old sons to 
play at the Ice Palace -- $200 apiece to join a league, and about $300 apiece 
in equipment. "You come here, and all the kids want to do is play ice hockey. 
Thank goodness for ice rinks." 
</P>
<P>
 The three Ice Palace partners, Glenn Bushway of Trabuco Canyon and Mission 
Viejo residents John Rudenski and Chuck Heathco, hatched the idea for the new 
rink two years ago when they realized the demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we started doing demographic studies and concluded that there was 
definitely a need here," Rudenski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, hundreds of parents have signed up their eager young hockey players 
at the rink on Journey Avenue, near the intersection of Pacific Park Drive and 
Aliso Creek Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the partners originally intended to build the rink from scratch, they 
eventually decided to lease a light-manufacturing building and construct the 
rink inside. The retrofit will cost more than $1 million, Rudenski said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rink should be ready for public skating, adult and youth ice hockey, and 
figure skating by mid to late September, Rudenski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the ice surface, which at 185 by 85 feet can hold up to 300 skaters, 
the rink will have bleachers for 140 people, an enclosed concession stand, two 
private party rooms, a pro shop and a video arcade. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudenski said the rink should help keep bored teens out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem down here is the kids don't have much to do," he said. "They can 
just go to the movies and the mall. The community has been wanting other 
choices." 
</P>
<P>
 Both roller and ice hockey have mushroomed in recent years here, spurred by 
the coming of the Mighty Ducks to The Pond in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Disney movie 'Mighty Ducks 2' just came out on laser disc," Klimkowski 
said. "Now even my 7-year-old is all ready to go out onto the ice." LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; CANS CONVERTED TO AID FOR STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bucky Pofahl never went to college, but at age 76 he's trying to help a few 
students through school -- in an unconventional way. 
</P>
<P>
 With dew still on the ground and the sun just up, he can be seen stooping 
around the Orange Coast College campus collecting bottles and cans. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last four years, all the money he has made has gone to provide 
scholarships of $300 to $500 per student. Pofahl tries to give away at least 
two scholarships each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the least I can do," said Pofahl, whose first name only the bank knows 
and whose nickname he picked up in the Army. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Pofahl used to collect golf balls at municipal golf courses for 
money. But one day four years ago, he spotted a bunch of cans next to the 
dumpster at his Santa Ana apartment and thought to himself he might take a 
crack at that. 
</P>
<P>
 One can led to another and before he knew it he found himself on the college 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, all the security guards at the college know him. Professors know him. 
Administrators know him and so do college students, especially the ones to whom 
he has given money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy's just amazing to me, as old as he is and how much energy he has to 
cart all the cans and bottles around," said Mike Carey, who runs the recycling 
center on campus and sees Pofahl daily. "He gets up at the crack of dawn to do 
it, then still has the energy afterward to play basketball -- or 'shooting 
hoops' as he refers to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pofahl collects about 240 pounds of tin a week -- more than 6,000 cans -- and 
brings them to the recycling center, where he redeems them. 
</P>
<P>
 "And he does all this with no benefit to himself," Carey said. "He gets 
satisfaction out of giving money to others, that's what's so great about it 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Glover, 27, a biology major and recipient of Pofahl's generosity, got $300 
last year, which he used for tuition and books. "With the increasing prices of 
college these days, it certainly came in handy," said Glover, who wants to 
publish an environmental magazine that would be mailed to 25,000 families in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel environmental education is going to be the way of the future," he 
added. "If kids start learning young, they'll appreciate the natural resources 
this country has and will carry it with them into adult life." 
</P>
<P>
 Pofahl, a retired lumber salesman of 46 years, agrees with Glover. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the kids, they've got to learn how to play ball," he said. "They've got 
to learn to put the cans in the slots of the (recycling) bins, or else it's 
just more work for me." TOM RAGAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; CAL STATE CHIEF FISCAL OFFICER TO LEAVE POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After spending a decade as Cal State Fullerton's vice president for 
administration and chief fiscal officer, Sal D. Rinella will leave in October 
to become president of Austin Peay State University of Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 Rinella, 47, said he was attracted to his new job because Austin Peay is 
facing challenges that Cal State Fullerton already has met. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton recently completed a new science and new university center 
buildings. Austin Peay plans to do the same, Rinella said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, "Austin Peay wants to expand partnerships with its local 
community and businesses," said Rinella, who is responsible for Cal State 
Fullerton's $200-million operating, capital and auxiliary budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 He led the effort that brought the $10.2-million sports complex and the 
$16-million hotel and conference center on campus in an innovative joint 
venture between the university, the city of Fullerton and the Marriott Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Rinella is responsible for a budgeting system that has been praised by other 
university officials, including President Milton A. Gordon, for "giving the 
campus the capability to conduct reliable financial planning." 
</P>
<P>
 Rinella begins his new job Oct. 20. A reception in his honor will be held on 
campus Oct. 3, and his last day at Cal State Fullerton will be Oct. 14. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; CITY REJECTS OWNER'S APPEAL TO KEEP SIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An appeal by a liquor store owner to save a 32-foot-tall sign has been 
rejected by the City Council 
</P>
<P>
 Because the sign existed before the city sign ordinance was passed in 1990, 
property owner Robert Maurer argued, it should not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurer will be given three years to take down the sign, which bears the simple 
message: "Liquor." 
</P>
<P>
 Another 18-foot sign on the same property must be down within two years, the 
council said. A third sign, 11 feet tall, must be taken down by December. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadlines were based on the value of the signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said the pole sign ordinance was necessary to maintain the 
aesthetics of Mission Viejo, and the city law is being applied equally to all 
merchants, including Maurer. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; COLLEGES TO TARGET KINDERGARTNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 When 2,000 kindergartners converged on the Rancho Santiago College campus 
March 31 as part of an event to inspire youths to strive for a higher 
education, other college campuses took note. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, KinderCaminata, will be duplicated at Fullerton and Golden West 
colleges.Officials at both institutions said they too want the youngest 
elementary-school children to begin thinking about a college degree and 
professional job as early as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Families and educators who attended or heard of the first KinderCaminata are 
still talking about it, organizers of the event said. It was created and 
organized by Los Amigos of Orange County, a group that promotes Latino 
empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 people, including college employees and presidents, teachers, 
parents, students, school district trustees and a representative of the Mexican 
Consulate, last week watched a 25-minute documentary on KinderCaminata, which 
took place on the birthday of the late labor leader Cesar Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 The film focused on the children, who participated in a half-kilometer walk 
chanting "Si se puede" (yes it can be done) and learned about professions to 
consider. The purpose of the event is to emphasize that a college education is 
within any child's reach and to instill a sense of the importance of education.

MAYOR, JUDGE AT ODDS OVER CURFEW ENFORCEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's teen-age domain is malls and outdoor shopping centers, where 
skateboarders rule and other teens just hang out. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants complain about being surrogate baby-sitters, about vandalism and 
shopper intimidation caused by loitering teen-agers. The kids complain too, 
echoing a familiar refrain of nowhere to go, nothing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, Mission Viejo officials have taken action against teen 
loitering, passing an anti-skateboarding law and issuing citations for curfew 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, the curfew problem has sparked a brief and pointed war of words 
between city officials and the county Juvenile Court system. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Mission Viejo Mayor Susan Withrow wrote county Dist. Atty. Michael 
R. Capizzi, claiming juvenile courts were routinely dismissing curfew cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am asking for your assistance in making sure the court does not dismiss 
these cases," she wrote. "If that is, or has been the case . . . then the 
people we serve need to know it." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter was passed along to presiding Juvenile Court Judge Frank Fasel, 
whose response was swift and vehement. 
</P>
<P>
 Fasel replied to Withrow: 
</P>
<P>
 "I find these unfounded and unsubstantiated conclusions to be professionally 
insulting," Fasel said in his letter. "In the future, I suggest you be more 
certain about your information before making reckless and unfounded 
representations." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Fasel, 40 Mission Viejo curfew citations were heard by the 
Juvenile Court from February through June. Only one case was dismissed, 
according to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please keep in mind that this is a court of law and not a rubber stamp for 
the Sheriff's Department and the city of Mission Viejo," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor remains convinced that too many cases are being dismissed, and she 
thinks the judge's response was an overreaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been dissatisfied with what we feel is a significant number of cases 
being dismissed," Withrow said. "We're simply trying to better the situation. I 
really feel the whole thing has been blown out of proportion." 
</P>
<P>
 Fasel could not be reached for direct comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Randy Blair, who heads Mission Viejo's police services, said his agency 
has not kept figures of dismissed curfew citations, but he indicated there have 
been "several" in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although several strip malls have reported curfew problems, most of the 
complaints center on two adjacent outdoor shopping centers, Portola Plaza and 
Trabuco Hills Center, according to city officials and local business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair said the area has drawn some gang and drug activity. Large groups of 
teen-agers also exert a scary, physical presence that intimidates shoppers and 
merchants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has been trying to control the situation in the shopping centers in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 When a Taco Bell became a hangout, city officials negotiated with management 
to stop a free drink refill policy. And when business owners in the centers 
began seeing a rise in skateboarders, the city passed its anti-skateboarding 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've tried to push us out, for sure," said Tim Wilson, 17, standing in 
front of Long's Drug Store. "But it won't work because there's nothing for us 
to do in this place." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and community members have formed a group of all ages that 
hopes to convert a city recreation building into a teen center by next year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, some parents say the net thrown out by police has caught 
innocent teen-agers engaged in normal activities. 
</P>
<P>
 James P. Santagata filed a claim against the city in March, alleging his son, 
Brian, has been wrongfully cited issued a citation twice in the past 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair said he was unable to comment on the case because of Santagata's pending 
claim.  
</P>
<P>
 However, Withrow believes that Mission Viejo youths engaged in innocent 
activities are not being cited unfairly by police. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only a small percentage of kids in that situation get caught," she said. "The 
(curfew) law is not designed to imprison them in their home and we're not 
enforcing it that way."

YOUTH SHOT AFTER 2 GROUPS ARGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 17-year-old Monterey Park boy was shot after an argument between two groups 
of youths Saturday night at a fast-food restaurant, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, who was not identified because of his age, was listed in stable 
condition after surgery Sunday with a gunshot wound to his upper thigh, said 
Sgt. Kevin McKeown of the Fountain Valley Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 His wound is not expected to be life threatening, McKeown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was shot at about 11 p.m. after he and a group of friends left the 
Family Fun Center in the 9000 block of Recreation Circle and walked across the 
street to Tommy's Hamburgers, McKeown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four young males in a car approached the group and one of them opened fire 
with a handgun before fleeing north on Magnolia Avenue, McKeown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The wounded youth and his friends ran back across the street and he collapsed 
in the parking lot of the Fun Center, McKeown said. The incident is under 
investigation and police have asked any witnesses to the shooting to call the 
Police Department at (714) 965-4400.

PISTOL-WHIPPING, GUNSHOTS DISRUPT PARTY IN CYPRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 20-year-old man from Long Beach was pistol-whipped and shots were fired 
after an argument broke out at a "flyer party" at a home on Ethel Street, 
police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrived at the home in the 10300 block of Ethel Street at 10:16 p.m. 
Saturday after receiving more than 30 emergency 911 calls prompted by the 
gunshots, said Sgt. John Avila of the Cypress Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently no one was hit by the gunshots, but the Long Beach man, whom police 
did not identify, was taken to Los Alamitos Medical Center for treatment, Avila 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that about 100 people, mostly juveniles, attended the 
party and that the argument started in the back yard. Someone opened fire with 
a 9-millimeter handgun and at least one parked car was hit by a bullet, Avila 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are looking for two male juveniles, possibly gang members, in 
connection with the incident, Avila said.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: TROUPE GETS ACT TOGETHER TO HELP BATTERED WOMEN'S HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the five women performing the upcoming two-act comedy "The Wives," the 
play's the thing, but not the only thing. 
</P>
<P>
 They like running their own production and are using some of the profits to 
benefit Haven Hills, a Valley-based home for victims of family violence. 
</P>
<P>
 These are actresses who are not content to wait passively for a casting call 
and a chance at stardom.  
</P>
<P>
 The venue is the elegant Ventura Court Theatre in Studio City, where benefit 
dinners will be presented Sept. 9 and 10. The food will be prepared by Andrea 
Rogantini, executive chef Prego restaurant in Beverly Hills. The performances 
will follow the meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost of each of the two dinner shows is $35. Other performances -- scheduled 
for a four-week run, Thursdays through Sundays, beginning Sept. 8 -- are $15 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Wives" was written by one of the actresses, Rosie Taravella, who is also 
executive producer. It is a story of five women who are thrown together through 
their buddy-buddy husbands. 
</P>
<P>
 The five actresses, unlike their fictional counterparts, had no trouble 
bonding after meeting more than a year ago in acting classes given by Charles 
Nelson Reilly in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Taravella are stuntwoman and actress Patricia Tallman; Christy 
Noonan, who has done commercials and episodic television; actress-writer 
Kendall Hailey; and Erin McLaughlin, an actress who as appeared in several 
television sitcoms, Taravella says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to work together, have become friends. We always sit together in 
Charles' classes, sort of like high school," Taravella says. 
</P>
<P>
 Taravella developed a working script in three months, her writing pace 
interrupted only by her May 27 wedding to fellow writer Mike Valerio. 
</P>
<P>
 The women are all thirtysomething and have dubbed their new company Broads on 
the Boards Productions. Their first coup: talking Reilly into directing. 
</P>
<P>
 Taravella, who put up her own money to cover initial production costs, says 
the group had to wait for Reilly to finish directing a Julie Andrews project 
back East before he could begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all in awe of Charles because he is so multitalented. He seems to be 
equally at home teaching classes, directing operas or appearing on television 
game shows," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Taravella chose Haven Hills as the beneficiary because the cause struck close 
to home for her. "I've had some firsthand experience with family violence," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mother's time, there was nowhere for women to go when this happened. 
There was also a sense of shame, on the part of the victims, which is really 
like being victimized twice," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are happy to be doing our part to support a facility that offers shelters 
to battered women, one that supports them while helping to sustain their 
dignity," Taravella says. Pump Up the Music: It's Full Volume Here 
</P>
<P>
 Pulling into the Unocal 76 service station at the corner of Fulton Avenue and 
Moorpark Street is like driving into a '50s movie about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars and props look '90s, but something strange is going on here. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the owner giving candy to kids. Service manager, Dan, calls his 
customers by name. 
</P>
<P>
 Classical music is piped into the service bays. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendants give out roses on Mother's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't there some kind of law about unfair competition? 
</P>
<P>
 Hasn't anyone told these people about the in-your-face school of retailing? 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of scam are these people running here? 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry. 
</P>
<P>
 They just haven't gotten the memo about the fall of polite civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 Seems that owner Ron Mathews, 38, really doesn't know any better. This is the 
way he's been taught to deal with customers ever since he was 6 and used to 
come here with his dad and put the oil can to everything in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Jack Mathews, started the station in 1960, when people were 
neighborly and everyone knew the corner gas station owner, Ron says. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite shifts in corporate identity and merchandising miseries, the modus 
operandi for this full-service station has remained unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Service always worked for us, so we saw no reason to change that. It doesn't 
cost that much more, and it promotes customer loyalty," says Mathews, pointing 
out that customers who have moved to Beverly Hills and Palm Springs come back 
for service. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews knows he's bucking the current trend of streamlining customer service 
to the robotic side of impersonalization. But, he says, "we pump a lot of gas, 
which is how we've survived as an independent for as long as we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime customer Steve Pepper of Sherman Oaks says he can vouch for the 
customer loyalty, adding that at Christmas the place looks like a gift drop. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews, who took over the station when his father retired, says his customers 
have given him some expensive toys. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his most memorable: two snowmobiles. He wasn't sure what he would do 
with them, until he learned that use of the customer's Mammoth Lakes lodge was 
part of the gift. Overheard: 
</P>
<P>
 "I came home the other day and found my mother and her friend rolling on the 
floor, gasping for breath and laughing so hard they had the hiccups. I was 
worried until I realized they were watching her tapes of 'Ab Fab.' I think that 
program is dangerous for women her age." 
</P>
<P>

set's fave rave, "Absolutely Fabulous," a contemporary TV comedy shown

2 MURDER SUSPECTS FLEE AFTER FOILED ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men wanted for questioning in a murderous crime spree remained at large 
Sunday, a day after they shot at a man during a bungled purse snatching at a 
Huntington Beach supermarket, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The men, described as about 30 years old, are suspects in at least two 
killings, two auto thefts and a house burglary in addition to the purse 
snatching, according to authorities in Arizona and Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 They were last seen in Huntington Beach Saturday night speeding away from the 
bungled robbery in a 1989 silver and blue Dodge Ram Charger with Arizona 
license plate LBV044, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6:35 p.m. Saturday, one of the suspects -- wearing a red baseball cap -- 
snatched a purse from a woman's shopping cart in the Hughes Market on Algonquin 
Street and ran out of the store, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness, a 40-year-old Huntington Beach man, ran after the man, who dropped 
the purse but fired three shots with a pistol before driving off in the Ram 
Charger with his accomplice, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The local man was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracing the Ram Charger has led police to suspect the men might have been 
involved in several other serious crimes over the past few days. The Ram 
Charger was stolen sometime either early Saturday or Friday from murder victims 
Joseph and Charlene Babcock, who lived in a rural home about 20 miles east of 
Kingman, Ariz., authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Babcocks were shot in the head, said Kay Claborn, a dispatcher with the 
Mohave County Sheriff's Department. Charlene Babcock was found inside her home, 
her husband outside in a wash on rural Silver Springs Road, about 3 1/2 miles 
north of Interstate 40, Claborn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe Joseph Babcock had stopped to help the two suspects, whose car 
had run aground in the wash, and was later shot, Claborn said. The suspects 
then apparently drove the Ram Charger to the Babcock home where they shot 
Charlene Babcock and burglarized another home nearby, Claborn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police found Joseph Babcock about 8 a.m. Saturday lying next to the suspects' 
grounded vehicle, a 1994 Dodge listed as stolen from Missouri, Claborn said. 
The owner of the stolen Dodge is also missing. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the suspects is listed as 6 feet 2 inches tall with a thin beard and 
mustache. The other is thin with a "transient-like" appearance, police said. 
Both are white.

BOBBY LYLE LIVE: ANOTHER STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In performance, at least, Bobby Lyle still has the right balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle's newest album release, "Rhythm Stories," is gussied up with a bevy of 
heavy-hitting fusioneers, including bassists Stanley Clarke and Marcus Miller, 
saxophonists Gerald Albright and Everett Harp and guitarist Paul Jackson Jr. It 
concentrates, as the name implies, on the beat, with accessible hip-hop tunes 
and a couple of Stevie Wonder covers. It's a product more concerned with sales 
than with artistic achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lyle's appearance Friday at the Hyatt Newporter was nothing like that 
commercially minded effort. Mixing a variety of forms, Lyle showed why he's the 
thinking-person's jazz fusion artist in a set that was as smart as it was fun. 
</P>
<P>
 The live-performance Lyle doesn't lean too far in any direction as he combines 
contemporary beats and instrumentation with straight-ahead sensibilities. While 
most of today's crossover artists rely too heavily on the rock side of the 
jazz-rock medium, Lyle lures his listeners with accessible rhythms that bring 
depth and meaning, not to mention fine musicianship, into his heady mix. 
</P>
<P>
 With a small synthesizer perched on top of his grand piano Friday, Lyle 
presented a tonally smart blend of acoustic and electronic sounds, soloing in 
detail on the 88s here, providing funky, electric sounds there. Occasionally he 
would use both in intriguing call-and-response fashion, answering ambitious 
acoustic runs with tinkling accents from the synthesizer. 
</P>
<P>
 He chose "Exotic Love," one of the sultrier pieces from "Rhythm Stories," to 
represent the album. With Cal Bennett stating the theme on soprano saxophone, 
Lyle provided first steel drum-like, then string-sounding tones from the 
synthesizer for accompaniment, then switched to sweeping chordal statements as 
Bennett's improvisation climaxed. During his own improv, Lyle stuck to 
acoustic, building on a rotation of locked-hand figures to an intense statement 
worthy of McCoy Tyner. To close, he returned to the electric keyboard and 
echoed the steel drum introduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he didn't forget his roots, working solo on Billy Strayhorn's "Lush 
Life" in an acoustic effort that was rich with detail. This was followed by an 
involved bebop-inspired tribute to Dexter Gordon ("Blues for Dexter") that 
contained some stately stride piano touches. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, both pieces, as well as his signature "Ivory Dreams," were marred by 
the chop of a police helicopter circling close to the outdoor venue, prompting 
Lyle to wonder aloud if he should wait for it to leave before continuing. 
"Sounds like South Central," someone yelled from the crowd. "South Central? 
Brother, you're a long way from home," Lyle quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 (Newport Beach police were called to the hotel Friday to help disperse a 
crowd, estimated by Hyatt Newporter officials at more than 600, that had 
gathered for the premiere of a surf-snowboard action film and a scheduled 
appearance by three rock bands.) 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the distraction, the keyboardist's set was a sterling example of what 
fusion should be: accessible but intelligent, melodic yet detailed. Here's 
hoping that Lyle's recorded work will return to that form. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, opening act the B Sharp Jazz Quartet improved on tunes pulled 
mostly from its impressive, eponymously titled release. The acoustic foursome 
made a strong impression with fine individual efforts that melded into a whole 
even greater than its parts. 
</P>
<P>
 B Sharp extends the mainstream tradition with tunes that feature a tight 
rhythmic base and components that complement rather than go their own way. The 
group opened with John Coltrane's "Blue Trane" before moving through an 
impressive array of originals, notably pianist Eliot Douglass' "Panacea," 
bassist Reggie Carson's quirky "Analytical Cubism" and an ambitious work penned 
by saxophonist Randall Willis and drummer Herb Graham Jr. dubbed "Hoopty." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglass' blues and bop excursions were particularly satisfying, often 
developing from spare, wispy lines into full-blown chordal onslaughts. Drummer 
Graham offered fine accents to the tunes while building his attack 
proportionately to a soloist's degree of intensity. Saxophonist Willis, showing 
chops on tenor, alto and soprano, avoided the sometimes overly repetitious 
formula he used on the album, instead attacking each tune with a varied bag of 
color and ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath it all, solid as a concrete fence post, was bassist Carson, whose 
every note seemed designed to fit perfectly into the overall musical scheme. 
That's B Sharp's greatest strength -- that it arrives at one sound, rather than 
four approaches working at cross-purposes.

JAZZ REVIEWS; ISHAM SCORES OFF-SCREEN TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Composer Mark Isham has amassed a list of movie soundtracks impressive in both 
size and scope. It includes the sultry backdrop for director Alan Rudolph's 
"The Moderns"; considered, orchestral pieces for "A River Runs Through It" 
(nominated for an Academy Award and a Grammy); industrial-strength, techno-beat 
moods for Hilary Henkin's recent film noir adventure "Romeo Is Bleeding," and 
jazz-era swing and ballad sounds designed for Robert Redford's upcoming "Quiz 
Show." All feature Isham's trumpet playing. 
</P>
<P>
 So what does Isham do to relax? He gets together with friends, as he did 
Saturday at Randell's, and plays jazz. Concentrating on standards, the 
trumpeter-fluegelhornist showed that writing music for the big screen isn't his 
only talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Isham, who has appeared infrequently in Los Angeles clubs over the past 
several years and has released a handful of albums under his own name, began as 
an economically melodic player. But he has expanded his skills to the point 
where he now recalls the aggressiveness of a young Freddie Hubbard, the 
off-beat witticism of the late Lee Morgan and the bop ambition of Clifford 
Brown. There's some of Miles Davis' lyrical emotion in his playing, but 
delivered in cleaner fashion. Put them all together and you have one impressive 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
 On Herbie Hancock's "Dolphin Dance," Isham's transparent tonal quality and 
sensitive delivery recalled veteran fluegel man Johnny Coles' many outings with 
Hancock. His work on "How Long Has This Been Going On?" was sweet, 
thought-provoking and sounded over a wide tonal range. Playing trumpet on the 
be-bop classic "Au Privave," he scatted with strength and agility, often 
squeezing off notes in the upper register as he completed a particularly 
ambitious phrase. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though all these tunes are well-worn, Isham's combo brought fresh, 
contemporary colors to them, thanks especially to Chick Corea drummer Gary 
Novak and guitarist Steve Cardenas. Novak's insistent, hard-hitting attack gave 
everything a modern slant, while Cardenas' spare, singing accompaniment and 
pointed soloing supplied doses of mystery and hard reality. 
</P>
<P>
 As Cardenas' electricity gave the show an edge, bassist Jeff Littleton's 
acoustic bass gave it a traditional anchor with firm rhythmic and melodic 
touches. He was especially impressive during "Au Privave," taking a solo that 
walked quickly and without pause through a constantly changing landscape of 
phrases. 
</P>
<P>
 Saxophonist Steve Tavaglione's tone on soprano gave a polished, honey-colored 
flavor to everything it touched. On tenor for "Dolphin Dance," Tavaglione 
employed quiet volumes to make his statements, recalling Joe Henderson's more 
understated efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the least familiar numbers was one of the best: saxophonist Charles 
Lloyd's "The Song My Lady Sings" (Isham worked with Lloyd in the '70s). Playing 
fluegel, Isham was particularly warm and heartfelt, while Tavaglione employed 
flute for a brief, dance-like solo and some cleanly sounded unison play with 
Isham. 
</P>
<P>
 At the close of the set, Novak set up a rollicking, Latin-feel pace that saw 
him employing the entirety of his drum set as the other musicians traded 
anything-you-can-do-I-can-do-better lines. Then, with the pace unabated, the 
group sounded the theme to "Old Devil Moon" at a tempo -- arranged by another 
old Isham crony, saxophonist Dave Liebman -- that would give Tony Bennett a 
coronary. There were fine solos all around before Isham cooled the tune with 
some lines reminiscent of the Miles Davis-Gil Evans "Sketches of Spain" session 
and brought it to an end. You might say it was an Oscar-worthy performance.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; AMOS EARNS DIVA WINGS, SUPPLIES OWN HALO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The traditional singer-songwriter was a species that thrived in the '60s and 
'70s but has been threatened in the '90s by a musical environment gone all 
grungy. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, like salmon spawn, they keep hatching, and good albums by '90s-vintage 
arrivals such as Vinnie James, Ben Harper, Archie Roach, Sheryl Crow, Lisa 
Germano and Freedy Johnston suggest that the breed hasn't lost its grace, its 
commitment or its intelligence. But with noise-rock ringing the register among 
most younger fans, will these newest heirs to Dylan, Newman, Mitchell, et al be 
hardy enough to make the swim upstream to long-term survival? 
</P>
<P>
 Tori Amos is one '90s singer-songwriter who is getting on swimmingly. Her 1991 
debut album, "Little Earthquakes," went gold, and so has this year's follow-up, 
"Under the Pink." Not only did she sell out UC Irvine's Crawford Hall on 
Saturday, but the humid little gymnasium, more fit in summer for growing 
tropical flowers than for staging pop concerts, rang out with ovations and 
intrusive, mid-song cries of adoration. 
</P>
<P>
 Amos, 31, seems well equipped for survival in today's marketplace. Far from 
being a modest, unassuming songsmith, her appeal rests on a diva's commanding 
voice and a diva's intense, spotlight-grabbing, somewhat pretentious bearing 
(her show's well-conceived, frequently arresting stage lighting typically 
vested the beatific star in a full-body halo).  
</P>
<P>
 The jarring dynamics that became a staple for Nirvana and other popular 
full-on rockers have their parallel in Amos' shows, even though she plays as a 
soloist, self-accompanied on an acoustic grand piano. Many songs in her 
90-minute set found her rising from delicate reveries to keening, tortured 
cries and back to dramatic whispers. 
</P>
<P>
 Amos also has a theme that's ripe for '90s consumption: the struggle for 
empowerment. She is too ambitious an artist to address this pop-psychology 
concept in bland, psychobabble lingo. Still, what you get in Amos' lyrics are 
fragmentary glimpses of characters struggling to don the vestments of full 
personhood. They confront crippling self-doubts and murmur to themselves in the 
aftermath of relationships in which they have been treated or, worse, allowed 
themselves to be treated, as inferiors.  
</P>
<P>
 Then there's "Me and a Gun," Amos' memorable, first-person account of a rape 
in which the victim, stripped of all power but the power over her own thoughts, 
is seen playing whatever mental tricks she can to hold onto a sense of self and 
a will to live through the violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Having found an audience, the question now is whether Amos knows what to do 
with it. "Under the Pink" shows alarming signs that it may be going to her 
head. While the album is by no means a washout, it ends on a terribly sour 
note, with empty songs like "Cloud on My Tongue," "Space Dog" and the bloated 
blather of the 9 1/2-minute "Yes, Anastasia." These fail to register even 
fragmentary meaning; they are purely inscrutable, suggesting either that Amos 
lacked the songwriting stamina to finish off her second album, or that she has 
become so full of herself that she thinks an audience will swallow anything she 
sings, so long as it comes couched in that intensity, carried by that voice. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, if Amos as commodity looks well-established, the jury was still out 
on Amos as artist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even to a skeptic, the show at Crawford Hall offered powerful testimony in her 
favor. She cropped out all the empty filler from "Under the Pink," choosing six 
substantive songs from it. (Well, "Cornflake Girl" is as inscrutable as she 
gets, but the song worked on the strength of its musical drama. Amos' darting, 
classically informed piano sallies gave it a sense of freedom and 
unpredictability that allowed her to get away with the questionable ploy of 
performing it to a canned backing track culled from the album. "God," the only 
other song using similarly prepackaged ingredients, didn't fare as well.) 
</P>
<P>
 Over a long closing stretch that encompassed nearly half the concert, Amos 
earned the right to a diva's pretensions by doing what divas are supposed to 
do: She created a sustained, unbroken, fully involving moment of heightened 
passion. It was an unsparing sequence, filled with songs of deep sadness and 
loss, starting with "Bells for Her," which she played on an upright piano 
rigged to produce the delicate, hollow-ringing sounds of Chinese bells. 
</P>
<P>
 The a cappella "Me and a Gun" was next -- a song as unsparing as they come. 
Conventional concertizing would call for an eventual upward reach after that, 
moving from the song's stark depths toward an eventual affirmation later in the 
show. But Amos, who had played her few humorous, music-hallish cards early in 
the concert ("Leather," "Happy Phantom," "The Waitress"), continued to survey 
inner damage on the next song, the set-closing "Baker, Baker." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Through three encores, she kept the momentum going. A luminous cover of Stevie 
Nicks' Fleetwood Mac-vintage ballad, "Landslide," was the closest she came to 
affirmation, but it was only an affirmation of the will to endure loss. 
"Winter," one of her loveliest songs, came next, with its glimpse of a father's 
desperately impatient attempt to get through to an apparently depressive 
daughter.  
</P>
<P>
 Encore three was a haunting meditation on the dismal side of rock history, 
linking Buddy Holly's accidental death with Kurt Cobain's self-inflicted one. 
Amos, a minister's daughter who loves waxing ironic about Christian 
iconography, began with the quietly ironic fragment of Don McLean's "American 
Pie" in which "the three men I admire most, the Father, Son and the Holy Ghost" 
are seen giving up their own faith on "the day the music died." Then, with 
spectral circles of light swirling about her, she moved into a ghostly reading 
of Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit," giving poor Cobain the only thing in 
anyone's power to give: a properly mournful wake in which his own sad music was 
kept alive. This grieving show-closer was far from an affirmation, but it was 
something more than a denial. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, a memorable display of power, depth, taste and thoughtful linkages of 
meaning consistent with a real contender, rather than a lucky diva of the hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Amos' handpicked opening act, Bill Miller, is a Native American from 
Wisconsin. His message was both anguished and stirring. His songs lamented the 
historic disaster that befell his people, and in "Trail of Freedom" he didn't 
flinch from reporting on such lingering effects as the widespread alcoholism 
among Native Americans. But the songs, drawn mainly from Miller's major-label 
debut, "The Red Road," also carried the conviction that the story isn't over. 
He envisioned a rebirth of Native American culture, founded on enduring 
spiritual values and a tenacious national character. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly nothing in his fervent, kinetic, hard-strumming performance would 
belie that message. Backed by Hans Mayer, a capable bass and mandolin player, 
the sturdy-voiced Miller offered familiarly structured folk-rock anthems and 
laments geared for the mainstream, but also injected traditional strains with 
bracing tribal chants and a haunting flute air. His raw but focused music, full 
of driving, elemental acoustic guitar solos, had far more clout live than on 
his comparatively tame album. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was personable, inserting musical jokes to set the audience at ease 
(although a brief, laugh-drawing interlude from "Stairway to Heaven" was out of 
place in the middle of his powerful prayer-song, "Praises"). The only thing you 
could really fault him for was a tenuous grip on Orange County surf-rock 
history: introducing a wryly conceived acoustic version of "Pipeline," which he 
said was one of the first songs he learned as a kid, he described the Chantays 
original as a Ventures tune. On the other hand, we'd hate to face a pop quiz on 
the history of Miller's tribe, the Mohicans. 
</P>
<P>
 The sound in Crawford Hall, where punk and alternative bands go to drown in 
acoustic murk, was adequate for Amos and Miller. The gym, set up for reserved 
seating, was far more hospitable with chairs on the floor in lieu of the 
customary mosh pit. But the muggy heat was awful. There must be a better place 
in Orange County for serious, singer-songwriter-type acts with a draw of 2,000 
to 4,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the Orange County Performing Arts Center will one day see fit to work 
with established rock promoters on this sort of show; the politics of the pop 
concert industry make it very unlikely that OCPAC can program contemporary 
artists such as Amos on its own. Another possibility is the dormant Pacific 
Amphitheatre. Under Nederlander, its former operator, the Pacific proved itself 
a fine venue for scaled-down shows by such theater-level performers as Tracy 
Chapman, Carole King, Bruce Hornsby, the Chieftains and an acoustic Neil Young. 
The Orange County Fair, which now controls the Pacific, would be doing a public 
service by resuming those smaller-scale, won't-disturb-the-neighbors shows at 
the amphitheater.

THE MUSIC MOVES HIM; AT HIS TRAVELING DANCE PARTIES, DJ DION GRANT PUMPS UP THE 
VOLUME -- AND, HE HOPES STUDENTMORALE. HE WANTS TO SHOW KIDS THAT SCHOOL 
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A DOWNER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As a teen-ager, Dion Grant looked forward to weekly school dances, saving his 
favorite trousers and shirt for the gym parties. Today, at 48, Grant still 
joins the kids on the dance floor, proving he can move with the best of 'em.  
</P>
<P>
 "Nowadays, these kinds of activities don't happen as much," Grant says of the 
booming Banda music that sends Crozier Middle School students, and principal 
Jerrie Martin, into a quebradita Latin dance frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of kids don't want to stay even a minute longer at school than they 
need to," Grant says, which is why he started the KDION Radio program, a 
traveling dance party complete with sound system, record library and simulated 
radio broadcast handled by students. 
</P>
<P>
 The parties are Grant's attempt to "reinforce the notion to kids that school 
is not a place to be bored, not a downer place." 
</P>
<P>
 For certain, on this sweltering afternoon, Crozier is the coolest place in 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Student Council President Veronica Guzman, 13, who wants to be an astronaut, 
welcomes the students as Robert Douglas, also 13, in an Ohio State Buckeyes 
T-shirt hanging to his knees, alternates between spinning records and playing 
CDs. He takes his cues from student emcees, who read a script written by Grant 
and his staff from the School Entertainment and Activities Program, or SEAP. 
Grant launched the Los Angeles-based youth-marketing firm in 1974. The goal: to 
boost students' morale. 
</P>
<P>
 At the microphone before a packed room is Ahmid Kabba, 14, who would like to 
be a professional disc jockey. He clears his voice and then, with gusto, leads 
his classmates in a Crozier pep rally, spelling out his school's letters, each 
one resoundingly repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell me, is Crozier No. 1?" he shouts. A deafening "No. 1!" is the response. 
"Word!" concludes Kabba. Douglas starts Arrested Development's "Ease My Mind" 
as students hit the floor in hip-hop gyrations. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next hour, the music is interspersed with messages from Grant over the 
microphone "to keep graffiti off the walls, keep your campuses clean, respect 
your teachers and have fun." 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me hear you say, 'happiness,' " Grant encourages the crowd in his disc 
jockey voice. And no one is happier than Grant -- the father of five children 
ranging in age from 7 to 24 -- who is surrounded by young people vying for his 
attention and a chance at the music controls or behind the mike. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the kids hear that Dion is here, it's like saying Santa is coming," says 
Marcia Hazelton, Crozier assistant principal. "I've been here 17 years and 
there's no program that compares to his. He uses a unique motivational 
technique to get kids to see that school is a positive place to be. He uses 
music, the universal language." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Texarkana, Tex., Grant was about 10 when he moved to Los Angeles 
during the civil rights movement to live with his grandmother. He threw himself 
into studying and graduated from Dorsey High School, attended Cal State L.A. 
and then was drafted. In 1968, after a stint with the Army in Vietnam, he 
returned to Los Angeles and pursued his love for music -- collecting it and 
getting paid to play it at parties. 
</P>
<P>
 During the disco era, Grant worked as a consultant to club owners and was an 
original member of the Southern California Disco Assn. "As a live disc jockey I 
played for some of the largest crowds and headlined weekend shows," he recalls. 
Today, his reputation as the ultimate record-spinner -- and his knack for 
getting people to dance -- has earned him the title of "Bar and Bat Mitzvah 
King" on the local party circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, Grant visited Dorsey High to see some of his old teachers. He was 
stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were guards at the doors. There were pimps outside the school and guys 
selling drugs on the street. It blew me away." 
</P>
<P>
 He talked to some students. "I asked the kids, 'What's wrong? Why is this 
happening?' They told me they were bored. So for the next two years I was on 
and off campuses from Dorsey to Beverly Hills, talking to kids who all told me 
the same thing: They were bored and turning to drugs and alcohol, leaving 
campuses in droves because nobody wanted to be there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew the power of music. I said, 'Why not put something together using 
music to influence kids, to keep the kids coming to school?' When I was a 
student I remember how schools were the social centers. Schools were there for 
the kids and their friends. It was our home away from home." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the students, Grant began SEAP, a profit-making venture working 
with record companies and artists looking to boost new music and musical acts 
to the teen market.  
</P>
<P>
 A highlight of the free concerts and radio show at schools -- which now number 
more than 75 in Los Angeles and Orange counties -- are certificates given to 
students as selected by teachers for good attendance, behavior and citizenship, 
and academic achievement and work habits. "I'm not a teacher, but what I can do 
is give teachers a hand with motivating the kids," Grant says of the incentives 
and activities, which "don't cost taxpayers and the school any money." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you what I am," he says. "I'm a dreamer and I want kids to be 
dreamers, too, to dream that they can achieve and excel because they are good 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Come Sept. 30, Grant hopes that a dream he has had for the last 12 years will 
come true. That's when his biggest endeavor to date, a concert for 17,000 
recent elementary, middle school and high school graduates and parents billed 
as the "GO" (Graduates Only) show, is scheduled to take place at the Los 
Angeles Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Rap, reggae, Latin and rock acts are being lined up. Potential businesses are 
being sought as sponsors. Politicians -- up to and including President Clinton 
-- have been invited to speak, either in person or via satellite. (As of 
Friday, Clinton hadn't responded.) 
</P>
<P>
 "For 12 years I've been wanting to do something like this," he says of the 
planned concert, which was fueled by Clinton's state of the union address and 
his challenge for citizens to come up with ideas to keep kids in school. 
</P>
<P>
 But with or without the President, the show will go on, he says. The word on 
the concert is out and "there are too many kids that we can't let down."

PLATONIC PLUS; HE'S CHUMMY YET FLIRTY, TOUCHY YET DISTANT; HE'S A LITE LOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIZ BRODY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Every morning, shortly after 9, Deborah Fluker's office phone would ring. It 
was always the hunk of a runway model she'd met in a costume store, asking if 
she'd gotten to work OK. 
</P>
<P>
 Later she'd call him back to find out what he wanted for dinner, wondering if 
he'd surprise her with some silly trinket or card to add to those that already 
cluttered her Manhattan apartment. Chances are, they'd spend the evening 
falling asleep cuddled up in front of the TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Trinkets, costumes, cards, cuddling -- evidence of a young couple in love. But 
cuddling was as far as it progressed, much to Fluker's bewilderment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did a lot of touching, dropped popcorn into each other's mouths, held 
hands walking down the street -- physically intimate things I would never do 
with a friend," said Fluker, a 36-year-old market research consultant who grew 
increasingly frustrated as the months went by. Did he just not find her 
attractive? Was he gay? "He told me, 'No. I don't want to have sex now because 
it always messes everything up and I want you in my life forever,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 He's one of a new breed of single, heterosexual males that might be called the 
"lite lover" -- flirtatious yet chummy, physical yet platonic, possessive yet 
stalwartly uncommitted as he navigates that swampy gray area between romance 
and friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mama never told me about this kind of guy," Fluker complained. "She said, 
'Watch out for the wolf or the man who's too nice.' I had to go to therapy over 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an increasing trend," said David Eyler, who co-authored, with 
Andrea Baridon, "More Than Friends, Less Than Lovers" (Jeremy Tarcher, 1991). 
Considering the growing number of women in the workplace, Eyler sees "lite 
love" as a necessary alternative to the office affair. "We've always had the 
platonic relationship; this is the platonic plus. We're not talking about the 
blotto, can't-keep-your-hands-off-each-other kind of chemistry. You start out 
with a resistible attraction and that's key." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthropologist Helen Fisher, author of "Anatomy of Love" (Fawcett Columbine, 
1992), said the trend transcends the business setting. "I've certainly seen a 
lot of this," said Fisher, also a research associate in the anthropology 
department at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. "There's so 
much turnover these days, people are finding something that's comfortable while 
looking for the next true love. . . . Sex complicates relationships." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But why, some women wonder, are men all of a sudden paying so much attention 
to "complications"? Fear of AIDS is a factor, experts say, but only in a small 
percentage of cases. Is it that so many women are running with the wolves, men 
are running for cover? 
</P>
<P>
 Getting warmer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men, deep down, feel confused," said Dr. Mark Goulston, assistant clinical 
professor of psychiatry at UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute and 
founder/president of Direct Conflict Resolution Group. "They hear the 'don't, 
don't, don't' and in an effort not to be aggressive, they often throw passion 
out with the bath water." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly in the recent decades of sexual integration -- at the office and 
school, in music and sports -- men have been learning to see women as 
colleagues as opposed to conquests. And in the process, they're doing some 
soul-searching about their own relationships, trying to be more intimate with 
people in general without depending on sex as the bonding agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wouldn't you know it," said Playboy magazine's James Petersen. "Guys finally 
figure out what women want and it scares (women) to death." 
</P>
<P>
 From his vantage point as "the Playboy Advisor," columnist Petersen adds with 
irony that women are missing the very renegade lust of men that they've been 
criticizing for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But if lite love is fabulously PC, its G-rating may take some getting used to. 
In the meantime, many women are still reeling from rejection. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has thrown me for such a loop," said Cathy Harris, 36, a Los Angeles 
writer, after six months of spending affectionate evenings with Scott, a 
good-looking 40-year-old. "Growing up Catholic, the nuns all drummed into me 
that, with the exception of your husband, men don't like you if they want to go 
to bed with you. Now that I've met one who doesn't, I'm thinking: What's wrong 
with me? Aren't I pretty, smart or sexy enough?" 
</P>
<P>
 Scott is mystified too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have an answer for it," he said. "Cathy is an oasis in this city. 
She's not only beautiful and intelligent, but there isn't anything we can't 
discuss. . . . You ask yourself, 'Why don't I move forward with this person?' 
And that answer changes from time to time. (But) it has nothing to do with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "People would say the guy is afraid of intimacy. That is as far from the truth 
as anything could be. I crave it and experience it with her on many levels, but 
not on the sexual level. . . . I think it has more to do with maturity in the 
sense of really making sure this is the right thing. To take it to a sexual 
thing, the responsibility becomes huge. I can take sex lightly with somebody 
else, but not with her." 
</P>
<P>
 Judith Davenport, a Santa Monica psychotherapist, said that despite all the 
rhetoric, it's still very hard for a woman to value herself if a man doesn't 
desire her sexually. "It's certainly a cultural thing but it's so pervasive, 
sometimes I wonder if it isn't genetic." 
</P>
<P>
 It's especially hard for the marriage-minded. Dr. Robert Kolodny, medical 
director of the Behavioral Medicine Institute in New Canaan, Conn., who has 
written several books with Masters & Johnson -- the latest titled 
"Heterosexuality" (HarperCollins, 1994) -- reported a "litany of despair" from 
commitment-seeking females who "sense the lite lover uses sexual abstinence to 
regulate the relationship so it doesn't go over the speed limit." 
</P>
<P>
 But for some women, a slow drive is just what the doctor ordered -- as in all 
the walking wounded who have been burned, divorced, or who are trying to break 
out of abusive patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives somebody a place to calm down and re-experience the male or female 
as something other than scary or negative," said Davenport, adding that lite 
love is also great practice for anyone who's simply rusty in the relationship 
department. "You're not dominated by your fusion fantasies so you can see this 
other person as a human being. And you get a great perspective into the word of 
the opposite sex." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, lite love can get heavy (after all, Harry met Sally that way). 
Bernadette Cummings, who is celibate and considers massages and hand-holding 
signs of serious intent, hopes that will happen. Suddenly interested in 
intensifying a platonic friendship of seven years, the 29-year-old San Fernando 
Valley resident explained: "If we start going out, we wouldn't have sex but I'd 
want more physical contact, like the lite love situation. I'd be seeing if I 
wanted to marry him." 
</P>
<P>
 For both sexes, living in a place like Los Angeles, where disconnected singles 
commune with "Seinfeld" and hopscotch between mates, a lite lover can be a 
remedy for loneliness.  
</P>
<P>
 "You get a family feeling -- the sense that this person is going to be there 
for you no matter what," said Tina Tessina, a Long Beach psychologist whose 
most recent book is "True Partners: A Workbook for Building a Lasting Intimate 
Relationship" (Jeremy Tarcher/Perigree, 1993), co-authored with Riley Smith. 
"For people with dysfunctional or widely scattered families, the lite lover can 
be a replacement." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that explains the story of Eileen and Ted, who met three years ago and 
have been living happily ever after. Apart. 
</P>
<P>
 The 31-year-old, self-described soul mates are in contact daily. And, even 
though both have had other relationships on the side, they say their psyches 
are so in sync, when they walk down the street their heads inevitably turn at 
exactly the same moment. 
</P>
<P>
 So why don't they just . . . you know? 
</P>
<P>
 "I value my relationship with Eileen so much, I don't want to jeopardize it by 
getting closer and becoming critical of her," said Ted, the one who wants to 
keep things lite. "It's like saying I won't drive the Rolls-Royce I have in the 
garage because I'll get a dent in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Eileen, who is willing to suffer a few dents, stays in the relationship 
because she can't imagine not having Ted in her life. "I think the closeness we 
have," she said, "a lot of married people will never have. It's very 
comforting. I know there's somebody who loves me unconditionally." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Could there be a biology lesson in all of this? After all, an important 
boundary is being crossed here. Until recently, a woman who wanted to cozy up 
without getting sexual was labeled a "tease." Now men are getting into the 
snuggling act. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Fisher proposes that there is actually a comfort chemistry at play -- 
the kind of good feelings lovers get from each other after the sexual chemistry 
wears off. "There is a science looking at the brain chemistry of attachment," 
she said, pointing to two hormones -- oxytocin and vasopressin -- that have 
been identified in association with bonding behavior in certain animals.  
</P>
<P>
 "In humans, the attachment drives are very strong. With long-term 
relationships, the first stage of crazy, euphoric love is followed by a more 
permanent phase of attachment, which offers a sense of tranquillity, warmth and 
peace. People who can't find the first stage are going for the second." 
</P>
<P>
 The trick, of course, is not to get so blissed out on a cuddle buzz that you 
close yourself off from meeting Mr. or Ms. Right. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Fluker had to go cold turkey after a year of waiting for her runway 
model to figure out what he wanted. Nevertheless, she said that year was one of 
the most exciting times in her life and she grew tremendously. "I got in touch 
with what I wanted in a mate," she said. "Bryan was such a child and I realized 
I needed someone more mature. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband is an adult. He's responsible and knows what he wants from me as a 
woman. But . . . I do miss my playmate."

 Couples accustomed to sharing a bed sleep better when they sleep alone, a 
British study has found. It also discovered that the partners believed they 
slept better when they slept together. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, published in the current issue of "Sleep," the journal of the 
American Sleep Disorders Assn. and the Sleep Research Society, studied 
nighttime movements for eight consecutive nights in 46 pairs of bed partners. 
For comparison, researchers monitored individually the sleep of 23 partners 
when the other one was away, and studied the habits of 39 other people who were 
used to sleeping alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier sleep studies have shown that movement in one bedmate, as well as 
movement by a pet that sleeps on the bed, often triggers almost immediate 
movement in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 The studies, conducted by researchers Francesca Pankhurst and James Horne of 
Loughborough University in Leicestershire, England, used a device called an 
actimeter that counted and measured the movements. They found that people whose 
partners were not home for one night went to bed earlier and slept longer and 
more peacefully.  
</P>
<P>
 Among other findings: Men are more restless than women, and older couples are 
less affected by each other's movements than younger couples.

COMMITMENTS; AFTER THE BIG BREAKUP; WOMEN DON'T HURT MORE THAN MEN AT ROMANCE'S 
END, JUST DIFFERENTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Who hurts worse? 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes neither partner feels any pain at the end. As Cal State L.A. 
psychology professor Stuart Fischoff put it, it might be better to be in no 
relationship than a bad one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes there will be a complete liberation after the end of a relationship 
that has been suffering. It's like 'Escape From New York,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One person controlling the end of the relationship will probably not suffer as 
much as the other party, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're looking at it in terms of 'dumper' or 'dumpee,' the person who's 
dumped may have more of a narcissistic injury, a blow to self-worth," Fischoff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Do women hurt more than men? 
</P>
<P>
 "Men and women bleed in different ways," Fischoff said, acknowledging that the 
perception of a man hitting the singles bars following a breakup doesn't look 
like pain, but it could be. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys are out there, frightened, trying to find validation through other 
women. It isn't a case where women's feelings are more authentic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hurt men and women experience post-breakup may be different because 
men and women often view relationships from varied perspectives, said Ken and 
Rochelle Fried, psychotherapists who have individual counseling as well as 
workshops and support groups for men and women through the Los Angles Center 
for Relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men do not define self-esteem by success or failure of a relationship," Ken 
Fried said. "Their success in the world is more outward bound. Contrarily, 
women place more emphasis on inward bound and the quality of the relationships 
they have in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, a man's recuperative period may be shorter, because he feels less of a 
sense of failure when a relationship falls apart, Ken Fried said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He may even be relieved," he added, explaining that many men's skills at 
relationships aren't as developed as women's and the freedom from dealing with 
that provides relief. "But he will feel less competent in how he will relate to 
the next woman." 
</P>
<P>
 For women, the hurt may run deeper and last longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The woman feels hurt, misled, deceived and her anger level is quite high," 
Rochelle Fried said. "She's ambivalent and having self-blame. She asks herself, 
'Did I make a poor choice?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "After the breakup, this is a very important period, a soul-searching period 
where you can evaluate the relationship and let go of it with dignity," she 
said. "This is a time when a woman begins to identify for herself what she 
wants from a relationship." REBECCA HOWARD

LITE LOVE: MAKING IT WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIZ BRODY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Experts on behavior offer suggestions for couples on the verge of a 
relationship that features cuddles without commitment: 
</P>
<P>
 Cut the deal: Make sure you're in agreement about expectations. This won't 
work if one person is set on romance or sex. Define what is tolerable for each 
of you and commit to talking about relationship issues when they come up. 
</P>
<P>
 Monitor your boundaries: Nip any mixed messages in the bud. If he says he 
doesn't want to date you but tries to sabotage your efforts to find someone 
else, call him on it. If she either assumes too much (acting as if you were her 
boyfriend) or treats you too casually (as if you were less than a best friend), 
bring it to her attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Brave the sex issue: It will come up sooner or later -- either "Why aren't 
we?" or "Should we?" To make these relationships successful, you have to 
understand that this is normal. And be prepared to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't turn this into a pseudo-romance: If you find yourself spending so much 
time with your lite lover that you're not available to meet other people, make 
an effort to chip away at the comfort zone. Call less often, don't spend 
weekend nights and holidays together, do more things by yourself. Make it clear 
that you need to look elsewhere, and then risk being alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Make the most of it: Keep in mind that lite love relationships usually end, or 
change, when you do meet someone else. In the meantime, treasure your 
friendship and don't get frustrated by what is missing. Lite love may be no 
substitute for the real thing; neither is fat-free dressing. But both can fill 
a temporary need and be good for you in the long run.

JOE ROTH GRAPPLES WITH THE KATZENBERG LEGACY; THE INCOMING HEAD OF DISNEY'S 
LIVE-ACTION FILM UNIT FACES DAUNTING CHALLENGES, NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS 
DEALING WITH THE EMOTIONAL TOLL CAUSED BY THE FORMER STUDIO CHIEF'S EXIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Joe Roth became movie chairman of 20th Century Fox in 1989, he had his 
hands full. 
</P>
<P>
 The moribund studio had produced just six movies that year and the cupboard 
was practically bare. That wasn't surprising, considering that an endless 
stream of studio heads had presided over the motion picture operation during a 
decade-long slump. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, however, Roth's appointment to soon head the live-action film 
division of Walt Disney Studios is even more overwhelming. Rather than starting 
from scratch, he will be wending his way through an already established 
operation -- not to mention executives and creative talent tightly bonded to 
the man who built it: Jeffrey Katzenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg will be leaving in a month after failing to win the No. 2 job in 
Disney corporate management. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only am I entering a 10-year familial unit," says Roth, "but coming in as 
its leader. It's not about winning them over, but about giving them enough time 
to work things through." 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar-winning filmmaker Ismail Merchant ("A Room With a View," "Howards End"), 
who, with his 33-year partner, director James Ivory, was wooed to Disney two 
years ago, says "emotional ties" in the film business run deep. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a business of delicate relationships," he says. "Something like this 
shakes our confidence -- it's a jolt." 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Robert Cort, president of Interscope Communications whose films are 
primarily distributed by Disney, draws a similar analogy. "In the film 
industry, we live on a perpetual fault line," he says. "There are always shocks 
-- and this was a big one. Jeffrey was a fixture. The company reflected a lot 
of his personality. It will take some time to re-establish the balance of our 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Roth also faces considerable business challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Though filmed entertainment has overtaken theme parks as the biggest slice of 
Disney's profit pie, most of the money has come from feature animation, home 
video, television, and the studio library. Disney may be No. 1 in market share 
among distributors right now. But the studio's live action movie division -- 
operating on the assumption that volume is the key to profitability -- has 
under-performed for the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutting down on the number of releases, Roth believes, should help. At Fox, he 
preferred to open two movies a month. Disney has already released 24 in 1994, 
with an expected total of 37 by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too much to expect one group of people to produce and market nearly 40 
films a year, " Roth said. "I told (Disney Co. chairman) Michael Eisner that 
the goal shouldn't be numbers. We should be producing only those scripts for 
which there are good ideas. Live-action movies consume a lot of cash. Marketing 
expenses have soared. The problem is volume . . . not taste." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry observers disagree. For the most part, they say, Disney product has 
been lackluster and forgettable -- cookie-cutter fare. Roth is not expected to 
make a significant course correction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeffrey and I are both mainstream commercial," the incoming studio chief 
admits unapologetically. "We believe the idea should be the locomotive of the 
movie rather than the actors or the director. If you want to call that 'high 
concept,' OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Roth's own Caravan Pictures, set up at Disney nearly three years ago, is 
pumping out movies like "The Jerky Boys" and "Low Down Dirty Shame" -- 
lightweight comedies in the Disney mold. 
</P>
<P>
 In the near future, however, some of Disney's more substantive titles will be 
surfacing. Robert Redford's fall release, "Quiz Show," starring Oscar nominee 
Ralph Fiennes, is generating positive buzz and Oscar talk in its pre-release 
screenings. And Tim Burton's black-and-white quirky period movie "Ed Wood" -- 
the true story of a schlock movie director who dressed in women's clothes -- is 
one of Disney's atypical risks. The movie, starring Johnny Depp, is due out in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 Other future releases, which will take Roth through next summer, include 
Disney's next animated feature, "Pocahontas"; John Hughes' comedy "The Bee"; a 
Sylvester Stallone vehicle, "Judge Dredd," and Tony Scott's big-budget action 
thriller, "Crimson Tide," starring Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Simpson, co-head of the William Morris talent agency's motion picture 
department, says practical considerations will also minimize change. "Though 
the attention of the rank-and-file executives will be diverted while Disney is 
restructuring," he says, "that doesn't mean projects will be derailed. The 
studio is a big machine that has to be fed." 
</P>
<P>
 Well aware of the emotional toll exacted by Katzenberg's imminent departure, 
Roth wasted no time placing calls to "talent" with whom the studio chief had 
been aligned. 
</P>
<P>
 While the conversations were pleasant, he hadn't anticipated the depth of 
feeling toward his predecessor, Roth says. "The intensity of their bond to 
Jeffrey is a great testament to him -- and daunting to me. I didn't anticipate 
it. For the umpteenth time in my life, I miscalculated." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan Kerner and Jon Avnet (Disney's "The Mighty Ducks," "When a Man Loves a 
Woman") signed an exclusive production deal with the studio last month. Though 
motion picture President David Hoberman was the key, says Kerner, Katzenberg 
was a crucial part of the mix. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they'd chosen any top movie executive other than Joe to replace him, Jon 
and I would have fled," he says. "We don't have a 'key man' clause but we would 
have begged or borrowed . . . or anything else . . . to get out." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Beatty, who locked horns with Katzenberg over criticism of "Dick Tracy" 
in the studio chief's infamous 1990 memo, said that's all in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never worked with a studio executive more energetic, more generous with 
his time, more fun," he says. "There's no corporate piece of manpower in the 
business more valuable than Jeffrey." 
</P>
<P>
 Director Steven Spielberg ("Schindler's List"), a longtime pal of the Disney 
executive, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeffrey Katzenberg's exit will be Michael Eisner's Machiavellian loss -- and 
Corporation X's El Dorado," he predicts.

FILMING THE SIMPSON SAGA; PRODUCER, STAR SAY NON-JUDGMENTAL TV MOVIE WILL TRY 
TO PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE DRAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID KRONKE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles has become both the backdrop and the back lot for the O.J. Simpson 
saga. 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown last week, attorneys for accused murderer Simpson were battling to 
persuade Judge Lance A. Ito that those who assembled evidence allegedly linking 
the football great's DNA to the site at which his former wife Nicole and her 
friend, Ronald Goldman, were killed were more bumbling than the Keystone Kops. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the Hollywood Hills in Sherman Oaks, meanwhile, at a home doubling as 
Simpson's Brentwood mansion, the momentous initial meeting between Simpson and 
attorney Robert Shapiro was being re-enacted for a Fox TV movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro: "You were pretty broken up about the divorce." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson: "Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro: "Pretty angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson (pauses, then sighs): "Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro: "Did you ever threaten her?" 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson: "I said a lot of stuff I didn't mean. You're married, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro: "Sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson: "Then you know how it is." 
</P>
<P>
 This exchange is from "The O.J. Simpson Story," set to air soon after jury 
selection is completed for Simpson's double-murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the film purports to offer a non-judgmental version of events, try 
telling that to the crew. At the Sherman Oaks set, the prop crew has fitted the 
foyer with a fake Heisman Trophy and some sympathy cards. Peek inside one of 
those cards, and an anonymous crew member's sentiments come through loud and 
clear: "You bastard" is scrawled inside the greeting card. "The DNA proves you 
did it. FRY." 
</P>
<P>
 But executive producer Robert Lovenheim is maintaining his equanimity. "I was 
in my office one Friday afternoon and started getting furious and frantic calls 
from some execs I knew at Fox, asking if I'd be interested in joining them in 
this," says Lovenheim. "At first I said no, then I said maybe, then I said, 
'Well, if you've been doing research on this, send it over.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That was the same Friday that Simpson and his friend, A.C. Cowlings, made 
their celebrated driving tour of Southern California's freeways, which 
Lovenheim caught, like the rest of the country, on TV. "After that, I was 
hooked." 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Hosea, the actor who is portraying Simpson, says other black actors 
warned him against playing the football hero-turned-suspected-murderer. "They 
say, 'Don't do it, don't do it, they won't do it right.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Another guy told me, 'No brother in town who works with any integrity is 
going to touch this movie,' " Hosea says. "I said, 'Why not?' He goes, 'Because 
it's exploitative.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'You don't think the performance is going to help a brother? I've 
been on all kinds of shows, comedies, dramas, 'China Beach,' and no one's been 
sending me any scripts. I'm auditioning right now for a Klingon.' He says, 'No, 
that's not going to help your exposure. All that's going to help is some 
producer and some network.' 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the kind of input I was getting from the outside. I wanted to hear 
what they were saying, but I knew in my heart that what I was doing was right." 
</P>
<P>
 Hosea, himself a former football player, considers Simpson a major influence 
in his life and says he's doing his best to depict him honestly: "The last 
thing he needs is a bad movie about him. He's got enough problems." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lovenheim says that 60% of "The O.J. Simpson Story" will focus on Simpson's 
life before the murders. It will open at the beginning of the week that Brown 
and Goldman were found dead, using flashbacks to tell Simpson's life story, and 
will conclude with him sitting in the Ford Bronco in the driveway at his home 
later that week, preparing to surrender to the police officers surrounding him. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovenheim acknowledges that some of the material -- such as the dialogue 
between Simpson and Shapiro -- is based on supposition. "Our efforts are to 
base every scene here on actual research or attitudes," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 What does he mean by "attitudes"? "With Bob Shapiro, he's no wallflower when 
it comes to being able to jump forward, cross a room and grab a microphone," 
explains Lovenheim, who himself bares a striking resemblance to the attorney. 
"The statements he's made to the press certainly indicate enough of what his 
attitude is, how he sees his client, how he intends to defend him and how he's 
advised him, that we can base some scenes on that. . . . We're not quoting 
every line of his word for word, but if he's expressing a certain point of view 
in what he's saying, we're saying, 'All right, we have a little license to 
create dialogue that he had with O.J. about a discussion on the same topic.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he says, "I just heard that the actor who plays A.C. Cowlings 
happened to run into the real A.C. and talked to him about his role and what 
happened during those 6 1/2 hours in the Bronco, which has always been a big 
question mark, and from what we've inferred, we were more accurate than we 
knew." 
</P>
<P>
 (David Roberson, who plays Cowlings, confirms he met his real-life counterpart 
-- "He was very nice" -- but laughs at the suggestion that he asked about the 
infamous excursion.) 
</P>
<P>
 Lovenheim's goal with the film, he says, "is to make something that, I hope, 
can be informative, create some perspective, and give people insight into 
something people want to know about right now. Because this is right now. If 
you do the research, this is a fascinating story, 30 years of a man's life. Our 
story is about the rise and the slow disintegration of somebody who became an 
American icon. That's a universal story. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our point of view is that there were events in this man's life, starting in 
his mid-30s, that shook him in ways he was never prepared for. He'd never been 
allowed to mature, understand, or deal with (his life), and there's been a slow 
unraveling of his life ever since. That's what's interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 Hosea, however, admits he had reservations when he read the script, 
particularly sequences depicting Simpson using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I'm not being naive, I know cocaine is abused in the real world," the 
actor says. "But O.J. was never arrested for that. That's hearsay, that's 
gossip." But he filmed it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The aspect of spouse abuse, that's recorded," Hosea continues. "When you have 
nine times that we know of that the police came to your house, you know you 
have a problem with your relationship. Yes, it's going to be ugly, but that's 
the reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Hosea also had reservations about the fact that Fox initially planned to 
broadcast the film on Sept. 13, only days before jury selection is to begin. 
Fox, after complaints from Shapiro and media critics, relented and agree to 
wait until a jury was impaneled. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they decided to wait until the jury was sequestered, that was a burden 
released from my heart," he says. "I felt we don't have to hide behind the 
Constitution. Sure, we have a right to air it, but let's be a little morally 
upstanding here." 
</P>
<P>
 Lovenheim says he too welcomed the delay. "This movie doesn't have to do with 
the trial, it doesn't have to do with guilt or innocence, but certain people 
out there believe that it could be injurious, so sure, why not postpone it?" he 
says. "As far as I'm concerned, it's a reprieve. I get (more time) to cut the 
movie." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lovenheim has thought long and hard about The Meaning of O.J. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an aspect to this case that is unsettling far beyond this case," he 
observes. "It defines Los Angeles at a particular point in time, where so many 
things are in chaos and there is so little security in what the future might 
bring. . . . For African Americans, this is a case of black versus white, it's 
about a man who has reached the pinnacle in a white world and has been been 
pushed back down. For the majority, it's a case of rich versus poor -- can 
justice work if you have all the money in the world the same way if you have no 
money? . . . For the politicians, it's how do we prove we can control law and 
order when we can't win a case? We lost Rodney King, we lost Reginald Denny, we 
didn't win the Menendez brothers, and now, it's O.J. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it's about a city that's going broke," Lovenheim continues. "Most of the 
police cars are these 1986 Chevy Caprices with hundreds of thousands of miles 
on them. The streets are bumpy because they can't afford to pave them. . . . 
How can you justify a show trial that's going to cost millions and millions of 
dollars when you can't afford to keep the city going? It's like saying, 'If we 
can't give them bread, we'll give them circuses.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the questions," Lovenheim says. Then he adds, anticlimactically, 
"Those aren't the questions of this movie."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: JAY LENO'S EULOGY DOES HIS DAD PROUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the one-year anniversary of David Letterman's celebrated relocation to CBS 
en route to late-night glory, here's a toast to Jay Leno. 
</P>
<P>
 Today is the one-week anniversary of his tribute to his dad. 
</P>
<P>
 Following his usual stand-up monologue ("'Hey, folks, story of the week . . 
.") on last Monday's "Tonight Show," Leno went to his desk and spent the next 
eight minutes of his NBC hour tenderly eulogizing his father, Angelo Leno, who 
had died the previous week of cancer at age 83. 
</P>
<P>
 It was special; it was memorable. Even rarer for television, it was genuine. 
</P>
<P>
 One of TV's oldest yet least-supportable cliches is that the camera doesn't 
lie -- that no defense, tactic or sham, no matter how shrewd and well designed, 
is impervious to its laser lens. But of course the camera does lie. Or at the 
very least can be made to lie, or blur or shade or distort the truth when under 
the control of those who are nimble at manipulation. As their numbers and the 
sophistication of the technology increase, so, too, does the medium's potential 
for deception. Opportunistic politicians stand to benefit, as do journalist 
poseurs and other media actors. 
</P>
<P>
 And nowhere on television is the line separating acting and actuality less 
discernible than on celeb-laden late-night talk shows, where the performance -- 
a guest's seemingly candid schmoozing with the host in front of millions of 
viewers -- is often mistaken for some kind of bear-all, insightful truth. On 
the contrary, although there's nothing actually corrupt about the process, it's 
all part of the show. Give an actor a camera and he acts. 
</P>
<P>
 The few exceptions on TV include the times that Sally Jessy Raphael has spoken 
of the 1992 death of her daughter, Allison Vladimir, at age 33, and Johnny 
Carson's heartfelt comments in 1991 when, fighting back tears, he eulogized his 
39-year-old son, Rick, who had died in an automobile accident. Carson displayed 
a photograph of his son, saying, "The picture in papers after the accident was 
the one on his driver's license. I don't think any of you would want to be 
remembered by the photo on your driver's license." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leno's loving testimonial to his father was another infrequent example of TV 
honesty rearing its lovely head, one all the more meaningful because of the way 
the medium so often impersonalizes death by depicting or dwelling on it so 
routinely. And meaningful also because Leno's remarks were untypical of a show 
so deeply immersed in fun and joviality. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged the awkward segue to serious monologue from funny monologue. 
Poignant without being maudlin, he began: "I don't know. . . . It's a shame 
when you do this every day. . . . You write jokes . . . and things happen in 
life. I'd thought I'd take a minute to sort of talk about them. . . . I just 
thought I would tell you a little bit about my dad, if I could." 
</P>
<P>
 Like all comics, Leno is an actor, too, and he told some funny/sweet stories 
about his father that made the studio audience laugh. Yet there was nothing 
false here and, even though you felt his emotion, there was no artificial 
sentiment calculated to evoke tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Leno mentioned that his mother, Catherine, had died last year, and that his 
dad "didn't really have much reason to go on once my mom went. Fifty-seven 
years they were married." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Angelo Leno had grown up a "street kid" in New York City. "Son of 
immigrant parents. I never knew how far my dad got in school. He would never 
tell me. I knew he quit somewhere. I don't know whether it was junior high or 
high school. He was a prize fighter and a truck driver and a mechanic. He went 
on to become an insurance salesman, and then he became a district manager and 
then went back to school and . . . a real up-from-the-bootstraps kind of guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Leno said he never heard his dad "say a cross word to my mom, never saw him 
raise his hand. Never saw him drunk." He said he also never heard his dad utter 
an "ethnic slur." 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled getting a letter from a woman in Harlem, where Angelo -- in 
contrast to his colleagues, who felt that black people had no "future" -- once 
sold insurance door to door. "And she was in her 60s, I guess. And she wanted 
to know if the Angelo Leno that came to her house (when she was a child) was 
possibly my dad. And I called her up, and we talked and she told me some of the 
stories." 
</P>
<P>
 One was that Leno's dad "was the only white person they've ever had in their 
home. . . . And my father would bring her gifts and candy and tell her 
stories." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angelo Leno instinctively did the right thing, his famous son told America a 
week ago. "There are people who go through life . . . and you know they write 
letters and they march and they do those things, which is great. And there are 
people who just do the right thing. For whatever reason, they don't ask for any 
reward." Leno said he was proud of his dad for being one of those people. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, there was a crack in Leno's composure. 
</P>
<P>
 A slight tremor entered his voice as he continued, mentioning that "nobody was 
brought up righter than I was" and that his parents were always behind him, 
even during those troubled days when there were rumors that his job as Carson's 
successor was in jeopardy because NBC wanted Letterman. 
</P>
<P>
 Leno said he never understood until now what being "lonely at the top" meant. 
He said his parents "were always there for me to talk to. Even two years ago, 
when we were going through, 'Oh, is Jay going to get fired? Is he going to be 
replaced?,' my dad would always say, 'Hey, you fight the good fight, son. You 
just get in there and fight the good fight!' 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, it really is lonely at the top," Leno added. "You have no idea." He 
exhaled loudly, expelling a great woosh of emotion. "But . . . we'll fight the 
good fight, Pop." 
</P>
<P>

COUNTERPUNCH: TWO GAPS IN THE TV TAPESTRY; WHAT KIND OF RATIONALE DID PROGRAM 
OFFICIALS AT FOX USE WHEN THEY CANCELED 'SOUTH CENTRAL,' BUT KEPT 'MODELS INC.' 
ON THE FALL LINEUP? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL E. CALDWELL, Michael E. Caldwell is a Los Angeles resident and 
actor, most recently seen in Sweetwater Blues at the Marla Gibbs' Vision 
Complex Theatre. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calendar's Morning Report of Aug. 12 noted that "despite lackluster ratings," 
Fox-TV has decided to order nine additional episodes of "Models Inc." to round 
out a complete 22-show season. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't 
questionable ratings the same reason those same persons gave "South Central" an 
eviction notice? 
</P>
<P>
 If both of these programs were measured by the same yardstick, then why did 
one get dropped while the other was allowed to continue? Let's examine the 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox has chosen to go with a series, "Models Inc.," that plays like a daytime 
soap and takes place in a fantasy world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Models Inc." is a spinoff of "Melrose Place," which is a spinoff of "Beverly 
Hills, 90210." So much for originality. None of these shows has a regular 
African American character of any kind. Recently "Models Inc." did add an 
African American woman to its cast. Let's see if her character will truly be 
"in living color." Other than that, I had only seen African Americans 
occasionally, such as in guest spots in a particular story or as extras. Except 
in Amish country and maybe a few other spots, there are African Americans all 
over the nation, including Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "South Central," on the other hand, showed a slice of the real world. And I 
believe it was the best program to grace the airwaves in many years. 
</P>
<P>
 The program illustrated the difficulties inherent in single-parent homes 
without becoming preachy or sentimental. As I watched, I felt the pain of a 
mother doing the best she could for her children, while wanting to take some 
time for herself. Real mothers do that. I saw the hurt in a young daughter's 
eyes when much more than her 14 years was asked of her by her unintentionally 
demanding mother. Real daughters experience that. I know the anger a son feels 
when he takes on the responsibility he feels is his because his father 
abandoned the family years earlier. Real sons get angry as well. I saw a family 
that pulled together, fell apart, fought, made up, sometimes went to bed and 
woke up mad at each other. Real families go through the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "South Central" was not stereotypical, it was real . 
</P>
<P>
 The people at Fox should open their eyes. They had the opportunity to bring 
quality to the air, and educate a nation to what America is all about.  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's still not too late.

COUNTERPUNCH: IT'S NOT TRUE THAT 'LIES' HELPS WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL TREADWELL, Carol Treadwell, a Los Angeles painter and photographer, is 
a graduate of UC Berkeley. Her work is showing at ADR Fine Arts Gallery in Los 
Angeles through Sept. 23. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I believe Douglas Eby is misguided in his contention that the character of 
Helen Tasker in the film "True Lies" contributes something "valid and valuable 
toward improving real-life attitudes about women" ("Curtis' True Role in 
'Lies': Empowerment," Counterpunch, Calendar, Aug. 8). Make no mistake, I 
walked into the theater more prepared than perhaps I ought to have been to 
ignore the sexism that seems to be a preferred fuel for action-packed plots: I 
wanted to enjoy it. However, the sexism in this film was much too offensive to 
carry comfortably along for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from being what Eby calls "a woman making use of her anger to help 
transform herself and doing what she can to defend herself . . . rather than 
waiting for rescue," the Jamie Lee Curtis character is a woman defined by what 
she can't do to defend herself (anything), what she can't figure out (anything) 
and who will figure it out for her (her husband). She is a desperate and 
ineffectual figure who behaves as if her blood-sugar level is dangerously low, 
causing her to meagerly perceive situations and to react to them with panic 
and/or collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 From the first, Helen Tasker is marked for humiliation. The infatuation that 
begins her transformation from mousy housewife to action-babe is itself based 
on her ignorant faith in a con artist (Bill Paxton). His impersonation of a spy 
is so obviously bogus to the audience and her husband that her gullible 
interest in him defines her as just one thing: stupid. There is no one, not the 
audience, not her husband, not her would-be lover who does not know better than 
she. She is isolated, suspended for ridicule, like an offender clamped in the 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If she is the circus clown, it soon becomes clear who is the fearsome lion. We 
are offered a scene in which her husband (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his 
sidekick (Tom Arnold) interrogate her from behind a one-way mirror. She is 
forced into a position of complete helplessness and made to reveal not only the 
facts about her non-affair, but the emotions that led her to it. Even when she 
finally gets angry and pounds the mirror in frustration, the small damage she 
causes only proves her inability to cause real damage (i.e., have a meaningful 
impact); it amuses the men, rather than threatens them. It is a cowardly scene 
in which the two men use their power and resources to exploit her 
powerlessness, but they are never held accountable. Before the audience has 
time to call them cowards, they are off being heroes again. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as grating as these grossly sexist dynamics are the smaller insults 
peppered throughout the film. It is not a case of the bad guys and sleazeballs 
saying or doing a couple of wrong things and paying for it, but an overall 
tone, a complete filmic world in which the only "good" woman is a pointless 
woman. In a chilling moment, the Tom Arnold character, who is meant to be 
sympathetic, blithely tells his friend, "Women, can't live with 'em, can't kill 
'em." If this an example of healthy male bonding, the message from this world 
is clear to me: "KEEP OUT." 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Tasker herself reacts to almost any plot twist by screaming loudly, a 
useless response that not only highlights her ineffectiveness, but often 
jeopardizes her husband's important terrorist-stopping duty, making her worse 
than irrelevant: Now she's a liability. Is it possible that Eby mistakes a 
"strong and credible portrayal" for a strong and credible character? 
</P>
<P>
 Even at the film's climax, clever plot twists prevent her from becoming more 
than the weak, self-deprecating character the film clearly portrays. 
</P>
<P>
 In the entire movie, the only thing she does effectively is fend off the horny 
car salesman/spy, who tried to pounce on her in his trailer. This 
out-of-character boldness can only be explained by the plot's desire that she 
retain her good-wife morality for her husband's exploits. 
</P>
<P>
 Eby points out that the actress enjoyed her work, that she called this "the 
best role I've ever had." But while dancing sexily with a bedpost may be fun as 
an activity, it is the specific placement of this dance within the movie's 
context that renders it disturbing: We have a husband who needs to see his wife 
as a prostitute to rekindle his desire for her, a wife forced into obeying his 
scheme to get her there, who (like in the interrogation scene) is not aware of 
his presence, and who falls flat on her face just as she seems in danger of 
becoming a successful seductress. Indeed, each time it seems that the character 
might take on even one more dimension, this expectation is sealed off with a 
door as thick as a bank vault's. Her one-dimensional position is below that of 
the terrorists, who are supposed to be the bad guys. At least we fear them; 
she's just a joke.

COUNTERPUNCH: TWO GAPS IN THE TV TAPESTRY; DROPPING 'IN LIVING COLOR' LEAVES A 
VOID. WHERE ELSE COULD VIEWERS FIND SATIRE WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE AS LONG AS 
THE SKITS WERE FUNNY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LES FIRESTEIN, Les Firestein, a Los Angeles screenwriter and television 
producer, worked on In Living Color in various capacities from 1990 to 1994. He 
was executive producer of the controversial show during its final season. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When "In Living Color" was canceled this summer -- victim of what some joked 
was a policy of "ethnic cleansing" at Fox -- both the airwaves and the 
entertainment community lost a special place. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, "In Living Color" was able to confront and handle racially 
sensitive subject matter with a force and precision not seen before. And we 
were able to do something no other "mainstream" show could do: poke fun at 
black celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it was one of our most frequent targets -- the Rev. Jesse Jackson 
-- who was one of the very first to lament our passing. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the hole left behind by "In Living Color" runs deeper: 
</P>
<P>
 It was a place where Harvard and Howard grads commingled more than easily; 
where writers from New York's Upper East Side and L.A.'s South-Central worked 
together in harmony for a common cause: to make people laugh, to make people 
mad and then to make them laugh again. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, "In Living Color" was a special place because it was a place where 
funny ruled. And on any given day, "funny" could have any given color. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be Damon Wayans (black), Jim Carrey (white) or Steve Parks (Asian). 
It could also be male or female. Creator Keenan Ivory Wayans was fond of 
saying, "If it's funny, we shoot it. But if it's not funny -- then we shoot it 
in the head." 
</P>
<P>
 "ILC" was a place where blacks and whites routinely exchanged books and ideas 
as well as inflammatory propaganda, and it was also the location of the most 
incredible writers' table discussion on "roots" that I've ever encountered. 
</P>
<P>
 After each of the show's 18 writers and producers traced back their ancestry 
and entry into this country, one thing was for certain: We all got here the 
hard way. 
</P>
<P>
 However, "In Living Color" did not operate in a vacuum. It was a place where 
some of my black colleagues were stopped and suspected of theft by a white 
guard for test-driving my new sports car around the Fox lot. Likewise, it was a 
place where I routinely had my car searched by an African American guard while 
my black friends whizzed by unimpeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps at no time have I more acutely felt the loss of "In Living Color" than 
during the recent O.J. Simpson debacle. Mere instants after the initial chase, 
old "ILC" cronies had my phone ringing off the hook with possible sketch ideas: 
</P>
<P>
 One ex-writer suggested it would have been fun to update the old O.J. Simpson 
Hertz ad -- with cops chasing an airborne Simpson through LAX. Someone else 
suggested that the driver of the white Bronco could be Rodney G. King. 
</P>
<P>
 While still another ex-writer, tailoring the O.J. chase to a current summer 
blockbuster -- suggested that Keanu Reeves should jump on the Simpson vehicle . 
. . which -- in the "ILC" sketch version -- would be rigged to explode if Al 
Cowlings drove at a speed less than 50 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever way "In Living Color" would have handled the Simpson case, two things 
are for certain: 1) We would have gone too far, and 2) You would have laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 A common refrain around the "In Living Color" production offices was Rodney 
King's innocent query, "Can't we all just get along?" 
</P>
<P>
 After five seasons on "In Living Color," I can tell you. The answer is: Yes.

 Six friends -- three women, three men, all in their 20s -- come back to an 
apartment after a few cappuccinos at the local coffee bar and spread out 
through the chic living room-kitchen nook area. Most are bug-eyed, looking up 
at the glowing portable TV on a high shelf against the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 On the tube is a Spanish-language soap opera. None of the friends speaks more 
Spanish than "taco" or "adios," but they are transfixed nonetheless. As the 
obligatory cat-fight scene between two women on the screen progresses, the 
friends start chanting, "Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!" 
-- and cheer mightily when it happens. 
</P>
<P>
 An unlikely scenario? Well, maybe, but not in the world of television. For 
this is a scene from the pilot of the highly touted new NBC sitcom, "Friends," 
one of three scenes in that show where one or more of the friends are watching 
the cathode box. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people today are TV obsessed," said David Crane, one of the executive 
producers of "Friends." "We grew up on television and we have become very 
television obsessed. These people (in the show) are very real and, being real, 
they watch TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the excuse, clearly these days, on TV the TV is on. 
</P>
<P>
 Time was when TV references could rarely be found on TV shows. For one thing, 
the mentioning of another show or its characters, it was thought, might make 
you realize there was something else on another station. Even when the show was 
about a TV show, like "The Dick Van Dyke Show," you rarely, if ever, saw the 
show-within-the-show being produced. People, on the screen and in front of it, 
had a life -- or, at the very least, a life outside of television. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, it seems, hardly a sitcom -- or even a news event -- can go by without 
a reference to television in some way. On an episode of CBS' "Evening Shade" 
last season, when the Burt Reynolds and Marilu Henner characters were planning 
to renew their marriage vows, the men attended a dull bachelor party while the 
women had a bridal shower that featured an appearance by a policeman who turned 
out to be a stripper. The dialogue that later ensued:  
</P>
<P>
 One man: "You did things to that cop you can't do on 'NYPD Blue.' " 
</P>
<P>
 One woman: "You're just mad because you relied on Captain Kangaroo to provide 
your entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 Another man, miffed: "I'm a perfectly good host." 
</P>
<P>
 Same woman: "That's what Chevy Chase said." 
</P>
<P>
 "In earlier days, references in programs may have been to theater or magazine 
articles or books," said Robert Batscha, president of the New York-based Museum 
of Radio and Television. "References must be to what everyone knows, because 
you are writing to such a large audience. People's commonality of experience 
now is television." 
</P>
<P>
 TV has become all-pervasive. It is our our tie to the rest of society. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really do believe that a big change overtook this culture through the 
1970s," said Mark Crispin Miller, a professor of media studies at Johns Hopkins 
University and a media critic often published in the New Republic. "TV changed. 
It became markedly more titillating and faster-paced. Kids tended to watch more 
of it than they did in the past. It used to be, 'Let's watch this certain 
program tonight,' then it became, 'Let's watch television.' Rock 'n' roll was 
not primarily a televisual experience until MTV. You listened to it and danced 
to it. Now you watch it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very, very pervasive change. TV is more of what's going on than it 
used to be," said Miller. "It is our only shared culture. It has supplanted all 
previous amusements and cultural forms and distracted us from a range of other 
institutions. The most obvious one is it keeps us in the house, free from other 
associations." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So when people write about television for television today, they are following 
the old Composition 101 dictum: "Write about what you know." And a lot of 
writers don't think that is as heinous as Miller posits. 
</P>
<P>
 "People love observational humor. They love to be able to relate to things 
they've experienced," said David Mirkin, executive producer for the past two 
years of "The Simpsons," which overflows with TV references. "They love to 
recognize something they've seen on TV and then see it again in another 
context." 
</P>
<P>
 The phenomenon runs the gamut from intellectual favorites like HBO's "The 
Larry Sanders Show," which spoofs the contrivances of the late-night television 
format, to a kiddie-zone show like ABC's "Sister, Sister," whose pilot this 
spring had references to "The Twilight Zone," "Beavis and Butt-head," Oprah 
Winfrey, Montel Williams and Geraldo Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
 Television has become like an M. C. Escher painting, in which the people who 
are watching television are watching people watch television. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the phenomenon really got started with the shows of the mid-to-late 
1980s," said Batscha of the Museum of Radio and Television. "The writers of 
shows like 'thirtysomething,' 'Kate & Allie' and 'Moonlighting' were a smart 
group of young writers trying to reach their own age group, the 18-to-35s of 
the time. They saw these references as something everyone could understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went to college, you wanted to write the great American novel; now you 
want to write the great series, and I don't think that's all that bad," said 
Batscha. "Young people who are writing for television today are unashamedly 
positive about the medium. The early writers for television seemed to be in it 
because it was the work they could find. The writers in it now love it. They're 
not as ambitious to do a film. And they aren't ashamed of television's 
history." 
</P>
<P>
 A few examples of their varied self-referential methods: 
</P>
<P>
 * On "Dream On," the cops arranging a surrender in this season's premiere 
episode were played by Taurean Blacque, Ed Marinaro, Joe Spano, Michael Warren 
and Bruce Weitz, all of whom played cops years ago on "Hill Street Blues." 
</P>
<P>
 * On "Love & War," Jerry Seinfeld and his "Seinfeld" executive producer, Larry 
David, were seen at the end of an episode considering proposed scripts by the 
"Love & War" characters. 
</P>
<P>
 * On "Murphy Brown" (which has had as guest stars a slew of network newsies 
such as Katie Couric, Irving R. Levine, Paula Zahn, Joan Lunden and the 
formerly unself-referential Walter Cronkite), Murphy finally found a great 
secretary: Marcia Wallace, reprising her "Bob Newhart Show" role as Carol 
Kester Bondurant. By the end of the episode, Newhart (as "Newhart" or just 
plain Newhart?) appeared to re-employ her. 
</P>
<P>
 * On "Roseanne," when the woman playing the part of older daughter Becky was 
replaced without the character changing, the family sat on the couch in front 
of the TV watching a "Bewitched" rerun and commented on the similar replacement 
of Dick York by Dick Sargent in that show's male lead. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Home Improvement," "Murphy Brown," "The Larry Sanders Show," "The Critic" 
and "Coach" either center around TV or have major characters who are employed 
by TV. That will also be the case on NBC's new "Martin Short Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Although sitcoms do more of the TV references, dramas are not immune. On "NYPD 
Blue" last season, for instance, guest star John Wesley Shipp was playing a cop 
who had gone undercover. In a card game, he complained that he lost his "flash 
money," the extra money given to undercover cops so that they can pass in their 
"other" worlds. Shipp, you may remember, played the lead in the short-lived but 
well-regarded "The Flash" a couple of seasons past.

SAGANSKY EXPECTED TO GET HIGH SONY POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN and ALAN CITRON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeffrey Sagansky, who guided CBS from third to first place in the network 
ratings, is expected to be named president of Sony Software, the holding 
company of Sony Pictures, Sony Music and the company's growing multimedia 
operations, knowledgeable sources said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagansky's appointment will put an executive with experience in both 
television and the movie industry at the helm of one of the largest 
entertainment companies in the country. Until leaving for CBS in 1989, Sagansky 
was president of TriStar Pictures, a Sony subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagansky, former chief programmer at CBS who left the network earlier this 
summer, will report to current Sony Software President Michael P. Schulhof, who 
is expected to be promoted to chairman of Sony Software, the sources added. 
Sagansky will be based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagansky is said to be in final negotiations and an announcement is expected 
be made later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Sagansky's job will include shoring up business at Sony's 
divisions, especially its troubled Sony Pictures unit. But in an unusual 
arrangement, Sony Pictures Chairman Peter Guber will continue to report 
directly to Schulhof. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be only temporary, however, because many people in the industry 
expect Guber, who has headed Sony Pictures for nearly five years, to return to 
producing or take a higher corporate post within Sony as early as next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagansky, who is out of town, could not be reached for comment. Sony 
executives were also unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
 Since leaving CBS when his contract expired, Sagansky has been weighing 
various offers, including becoming a partner in Savoy Pictures, the independent 
film production and distribution company. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors of his possible hiring at Sony have circulated in Hollywood and on Wall 
Street for weeks, but exactly how Sagansky and Schulhof will delineate 
responsibility is not clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing in Sagansky may serve several corporate purposes. Sony has been 
trying to sell a 25% stake in its Sony Pictures unit for months, and Sagansky 
could help find an investor. With his experience in film and TV, he could also 
help jump-start business at Sony Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulhof, a former physicist, is the highest-ranking American at Tokyo-based 
Sony, but he does not have a background in entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony Corp., the Japanese electronics giant, entered the American entertainment 
arena with a big splash in the late 1980s, when it acquired the former CBS 
Records and Columbia Pictures in rapid order. 
</P>
<P>
 Its bright spot so far is Sony Music, based in New York, whose artists include 
Pearl Jam, Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen and Mariah Carey. The music 
company is second only to Time Warner in domestic market share and enjoyed 1993 
global revenue of $4.48 billion under its president, Thomas D. Mottola. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, Sony Pictures in Culver City -- the parent company of Columbia 
Pictures and TriStar Pictures -- has suffered from consistent management 
turnover and a string of box office failures. This year's disappointments 
include "City Slickers 2" and "Blankman." After capturing nearly 20% of the 
domestic box office market share last year, Sony is mired around 11% this year. 
Movie revenue dropped 7%, to $3.2 billion, for the fiscal year ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems at Sony Pictures have spawned repeated rumors that Guber will resign 
in the near future. Sources say the executive, whose production credits include 
"Batman" and "Gorillas in the Mist," has openly confessed his frustrations with 
the job. But publicly, at least, Sony insists that Guber is in for the long 
haul. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been speculation in recent weeks that Sony was wooing Walt Disney 
Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, who lost a bid to play a larger role at 
the entertainment company. But last week, Sony denied that it was in 
negotiations with Katzenberg, and Sagansky's hiring seems to make a deal with 
Katzenberg highly unlikely.

UP TO $50 MILLION LOST IN HOUSING SCHEME, U.S. SAYS; CRIME: SOUTHLAND 
BUSINESSMAN ACCUSED OF DIVERTING FUNDS FROM INVESTORS, FEDERAL TREASURY. HE 
PLEADS NOT GUILTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Developer John Goodin hoped the rushed real estate deal he made on New Year's 
Eve 1990 would straighten out his shaky business affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it became a legal quagmire that soon pushed Goodin -- and several 
partners -- close to financial ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 A year and a half later, the 47-year-old father of three found a way out. On 
the afternoon of June 10, 1992, Goodin walked into the bathroom of his Columbus 
home, put a 12-gauge shotgun to his face and pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodin's wife blames his suicide on distress over the ill-fated sale of two 
low-income apartment complexes in Ohio to Gary W. Lefkowitz, a mercurial 
Southern Californian who sold limited partnerships in low-income housing funded 
by federal tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It put a lot of pressure on him," said Judy Goodin. "He felt guilty having 
got his friends involved." 
</P>
<P>
 In May, a federal grand jury in Minneapolis indicted Lefkowitz, a lawyer who 
lives in Beverly Hills, on 45 counts of fraud, embezzlement, obstruction of 
justice and filing false tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities allege that Lefkowitz, owner of Citi Equity Group in 
Culver City, masterminded a sophisticated scheme to divert up to $50 million 
from dozens of developers, thousands of investors and the federal treasury to 
support his extravagant lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 He has pleaded not guilty and is free on $1-million bail. With his company in 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Lefkowitz is being represented by a public defender and 
has told the court that he is contemplating insanity as a defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Lefkowitz, 41, declined several requests for interviews. But a review of court 
records involving Lefkowitz and interviews with former employees and associates 
lay out a story that reads like a portrait of a con artist as a young man. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in Southern California's caldron of white-collar crime, the Lefkowitz 
saga -- as set forth in the federal indictment -- stands out as a tale of 
extraordinary greed. 
</P>
<P>
 While presenting himself as a do-gooder providing shelter for the nation's 
poor, Lefkowitz lived a high life with mansions in Beverly Hills and Colorado 
and a stable of luxury cars and corporate jets at his call. For his 40th 
birthday, he threw himself a $500,000 bash on the ski slopes of Vail, Colo. 
Lefkowitz and his wife spent up to $48,000 a month on artwork; meanwhile, he 
lavished gifts on a girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, developers insist that he pushed them to the edge of 
bankruptcy, investors say he bilked them out of retirement nest eggs, and 
government officials claim that he deprived hundreds of poor people of the 
chance to live in affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Said one federal investigator: "This guy's a made-for-TV movie." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Wayne Lefkowitz is a product of the San Fernando Valley, where his 
Midwestern-bred parents migrated to raise their son and three daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 As Lefkowitz described it to associates, his was not a happy childhood. Money 
came and went from the family's Granada Hills home with the swiftness of a 
Santa Ana wind. In 1979, his father, Albert Lefkowitz, was convicted of income 
tax evasion and served a year in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Gary rarely looked back. But one bitter story that Lefkowitz repeatedly 
shared with friends was that he was given a new car by his father only to have 
it repossessed a few months later. Albert Lefkowitz could not be located for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of Granada Hills High School, Gary entered the University of 
Southern California in 1970, earning a degree in business administration. In 
1974, he went on to Loyola University law school. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating, Lefkowitz opened a public interest law clinic in West 
Hollywood and had some success representing elderly tenants fighting evictions 
as their apartments were being converted to condominiums. He raised money for 
then-Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., creating ties to the liberal Democrat 
that earned Lefkowitz a two-year appointment in 1980 as a member of the 
California Department of Real Estate's advisory commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the professional success, his personal life was a mess. By his early 
30s, Lefkowitz had been married four times. His third marriage lasted just nine 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Business partnerships also were short-lived. When a former law partner sued 
him in 1985, an employee testified that Lefkowitz habitually avoided process 
servers and "doesn't like to pay bills unless he absolutely, positively has 
to." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Chier, a Los Angeles criminal defense attorney who shared an office 
with Lefkowitz in the early '80s, recalls him as "the crudest, rudest man I 
ever met." Adds Chier: "He was always beating people out of things." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Edith Beck and her son Donald. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, the Becks hired Lefkowitz, a family friend, to represent them in a 
real estate lawsuit. He advised Donald to turn over four properties to his 
mother in case of an adverse court decision. Lefkowitz prepared and held onto 
four quitclaim deeds. When the deeds later were recorded, Edith's name had been 
replaced with that of another Lefkowitz client. 
</P>
<P>
 He also brought the Becks into a deal with several other investors, who 
together purchased a City of Commerce property for $800,000 -- most of it 
provided by the Becks. When the partners had a falling out, the property was 
sold in early 1982 without the Becks' knowledge. Edith held a $150,000 deed of 
trust on the property. But she was never paid, because someone had forged her 
name on a request for reconveyance held for her by Lefkowitz. 
</P>
<P>
 A complaint was lodged against Lefkowitz with the State Bar of California. 
After prolonged proceedings, the State Bar Court ruled that it "was not proved 
by clear and convincing evidence" that Lefkowitz forged the documents. But the 
court recommended that he be suspended for a year for acts of "moral turpitude 
and dishonesty." 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court approved the suspension in 1989, with one justice dissenting 
that "a more severe discipline" should have been imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was sad to me how he had conned these people," said Erica Tabachnick, the 
State Bar examiner in the case. "He destroyed them, but was cavalier about it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, Lefkowitz opened an office in Beverly Hills and through a law partner 
met several successful syndicators -- individuals who form partnerships to 
raise money for real estate projects. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them was A. Bruce Rozet of Brentwood. By the late '80s, Rozet was the 
nation's largest operator of subsidized low-income housing, controlling 350 
projects with 45,000 units in 40 states. A major contributor to California 
Democratic politicians, he often testified in Congress about low-income housing 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Rozet became wealthy buying and managing projects subsidized by the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development. But in 1990, HUD accused him of 
operating slum properties and charging excessive fees. He was barred from doing 
business with the department for a year, though Rozet denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lefkowitz was awed by the real estate empire that Rozet commanded and often 
sought his counsel. "Rozet was Gary's mentor," said Paul Schwartz, a former 
Citi Equity property manager who for a time was a close friend of Lefkowitz and 
later testified against him before the federal grand jury in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Rozet, however, said his relationship with Lefkowitz was never intimate. "A 
lot of people claim they have learned something from me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first successful syndications that Lefkowitz performed in 1985 were of 
properties owned by Rozet affiliates. But problems arose; New Mexico regulators 
issued a cease-and-desist order against Lefkowitz, Citi Equity, Rozet and 
others for selling unregistered securities. The order was in place until 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Lefkowitz was struggling to build Citi Equity, the bottom fell out of the 
real estate syndication business. The reason: the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which 
eliminated most tax shelters, sharply curtailing investor interest in real 
estate partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 But Congress approved one new tax shelter to encourage the development of 
affordable housing. Instead of providing budget-busting direct subsidies, the 
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit grants credits to developers of affordable 
housing projects. The developers sell the tax credits to investors, who use 
them to offset federal income tax liability on a dollar-for-dollar basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual investors can claim tax credits of $3,750 to $9,900 annually -- 
depending on their tax bracket -- for 10 years. For instance, a high-income 
investor in the 31% tax bracket who makes a $45,000 investment in a qualifying 
low-income housing project can claim tax credits of $7,750 yearly for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing an opportunity, Lefkowitz moved quickly. Initially, he scoured the 
country for apartment complexes to purchase and convert into low-income 
housing. He soon was one of the nation's most active low-income housing 
syndicators. 
</P>
<P>
 Lefkowitz's enthusiasm could be contagious, his spiel convincing. Former 
employees say his eyes would fill with tears as he sought to convince 
developers and others of the need for affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would tell them that they would be providing housing to people who 
otherwise might not have any," said Schwartz. "They could make money and also 
do some good." Citi Equity adopted the slogan "Good Happens." 
</P>
<P>
 The company focused its early activity on the Midwest, particularly Minnesota 
and Ohio, where higher allowable monthly rents and low building costs made 
projects most feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 Lefkowitz cut an impressive figure to many small-town developers. Arriving in 
a Learjet and wearing expensive suits, he could dazzle with his photographic 
memory and knowledge of real estate, housing and finance. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a very personable, persuasive guy," said Ohio developer Paul Bouman. 
"He was confident, a very good salesman." 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly he promised what builders badly needed -- financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lefkowitz said he had money -- a 1990 financial statement put his net worth at 
$18 million -- and lived like he did. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his fourth wife, Frann, moved to Beverly Hills in the mid-'80s, living 
in a home tastefully decorated with Alex Katz paintings. They soon relocated to 
a mansion with marble floors in the city's older, more exclusive section. 
</P>
<P>
 Regular patrons of Rodeo Drive, Lefkowitz and his wife spent more than $2 
million on clothing, jewelry and art at Fred Hayman, Hermes, Maxfield, Merletto 
and other exclusive stores, according to the federal indictment. In 1993 alone, 
the couple was spending as much as $48,000 a month on various art objects, 
according to bankruptcy court filings. Among their prized possessions was a 
large collection of antique kaleidoscopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spending money was an obsession with him," said Wayne Laner, a former Citi 
Equity pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's fleet of aircraft grew to three, and Lefkowitz used the planes 
for vacations in France or skiing weekends in Colorado, where he acquired a 
$2-million mountainside home with a five-story elevator. 
</P>
<P>
 He gave a girlfriend a $17,000 Jeep and a fur coat, according to prosecution 
filings in the criminal case. And Citi Equity acquired more than 20 cars, many 
of which were kept at Lefkowitz's disposal. He often drove a Porsche or Jaguar, 
his wife a Mercedes. For his 40th birthday, Frann gave him a custom-built 1993 
Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 But the indictment alleges that Lefkowitz's lavish lifestyle was paid for with 
funds embezzled from Citi Equity. He is accused of commingling funds of various 
partnerships and taking out loans that he never intended to repay. 
</P>
<P>
 In one civil case, Schwartz testified that Lefkowitz had boasted about having 
two checking accounts. "He had one called OPM, which stood for 'other people's 
money' and one called TMR, for 'take the money and run,' " Schwartz recounted 
in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Citi Equity employees describe Lefkowitz as a manipulator who insisted on 
total control. With an explosive temper, he could be verbally and physically 
intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
 He surrounded himself with employees with questionable backgrounds who asked 
few questions. Schwartz once was charged with forgery, though the case was 
dropped when he made restitution. Lefkowitz's most trusted aide, Laurie Egan, 
served jail time for heroin possession. The head of his mortgage unit was fired 
by a Texas thrift for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Lefkowitz, though, had a full picture of Citi Equity's operations, 
employees said. The company's offices were spread over three buildings, and 
there was little interaction among Citi Equity's small staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forget the right hand not knowing what the left was doing," said one 
employee. "The index finger didn't know what the pinky was doing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lefkowitz built in a decade what appeared to be an impressive real estate 
empire. He was the general partner in more than 300 limited partnerships and an 
officer of more than 50 companies. 
</P>
<P>
 He obtained tax credits in 22 states for 100 low-income housing projects and 
syndicated 80 limited partnerships for those projects, raising $100 million 
from investors. Citi Equity raised an additional $30 million in mortgage pools 
that provided short-term construction financing. 
</P>
<P>
 But federal authorities allege that the firm was built on a mountain of 
deceit. Central to the scam, they allege, was Lefkowitz's claim that he could 
offer developers permanent financing. 
</P>
<P>
 To obtain property, Lefkowitz had to convince builders that Citi Equity had 
permanent, or "take out," financing. Such funds are used to take builders out 
of projects by repaying their construction loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Lefkowitz showed developers what purported to be financing commitment letters, 
primarily from Axon Associates and Jericho State Capital Corp. The two New York 
firms arrange financing for investments in real estate limited partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 But the indictment alleges that Axon and Jericho had an agreement with 
Lefkowitz that the commitments never would be exercised. The letters' purpose, 
prosecutors charge, was solely to induce builders to turn their projects over 
to Citi Equity. 
</P>
<P>
 An Axon official said the firm, which does not face any charges in the case, 
is cooperating with authorities. Officials of Jericho could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The commitment letters also were used to convince brokers to sell the limited 
partnerships and mortgage pool units to investors, prosecutors say. 
Prospectuses, however, failed to disclose information about Lefkowitz's 
background, including his Bar suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 Lefkowitz also used deception to delay closings on properties, the indictment 
charges, filing numerous frivolous lawsuits against developers that alleged 
construction defects that did not exist. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In March, 1989, John Goodin and several partners bought 24 acres on the 
western edge of Sandusky, a small Ohio town on the shores of Lake Erie. They 
planned to build 200 units of luxury apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 The group originally intended to keep and operate the project. But with 
permanent financing difficult to find and Goodin facing other financial 
pressures, the partners agreed to sell in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 They decided that the project would be more attractive if converted to 
low-income housing. Goodin applied for tax credits from the Ohio Housing 
Finance Agency and went looking for a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Southern California syndicators surfaced. First, Goodin negotiated with 
Michael Leone of San Diego, but their deal was never finalized. With time 
running out late in 1990 -- the tax credits would expire by year's end -- he 
turned to Lefkowitz. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 30, Lefkowitz flew to Columbus. He quickly agreed to buy the project 
and another in Delaware, Ohio. But Goodin's partners, Les Compson and Paul and 
Ray Bouman, soon learned of one peculiarity of the sale: Citi Equity would take 
over the project and collect $80,000 a month in rent for several months before 
the closing. 
</P>
<P>
 They had good reason to worry. The sale was not closed on schedule, and Leone 
filed suit alleging that he had a valid contract on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, though later dismissed, clouded the property's title. Meanwhile, 
Goodin and his partners were personally on the hook for $5.8 million in loans. 
But with no access to the property and its cash flow, they could not pay the 
bank and their subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to raise capital, the Boumans were forced to sell a Chevrolet 
dealership that they had owned for 20 years. They also were forced to sell 
another property and fight off foreclosure on their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This put a big, black cloud over our lives," said Paul Bouman. 
</P>
<P>
 The partners sued Lefkowitz; in early 1992, an Ohio judge gave Citi Equity 120 
days to complete the sale. The afternoon before the deadline, Goodin killed 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale did not close as scheduled, and the Bouman group later filed another 
suit. Although the property had been occupied by tenants for two years, 
Lefkowitz replied that he did not complete the purchase because the property 
was shoddy. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they built is a piece of junk and that's the problem," Lefkowitz 
testified in a deposition in January. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his deposition, Schwartz said that claim was just a ruse by Lefkowitz 
to delay closing because he lacked financing. "Mr. Lefkowitz was proud of the 
property," Schwartz testified. "He kept referring to it as a brochure property 
-- to take a picture of it, put it on a brochure." 
</P>
<P>
 In March, an Erie County jury ruled in favor of the Boumans, awarding them a 
$7.2-million judgment against Citi Equity and Lefkowitz. They still are trying 
to collect; Citi Equity was forced into bankruptcy reorganization the day after 
Lefkowitz's indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When an FBI agent contacted Paul Bouman in May, 1993, the developer learned 
that he was not alone in fighting Lefkowitz. According to Bouman, the agent 
told him that Citi Equity had left a trail of ruined developers across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Johnson, owner of Citadel Construction of Spokane, Wash., was not paid 
for work on projects in Spokane and Boise, Idaho. The company recently won a 
$2-million award from Citi Equity in arbitration hearings -- an award that the 
firm hopes to collect by foreclosing on the projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lefkowitz came close to driving Citadel out of business," said the firm's 
attorney, Lyn Rassmussen. 
</P>
<P>
 In Elk River, Minn., developer John Welcht built and sold the 51-unit Park 
Pointe Apartments to Citi Equity, but despite a court judgment, he never 
collected the $1.3 million that he was owed on the sale. Citi Equity avoided 
foreclosure on the project by putting its operating limited partnership in 
bankruptcy reorganization. In all, 21 Citi Equity projects have filed for 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 All together, about 25 properties that Lefkowitz syndicated were not 
completed, according to bankruptcy court records. 
</P>
<P>
 In Maumee, Ohio, a suburb of Toledo, developer Ken Minichiello said he boarded 
up a project that was 80% complete because Citi Equity owed him $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in a very tenuous situation," said Minichiello, owner of Commonwealth 
Construction. "I could be forced into bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
 The stalled project means that 160 needy Toledo-area families are being denied 
affordable housing in an area where several thousand are on waiting lists for 
public housing or subsidized rental units. 
</P>
<P>
 "The demand for low-income housing is overwhelming," said Donald Troendle, 
executive director of the Lucas (Co.) Metropolitan Housing Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors in the Maumee project also are in jeopardy. The indictment alleges 
that Lefkowitz improperly dispensed tax credits before the project was 
finished. An Internal Revenue Service spokesman said investors could be forced 
to repay any credits taken, along with interest and penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Batman, a retired piano teacher from Hudson, Ohio, invested $60,000 in 
three Citi Equity projects. Interest payments on all three projects stopped in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 While Batman's financial security is not dependent on these investments, their 
loss would be painful. "I'm hoping it will work out all right," she said. "I 
don't like to give my money away." 
</P>
<P>
 The First Presbyterian Church in Mankato, Minn., invested $78,000 from the 
sale of a parsonage in three Lefkowitz developments. A church member who was a 
broker for a Minneapolis securities firm recommended the investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastor Steve Minnema fears that a $50,000 investment in a part-finished 
project is lost because Citi Equity never filed the mortgage deed securing the 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were assured it was a safe investment," said Minnema. "We felt we were 
doing some good, putting it in low-income housing." The Alleged Lefkowitz 
Scheme 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-count federal indictment against Gary W. Lefkowitz, owner and president 
of Citi Equity Group, alleges that he used a complex scheme to illegally divert 
up to $50 million from developers, investors and the U.S. government for his 
own personal and business use. Here is how the scheme allegedly worked: 
</P>
<P>
 THE DEVELOPERS 
</P>
<P>
 * Lefkowitz entered agreements to acquire apartment complexes or to have 
developers build projects that were converted to low-income housing. The 
projects would be partly financed using federal tax credits obtained from state 
housing agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * The sales contracts called for closings six months or more from the date of 
the purchase agreements. Contracts typically included "benefit and burden" 
clauses that allowed Citi Equity to take over management and collect rents 
before the closings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lefkowitz induced developers to sell projects by fraudulently representing 
that the permanent financing was in place. He produced bogus commitment letters 
for permanent financing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Closings were often delayed because of a lack of financing. Lefkowitz filed 
"frivolous lawsuits" against developers that said construction defects existed 
that prevented completion of the sales. He presented phony letters saying 
financing was being withdrawn because of shoddy construction. 
</P>
<P>
 * When judgments were issued against him or foreclosure actions begun, he 
placed projects in bankruptcy, further frustrating developers' efforts to 
collect debts. Twenty-one projects are in bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lefkowitz improperly transferred funds from profitable to unprofitable 
projects, and diverted money to pay for personal expenses. The diversions meant 
that some developers were not paid and projects not completed. 
</P>
<P>
 THE INVESTORS 
</P>
<P>
 * Citi Equity raised about $100 million from investors in more than 80 limited 
partnerships to purchase and develop more than 100 low-income housing projects. 
Lefkowitz also obtained $30 million from investors in mortgage pools that 
provided short-term construction financing for the projects. About 7,000 
individuals nationwide invested money in Citi Equity properties. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lefkowitz recruited about 100 securities brokers and dealers nationwide to 
sell his limited partnerships and mortgage investments. He misrepresented to 
the brokers how the partnership and mortgage funds would be used. 
</P>
<P>
 * He violated his fiduciary duty as general partner by embezzling partnership 
funds and diverting them for personal use. From 1989 to 1993, Lefkowitz spent 
$4.2 million in partnership and mortgage funds on clothes, jewelry and his 
homes. He misrepresented the diverted funds as loans. 
</P>
<P>
 * Funds were transferred from profitable partnerships to unprofitable ones at 
Lefkowitz's direction. As a result, some projects were not built and tax 
credits sold to investors rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lefkowitz violated mortgage loan agreements by using investor funds to pay 
for personal and business expenses. In some cases, he failed to record mortgage 
deeds, providing investors no security in case of default. 
</P>
<P>
 * In disclosure statements to investors, he failed to provide vital 
information, including his 1989 Bar suspension. He also misrepresented his 
background to brokers and financiers. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOVERNMENT 
</P>
<P>
 * Lefkowitz filed tax credit applications in at least five states that falsely 
said a New York nonprofit group was a general partner in Citi Equity-sponsored 
partnerships. States set aside certain tax credits for nonprofit groups. As a 
result, $8 million in tax credits were improperly reserved for Citi Equity. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lefkowitz falsely presented dates that properties were placed in service to 
claim tax credits not awarded. He directed false partnership tax returns to be 
prepared. City Equity thus obtained $5 million in tax credits in at least eight 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lefkowitz improperly claimed $3 million in tax credits that Citi Equity did 
not own. 
</P>
<P>
 * He fraudulently classified as loans millions of dollars in compensation not 
reported as income on his federal personal income tax returns.

AVON IS CALLING, AND IT'S A JUNGLE OUT THERE; BRAZIL: WOMEN FIND INDEPENDENCE 
DOING BIG BUSINESS IN THE AMAZON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elisa Maria Rodrigues doesn't ring her customers' doorbells, because in the 
middle of the Amazon jungle there aren't any. Many times there aren't even any 
doors, just stick-frame houses covered with big, black plastic tarps or dried 
palm fronds. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as she and thousands of Brazilian women like her make their way across 
rivers, down dusty roads, up hills and through swamps to the homes and habitats 
of gold miners, prostitutes, farmers and others trying to scratch out a living, 
the refrain is one familiar to Americans for about 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the Avon lady." 
</P>
<P>
 Every day in Brazil, a small army of women armed with Bart Simpson deodorant 
and Eros and Topaz colognes spread out through the world's most dense 
vegetation, hawking their wares in remote places like this mosquito-infested 
gold-mining camp and scores of other small towns and villages accessible only 
by water or air. 
</P>
<P>
 In canoes, on riverboats and aboard small, propeller-driven aircraft, they 
venture to the unlikeliest places, selling products to the unlikeliest of 
people and with the most surprising results -- tens of millions of dollars in 
sales. For Avon, this Amazon sales force, which is beginning to take on 
legendary proportions and is even being considered as the subject of a major 
motion picture, has proven an unexpected boon. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Avon's Amazon sales force accounted for $70 million, 15% of the 
company's $465 million in sales nationally. Brazil is now the largest single 
market outside of the United States for Avon, which recorded $3.8 billion in 
sales worldwide in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economists thought we were crazy to go to the Amazon, and they're right 
if you analyze the economic indicators," said Avon Brazil's president, Ademar 
Serodio. "People (there) live in places where there are no banks, no 
infrastructure, no major employers and payments are made through bartered 
goods." 
</P>
<P>
 Avon discovered, however, that it was exactly for those reasons that it was 
successful. The company's flexible system allowed representatives to be paid in 
chickens, eggs, gold, fruit, vegetables or services. And because these remote 
communities were so cut off from commerce, they contained the pent-up demand of 
potential consumers who wanted to look and smell good. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody thinks a miner is like an animal," said Juarez Araujao Limas, 36, 
covered with rust-colored dirt as he tried to wrestle grams of gold out of the 
ground in the sweltering heat of Patrocinio. "But we're normal people who want 
normal products like everybody else. Nobody likes to get next to a good-looking 
girl smelling bad." 
</P>
<P>
 They'd better not, said Eliene da Silva Costa, a 20-year-old prostitute and 
Avon customer in one of the four brothels that serve Patrocinio. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a guy is smelling, we send him away," Costa said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Amazon market, growing at 50% annually, has been a huge plus for the 
world's largest cosmetics company, it has been an even greater blessing to the 
company's 42,000 regional representatives, part of Avon Brazil's 400,000-strong 
national sales force. 
</P>
<P>
 In a country where the vast majority of women are confined to menial jobs, 
particularly in undeveloped rural areas, the opportunity to work independently 
in a more professional setting has been as much a psychological as economic 
boost for thousands of women. It has awakened in them abilities that many did 
not know they possessed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women who had nothing are learning for the first time to be independent, that 
they can have control of their lives," said Maria das Gracas Gomes, 44, who 
manages 1,000 sales representatives in an Amazon area slightly larger than 
Austria. "They learn to relate better to other people, to find (their) own 
place in society. It was the same thing I discovered in myself -- that I was 
capable of doing things that I didn't think of before." 
</P>
<P>
 These saleswomen, who operate entirely on a 30% commission, make $250 to $700 
a month -- figures far above the regional average and in many cases higher than 
the national average. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is a tough way to make a living. 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling through the region is difficult at best. The saleswomen must venture 
down treacherous rivers to pick up products and make deliveries. Periodically, 
boats capsize and representatives lose their products, and sometimes more. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, three people were killed and one Avon representative barely 
survived when their small boat went over a waterfall after the boat lost its 
engine as they were venturing upriver to make a pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 And bandits are always lurking, so salespeople go in armed. Three Avon 
representatives have been robbed and killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The most dangerous areas are the rough-and-tumble mining camps, places like 
Abacaxi or Castelo de Sonhos (Castle of Dreams), which resemble a scene from a 
Clint Eastwood Western. Almost weekly, one of the camp's many pistol-packing 
miners ends up dead after a saloon brawl or an argument over a mining claim. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also constant concern about malaria. "Nobody who stays there for a 
week escapes malaria," said Rossimar Pareira da Silva, 39, who makes deliveries 
to the camps for his wife because of the dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the secluded mines, people pay higher prices and they pay in gold. 
"That's why sometimes the sellers take the risks," Da Silva said. "You get the 
gold, and then you resell it." 
</P>
<P>
 Women like Fatima Vasques are willing to take the risk. Vasques, 28, began 
selling Avon four years ago, not long after her husband, a pilot, was killed in 
a plane crash. A housewife since age 15, she was left with an 8-year-old son, a 
2-year-old daughter, little education and no working experience. Life as a 
poorly paid maid, she said, seemed her only option. 
</P>
<P>
 But today she makes $300 a month, nearly twice as much as a beginning 
schoolteacher in Rio de Janeiro. She no longer goes door to door or ventures 
into the mining camps -- she has her own network of women to do that. She rents 
space at the local airport, where she sells Avon and other products. 
</P>
<P>
 "And right now, I'm in the process of opening a small store," she said, 
sitting outside a restaurant in Itaituba, a small river city that serves as a 
supply center for many of the gold-mining camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Her success with Avon, she says, has brought about a personal awakening that 
has led her to other business ventures. When Vasques strides through town these 
days, people address her as "Dona" Fatima, a Brazilian title of respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Award-winning screenwriter Jane Anderson, an American who lives in Los 
Angeles, said she saw such change repeatedly as she toured the countryside 
talking to saleswomen in preparation for a script she would write about them 
for MGM/Universal Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first got the project, I said to myself, What is this -- exploitation 
of these women by a corporation?" said Anderson, who wrote the television movie 
"The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom" 
and the current feature film "It Could Happen To You." 
</P>
<P>
 "But I was deeply, deeply impressed (with) how this dinosaur of a product has 
done more for feminism in Brazil than anything. I saw women who had achieved a 
degree of independence, of dignity, who had been able to create for themselves 
a wonderful life." 
</P>
<P>
 Avon Brazil President Serodio says that has been one of the most rewarding 
parts of the Amazon project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredible to see a woman who for years was told that she was nothing, 
who has had almost nothing and then coming back and believing in herself." 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is, 'Thank God for Avon,' " said Maria do Carno da Silva Gomes, 
beaming as sunlight streamed through the space between the boards of her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomes, 36, began selling Avon cosmetics shortly after she and her family of 
six moved 4 1/2 years ago to Itaituba, where her husband had planned to open an 
auto repair shop. The shop failed and Gomes, who had never held a job, turned 
to Avon to help feed her family of six. Now, she makes nearly double her 
husband's $180-a-month wage as a city auto mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
 "His salary is tiny," Gomes said, squeezing two fingers together to illustrate 
her point. "He's sometimes jealous that I make more money, but I think he's 
very grateful that I'm able to help out." 
</P>
<P>
 Gomes picks up her cosmetics at a local drop-off point in Itaituba after they 
come downriver by boat from Santarem. She then heads off to shops and 
communities in the surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
 In a local agricultural community, farmers pay her in rice and chickens, which 
she either keeps or resells for cash. Periodically, she wraps up packages for 
the gold miners, marking each bundle's price as one, two or three grams of 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
 The packets are passed on to another woman, who hitches a ride downriver and 
takes a small boat to a mosquito-infested mining camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling, ordering and accounting for the supplies, Gomes said, has made her a 
"businesswoman" -- a title she relishes -- and given her a cherished 
independence. "When you don't earn your own money, you have to ask your husband 
for the money," she said. "When people earn money, then they can buy presents 
and things for whomever. It is a marvelous feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Last November, she bought a car, a 1980 Volkswagen Beetle -- even though she 
doesn't know how to drive. It is mostly her husband who uses the car, but Gomes 
and her 14-year-old daughter often go to the dirt road in front of their small 
wood-frame home and try to teach each other the mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomes said she thinks that her children, three girls and a boy, will benefit 
from her personal evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that my children can learn that they can have control over their 
lives," she said. "They can look at me and see that they have ability, that 
they are capable."

CULTURAL DIVIDE AT GUANTANAMO POSES CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS B. ROSENSTIEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As one of the elected leaders of Haitian Camp No. 4, Declacin St. Paulin vows 
he is prepared to live in the U.S. military tent city here for years if 
necessary, as long as it takes for his country to be liberated. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new Cuban camp erected on the other side of the point on the 
southeastern coast of Cuba, Jesus Diaz, a 31-year-old engineer from Havana, 
says staying here very long is inconceivable. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference may reflect the impact of time on the two, quite different 
communities -- Haitian and Cuban -- being established at the United States' 
oldest overseas military base. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Paulin fled Haiti more than two months ago and has come to regard the idle 
days, sweltering tents and aluminum-and-nylon cots as home. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz and his fellow Cuban boat people have been here less than a week, since 
President Clinton declared he would not grant political asylum to the thousands 
fleeing their country after Cuban leader Fidel Castro began allowing escapes by 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
 But their different attitudes also reflect starkly different cultures and 
circumstances between the 14,000 Haitians and the roughly equal number of 
Cubans who have transformed this once sleepy paradise of a naval base into a 
massive refugee camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Those two cultures present different sets of challenges for the roughly 6,000 
U.S. troops who are responsible for running the camps and who are expected to 
turn the base into a canvas-tent metropolis of perhaps 70,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 A remarkable number of the Cubans are professionals -- lawyers, doctors, 
teachers, dentists, engineers. Camp Alpha, one of the Cuban camps, has 26 
doctors among its approximately 2,000 residents, according to its leader, 
Reynoldo Valido. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Haitians spread across seven camps, U.S. officials have identified 
no doctors, said the officer in charge of the Haitian operation, Col. Michael 
A. Pearson. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Cubans, the most serious crime so far has been cutting in line for 
food, said Army Capt. Brian Feser, the commander of the Cuban camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Haitians, there have been cases of rape, assault, theft and more. 
U.S. soldiers have been hurt, though not seriously, breaking up fights, said 
Brig. Gen. Mike Williams, commander of the task force in charge of the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances each group has left behind are different as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In a story repeated in various forms throughout Camp Alpha and the other Cuban 
areas, Valido says he had a large house and a good wage as a teacher in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 His head tilted in worry over conditions at the camp, his blue eyes reddened 
with exhaustion, he says he left to gain intellectual freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main repression was here, in the mind. When you teach the children in 
Cuba, as I did, you must speak what Castro says. You never speak your own 
words. That is the biggest jail. The jail of the mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are a math teacher and someone says something in class that is 
considered politically improper, you must stop teaching math and have a 
discussion about politics and what is proper political philosophy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The jail of the mind was stifling enough, apparently, for Valido and the 
others to set out across the Florida Straits with children and babies in craft 
that most Americans would not take into a swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The stories each Haitian tells are more horrible. 
</P>
<P>
 Menar Medat, the 24-year-old president of Camp 6, fled Haiti and had to leave 
his wife and child behind after his house was burned to the ground and he was 
hunted for being a supporter of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, his wife and child do not know if he died at sea. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a story heard over and over. "Where is your family?" a visitor asks a 
10-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father dead. My brother dead." 
</P>
<P>
 "Where is your mother?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know. Maybe dead." 
</P>
<P>
 "How did you get to Guantanamo?" 
</P>
<P>
 "My older brother." 
</P>
<P>
 For these Haitians, there is only one way to return home: revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 14,000 Haitians here, only 71 qualify for political asylum or 
immigration. The others await the return of Aristide or an offer of haven in 
some other country. 
</P>
<P>
 There are Cubans in these camps who can recite the wording of the latest 
resolutions from the U.S. Senate about their situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitians, for the most part, believe that having lived under military 
strongmen, Bill Clinton is the biggest strongman of all, and that he could 
decide who is president of Haiti with a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton is the one holding the power in Haiti," said Henry Claude, leader of 
Haitian Camp 5. "All problems are because of the white man," said Cola Joubert, 
a resident of Camp 4. "Every time you promise to do something for Haiti, 
nothing ever happens." 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't ever tell them the U.S. cannot help them," said Staff Sgt. Fritz 
Beauzile, an Army translator who was born in Haiti and lived there until age 
11. "To them, the U.S. is like God. Deeply inside their hearts, they believe 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Beauzile now lives in Ft. Stewart, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Haitian camps, protests and demonstrations are common. A particular 
issue is food. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. troops have tried yams, pork and beans, baked beans and found nothing 
that everyone from the various regions of Haiti will eat. They are now down to 
red beans and rice with either beef, pork or chicken and have enlisted 28 
Haitians to help with the cooking, but that still has not helped. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest demonstration, a three-day hunger strike among 60 Haitians that 
ended Saturday, protested the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Food among the Haitians is passed out in a controlled area fenced off by 
barbed wire to maintain security. Food among the Cubans is handed out to 
designated representatives, who in turn hand it out among the other Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a great deal of discontent and a great deal of frustration 
as well" among the Haitians, Williams acknowledged, though he characterized 
that as not unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 It raises the question whether time, familiarity and the rising expectations 
that go along with thinking of a tent camp as a community will bring similar 
frustrations among the Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, then this base, "a little bit of paradise," in the words of one 
soldier, itself may well become a tense, permanent refuge on the edge of 
communist Cuba.

U.S. SIGNALS CUBA IT'S READY TO DEAL; REFUGEES: SECRETARY OF STATE SAYS 
ADMINISTRATION MAY EASE RESTRICTIONS ON LEGAL IMMIGRATION. STATEMENT APPEARS 
MEANT TO ENCOURAGE PROGRESS AT UPCOMING TALKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Sunday sent a signal outlining a 
possible U.S. deal with Cuba on migration, saying the Clinton Administration 
may allow more Cubans to enter the United States through legal immigration if 
Fidel Castro agrees to stop his citizens from going to sea in rafts. 
</P>
<P>
 In a television interview, Christopher suggested that the Administration is 
willing to change current policies, broaden the categories of Cubans who can 
immigrate legally and speed up the processing of their applications if that 
will help end the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 His statement was the clearest public signal yet of the Administration's 
willingness to meet one of Castro's longstanding demands: easier legal 
emigration for discontented Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're quite prepared to talk to them about legal, lawful migration to the 
United States, how to make that more effective, what categories of people can 
come in to the United States," Christopher said on the CBS-TV program "Face the 
Nation." "We're quite prepared to consider lawful migration, perhaps enhanced 
lawful migration, if they're prepared to stop the unlawful migration." 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, U.S. immigration policy has granted legal entry only to about 3,000 
Cubans a year in three categories: those with close relatives already in the 
country, those with needed skills or those with a documented history of 
political persecution. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, U.S. law allows Cubans who enter the country 
illegally to stay and apply for refugee status. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro has long complained that the effect of that policy was to encourage 
illegal emigration, including boat and aircraft hijackings. Earlier this month, 
when Cubans rioted over economic problems and emigration restrictions, Castro 
announced that his government would no longer stop citizens from going to sea 
-- producing an exodus of more than 17,000 Cubans in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Clinton Administration proposed formal talks with Cuba on the 
immigration problem, and the negotiations are expected to begin in New York on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's statement appears aimed at encouraging the Cubans to come to the 
talks ready to make a deal that could help end the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want them to know that we are serious about having substantive, productive 
talks," a Christopher aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Castro has used the crisis to renew his demand for a lifting of the 
three-decade-old U.S. trade embargo on Cuba, experts say they believe that his 
real objectives are far more modest: easier legal emigration, U.S. prosecution 
of Cubans who make it to Florida in stolen aircraft or boats, and restoration 
of permission for Cuban Americans to send money to relatives on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Castro took a small step toward reimposing control over seaborne 
emigration from Cuba, announcing that he has ordered his coast guard to stop 
people from taking children to sea on unsafe boats and rafts. 
</P>
<P>
 An order signed by Castro said the measure was taken to protect the lives of 
Cubans who are too young to have "the capacity to decide for themselves," the 
Reuters news agency reported from Havana. 
</P>
<P>
 An unknown number of refugees, apparently including some children, have died 
after setting to sea on flimsy homemade rafts made of inner tubes, Styrofoam 
and wood. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the number of rafters found in the Florida Straits slowed even 
further Sunday, apparently because of scattered showers and choppy seas. 
</P>
<P>
 By evening, only 61 Cubans had been plucked from the 90-mile stretch of sea 
separating Cuba and Florida, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro's order said the Cuban coast guard will patrol territorial waters 
within 12 miles of the island's coast to "provide help if necessary" for people 
aboard rafts and boats but will not arrest them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration welcomed the action as an apparent step in the 
right direction. "If the Cuban government is taking steps to discourage illegal 
migration that puts Cuban citizens at great risk, then we would welcome that 
development as consistent with our view," State Department spokesman Mike 
McCurry said. 
</P>
<P>
 The emigration crisis has thus placed Castro and Clinton in paradoxical 
positions: Castro is now actively assisting Cubans who want to flee to the 
United States, and Clinton is implicitly asking him to use his repressive 
police forces to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro wants to allow discontented Cubans to leave as a "safety valve" that 
removes potentially dangerous dissidents from the island, but he does not 
relish the damaging image of his countrymen fleeing desperately on rafts. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a 1984 accord, the United States agreed to admit 27,845 Cubans each year 
as legal immigrants, but in practice the U.S. government has admitted only a 
small fraction of that number. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's statement suggested the basis of a deal that could serve the 
interests of both sides: The Administration could broaden the categories of 
Cubans allowed to enter, thus increasing the number. In return, Castro could 
order his police and coast guard to resume discouraging people from leaving 
illegally on boats and rafts. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher also held out a slim signal of hope to Castro on a broader issue: 
the Cuban leader's desire for wide-ranging talks with the United States toward 
normalizing political relations and lifting the trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he moves toward democracy in a tangible, significant way, we'll respond in 
a carefully calibrated way," Christopher said. But he refused to offer any 
specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 But Christopher repeated the Administration's insistence that this week's 
talks on immigration will not be allowed to spill over into broader issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "On other subjects, we really don't have very much to say to Castro. He knows 
what he needs to do," Christopher said. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary of state said firmly that the Administration is not considering 
a naval blockade of the island, despite calls for one from conservative 
Republicans and Cuban Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not favor a blockade at the present time. It is not contemplated. We 
seek peaceful change," Christopher said. "We think a naval blockade can lead 
toward confrontation. It's an act of war." Last week, White House Chief of 
Staff Leon E. Panetta said such a blockade might be an option. 
</P>
<P>
 But this week, most criticism of the Administration has come from the opposite 
direction -- from both Republicans and Democrats who argue that Clinton is 
making a mistake when he rules out broader political negotiations with Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), a leading Republican foreign policy spokesman, 
said Clinton should offer to gradually lift the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba in 
exchange for the release of political prisoners and other moves toward 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of experience in recent years about how you move a communist 
country to freedom -- and the lesson of that is to broaden and to intensify 
contacts," Hamilton said. "Let's open up Cuba just as much as we can." Both 
legislators were interviewed Sunday on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.), a leading conservative, and liberal Sens. 
Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) have made similar 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton promised Cuban American leaders in Florida, a battleground state 
in the 1992 presidential election, that he would not open talks with Castro, 
and he has kept that promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Connie Mack (R-Fla.) said the reasons for refusing to deal with Castro 
had not changed. "This man is a thug. He's a killer. He's a communist."

STUDY SHOWS DRUG ABUSE PROGRAMS ARE COST-EFFECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For every dollar spent on treatment for drug and alcohol abuse, California 
taxpayers reap $7 in savings, mostly due to reductions in crime and health care 
costs, a new statewide survey has found. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost-benefit analysis, billed as the most comprehensive ever conducted in 
the United States, also confirmed what smaller studies have shown: Treatment is 
highly effective, regardless of the type of program or the drug, and success 
cuts across all racial and socioeconomic lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, financed by the state but conducted by an independent research 
institute, comes at a time of great public skepticism over the benefits of such 
social programs. There was intense debate over whether President Clinton's 
health care reform should cover treatment; ultimately, it was included. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important that there be a continuously developing database to 
demonstrate to the American public the cost effectiveness of drug abuse 
treatment," said Alan Leshner, director of the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse, an arm of the National Institutes of Health. "Most people don't believe 
treatment works, and they're wrong. That's why a study like this is so 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 The study, which will be released today by the California Department of 
Alcohol and Drug Programs, estimated that $1.5 billion in savings resulted from 
the $209 million the state spent on treatment between October, 1991 and 
September, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Declared Andrew Mecca, director of the department: "This is what I call 
slam-dunk evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 In the year before treatment, the study found, those who later would be 
enrolled in drug abuse programs cost state taxpayers $3.1 billion. Of that, 
$2.4 billion -- or 70% -- was attributed to crime, including the cost of police 
protection, prosecution and incarceration. Victims of crimes committed by drug 
abusers, meanwhile, incurred $1.3 billion in medical costs, damaged or stolen 
property and lost work. Health care for drug abusers totaled $442 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen months after treatment, the cost of crimes tied to the group in 
treatment had dropped by $1 billion, the study said, accounting for the biggest 
chunk of savings. The study also found a considerable drop in health care 
expenditures; emergency room admissions, for instance, decreased by one-third 
after treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The study based these conclusions on subjects' recollections of their behavior 
-- including crimes they committed -- before and after they had undergone 
treatment. But the authors say they took pains to avoid exaggerating savings, 
noting that previous research had shown such self-reporting to be "as valid as 
drug testing." 
</P>
<P>
 One sobering finding in the study was that treatment was of little help in 
getting drug abusers on more stable economic footing. Treatment did not lead to 
employment, although the research did find that the longer participants stayed 
in treatment, the more likely they were to find a job afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Mecca, Leshner and other experts say they hope to use the $2-million study to 
persuade skeptical elected officials that they should continue to invest public 
money in drug abuse treatment. In this regard, the research may prove more a 
benefit to states other than California, which has already increased annual 
spending on treatment by nearly $120 million since the study was conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found that use of crack cocaine, cocaine powder and amphetamines 
declined by almost half after treatment, while heroin use declined by more than 
one-fifth and alcohol use by nearly one-third. The findings about crack abuse 
surprised the study's authors, who said they did not expect to learn that it 
could be treated so effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has really determined that previously," said Dean R. Gerstein of the 
University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center, which conducted the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 While the essential conclusion of the report -- that treatment works and saves 
money -- came as no surprise to those in the field, experts say the study is 
especially important because it was so rigorously conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time that I've seen the return on the investment so clearly 
laid out," said M. Douglas Anglin, director of the UCLA Drug Abuse Research 
Center, which was not involved in conducting the study. "Now, we can really be 
confident when we pound on our lecterns and say treatment works." 
</P>
<P>
 While previous research has looked at only a handful of treatment centers -- 
often focusing on those considered model programs -- the California study 
employed random sampling methods to draw a complete picture of 146,515 people 
enrolled in an array of programs throughout the state's 58 counties. 
</P>
<P>
 And while other studies have tracked people for 60 or 90 days after treatment, 
the California study interviewed 1,857 subjects 15 months after treatment had 
concluded. The participants will continue to be followed, Mecca said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Leshner of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, smaller studies 
have shown a benefit of anywhere from $4 to $20 for every dollar invested. 
Thus, the California study's finding of $7 in savings for every dollar spent 
puts it on the conservative end of the research spectrum.

O.C. LEGISLATOR, GUN LOBBY DUEL OVER SCHOOL VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She makes no bones about it -- this is a personal battle for Doris Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 It began with her granddaughter. The Republican assemblywoman from Cypress 
couldn't believe the treatment that the bright, blond-haired girl was enduring 
at school. First, the 14-year-old got roughed up at a dance. Not long after, a 
few girls tried to set her hair on fire with a cigarette lighter. 
</P>
<P>
 For protection, the granddaughter fell in with the "skaters," a clique of 
skateboard fanatics in her northern San Diego County neighborhood. The girl's 
grades plummeted, her attitude soured. She turned around only after her 
desperate parents moved the family to Helena, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
 Aghast that such a thing could happen, and all too aware that her 
granddaughter's plight was being replicated in countless other California 
schools, Allen decided to help the only way she could. She began pushing a 
slate of laws through the Legislature designed to quell violence on public 
school campuses throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Legislature ready to close shop at midnight Wednesday, Allen's 
measures are in the final stretch. It appears all four of her top bills could 
win final approval and reach the desk of Gov. Pete Wilson, who is expected to 
sign them. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Allen's legislative campaign against school violence has locked 
her in a pitched -- and highly personal -- battle with Sacramento's powerful 
gun lobby. The state's leading voice against gun control, Gun Owners of 
California Inc., was founded by former state Sen. H.L. (Bill) Richardson, who 
is related to Allen through the marriage of their children -- the parents of 
the granddaughter harassed at school. 
</P>
<P>
 But the assemblywoman's crusade also has won her broad support from parents, 
principals and police officers. During the past year, Allen has held forums in 
Orange County on the topic of campus violence, and what she learned was 
startling. 
</P>
<P>
 In the county, for instance, 400 students have been expelled from schools in 
the past three years for carrying weapons. Many forum attendees told her that 
the problem of weapons on campus is no longer limited to gang members or 
disturbed youths: Many students are arming themselves because of fear of 
attack. One in 12 pupils nationwide has admitted staying home on occasion due 
to fears of assault. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were having these same problems in the inner cities for years, but no one 
was doing anything about it," Allen said. "Now it has spread to suburbia. It's 
shocking to learn some of the problems that are occurring." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the legislative solutions proposed by Allen are: 
</P>
<P>
 * A "zero tolerance" policy (AB 1045) that would require expulsion of students 
caught with drugs or weapons on campus. Expelled students would be sent to 
special "community schools" to continue their education under tight 
supervision. Allen calls the bill, which is on the governor's desk, "the most 
important school safety bill of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 * Legislation (AB 2752) inspired by several Huntington Beach High School 
students that directs schools to punish pupils for racist hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 * A bill (AB 1308) that toughens vagrancy laws on campuses so administrators 
have a more effective tool to combat gang members from other schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * Establishment of a 1,000-foot "gun-free zone" (AB 645) around school 
grounds. Violators could face felony charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The bills would go a long way toward curbing some of the violence that has 
crept into school life, said John F. Dean, Orange County superintendent of 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're supportive of virtually anything that will protect the safety of kids 
on campus or within the campus range," Dean said. "Our job is education, but 
the kids have to know they're in a safe zone." 
</P>
<P>
 While all of Allen's bills have gone through a gantlet of hearings and house 
votes, the measure calling for a gun-free zone has lately been the toughest 
political fight. 
</P>
<P>
 It has also been a battle between grandparents who normally see eye to eye on 
gun issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson and Gun Owners of California argue that Allen's measure would 
effectively criminalize law-abiding citizens living within the zone who wish to 
have a gun for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, who calls herself a "100% Second Amendment" supporter, contends there 
are allowances in the measure for residents near schools to have a gun in the 
home. The bill, she says, is intended to curb drive-by shootings and other 
violence that often mars neighborhoods around schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In an Aug. 18 letter to Allen, Richardson said a representative of Gun Owners 
of California had made it clear in a meeting with the assemblywoman six months 
earlier that the group opposed the 1,000-foot zone. He called it "arbitrary" 
and said his group wants "to encourage, not discourage responsible gun 
ownership." 
</P>
<P>
 "Just drive by Sacramento or McClatchy High Schools (in Sacramento County)," 
Richardson wrote. "There is no way reasonable folks would live within 1000 feet 
without owning several guns!!" 
</P>
<P>
 The letter also had a personal postscript from one grandparent to another: "If 
this had been the law in Montana, our kids would have been potential felons." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen responded the next day with a letter of her own chastising Gun Owners 
for not carefully reading the bill, suggesting that the group's representative 
failed to note any opposition in the earlier meeting and calling the efforts of 
Richardson and his staff "professionally unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 She, too, added a postscript: "Regarding Montana, even though our kids are 
legal gun owners, they still would have been perfectly safe under the 
provisions of AB 645." 
</P>
<P>
 Their differences erupted last week when Gun Owners of California attempted to 
sabotage Allen's bill. The group asked state Sen. Don Rogers (R-Tehachapi) to 
pull the school safety bill from the Senate's consent calendar, where it was 
pretty much guaranteed to win approval. But after a heated round of lobbying, 
Allen managed to save the bill, which is now on the governor's desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Miffed by the episode, the assemblywoman had retribution to extract. To the 
dismay of the gun lobby, Allen cast the deciding vote to push a bill banning 
copycat assault weapons out of a key committee. Declaring that "intimidation 
and bullying does not make it with me," Allen said she decided to look at the 
assault weapon bill "in a little different light." 
</P>
<P>
 And the battle has not yet stopped. The gun lobby now is pushing for 
amendments to Allen's school vagrancy law (AB 1308), a move the assemblywoman 
considers "hostile." The lobby's effort could doom the measure for procedural 
reasons because legislative leaders this year are frowning on the introduction 
of major amendments at the close of session. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if that happens, Allen has vowed to not give up the fight. She plans to 
continue her mission to crack down on school violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to leave it alone," she said. "These are problems that all our 
kids face."

POPULATION CONCLAVE FACES SHARP CLASHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The stage is set for a confrontation between two world views -- one secular, 
another sacred -- when 180 nations gather in Cairo next week to debate global 
strategies for stabilizing world population. 
</P>
<P>
 Incensed by the inclusion of abortion and contraception on the agenda, Pope 
John Paul II has mounted one of the Vatican's most intensive diplomatic 
offensives in recent memory to bend an international program into conformity 
with Catholic teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot accept the systematic death of the unborn," John Paul said earlier 
this year. "Every family must know how to resist the false sirens of the 
culture of death." He condemned contraception as "an assault on the sacredness 
of life" and "contrary to moral law." 
</P>
<P>
 Equally adamant, United Nations officials and the Clinton Administration, as 
well as Catholic dissidents and leaders of other faiths, are no less certain of 
their own moral grounding. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Vatican is not the only one" to approach the issue of birth control with 
a moral vision, Fred Sai, chairman of the Cairo conference's preparatory 
committee, declared recently to loud applause at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 How does the Vatican maintain the moral high ground of defending the sanctity 
of human life and the "dignity of the family" when the consequences of its 
opposition to contraception and legal abortion seem to many scientists, 
demographers and policy-makers to be self-defeating? 
</P>
<P>
 The world's population, now numbering 5.6 billion, has doubled since 
mid-century. It is growing at a rate of about 90 million a year -- roughly 
equal to the population of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is a U.N.-sponsored 20-year program to stabilize world population at 
7.27 billion by the year 2050. Unless the brakes are applied, world population 
could reach 8.9 billion by 2030, leveling off at 11.5 billion about 2150, 
according to a United Nations population projection. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is not binding, the Cairo plan would serve as an internationally 
recognized model as nations fashion their own population policies. 
</P>
<P>
 It contains a number of proposals backed by the Vatican, including education 
for girls and primary health care for women and infants. A lower birth rate, 
for example, has been linked to improved literacy and a reduction in infant 
mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 But references to making legal abortions and contraceptives accessible to 
those who want them have infuriated the Vatican. The Pope has used nearly every 
public appearance to denounce the meeting and spoke out again Sunday from his 
country retreat southeast of Rome, saying conference documents do "not 
sufficiently value the social implications that are of the foundation of 
marriage and family." 
</P>
<P>
 Papal representatives are describing the stakes in apocalyptic terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lack of a coherent ethical vision underpinning a document which deals 
with fundamental questions concerning the future of humanity is extremely 
worrying," Msgr. Diarmuid Martin told a preparatory committee meeting April 4 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican's position is bound to have an impact on many of its 1 billion 
adherents worldwide, but it varies from country to country. A majority of 
Catholics in industrialized nations long ago rejected the teaching against 
contraception. It is in developing countries where the church's influence on 
sexual practices is greatest. Papal envoys are attempting to enlist both Roman 
Catholic and Islamic countries in their crusade. 
</P>
<P>
 But with one week remaining before the Sept. 5 opening of the International 
Conference on Population and Development, the Vatican is having difficulty 
laying exclusive claim to the moral high ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Calling those with whom they disagree spiritually false, politically 
imperialist, morally and ethically deficient is as intolerant as it is 
self-righteously arrogant," Rabbi Balfour Brickner, a co-founder of the World 
Conference on Religion and Peace, told reporters earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3,200 U.S. Catholics and 55 organizations have signed a full-page 
newspaper advertisement to be published in the New York Times challenging the 
Vatican's stance against contraception. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brussels, 24 religious thinkers from a dozen variants of major world 
religions convened at the behest of the Ford Foundation and the Pew Global 
Stewardship Initiative to fashion a religious response to the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't dare let the Pope . . . pull off the notion that one side of this is 
moral because it opposes contraception and the other side is immoral and less 
religious," said Martin E. Marty, a noted religion scholar from the University 
of Chicago who chaired the Brussels meeting in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, like the Rev. Gordon L. Sommers, president of the National Council of 
Churches, questioned the morality of denying contraceptives to poor women when 
there are 25 million unsafe and illegal abortions each year. Others speak of 
the biblical imperative of stewardship of God's creation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the Vatican's opposition to contraception and abortion is the 
belief that every person, as a creation of God, has a dignity and worth that is 
unconditional and inalienable. 
</P>
<P>
 The belief is based on the church's interpretation of Jewish and Christian 
Scriptures and what the church calls natural law -- knowledge of God's purpose 
and will through inferences from the visible, natural world. 
</P>
<P>
 As the church applies the teaching, abortion, sterilization and contraception 
are "contrary to the moral law inscribed in the human heart (and) an assault on 
the sacredness of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Natural birth control methods, including the rhythm and ovulation methods -- 
abstaining from sexual intercourse during the wife's fertile days -- are 
permitted by the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church doesn't say people have to propagate and have as many children as 
biologically possible," said the Most Rev. James T. McHugh, a member of the 
Vatican delegation to the Cairo conference and bishop of Camden, N.J. "We 
embrace an ethic of responsible parenthood." 
</P>
<P>
 Natural birth control methods vary from 53% to 86% effective, according to a 
report last year by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. By contrast, the 
pill has been found to prevent pregnancy from 97% to 99% of the time. Male 
condoms are about 85% effective. 
</P>
<P>
 What then of predictions by demographers, scientists and policy-makers of a 
future population-food crisis? "I'm not a Malthusian. I'm a mathematician. You 
simply cannot have all the births that people will bring forth if they use no 
method or natural birth control methods," Marty said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican's response was framed in 1965 when Pope Paul VI addressed the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must strive to multiply bread so that it suffices for the tables of 
mankind," Pope Paul VI told the U.N. General Assembly in 1965, "and not rather 
favor an artificial control of birth . . . in order to diminish the number of 
guests at the banquet of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some experts believe that, if anything, the banquet could become a fast as 
the world's population increases. The expansion of cropland has slowed and much 
agricultural land is losing fertility, according to the Worldwatch Institute, a 
Washington-based research group. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's fish catch peaked in 1989. Grain production, the institute said, 
continues to increase at about 1% a year, but population is growing at closer 
to 2% a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each year the per-capita grain supply is diminishing. That's what's new. I 
think we've moved into a new era," said Worldwatch project director Lester R. 
Brown. "I don't think most people realize it yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Scarcity will fall most heavily on those already poor, 800 million of whom are 
malnourished today, according to the United Nations. So long as couples in the 
poverty-ridden Third World fear hunger and infant mortality, family planning 
makes little sense. They need surviving children, especially sons, to assure 
their old-age security. 
</P>
<P>
 The disparity between the haves and have-nots, some believe, will spur further 
emigration and competition for resources -- and threaten social and political 
upheaval -- in hard-pressed regions. 
</P>
<P>
 Undersecretary of State Timothy Wirth, a member of the U.S. delegation to 
Cairo, told The Times, "Population stabilization is so terribly important for 
global economic development and for the issues of political stability and 
environmental protection that we have got to address the situation very 
aggressively." 
</P>
<P>
 Warnings of a "population bomb" are dismissed by the Vatican as simplistic 
slogans that fail to recognize that many countries with relatively high birth 
rates have an abundance of uninhabited land and undeveloped resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Where there is poverty and hunger, the Vatican said, it is usually due to poor 
administration, political ineptness and corruption, or the result of war -- not 
a scarcity of resources. Further pressure is placed on world food prices -- and 
the environment -- by high consumption in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not agree that the world is in a state of great crisis because of 
population growth," said Vatican delegation member McHugh. 
</P>
<P>
 That position astounds Brickner, the senior rabbi emeritus at Stephen Wise 
Free Synagogue in New York. "To say that there's no overpopulation is a denial 
of reality that is a kind of blindness to justify their theological posture," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, one of the strongest statements calling for a worldwide program to 
stem population has come from the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report made public in June by an Italian Catholic news agency, the 
academy warned of "unresolvable problems" for future generations. It said that 
to indefinitely sustain a birth rate much higher than two children per couple 
would be "unthinkable." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the academy stopped short of recommending contraception. In keeping 
with the Vatican's stand, it emphasized the need for moderation in consumption 
and sharing of Western technology with developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cairo plan makes the linkage between poverty and hunger and population 
growth unmistakably clear, Undersecretary Wirth said. 
</P>
<P>
 But few believe that there will be a radical restructuring of the world 
economy. Even McHugh noted that a recent U.N. report on progress made since the 
1991 Earth Summit on environment and development in Rio de Janeiro said 
industrialized nations have done little to change consumption patterns or to 
step up technological assistance to developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1960, the richest 20% of the world's people held 70% of global income, 
according to "State of the World: 1994," published by Worldwatch. By 1989, the 
wealthy's share climbed to almost 83%. At the same time, the poorest 20% of the 
world's people saw their share drop to 1.4% from 2.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was first 20 years ago to say if all the grain in the world was equitably 
distributed, there would be no hunger or malnutrition anywhere. But having said 
that I'm not sure in retrospect I said very much," said Brown of Worldwatch. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumption increases with affluence. People switch from eating cereal grains 
to chicken, beef and pork. That places added pressure on grain reserves. 
Producing two pounds of meat takes six pounds of grain. No nation, Brown said, 
has ever voluntarily "moved down the food chain" as affluence increases. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also unlikely, he said, that there will be a repeat of the so-called 
"Green Revolution" of the 1960s and 1970s that saw dramatic increases in crop 
yields through the intensive use of petroleum-based fertilizers and hybrid 
seeds. Nor is there much hope at the moment that genetic engineering mentioned 
by Vatican officials will usher in a new age of agricultural bounty. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if there were a series of breakthroughs, environmentalists and 
demographic experts say that there would remain a pressing need for 
contraception. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can increase efficiency, but you're going to be just racing time if 
population growth rates don't slow down. Technology cannot win that race," said 
Sandra Postel, an adjunct professor of international environmental policy at 
Tufts University in Medford, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the inverse is equally true. Contraception and abortion alone cannot do 
the job, or perhaps even work, without narrowing the yawning chasm that 
separates the haves from the have-nots. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has to be a change of attitude across the board," said Bishop McHugh. 
"We're trying to raise people's sights and attitudes to a higher level of moral 
and ethical decision making rather than just succumb to a technological fix."

<P>
 Lou Carlson puffed to the top of a grass hillock in a new, tombstone-free area 
of Fairhaven Memorial Park in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 With a sweep of his arm, Carlson, a Fairhaven family service counselor, 
proudly enunciated the melodic Persian name of his 3-month-old marketing 
brainstorm: "This is Goo-lis-tahn Jah-veed." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Baha'i community, Gulistan-i-Javid , or the Eternal Gardens, evokes 
memories of a historic Baha'i cemetery in Tehran dug up last year to make way 
for an Iranian cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fairhaven, it's the latest in mortuary niche marketing: 243 prime burial 
plots pointed feet first toward the Baha'i holy city of Acre in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to do it," said Carlson, who keeps both the Muslim and Baha'i holy 
books in his briefcase. "We figure out our future by taking a look at who's 
living around us. What the death certificates show is the changing community. 
Instead of Smith, Jones and Weber, we have Trinh, Ramirez and Amamat." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, perhaps the best way to see who's living in Southern California is 
to take a look at who's dying. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, Southern California funeral homes and cemeteries could count on 
a steady stream of traditional, mostly white, Protestant funerals to fill their 
bank accounts and burial plots. 
</P>
<P>
 Now many funeral directors are pushing aside the Ethan Allen-style furniture 
to install fire-resistant tile floors to catch ashes from Buddhists' incense 
and ceiling fans to disperse the perfumed haze. Or they are opening sacrosanct 
embalming rooms to relatives for Muslim bathing rites. 
</P>
<P>
 The way they see it, in the '90s it's not enough to christen an area, install 
a religion-specific monument and hope people will pay $995 for a perpetual-care 
burial plot -- then a few thousand more for a service. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral directors are studying up on the rites of Samoans, Syrians and Hindus. 
And where once there was a mortuary hush, they are allowing round-the-clock 
tape-recorded chanting of Buddhist monks. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are courting leaders of immigrant communities. The Douglass Family 
Mortuaries in Paramount became so well known as "the Gypsy mortuary" that it 
has just such a listing in the white pages. 
</P>
<P>
 These specialized pitches are finding takers. Although some customers see the 
services as kitschy versions of homeland customs, most welcome the interest -- 
whatever the motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fairhaven, Carlson extols his funeral home's attention to sacred Baha'i 
burial rituals in 18-minute infomercials and tries to attract Muslims with 
full-page ads in Persian in the Iranian Yellow Pages. 
</P>
<P>
 His 83-year-old cemetery's next development will include high-tech, 
sensor-activated graveside incinerators so Buddhist mourners can burn paper 
"Hades" money and models of homes that are supposed to ease a loved one's 
journey in the next life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any smart businessman considers the business aspects of meeting with the 
leaders of some of these groups. 'Here I am. Here's what I can offer. How do 
you folks like things done?' " said Michael Kubasak, a spokesman for the 
National Funeral Directors Assn. and president of a Burbank funeral home. 
</P>
<P>
 Other directors are more blunt. The burial business is big business, at $8 
billion a year. What the industry is looking for are people still willing to 
spend the money to be buried. And if a little cultural awareness helps bring 
them in, so be it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You take the stats for white Europeans. A large percentage, huge, are getting 
cremated," said Chick Hinckle, president of Angel's Lawn Cemetery and Funeral 
Home in Anaheim. In California, 43% of the 218,000 people who died in 1993 were 
cremated, more than twice the national average, according to the California 
Funeral Directors Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Many families opt to rent, rather than buy, caskets for viewing or purchase 
$75 cardboard cremation caskets, then sprinkle their loved one's remains at 
sea. Funeral directors, Hinckle said, "are going to go where they can get the 
dollar." 
</P>
<P>
 Hinckle and others link the trend to the dwindling numbers of Anglo worshipers 
in local churches. The traditional, religious burial ceremonies are no longer 
relevant to non-churchgoers. And the standard sales pitch -- that an expensive 
casket equals respect for the dead -- is finding fewer buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's smart mortuaries are hiring Latino funeral directors to accommodate 
Roman Catholic Latino families who still prefer traditional funerals, experts 
say, or are catering to Asian families that generally will buy the most 
expensive caskets, although most plan for cremations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't done an Episcopal funeral in an Episcopal church in ages. Direct 
cremation. That's the way they go," Carlson said. "But Asian families, they'll 
select the nicest caskets -- hardwoods, gorgeous cherries with white velvet 
interiors. Those run about $4,200." 
</P>
<P>
 Which all means taking the long view. Last rites are one of the last holdouts 
against assimilation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Food and burial practices are the strongest indicators of ethnic identity 
I've found," said Karen Leonard, an anthropology professor at UC Irvine who has 
studied the funeral practices of Buddhists, Sikhs and Hindus in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line: Dollars invested in marketing to immigrant groups will pay 
dividends for years. 
</P>
<P>
 On a sweltering August afternoon, about 75 people gathered under a green tent 
at Fairhaven's Baha'i cemetery to send off Khalil Vajdi, patriarch of an Irvine 
family, with prayers chanted in Arabic. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the ceremony, Carlson solemnly greeted mourners by saying, "Alla'u'abha 
, " the Baha'i greeting meaning "God is most great." Many of the Baha'is at the 
funeral, among an estimated 10,000 in Southern California, knew of Carlson from 
his infomercial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is that marketing or is that cultural sensitivity? I consider it to be both 
and I'm fine with that," said Dan Hicks, a Baha'i from San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 Farshad Jahed, 36, of Irvine said having a separate cemetery is a form of 
segregation, but it also provides a sense of identity. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Eastern countries each religion has their own special cemetery," he said. 
"This cemetery recognizes Baha'i as an independent religion." 
</P>
<P>
 (The Baha'i faith was founded by Baha'u'llah, believed to be a manifestation 
of God, in the Middle East in the 19th Century. It teaches the unity of all 
religions and of mankind.) 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street, in the largest of Fairhaven's five visitation rooms, dozens 
of Tongans gathered to mourn the passing of a relative who was 49 and the 
father of three. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in taovalas, stiff skirts woven of dried tree bark in the South 
Pacific nation, they sang hymn after hymn in Tongan, broken only by the widow's 
anguished wails. The powerful, mournful sound of their voices filled the 
corridors and wafted into the parking lot, where their children laughed and 
played. 
</P>
<P>
 Frances Tuakalau, 26, said her family has come to Fairhaven from as far as 
Pomona and Ontario since her mother was buried there 15 years earlier. Tuakalau 
said family members tried another funeral home, but did not return after 
directors there told mourners to "be quiet, get together, get inside or go home 
already." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was because of our (skin) color," she said. "They more understand 
what our traditions are here." 
</P>
<P>
 Muzammil Siddiqi, religious leader of the Islamic Society of Orange County, 
said it is plain "good business" for mortuaries to cater to the needs of his 
community. A friendly mortuary can guarantee business from Muslims across 
Southern California, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, Angel's Lawn in Anaheim sold part of its 22-acre cemetery to 
the Muslim Mortuary and Cemetery Committee to establish a traditional Islamic 
burial ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, in the midst of the lush grass of the cemetery proper, there's a 
3/4-acre lot bordered by oleanders where about 200 headstones sit on mounds of 
powdery dirt, all angled east toward the Muslim holy city of Mecca in Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel's Lawn, contrary to most cemeteries, allows Muslims to be buried without 
a casket so that no Muslim leaves the world richer or poorer than another. It 
also has opened up its traditionally off-limits embalming rooms -- for an 
additional fee of $310 -- to allow Muslim family members to wash and enshroud 
the dead before burial. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Muslim law, no equipment is allowed to run over the graves and the 
deceased are laid to rest next to the last Muslim buried there. But as in life, 
Sunni and Shiite Muslims keep their distance. The Shiites have a separate 
burial ground a few dozen yards away. 
</P>
<P>
 The funeral industry's new marketing is putting the squeeze on 
long-established immigrant funeral homes, such as the 70-year-old Fukui 
Mortuary in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Clients of Japanese ancestry from Fresno to San Diego still travel to Fukui. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the third- or fourth- generation Japanese living in areas that are 
not Japanese, when someone dies they come back to the Japanese community," said 
counseling manager Nobuo Osumi. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said things are changing. 
</P>
<P>
 More are finding their needs met almost as well by non-Japanese mortuaries 
such as Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, which features a Cherry Blossom 
Lawn, complete with Japanese lanterns and a meditation house, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2,600-acre Rose Hills, which bills itself as the world's largest cemetery, 
a daily computerized list of 30 or so services resembles a United Nations of 
names and funeral preferences. 
</P>
<P>
 Among items in the gift shop are bright red portable incinerators for 
graveside rituals -- purchased on the cheap in Los Angeles' Chinatown and sold 
to Buddhist customers for $34. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent day, plumes of smoke feathered skyward from a steep, green 
hillside called the "Garden of Serenity." Each curl of smoke marked the 
mourning ceremony of a Buddhist family. 
</P>
<P>
 On one wind-swept corner, four members of a Chinese family stacked fat oranges 
and flowers beside a grave. Then, while the young son stoked the flames, mother 
and daughter dropped crumpled handfuls of fake money, good luck symbols and 
paper clothing into a rusty half of a metal drum, easing the family matriarch's 
way in the next world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big mortuary companies are catering to other ethnic groups to try and get 
more business," Osumi said. "I think it's OK. We learn from competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, the Peek Family Funeral Home in Westminster took a look at its 
newest neighbors and built a chapel for its Southeast Asian Buddhist clients. 
It included fans to draw off the thick smoke of burning incense, tables for 
temporary shrines and a kitchen for preparing food for funeral guests. 
</P>
<P>
 The new approach paid off. Last year, 40% of its 450 funeral services were 
Vietnamese, Cambodian and Laotian Buddhist, said Terry Stark, a Peek funeral 
director. At an average of $7,000 each, including cemetery space, the services 
brought in more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two years, the home has hired three Vietnamese funeral directors. 
This year, Peek built a new crematory next to the chapel, with a viewing room 
so family members and friends could watch the body enter the furnace. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may have 50, 60, 70 people present to watch the body go in," Stark said. 
"The Vietnamese really insist on this." 
</P>
<P>
 But Stark said the funeral home, associated with Westminster Memorial Park and 
Mortuary, also had another reason for building the chapel. "We lost a lot of 
business because of the incense and the chanting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Cypress College, one of only three places on the West Coast that 
trains morticians, enrolled the first Vietnamese student in its mortuary 
science program. 
</P>
<P>
 Qui Ngo, a 56-year-old former Saigon surgeon living in Orange, said he vaulted 
a huge cultural hurdle just by signing up. In Vietnam, pallbearers are all 
professionals, and the job of handling the dead is taken only by those of the 
lowest class. The rituals are performed by monks or the deceased's eldest son. 
</P>
<P>
 American-style funeral homes are "quite new to them," said Ngo, who arrived in 
the United States in 1992. "There's a real need. They have some difficulty in 
communicating their traditions to (morticians) here." 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, nearly half of the United States' morticians were white men, 
and 36% were white women. By the year 2000, 42% will be white women, 22% will 
be immigrants and 21% will be minorities. Just 17% will be white men, according 
to funeral industry projections. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the 80 students in the two-year Cypress program are women and 
minorities. Program director Doug Metz said the school struggles to keep 
current with new -- at least to local morticians -- customs. The 1994 funeral 
rites and customs textbook already is outdated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were to go to a predominantly black community, I'd know what to expect," 
said Stephanie Goodwin, 42, a former financial controller who graduated from 
the school this summer. "But with Southern California there is no 
'predominantly' anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Some funeral homes, such as Allen-Salas Funeral Service in Bell Gardens, find 
themselves specializing almost by accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the sprawling Gypsy community, not welcome at many mortuaries, gave 
their blessing, along with future business, to funeral director Alfred Estrada 
after he satisfied the boisterous demands of one of their funerals. Now, 
Gypsies knock on his back door in the night when someone dies. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know where I live and they like to have the viewing right away," Estrada 
said. "We are the ones that put up with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Gypsy mourners typically stream in from across Southern California, lugging 
enormous barbecues and mountains of food and drink. "We have a big parking lot 
here. They have a big feast throughout the night and then, the following 
morning, the person is buried," said Estrada, one of Allen-Salas' managing 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
 During the night, the chapel doors are thrown open to the parking lot so 
mourners can bring the deceased steaming plates of food and place items in the 
casket. "If the person smoked, they light a cigarette for them. They put in 
lipstick, telephones, Listerine, toothbrushes," Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other funeral directors, Estrada said accommodating the needs of a 
changing clientele is the only way traditional funeral homes will thrive. 
</P>
<P>
 And that means being prepared to stow a body away if a Buddhist 
monk-astrologer determines that the scheduled service date or time is 
inauspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 Peek's Stark swallowed his surprise at his first Samoan funeral last year when 
each guest took a smiling snapshot with the deceased. "They told me they think 
the ghost of the deceased will come back and they want to prove they were at 
the funeral," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yen Do, editor of the Nguoi Viet Daily News in Westminster, said Vietnamese 
services, usually reflecting social status as much as religious beliefs, are 
taking on elements of modern-day America. Before, mourners would buy elaborate, 
six-foot-tall paper models of homes to burn at the grave site for the deceased 
to use in the next life. 
</P>
<P>
 Not anymore, Do said. "Now, social status at the funeral is providing a 
two-hour video of the service."

 With little public debate, the Federal Reserve Board is increasingly basing 
interest rate decisions on the controversial assumption that the nation's 
unemployment rate cannot be reduced much below 6% without igniting inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 At an annual Federal Reserve conference on economic and labor policy held this 
weekend in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Fed officials privately acknowledged that they 
have come to rely on the 6% jobless figure as a key benchmark for setting 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's central bank already has raised interest rates five times this 
year in an effort to curb the threat of rising prices that often accompany 
rapid economic growth. While Fed officials concede there has been little 
evidence so far of surging prices, they argue that the relatively fast pace of 
growth this year would ultimately fuel inflation if they failed to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 In public and private alike, Fed officials insist that their long-term goal is 
not to force the country into a recession for the sake of low inflation but to 
keep the economy on an even keel, growing at a rate that can be sustained 
without rapid price increases. Their efforts to reduce inflation have been 
widely misunderstood, they complain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monetary policy actions geared to promoting price stability will enhance real 
growth over time," argued Jerry Jordan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Cleveland and one of the participants in the weekend conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet increasingly, Fed officials tend to gauge whether the economy is 
overheating partly by referring to what they call the "natural rate of 
unemployment." That is defined by economists as the lowest level of 
unemployment that can be sustained without putting inflationary pressures on 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, economists used a benchmark called "full employment," and it was 
generally agreed to mean an unemployment rate of about 4%. But today, Fed 
officials and many economists believe that the economy cannot long sustain an 
unemployment rate below about 6% without causing wages and prices to spiral 
upward. 
</P>
<P>
 Fed officials here acknowledged there is still considerable debate about the 
precise level of "natural" unemployment. Some conservatives believe that it 
could be as high as 6.5%, while others believe it could be slightly under 6%. 
But there is general agreement inside the central bank that U.S. unemployment, 
which drifted down from 6.9% in mid-1993 to 6% last June, is very close to the 
natural rate. That, in turn, helps explain why the Fed has moved repeatedly in 
recent months to boost interest rates. Fed officials stress that they use many 
other economic barometers as well, but the natural rate of unemployment is 
clearly one of the most controversial at the central bank's disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Fed officials attending the Wyoming conference conceded privately that 
their increasing reliance on the 6% target is politically sensitive because 
there has been almost no debate in Congress or elsewhere about the new 
assumption that reducing unemployment to 4% or so is no longer a realistic 
goal. While some Fed officials, notably Robert Parry, president of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of San Francisco, have given speeches about the importance of the 
natural rate of unemployment, many of their colleagues admit that it is a 
difficult issue to raise with Congress and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The new approach is particularly risky since Congress mandated in the 1970s 
that one of the Fed's priorities had to be achieving "full employment." That 
mandate is contained in the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, which still provides the 
technical guidelines the Fed is supposed to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "The natural-rate hypothesis has received near-universal acceptance among 
academic economists since the 1970s," said Stanford University economist Paul 
Krugman, who attended the weekend session. "My sense is that it is less 
well-accepted among policy-makers and journalists, who seem to regard it as an 
abstract idea whose very neatness makes it suspect. It is therefore worth 
pointing out that for the United States at least, the natural-rate hypothesis 
has a very solid basis in experience." 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend conference brought together virtually every top Fed official as 
well as many senior Clinton Administration policy-makers and leading private 
economists. The discussions focused in part on the reasons for the rise in the 
"natural" unemployment rate during the last two decades in the United States 
and Europe. It also addressed government policies that might be useful in 
reversing the trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Some at the conference -- notably Lawrence Katz, the Labor Department's chief 
economist -- argued that improved job training and school dropout prevention 
programs could help lower the natural rate. But few see a major role for the 
Fed in reducing the rate below its current level. 
</P>
<P>
 Fed Vice Chairman Alan Blinder noted in a speech Saturday that the Fed 
certainly has the ability to stimulate the economy -- and thus reduce 
unemployment -- in the short term by loosening its grip on the money supply. 
But over longer periods of time, he said, it cannot goose the economy and boost 
job creation without causing a sharp rise in inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a keynote speech, Krugman argued that the natural rate of unemployment has 
risen during the last generation in large part because of costly government 
social programs in the United States and Europe that reduce incentives for the 
poor to get off welfare and other assistance and return to the work force. 
</P>
<P>
 That trend, coupled with the increased importance of education in getting a 
good job, has led to a sharp rise in long-term unemployment, especially in 
Europe, Krugman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the natural unemployment rate in Europe is now thought to be about 
twice the U.S. level. The increase in the United States has been less extreme, 
in part because American social programs are less generous, Krugman observed. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is also because there are fewer governmental restrictions on firing or 
laying off workers in the United States, which means American employers are 
less reluctant than their European counterparts to hire new employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Other participants agreed with Krugman's diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suggest that a better name (for the trend) is welfare-state unemployment," 
said Allan Meltzer, a conservative economist at Carnegie Mellon University. 
</P>
<P>
 While the United States has been able to create more jobs than Europe, it has 
paid a price in the form of greater income inequality, the participants agreed. 
Low-paying jobs are more acceptable to American workers than their European 
counterparts because they don't have a generous social safety net to fall back 
upon when they are unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence that the United States has done better on employment growth but 
worse on real wages, overall productivity growth and wage inequality than 
Europe raises the question of whether advanced industrial nations face an 
inevitable trade-off between more jobs and better jobs," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Government training and apprenticeship programs can have an impact, Katz 
noted. But Krugman disagreed, saying he doesn't believe such efforts can 
significantly change the natural rate of unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two main alternatives: Europe can become more like America, or it 
can try to become more like Sweden used to be," said Krugman. "That is, the 
welfare state can be scaled back, increasing the incentives for firms to offer 
and for workers to accept low-wage employment; or governments can try to 
subsidize employment at acceptable wage levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The political problems with either alternative are obvious," he continued. 
"Attempts to scale back the protections that have discouraged employment in 
Europe will, indeed already have, led to massive protests. On the other hand, 
if employment is to be subsidized, the money must be found somewhere. The 
unemployment problem of the advanced nations has no painless solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan argued that such a direct trade-off between a 
society that allows greater poverty in order to generate more jobs and one that 
provides a generous safety net while sacrificing job growth seems to leave 
little room for central bankers to act to reduce unemployment below the natural 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the trade-off is as stark as it appears, those endeavoring to address 
structural employment imbalances are bound to find themselves frustrated," 
Greenspan said in a speech here.

VALLEY LITTLE LEAGUERS GET A HERO'S WELCOME; HOMECOMING: FAMILY, FRIENDS AND 
ONLOOKERS GATHER AT LAX TO OFFER 'EARTHQUAKE KIDS' A ROUSING GREETING.

 One day after the most heartbreaking loss of their short careers, the 14 
members of the Northridge Little League team were wide-eyed with surprise 
Sunday as a cheering throng at Los Angeles International Airport gave them a 
hero's homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's wrenching 4-3 loss to a team from Maracaibo, Venezuela, in the 
final game of the Little League World Series might just as well never have 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are one of the two best teams in the world, and they'll always be No. 1 
to us," said Shelley Piccard, aunt of reserve player Scott (Scooter) Drake. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 giddy family members and fans packing camcorders and cameras 
gathered outside the USAir gate to await the team's afternoon arrival from 
Williamsport, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Many held placards or banners made of bedsheets, proclaiming the team "U.S. 
Little League Champions," a crown they had already garnered before taking the 
field against Venezuela. Others waved "Earthquake Kids" signs, referring to the 
nickname given a team forced to juggle batting practice with house repairs 
after the Northridge quake rolled through in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is life," read one fan's T-shirt. "The rest is just details." 
</P>
<P>
 The excitement in the usually quiet and dimly lit terminal lured others 
leisurely awaiting the arrival of friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's going on?" one boy asked. "Who's here?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Hibsman family of Rancho Palos Verdes was there to greet daughter Tina, 
coming home from medical school on the same flight as the team. Someone thrust 
Little League championship placards in their hands and they began waving them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're caught up in the excitement," said father Ed Hibsman. 
</P>
<P>
 After offloading what a TV cameraman called the "generic" passengers -- during 
which someone in the crowd shouted, "Welcome to Los Angeles, we do this for 
everyone!" -- an airline desk attendant announced the arrival of the Northridge 
team, and a cheer rang out from gates along an entire wing of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The players and coaches, wearing their caps and light-blue and white uniforms, 
exited the plane to face a slew of family members and fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The pre-teen boys of summer hugged and high-fived people they'd never met 
while electronic flashes popped and airport police scurried to keep the surging 
crowd at bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow, this is great," said second baseman Michael Frost, explaining that the 
team hadn't expected such a homecoming after the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best feeling in the world," first baseman Matt Cassel said with a grin, 
as photographers jockeyed for position around him. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassel let out a "whooo!" and began another round of high-fives when it was 
announced that a local radio station had provided stretch limousines -- loaded 
with pizza and private phones -- to whisk them to their Northridge practice 
field and another welcoming party. 
</P>
<P>
 As the boys sped north on the San Diego Freeway in the long white limos, 
gobbling pepperonis and slugging down Coke, their legend was growing among 
their Northridge peers. 
</P>
<P>
 Awaiting the team's arrival at the park, Little League friends and former 
opponents of the champs spat and jawed like old-timers about their own on-field 
encounters with the now-famous 12-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a double off him the only time I ever faced him," Ricky Wendt, 12, 
bragged of his only duel with Northridge pitcher Justin Gentile. 
</P>
<P>
 Said 11-year-old Mike Fegan, "Those guys get picked up in a limo, and they get 
to eat pizza. Everybody knows 'em. They're famous!" 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time the team arrived, the players had pretty much seen and done it 
all -- the Little League World Series, TV appearances, the Pittsburgh airport 
-- and were getting a bit jaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Lounging in the limo with a Coke and a pile of half-eaten pizzas at his feet, 
reserve second baseman John Michael Baca was asked if he remembered that school 
starts next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got no idea," he replied. "Don't care, either." 
</P>
<P>
 The team will be honored with two parades today. The first starts at 
Disneyland at 1:30 p.m. After that, players and coaches will rush back to 
Northridge for a parade at 4:30 p.m. It will begin at Northridge Rec Center, 
run north on Reseda Boulevard and then west on Devonshire Street to the Little 
League fields.

A HOT SPOT FOR VACATIONERS; FOREIGN TRAVELERS FLOCK TO DEATH VALLEY TO 
EXPERIENCE ITS EXTREME TEMPERATURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 A hot wind buffets Peter Schulze and his girlfriend, Ingrid Luedke, as they 
read a digital thermometer. It's 120 degrees at 5:30 in the afternoon, and 
these Germans wonder why they're vacationing in this blistering, blowing 
heating duct known as Death Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was afraid of coming here, because of the heat, and because of the name of 
this place," Luedke said. "This is like standing in a hair dryer. This place is 
very impressive, but it's not very nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to Death Valley in the summertime, an alluring and unparalleled draw 
for thousands of foreigners because of the heat, spectacular barren scenery, 
expansive desolation, striking geology and place names like Furnace Creek, the 
Devil's Golf Course, Badwater, Funeral Peak and Dante's View. 
</P>
<P>
 It might seem an odd summer vacation venue to Californians, what with its 
notoriety as the hottest place on the planet on any given day. But foreigners 
are not so easily scared away. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulze and Luedke were among a dozen international travelers who, with 
cameras, maps and water bottles in hand, mopped their brows last week at a 
viewpoint alongside a brackish pool known as Badwater. 
</P>
<P>
 Two miles out on the valley floor, at a point hard to distinguish through the 
shimmering distortion of the desert air, lies the lowest, driest, hottest scab 
of earth in the Western Hemisphere. It's 282 feet below sea level. Three years 
ago, an Ohio man perished out there, trying to traverse the salt pan without 
carrying enough water. 
</P>
<P>
 But on this afternoon, Frenchman Guy Leprince headed that same direction, 
bare-chested and in jogging shorts. After several hundred yards, he turned 
back, satisfied by his abbreviated hike. His was the kind of bravado that 
causes local rangers to cringe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the heat. I like the desert," he boasted, beads of sweat shimmering on 
his tanned face. 
</P>
<P>
 As inhospitable as this place is, at the most inhospitable time of year, the 
foreign tourists still come. 
</P>
<P>
 The 224-room Furnace Creek Ranch is booked solid in the summer with a steady 
flow of international visitors who want to encounter Death Valley at its 
extreme. Several thousand others pass through daily in August, finding it a 
fascinating and incongruous transition between Yosemite's forest and Las Vegas' 
glitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ask visitors why they want to come to Death Valley in the summer. I think 
they may be psychotic," laughed Martha Watkins, director of the Death Valley 
Chamber of Commerce. "I live here, and if I could, I'd leave here in the 
summer." 
</P>
<P>
 One day this month, temperatures reached 126 degrees at the official reporting 
station here. Back in 1913 it reached 134 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is good to experience the limits," mused Canadian John Stephen, "so you 
can picture the spectrum of the Earth. And this is one of the limits." 
</P>
<P>
 Britain's Colin Carmichael, squinting against the wind, was struck by the 
swatches of pastels inlaid in the naked mountainsides, warming to the sunset. 
"There is no place hotter on the planet today," he said. "And still, this is so 
beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Others marvel at the pinnacled crystalline salt formations that sculpt 200 
square miles of valley floor near Badwater, and the 14 square miles of rippled 
sand dunes that, at dawn, display the tracks of sidewinders and kangaroo rats 
before they are erased by the day's winds. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel agents specializing in foreign business have long understood the magic 
of Death Valley in the summer and include it on their two-week tours of the 
American Southwest that feature the Grand Canyon, Bryce and Zion national 
parks, Las Vegas, Yosemite and the coastline between San Francisco and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 About 120,000 people visited Death Valley National Monument in April, the most 
popular month of the year. Most of them were Americans. This month, nearly 
90,000 people are expected to visit, estimated park Supt. Ed Rothfuss. The vast 
majority are foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most come here in the summer because it is their holiday period back home," 
he said. "Americans have options of when to come -- and a lot would rather come 
in January than the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what's amazing," he said, "is how many foreign visitors come back with 
friends. Europeans hold a fascination with the legends of the Old West, and 
they want to see Death Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Edie Behler, of Go America Tours in Los Angeles, agreed. "They've seen the 
pictures and heard the stories and so they want to see it for themselves," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Do the travelers know what they're getting into, heading into Death Valley 
this time of year? 
</P>
<P>
 "All the travel publications mention the heat -- we say, 'Listen, guys, the 
temperature is 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) and warmer.' But 
it's one thing to read about it, and another thing to experience it," Behler 
said. "At least, this is a much drier heat than they experience in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Mariane DeCupua of Top Tours USA: "Germans have the Alps and they have 
ocean, but they don't have anything like Death Valley. When they get off the 
buses at Furnace Creek, they're laughing and having fun because of the intense 
heat. They love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that's true to a degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Stopping for lunch at the Furnace Creek restaurant, French tour guide Marilyn 
Negrel said her charges were experiencing Death Valley in quick snippets. "We 
arrive at a viewpoint, they jump out of the air-conditioned bus, take a picture 
and get back on the bus. I don't have to tell them to come back in five minutes 
because they come back, quickly, quite naturally." 
</P>
<P>
 Some bus companies have stopped running tours through Death Valley in the 
summer, concerned that the heat will tax not only their passengers but the 
vehicles themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a place you want to go," warned Melody Amatori, whose Express Tours 
in San Francisco avoids Death Valley from June 15 until September, because of 
what happened two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was 130 degrees, I had 48 Germans on the bus, and our fuel pump went out," 
she said. "The bus behind us had to go on to Lone Pine, unload and come back 
for my group. We were out there for three hours and, yes, they were a bit 
unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the few Americans in Death Valley in recent days were engineers and 
drivers for automobile manufacturers, using the steep grades out of the valley 
to test how well their vehicles handle the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, mechanical breakdowns are a nemesis to park rangers, who are spread so 
thin it takes three or four days to patrol all the monument's roadways. 
Motorists are advised to stay only on the well-traveled roads in the summer and 
to flag down a passerby if they are in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Of greater concern is visitors succumbing to heat injuries from overexposure, 
which can sneak up on them, physicians warn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drinking just lots of water isn't necessarily the answer because your body 
continues to lose salt," said Dr. Stuart Porter, an Army physician at Ft. Irwin 
who also works at Southern Inyo Hospital at Lone Pine, just west of Death 
Valley. People unaccustomed to the desert should drink sports beverages that 
replenish the body with sodium and potassium, he advised. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweating is not always a gauge that trouble is near, he said. "In the dry 
heat, your sweat can evaporate so fast you might not even be aware you're 
sweating," he said. "Or, you can already be so dehydrated you no longer sweat." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Death Valley's summertime billing, some Californians still come here 
for fun in the sun. At the Furnace Creek Ranch pool, Frank and Cathy Brum of 
Hercules, Calif., lounged in 95-degree water that was pumped directly from an 
underground river that courses beneath the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love the heat, the solitude -- and, with all the foreign languages we 
hear, it's like being in Europe without paying the air fare," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But mostly, this place is given to foreigners -- including about 15% of the 
resort staff itself. Monika Meixner has left her home in Austria for the past 
three summers to be here, near her fiance -- the summer heat notwithstanding. 
She bides her time selling dates in the resort's front parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I drink water," she said, "and wait for the time to pass. The tourists, they 
just get out of their cars and laugh, like it's a joke. They know they can 
leave right away." 
</P>
<P>
 For some folks, a day or two here is downright therapeutic. Frank Kok, an 
airport manager from the Netherlands, said, "As long as you have enough water 
in your cool box, the desolation of this place is absolutely wonderful and 
calming." 
</P>
<P>
 His companion, Nicolette Waaning, added with a chuckle, "Yes, for a day. Then 
you want to get very, very far away from here." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Hall, who brought his family from England, noted that after washing his 
hands, he could more quickly dry them by stepping outside than by using the air 
blowers in the restroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "How people crossed this valley in stagecoaches -- that is unbelievable, quite 
awe-inspiring, isn't it?" he reflected. 
</P>
<P>
 Swiss traveler Francoise Chatton offered this advice, after hiking through the 
sand dunes: "Walk early in the morning, and sleep during the day." 
</P>
<P>
 Christa Walden left Italy to tag along with her brother and his family on 
their vacation, and argued unsuccessfully against visiting Death Valley. "I 
like green forests and water," she said. "But now I am putting aside my 
cynicism. I didn't expect these colors, these shapes, even the hot wind. And 
now I understand why we came." 
</P>
<P>
 Austrian Peter Rothenender, taking in a panoramic view of the valley, put it 
differently: "This place is the coolest place on Earth."

HOLDUP VICTIM SHOT, SURVIVES 15 HOURS IN GRAVE-LIKE HOLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 62-year-old Riverside County man who was shot by a robber and then concealed 
in a 4 1/2-foot-deep grave-like hole for 15 hours over the weekend was resting 
at home Sunday, the Riverside County Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Logan, who was rescued by a jogger Saturday, was treated at Riverside 
Community Hospital for a "through-and-through" gunshot wound and released, 
investigator Mark Lohman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman -- described as in his 30s and wearing military gear from "head to 
toe," a ski mask and gloves, was still on the loose, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Logan had returned to his Indian Hills home west of Riverside Friday afternoon 
to find one of his pit bulls shot and a man pointing a gun at him, authorities 
said. The gunman forced Logan inside the house, tied his hands, gagged him, 
took an undisclosed amount of cash and shot him in the back, the investigator 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber took Logan to the semirural Canyon Crest area and threw him into a 
4 1/2-foot-deep rectangular hole, then covered it with plywood, Lohman said. 
"It looked like if you were in a cemetery, standing over a grave," the 
investigator said. 
</P>
<P>
 Logan managed to breathe in the hole by standing and pushing the plywood to 
let in some air. He also struggled inside the hole to remove his gag and called 
for help when he heard a passing jogger.

 In the political jungle of Sacramento, some state lawmakers duck for cover

 During a decade in the Assembly, the Republican from Newport Beach has 
consistently performed in the same gung-ho, damn-the-odds manner he employed as 
a combat-tested Marine. 
</P>
<P>
 Be it taking on archfoe Tom Hayden or pushing a resolution justifying the 
internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, Ferguson has demonstrated 
a ready zeal to wave the conservative flag and charge uphill against the 
Democrat enemy -- sometimes with only a few GOP foot soldiers behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 But now such battles beneath the Capitol dome could be coming to an end. 
Ferguson, 71, is retiring from the Assembly this month, and although he is 
plotting a run next year for the state Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Marian 
Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), he'll likely face tough competition from two 
Republican colleagues. As the Legislature winds down to its close Wednesday, 
these could be Ferguson's final days. 
</P>
<P>
 His departure would leave Sacramento bereft of one of its most loquacious and 
colorful orators, a veritable foghorn for the ideological right. 
Ultra-opinionated, forthright almost to a fault, Ferguson has been drubbed by a 
legion of critics who have called him a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, 
anti-environment and anti-government. 
</P>
<P>
 Love him or loathe him, Gil Ferguson is no standard-issue lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gil says what he thinks," Assemblyman Bill Jones (R-Fresno) said. "I don't 
agree with him all the time, but you always know where he stands." 
</P>
<P>
 Even die-hard liberal opponents concede a grudging respect for a man they 
consider one of the Capitol's true characters. "Fergie is Fergie," said 
Assemblyman John Burton, a Democrat from San Francisco, which Ferguson calls 
"Sodom and Gomorrah" during floor debates. "He's got his own point of view and 
he has fun sometimes with his hyperbole. . . . It's too late in life to change 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson has managed to push his share of bills through the 
Democrat-controlled Legislature, but he will be best remembered for staking out 
controversial positions that rank-led liberals and for going down to a series 
of flaming defeats. 
</P>
<P>
 There was his proposal to castrate repeat rapists, which never got out of 
committee. His effort to block free condom distribution to teen-agers angered 
AIDS activists, who dumped 140 pounds of steer manure at his district office's 
front door. Ferguson has irked 1st Amendment buffs by attempting to ban the 
sale of sexually explicit tabloids from sidewalk news racks. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some of his biggest failures have proved prophetic. Ferguson takes credit 
for proposing the state's first term-limits law. It lasted, he recalls, just 35 
seconds in its first committee hearing before lawmakers voted it down. But the 
idea was picked up for a state ballot measure and became law in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a basic floor he lives on, things he absolutely believes in, and he 
stands by them," observed Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange), Ferguson's 
closest ally. "There are very few people around here who are willing to stand 
up and voice their principles the way Gil Ferguson has at the risk of being 
called racist and anti-this or anti-that." 
</P>
<P>
 But some fellow Orange County Republicans act as though they'll be glad to see 
Ferguson go. Although he was once part of the inner circle of conservatives 
known during the 1980s as the "cavemen," Ferguson is on the outs these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of his erstwhile allies declined to talk publicly, but some privately 
confessed that they have grown to consider Ferguson a bit of a blowhard, 
braggart and back-room bully -- a nuisance who rubs cohorts the wrong way 
during leadership battles and the election season. 
</P>
<P>
 With characteristic bluster, Ferguson consigns the infighting to the ash heap 
of political history. He came to Sacramento as an iconoclast, and that's the 
way he'll go out. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got an agenda, and I don't fit that agenda," Ferguson said. "A lot of 
their waking time is spent strategizing about power, how to gain more power. My 
time is spent with the issues of the day and trying to do what we can to move 
things back toward ideological Republicanism." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson arrived in the state Capitol toting a resume filled with 
achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Marine, he served in three wars, was wounded three times and became a 
much-decorated combat officer, mustering out as a lieutenant colonel after a 
quarter-century career. He moved on to private enterprise, first as an 
executive with the Irvine Co., then running a firm with his wife, Anita, that 
developed luxury homes. The building company was a success, then faltered 
during the real estate slowdown, but has since recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning an underdog victory in 1984, Ferguson didn't take long to make 
his mark in the Assembly. In one memorable address his first year, he tearfully 
blasted Hayden -- the Vietnam-era anti-war protester who represents Santa 
Monica -- as a traitor. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the beginning of what would become a cause for Ferguson. Egged on by 
veterans' groups, he pushed the Legislature to dump Hayden from office. Like 
many of his quixotic quests, the anti-Hayden campaign proved unsuccessful. But 
it reaped Ferguson other rewards: a mother lode of campaign cash and nationwide 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Capitol colleagues also paid heed. A legislative Rambo wielding a microphone 
like an M-16 automatic, Ferguson earned the nickname "Gilbo" for his deadly 
rhetoric. "Even that nickname didn't do him justice," recalled Assemblyman Stan 
Statham (R-Oak Run), a Ferguson admirer. "When he first arrived, Gil didn't hit 
town -- he attacked it. " 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden wasn't the only politician to get caught in Ferguson's line of fire. In 
1992, he sponsored an unsuccessful bill to put state lawmakers in the top tax 
bracket, reasoning that legislators should endure the burden of a new tax 
bracket they had imposed on the wealthiest Californians. More recently, he 
championed legislation that would have required lawmakers to resign from one 
political office before running for another. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I found when I arrived was men and women who had been here for decades," 
Ferguson said. "They were more interested in their power than they were the 
people's business. After 20 years, some of them 30 years, they think this 
building is theirs and they think this government is theirs." 
</P>
<P>
 A prolific letter writer, Ferguson also has become well-known for his poison 
pen, dashing off caustic missives to the high and mighty across the land. In 
1990, he bashed George Bush for breaking a vow not to raise taxes. Other 
letters have unloaded on the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, 
Republican Party leaders and Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
 Equivocation isn't in Ferguson's dictionary, and sometimes it causes trouble. 
He once wrote a letter to a San Diego newspaper blasting then-Assemblyman Steve 
Peace (D-Chula Vista) for opposing a Ferguson bill. Peace confronted him in a 
Capitol hallway, and the pair had a shouting match that remains legendary in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 In another episode in 1990, Ferguson called a group of gay rights activists 
"faggots" after they picketed a speech he was delivering. He later said he did 
not realize the word was derogatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden, the assemblyman's chief target, said Ferguson has been ineffective as 
a legislator. "He's attacked civil rights, affirmative action, gay rights, 
Hayden, environmentalists, and it must be frustrating for him, because as far 
as I can see, he hasn't gotten anywhere," Hayden said. "He's just kind of made 
his point." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Ferguson will always see himself as on the ramparts, leading the 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Roman legions, they had men in each company who carried the standard," 
he said. "He'd rush among the enemy to plant it in the ground. All the other 
men would fight toward the standard to rescue him. That was his job. I view 
that as my job."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: WILSON SEEKS LIFT FROM WAVE OF BOAT PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a campaign scrapper, Gov. Pete Wilson has few equals. He's swift on his 
feet and quickly spots openings -- even one provided 2,500 miles away by a 
grumpy old Communist dictator. 
</P>
<P>
 Those thousands of Cuban refugees turned loose into the Florida Straits have 
become Fidel Castro's gift to the Republican governor of California. Wilson 
unwrapped the present after Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles pleaded for help to his 
fellow Democrat in the White House and President Clinton responded with a 
massive effort of military interdiction, rescue and detention. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, what's this? Wilson cried in indignation. Why Florida and not California? 
 
</P>
<P>
 Why isn't it a national emergency when 2,400 foreigners, on average, illegally 
enter California each week? Why isn't Clinton protecting this border? What's 
different about Florida? 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson told me he suspects three things: Castro and the daring refugees are 
hot news that pressures the President, while California's story is old; Clinton 
wants to help Chiles win reelection; Atty. Gen. Janet Reno herself is from 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a fourth factor Wilson didn't mention: It's one thing to confront 
nemesis Castro, another to alienate friendly Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter. The campaigning governor really was accentuating a larger point 
to voters: He's the California candidate who has been pushing hardest against 
illegal immigration, an issue many believe rescued his political career. 
</P>
<P>
 And by capitalizing on the Castro-Clinton row with a major news conference in 
San Diego and a full-page ad in the New York Times, Wilson also set the stage 
for his endorsement of Proposition 187, probably this fall's most controversial 
ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There has been recent speculation that Wilson may be backing away from the 
initiative its supporters call SOS (Save Our State), perhaps even preparing to 
oppose it. Forget that. The governor says Proposition 187 is a way to "force 
the issue" of illegal immigration into the courts and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 He also clearly expects it to be popular and turn out conservatives for him on 
Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court in 1982 ruled that states must educate illegal 
immigrants. It's costing California $1.2 billion annually. Proposition 187 
forbids this public schooling, a provision that likely would be struck down by 
some federal judge. But Wilson and the measure's sponsors hope the Supreme 
Court will reconsider the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically what SOS will do is create lawsuits, which I think will be a very 
useful thing," Wilson says. 
</P>
<P>
 Counters an initiative opponent, Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), who is 
running for insurance commissioner: "Why waste all the campaign money? Why not 
just go to the court directly? This is more a Republican get-out-the-vote 
strategy than solving a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 has other contentious features. It would deny non-emergency 
public health care and social services to illegal immigrants. And it has a 
snitch clause requiring school, health and law officials to report suspected 
illegal immigrants to the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be more suspect than anyone," says Assemblyman Richard Polanco 
(D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Legislative Latino Caucus. "The browner the 
skin, the (more) different the accent, the more suspect. That's discriminatory. 
I've seen the movies, read the books. Back then (under Nazis), there were stars 
(that Jews were required to wear)." 
</P>
<P>
 The governor says he understands why the snitch clause "bothers people," but 
notes teachers must report "suspected child abusers." He adds, "when you go 
into the booth, you either vote 'yes' or 'no.' You don't vote 'maybe.' And I've 
never seen an initiative free of some imperfection (nor) many statutes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is one place where the gubernatorial candidates sharply differ. And if 
Wilson can finesse it, 187 will become a wedge issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasurer Kathleen Brown hopes the measure will turn out Latinos and liberals 
opposed to it and that by strongly opposing the proposition, she will be more 
warmly embraced by these Democratic core groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me be clear -- illegal immigration is a very real problem," Brown says. 
"But Proposition 187 is flawed. It would throw kids out of school, leading to 
more gangs and drugs. It would deny health care, inviting the spread of deadly 
diseases. And it would require Californians to turn in other Californians who 
might be 'suspect.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Asserts Proposition 187 campaign manager Bob Kiley: "Our polling shows people 
don't care what the opposition says. This whole thing's about sending a message 
to Sacramento and to Washington. And it's going to land on Clinton's desk." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Wilson is sending his own message -- with the help of an aging 
dictator.

TECHNOLOGY TO BRING LEGISLATIVE PROCESS TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS; EDUCATION: 
VIDEOTAPES FROM THE CAPITOL AND ELECTRONIC TOWN HALL MEETINGS WILL GIVE YOUTHS 
A CHANCE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT STATE GOVERNMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY GILLAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Using videotapes and interactive town hall meetings, the Legislature plans to 
begin bringing state government closer to high school students through an 
innovative statewide teaching project called "LegiSchool." 
</P>
<P>
 The project, which will be operated in partnership with Cal State Sacramento, 
will use videotapes of legislative floor sessions and live town hall meetings 
broadcast from the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea behind LegiSchool is to encourage students to engage in dialogue and 
debate on real problems affecting Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project will provide students with a firsthand activist approach toward 
examining key legislative issues that affect their lives," said Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). "It will establish an engaging window 
on state legislative affairs for high school students." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how LegiSchool will work: 
</P>
<P>
 Gavel-to-gavel tapes of Assembly and Senate floor sessions and committee 
hearings will be sent to the university for editing into hourlong videotapes on 
key issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The university will produce a written curriculum to go along with the 
videotapes, which will be deposited in the university library. Supplemental 
materials could include the text of a bill, its voting history, committee 
analyses, press releases and related newspaper articles. 
</P>
<P>
 Other specialized videotapes will include how a bill becomes a law, tracing 
the route that legislation takes in the Assembly and Senate to eventually land 
on the governor's desk for his signature into law or veto. 
</P>
<P>
 Still more tapes will feature the governor's annual state-of-the-state speech 
in which he outlines what he wants from the Legislature, plus an average day in 
the life of a state lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 As for what kind of subjects might be covered on the videotapes, Tim Hodson, 
executive director of the university's Center for California Studies, said 
issues such as AIDS education, guns on campuses, paddling as a punishment for 
graffiti crimes, and requiring school uniforms to be worn on campus might also 
be topics for videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Both public and private schoolteachers can then request tapes on a given 
subject for a nominal fee of about $10. 
</P>
<P>
 "The LegiSchool project is the result of a three-year effort to create a 
cost-effective, educator-oriented plan that would use Assembly television video 
to increase students' knowledge of state government," Hodson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The town hall meetings will be held monthly and broadcast live from the state 
Capitol with participating schools using telephone and television lines, 
enabling students to ask questions of both state legislators and officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature has held several interactive committee hearings this year, in 
which viewers of the California Channel throughout the state were able to 
communicate via an 800 number or by computer to ask questions and participate 
in discussions with lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown first brought up the subject of a possible LegiSchool project with state 
university officials. CSUS was selected to participate because of its close 
proximity to the Capitol and its existing state government student-intern 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected to begin in November, production costs will be paid by nonprofit 
foundation funds plus tape rental fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "This can be a real learning tool," said Assemblyman Stan Statham (R-Oak Run), 
a former television anchorman and chairman of the Committee on Televising the 
Assembly. "To most students, a videotape is more interesting than a textbook. 
With this project, they're going to get both."

MEXICO IS WINDING UP ITS FIRST VOTE WITHOUT HORSE-TRADING; ELECTIONS: A CENTRAL 
COMPUTER IS KEEPING PRECINCT-BY-PRECINCT TALLY, NEGATING THE TRADITIONAL 
BACK-ROOM DEALINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Sunday after elections traditionally has been the day that the doors to 
smoke-filled back rooms opened and representatives of the ruling party and 
opposition emerged with the vote tallies, the product of intense negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 This Sunday, however, Mexicans expected to hear the final tally of a vote 
count that has been added up publicly throughout the week as returns rolled in 
-- a tally that can be checked precinct by precinct on a central computer, to 
assure that the results reported are the same as those counted at each polling 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 They already know that 42-year-old economist Ernesto Zedillo has won the 
presidency for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), but by the 
smallest margin in the party's 65-year history: 48.77% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than waiting for the outcome of private talks, for the past week 
Mexicans have watched the quite-public marathon session of the Federal 
Electoral Board discussing whether the proper procedures had been followed in 
specific polling places and which violations were severe enough to nullify a 
precinct's votes. The complaints of irregularities by the conservative National 
Action Party (PAN) -- all 13,108 of them -- have been debated in front of the 
entire nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Those talks are not expected to substantially alter the election results that 
left second-place Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the PAN with 25.94% of the 
vote and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party 
(PRD) in third with 16.6%. The rest of the ballots were either cast for six 
minor parties or spoiled. 
</P>
<P>
 If the 2.82% of spoiled ballots -- usually a form of voter protest -- are not 
counted, Zedillo would receive a slim majority of 50.18% to 26.69% for 
Fernandez and 17.08% for Cardenas. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the wide margins between the candidates mean the debate will not 
change the election's outcome, analysts said the public sessions are important 
because they are establishing an important precedent of legality and 
transparency. 
</P>
<P>
 "The winners and losers are being determined by means of the election," said 
Jose Woldenberg, one of the six citizen-members who hold the majority of the 
electoral board's seats. The board is the governing body of the Federal 
Electoral Institute, a quasi-independent agency that runs elections. "In other 
countries, that would seem obvious, but based on the tradition we come from, it 
is very relevant." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican tradition is to make a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in 1976, Alejandro Gascon, candidate of the Stalinist Popular 
Socialist Party (PPS) and mayor of the Nayarit state capital of Tepic, won the 
majority of votes for the governorship of that Pacific Coast state. 
</P>
<P>
 Party Chairman Jorge Cruickshank was summoned to the campaign headquarters of 
the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 "I caught them," recalled former Excelsior reporter Carlos Ferreira, who saw 
Cruickshank talking animatedly with Porfirio Munoz Ledo, then a PRI official 
and now chairman of the PRD. They emerged after several hours, with Cruickshank 
conceding Gascon's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later, the PRI allied itself with the PPS behind Cruickshank's 
Senate bid in Oaxaca state, making him the first opposition senator in modern 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 The tradition of negotiating votes has intensified during the six years that 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari has been president. During his term, opposition 
militants have taken to the streets to protest election fraud while their 
leaders cut back-room deals for interim governorships or city halls. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw this in Guanajuato, San Luis Potosi and Yucatan," said Santiago Creel, 
another citizen board member. Fraud-ridden gubernatorial elections in San Luis 
Potosi and Guanajuato led to such drastic protests that the states became 
ungovernable, forcing Salinas to appoint compromise interim governors. 
</P>
<P>
 When a similar situation developed in Yucatan, local PRI leaders refused to 
accept defeat, forcing national party leaders to instead offer the opposition 
the mayor's seat in the capital of Merida. 
</P>
<P>
 The PAN has become especially adept at such negotiations, to the point that 
many PRD activists believe that their party has been damaged by Cardenas' 
refusal to cut deals. But Cardenas may prove to have been ahead of the national 
electoral trend. 
</P>
<P>
 From taxi drivers to intellectuals, Mexicans are becoming increasingly 
indignant about elections that are decided after the voting rather than by the 
voting.  
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, since the PPS negotiated away its victory in Nayarit, voters have 
become disenchanted with the radical leftist party. Last week, it received less 
than 1.5% of the vote, the minimum needed to maintain a federal registry as a 
legally recognized party. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a serious inertia, a culture of resolving problems through 
negotiation instead of institutionally," Creel said. "This has to change. We 
cannot continue deciding electoral issues in the street and over the bargaining 
table." 
</P>
<P>
 In this election, the real test of the nation's commitment to making electoral 
decisions in the voting booth may be the fight over the mayorship of the 
industrial city of Monterrey. 
</P>
<P>
 In voting that coincided with the federal elections, the PRI and PAN 
candidates have alternated first place as the votes have been tallied. With 120 
precincts left to count, the PRI candidate was barely 5,000 votes ahead. If the 
PAN wins, Monterrey, capital of the state of Nuevo Leon, will become the 
largest city ever turned over to an opposition mayor. Further complicating 
matters, the races for the Nuevo Leon legislature are also close. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the old system, conditions would be perfect for negotiation. One party 
would take the mayorship, the other the legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 How party leaders resolve the race will tell a lot about their commitment to 
respecting the voters' will, analysts said. In such a close race, negotiation 
is still possible, especially because the decisions are being made by a state 
and local electoral boards that are less closely scrutinized than the federal 
body. 
</P>
<P>
 The PAN has documented a variety of electoral code violations that could 
nullify the votes in dozens of precincts. 
</P>
<P>
 "One party could protest the vote in certain polling places and the other 
could allow those precincts to be nullified," Creel said. "That would change 
the tally." 
</P>
<P>
 Electoral authorities cannot impose election results if the parties are 
determined to keep settling close elections by negotiating, he said, adding, 
"It depends on the political will of the parties."

FIVE DEA AGENTS KILLED IN CRASH IN PERUVIAN JUNGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five special U.S. narcotics agents died when a drug reconnaissance flight 
crashed in Peru's northeastern jungle, the Drug Enforcement Administration said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 DEA officials in Peru said that the wreckage was spotted by satellite Sunday 
afternoon near Puerto Pizana in the foothills of the Andes but that heavy rains 
in the area prevented rescue workers from reaching the site, about 250 miles 
north of Lima. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue workers Sunday began hacking their way through the jungle but were 
halted by bad weather and nightfall, the DEA said. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to reach the wreckage will resume today, the DEA said. 
</P>
<P>
 The names of the victims -- a pilot and co-pilot from the U.S. base at Santa 
Lucia and three agents based in Lima -- were not available late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency twin-engine CASA transport left Santa Lucia on Saturday afternoon 
en route to the coca-producing Upper Huallaga Valley and was declared missing 
about 5 p.m., the DEA in Lima said.

TWISTERS KILL 4, RIP HOMES IN WISCONSIN; DISASTER: TORNADOES SMASH THROUGH FARM 
COMMUNITIES, CAUSING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN DAMAGE. NATIONAL GUARD SENT TO 
HELP.

 Shirley Andersen looked up from the floor and saw her house was gone, ripped 
away by a tornado. A couple in their 60s rode out the storm in their bathtub. 
The town hall was squashed "like a soda can." 
</P>
<P>
 Four people were killed as tornadoes tore across Wisconsin during the night 
Saturday, ripping up small communities and farms. 
</P>
<P>
 One tornado gouged a 13-mile-long swath through central Wisconsin and turned 
this small town's main street into a tangle of metal, lumber and trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage from the tornado in Adams County, where Big Flats is located, was 
estimated at $4.5 million, Sheriff Robert Farber said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies of an elderly couple were found in the wreckage of their home near 
Big Flats. Twenty-two people were injured and five remained hospitalized 
Sunday, Farber said. Authorities knew of 24 houses destroyed and about 175 
damaged in Adams County. 
</P>
<P>
 A tornado in Eau Claire County in western Wisconsin killed a 3-year-old girl 
when a mobile home was blown into a ditch. A woman riding in a van that was 
blown off a highway also died. 
</P>
<P>
 More tornadoes touched down in Green Lake and Juneau counties, wrecking houses 
and barns and leaving dead cattle in pastures. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams County Emergency Government Director Frank Zernia estimated that up to 
400 of the 740 residents of Big Flats, about 80 miles north of Madison, were 
affected by the tornado. 
</P>
<P>
 National Guard Capt. Scott Meske, one of 40 Guardsmen sent to the area, said 
the municipal building looked as though it was crushed "like a soda can." 
</P>
<P>
 Big Flats residents Bob Geiger, 65, and his wife, Marion, 60, rode out the 
storm in their bathtub as their roof was torn off and windows were shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 Geiger said they crawled into the tub because it seemed like the safest place. 
"Glass was flying, you could hardly see anything. Things were whirling around," 
he said. "I was really scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Andersen, 58, looking at the wreckage of her mobile home Sunday 
morning, said the last thing she remembered before the twister hit was the 
lights going out and her husband reaching for a candle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hit the floor. It seemed like a half a second later I raised my head up 
from the floor and looked to the north and there was nothing there. Everything 
was gone," she said.

POLITICS; HIGH STAKES FOR BOTH PARTIES IN 3 KEY TENNESSEE RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK THOMAS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tennessee, the state where Andrew Jackson hammered together the Democratic 
Party, is shaping up as a microcosm of the 1994 national elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, a new governor and two U.S. senators will be elected. Democrats control 
all three offices, and Republicans are smelling blood. As evidence of the 
importance attached to the contests, both parties may spend more money per 
voter than in any other state. 
</P>
<P>
 SENATE: Fred Dalton Thompson, the Watergate minority counsel turned Hollywood 
actor, won the Republican primary to face Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper in the 
contest for Vice President Al Gore's unexpired term. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, a 40-year-old former Rhodes scholar and son of a former governor, 
achieved national recognition by being one of the first Democrats to challenge 
President Clinton's health care plan, devising his own alternative proposal, 
which he called "Clinton-light." 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates have already spent a little more than $1 million each, with 
Thompson facing token opposition and Cooper unopposed in the primaries. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other Senate race, Sen. Jim Sasser, the Budget Committee chairman who 
wants to become Senate majority leader next year, is seeking a fourth term. He 
already has a $3-million war chest. 
</P>
<P>
 He is opposed by Republican Bill Frist, a Nashville surgeon who made a fortune 
in the health care business. Frist raised $2.2 million for his fiercely 
contested primary -- more than $1 million from his own pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 GOVERNOR: Republican Rep. Don Sundquist will face Nashville's Democratic Mayor 
Phil Bredesen, another wealthy health care businessman. Bredesen spent more 
than $10 per vote in his primary race -- $3 million for 270,000 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent Mason-Dixon poll shows Sundquist slightly ahead of Bredesen. 
</P>
<P>
 Loss of Gore's old seat and the governorship to GOP control clearly would bode 
ill for a Clinton-Gore reelection campaign in 1996. A loss by Sasser would be 
seen as a catastrophe by Democrats, who are fighting to retain control of the 
Senate this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican Senate candidates are already pushing their races as 
referendums on the Clinton Administration. The Democrats are steering clear of 
the President, who won only 47% of the vote here despite having Gore on the 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Sasser, a liberal, has been seen mainly in Reaganesque commercials touting 
family values. Cooper said after the primary: "I represent Tennessee -- nobody 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thompson-Cooper race is the closest so far. Thompson trailed Cooper by 11 
percentage points in a poll in May, mainly because the Democratic congressman 
surpassed him in name recognition. But a more recent Frank Luntz poll shows the 
gap has narrowed to eight points. 
</P>
<P>
 Presumably, the celebrity of Thompson for his prominent roles in such films as 
"Die Hard II" and in movies starring Kevin Costner, Clint Eastwood, Sean 
Connery and Harrison Ford will help. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Thompson and Cooper are wealthy -- Cooper is one of the richest men in 
the House -- but the congressman has already raised more than $3 million, about 
twice what Thompson has. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Cooper is raising money has raised some eyebrows. After he proclaimed 
that he would take no contributions from political action committees, it was 
reported that the health care industry was "bundling" contributions to him 
(having employees send money as individuals) by the hundreds of thousands of 
dollars and making him their No. 1 one recipient of donations in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cooper's made health care a money tree," a Thompson spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans also are hopeful about their chances in contests for three open 
congressional seats in the state -- two are now held by Democrats, and one by a 
Republican. All three districts could change hands, giving the Republicans an 
extra seat.

ISRAEL OKS GREATER AUTONOMY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel's Cabinet approved expanding some aspects of Palestinian autonomy 
throughout the West Bank despite weekend violence by Islamic militants who 
killed two Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan negotiated last week in Cairo gives the Palestinians control over 
education, health, welfare, taxes and tourism. It excludes east Jerusalem and 
Jewish settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's vote by the 14-member Cabinet was unanimous, the ministers said. The 
timetable remains to be negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 But they warned that further progress was conditional on efforts by 
Palestinian authorities to stop terror attacks and catch those responsible for 
the stabbing deaths Friday of two Israeli construction workers in Ramle, a 
suburb of Tel Aviv.

REPORT REVEALS SPY AGENCIES' BUDGET PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Defense Department intends to ask Congress to approve a $27-billion, 
six-year spending plan for the super-secret National Security Agency and two 
other intelligence groups, a trade publication reports. 
</P>
<P>
 In a story published in this week's edition, Defense Week said it obtained 
internal Pentagon documents that spelled out the budget requests as approved by 
John M. Deutch, the deputy defense secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures are for the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence 
Agency and the Central Imagery Office. They do not include budgets for the two 
other main intelligence agencies -- the CIA and the National Reconnaissance 
Office, which develops and operates the nation's spy satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are the budgets of these individual agencies classified secret, but 
the government's overall intelligence budget is secret too. Defense Week 
apparently is the first to publish official figures for budgets of the NSA, the 
DIA and the imagery agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Week said it got the budget figures from an Aug. 16 memorandum signed 
by Deutch. 
</P>
<P>
 It said the National Security Agency, which is responsible for intercepting 
and processing foreign communications as well as safeguarding U.S. voice 
transmissions, had a fiscal 1995 budget request of $3.47 billion. For the 
six-year period of 1996 through 2001, the Pentagon will ask that NSA get a 
total of $21.4 billion, Defense Week said. 
</P>
<P>
 The request for the Defense Intelligence Agency, which is responsible for the 
collection and processing of military intelligence, totals about $4 billion for 
the 1996-2001 period, Defense Week said. Its 1995 request was $621.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Central Imagery Office, which coordinates the dissemination of satellite 
imagery for military use, asked for $122.6 million in 1995. The Pentagon wants 
it to get $1.5 billion for the 1996-2001 period, Defense Week said.

KENTUCKY TOBACCO RIGHTS ACTIVISTS BURN EFFIGY OF FIRST LADY AT RALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a congressman, a state senator and a gubernatorial candidate stood nearby, 
an effigy of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was doused with gasoline and 
burned at a tobacco rally protesting President Clinton's health care plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Burn, baby, burn," chanted Stan Arachikavitz, president of the Kentucky Assn. 
of Tobacco Supporters.About 100 people gathered at twilight Saturday to protest 
Administration plans to hike cigarette taxes to fund health reform. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. David Boswell, a Democrat who spoke at the rally, said later he was 
unaware that the effigy was to be burned. "I don't support that. I disagree 
with a lot of the policies that are coming out of Washington. But that was out 
of line," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Ron Lewis (R-Ky.) told the crowd: "If we don't stand up for tobacco, 
we'll go down with it." Also speaking was Matthew Wills, a Republican candidate 
for Congress in central Kentucky.

VACATIONING CLINTONS HEAR SERMON OF REST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton attended services Sunday at an open-air tabernacle and 
promptly became a convert of the minister, who stressed the need to balance 
work and play, "even if you're the President." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, on the second full day of his vacation on Martha's Vineyard, later 
had breakfast at a restaurant with First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and 
daughter Chelsea and then went directly to a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons sat in the first pew of the Martha's Vineyard Camp Meeting Assn. 
tabernacle, a 59-year-old religious camp that has a permanent circular roof and 
open sides. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 500 people crowded toward the front, prompting the Rev. Edward 
Vander Hey to joke: "This is the first time I've been in church and watched it 
fill up from the front to the back." 
</P>
<P>
 Vander Hey delivered a sermon that stressed the need to balance the pressures 
of work with time to relax. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of us are too important to take a vacation . . . no matter how important 
we are. Even a President needs to take some time off," the minister said. 
</P>
<P>
 The President didn't waste any time before taking Vander Hey's advice. He 
drove directly from church to the Farm Neck Golf Club, changing into golf 
clothes in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, as he stood at the first tee, admitted being inspired by the 
minister's dispensation. "Yeah, I needed that," he told reporters with a grin.

EXPERTS SAY LOW-INCOME HOUSING PROGRAM NOT EASILY ABUSED; TAX CREDITS: GARY 
LEFKOWITZ'S ALLEGED MISDEEDS BEGAN IN THE PROGRAM'S EARLY YEARS, WHEN 
REGULATORY OVERSIGHT WAS MINIMAL, AUTHORITIES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD W. NAUSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Housing experts and regulators say the misconduct alleged in the Gary 
Lefkowitz case does not indicate that the low-income housing tax-credit program 
is susceptible to easy abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 But some government and industry officials acknowledge that regulatory 
oversight was minimal in the program's early years, when Lefkowitz was gaining 
a foothold as a syndicator of low-income housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The experts say the misdeeds of which he is accused amount to securities fraud 
that could as easily have involved oil wells or windmills as low-income 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson, they say: Any government program can be subverted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because someone abuses the system does not mean the system is flawed," said 
John McEvoy, executive director of the National Council of State Housing 
Agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 When the tax credits first became available, some states had to quickly create 
and fund agencies to run the program. The regulations were complex and little 
understood. It often was unclear whether the state or federal government was 
responsible for enforcing regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, compliance monitoring often was superficial, said James Solem, 
former commissioner of the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency. For instance, it 
was not clear that state agencies had the right to demand financing details 
from developers or syndicators, he said, because no direct government subsidy 
was being provided. 
</P>
<P>
 "You ended up with a system where the ability to get full disclosure was 
nearly impossible," Solem said. 
</P>
<P>
 Confusion also arose because oversight was dispersed among 50 state housing 
agencies, the Internal Revenue Service and state and federal securities 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Rules varied widely from state to state. Some states reserved tax credits on a 
developer's word that permanent financing was in place and then issued the 
credits when told a project was finished -- without ever inspecting the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both its complexity and decentralized administration opens the program up to 
possible corruption," said Peter Drier, former director of Boston's housing 
program, who now is a professor of public policy at Occidental College in Eagle 
Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rules have tightened. 
</P>
<P>
 A study by a task force of state housing agencies recommended close monitoring 
of building costs, limits on developer and consultant fees, required site 
visits and stronger penalties for fraudulently obtaining tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more and more safeguards being added each year," said Michael 
Novogradac, a San Francisco accountant and low-income housing expert. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, abuses are less a concern to most housing experts than is the program's 
efficiency. Critics argue that the credits cost too much and produce too little 
housing. They note that about half of every dollar of tax credit is eaten up by 
fees paid consultants, lawyers and syndicators. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like feeding the horses to feed the sparrows," said Dreier, who argues 
that direct grants to developers or tenants would be more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the criticism, the program has widespread, bipartisan support; more 
than 400 members of Congress sponsored the bill last year making it a permanent 
part of the tax code. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is that it is the only game in town. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has provided more than 600,000 affordable housing units in the 
last seven years. About 125,000 units are expected to be built this year at a 
cost to the federal treasury of nearly $3 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the program is dominated by powerful players. Boston Financial Group 
and Related Capital Corp. are major syndicators that often work with nonprofit 
groups, such as the Local Initiatives Support Corp. Most equity now comes from 
rich corporations such as Bank of America, Chevron and Campbell Soup.

O.C. CREMATORY, FORMERLY A LONELY PLACE, NOW DRAWS CROWDS; CUSTOMS: A WORKER

TO SEE LOVED ONES DEPART FOR THE NEXT LIFE.

<P>
 For 34 years, Al Ramos has fired up the jet engine roar of Fairhaven Memorial 
Park's basement crematory. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of that time, it was a hot, lonely job. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, however, when Ramos strains his 5 feet, 4 inches to heft a casket 
into the crematory and punches the buttons that reduce a body to an urn full of 
ashes, he often has an audience any preacher would pray for. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten, 20, sometimes 60 -- and once 200 -- Southeast Asian Buddhists crowd in 
shifts into his 14-by-20-foot crematory, eager to watch a loved one leave for 
another life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time, I didn't like it," said Ramos, whose shyness quickly gives 
way to a torrent of talk. "I'm so nervous with somebody watching because I'm 
afraid I'll do something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past five years, the wiry Mexican native has become accustomed to 
hearing the chanting as processions of mourners and monks in yellow robes begin 
carrying a casket from the funeral home half a mile away to the mausoleum. He 
has even gotten used to having his every movement scrutinized. 
</P>
<P>
 But he has had to draw more than one line with the mourners jockeying for 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 No more sneaking plates, glasses and cutlery of the deceased into the coffins. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they open the casket, everybody crowds around and puts stuff in there -- 
flowers, pictures of people, money, jewelry -- and I can't see anything," said 
Ramos, who came to California in 1943. "Sometimes you don't know what goes in 
there until you try to clean the furnace and you find the muck." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the prohibition, one man recently brought in his dead relative's 
entire place setting to be used in the next life, Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Hey, never do that.' But he's waiting over there, and all the 
relatives are waiting over there, so I just had to put it in." 
</P>
<P>
 With a frustrated sigh, Ramos opened the steel crematory doors and leaned into 
the hot darkness to show where tiny pieces of glass remain embedded in the 
furnace's floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos no longer welcomes help loading the coffin. 
</P>
<P>
 One eager mourner crashed a casket into the crematory's clay wall, creating a 
divot in the $60,000 furnace. 
</P>
<P>
 And no more pacemakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a bomb in there. First time I hear one go off, it's like BOOM!" 
Ramos said. The explosion left a spider web of cracks in the crematory wall. 
</P>
<P>
 And, if Ramos had his way -- which he doesn't because this is business -- 
there would be no one but him pushing the buttons that fire up the crematory. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, relatives of the deceased, or sometimes the Buddhist monk presiding 
over the service, have wanted to control the cremation itself, Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to get so mad with the morticians over there. This is mine. This is my 
job," Ramos said. "According to the mortician, I have to do what people want, 
harrumph." 
</P>
<P>
 So, Ramos leads mourners back into his previously private domain to push the 
blower button, which begins to heat the crematory with a sound akin to a jumbo 
jet, then the afterburner button and then, when the gauge reaches 800 degrees, 
the main burner button. 
</P>
<P>
 The crematory will remain on for three hours, about the time it takes to 
reduce the body to ash and bits of bone, which are later ground up with the ash 
and placed in an urn. Ramos takes pride in never having mingled an ash or 
shipped remains to the wrong family. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people say ashes to ashes, dust to dust. That's not true. You have 
to grind the bones," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos took over running the 58-year-old crematory -- the first in Orange 
County -- at his boss's request just after President John F. Kennedy was 
assassinated. He lasted a year at the job before the never-ending march of 
bodies from the Vietnam War caused him to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started losing weight," Ramos said. "At that time the bodies came just in 
parts . . . just wrapped in sheets. I told my boss, 'I need to work outside for 
a while.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Ramos was soon back. "I don't know, for me it's like a magnet. I like to 
be lonesome. No one bothers me here." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, Ramos got another job, working at a pharmaceutical company from 5 
a.m. to 2 p.m. each day, before heading to Fairhaven to work from 3 p.m. to 
midnight. For 22 years, Ramos said, he never told his daytime co-workers how he 
moonlighted, afraid they would think he was contaminated. He retired from his 
daytime job three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Friends say I'm really crazy. 'You mean you work nights over there?' I say, 
what's wrong with that? I don't believe in spooks," he said. "I believe when a 
person dies he goes to heaven, or he goes to hell. How can he come back? He has 
no blood, no bones, no circulation." 
</P>

 Once, about 15 years ago, Ramos tried to retire but his boss begged him to 
come back. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can't find nobody to do the job like me," he said. Ramos said there has 
been one constant in the three decades he has manned the crematory. Each day on 
his arrival home, his wife has greeted him with the same refrain: "Take a 
shower. Leave your clothes in the garage."

BREAKING UP THE PARTY ON THE BOARDWALK; VENICE: HAMMER-WIELDING RESIDENTS 
ALLEGEDLY SMASH PICNIC TABLES THEY SAY ARE USED FOR RAUCOUS LATE-NIGHT MEETING 
SITES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Fed up with nightly drug dealing, gang fights, arguments among homeless people 
and bursts of loud music centered around picnic tables on the boardwalk, 
several Venice residents allegedly donned masks and hoods early Sunday, set a 
watch for the police and then sledgehammered the four tables to bits -- to the 
reported applause of watching residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would call this positive vandalism," said one Venice resident who asked not 
to be named. "I'm a Buddhist, and there's a principle in the (Buddhist) law 
that you can break the law if there's a greater law." 
</P>
<P>
 The marble and concrete tables at Westminster Avenue and Ocean Front Walk had 
become a focal point of hostility because of the noise coming from the popular 
late-night meeting place. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents routinely complained to police, and during the day, a heavy police 
presence kept order in the area. But at night, chaos reigned, some residents 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, chaos is what greeted merchant Phil Saren on Sunday morning when he 
went to open his business, Phil's Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just shocked when I saw it, it's such a mess," Saren said. "Vandalism 
is always a bad idea, but I understood this is quite a problem for the locals 
-- even though it was a good thing for the merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this was not just ordinary vandalism," Saren said. "Those were concrete 
tables and it took quite some energy. This was done out of anger. The pressure 
was building up and the anger was building up. You can tell." 
</P>
<P>
 The Venice resident who asked not to be named detailed the destruction: 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got home last night, someone came over to me and told me that if I 
heard noise coming from that area not to call the police, that they were going 
to sledgehammer the tables." 
</P>
<P>
 "One came and watched for a police car. They all had ski masks and hoods on 
and huge sledgehammers, and they attacked the tables," he said. "After they 
were well demolished, 80 or 90 people at different windows were applauding." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Division police considered the table-smashing to be almost a 
non-incident and had to hunt through their logs for details. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we have are three to four benches and tables between 2 and 3 o'clock this 
morning were smashed, we've been told by witnesses," said spokesman Don Cox, 
who confirmed reports of drug sales and nightly noise in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody told somebody else that there were three intoxicated male Caucasians 
out there. Parks and (Recreation) showed up this morning and found the things 
destroyed," Cox said. The tables are city property, worth about $1,200 each, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 To boardwalk merchants and regulars, however, the tables were anything but 
insignificant. For merchants, they were encouragement for boardwalk strollers 
to grab a slice of pizza and sit down in front of their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 To some of the artists and entertainers -- Tarot card readers, jugglers, 
acrobats, musicians and other sidewalk performers -- they represented a threat 
to their livelihood, gobbling up space that could be used to entertain the 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 For residents, however, they could be a headache. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Westminster situation is unique because you don't notice anyone 
going out and destroying the tables at Market (Street, a different location)," 
said Mark Ryavec, executive director of the Venice Boardwalk Assn. "It seems 
that Westminster is a local thoroughfare of illegal drug sales and people are 
just fed up." 
</P>
<P>
 Drug dealing was a problem at the same site years ago, when pagoda-roofed 
wooden shelters attracted gang members, Ryavec said. The drug problem moved on 
when a frustrated resident rammed them with a truck and destroyed them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once these picnic tables went back in, it re-created the problem," Ryavec 
said. "I certainly don't condone or accept that as a reasonable solution to the 
problem of late-night noise, but if it was residents -- and I don't know who 
did it -- you can understand their motivation. It's really chaos there." 
</P>
<P>
 Drug dealing and noise are only part of the problem in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting between black and Latino gangs in the Oakwood section of Venice has 
claimed 17 lives and left at least 55 people wounded in the last 11 months.  
</P>
<P>
 In early June, two Latino students at Dorsey High School in Southwest Los 
Angeles were killed in a drive-by shooting near Venice High School by 
assailants described as black.

STREET SMART / RICHARD SIMON: LITTLE APPRECIATION FOR MTA TOKENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buddy, can you spare a token?  
</P>
<P>
 With the MTA bus fare going up Thursday from $1.10 to $1.35, the 90-cent token 
is the best transit bargain in town. 
</P>
<P>
 So says the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which accepts tokens in 
lieu of the $1.35 cash fare. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't tell that to bus and train riders who can no longer buy monthly 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only will they have to pay more for the pleasure of using public transit, 
they'll have to chase after buses and trains with their pockets jingling all 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to make things a lot more inconvenient," grumbled Stephen 
Linowiecki, who rides buses and trains between his Torrance home and Pasadena 
job but now plans to return to solo commuting. 
</P>
<P>
 He may be alone in his car but not on the freeway. The MTA has projected at 
least a 5% drop in ridership because of the new fare policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Linowiecki and other riders are angry over the MTA's decision last month to 
increase fares and eliminate monthly bus passes for all but the disabled, 
elderly and students. 
</P>
<P>
 The passes, which have been in use for decades, were popular because riders 
did not have to worry about fumbling around for exact change every time they 
boarded a bus or the Blue Line or Red Line. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials said they eliminated the passes because the truly disadvantaged 
couldn't afford the $42 price and ended up subsidizing those who could. 
Officials also said the passes were subject to counterfeiting. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to soften the blow from the fare hike and elimination of regular 
monthly passes, the MTA has been promoting use of discount tokens. 
</P>
<P>
 The tokens also are less costly for the MTA to process than the dollar bills 
that are often stuffed into fare boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are encouraging people using dollar bills to use tokens," said Marcelo 
Melicor, supervisor of the MTA's cash-counting operations. "Besides getting a 
good price on tokens, it can help us. The tokens are easier to process." Tokens 
can be counted by a machine, unlike dollar bills, which must be processed by 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, tokens are used by only about 6% of MTA riders. The transit agency 
has increased its supply of tokens from 5 million to 25 million. They're sold 
in bags of 10 for $9. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA also has increased token sales outlets from 350 to 460. 
</P>
<P>
 That may seem like a lot. But try finding a convenient place that sells 
tokens. 
</P>
<P>
 To make it easier to spot sales outlets, the MTA has supplied stores with 
signs that read "WOW" -- a token appears in place of the 'o' -- to be posted up 
there with those familiar Lotto signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the discount tokens, riders losing monthly passes complain that they 
will be bearing a heavy burden -- namely a pocket full of metal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so easy to have a bus pass," said Julie Walker, who has used a pass to 
commute from her Hollywood home to Kaiser Permanente in Pasadena. "Sometimes, 
you don't have exact change. . . . When you have the bus pass, you just don't 
think about it." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that when she has to carry change, "people bug you for money. It's 
going to be a hassle."  
</P>
<P>
 Linowiecki, who lives in Torrance, rides the Blue Line and Red Line to Union 
Station, where he catches a company shuttle to his Pasadena job. He has used 
public transit because of the convenience of flashing a $42 bus pass, of which 
$21 has been paid for by his company. (The passes have been popular among 
companies, which have offered them to employees at a discount as a way to 
reduce solo commuting as required by air pollution laws. Many firms now will 
buy vouchers called TransitCheks, which are redeemable for tokens.) 
</P>
<P>
 With passes being eliminated, Linowiecki said he will need to buy a ticket 
every time he wants to board a train -- whether or not he uses tokens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is going to have to use the machines, and that creates a problem, 
especially if you're having to run for a train," he said. "I'm going back to 
the car. I'm not going to hassle with the ticket machines, having to stop and 
buy tokens, make sure I have the right change." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Costley, a paralegal at Arco headquarters in Downtown Los Angeles who 
commutes by bus from San Pedro, also is unhappy about the elimination of the 
bus pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most outrageous thing is the tokens don't even cover the whole zone," he 
said. "You have to pay cash in addition." 
</P>
<P>
 He figured his $3.35 ride from San Pedro to Downtown Los Angeles will cost 
three tokens plus 20 cents. (A token is only good for the first $1.35 cents of 
the fare. Tokens can be used for the additional fare but are worth only 90 
cents.) 
</P>
<P>
 "So, I'm carrying six tokens plus 40 cents each way every day," he grumbled. 
"This is one more thing you have to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
 David Brancaccio, a monthly pass user, recalls being short a dime at a bus 
stop. "There I was, a middle-class commuter out on the street begging for a 
dime," he said. "Maybe I'll have to spend more time on the street corner 
begging." 
</P>
<P>
 Exact change, please. 
</P>

ARENA PROPOSAL HEATS UP RACE FOR NEW FACILITY; SPORTS: DEVELOPERS UNVEIL PLANS 
FOR 20,000-SEAT BUILDING NEXT TO HARBOR FREEWAY. FOUR DOWNTOWN SITES ARE 
COMPETING FOR TEAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL LIEBERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The developers of a prime piece of property along the Harbor Freeway have 
unveiled plans for a 20,000-seat Downtown sports arena, heating up the race to 
build a cutting-edge facility for basketball and hockey games in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 A partnership that includes Hillman Properties, one of the nation's largest 
real estate developers, has met in the last two weeks with officials of the 
three local teams that might use such an arena -- the Clippers, Lakers and 
Kings -- to seek their participation in the privately financed project, which 
could cost up to $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
 As envisioned by the architects -- who recently designed arenas in Boston, 
Philadelphia, Phoenix and Portland -- the Los Angeles facility would include 
162 enclosed "luxury suites," the high-priced seating relished by sport 
franchises these days but lacking in this area's two aging pro basketball and 
hockey venues, the Forum in Inglewood and the Los Angeles Memorial Sports 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Another showcase feature of the Harbor Freeway arena would be a two-story 
restaurant for box holders with glass walls overlooking the downtown skyline on 
one side and the basketball court -- or hockey rink -- on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a frenzy going on right now to build state-of-the-art arenas. We're 
trying to go one step further, (to) the next generation," said the project's 
marketing director, John H. Semcken III. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, "The teams are going to control this deal. (If) we don't get 
picked by the teams, we don't do this." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Clippers, Lakers and Kings confirmed meeting with the 
development group, but withheld detailed comment on the proposal because of the 
sensitive nature of the negotiations to determine which teams -- and location 
-- might win the competition to get a showplace arena. 
</P>
<P>
 A flurry of competing projects include three others Downtown: one atop Union 
Station, another at the Los Angeles Convention Center and a third at "the 
cornfields," old rail yards near Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, "There are a couple of people who have some sites that they don't 
wish to disclose," said Lakers' owner Jerry Buss. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, impressive proposals for sports arenas and stadiums have been 
floated often in Los Angeles over the last decade, only to go nowhere in the 
area's slumping economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the push for action has gained momentum recently with the emergence of new 
majority owners of the Kings. They have echoed -- with urgency -- the longtime 
plea of Clippers management that some new arena must be built here unless the 
current ones, the Sports Arena and Forum, are overhauled to match the glittery 
sports halls sprouting up around the country.  
</P>
<P>
 "You see Boston, Philadelphia, Portland, Phoenix, Chicago, Detroit, to name a 
few, all undertaking new indoor arenas," said Joseph M. Cohen, the chairman of 
the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 "My instincts are that the timing is right for a new building in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lakers' owner Buss, who owns the Forum, said he still considers it 
"superlative," but noted that "you can take the most beautiful structure in the 
world (and) new innovations make it obsolete." 
</P>
<P>
 So Buss does not rule out construction of a new arena at the Forum's Inglewood 
site or even moving elsewhere -- probably in a joint venture with the Kings, 
who currently lease the Forum from him. "I've looked at every (arena proposal) 
that's been presented," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Roeser, executive vice president of the Clippers, acknowledged only that 
he met last week with the owners of the Harbor Freeway site. 
</P>
<P>
 Roeser has said in the past, however, that the team is intent on being the one 
to "step forward and get a new building" -- in part because of the belief that, 
because of the cost, only one arena proposal will become reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Clippers will play seven games during the coming season at the 
new Pond in Anaheim, Roeser said the team is committed to finding a "landmark 
facility" in the heart of Los Angeles. Burbank had been mentioned as a 
potential site as well, but city officials there say that project is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been through countless different sites that have been proposed," Roeser 
said. "At some point you arrive at the serious players." 
</P>
<P>
 The newest player, the Harbor Freeway site, offers the allure of high 
visibility -- an arena there would all but hang over the western side of the 
busy thoroughfare, directly across from Downtown's upscale office district. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The project, which would stretch between 4th and Maryland streets -- now 
mostly parking lots -- is a joint venture of Pittsburgh-based Hillman 
Properties and the local Smith & Hricik Urban Development Inc. The same 
interests had been planning to use the site for a $1-billion office-hotel 
project, the Los Angeles Center, but "all of us know what happened to the 
office market," Semcken said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recruited to design the arena was the architectural firm Ellerbe Becket, which 
has been responsible for many sports projects, from construction of the America 
West Arena in Phoenix to renovation of New York's Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Semcken said the goal was to create a "destination entertainment superblock" 
including movie theaters and restaurants, to attract some of the huge work 
force that now deserts Downtown after dark, while drawing outsiders as well. 
The location also means there are thousands of parking spaces already within 
walking distance, in the area's office towers, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 To get any arena built, however, the proponents will have to survive a 
competition as fierce, and complex, as any NBA or NHL contest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Catellus Development Corp. has been working for several years to get an 
arena at Union Station. Ted Tanner, vice president for development, touts that 
location's status as a hub of mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many options in and around Downtown," Tanner noted. "We think we 
have a very viable one." 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the race is the Southern Pacific Transportation Co., which owns the 
45-acre rail yards at the edge of Chinatown. "We're still in negotiations with 
the Clippers and some other people I can't name at this time," said David 
Steel, the company's vice president for real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have the best location," Steel said, citing the abundance of open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 But he and the others acknowledge that the competition probably will not hinge 
so much on the site as on deal-making -- who can offer teams the best 
incentives. Up for negotiation are everything from ownership stakes in the 
arenas to shares of the various "revenue streams," from food concessions to 
parking. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Further complicating the situation is the fact that while it is possible to 
operate an arena with one team -- as at the Pond, which showcases the Mighty 
Ducks hockey team -- it is much more desirable to have at least two: one 
basketball and one hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 That creates an intriguing interplay among the three teams in question. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, whose lease at the Sports Arena runs just three more years, have 
the greatest freedom to move. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lakers' owner Buss has considerable leverage by having a say over two 
franchises -- his own and the Kings, due to the long-term lease for that team 
to play at his Forum. Owning the Inglewood property could limit Buss' options, 
though -- if he moved the Lakers, he'd have to sell the Forum or try to make it 
work primarily on non-sports events, such as concerts and other shows. "It 
would require a substantial change of strategy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings, meanwhile, have the advantage of being the only hockey team in the 
equation, even if they are encumbered by their Forum lease. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're related by blood with the Forum, so you start with your relatives," 
chairman Cohen said. "There are a lot of advantages in staying -- the fans have 
been coming to Inglewood for 27 years. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "(But) as much as we like Inglewood, it's important we listen to sites like 
the Harbor Freeway site. . . . It's central. They have some dynamic plans." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Semcken said at least one of the teams has told his group it wants to make a 
decision "by the fall," so construction could begin in the spring -- and a new 
arena be ready for the 1997-98 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a travesty we don't have a state-of-the-art sports arena in Los 
Angeles, the entertainment capital of the world," he said. "If it's not ours, 
the community needs to do it somewhere." New Arena Proposed A plan to build a 
20,000-seat sports arena along the Harbor Freeway will have to compete with 
three other proposals for facilities Downtown. The map below shows the four 
competing Downtown sites for a basketball and hockey arean.

FOR THE LAKE'S SAKE; KEEPING ALGAE GROWTH DOWN, WATER LEVEL UP TAKES DELICATE 
BALANCING ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Westlake Village resident Ben Schulman constantly tinkers with the formula for 
serenity on Westlake Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Kill too much algae and light will cause weeds on the lake floor to sprout as 
much as six inches a day. Let the algae grow, and within days a green carpet 
will grow thick enough to virtually prevent a duck from getting its feet wet 
crossing the lake.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've got some very difficult problems to deal with both technically and 
financially," explained Schulman, president of the Westlake Lake Property Assn. 
"And we're devoting almost all of our time to solving them." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to coping with the ever-regenerating algae, Schulman said, the 
artificial lake's engineers have struggled daily to keep it full while losing 
up to 1,000 gallons each minute to evaporation in the summer heat.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, Schulman said, they have been able to refill the lake fast enough to 
conceal the problem from the nearly 1,200 residents who gaze out at it every 
day.  
</P>
<P>
 The 150-acre lake, which straddles the border between Ventura and Los Angeles 
counties, remains a scene of tranquillity, where it is common to spy a blue 
heron in flight or a sailboat gliding along in the breeze.  
</P>
<P>
 Residents such as William Murphy say the beauty of the lake is a cure for the 
discomfort of summer swelter. "In front of my house it may be summer, but in 
back of my house it's always fall," he said, the water lapping up against his 
deck. "You always feel a little bit cooler when you're looking out at the 
lake." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It has not, however, been a summer of calm for Schulman. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, the lake is fed by surface runoff from the surrounding 18 square 
miles. In years of low rainfall, engineers compensate by tapping into two wells 
that collect water from an aquifer. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy precipitation two years ago provided enough runoff to keep the lake full 
for the entire summer, and the wells didn't operate all season. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the wells began pumping during the first week in June and have not 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 The lake loses water in three ways. Evaporation, if unchecked, will drop the 
surface five feet during the hottest summer months. The neighboring Westlake 
Golf Course, by virtue of a 30-year-old agreement, siphons off as much as 400 
gallons a minute to irrigate its greens. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, a smaller amount is pushed over a 450-foot-long dam at the east end 
of the lake as required by the state to provide water to areas downstream. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep up with the water loss, Schulman and members of the lake's water 
management committee have begun to talk about building a new well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to improve the efficiency of the two wells we've got, to get it 
to pull more water from the aquifer," Schulman said. "But now we have to 
consider a third well, which is a pretty expensive proposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Money for such a project would come from the yearly dues that residents around 
the lake are assessed. Schulman declined to say how much residents pay, but one 
lakeside resident said his fee for the upkeep runs about $1,300 a year. "You 
get what you pay for, and this is a beautiful lake," Schulman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Few realize the effort it takes to keep the lake beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't know that much about the maintenance of the lake," said Irving 
Wasserman, who lives on the island in the middle of the water. "I see them out 
there chopping away at the algae all the time, but that's about all." 
</P>
<P>
 Algae, Schulman's other main concern, is a problem at many lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year on nearby Lake Sherwood, algae grew with abandon. Dead layers of the 
brownish-green plant filled the air with an odor described by residents as 
sewage-like. 
</P>
<P>
 On Westlake Lake, Murphy said, the plant has at times grown so thick that 
residents have had a hard time maneuvering boats through it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially in the summer, it grows like crazy," he said. 
</P>

 Crosby Fentress, chairman of the property association's water management 
committee, said the algae feeds on dead weeds that have accumulated at the 
bottom in layers as thick as two feet. Also contributing to the fast growth are 
nutrients from the reclaimed water frequently used to irrigate nearby 
neighborhoods, which drains into the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't eliminate it 100%," Fentress said. "You just have to try to keep it 
under control." 
</P>
<P>
 To do that, the property association purchased a $45,000 harvester machine, 
which chops the algae and sucks it off the surface of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 The caretakers also use chemicals in small doses to address the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the lake was new, they used enough chemicals to keep it like a swimming 
pool," Schulman said. "But they learned that if the lake surface was too clear, 
the light would speed up the growth of weeds at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a no-win situation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Hanson, who for many years worked as the lake's engineer, called lake 
management a balancing act. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, it's a scientific process," said Hanson, a chemical engineer. "If you 
manage it well, you end up with something really terrific."

<P>
 Peacefully, the disabled and the dead from the nation's wars coexist on a 
19th-Century military outpost by a 20th-Century freeway next to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before the turn of the century, when health retreats were springing up 
all over Southern California, a federally funded version, the Pacific branch of 
the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers (now the Veterans 
Administration Center), opened its doors in the 600-acre expanse of treeless 
slopes and bush-grown gulches. 
</P>
<P>
 The site, at what is now Wilshire Boulevard and the San Diego Freeway, was 
chosen by the government for its "climate and hygiene" from more than 60 offers 
of free land, including all of Santa Catalina Island. Almost every community in 
Southern California was vying for the $250,000 annual federal budget and more 
than $66,000 in pensions that would come to their neighborhoods with the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The winners in the land giveaway were Nevada Sen. John Percival Jones, a 
silver magnate, and his partner, former Rhode Islander Robert S. Baker. Their 
offer was at the bottom of the government's list, but the 300 free acres were 
sweetened by a gift of $50,000. (The other 300 acres were donated by a ranch 
and a local water company.) 
</P>
<P>
 In return for their generosity, the two land barons hoped that the presence of 
the facility would generate local jobs, attract business -- and prompt people 
to buy land in a new town they owned, Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The renowned architect Stanford White designed the facility, but some soldiers 
couldn't wait for construction to begin. On May 2, 1888, a Civil War veteran, 
Pvt. George Davis of New York, not willing to put up with another New York 
winter, became the first veteran to arrive at the home, taking up residence in 
a tent set up on the grounds. Veterans did not have to be sick or wounded to 
live in the free facility. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Within a year, a thousand eager veterans would follow Davis into the newly 
built institution, including 100 elderly men from Northern California who 
marched 500 miles for free lodgings. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the government would add a library, theater, dining hall, 
chapel, post office, laundry, hospital and more barracks, room for 2,000 
veterans. Rich soil and mild weather made the land surrounding the 
horseshoe-shaped retreat ideal for planting fruit orchards and lima bean and 
barley fields to feed the pensioners and to be sold. 
</P>
<P>
 On the grounds of the home in 1901, thousands of Angelenos hailed President 
William B. McKinley as he addressed Civil War and Spanish-American War 
veterans. Three years earlier, many had answered the President's call for 
volunteers in the conflict with Spain, and now, spruced up in their best 
uniforms, they saluted him. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinley told them: "The government for which you fought, to which you gave 
the best years of your lives . . . that government will see to it that in your 
declining years you shall not suffer" -- here the crowd applauded -- "but shall 
be surrounded with all the comforts and all the blessings which a grateful 
nation can provide." 
</P>
<P>
 Four months after McKinley's visit, he was assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Around the facility that White had designed, houses, duplexes and businesses 
were beginning to spring up to accommodate the growing Westside population, 
some of whom worked at the home. The community became known as Sawtelle, after 
the local banker, W. E. Sawtelle. So wide an influence did the home have that 
some of Sawtelle's streets were named after Civil War battles, such as 
Vicksburg and Gettysburg -- now Stoner and Colby avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 While the federal government attended to the needs of the veterans, a group 
called the Ladies of the Grand Army of the Republic looked after the veterans' 
widows. Along Nevada Avenue -- now Wilshire Boulevard -- the auxiliary group 
built cottages for the women to live in rent-free, and by 1917, the street 
became known as Widows' Row. (Some residents of Widows' Row moved in with the 
intention of getting married to the bachelor veterans nearby. A newspaper at 
the time said "a widow need not remain a widow longer than two weeks in 
Sawtelle.") 
</P>
<P>
 In 1927, the James Wadsworth Hospital opened on the grounds of the home, named 
after a Civil War major and -- not coincidentally -- former president of the 
board of the National Homes for Disabled Veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971, the Sylmar earthquake would lead to the condemnation of the Wadsworth 
hospital. A more modern facility was built in its place, and it was there that 
a festering epidemic of Legionnaire's disease claimed 46 lives between 1977 and 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital and barracks housed more than 4,500 veterans by the early 1960s, 
and another 2,000 in its Brentwood Psychiatric Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the late 1960s, Stanford White's designs had become quaint fire 
hazards. And so the last of the older buildings -- unique and whimsical wood 
structures, with gingerbread trim and wide verandas where some of the 
rocking-chair brigade had sat from dawn to sunset -- were condemned to the 
wrecking ball. 
</P>
<P>
 It spared only the newer buildings and three of the earliest: the chapel, the 
hospital governor's mansion and a Civil War-era house. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, where thousands of war veterans once spent their last years, there stands 
the Veterans' Administration Center, the largest military hospital in the 
nation. CECILIA RASMUSSEN

TITO JACKSON'S EX-WIFE DROWNS IN SWIMMING POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Delores Jackson, the ex-wife of Michael Jackson's brother Tito, accidentally 
drowned in a swimming pool while visiting the Ladera Heights home of her 
boyfriend, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, 39, had been swimming with her boyfriend, Donald Bohana, 58, at his 
home on Holt Avenue about 4 a.m. Saturday.Bohana got out of the pool and left 
briefly. When he returned, he found Jackson at the bottom of the pool, 
Sheriff's Deputy Rich Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson said Bohana pulled Jackson from the water and called 911. Deputies 
did not know how long she had been in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson was taken by ambulance to Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in 
Inglewood, where she was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Investigators believe Jackson died from accidental drowning, but the exact 
cause of death will be determined by the medical examiner," Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Delores Jackson divorced Tito Jackson in 1988 after 16 years of marriage.

O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW; JACKSON HAS HIS MOMENTS; HALF THE IRVINE MEADOWS' SET 
WAS FROM BROWNE'S GLORY DAYS OF WRITING, EMOTIONALLY HEFTY BUT A BIT 
PREDICTABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It wasn't the kind of moment you expect from Jackson Browne. There was the 
perennially empathetic singer-songwriter Saturday at Irvine Meadows, in the 
middle of "Late for the Sky," his melancholy 1974 ballad about the painful 
moment when two people recognize that their love has died. Right after singing 
the line "Now for me some words come easy . . ." he abruptly stopped while the 
band played on behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 Had a painful memory suddenly caught him unaware? Or after two decades of 
playing the title track from what many consider to be his finest album, did he 
simply forget the words? 
</P>
<P>
 Browne hastily cleared his throat, then cleared up the mystery: "I swallowed a 
bug." 
</P>
<P>
 That he actually downed the critter was the real shocker. Given how acutely 
reverent Browne's songs are toward the lives and feelings of each and every 
life on the planet, you'd have expected him to dial 911 and at least attempt a 
rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Missing only a couple of beats, he was back into the lyric and finished the 
song in typically tasteful fashion. An appreciative cheer erupted from the 
fans, who clearly enjoyed the unscripted moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Browne ought to attempt the unexpected a little more often in his music. After 
more than two decades of performing, he's battling the bane of every successful 
artist: predictability. 
</P>
<P>
 Thematically and musically, Browne's songs in recent years have contained few 
surprises. That may explain why half the 20 songs in the set came from his four 
1970s albums. Those songs, and a select few of his latter-day material, gave 
the show more than enough emotional heft. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was hard at times hearing a songwriter of Browne's stature struggle 
at what once seemed to come so easily. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sky Blue and Black," one of the five songs he pulled from his current "I'm 
Alive" album, is lyrically largely a replay of "Late for the Sky"; the chord 
progression in the turn from the verse to the chorus is the same one he used in 
"For Everyman," another song he wrote more than 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 After a while it begins to sniff of the cut-and-paste school of songwriting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean there aren't rewarding moments in his recent material, but 
they are just that: moments. Where his inspiration once stretched for full 
songs and even into a couple of full albums, now he strikes gold on a verse 
here, a melody fragment there. 
</P>
<P>
 In "My Problem Is You," another new one, it's necessary to wade through such 
lyrical chaff as "Our love is a fire / Our love is a wave moving deep in an 
ocean of need and desire" to get the wheat of a line as thought-provoking as 
"For some kinds of pleasure there are no defenses." 
</P>
<P>
 His eight-piece band played everything with enormous skill, though not always 
with ideal musical balance. Drums and bass overpowered Browne's voice 
periodically in the early going, and, during "Too Many Angels," a chorus of 
voices meant to work in counterpoint to Browne's was grossly overamplified. 
</P>
<P>
 Browne has held on to a sizable portion of the following he built in the '70s 
with a string of hit albums and singles. But because his records no longer 
reach the upper regions of the charts, he's not keeping his fan pool constantly 
refilled. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus the 15,000-capacity amphitheater was less than two-thirds full, even in a 
county that Browne, a 1966 graduate of Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton, 
described as "one of the places I call home." 
</P>
<P>
 For the answer to his artistic quandary, Browne need look no farther than his 
opening act. John Hiatt's one-hour set was a singer-songwriter's lesson in how 
to remain fresh when you are two decades beyond singing about the youthful 
quest for perfect love and for justice in an unjust world. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hiatt sang in "Straight Outta Time," from his current "Perfectly Good 
Guitar" album: "I'm never gonna figure out the way that I feel." 
</P>
<P>
 That realization alone leaves him with plenty to write about, from impatient 
youths who don't value the beauty that is at their fingertips ("It breaks my 
heart to see those stars / Smashing a perfectly good guitar") to adults who 
struggle to maintain stable relationships without succumbing to the blahs 
("Cross My Fingers"). 
</P>
<P>
 Hiatt, like Browne, has been recording since the '70s, but in contrast, his 
recent work is so consistently rich that he easily filled the hour without 
dipping into his catalogue farther back than 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since he and his three-man Guilty Dogs band played the Coach House in San Juan 
Capistrano last September, the group has grown considerably tighter. 
</P>
<P>
 They faltered only in the closing rendition of "Tennessee Plates," which raced 
at nearly punk-thrash tempo until the song was rhythmically straitjacketed. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, they locked into everything from the Gibraltar-esque R&B groove of 
"Thing Called Love" to the hard-rock bashing of "Paper Thin" with single-minded 
purposefulness, not to mention the feeling that they were truly having fun.

STANFORD IS STENSTROM'S QUARTERBACKING CLINIC; FOOTBALL: UNDER WALSH'S 
TUTELAGE, EL TORO GRADUATE PREPARES FOR HIS SENIOR SEASON WITH THE CARDINAL, 
AND POSSIBLY THE NFL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stanford's Steve Stenstrom takes the snap, drops back and faces a decision 
most college quarterbacks only dream of making one day. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco wide receiver Jerry Rice is open on a deep fly pattern, as 
usual. 
</P>
<P>
 Tight end Jamie Williams looks good crossing over the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 And how about Roger Craig, who's free coming out of the backfield? 
</P>
<P>
 Stenstrom gets an NFL preview during off-season workouts, when current and 
former pro players work out at Stanford under the scrutiny of their former 
coach, Bill Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh, Stanford's coach the past two seasons, is grooming Stenstrom for his 
senior season . . . and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys like Jerry (Rice) give me a lot of confidence telling me that I throw 
the ball well," said Stenstrom, a former El Toro High standout. "You never know 
what to expect going to the next level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've thrown with a lot of NFL guys, and there will definitely be an 
adjustment period for me in the pros, but I think I can make that transition 
when the time comes." 
</P>
<P>
 That time will be next spring, when Stenstrom learns if he truly is ready for 
the NFL or has merely been a product of Walsh's successful offensive system. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Stenstrom, who is only 6 feet 1, be the second coming of Joe Montana, or 
is he too small and too slow to become anything more than a guy holding a 
clipboard on the sidelines? 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the best quarterback in college football," Walsh said. "And I qualify 
that by saying there are some outstanding quarterbacks in the Pac-10. But I 
believe Steve is the best. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is further along than two out of three NFL quarterbacks in technique, 
mechanics, and in the decision-making process. It's not hard to note that as 
you watch the NFL games." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Green, now coach of the Minnesota Vikings, recruited Stenstrom to 
Stanford in 1990. But it has been Walsh's coaching that has developed Stenstrom 
into a Heisman Trophy contender. 
</P>
<P>
 A redshirt senior and a three-year starter, Stenstrom already has broken four 
Pac-10 passing records and is on track to break some of John Elway's career 
school records. 
</P>
<P>
 Stenstrom had one of the best seasons in conference history last year, when he 
completed 300 of 455 passes (65.9%) for 3,627 yards with 27 touchdowns and 14 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on that, Walsh says Stenstrom could be the next in a long line of 
Cardinal quarterbacks to be drafted in the first round: Elway in 1983 
(Baltimore Colts), Jim Plunkett in 1971 (New England), John Brodie in 1957 (San 
Francisco), Bobby Garrett in 1954 (Cleveland) and Frankie Albert in 1942 
(Chicago Bears). 
</P>
<P>
 Stenstrom's play last season impressed former Washington Redskin Coach Joe 
Gibbs, who attended Cardinal games to watch his son, Coy, a linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two things I always want with a quarterback -- mental toughness and 
smarts," said Gibbs, who won three Super Bowls with different quarterbacks -- 
Joe Theismann, Doug Williams and Mark Rypien. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put those assets before arm strength, everything else. And Steve definitely 
has the mental toughness and smarts you want. He will be the guy the experts 
will be analyzing this year, trying to see if he can play at the next level. He 
has a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 So what do the scouts and analysts think? Not all of them agree that Stenstrom 
is a lock as a first-round pick, even with expansion teams Charlotte and 
Jacksonville in the hunt for young quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," said Joel Buchsbaum, draft analyst for Pro Football Weekly. "Right now, 
Stenstrom is in the middle rounds, the fourth or fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's really smart, very well coached and makes excellent decisions in a great 
system. And there's no questioning his courage and toughness -- he has taken 
some unbelievable hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he's a small kid, doesn't have a strong arm, and he isn't very mobile. 
And after four years playing in a great system, you wonder how much better he 
can get. Is there any way he can improve in the pros, or is he another Steve 
Dils or Guy Benjamin?" 
</P>
<P>
 John Becker, director of player personnel with the Rams, has watched videotape 
of Stenstrom but plans to take a closer look this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know he's from a hell of a program, and mechanically he's way ahead of 
everyone else," Becker said. "And he's been a damn productive guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be a lot of people looking at him (going into the draft). We have 
him down as a guy we'll take a hard look at, but that's nothing unique. 
Twenty-seven other teams are doing the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Stenstrom explored the possibility of turning pro after his junior season. 
Although it was a relatively weak draft for quarterbacks beyond the top two 
prospects -- Tennessee's Heath Shuler and Fresno State's Trent Dilfer -- 
scouts, coaches and analysts told Stenstrom he would go anywhere from the 
middle to late in the first round to not being drafted at all. 
</P>
<P>
 That was more than enough to persuade Stenstrom to return for his senior 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was never much of a thought for me," he said. "I looked into it briefly 
after the season because I felt I owed it to myself to at least explore what 
all these people were talking about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved being at Stanford too much, and I wasn't ready to leave yet. I have 
some goals I still want to accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
 Stenstrom admits he needs some work on his scrambling and running before he's 
ready for the NFL. He has a tendency to look for a third or even a fourth 
receiver when his primary targets aren't open -- a risky move even with a 
competent offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mobility hasn't been a problem (for) me," he said. "It's tucking the ball 
under my arm and running with it when nobody's open. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working on me becoming more of a threat to run the ball instead of 
being purely a passer. I've always known I could do it, but it just hasn't been 
part of my thought process." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh hopes to change that. 
</P>
<P>
 "He needs to move outside the pocket a little better and run it two or three 
times a game, get five or six yards a time, and get a couple first downs," 
Walsh said. "If he does that, the only (detriment) for him as a pro is his 
size." 
</P>
<P>
 Stenstrom is more than two inches shorter than the average height of last 
year's NFL starting quarterbacks. In fact, the shortest quarterback was 
part-time starter Erik Kramer, then with Detroit, at 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Size is really the only major factor for Steve," Walsh said. "Montana is 6 
feet 2, and Steve's an inch shorter. But Joe is very mobile, and Steve doesn't 
possess that." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gibbs: "I was working with all those guys (pro quarterbacks) at the 
Quarterback Challenge a few weeks ago, and all of them were humongous. You need 
to be big to play quarterback at that level." 
</P>
<P>
 But first, Stenstrom must measure up with this year's group of college 
quarterbacks, which includes USC's Rob Johnson, his former El Toro High 
teammate, Alcorn State's Steve McNair, Georgia's Eric Zeier and California's 
Dave Barr. 
</P>
<P>
 Timing could prove to be their downfall when they enter the draft next spring. 
Because of the league's new $34.6-million salary cap, teams can't spend a 
high-round pick -- and the corresponding salary -- on a quarterback they want 
to develop. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, many draft analysts projected Boston College's Glenn Foley and 
Michigan State's Jim Miller as late first-round to second-round picks last 
April. Buffalo liked Foley as a potential successor to Jim Kelly, and the Rams 
raved about the skills of Miller, whom they wanted as a backup for free-agent 
acquisition Chris Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 But on draft day, Jim Miller was taken in the sixth round by Pittsburgh, and 
Foley slipped all the way to the seventh round, where the New York Jets took 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, after Tampa Bay took Trent Dilfer with the sixth overall pick, 104 
players were drafted before the next quarterback (Perry Klein of C.W. Post to 
the Atlanta Falcons in the fourth round) was picked. Only nine quarterbacks 
were selected in the seven-round draft, seven after the third round. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on where Foley went in the draft, Buchsbaum believes Stenstrom wouldn't 
have been taken last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve could really drop to the late rounds this year, too," Buchsbaum said. 
"Foley and Miller had first-round grades last year, but they dropped to the 
sixth and seventh rounds because of the new system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teams just can't expect to bring guys in and let them develop any more with 
that system. Some guys you need to bring in and give three or four years. Look 
at Montana, he wasn't a starter until his (second) season." 
</P>
<P>
 Stenstrom, who watches game film like it was HBO, has studied Montana's every 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never reach a point where you run out of things to improve on," Stenstrom 
said. "All I have to do is pop in a Montana tape and I realize that. 
</P>
<P>
 "He and I have the same physical qualities, and he played in this offense with 
San Francisco, so he's an ideal guy to compare to." 
</P>
<P>
 Stenstrom has been a proven winner, leading the Cardinal to a 21-11 record in 
nearly three seasons as a starter. As for Montana, the 38-year-old quarterback 
is trying to win his fifth Super Bowl ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I admire about Montana," Stenstrom said. "He's not the most 
impressive physical specimen you've ever seen, but he has the unique ability to 
win, that competitive edge and (he) stays poised under pressure. 
</P>

WITH COMEBACK, TIGER PUTS U.S. TITLE IN TANK; GOLF: WOODS, 18, MAKES UP 
SIX-HOLE DEFICIT AND BECOMES YOUNGEST TO WIN NATIONAL AMATEUR CHAMPIONSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Caution wasn't a consideration as Tiger Woods of Cypress stepped to the 17th 
tee Sunday afternoon with the 94th U.S. Amateur on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 The pin on the Stadium Course's island green was tucked back-right, a Sunday 
pin placement from which the most seasoned professionals have shied during the 
Players Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 But Woods, with 18-year-old nerves, took dead aim at the pin and the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 In his bid to become the youngest champion in tournament history, Woods 
already had made up a six-hole deficit in the 36-hole final against Trip Kuehne 
of McKinney, Tex., with some brilliant shot-making, finally drawing even on the 
34th hole with a birdie. This wasn't the time to back off. 
</P>
<P>
 Choosing a wedge for his tee shot from 139 yards, he hit a high soft cut that 
hung delicately in the quartering right-to-left wind. The ball one-hopped the 
sliver of land between the pin and bulkhead and clung to the fringe -- two feet 
from the water and 14 feet from the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods then drained the right-to-left putt for birdie, taking his first lead of 
the day. One last par at 18 to Kuehne's bogey finalized Woods' historic 2-up 
victory, also believed to be the largest comeback in U.S. Amateur history. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even Jack Nicklaus was able to win this event at 18. The Golden Bear had 
to wait until he was 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods earns spots in the 1995 U.S. and British Opens to go with his Masters 
invitation that he earned as a finalist. 
</P>
<P>
 "This feels great," he said. "I had to play some of the best golf of my 
career. Being the youngest champion hasn't set in yet. It's a weird feeling to 
win like this. The only time I felt I had won was when I hugged my father (on 
the 18th green)." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those watching in Orange County was Don Crosby, who coaches the Western 
High School team that Woods has played with for the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was that exciting or what?" Crosby said. "It was nerve-wracking. I felt that 
if he was in a 36-hole final, there aren't too many people that could beat him 
the way he is playing right now. It was a quite a thrill." 
</P>
<P>
 Woods battled back from a 5-hole afternoon deficit by playing the last 12 
holes four under par. From holes 7 through 11, Woods trimmed Kuehne's lead by 
four to 1-up with two birdies to two Kuehne bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
 And looking back to the morning round, he was 6-down through 13 holes and 
4-down through 18, thanks to Kuehne's brilliant 6-under 66. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to keep positive," said Woods, now 19-1 in match play this summer. 
"When I won the 9th hole (in the afternoon round with a par) to get to 3-down, 
I figured I had a shot if I shot three or four under on the back." 
</P>
<P>
 He shot three under, completing an afternoon round of 68 to Kuehne's 74. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel best about coming back from 6-down and hanging in there," said Woods, 
who graduated from Western in June and will attend Stanford this fall. "I knew 
I could if I got into a groove. I just needed to dig deep and do it." 
</P>
<P>
 With the victory, Woods becomes the first player in history to win 
championships in the U.S. Junior Amateur and U.S. Amateur and the third to win 
a U.S. Golf Assn. title four consecutive years, joining Bobby Jones and Carolyn 
Cudone. This follows his three consecutive Junior Amateur titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehne, meanwhile, was left to reflect on the enormous disappointment of 
letting the prestigious title slip away. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you can ask for is an opportunity, and I had one," said Kuehne, 22, an 
Oklahoma State junior in a wavering voice. "I played super golf. It's hard to 
put into words how proud I am of myself and how disappointed I am that I did 
not come out on top. I had ample opportunities, but Tiger displayed why he is 
the champion he is with his recovery shots to keep the pressure on." 
</P>
<P>
 It took remarkable skill and, in spots, remarkable luck for Woods to overcome 
Kuehne. Living up to his name, Tiger played out of the woods a number of times 
Sunday. He hit only 13 of 28 fairways and missed six of seven at one stretch 
before hitting the 18th with a two-iron. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've grown up in the trees," Woods joked. "I've been so wild for so long. I 
play out of them all the damn time. When you're able to scramble, that drains 
an opponent. I had to put pressure on him, because a good player isn't going to 
give you anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehne tipped his hat to the shots Woods made. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you hit into the trees, you've got to be lucky to have a shot," Kuehne 
said. "If you have the shot, you need the skill to make the shot. The kid shot 
a lotta, lotta, lotta golf game today getting out of those situations to get to 
the green and cash in." 
</P>
<P>
 Western High teammate Bryon Bell, who has caddied for Woods in two tournaments 
this summer and was watching on television this time, could appreciate the 
combination of luck and guts Woods showed on No. 17, when he went for the pin 
and narrowly avoided the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a little lucky but he showed courage in going for the pin," Bell said. 
"He had to make a birdie. Even if he didn't win it still would have showed what 
a good player he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Another player pulling for Woods from home was Saddleback College golf Coach 
Bill Cunerty, who was two groups behind Woods at the U.S. Amateur qualifying 
tournament earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an awfully polished young man," Cunerty said. "He has an incredible 
imagination. Halfway through the round today, his name should have been 'In the 
Woods'. He hit some bad shots, but if there was a window he found it and a way 
to get the ball on the green. He makes the game look easier than it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't make pars and beat him. In match play his standard is birdie. He's 
as normal as a guy can be who is probably the best 18-year-old player in the 
world."

RAMS RELEASE HENLEY, MIGHT RE-SIGN HIM; PRO FOOTBALL: TEAM WOULD CONSIDER 
ADDING CORNERBACK LATER SHOULD HIS BAIL RESTRICTIONS LESSEN. RUNNING BACK GARY 
ALSO LET GO ALONG WITH FOUR OTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Less than a month after inviting controversy with the signing of indicted 
cornerback Darryl Henley, the Rams concluded Sunday they would be better off 
without him -- for now. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams released Henley on the mandatory cut to 53 players along with running 
back Cleveland Gary and four others, but behind the scenes the team indicated 
it might reconsider adding him to the roster should his bail restrictions 
become less stringent. 
</P>
<P>
 The team said it would not be surprised if Henley petitioned the court for 
leniency, but also expressed doubt that changes would be granted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big blow," Henley said. "I find it hard to believe it had anything to 
do with my performance on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, we're not finished talking about this yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, who started 41 games for the Rams, suffered a hamstring injury in 
practice last week. If healthy, he would be considered one of the team's top 
cornerbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a personnel decision basically," Coach Chuck Knox said. "We had some 
guys in the secondary that could help us on special teams and Darryl missed a 
lot of training camp. That was the basic reason." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the reason given publicly, but it's known team officials felt the new 
bail restrictions imposed upon Henley presented an intolerable distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Court Judge Gary L. Taylor, reacting to Henley's request to 
travel to Ram games on the road, increased his bail from $200,000 to $1 
million, and ordered a probation officer to be at Henley's side at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor ruled that Henley's $1-million bail could be raised by a "responsible" 
third party, such as the Rams. The team informed Henley that it probably would 
be willing to put up the money, but it did not like the idea of having a 
probation officer on the team flight, in the team hotel and in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to talk about the other thing," Knox said when asked if 
potential distractions had prompted Henley's release. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox spoke with Henley on Saturday and told him he intended to cut him, but 
waited to make it official Sunday in the event there was any possibility of 
trading him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coach has the final say on the selection of the team," said John Shaw, 
Ram president. "He made the final decision on it. We support what he does." 
</P>
<P>
 Safety Anthony Newman, who had expressed enthusiasm upon Henley's return, was 
surprised to learn the team had released him. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a friend's standpoint, I'm going to miss him," Newman said. "I know he's 
a player, but with all the stuff going on, coaches and management felt we 
needed to move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Henley was the team's starting cornerback last year before running into legal 
trouble. He took a leave of absence, and then was indicted along with a former 
Ram cheerleader and three others as participants in an alleged conspiracy to 
transfer two shipments of cocaine from his Brea home to locations in Atlanta 
and Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 The cheerleader, Tracy Ann Donaho, has pleaded guilty and is expected to 
testify against Henley and the other defendants. Henley has maintained his 
innocence, and is scheduled to go to trial in January. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Henley, the Rams released Gary, starting left guard Bill 
Schultz, safety Deral Boykin, defensive tackle Marc Boutte and tight end Rickey 
Brady. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas Coach Barry Switzer expressed interest in Gary, who ran for 1,125 yards 
two years ago, as a backup to Emmitt Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary, who was scheduled to earn $500,000, became a victim, in part, of 
economics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that we could have two backs there (for the same money) was a 
factor," said Knox, who chose to keep Howard Griffith and rookie James Bostic 
to back up Jerome Bettis. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary said he was bewildered by the team's action, but declined to criticize 
the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not bitter with anybody," said Gary, who didn't count out the possibility 
of playing with the Raiders. "I want to win. I think I can make an impact 
somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 While Gary was surprised at being released, Schultz was stunned. Two weeks ago 
the Rams made Schultz their starting left guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was locked in, things were going good, and I rented a condo," Schultz said. 
"Paid five months up front -- that's $10,000 gone. One of the stipulations was 
that it was non-refundable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just never thought. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams greeted Schultz on Sunday morning with news that Knox wanted to see 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a joke and laughed," Schultz said. "They said, 'Bill, it's 
no joke.' "

 Caution wasn't a consideration as Tiger Woods of Cypress stepped to the 17th 
tee Sunday with the 94th U.S. Amateur golf championship on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 The pin on the Stadium Course's island green was to the back right, a Sunday

four to 1-up with two birdies to two Kuehne bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
 And looking back to the morning round, he was 6-down through 13 holes and 
4-down through 18, thanks to Kuehne's brilliant six-under 66. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to keep positive," said Woods, who is 19-1 in match play this 
summer. "When I won the ninth hole (with a par in the afternoon round) to get 
to 3-down, I figured I had a shot if I shot three or four under on the back." 
</P>
<P>
 He shot three under, completing an afternoon round of 68 to Kuehne's 74. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel best about coming back from 6-down and hanging in there," Woods said. 
"I knew I could if I got into a groove. I just needed to dig deep and do it." 
</P>
<P>
 With the victory, Woods becomes the first player in history to win both the 
U.S. Junior and Amateur championships and the third golfer to win a U.S. Golf 
Assn. title four consecutive years, joining Bobby Jones and Carolyn Cudone. 
This follows his three consecutive Junior Amateur titles.  
</P>
<P>
 Woods, who is going to Stanford this fall, earned spots in the 1995 U.S. and 
British opens to go with the Masters invitation that he earned as a finalist. 
</P>
<P>
 "This feels great," Woods said. "I had to play some of the best golf of my 
career. Being the youngest champion hasn't set in yet. It's a weird feeling to 
win like this. The only time I felt I had won was when I hugged my father (on

lotta, lotta, lotta golf game today getting out of those situations to get to 
the green and cash in." 
</P>
<P>
 In the morning, Kuehne was nothing short of brilliant. In shooting a 66, he 
played the first 13 holes seven-under par with none of his seven birdie putts 
longer than four feet. He hit 11 fairways and 14 greens, plus was on the fringe 
of two other greens.  
</P>
<P>
 Woods, meanwhile, saw his normally reliable putting hurt him in the morning. 
He lipped out three short birdie putts -- of three feet on No. 11, four on 13 
and nine on 17.

HIS GOLDEN SUMMER WAS TURNED TO BRASS; GAMBLING: THE LEGEND WAS ON A ROLL UNTIL 
THE BASEBALL STRIKE OF 1981 BEGAN. HIS MIDAS TOUCH THEN PROVED ELUSIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 He piled on cash of epic amounts, betting beyond even his comprehension or 
anyone's for that matter; but then, who can explain wagering more than a 
million dollars on an All-Star game? 
</P>
<P>
 With the baseball strike of 1981 over, having lasted 10 weeks that summer, The 
Legend had resurfaced in Las Vegas, believing that the whole weird season was 
some kind of omen for him to bet the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought, this is the time to take a real shot, the strike is over, we 
will see which side I'm on, whether I should continue gambling or give it up," 
said The Legend, who, for obvious reasons, prefers that his name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, I used that game as a litmus test." 
</P>
<P>
 The summer of 1981, like now, was a time without baseball. In both cases, 
labor strife had shut down the game and those who bet major league baseball. 
One such person was The Legend, whose exploits that season in the Las Vegas 
sports books did not go unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legend had been up $1.5 million during the 1981 season when the players 
went on strike. He started with a $10,000 bet, a parlay of four underdogs that 
he figured couldn't lose, and won $280,000. From that point, nobody quite did 
it like he did. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent about four hours each day charting teams and players on a legal pad 
and, until the strike, neglecting his regular job. Then, with either Juice 
Newton or REO Speedwagon cranked up in his headset, he would head for the 
casinos with thousands in cash stuffed into his knapsack or briefcase or both. 
The unusual thing was that he always came home with more. 
</P>
<P>
 He won about 75 of 100 games betting mainly on underdogs, studying teams and 
statistics so intently he felt he knew players better than their managers. He 
knew which pitchers were successful against which teams, which lineups worked 
well, and he never bet against a streak -- he bet with it. It was the first 
time -- and only time -- in The Legends' life that he gambled this way, and he 
found success had nothing to do with instinct or luck, but with strict 
methodology. 
</P>
<P>
 On the final game before the players walked out in mid-June, The Legend won 
$500,000, which proved to be his final triumph. The day after the strike, he 
flew to Las Vegas, cashed in $1.5 million in tickets, and flew home accompanied 
by a security guard, cash bulging from his clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way I was hoping the strike would go on at some level because I was 
getting into my work again and I thought, 'I'm out of the rhythm, it's not 
going to be the same,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt the strike was an interruption of my guaranteed wins, I felt I was on 
a permanent roll that year, that I would just keep going and going and I still 
feel it. I had the season psyched. Then in one day of baseball and three days 
of football, all the money went, but most of it in that one day." 
</P>
<P>
 The All-Star Game was played on Aug. 9, and was the first game after the 
strike. The Legend took his cash from a vault and flew back to Las Vegas, 
piling up bets all over town. He bet more than $1 million on the American 
League, which had lost nine games in a row. He was betting against a streak, 
contrary to the method he had employed all season. But his thinking was that 
the American League was the underdog, and he believed it had a better lineup. 
His only hesitation was betting on a team managed by Jim Frey, then of the 
Kansas City Royals, because he "loathed" him. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I figured that the All-Star Game is one of those games that everybody 
gets in anyway, so the manager really didn't matter," he said. "I did feel a 
bit of a twinge about making any bet on Jim Frey ever, but I thought it was a 
great bet. Then, it hit me as an afterthought.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm watching the game, which I had bet an astronomical amount on, and some of 
the players were in shape and some out of shape. Rollie Fingers had announced 
he was pudgy, fat, out of shape, had not thrown a pitch the whole time (of the 
strike) and announced that he was not ready to pitch and didn't want to pitch. 
To this day, I believe Jim Frey wanted to use him to see if he could hurt his 
arm because the (Oakland) A's were competitive with the (Kansas City) Royals. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'm ahead, like 4-2 and I'm sort of in this euphoria because I'm going to 
win this huge bet and all of a sudden I get a flash in my mind that Jim Frey is 
going to bring in Rollie Fingers to hurt his arm. And Fingers is going to say 
forget this, 'I'm not going to throw a pitch and if I get clubbed I get 
clubbed.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's exactly what happened. I get the flash in the seventh inning and 
Rollie Fingers came in in the eighth inning and he was like a batting practice 
pitcher. He literally lobbed the ball in pitch after pitch and they beat the 
hell out of him, scored three runs in about 45 seconds and I lost the game, 
5-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "To this day, I have fantasies of tomahawking Jim Frey. I don't blame Rollie 
Fingers, he had announced that he didn't want to pitch and wasn't in shape. 
There were some players who had been assuming the strike was going to end and 
they had been keeping in shape, but there were others who were assuming they 
had eight months off, and he was one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Legend returned home, having more than a quarter of a million left, and he 
put it back in the vault. His work took him out of the country, and when he 
returned, the playoffs were starting. He considered it another omen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I borrowed so I could bet more than I had -- I don't remember what my unit 
(usual bet) was," he said. "I also had (football) parlays hooked up -- I just 
didn't bet them straight. I had two-team, three-team, four-team, five-team and 
a six-team parlay with these six games and I won one straight bet, that was it. 
I had about 20 combinations and I won one single bet. And I just said, this is 
my run. I had my shot and this was it.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had that fantasy, just for that baseball season, of playing on the level of 
the big guys. But those other guys started by accumulating their wealth in 
other areas and then gambling became excitement and a shrewd investment on the 
side. They wouldn't do it for just any game." 
</P>
<P>
 Having started with $10,000, The Legend ended the season $25,000 behind, owing 
it to a man who hounded him for it. Since then, The Legend says he has only bet 
sporadically, and says he has no inclination to ever go wild again.  
</P>
<P>
 "The weirdest thing is that it took me a long time to pay off the $25,000 and 
I thought, 'This is crazy, here I had all this money and now I'm spending six 
months paying off $1,500 this week, $2,000 next week,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I borrowed it from a guy who was not charging me interest but was on my case 
because I told him I would have it back to him in a week or two, and then I had 
to tell him I was totally wiped out and it would take a while to get it back. 
And he said, 'What do you mean, a while?'  
</P>
<P>
 "The absurdity of paying off a $25,000 bet over a period of months when 
$25,000 was money I wouldn't have noticed if it had fallen out of my pocket. 
This was like almost overnight. It was like, all of a sudden, a total 
transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I gamble now, I look to turn $25,000 or $30,000, that would be a score 
for me. I earn good money, and if I lose $10,000 or $15,000 I say 'Oh, (well).' 
But the idea of again starting with a reasonable amount of money and turning it 
into some huge sum isn't part of some realistic thinking. It isn't even part of 
a fantasy anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 His adrenaline rush, though, wasn't fantasy. It didn't take long for The 
Legend to develop a following in Las Vegas and across the nation. He rarely 
lost, and he soon dictated the baseball line all over the country. He did most 
of his betting at the Barbary Coast, cranking up his Walkman -- a rare 
accessory in 1981 -- to tune out distractions so he could concentrate. He 
sometimes bet $200,000 on an individual game, and overall bet up to $1 million 
per day. He would play blackjack until the baseball games were over, keeping an 
eye on the sports book for results. Then he would fly home -- he rarely stayed 
overnight -- with a briefcase full of cash, only to return the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are guys that bet between $500 and $2 million a game, they are there, 
but nobody talks about it," he said. "I was considered a big player by the 
standards of the rinky-dink players, but I was a non-existent player by the 
standards of the guys with real money. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys are not going to do it the way I did, they are going to make one 
phone call. I did it with cash, theirs becomes cash, but it becomes cash 
quietly and secretly. It was the flamboyancy of the way I did it, not the 
amount." 
</P>
<P>
 The Legend says he follows sports only mildly now, saying he doesn't even know 
the names of half the players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to know everything and thought I knew more than a manager or a coach 
in every sport I was following," he said. "Particularly in baseball, I went 
beyond just knowledge -- I went into these really precise chartings and 
analysis. Anything you figure out that way and learn and know how to do, is 
exciting, because you are better at it than anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now, I wouldn't give a (rip) . . . even if it worked, who cares? It was 
there for that one baseball season. It was never there before or after. And I 
was conscious of it."

SAMPRAS RESURFACES, AND HE'S READY TO GO; U.S. OPEN: DEFENDING CHAMPION APPEARS 
SHARP IN PRACTICE SESSION WITH EDBERG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a Pete Sampras sighting Sunday. Turns out he is alive and well and 
about 99% ready to defend his U.S. Open tennis title the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras is the No. 1-ranked men's player in the world, winner of four of the 
last five Grand Slam events. He is currently so much better than the rest of 
the men's field that no less than Boris Becker said recently, with only partial 
tongue in cheek, that his goal and that of most of the other top men right now 
is to "try to bother Pete a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras, after winning his second consecutive Wimbledon title this summer and 
limping through a Davis Cup match July 17, disappeared from the tennis scene. 
He canceled out of tournaments in Washington, Toronto, Cincinnati and 
Indianapolis -- the traditional summer hardcourt tuneup events for the Open -- 
and even pulled out of the doubles competition last Tuesday at a tournament 
called the Hamlet Cup in Commack, N.Y., where he had been scheduled to play 
with Richey Reneberg. 
</P>
<P>
 The culprit was a pair of new shoes that caused a sore left ankle, at first 
diagnosed as tendinitis and, more recently, as calcium deposits on a ligament. 
This was no injury of convenience to get out of tournament commitments; nor was 
it one of those soccer injuries where the weeping and drama far outstrip the 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
 His coach, Tim Gullikson, said Sunday morning, "When Pete pulled out of the 
doubles last Tuesday, he did so because he just couldn't have played. The 
doctor said he couldn't go, that he still needed more rest." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what made Sunday morning's Sampras sighting so significant. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 10:45 a.m. on Center Court at the U.S. Tennis Center in Flushing 
Meadow. Sampras was playing practice games with Stefan Edberg, the only man 
other than Sampras to win the U.S. Open in the 1990s -- Sampras won in 1990 and 
'93, Edberg in '91 and '92. People pay hundreds of dollars to see these two 
play. But since this practice session wasn't a scheduled event, the crowd was 
46. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who watched closely saw the Sampras of old. The serve crackled, the 
movements were fluid, the timing sharp. The two superstars played for more than 
1 1/2 hours and, had anybody been keeping score, Sampras would have won. What 
really counted, though, was how Sampras' heavily taped left ankle fared. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's OK, not too bad," Sampras said. "I felt good out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Gullikson agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure it is a little tender, and I'm sure it is going to be," he said. 
"But he moved pretty good out there today, even though he is probably still 
holding back a little. I'm confident it is going to be A-OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Gullikson, who took over as Sampras' coach in 1992, when Sampras was ranked 
No. 6, said he is stepping up the intensity and frequency of the practice 
sessions. Sampras plays 22-year-old South African qualifier Kevin Ullyett in 
the first round, but it hadn't been determined as of Sunday morning whether 
that match will be Tuesday or Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm watching that closely, so that we can ease back a bit the day before he 
plays," said Gullikson, who added that Sampras had also practiced hard the day 
before against qualifier Wade McGuire, a friend from the Tampa area and more of 
a baseliner than Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want him to get comfortable for any kind of game, but mostly I'm doing what 
I've always done with Pete -- keep it simple. I want his mind uncluttered when 
he goes out there. I want him at such a high level, as he has been the last 
year and a half or two years, that the other guys have to adjust to him, rather 
than him adjusting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete playing at his best is like the old Green Bay Packers. They were going 
to run the power sweep, you knew they were going to run it, and it was up to 
you to stop it." 
</P>
<P>
 Steffi Graf, seeded No. 1 among the women, has also been bothered by an injury 
that, like Sampras', is expected to be sufficiently healed to allow her to be 
the likely winner. Graf, who won U.S. Open titles in 1988, '89 and '93, will 
test her sore back in a first-round match Tuesday or Wednesday against 
wild-card entry Ann Mall of La Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-seeded players each have a match on opening day today. Goran 
Ivanisevic of Croatia will play on the Grandstand court against Markus Zoecke 
of Germany, and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain will take on Linda Ferrando of 
Italy in the opener on Center Court. Although both matches should easily follow 
form, Ferrando is best known for ousting Monica Seles in the 1990 U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more interesting story lines in this year's event will be in women's 
doubles, in which Natalie Zvereva and Gigi Fernandez will attempt to complete 
the doubles Grand Slam that eluded them a year ago. Last year, they won the 
Australian, French and Wimbledon titles before going out in the U.S. Open 
semifinals to Sanchez Vicario and Helena Sukova. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Zvereva suffered a stress fracture in her ribs just prior to the 
women's event at La Costa the first week in August. She pulled out of that 
tournament, and also the women's event at Manhattan Beach. The injury remains 
serious enough for her to also have pulled out of the singles here, but she 
will play doubles in her quest for the Slam, something that hasn't been 
achieved in women's doubles since Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver did it in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
 In men's doubles, last year's winners, Ken Flach and Rick Leach, both U.S. 
Davis Cup veterans, have split up. Flach will play with his brother, Doug, and 
Leach with South African Danie Visser. Neither team is seeded. Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 John McEnroe avenged his defeat of a year ago in the third annual Arthur Ashe 
AIDS Tennis Challenge, beating Andre Agassi on Sunday in a 9-7 tiebreaker that 
featured the normal clowning for a national television audience. The highlights 
were Agassi's 117-m.p.h. serve aimed at McEnroe's head that barely missed and 
chair umpire Bill Cosby's obvious bias toward the older McEnroe. A crowd of 
15,763, most of whom paid $12 each, helped to further contribute to the Ashe 
AIDS Foundation, which has raised more than $4 million in three years. . . . 
The men's and women's U.S. Open singles champions will each receive $550,000, 
an increase of $15,000 from last year. . . . The U.S. Tennis Assn. will honor 
the 25th anniversary year of Rod Laver's 1969 Grand Slam sweep with a Rod Laver 
Day here Sept. 7. Laver, a resident of Rancho Mirage, won $16,000 the last time 
he won the U.S. Open in '69. . . . Meilen Tu, 16, of Northridge will make her 
U.S. Open debut today, playing the first match on Court 12 against Silvia 
Farina, a 22-year-old from Italy. Tu got a berth by winning the USTA Junior 
title this year. . . . Gabriela Sabatini, who won the U.S. Open in 1990, has 
become pretty much of a non-factor on the tour and is seeded eighth. . . . Amy 
Frazier, who went through the L.A. Slims tournament without losing a set, is 
seeded 16th. . . . As in past years, the USA cable network will handle U.S. 
Open telecasts when CBS is not. USA will carry 86 1/2 hours of the event, 
starting this morning and going right through the event's final day, when it 
will show the women's doubles final. USA's main commentators will be John 
McEnroe, Tracy Austin, Virginia Wade and Barry McKay. . . . CBS will handle 39 
hours of the prime matches, with telecasts the first weekend through Labor Day 
and Saturday and Sunday of the final weekend. Announcers include Jim Nantz, 
Mary Carillo, Tim Ryan and Tony Trabert.

MIKE DOWNEY: IT'S TIME FOR PLAYERS TO RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The time has come for the professional baseball players of America to go back 
to work. To be magnanimous. To give the pastime back to the people. To make 
everyone appreciate them for doing something totally unselfish. To stop playing 
hardball and start playing baseball.  
</P>
<P>
 With one solitary gesture, sympathy in this country would turn overnight. 
Popularity of the players in polls would soar like a President's after winning 
a war. All the athletes have to do is make an announcement that they are 
returning to play, right now, today, with negotiations with the owners resuming 
as soon as the season ends. Then, if there is no progress by April, they can 
stay away. 
</P>
<P>
 That's all it would take -- one concession. With a single stroke, resentment 
toward the players would ebb and the greed-is-good stigma of their work 
stoppage would be gone. Rather than having Brett Butler reminding the public 
how much fun the players will be having on the golf course unless the owners 
yield in the salary-cap impasse, player reps could proudly proclaim that they 
can't stand one more minute of denying Americans what they want, so shucks, 
everybody play ball.  
</P>
<P>
 That's all. All they do is tell Donald Fehr (or he tells them) to tell Richard 
Ravitch to keep his November and December free. When winter comes, the two of 
them can be locked inside a hotel ballroom and thrash it out until the morning 
coffee turns to tar. The owners can send in their 12-man musical-chair 
committee to kibitz whenever they like.  
</P>
<P>
 Everybody has made his point. Fehr and Ravitch have been very firm and have 
achieved virtual solidarity among their respective tribes. Bill Clinton has 
said that he misses baseball almost as much as he would miss Razorback 
basketball and a federal mediator has acknowledged that both sides made 
excellent presentations, now when's lunch? If only Clinton and Fidel Castro 
could come to terms, the Dodgers and Yankees could field nine new players 
apiece from Havana tomorrow and quality wouldn't diminish one iota.  
</P>
<P>
 But fanciful notions solve nothing. Nor do "petitions" signed by fans that 
they will never attend another game, because fans have been pulling such stunts 
for years. All the athletes and owners ever do is go yeah, yeah, yeah, we feel 
terrible about this ourselves. But nobody is ever going to organize a fan 
boycott obeyed by 240 million Americans and a few million tourists, so give it 
a rest.  
</P>
<P>
 Only the players can end this thing instantaneously. If the player reps stood 
up tomorrow, said they weren't breaking on this salary cap but were agreeing 
for a few weeks to bend, they would hear standing ovations from coast to coast. 
Customers would feel their dollars were going toward people who actually cared 
about them. Yes, the players do mean business, but wasn't it nice of them to 
give us our games back? 
</P>
<P>
 No one will propose such a thing in New York this week, naturally. Money talks 
and bull takes a base on balls. When owner Jerry Reinsdorf asked what it would 
take, said c'mon, tell us what you want, labor leader Fehr volleyed: "Jerry, 
how much profit do you want?" The gimme-gimme nature of these negotiations is 
going to drag on until the bosses find some face-saving gesture, because the 
workers simply won't budge.  
</P>
<P>
 The strikers aren't going sleepless on picket lines and wondering how they 
will feed their families. They aren't manning a barricade like soldiers in "Les 
Miserables." They are out playing golf. They can weather this storm for a year, 
maybe two. There are .220-hitting shortstops with more substantial assets than 
entire savings-and-loan associations. The players won't return until the owners 
say: "Whatever you want." 
</P>
<P>
 Just never forget that the players were the ones who took baseball away from 
you.  
</P>
<P>
 They could have refused to report in 1995 instead, but no. They ducked out on 
the American public in mid-excitement and took their bats and balls with them. 
No matter how unsympathetic you are to mega-wealthy overlords who pay the help, 
remember that the ballplayers were the pilots who left the cockpit of your Los 
Angeles-to-New York flight while you were connecting in Denver. You didn't get 
canceled. You got stranded.  
</P>
<P>
 The players made it a point -- a deliberate choice -- to inconvenience the 
fan. They could act heroically tomorrow and make a game-saving catch. A billion 
bucks says they won't.

BEACH VOLLEYBALL; CELEBRATION CUT SHORT FOR KIRALY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The $250,000 Miller Lite Championships in Hermosa Beach were marred by a freak 
accident shortly after the final between the top-seeded team of Karch Kiraly 
and Kent Steffes and fourth-seeded Eduardo Bacil and Jose Loiola. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning the match, 11-7, Kiraly and Steffes took the stage to deliver 
speeches and receive trophies. As Kiraly stepped back to switch places with his 
partner and take the microphone, he fell through about a two-foot gap in the 
stage's rear. 
</P>
<P>
 He plunged about six feet to the ground and hit a steel beam that supports the 
structure with his back. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiraly never lost consciousness, but was taken to South Bay Hospital in 
Redondo Beach on a stretcher with a plastic cervical collar in place. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I was in amazement and total shock," Steffes said. "It was the 
strangest thing that has happened on this tour. All I could do was stand there 
with my mouth open." 
</P>
<P>
 Steffes, who was at his partner's side immediately after the fall, said Kiraly 
was alert and talking. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never hit his head," Steffes said. "He was concerned at first, then a 
litle embarrassed . . . at the end he just wanted to get out of there." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Rathje, the first paramedic to see Kiraly after the fall, said Kiraly 
did not appear to have any serious injuries. "He wanted to get up and move 
around," Rathje said. "He was just very embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Assn. of Volleyball Professionals said preliminary X-rays 
showed no serious injuries, but that further tests would be conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 Announcer Paul Sunderland, who was among those who accompanied Kiraly to the 
hospital, said he was released after about two hours. "He's got some abrasions 
and a sore back but otherwise he's OK," Sunderlund said. "He just called to say 
he is fine, so that's good news." 
</P>
<P>
 A two-time Olympic gold medalist, Kiraly has been on that stage many times. He 
has 94 career beach titles, including the last three season-ending 
championships in Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this season, Kiraly suffered a bruised kidney after hitting a 
court-side banner while diving for a ball.  
</P>
<P>
 He sat out four tournaments and six weeks of training. 
</P>
<P>
 In this weekend's event, however, he was back in top form. Kiraly and Steffes 
will split $100,000 for their victory and Bacil and Loiola will split $22,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't even thought about the tournament for one moment,' Steffes said. 
"The only thing on my mind was Karch. . . . But he should be back dancing at 
our banquet (tonight)."

TOUCHING BACK; PAYAM SAADAT RETURNS TO FOOTBALL AFTER LOSING LEFT HAND IN 
EXPLOSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Thursday, almost 1 1/2 years after losing his left hand in a pipe bomb 
explosion, Payam Saadat will wear uniform No. 44 to honor his deceased teammate 
when Washington State plays Illinois at Chicago's Soldier Field. 
</P>
<P>
 The former St. Monica High standout was injured and his friend and teammate 
Harvey M. (Buddy) Waldron IV killed when a bomb they constructed exploded in 
Waldron's truck in Pullman, Wash., on April 19, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all that I went through, no one gave me a chance to be back on the 
field," said Saadat, 21, who was not charged in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I walk on the field wearing his number, I will be playing for two 
people -- me and the spirit of him inside me." 
</P>
<P>
 Hard work and determination made Saadat and Waldron football players. 
Curiosity and poor judgment cost them dearly. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the accident, they were junior non-scholarship players who rarely saw 
action in varsity games. Saadat played in one varsity game each during his 
sophomore and junior seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were being curious and mischievous," Saadat said. "I'm not going to say, 
'I didn't want to do it.' We were just going to lay it in the wheat field and 
let it go off. We meant no harm." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Saadat and Waldron assembled a bomb at Saadat's apartment using an 
8-inch-long, 1 1/2-inch wide galvanized pipe, filled with gunpowder and wired 
to an alarm clock. They had planned to detonate it in a wheat field outside 
Pullman. 
</P>
<P>
 The bomb had a 30-minute delay and the two planned to watch it explode from 
Saadat's apartment on a hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 Saadat told police that he held the bomb in his lap while Waldron drove his 
1978 utility vehicle. Saadat said they heard a sizzle when Waldron stopped the 
truck in the 300 block of Irving Street about 11:15 p.m. on April 19, 1993, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Saadat checked the wires, the bomb exploded in his lap and the vehicle 
went into motion when Waldron's foot slipped off the brake and onto the 
accelerator, police reports state. 
</P>
<P>
 "The car was never in park," Saadat said. "We ran on top of another (parked) 
car. That's what stopped the vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
 Saadat was taken to Pullman Memorial Hospital and then flown by helicopter to 
Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, where he was treated for 11 days. In 
addition to losing his left hand two inches below the wrist, he suffered burns 
to his left leg, which needed four skin grafts, and nearly lost his right hand, 
a hospital official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Waldron, 22, of Bellevue, Wash., died from head injuries at Sacred Heart 
Medical Center in Spokane, Wash., a day after the explosion, according to the 
Spokane County coroner's office. A piece of shrapnel entered his skull through 
his right eye, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pullman police conducted a joint investigation with the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms. While searching Saadat's apartment, Detective Chris 
Tennant of the Pullman Police Department said another bomb and bomb-making 
materials were discovered. A book called "Poor Man's James Bond" was also 
found. "It was a book on bombs with the page turned to how to make time bombs," 
Tennant said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a one-year investigation, the case was dismissed and no charges were 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Saadat joined Washington State as a non-scholarship player in 1990 after 
playing four seasons at St. Monica High under Coach Angelo Jackson. He was a 
two-year starting offensive guard and captain of the Mariners' 1989 team, which 
won the Santa Fe League championship. He played on the Cougars' junior varsity 
team and appeared in varsity games against Oregon State in 1991 and against 
Temple in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 As a redshirt last season, Saadat took part in winter conditioning. By March, 
he was working out in pads during spring drills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I overcame the biggest thing and that's the mental part of losing my hand," 
Saadat said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saadat, a five-year varsity walk-on, will be a second-string middle linebacker 
used in passing situations and backup on all special teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is an inspiration to the players and the coaches," Washington State 
defensive coordinator Bill Doba said. "What he lacks in athletic ability, he 
makes up with hard work and determination. If he had more speed, he would be a 
starter." 
</P>
<P>
 When Saadat returned to fall practice Aug. 11, he was admired by his teammates 
for showing courage to come back and play. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I drop a ball, defensive players holler at me. They have not excluded me 
because of my handicap, but they also aren't giving me any special favors." 
</P>
<P>
 During a scrimmage, Saadat intercepted a pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're probably the only team in the country to put a kid with one hand in the 
game for passing situations," Doba said. "But he's been around for five seasons 
and he knows our defensive package as well as anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Saadat has trouble talking about the incident and has avoided his St. Monica 
classmates and teachers since he returned home last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pretty much avoided everyone but my family and closest friends when I came 
back to Santa Monica," he said. "I needed time to do my own thing and get my 
life back on track." 
</P>
<P>
 Waldron's parents have helped ease Saadat's guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard, naturally, to see them," said Saadat, who met Waldron's parents 
at their home only four days before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came to see me in the hospital and treated me like they were second 
parents. We still keep in touch." 
</P>
<P>
 Saadat has regained the 30 pounds he lost while recovering in the hospital. 
Using a prosthetic hook on his left arm, Saadat is able to lift weights at 6 
every morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Saadat wears a bullet-shaped shell over his left arm, which is covered by a 
jelly-filled lining and another shell. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know how much you use two hands until you lose one of them," said 
Saadat, who is right-handed. "I struggle with everything from tying my shoes to 
putting on my clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The toughest part is being patient and not get aggravated," he said. "I 
understand now that it takes 10 minutes for me to tie my shoe." 
</P>
<P>
 The one thing that can't be replaced is the loss of his friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buddy and I had a good relationship," Saadat said. "He pushed me and I pushed 
him. When they told me he had died, I felt another piece of me was gone."

JORDAN: HE'S HERO TODAY, GONE TOMORROW; RAIDERS: STAR OF TEAM'S VICTORY OVER 
OILERS IS TRADED TO PACKERS FOR UNDISCLOSED DRAFT CHOICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Charles Jordan knew a wide receiver had to go. 
</P>
<P>
 With Tim Brown, Alexander Wright, James Jett, Rocket Ismail and Daryl Hobbs 
also in contention for the five wide receiver spots, Jordan knew the Raiders' 
final cutdown to 53 players was going to affect one of them. He just didn't 
know who. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday morning, Jordan found out the player was him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hello, Charles?" said George Karros, the Raiders' scouting director, when he 
telephoned Jordan. "You've just been traded to Green Bay. Keep your head up. 
It's a numbers game." 
</P>
<P>
 So in a span of less than 24 hours, Jordan went from a hero whose catch helped 
the Raiders win their final preseason game at Houston to a Packer in need of 
some warm clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not bitter or disappointed because (the Raiders) did give me a chance 
when no one was even interested in bringing me in," said Jordan before he 
caught a plane to Wisconsin. "It's a great opportunity for me, I guess. 
Basically, they are bringing me in to play. I'll get a chance to get more 
playing time and an opportunity to get better." 
</P>
<P>
 What made Jordan expendable, he was traded for an undisclosed draft choice, 
was the fact that the Raiders are blessed with talent at wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always a difficult process when you have to release people," Raider 
Coach Art Shell. "It's an unfortunate thing and a tough business. But it's 
something that we have to live with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Jordan is) a quality player, who we've had inquiries about. But, the way our 
squad is structured, we can't keep six (wide receivers)." 
</P>
<P>
 Having a team trade for Jordan would have been highly unlikely prior to last 
season when he signed as a free agent with the Raiders. That's because Jordan, 
who played quarterback and wide receiver at Inglewood Morningside High, had 
played only one season at Long Beach City College in 1988 and was out of 
football for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 He got his chance with the Raiders only after he impressed scouts at an 
all-comers free-agent workout camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, no one but the Raiders wanted to give me a chance last year," said 
Jordan, who was inactive for the first six games last season before being 
placed on injured reserve with a leg injury. "But, they gave me chance and I 
learned a lot here." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan was a longshot's longshot to make the Raiders in training camp a year 
ago, but he kept making plays that caught the coaching staff's attention. The 
problem for Jordan was that no matter how well he played, he always had players 
like Brown, Wright, Jett and Ismail ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
 That was never more evident than this preseason when Hobbs emerged as the 
team's leading receiver. On the plane ride back to Los Angeles following the 
Raiders' victory over Houston on Saturday, Jordan was told by a teammate that 
either he or Hobbs was going to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of expected that I would get traded and not Hobbs once we got back," 
Jordan said. "Basically, people out there knew who Charles Jordan was. I 
figured I would go to Green Bay because Ron Wolf (Packer vice president and 
general manager) was interested in me last year. One reason why I wasn't placed 
on the practice roster last year was because the Raiders knew that the Packers 
would pick me up off of waivers." 
</P>
<P>
 To trim their roster from 60 players to 53 Sunday, the Raiders also waived 
defensive end Alberto White, wide receiver John Morton, defensive backs R.J. 
Kors and Cary Brabham and running backs Randy Jordan and Derrick Gainer. 
</P>
<P>
 The release of White is somewhat of a surprise since he led the team in sacks 
during the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders can add five players to their practice squad after 1 p.m. today. 
White, Morton and Brabham are eligible because they do not have a season of 
free-agency credit.

GOLFER'S FATHER, 62, CONFRONTS DALY, AND MINOR SCRAPE ENSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 John Daly, golf's longest hitter, got into a fight with the father of another 
golfer over course etiquette Sunday after Daly shot an 83 in the final round of 
the World Series of Golf. 
</P>
<P>
 According to witnesses, Daly, 28, was grabbed from behind by Bob Roth, 62, 
after the two exchanged words near the entrance to the pro shop.Roth was upset 
because Daly twice had hit balls into the group ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth's son, Jeffrey, was in the twosome ahead of Daly. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Roth and Daly fell to the ground, wrestled briefly and were 
separated by the crowd. Neither was hurt badly, although Roth's left elbow was 
scraped and needed to be bandaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Akron police Lt. Michael Woody said he spoke with representatives of both men, 
and neither wanted to file charges. Police planned no further action. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's out of proportion now, so it doesn't need to be expounded upon," the 
elder Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly could not be located for comment. But Terry Travis, the caddie for golfer 
Ikuo Shirahama, said Daly was not at fault. Travis said he saw the fight break 
out and pulled Daly away from Roth. 
</P>
<P>
 "John's coming out of the clubhouse," Travis said. "There's something said. It 
looked like John said, 'Sorry about that' and started to walk away. Then the 
guy grabs him from behind."

PREP FOOTBALL '94 / CENTURY LEAGUE; CHERRINGTON STICKS TO FAMILIAR TERRITORY; 
FOOTBALL: SANTA ANA VALLEY'S STAR RUNNING BACK IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE, DESPITE 
ALL THE RUMORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dwayne Cherrington, that blur of a running back, is taking his act on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 He's going to play at Foothill High School. The offensive linemen are big 
there and he'll gain thousands and thousands of yards behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 No wait. 
</P>
<P>
 He's going to Villa Park to fill the hole left by Grant Pearsall, now at USC. 
Cherrington will love that offense -- pitch left, pitch right, blast up the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
 No wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwayne's going to Mater Dei, even better. Where else would a wayward tailback 
end up? 
</P>
<P>
 No wait . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Well, a summer of rumors are over. Cherrington is at Santa Ana Valley, right 
where it all began. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody kept asking me, 'Are you going here? Are you going there?' " 
Cherrington said. "Some guys I knew wanted me to go to another school. The next 
thing I knew, I was transferring to every school. It started bugging me. I'm 
happy to be at Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Think Falcon Coach Scott Orloff was happy to hear that? 
</P>
<P>
 Cherrington is one of the premier running backs in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 He gained 815 yards as a sophomore and that was with poor eyesight. Last 
season, wearing contact lenses, he gained 1,234 yards and scored 13 touchdowns. 
He had a 327-yard game against Dana Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 But one thing has eluded this elusive runner: the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons were 3-6-1 in 1992 and 5-5 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure it has been frustrating for him," Orloff said. "I could see his 
confidence go down last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the rumors started. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard them," Orloff said. "It was always, 'Dwayne is going here or there.' 
I don't know what was true. Kids talk to kids all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 The hot talk had Cherrington headed to Villa Park or Foothill, two Century 
League schools. Mater Dei was tossed in there, as well. The Monarchs have had 
tailbacks transfer there before. 
</P>
<P>
 No one seemed to believe Cherrington when he said he was staying put. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a trip," Cherrington said. "I wasn't really thinking about going 
anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Which was good news to Orloff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dwayne never indicated he was leaving," Orloff said. "He was here everyday, 
working out. I think he has a lot more confidence in our team." 
</P>
<P>
 A confident Cherrington is a dangerous Cherrington. Ask anyone from Dana Hills 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherrington romped through, around and over the Dolphins. When he was done, he 
had scored four touchdowns and had the ninth-best rushing game in county 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was not a one-game wonder.  
</P>
<P>
 Cherrington first got attention as a sophomore, when he outperformed Pearsall, 
a three-year standout at Villa Park. Cherrington had 158 yards in a 21-21 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 He opened last season with a rush. He gained 126 against University in the 
opener, then 135 against Saddleback. By the fifth week of the season, he was 
second in the county in rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dwayne is a natural tailback," Orloff said. "He's able to make moves without 
stopping. That's a God-given talent." 
</P>
<P>
 But he might trade it in for a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons haven't been to the playoffs since 1979. They got close last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 After an 0-2 start in league, Santa Ana Valley won two of its last three 
games. Cherrington was a big reason for the turnaround. He had a 149-yard game 
in an 18-13 victory over Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, the streak could end. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're young, but we have bigger numbers and everything seems to be coming 
together," Cherrington said. "I like this team." 
</P>
<P>
 And he's on it.

SPORTS BOOKS HOPE FOR POSTSEASON; LAS VEGAS: LOSS OF REGULAR-SEASON GAMES PALES 
COMPARED WITH $240 MILLION THAT IS BET ON PLAYOFFS, SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the baseball season, when Las Vegas sports books posted the over-under 
line for regular-season victories, they also posted a disclaimer that teams 
must play 160 games to have action on that wager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once a formal announcement is made as to the length of the season, then the 
determination will be made whether or not to refund, but obviously if 160 games 
are not played, money will be refunded," said Vinny Magliulo, director of the 
race and sports book at Caesars Palace. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same with the pennant and World Series, if there is no postseason, than 
those monies will also be refunded." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Magliulo is taking bets on the triple-A International League. But 
he, along with other sports book operators, says there is little monetary 
impact on casinos with football already being played. Losing the postseason, 
though, would be costly, because 20% of the baseball handle, which was $240 
million statewide last season, is bet during that time.  
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally, we have not done well in the final month in baseball anyway," 
said Art Manteris, director of race and sports operations at the Hilton and 
author of the book "Super Bookie." "There are a lot of circumstances, teams are 
playing rookies or they are out of contention and it's hard to keep track of 
what is going on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to have the opportunity to book the World Series and lose the 
last month of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year there was more than a billion dollars legally bet in Las Vegas on 
sports. Overall, the casinos and race and sports books reported a profit of 
more than $6.6 billion. Of that amount, sports books, which exclude racing, won 
$85 million, with baseball accounting for more than $17 million and football 
for more than $36 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, honestly, that betting on baseball is just a way to connect football 
seasons," said Mike Tenay, a race book manager at the Gold Coast. MARYANN

IDENTITY CRISIS; HARRISON TWINS -- CALVIN AND ALVIN -- COULD OUTRUN EVERYTHING 
EXCEPT THEIR SHORTCOMINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calvin and Alvin Harrison went from relative unknowns to the darlings of 
California high school track and field in June of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Their performances during the final day of the State meet that year were so 
impressive that experts were calling them California's next great hope in the 
Olympics. That the brothers were identical twins with blazing speed made the 
story all the more interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin, the self-proclaimed leader of the two, was the hero of the meet. His 
memorable day included victories in the 200 meters, 400 and 1,600 relay and a 
third-place finish in the 400 relay. 
</P>
<P>
 He won the 400 in a national federation record of 45.25 seconds and the 200 in 
near-record time of 21.12. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1,600 relay, Calvin had to pass three runners on the final lap to win, 
but he made it look easy as he sprinted down the back straightaway purposely 
pointing the shiny baton to a cheering crowd of 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 His early celebration in the relay nearly backfired, as officials met for 20 
minutes trying to decide whether a disqualification was in order for 
unsportsmanlike conduct. They let the victory stand, however, securing North 
Salinas' first team title. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvin's performance was not nearly as publicized, but he ran well on both 
relays and barely missed the finals in the 100 and 200. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Southland schools have dominated the State meet for years, the 
Harrisons provided Northern California with a temporary reprieve, and they 
gained national attention in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
 A week after the State meet, Calvin lowered his 400 time to an astonishing 
45.07 during the Junior National Championships in Spokane. Alvin also starred, 
running a 45.20 in the 400. 
</P>
<P>
 With times close to Olympic caliber, the success would have guaranteed the 
Harrisons athletic scholarships to the colleges of their choice under normal 
circumstances. But their senior year, like most others, was anything but 
normal. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, more than a year later, the 20-year-old Harrisons have dropped out of 
school, are living apart on opposite coasts and are uncertain about their 
futures in track. Coaches who know them shrug their shoulders wondering what 
might have been. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think anyone who saw the State meet in 1993 assumed Calvin would be in the 
Olympics in 1996," said Ed Barber, North Salinas' track coach. "Alvin also 
wasn't far behind. I did everything I could to help those guys. It breaks my 
heart every day to see what has happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Very little has happened since the Harrisons left high school. Nike came 
through with a sponsorship, providing free clothes and equipment. They enrolled 
at Hartnell Junior College in Salinas and went out for the track team. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither performed well in the classroom or on the track. Alvin was dropped 
from the team last April because he did not meet academic requirements, and 
Calvin was kicked off at the same time for failing to attend practice. 
</P>
<P>
 They have not competed since. Alvin moved to Orlando, Fla., to live with his 
parents, and Calvin is working and living alone in Salinas. While the brothers 
say their track careers are not over, they are uncertain about their next step. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Harrisons began running track at North Salinas as freshmen. Calvin usually 
beat Alvin in races, but the brothers trained together and pushed each other. 
</P>
<P>
 North Salinas has never been a track power, so when Calvin qualified for the 
State meet in the 200 as a sophomore, he became an instant hero in the 
community. Although he did not place at State, expectations had been set for 
the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Those expectations were put on hold, however, when the Harrisons moved with 
their family to Orlando. Unhappy in their new environment, Calvin and Alvin sat 
out the 1992 season and concentrated on returning to California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Track wasn't that big of a deal down there," Calvin said. "We wanted the 
exposure good athletes get on the West Coast. We wanted back at our old 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 The twins, the middle of six children, received permission from their parents 
to return to North Salinas for their senior year after securing a place to live 
with a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Living on their own was not easy. The brothers moved several times. Without 
parental guidance, the Harrisons struggled with their studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just have not learned how to be responsible," Barber said. "They have 
million dollar smiles and they know how to charm people and win them over. But 
they hurt a lot of people in the process." 
</P>
<P>
 Barber could not have been happier when Calvin and Alvin returned. He said 
working with such talented sprinters made him a better coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealing with two teen-agers on their own, however, required great patience. To 
keep them eligible, Barber monitored their academics. And to make sure they did 
not spend their idle time getting into trouble, he often invited them to his 
house for dinner and a game of pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers responded by doing well in track, putting North Salinas on the 
map. Despite sitting out their junior year, Calvin and Alvin performed as if 
they had been running their whole lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Interscholastic Federation, which puts on the State meet, 
initially canceled the finals at Cerritos College because heavy rains left the 
track unsafe. Pressure from coaches, parents and athletes resulted in a 
rescheduled meet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harrisons considered not running in the makeup meet because of prior 
commitments but changed their minds to help the team. The two-week delay did 
not hurt their times, as both recorded several personal bests. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was one of the most dominating performances I have ever seen in high 
school competition," Ron Allice, track coach at USC, said of Calvin. "I was in 
shock when I left that day." 
</P>
<P>
 Barber said college coaches from around the country were equally impressed and 
often called him to find out more. The calls usually stopped after one. 
</P>
<P>
 The coaches quickly found out that the Harrisons lacked enough credits to 
graduate from high school and also did not have qualifying scores on college 
entrance exams. 
</P>
<P>
 With no diplomas and limited options, the twins enrolled at Hartnell. They 
passed their entrance exams and qualified for financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had verbal and written agreements with Calvin and Alvin about what was 
expected of them," said Gary Shaw, Hartnell's track coach. "I told them if they 
ever wanted to be Division I athletes that they had to attend class and go to 
track practice. You can't do one without the other." 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin passed his classes but attended practice on an average of only twice a 
week. He said he did not agree with Shaw's coaching techniques and was unhappy. 
Alvin regularly attended practice but was struggling in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin's lack of enthusiasm surfaced in meets. His times were below what he 
was running as a high school senior as he failed to surpass 46 seconds in the 
400. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw's patience was wearing thin. When Alvin lost his eligibility because of 
academic troubles, he kicked Calvin off the team because of his lack of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a whole team to think about and it wasn't fair to keep giving them the 
benefit of the doubt," Shaw said. "They both have Olympic potential, but you 
have to be willing to play by the rules. I don't think they quite understand 
that yet." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Allice, the former Long Beach City coach who recently took over at USC, said 
leaving Hartnell might spell trouble for the Harrisons. Academically, they are 
not qualified to transfer to a Division I college. They also cannot run at 
another junior college until they fulfill course requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Outside of a few prestigious club teams, the best coaching and facilities in 
the country are at the college level," Allice said. "Calvin and Alvin may not 
be quite elite enough yet for a club, so college is their best option. Without 
it, I don't think they can go very far." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvin returned to Orlando in May and is working on a computer assembly line. 
He would like to return to California in January to begin training, but is 
uncertain whether he will try again at Hartnell or pursue a club. 
</P>
<P>
 "Financially, I am finally able to save some money since I am living at home," 
he said. "A lot of other athletes out there had more money and support than 
Calvin and I had. It's tough when you're trying to go it alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin is also uncertain of his plans, but said the time off might help him 
put things in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother and I had a lot of success come to us very fast, and with that 
success came quite a bit of pressure," he said. "I know I still want to run, 
but I need to figure out what is best for me and how I'll be the happiest."

NORTHRIDGE LITTLE LEAGUE NATIONAL CHAMPIONS; MAKING A RUN AT GLORY AND FUN; 
COACHES: SPIRIT OF VOLUNTEERISM -- AS EXEMPLIFIED BY FRANK POLITO -- HAS BEEN A 
HALLMARK OF LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 55 years Little League has endured. And for 40 of them, Frank Polito has 
been there. Polito, 79, is among the tens of thousands of volunteer coaches in 
Little League, an organization that last year attracted 2.7 million children in 
79 countries, including 2.5 million in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 They are insurance agents and lawyers, plumbers and business executives -- 
hard-working, blue-collar and middle-class parents who give up countless hours 
of their time for the pure, simple pleasure of teaching kids to play ball. 
</P>
<P>
 For Polito, it has been a passion for 40 seasons. Get to know him and you see 
why Little League carries on. In an era in which major league baseball strikes 
seem inevitable, Little League remains a summer certainty, as comfortable as a 
favorite glove. 
</P>
<P>
 Polito has been a fixture of Little League baseball in Alhambra, a gruff 
former truck driver who has coached hundreds of kids, a hard-nosed taskmaster 
who players unfailingly address as "Mister Polito." 
</P>
<P>
 Not Coach. Not Frank. Mister Polito .  
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, he coached both of his sons -- now in their 50s -- and all 
four of his grandsons. He won so many Alhambra National Little League 
championships he doesn't remember the exact number. 
</P>
<P>
 Former players recall Polito bellowing commands so loud they were audible two 
playing fields away. 
</P>
<P>
 But his players also talk of him patiently teaching the fundamentals not only 
of baseball but of life: the perils of showboating, the rewards of teamwork, 
how to win with humility and lose with grace. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you didn't play on the Giants, you were intimidated by him," said his son 
Vince, 51, who himself coached Little League for 18 years. "But if you played 
on the Giants, you loved him." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Little League coaches volunteer in hopes of forging a special bond with 
their sons or daughters through sports. But others, like George Saul, assistant 
coach of this year's Northridge Little League, have no children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have several people like that, who dedicate their time to the kids," said 
Denise Aronson, a former longtime board member and volunteer for the Northridge 
league. "They honestly care about kids and the game of baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 For many coaches, Little League represents a chance to instill in their 
children the virtues of hard work, loyalty and self-sacrifice, small-town 
American values encouraged by the league since it was founded in 1939 by a 
Williamsport, Pa., lumber-yard clerk, Carl E. Stotz. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the years coaches often have been at the center of controversies that 
have smudged Little League's squeaky-clean image. Among them: cheating scandals 
and even on-the-field violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Little League international division disqualified teams from 
Taiwan and the Dominican Republic from the Little League World Series after 
coaches fielded ineligible players. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1992, the Little League season in Albuquerque, N.M., was cut short 
because of hostility and fighting among adults. A postgame fight that sent one 
person to the hospital included a group of parents, a league director, a coach 
and even the coach's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 That same year, a coach in Whiteville, N.C., used a pocketknife to slash the 
throat of another coach in front of 100 Little Leaguers, spattering blood on 
one boy's jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, gung-ho coaches are perennial targets of critics who say they push 
kids too hard to win, fail to let less-talented kids play and set bad examples 
by arguing and swearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have all seen managers who exerted a wonderful influence upon their boys 
-- an influence which was as fine an educational experience as any lad might 
undergo," wrote the late Dr. Arthur A. Esslinger in the official Little League 
rules handbook. "Unfortunately, we have also observed a few managers who were a 
menace to children." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the excesses of some adults, Little League is more popular than ever. 
From 1 million players in 1982, its player rolls burgeoned to 1.8 million five 
years ago and 2.7 million today. 
</P>
<P>
 And they are led through seasons both good and bad by coaches such as Polito, 
whose hard-guy exterior and foghorn voice disguise a fundamental affection for 
kids that was never lost on them. 
</P>
<P>
 The grandson of Italian immigrants, Polito for many years drove a trailer 
truck for the Vons supermarket chain.  
</P>
<P>
 After work on game days, he showed on the field dressed in his gray work 
uniform, his arms sternly crossed over his chest, his eyes squinting from 
beneath the lid of a black Giants cap as his young charges played their 
regulation six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, he has watched as changing demographics and social mores have 
altered Little League, pushing it inexorably out of the innocent, 
Leave-It-to-Beaver years of the 1940s and '50s into the more contentious, and 
more democratic 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 He saw the forced admission of girls into Little League baseball in 1974 (when 
Congress revised the Little League charter over league officials' objections).  
</P>
<P>
 He has seen the effects on kids of a rising divorce rate.  
</P>
<P>
 He has seen how the growing Asian and Latino communities in Alhambra have 
changed the racial makeup of local teams. 
</P>
<P>
 He approves of the admission of girls into Little League baseball, saying they 
have been among his better players.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had one year when I had two girls," he said. "I had one in the All-Stars . 
. . She handled herself pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 He worries about competition for playing fields from adult softball teams. And 
he frets about parents who use Little League as a cheap baby-sitting service. 
</P>
<P>
 But when all is said and done, he keeps coming back, season after season, year 
after year, a gravel-voiced Mr. Chips in cleats, eager for the next inning, the 
next squeeze play, the next home run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he loves the kids," said his son Vince.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think he loves to see their development. I think he gave a lot of his heart 
to the kids. And they in turn felt that." 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Polito still plays too -- in a softball league every Tuesday night. And 
in the stands, every week, there is Frank Polito, watching his boy play ball.

 "I think one of the reasons they chose me to be manager was because I had a 
station wagon. Little League is both good and bad. You're supposed to be 
teaching the kids good sportsmanship; meanwhile the parents in the stands are 
bad sports." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Larry Markes, coach of the 1967-69 West Valley Little League team, The 
Stars Memories of Little League and Sandlot Days 
</P>
<P>
 "The game has always been kind of magic to me. I really enjoyed it a lot and I 
suppose I even do now. . . . In one game I hit a couple of home runs, and I 
don't even remember rounding the bases." 
</P>
<P>
 -- David Alford, pastor of the Northridge Assembly of God Church 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was young, there was no such thing as Little League . . . Now that 
it's more organized, they say there's more sportsmanship. But you had to have 
sportsmanship then. Where is home plate going to be? You've got to work all 
those things out -- there's no rules." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Santa Clarita City Councilman H. Clyde Smyth 
</P>
<P>

did a lot for my confidence. It gave me the sense that I could do anything I 
wanted."

University of Oklahoma on athletic scholarship

 "It's the first time in your life that you're part of a group of guys who all 
have the same common goal." 
</P>

 -- Bob Lofrano, Pierce College baseball coach 
</P>
<P>
 *

<P>
 "It was exhilarating. It was fun to be part of a team, to compete and run 
fast. . . . I didn't play with men, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Feminist attorney Gloria Allred on playing sandlot games with her 
girlfriends 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have Little League during my time. . . . If there were not enough 
of us, we played over-the-line in the playground. It was one of the things that 
kept us out of trouble. We'd start at 7 a.m. and played until the sun went 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rudy Acuna, CSUN Chicano studies professor 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We were tied after the sixth inning, so I came in for the extra innings and 
struck out eight out of nine. Then, in the ninth, I hit a leadoff double, was 
bunted to third and scored on a squeeze play. It was one of those days where I 
could do no wrong."

<P>
 -- Victor Gill, spokesman for Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority

out, you struck out and there was no argument from anyone."

 -- Los Angeles Police Sgt. Miguel Arroyo on playing sandlot ball in Lincoln 
Heights  
</P>
<P>

 "Little League was quite an experience. It gave you something to look forward 
to. I was an excellent ballplayer. But I reached the point when I had to make a 
choice between pursuing baseball or music. It was easy. In the minor leagues 
you made $50 a month; as a musician I made $75 a week." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ernani Bernardi, former Los Angeles City Councilman and professional 
musician  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the biggest things I learned was how to play with other kids and get 
along with them. Sportsmanship was also stressed, of course, but the thing I 
remember most was that I always seemed to be a year ahead of the team that went 
the furthest in postseason play."

NORTHRIDGE LITTLE LEAGUE NATIONAL CHAMPIONS; PLAYERS, COACHES FORM A FAMILY 
PORTRAIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Winning the Little League national championship requires more than ability 
from the players and coaches. Tolerance and understanding, dedication and 
determination are equally important. And a strong dose of humor doesn't hurt, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge players and coaches virtually lived together for two months, 
practicing every day from the last week of June until the World Series 
championship game Saturday. The team became a family, with each member 
contributing. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at each member of the Northridge Little League national championship 
team:  
</P>
<P>
 John-Michael Baca: The son of Manager Larry Baca was one of two 11-year-olds 
on the team. The smallest player on the team at 4-foot-10, 85 pounds, he will 
add World Series experience to next season's all-star team. Baca was added to 
the roster for the Western Regional and World Series, and played in the 
regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Cassel: The youngest of the 12-year-old players, Cassel played with 
poise. The first baseman handled numerous ground balls because most 
right-handed batters swung late against the fastballs Northridge pitchers 
threw. Cassel led the team at the World Series with a batting average of .429. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Cunningham: He began tournament play as a pitcher and center fielder, but 
his role changed drastically when catcher Jonathan Higashi was declared 
ineligible after divisional play. Cunningham had never played catcher, but 
excelled behind the plate and supplied power on offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Delevie: Delevie had the job of backup catcher, and he performed with 
great enthusiasm. He warmed up pitchers in the bullpen and on the field between 
innings, wearing his catcher's gear throughout every game. Delevie's constant 
positive attitude rubbed off on his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Drake Jr.: Fast and versatile, Drake played outfield and infield in a 
reserve role. He also hit well when given the opportunity. But his greatest 
contribution was as a pinch-runner. Drake scored several crucial runs with 
heads-up baserunning. Nicknamed Scooter. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathaniel Dunlap: The tallest Northridge player at 5-foot-11, Dunlap loomed 
large in the team's success. He was a dominant pitcher, averaging more than two 
strikeouts an inning, and striking out six batters for every walk he allowed. 
Dunlap pitched a complete game to win the United States championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Fisher: Smooth and fluid, Fisher played shortstop with grace. He 
transfers the ball from his glove to his throwing hand with the quickness of a 
major leaguer and never made a throwing error in tournament play. Weighing only 
95 pounds, Fisher also hit with great power, batting fifth in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Frost: Frost batted about .700 in a reserve role through the first 
three tournaments, and finally was inserted in the starting lineup during 
regional and World Series play when Cunningham moved to catcher. Frost then 
played the position vacated by whoever was pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 Justin Gentile: Any team would love a leadoff hitter who hit five home runs in 
the first three all-star games, and that is just what Gentile provided 
Northridge. Gentile played second base when not pitching. He pitched a 
one-hitter in the World Series, throwing a changeup he called The Agony. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer Gordon: The son of two attorneys, Gordon is quick-witted and clever. 
He is a solid cleanup hitter and hit two home runs in the World Series. As a 
right fielder, he started a Northridge triple play in the sectional tournament. 
His homer against Venezuela was the team's final run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Nesbit: Small and wiry, the athletic Nesbit was an outstanding 
defensive outfielder who was inserted to help protect leads late in games. He 
played two innings in the World Series final after center fielder Nathaniel 
Dunlap injured his thumb. Nesbit used his speed as a pinch-runner in most 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 David Teraoka: A powerful hitter and good first baseman, Teraoka had his 
shining moment come in the Western Regional final when starter Matt Cassel 
could not play because of an injured hand. Teraoka made several fine defensive 
plays and hit a key double off the fence in right field to spark the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Tuber: The grandson of former National League batting champion Pete 
Reiser played with the poise of a major leaguer. Tuber was unflappable, a 
characteristic that served him well on the mound. He notched three victories in 
the Western Regional and won his only World Series start. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregg Wallis: The only 11-year-old starter, Wallis provided a steady glove and 
accurate arm at third base. He played shallow, taking away opponents' 
opportunities to bunt and daring them to swing away. Batting in the the ninth 
position, he contributed several key hits, including a handful of doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Larry Baca: Soft-spoken and kind, Baca is a model for anyone wishing 
to become a Little League manager. Thrust into the media spotlight, he never 
criticized a player and constantly tried to focus attention on the team. 
Emotional 12-year-old players need a steady hand to guide them through the 
roller-coaster ride of five consecutive tournaments, and Baca provided it in 
expert fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach George Saul: He has been Baca's close friend for nearly 30 years and his 
coaching partner for 15. Saul contributed sound technical coaching, quietly 
instructing players on an individual basis. Saul is the consummate Little 
League volunteer, involved because he loves kids and loves coaching. His 
dedication landed him in the World Series although it was the last thing on his 
mind.

TOURNAMENT 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Northridge 23, Vista National 6 -- Fisher and Tuber combined for 10 of 
Northridge's 26 hits. Tuber hit a grand slam, and Higashi, Fisher and Dunlap 
also homered. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge 11, Whittier 0 -- Dunlap, dedicating the performance to his 
grandfather who died three days earlier, pitched a one-hitter and struck out 
nine. Tuber celebrated his birthday by hitting his fourth home run in as many 
tournament games. Higashi and Cassel also homered. WESTERN REGIONAL 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge 14, Anchorage, Alaska 2 -- Higashi was out of the lineup, Frost was 
in, and Northridge kept right on rolling. Higashi, the team's starting catcher, 
was removed from the team after a letter sent to Little League officials 
revealed he lived outside the league's boundaries. Cunningham moved in behind 
the plate from right field and Frost filled the outfield slot. Frost had three 
hits, including a two-run home run in the game at San Bernardino. Gordon and 
Fisher also hit two-run homers. Tuber and Dunlap combined on a one-hitter, but 
the game was close until Northridge scored 10 times in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge 10, Las Vegas 0 -- Gentile hit. Gentile pitched. Northridge hit the 
jackpot. Gentile's solo home run in the fourth and two-run shot in the fifth 
backed his own dominant pitching. He struck out 10 and cruised after pitching 
out of a first-inning, bases-loaded jam. Cassel also homered. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge 12, Altamont, N.M. 0 -- Tuber was pitching a perfect game until he 
allowed a single with two out in the fifth. He settled for a one-hitter, 
striking out eight and walking one. Cunningham had three hits and scored twice. 
Fisher and Wallis each added two hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge 3, Taylorsville, Utah 1 -- In a duel between hard-throwing Dunlap 
and Schafer Magana, Utah's-breaking ball specialist, Northridge survived by 
scoring twice on wild pitches. Magana allowed four hits. Dunlap threw a 
two-hitter and struck out eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge 17, Waianae Hawaii 7 -- Cunningham was hitless in three at-bats 
with a key defensive miscue when he stepped to the plate in the sixth in a 7-7 
tie. He homered to spark a 10-run inning as Northridge became the first team 
from the San Fernando Valley to advance to the Little League World Series since 
1975. For good measure, Cunningham added a grand slam later in the inning. 
Fisher contributed three of Northridge's 18 hits. Tuber won his third game of 
the regional, striking out 11 in 5 1/3 innings of relief. WORLD SERIES 
</P>
<P>
 Brooklyn Center, Minn. 4, Northridge 2 -- A trend continued. Teams from 
Northridge in 1967 and '75 also lost their first World Series games. 
Unfortunately for them, the tournament had a single-elimination format then. 
After averaging more than 13 runs a game in winning 17 consecutive postseason 
games, Northridge was held to one hit by right-hander Steve Kruger in 
Williamsport, Pa. Cunningham provided the only hit, a home run in his first 
World Series at-bat and his third home run in his last three at-bats. Dunlap 
struck out 13, but allowed three runs with two out in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge 6, Middleboro, Mass. 4 -- What, him worry? Not Cassel. Instead of 
fretting over Northridge's tenuous position, the Northridge first baseman did 
something about it. Cassel's three-run home run in the third gave Northridge a 
4-0 lead. A solo homer by Gentile in the fourth proved decisive. Tuber struck 
out 13 and pitched a complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge 2, Springfield, Va. 0 -- Northridge got the victory it needed to 
advance to the U.S. title game behind a one-hit pitching performance by 
Gentile, who struck out 13 and walked two. The only hit he allowed was a single 
by Eric Miller leading off the game. Northridge scored on a single by Dunlap in 
the third and a sacrifice fly by Frost in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge 3, Springfield, Va. 0 -- And Springfield thought Gentile was tough. 
Dunlap almost duplicated his teammate's pitching performance of the previous 
day, allowing only one hit and striking out 10 without a walk. Dunlap finished 
the playoffs with 103 strikeouts in 54 innings. He carried a no-hitter into the 
sixth, and when Ethan Lare, Springfield's best hitter, came to the plate with 
two on and two outs, Dunlap struck him out on three pitches -- all fastballs. 
Gordon's three-run, first-inning homer provided all the runs. Gentile had two 
doubles and Cassel had a pair of singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Maracaibo, Venezuela 4, Northridge 3 -- Gentile and his palm ball were 
baffling Venezuelan hitters. Then lightning struck. Rain, hail and lightning 
forced a three-hour delay. After play resumed, Northridge's right-hander gave 
up seven hits and unleashed five wild pitches. Cesar Hidalgo pitched a 
three-hitter for Venezuela. The only earned run he allowed was a fifth-inning 
solo home run by Gordon. Tuber and Cassel had Northridge's only other hits -- 
both singles. Hidalgo, throwing fastballs in the low-to-mid 70 m.p.h.-range, 
struck out 10 and walked two. Gentile struck out eight. MIKE HISERMAN

 "For the fourth time, T----, will you stop talking while I'm talking to the 
class!" I hear her mutter to someone, "She's a racist, you know." J--- takes 
the hall pass to go for a class readmittance form and returns an unacceptable 
33 minutes later. His comment on his subsequent referral slip reads, "She's 
racism" (sic). 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, I addressed the behaviors of the students, yet each perceivedmy 
admonition as a racist act. Although these scenarios are not common, theyoccur 
often enough to be unsettling. Off the tongues of young people who barely know 
its meaning rolls this current "in" word -- this button-pushing, 
sit-up-and-take-notice, I'm-good, you're-bad word -- racist.  
</P>
<P>
 I am a racist because I do not allow graffiti on the desks and walls of my 
room. I am a racist because I assign detentions for tardies. I am a racist 
because I do not tolerate classroom disruption. I am a racist because I demand 
respect, not so much for myself as an individual but for my seniority and my 
professional position. All too often, however, I find myself on the defensive 
as I attempt to maintain an environment conducive to learning. I am the bad guy 
-- not because I am the teacher and an adult, but because I am not the right 
color. 
</P>
<P>
 With all of the conferences and activities and publicity on tensions between 
cultures and races at our multiethnic, multicultural high school, one would be 
naive to think that there is no racism here. But maybe there's been too much 
ballyhoo. There has been so much rhetoric about different races and cultures 
over the last few years that many of the students see any confrontation between 
members of different cultures or ethnic groups as racist. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it's time to de-emphasize and the prefixes of those words that seem to 
be separating the student body. Perhaps we should take the black student, the 
white student, the Hispanic student, the Asian and Pacific Islander student 
(did I forget anyone?) and make each simply a student. Within the classroom 
walls, then, would be teachers and students, labels undisputed and understood 
by all. Disciplinary measures from teacher to student are necessary, expected, 
and, in most cases, beneficial to the social and emotional growth of the 
adolescent. 
</P>
<P>
 A student who regards discipline as something based on color or background, 
not behavior, is unlikely to change. And there, not in knee-jerk accusations of 
racism, is the real harm to society.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: PLATFORM; PROP. 187: 
'RACIST INITIATIVE' OR A 'STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Compiled for The Times by Lorenza Munoz.

 On Nov. 8, Californians will vote on a controversial initiative on 
immigration, Proposition 187, the so-called Save Our State initiative (See box, 
right). Here are opinions on the initiative from Latinos and Latinas, a 
community that arguably will be most affected if S.O.S. passes.  
</P>
<P>
 EDGAR APARICIO 
</P>
<P>
 Artist, 44, legal resident who emigrated from El Salvador 12 years ago 
</P>
<P>
 I came here because of the war in El Salvador (after his wife, brother, 
sister-in-law and daughter were killed). 
</P>
<P>
 What I have heard about the initiative is that it will prohibit illegal 
immigrants from receiving medical benefits, and the children will be denied 
education. It is justified by stating that it will save money, but what is 
forgotten is that the refugees are here as a result of American policy toward 
the countries we came from. It is a policy of helping repressive regimes, not a 
policy of helping to create jobs in our countries or solving the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The sad and contradictory part is that we are in a worse situation here. With 
this initiative we would not have access to health care. What country in the 
world denies health care to a human being? Even a country like Cuba that is 
poor and criticized for its economic system has the sensibility to understand 
that the essential elements for a human being are access to health care and an 
education. Denying illegal immigrants an education would only increase the 
formation of gangs and juvenile delinquency.  
</P>
<P>
 This initiative would have normal folks, like teachers, whose mission is to 
educate, point a finger at a person who looks illegal. That would be the 
saddest thing for a teacher, to learn how to destroy rather than construct. It 
would have police officers and doctors or nurses point a finger at somebody who 
comes asking for help. CELESTE GREIG  
</P>
<P>
 Importer/exporter, naturalized American citizen who emigrated from Spain 27 
years ago 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The sad part of Proposition 187 is that our elected officials have blatantly 
disregarded the will of the people, therefore we have to go through the process 
of the initiative in order to implement the laws. They have failed to come up 
with good legal immigration policy.  
</P>
<P>
 I think that this is not a perfect initiative, but it's a step in the right 
direction. A lot of people from the opposition claim we are using the illegal 
aliens as scapegoats because of the economy. That is not true.  
</P>
<P>
 These individuals that come here, granted, come here to seek a better life due 
to finances at home. I know for a fact that there is a very small percentage of 
them who come here because of disturbances in their countries.  
</P>
<P>
 I don't think that the illegal aliens are to blame for crime. However, I do 
feel very strongly that they do contribute to the decay of the economy. Some 
people claim that they pay their share of taxes, but I am in business. Most of 
these people do not pay their share of taxes because when they come here they 
do not have documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Our children are not getting enough education -- the classrooms are crowded. I 
sympathize with all of the children, legal or illegal, but let's face it: We 
have to take care of our people first.  
</P>
<P>
 Personally, if I came across somebody who I knew was an illegal alien I could 
not report them. I know it is hard to comprehend why I am supporting the S.O.S. 
initiative and why I would be unable to turn somebody in, but I just couldn't 
do it. That will be the role of law enforcement and the school system. PETE 
NAVARRO 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney, 43, Los Angeles native 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This initiative is the most racist initiative ever. It targets the Mexican, 
Central American and Asian communities. The proponents of this initiative are 
using the immigrant population as scapegoats for the economic woes of this 
state, which are the result, in my opinion, of Republican economic policies in 
the past 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 This initiative targets the most vulnerable segments of our population: 
children and the sick. The children of the immigrants had no choice in the 
matter as to immigrate. They have no political power -- they can't vote. And 
the uninsured sick who have no health benefits, can't qualify for medical, are 
in the worst position to fight for their rights.  
</P>
<P>
 It also doesn't make practical sense. The initiative states that, undocumented 
or not, all are eligible for emergency health care. That means, if I was 
undocumented and have a cough and a fever, I go to the clinic or general 
hospital, I will be denied care. So I have to wait until it develops into 
pneumonia, then I'll be eligible and they'll have to spend thousands of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents don't mind illegal immigrants cleaning their toilets, taking care 
of their children and mowing their lawns and on the other hand talking about 
all of these problems that illegal immigrants are causing. Illegal immigration 
is a problem that is larger than what this initiative or any local initiative 
can handle. It's a global problem, tied to international economics. FEDERICO 
MARISCAL 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican citizen, 24, attending USC on a student visa 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I think this is a really complex problem, but I agree with the proponents. 
There are too many people here already. The United States has lots of problems 
with health care and crime. They have to take care of their problems first 
before they take care of the problems of illegal aliens. I think one of the 
problems is that illegal immigrants don't merge into American society. For 
example, Mexicans stay Mexican and Asians stay Asians -- everyone has their own 
society. They can't melt into American society in general if they don't want 
to. 
</P>
<P>
 I think Mexican heritage and culture is so strong that it's really hard for 
them to melt into American society. I am not saying that we have to forget our 
heritage as Mexicans; I think we have a great history and culture and we have 
to be proud of it. However, if you are coming here, you have to change a little 
bit. To break into another culture you have to at least speak the language.  
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico it is very, very hard to become a Mexican citizen. What we have to 
do as Mexicans is try to improve the situation in Mexico. If these people want 
to leave Mexico it's because something is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 AMANDA  
</P>
<P>
 Undocumented immigrant, 34, who arrived in Los Angeles from Honduras 18 months 
ago  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think this initiative will cease immigration to this country. The 
causes of immigration originate in our countries. There is too much poverty, 
too much injustice, terrible economic conditions, political repression and 
those causes still persist in our countries.I came here not only for a better 
way to live (myself) but to provide a better way of life for my family. I could 
not come here with my two children. I left them in Honduras with my family. My 
intention is to stay here for a while and then go back, because really the 
situation here is not very easy.  
</P>
<P>
 In our countries we are not aware of the services that are offered here. We 
only hope to improve ourselves and to work. We do pay taxes -- we consume goods 
and services. This issue of illegal immigration needs to be looked at in a more 
creative way such as understanding the factors of immigration, and how much 
immigrants contribute to this country, economically and culturally. It cannot 
be looked at in only a negative light.  
</P>
<P>
 My life here has been very difficult and sad. It's hard coming to a new 
country and leaving my family and experiencing discrimination. The negative 
effects of this initiative are already being felt. The fear in the immigrant 
community is growing. What the Ballot Proposal Would Do 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, which will appear on the Nov. 8 ballot, seeks to discourage 
illegal immigration by denying publicly funded benefits. Critics say immigrants 
come to the United States for jobs, not benefits. Here are the major 
provisions:  
</P>
<P>
 HEALTH SERVICES * Current law: Illegal immigrants may receive a wide variety 
of care at publicly funded hospitals and clinics. Federal law bars health 
facilities from denying emergency aid to anyone.  
</P>
<P>
 * Proposition 187: Denies non-emergency public care to those who cannot prove 
legal status, including prenatal and postnatal services.  
</P>
<P>
 SOCIAL SERVICES  
</P>
<P>
 * Current law: Federal and state laws bar illegal immigrants from most major 
benefits, such as welfare and unemployment insurance.  
</P>
<P>
 * Proposition 187: Cuts off a host of other state and locally funded programs 
that are directed toward troubled youths, the blind and other illegal 
immigrants with special needs. FRAUDULENT DOCUMENTS 
</P>
<P>
 * Current law: The use of fraudulent documents to prove residency is illegal.  
</P>
<P>
 * Proposition 187: Creates new state felonies and stiffens penalties.  
</P>
<P>
 EDUCATION * Current law: Court rulings have held that undocumented children 
are entitled to elementary and secondary public school education. Illegal 
immigrants may also attend state colleges and universities, but most are 
charged non-resident tuition rates.  
</P>
<P>
 * Proposition 187: Bars enrollment in all public schools, colleges and 
universities. Parents or guardians of all schoolchildren, including U.S. 
citizens, would likewise have to demonstrate legal residence. The law would 
oblige school administrators to report students and parents suspected of being 
illegal immigrants.  
</P>
<P>
 LAW ENFORCEMENT COOPERATION 
</P>
<P>
 * Current law: Many local police agencies avoid getting involved in 
immigration matters because they believe it would discourage victims and 
witnesses from reporting crimes.  
</P>
<P>
 * Proposition 187: State, city and county law enforcement authorities would be 
obligated to question arrestees about their citizenship or immigration status 
and report suspected illegal immigrants to the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service and the state attorney general.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A visit to the Statue of Liberty could lead one to believe that the United 
States, a nation founded by immigrants seeking a better life, has through its 
history rolled out the red carpet for new arrivals. But many of those who 
passed through the eastern gateway to the land of opportunity in the 19th 
Century -- Italians, Irish, Jews -- were considered unwanted interlopers by 
earlier settlers and faced discrimination when they arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 America continued to have an official open-door policy until 1882, when 
Congress passed the Chinese Exclusionary Act. For the first time, one ethnic 
group was completely barred from entering the country. Since then, a variety of 
groups -- Japanese, Filipinos and Koreans -- have encountered anti-immigrant 
bias and legislation to limit their numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The group that comes before always turns their back on the next immigrant 
group," says Antonio Gonzalez, executive director of the Southwest Voter 
Registration Project in Los Angeles. "That tends to be a recurrent theme in 
history." 
</P>
<P>
 That theme appears to be repeating itself in California with the introduction 
of Proposition 187, which seeks to limit health care and education services to 
undocumented immigrants. In today's Platform, members of the Latino community 
argue the pros and cons of the initiative that some have labeled "Save Our 
State" and that Gonzalez calls "Help Sink Our State." 
</P>
<P>
 "This proposition creates a climate of discrimination, fear and scapegoating 
of many people in California -- not only of immigrants but of people who might 
look like immigrants," Gonzalez says. 
</P>
<P>
 "This discrimination always coincides with a period of economic problems," 
says Gonzalez, whose organization tries to increase the political participation 
of Latinos throughout the Southwest. That is especially true in Southern 
California, where even the arrival in the 1930s the "Okies" -- immigrants 'from 
Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas and Missouri -- caused many to fear they would drain 
the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic problem was that they were poor and they were considered to be a 
load on the welfare system," says David Heer, a sociology professor at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, laws restricting the Okies' access to welfare were passed, a highly 
punitive move, since migrant workers depended on supplemental income to survive 
in the off-season, says Lisa Lawson, a public policy specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 "World War II saved them," says Lawson, a member of Proponents of Responsible 
Immigration Debate and Education. "All of a sudden, the defense industry moved 
to California and the Oakies went to work in the factories." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the pattern of discrimination remains. "When times are harder, people 
say that immigrants are going to take away jobs from Americans," says Gary 
Galles, an economic professor at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem isn't immigration," Galles says, but minimum-wage laws and other 
policies that keep new arrivals from becoming productive job-holders. "From the 
time this country was started, says Galles, "immigrants have always been a 
source of economic growth."

WORKER SAFETY: 'IT PAYS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By A.B. ROBINSON and DIANE FACTOR, Robinson is Corporate safety executive for 
the Fluor Corp., Irvine; Factor is a former Cal-OSHA inspector; UCLA Labor 
Center. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Earlier this month, three workers died at a Ventura County oil drilling site. 
In Los Angeles, Cal-OSHA concluded that contractors working on the Los Angeles 
Red Line Line tunnels violated more than 80 safety regulations. Two experts 
comment:  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Year in and year out, (my industry,) construction, ranks as the first or 
second-most dangerous to work in. We came to realize many, many years ago that 
safe environments are productive environments, that safety and quality are 
interchangeable and that there's a link between good safety and positive 
morale. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly we've got to realize there are also tangible bottom line benefits. 
Accident prevention is, in our opinion, the only sure-fire way to control 
workers' compensation costs. Safety also sells and certainly it pays. More and 
more of our clients are focusing on safe contractors in the pre-qualification 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, where we have a vast immigrant work force, you have a 
lot of smaller industries that are basically unregulated. I was a Cal-OSHA 
inspector for five years. The conditions I saw were shocking, not much better 
than non-industrialized Third World countries. There's no excuse for it. 
</P>
<P>
 You can bet that employers who do not care for workers' well-being don't care 
how they dispose of hazardous waste that affects us all. We live in an area 
where major industries are located very close to residential neighborhoods and 
I worry about a major tragedy.

CRIME BILL: 'TOO MANY PRISONS, NOT ENOUGH PREVENTION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 KEVIN ROSS, 31, is a South Los Angeles native and deputy district attorney in 
Inglewood. He is chairman of the Political Action Committee of the Los Angeles 
chapter of the NAACP and co-hosts "People's Connection," a Sunday morning 
community talk show on 103.9 FM., with Isidra Person-Lynn. He talked with Erin 
J. Aubry about ramifications of the $30-billion crime bill passed by Congress.  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 I think the crime bill is a triumph for politicians. What they're fighting 
about has nothing to do with issues that affect individuals on a day-to-day 
basis. They're saying, "Crime is a problem, it's a priority and people want it 
to be solved." 
</P>
<P>
 The public wants it out of their lives. Ideally, they don't want to spend a 
lot of time thinking about it. When they go out to their car in the morning, 
they don't want to be attacked. They just want to be safe and they want their 
car to be there. 
</P>
<P>
 What disturbs me most about the crime bill is the disproportionate number of 
prisons that will be built, the chipping away of crime-prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 People are saying we need to focus more on locking criminals up rather than 
prevention, but it's really not either/or; it's both. Initially, crime 
prevention was a bigger part of the crime bill, but what ultimately came down 
from the House was, "OK, we'll give you some crime prevention, but we want you 
to spend a lot more than what was originally intended for more prisons and 
police." 
</P>
<P>
 I think for people who are really trying to change young people around, it's 
going to be harder. Most non-white-collar crimes, in my opinion, are being 
committed by people between 13 and 25, mostly males, and a disproportionately 
high number of them are black.  
</P>
<P>
 Midnight basketball leagues got going in Maryland because it was determined 
that most crime and gangbanging occurred at night between Thursday and Sunday. 
The leagues are great just in terms of getting guys off the street and into 
something positive. And when you're looking at $40,000 to house someone in 
jail, we need to be open to something that only requires something like a 
basketball and a court. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why I say the crime bill is really for politicians. If they were really 
interested in changing things, they would look at what's working. The number of 
people being incarcerated in proportion to the number of crimes being committed 
was going up, which suggests to me that the whole goal of deterring crime is 
not being fulfilled. If we're not succeeding there, then let's go back to crime 
prevention.  
</P>
<P>
 My biggest concern is the boys. They're lost in many respects. And what's 
happening is that girls are starting to come into their own as criminals since 
they want to be with the boys, who are committing crimes. The perception of 
crime is greater than the actual incidence of it. Roughly 70% of crime is 
drug-related or property crime -- vandalism, petty thefts, graffiti; 30% 
involve some sort of physical attack.  
</P>
<P>
 If someone has prior felony convictions, according to California's 
three-strikes law, if they're found with rock cocaine, they're sent away to 
prison. They may have been clean for 25 years, but it doesn't matter. If you 
file for a fake driver's license with the DMV, that's your third strike. And it 
costs up to $45,000 a year to imprison each one. 
</P>
<P>
 You may have an 18-year-old who's committed two felonies. He steals a car, 
which is a felony, and he's gone for life. But this is an election year. We're 
not seeing politicians talking to prosecutors, talking to judges, saying, "OK, 
here are the dynamics of what's going on: What do you think?" They're looking 
at as "What can I sell in 30 seconds?" 
</P>
<P>
 I went to talk at a juvenile camp to 125 boys in a county facility in San 
Dimas. This is the last stop before Youth Authority, which is essentially a 
state prison for people their age. One Latino guy who was 13 said he was making 
$1,000 a week before he was 12. He had his own place, he was driving. He was 
saying, "I want to turn myself around, but when I get out, I'm going right back 
to that environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, jail is a safe haven for 14-year-olds. In some ways, for some of 
these kids with prior felony convictions, having the threat of prison over 
their heads is good. But the reality is, some of these individuals can't be 
reached. Some have never had someone say to them, "If you're a man, it's not 
about strapping on a gun." Even though I was raised by a single mother, I 
always had an uncle, a friend, someone who I could look at and say to myself, 
"That's my goal; that's who I want to be like."  
</P>
<P>
 In his book "Search and Destroy: The Plight of African American Males in the 
Criminal Justice System," Dr. Jerome Miller said a study concluded that the 
odds are great that young men living in large cities will get arrested before 
the age of 25. Of that group, 51% are nonwhite. 
</P>
<P>
 When I see who is really going to be affected by provisions in the crime bill, 
I understand the dynamics of what this means for men who look like me. Many of 
these men will never experience what it's like to accomplish goals because 
they'll be incarcerated forever.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: YOUTH OPINION; A 
TALE OF TWO BROTHERS: GANG LEADER, CLASS PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID CHA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It seems only yesterday that my family first stepped on this land, America. My 
dad was going to start a church, and we came from South Korea without any 
English except "thank you," "yes" and "no." 
</P>
<P>
 It is very different now. We are nothing like the people we were nine years 
ago. My dad is a butcher, my mom is a caterer, my younger brother is a hardcore 
gangster with tattoos -- and I will enter UC San Diego next month. When I was 
graduated from high school in May, sitting on the podium as the senior-class 
president, my brother could not attend because he was locked up in a youth camp 
on parole violation. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an immigrant story of filled and unfulfilled expectations, of two 
brothers with identical heritage but divergent futures. We are foreigners in 
this land, but ours, in a way, is a completely American story. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning, my dad tried to start a church, in Ohio. It didnot work out. 
After a year, we moved to Los Angeles, where my dad knew some people whomight 
help us. My brother and I were scared of going to school because of all the 
violence we had heard about. Little did I know then that the time had come for 
my brother and me to walk the different paths of life we were destined for. 
</P>
<P>
 My dad's plan failed again in Los Angeles. He became unemployed and my mom 
returned to Korea to work and bring back enough money for the family. In her 
absence, my brother and I sold our toys to our friends to feed ourselves. When 
my dad saw this, he was moved emotionally and found work as a butcher. 
</P>
<P>
 For immigrant families, it is pretty normal for the kids to be left at home by 
themselves. While my parents were working hard at minimum wage, my brother and 
I were exposed to many things this dreamy American society had to offer, both 
the good and the bad. 
</P>
<P>
 We first got into skateboarding, which was fun. Then a new family moved in 
next door with a teen-ager a few years older than us. He began to skate with 
us. A few months later, he joined a street gang and we joined, too. To be 
honest, I loved the feeling of power that I held in my hands.  
</P>
<P>
 No one ever messed with me at school. But about a year after we joined the 
gang, my neighbor got shot. He did not die, but the stitches around his stomach 
made me think. One of my junior-high friends asked me to go to church with him. 
I went at first to check out the girls, but God reached out and saved me from 
the pit I was in. 
</P>
<P>
 The same did not happen to my brother. He did follow me to church, but after a 
few months went back to his old ways. He got into fights at school and was 
arrested many times for crimes such as car theft. His face was shown in one of 
the Korean newspapers as he sat in the back of a police car. In high school, we 
diverged further. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he is smart, and tough. He attempted to turn his life around by using 
his fighting skills in martial arts. Within just a year and a half he became a 
brown belt in Tae Kwon Do. He won medals in California and nationally, even 
taking a silver medal at the Junior Olympics. But soon he began to lose 
interest in martial arts and went back to the gang. Since then, he has covered 
his body with tattoos and been in and out of different youth camps. He is 
highly ranked in his gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever my brother was locked up, my mom was always the one bailing him out 
even though exhausted from her work -- 10 to 14 hours a day, six days a week. 
The stress of work and my brother's difficulties have caused her nerve damage. 
We had to borrow $7,000 for my freshman year of college, so money is very 
scarce in my family. Yet she still manages to laugh with us at times of joy, 
which are rare in our family. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did my brother and I take such different paths? 
</P>
<P>
 I have been taking the bus to high school in the San Fernando Valley from 
Koreatown so that I can have my education in a safer area. I was the first 
minority student elected senior class president at El Camino Real High School. 
</P>
<P>
 My brother acknowledges that he has gone wrong and he wants a high school 
diploma and a stable career. But he says he is in too deep to get out. How 
ironic, two young brothers, sons of the same mother and father and just one 
year apart in age, but so different. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet we are both good leaders, I of the senior class, he of a street gang. I 
say this not to boast of success but to let you know of the pain I have in my 
heart to see my brother the way he is.

DEATH PENALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ted Bundy is a person that deserved and received his just reward.The excerpt 
from Polly Nelson's book "Defending the Devil" (Bookmark, Aug. 21) wanted us to 
show compassion to earthworms and Bundy. Well, Ms. Nelson, I think we did both. 
One, by executing Bundy we showed compassion for the victims and their 
families. Two, putting him in the ground keeps your lowly earthworms company. 
</P>
<P>
 Capital punishment is not barbaric if it was your daughter or son that was 
murdered. I want that avenue of justice always open in capital crimes. The 
endless appeals process should also be on death row.

MEXICO ELECTION: FRAUD AROUND THE FRINGES; ZEDILLO HAS POTENTIAL TO RISE ABOVE 
THE LIMITED IRREGULARITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The final ballots from Mexico's historic elections of Aug. 21 have come into 
Mexico City from the isolated hinterlands. The rural vote did not help Ernesto 
Zedillo Ponce de Leon, candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, 
avoid the dubious distinction of being the first Mexican president in this 
century elected with less than 50% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 That will not be a point of pride for the PRI, a political machine that has 
not lost a presidential election in the 65 years since it was founded. But it 
can be a matter of pride for Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
 When the vote count was completed, Zedillo had 48.77% of the vote. Diego 
Fernandez de Cevallos of the rightist National Action Party took 25.94% and 
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party got 16.6%, 
with the balance spoiled or divided among six minor-party candidates. Zedillo's 
winning margin is the lowest ever for a PRI presidential candidate. In 1988, 
when outgoing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari defeated Cardenas in a tight 
election that many Mexicans believe was tainted by fraud, he eked out his 
controversial victory with 50.47% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 There were many impressive numbers in the Mexican election in which that 
nation can take pride -- a 77.5% voter turnout; $730 million spent by the 
Salinas administration to create an ultramodern and largely fraud-resistant 
system of voter registration and identification; more than 35,000 Mexican 
citizens and 1,000 foreign visitors dispatched to far-flung areas of the 
country to watch the voting process and attest to its honesty. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Zedillo's winning margin of 48.77% is not a number that belongs on 
that list, for it is tainted by fraud around the fringes. To cite just one of 
many troubling examples, the largest of the Mexican observer groups, a 
coalition of prominent citizens dubbed the Civic Alliance, reported that in 34% 
of the precincts its observers visited, ballots were not cast in secret. In 
rural areas of Mexico, especially, that leaves open the possibility that voters 
would have been subject to retaliation by local political bosses if they did 
not vote the "right" way.  
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the Civic Alliance and most other independent election observers 
agree with the assessment of James Jones, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, that 
there was not enough fraud or voter intimidation to discredit Zedillo's 
victory. But enough voting irregularities were reported to pose a challenge to 
Zedillo, who pledged during his campaign to eliminate such blatant official 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 If he does nothing else in his six-year term but end corruption, Mexicans 
would regard Zedillo as a great president. Most Mexicans -- and the many 
foreigners who care about that nation -- fervently hope that Zedillo will be 
able to rise above these voting irregularities to become just that -- as his 
predecessor, Salinas, was able to. In moving toward that goal, it would be well 
for Zedillo to remember that many great and widely admired political leaders, 
from Abraham Lincoln to Margaret Thatcher, did not get more than 50% of the 
vote in winning public office.

ALL HAIL THE BOYS OF SUMMER; NORTHRIDGE LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM REPRESENTED A 
COMMUNITY, AND A NATION, SO VERY WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the end, it wasn't to be. The boys from Northridge, who also happened to be 
representing all of the United States in a dramatic final game of the Little 
League World Series on Saturday, were defeated by a team from Maracaibo, 
Venezuela, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge wound up battling not just a tough opponent but miserable weather, 
including a thunderstorm that delayed the game for three hours. "The rain 
really got us," shortstop Matt Fisher said later. "We had the momentum, but 
after we stopped, they scored right away and turned it around." 
</P>
<P>
 But this is one case in which the losing team came away with more than the 
proverbial honor in defeat. It can also look back with great pride. For this is 
one group of young athletes you just know is going to bounce back from 
adversity. After what they and their families have already been through this 
year, a loss even in a big game is easy to keep in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 For, as the entire nation now knows, this is a team that came together on the 
Little League fields of the northern San Fernando Valley just weeks after the 
most devastating earthquake to hit Southern California in a generation rumbled 
through its community. Many of the players on the Northridge team were 
dislocated from their homes by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. One has yet 
to return to his former home. That is why so many people throughout Los Angeles 
invested so much hope in the Earthquake Kids, as they came to be called. Their 
ability to play hard and play well despite some awesome distractions were an 
inspiration to an entire region. 
</P>
<P>
 What also made the Northridge team special to fans outside Southern California 
this year was the fact that they reminded us all of the sheer joy of baseball 
in a summer when the major league version of the game has been shut down by a 
prolonged strike that shows no sign of ending soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball fans hope not, but the Little League World Series may be the only 
World Series to be played as the 1994 season winds down. But what better way to 
revel in the youthful innocence of the American pastime than to have the nation 
rooting for a group of boys playing the game for the fun of it? 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge and the rest of Los Angeles took quite a hit back in January. But 
they bounced back, and the Northridge Little League team is an apt symbol of 
the talent, grit and determination that helped accomplish the task. No matter 
the final score, they are winners in our book and we are proud of them.

A PROMISING REFORM FOR STATE SUPERFUND; BECAUSE OF ITS SIGNIFICANCE, 
TOXIC-CLEANUP BILL MUST NOT BE RUSHED INTO LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Few who have had a hand in trying to clean up any of the 8,000 or so toxic 
waste sites on California's Superfund list would dispute that the laws 
governing that process could stand improvement. The effort has been slow, 
incredibly costly and characterized by bitter and protracted legal battles. In 
short, the state program has the same systemic problems that plague the 
managers of the federal Superfund list -- 1,200 sites that generally pose an 
even greater danger to public health than those on the state list. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that reform is manifestly needed, is a new law the answer? Senate Bill 
923, which already has passed the Senate and is now moving rapidly through the 
Assembly, is designed to expedite cleanup at 30 state sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation, proposed by Sen. Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier), would 
create a narrowly circumscribed model or pilot program in California, 
significantly streamline and expedite the cleanup process at the 30 locations 
and permit greater latitude in the cleanup standards to be met. 
</P>
<P>
 Like proposed federal reforms, this bill would not require that all sites be 
clean enough to be used for new housing subdivisions or schools. Sites where 
the next likely use was, say, an industrial facility could be cleaned to a less 
rigid standard. Of course, adhering to less exacting standards would also limit 
the future uses of the properties involved and perhaps their long-range 
profitability.  
</P>
<P>
 Arguably, SB 923 would do little more than make it easier to clean up those 
state Superfund sites that were, because of the nature and extent of the 
pollution there, already easy to detoxify. Sites could be part of this model 
program only if all parties responsible for cleanup agreed or if interested 
parties agreed to pay the cleanup shares of parties unwilling to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 There are strong incentives for participation: Once the parties agreed on 
shares of liability, arbitrators would decide a host of technical issues 
including the appropriate remedial action. No doubt this process would work 
much more quickly and efficiently than the endless, acrimonious litigation 
through which these decisions now are made. The rules would also allow property 
owners to put cleaned portions of sites back into productive use. 
</P>
<P>
 Is a narrowly defined experiment such as this worth a try? Yes, but the bill's 
complexity and the wholesale revisions made to it in recent weeks give us 
pause. Many view the measure as a template for future state and federal 
Superfund reform. Accordingly, lawmakers need time for a careful review of the 
amended language at the beginning of the next legislative session, rather than 
rushing it through now.

HUFFINGTON'S SENATE CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Huffington on Defensive in Key Goal of Eluding Welfare," Aug. 19: 
</P>
<P>
 Republican candidate Mike Huffington's plan to replace welfare with private 
philanthropy is emblematic of his U.S. Senate campaign as a whole -- vacuous 
and cynical. The facts that Huffington does not even know the cost of the very 
welfare system he would abolish and that his own record of "volunteerism" only 
began after he entered the Senate race prove that he has no credibility 
whatsoever on this, the so-called "central theme" of his candidacy. Even more 
laughable is the notion that this proposal is what motivated Huffington's 
Senate bid, rather than the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from barraging voters with a multimillion-dollar blitz of negative 
television commercials, the only other talent Huffington has revealed is the 
ability to propose flaky, empty-headed legislation that has no realistic chance 
of ever becoming law. California's choice in November could not be clearer. We 
can either reelect Dianne Feinstein, one of the most productive and effective 
first-term senators in recent history, or take our chances with "Senator 
Nothington."

 * I read your article "Huffington Ad Calls for an End to Welfare" (Aug. 5) 
with amazement. Finally a leader is trying new and innovative ideas to end the 
welfare state.  
</P>
<P>
 Huffington donates his salary to charity while his opponent, who is worth 
something like $50 million, keeps her taxpayer-financed salary. Hats off to 
Huffington for backing up what he believes in with his own money. Huffington's 
got my vote!

 * I did not read Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington's book "The Fourth 
Instinct." However, I understand it explains how doing wondrous deeds makes one 
feel warm all over. Mike (formerly Michael, formerly Texan) Huffington wants to 
assure that his friends never feel cold and to that end he wants the federal 
government to allow unlimited tax deductions for charitable contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where it pays to have some religious education. Remember the story of 
the Good Samaritan. It teaches that charitable acts should be unheralded, 
unrecognized and unclaimed (as to Form 1040 Schedule A), and done more often 
than in election years.  
</P>
<P>
 So to make the Huffingtons and their friends feel warm all over they should 
donate their time without press releases and photo ops (even on bad hair days), 
and forgo the tax deductions. Now, that's hot.

<P>
 I was extremely disappointed to find that The Times has taken to devoting part 
of its Opinion section -- on the front page, no less -- to a rehashing of stale 
gossip. Stephen Games' piece was nothing more than a warmed-over compendium of 
rumors and distortions. 
</P>

 It is absolutely astounding that you would devote such time and space to what 
amounts to little more than a glorified tabloid column about the spouse of a 
Senate candidate. If it is your new editorial policy to titillate those who 
turn to the respected Opinion pages with old news of weddings and wardrobes, 
readers with inquiring minds might well turn to the supermarket newsstands 
instead.

 For the record: Games characterizes a speech I delivered on Aug. 4 as a 
"dining club address" at the Biltmore Hotel. It was, in fact, a Town Hall 
meeting attended by government, civic and business leaders -- but an active 
citizenry hungry for informed debate and fresh ideas. Then there's an 
outrageous statement from a "member of Dianne Feinstein's staff," that Mike and 
I have proposed "out-of-body experiences, walking on coals and buying crystals 
as a way to solve problems." The staffer, whoever it was, must have had an 
out-of-mind experience when he/she concocted this despicable quote.  
</P>
<P>
 Any conscientious editor would have required Games to back up such anonymous 
bile with hard facts. Yet you let Games get away with it. Games is no impartial 
journalist, but a former Green Party candidate in England in 1992 with a 
left-wing platform all his own. His aim has little to do with informing readers 
and digging up facts. It is, rather, to distract, deceive and distort the truth 
to fit his personal and political agenda.

 * The Times has carried numerous articles on the California Senate race, but 
we only hear about two candidates -- Feinstein and Huffington. I do not feel 
comfortable supporting either of these candidates. Earlier this year over a 
million California voters signed petitions to put the Single Payer Health Care 
initiative on the ballot. Neither Feinstein nor Huffington is a supporter of 
this initiative, but at least two of the other candidates (Barbara Blong of the 
Green Party and Elizabeth Barron of the Peace and Freedom Party) are active 
supporters.

 It is important to the democratic process to consider as many different points 
of view as possible.

<TEXT>

 * I found Bill Robertson's (letter, Aug. 14) attack on Eric Mann's Aug. 4 
Column Left interesting but predictable. Interesting because Robertson 
denigrates The Times for even running Mann's article. Although Robertson has 
been an enthusiastic proponent of the free market system, he seems to draw the 
line at a free market of ideas, especially when those ideas diverge from 
typical Establishment opinion. I am familiar with Mann's work since 1982 when 
he worked on the GM assembly line in Van Nuys and was the UAW coordinator of 
the Campaign to Keep GM Van Nuys Open. 
</P>
<P>
 That campaign, unafraid to acknowledge the "class struggle" which seems to 
frighten Robertson, built a large worker-community-civil rights coalition to 
defend the multiracial but predominantly Latino work force against GM's plans 
to shut the plant down. This struggle was one of labor's few bright spots 
during the Reagan '80s, and succeeded in keeping the plant open for a full 
decade. In fact the issue was lost only when the "class struggle" politics that 
Robertson hates so much gave way to the "labor-management cooperation" policies 
of the AFL-CIO and the UAW International. Labor cooperated by making major 
concessions to GM. The company cooperated by closing down the plant in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of this history, it is rather ludicrous for Robertson to deride Mann 
and the Strategy Center for criticizing the leadership of the transit unions 
for failing to wholeheartedly support low-income communities that are fighting 
against fare increases and cuts in bus service. Mann correctly points out that 
the union's shortsightedness and narrow self-interest resulted in major losses 
for their workers. Of course, Robertson has every right to disagree with Mann's 
ideas. Robertson and the labor Establishment should stop and consider what will 
once again make the labor movement relevant: welcoming pro-union innovators 
like Mann, or futilely seeking friendship with GM and the MTA.

SUBWAY TUNNELING

<P>
 * Regarding the collapse of Hollywood Boulevard (Aug. 23): Why are we building 
a subway system in Los Angeles? We have unstable ground and pockets of natural 
gas. And now it seems we have underground water, which is damaging the tunnels 
and areas aboveground.Who would want to ride on a subway built in this kind of 
environment? 
</P>
<P>
 As we all know, the people who live in Los Angeles are automobile people. For 
this reason we have an excellent system of roads and freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Why don't we use what we have, the roads and freeways, for mass transit? We 
would just need new equipment, and we would not have to tear up our city. And 
we would save lots of money. I do not believe we will get Angelenos to use mass 
transit unless it is surface transportation.

 Denigrating cynicism has lately become a favorite Washington pastime. Bill 
Clinton is accusing talk-show hosts of spreading it. Hillary is blaming 
Republicans for using it to defeat health care, and Al Gore has warned Harvard 
graduates that it "withers the soul." 
</P>
<P>
 A healthy dose of cynicism is good for the soul. The most publicly damaging 
attitude is the cloying, phony, "Isn't everything ducky?" approach. Who are 
they kidding? Optimists are the ones who breed cynics. They promise so much 
that when things fall short, cynics pick up the slack. What the Administration 
doesn't seem to understand is that cynics are really disillusioned optimists -- 
disillusioned because things are not going well. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what we face: crime out of control, babies out of wedlock, job-seekers 
out of luck. The House post office scandal, nuclear threat in North Korea, 
genocide in Bosnia. Then there's Watergate, Whitewatergate, Nannygate, 
Bimbogate. Only someone hooked up to a Valium IV could easily remain an 
optimist. 
</P>
<P>
 We need cynics; they keep us honest. They ask why, how, when. Cynics may 
dampen spirits a bit, but they fertilize the mind because they make us think. 
Cynics force dreamers to focus, to plan and to explain. They ground the flighty 
and reward the prudent.  
</P>
<P>
 Like good health care, cynicism is preventive. It prepares us for the worst so 
it will be more palatable if it happens.

DON'T REPEAT HAITI ERRORS IN CUBA; FOREIGN POLICY: IT'S A MISTAKE TO LET 
DOMESTIC POLITICS FORCE A HASTY STRATEGY THAT BECOMES 'DEMOCRACY BY 
STARVATION.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS CAROTHERS, Thomas Carothers is a senior associate at the Carnegie 
Endowment for International Peace and the author of In the Name of Democracy: 
U.S. Policy Toward Latin America in the Reagan Years (University of California 
Press, 1993). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the impasse in Haiti still unresolved, the Clinton Administration now 
finds itself confronted with yet another crisis in the Caribbean, again 
involving refugees and the vexing question of how to promote democratic change 
against the wishes of an entrenched dictatorial leadership. Cuba is obviously 
different from Haiti in numerous, profound ways; however, there are enough 
similarities in the policy challenges presented by the two countries that 
Clinton policy-makers should take care not to replay in Cuba the mistakes that 
have dogged the Administration's Haiti policy. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the Administration should not base its policy on the views and desires 
of one interested domestic constituency. In both Haiti and Cuba, the 
Administration is driven to try to effect internal political change in 
significant measure by domestic constituencies of perceived political 
importance to the Administration. Yet these same constituencies, the 
Congressional Black Caucus and the Cuban American community, effectively 
restrict the policy approaches that the Administration may employ. 
</P>
<P>
 With respect to Haiti, the Administration has been almost morbidly sensitive 
to the views of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's U.S. supporters and 
hews to a strict pro-Aristide line. This approach greatly reduces the 
Administration's ability to bring about a resolution of the impasse and has led 
the Administration to the point where the only alternative to its unsuccessful 
policy appears to be a military intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward Cuba, the Administration has up to now deferred to the conservative 
forces in the Cuban American community and pursued a single-track, punitive 
policy. As the Administration revisits U.S. policy toward Cuba in the current 
crisis, it should acknowledge that sticking to a policy primarily constructed 
to please one highly interested domestic group is a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti has vividly demonstrated that trying to force stubborn strongmen out of 
power through economic sanctions is an uncertain approach that can cause great 
harm to average people without any political result. Haiti initially appeared 
to be a good target for such an approach, much better than Cuba, in that its 
military leaders have few reserves of popularity and its economy was heavily 
dependent on the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the Clinton Administration really wants democracy by starvation to be 
its main policy legacy in the Western Hemisphere, it should respond to the 
current crisis in U.S.-Cuban relations by developing policy alternatives other 
than the reflexive imposition of still further economic sanctions. More 
positive and nuanced measures should be considered, including the initiation of 
negotiations in which the United States would consider lifting parts of the 
long-standing embargo against Cuba in return for concrete measures of political 
liberalization by Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration should be careful about over-escalating the war of 
words with Castro and placing too much emphasis on what is essentially a 
situation in which, apart from the refugee issue, no major U.S. interests are 
at stake. One of the most unfortunate features of the Haiti policy is that so 
much of the damage to the Administration has been self-inflicted. The 
Administration must keep a sense of proportion between the real significance of 
the crises it faces and the magnitude of its emotional and rhetorical 
engagement. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti has made clear that in a confrontation with a Caribbean strongman, it is 
surprisingly easy for the U.S. government to come away the humiliated party, 
despite the monumental power differential in America's favor. This occurs in 
part because of the difference in goals: All that the strongman seeks is a 
maintenance of the status quo, whereas the U.S. goal is a fundamental 
reordering of local power structures, a far more difficult task. It also has to 
do with the relative amounts of will. For the local strongman and his cronies, 
defiance is often a matter of personal survival; their will tends to be quite 
strong. For the U.S. policy-makers, the cause is only one of dozens of 
competing claims on their time; their will tends to be diluted. 
</P>
<P>
 When large, unexpected refugee flows are driving a policy crisis, the 
Administration must make special efforts to avoid the perception or reality of 
a reactive, inconsistent policy. Refugee flows from a nearby country can wax 
and wane with startling speed and unpredictability. The emotions they provoke 
in the United States are intense. Policy responses require weighing a thicket 
of factors, ranging from the availability of shelter sites and the cooperation 
of third parties to the tide of U.S. public opinion and the web of legal 
obligations under U.S. and international law. 
</P>
<P>
 It is essential that the Administration hold firmly to the new refugee policy 
it has set out, to persuade Cubans who are considering getting on boats that 
they really will not be allowed into the United States. Haitians were fairly 
quickly convinced this summer that those fleeing would no longer be able to get 
into the United States. With such a long history of guaranteed asylum in the 
United States, Cubans will take longer to convince that they no longer can get 
in. But if the Administration is forceful, consistent and patient on this 
issue, Cubans may eventually get the message. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuba and Haiti are very different countries. But if the Clinton Administration 
is to avoid a prolonged season of Caribbean discontents, it should extract from 
its frustrating efforts in Haiti the lessons that will help it avoid similar 
mistakes in the current crisis over U.S.-Cuban relations.

CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY; THE 'EARTHQUAKE CRISIS' IS AN INSURANCE HOAX; THE COURT 
HAS ENSURED THAT PROP. 103 WILL KEEP COMPANIES FROM EXPLOITING DISASTERS TO GET 
UNJUSTIFIED RATE HIKES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARVEY ROSENFIELD, Harvey Rosenfield, the author of Proposition 103, is 
director of the Proposition 103 Enforcement Project. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court's unanimous ruling on Proposition 103 means much 
more to consumers than the long-delayed payment of $1.5 billion in premium 
rollbacks. By upholding the insurance commissioner's authority to limit the 
profits and expenses of insurance companies, the decision enforces 103's 
provisions protecting California consumers against industry greed and abuse in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing better illustrates the importance of these Proposition 103 protections 
than the looming confrontation between consumers and insurance companies over 
the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, State Farm, Farmers and Allstate, which collectively control about 
60% of the California market for homeowners' insurance, predicted an "insurance 
crisis." Unhappy that they will have to pay out about $4 billion in claims from 
the January quake, the companies (whose assets total more than $90 billion) 
complained, remarkably, that they never anticipated such a disaster. And, they 
said, they could no longer insure against future earthquakes. The carriers then 
made their announcement a self-fulfilling prophecy by halting or restricting 
the sale of new homeowners' and earthquake policies. Many current policyholders 
have had their coverage canceled. Dozens of other insurance companies have 
followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies' demands? They want state law to be changed to relieve them of 
the responsibility to offer earthquake insurance with homeowners' policies. 
They want legislators to establish a taxpayer or policyholder subsidized 
"insurance pool" that would provide earthquake coverage. Insurance companies 
would sell the policies at a profit but take none of the risk. And they want 
immediate rate increases for homeowner as well as earthquake policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, insurance companies fabricated a similar crisis, blaming what 
they claimed was an "explosion" in lawsuits. The companies sharply limited the 
availability of business, municipal and auto liability policies, which led to 
huge premium increases. Independent studies showed there was no surge in 
litigation. But California's insurance regulators -- political appointees 
beholden to the industry -- had neither the power nor the desire to restrain 
the industry. Legislators quickly passed laws to limit how much compensation 
insurers would have to pay under their liability policies, and the "crisis" 
abruptly ended -- with skyrocketing profits for insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the "liability crisis" of the 1980s, today's "earthquake crisis" is a 
hoax concocted by the industry to mask dwindling profits. When interest rates 
are low and the stock market is down, as they are today, the insurers' 
investment income declines and companies look for an excuse to raise rates in 
order to maintain their bloated profits. Natural disasters are the perfect 
foil, and insurers have no compunctions about exploiting the public's misery 
for private gain. On the August, 1992, morning that Hurricane Andrew hit the 
Florida coast with deadly force, a top executive of the world's largest 
insurer, American International Companies, circulated a memo to company 
executives that "this is an opportunity to get price increases now . . . get it 
moving today." The same greed, not the Northridge temblor, motivates the 
industry's present actions.  
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, California consumers were powerless to protect themselves 
against such brazen mistreatment, but not today. It was the devastating 
economic impact of the last "crisis" that led voters to enact Proposition 103 
in 1988.  
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 103 gives an elected insurance commissioner the power to alleviate 
shortages by forcing companies in the state to sell the coverage. And the 
initiative requires every insurer to open its books to prove that rate 
increases are justified. This will be hard to do for many companies, which made 
enormous profits selling homeowner and earthquake coverage for the 23 years 
between the 1971 Sylmar quake and this year's Northridge temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for example, Woodland Hills-based 20th Century Insurance Co., the 
hardest hit of any insurer in the state. Its practice of "cream skimming" -- 
avoiding all but the best risks -- made huge profits for its shareholders. In 
1991, the company defied the commissioner's order to roll back its rates under 
103, disputing voters' right to regulate its premiums. But the company's 
over-concentration of lucrative San Fernando Valley customers proved to be a 
financial disaster after the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi acted quickly to assist the depleted 
company, giving it a 17% increase in homeowners' rates in June. But now 20th 
Century wants its auto insurance policyholders to pay an otherwise unjustified 
9.2% increase to bring the company's capital to secure levels -- with no 
requirement that the policyholders be reimbursed, with interest, for being 
forced to invest in the company. An audacious proposal, considering the company 
reported a profit for the second quarter. Our lawyers have urged Garamendi to 
reject any plan that does not include full reimbursement of the policyholders, 
as well as payment of $119 million in rollbacks, before shareholders begin to 
earn profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulatory actions, authorized by 103, also have blocked $6 billion in rate 
increases since 1988. Auto-insurance premiums have dropped in California, while 
the rest of the nation's have risen an average of 20%. California used to have 
the seventh fastest-growing auto rates in the nation. Now it ranks 48th. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Supreme Court's decision upholding Garamendi's stringent rate controls 
means that future commissioners will be able to deliver similar savings. 
</P>
<P>
 For six years, the insurance industry spent more than $200 million trying to 
block every part of Proposition 103 in the courts, hoping that the public would 
eventually give up. They were wrong. The Supreme Court's decision is a 
vindication not only of 103, but also of the people's control over democracy.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MAKING A DIFFERENCE; 
AID TO GARDENERS NURTURES SEEDS OF COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The flavor of a tomato picked ripe off the vine may be reason enough to take 
part in an urban community garden. But they also save money, improve family 
nutrition, strengthen social ties in neighborhoods and can transform blighted 
vacant lots. Gardens don't thrive on good will alone, however. Periodic 
technical and financial support can be essential, especially in low-income 
areas. Gardeners may need assistance replacing depleted or toxic soil, for 
example, or repairing a fence or negotiating with a property owner to keep 
their garden space. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Asian Consortium in Employment, a job training and service 
organization involved with community gardening since 1983, has improved gardens 
in Watts, South Central Los Angeles and the Pico Union/Koreatown areas over the 
past three years. The consortium launched two new community gardens, restored 
another and made modest improvements to 15 using funds from a federal grant 
program established by the U.S. Deparment of Agriculture and Forest Service 
after the civil unrest in 1992. The program is administered by L.A. Harvest, a 
group that coordinates financial and material resources to improve the urban 
environment. A VOICE OF EXPERIENCE 
</P>
<P>
 People would like community gardens to happen overnight, but it can take 18 
months to three years to help a group grow crops, run meetings, resolve 
problems that can come up when you create a neighborhood garden.  
</P>
<P>
 Community gardens require community resources to last. It takes involved 
government. It takes groups like the LA Conservation Corps and groups that are 
excellent at the on-the-ground installation of gardening projects like PACE. It 
takes a network of people and organizations who support gardening and greening 
projects throughout Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Is community gardening an anti-hunger tool? an economic or community 
development tool? It can be all of these. -Brenda Funches, emeritus Cooperative 
Extension advisor, UC-Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources and former 
managing advisor of the venerable Common Ground Garden Program, a training and 
technical assistance provider for community gardeners and community gardening 
organizations HOW TO CREATE A COMMUNITY GARDEN 
</P>
<P>
 Organizations such as PACE help gardeners to: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Locate vacant lots with adequate sunlight, soil and access to water and 
negotiate with land owner to use property. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Collaborate with neighborhood nurseries and community groups to provide 
soil, raised beds or containers, fencing, signs, tools and labor to prepare the 
garden site. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Help organize a garden club to manage the site and raise money for water 
and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Coordinate workshops to train club members on garden designs, seed 
selection, plants, irrigation and pest control techniques. TO GET INVOLVED

THE SADNESS LINGERS; CRASH: TRAGEDY IN WHICH THREE DIED ALSO LEFT TEEN-AGER SO 
BADLY INJURED SHE REQUIRES FULL-TIME CARE.

<P>
 By some miracle, Barbara Du Bois, 14, survived the tragic traffic accident in 
which her sister, another teen-ager and a toddler died, but her grandmother 
said the cheerful girl she once knew no longer exists. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the June 1 accident, the Canyon Country teen-ager had typical 
adolescent ambitions of being a model or a movie star, said Mary McWilliams, 
her grandmother and guardian. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Barbara will require full-time care for the rest of her life because 
her physical injuries were so severe, doctors predict. 
</P>
<P>
 The brain damage she suffered will remain with her for life. Doctors say she 
will never be able to function above the level of a 10- to 12-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 "She doesn't comprehend any part of that," McWilliams said. "She doesn't even 
know about the accident yet." 
</P>

 The tragic accident consumes the lives of the four families whose young girls 
were in the car that night. In some cases, there are hard feelings on the part 
of family members who believe the accident could have been avoided. In other 
cases, relationships have been formed or strengthened. The sadness lingers 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The five girls in the car that night were returning from a youth group meeting 
at their Saugus church when the car collided head-on with two vehicles on Seco 
Canyon Road. The driver, Barbara's 15-year-old sister, JoKema, reportedly was 
weaving her grandmother's car back and forth to amuse Jesika Noell, 3, and it 
drifted across the road's center line. 
</P>
<P>
 McWilliams said JoKema, who was not licensed to drive, took the car keys 
without her knowledge. Family members of some of the girls who were in the car 
privately dispute that claim, but stop short of condemning McWilliams because 
there is little substance on which to base their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 Killed with JoKema and Jesika was Gena Watkinson, 15. Alicia Acevedo, 14, and 
Barbara were hospitalized in critical condition. Alicia's condition improved 
relatively quickly and she was released from the hospital about a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara was given only a 10% chance to live. But she has defied the odds. 
</P>
<P>
 McWilliams said she watches her granddaughter go through hours of therapy 
daily at Northridge Hospital Medical Center to help her eat, write, stand, 
speak and use her severely injured left hand. She hopes doctors' predictions 
will once again be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't ever expect her to recover fully," she said. "My own personal gut 
feeling is she will recover enough to be able to live a fairly normal life. By 
that I mean she'll get into her 20s and just be slow." 
</P>
<P>
 In a tragic turn of events, McWilliams' ex-husband, Malcom, who was reportedly 
despondent over what happened to his granddaughters, fired a warning shot 
earlier this month at two 14-year-old boys who reportedly were trying to steal 
his car, killing a third 14-year-old youth he did not see. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they arrested the wheelchair-bound Malcom McWilliams, authorities 
said the man's intent was to warn the youths about the dangers of joyriding. 
They later announced they will not file charges against McWilliams. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, hospital officials expect Barbara to remain at the hospital until 
the beginning of December. But she won't be going home then. Her grandmother 
was evicted from her Canyon Country house after failing to make the mortgage 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 McWilliams, now living alone in a relative's motor home in an Elks Lodge 
campground, said financial troubles before the accident led to the eviction and 
that her granddaughters were aware of her plans to move to Arizona or Colorado. 
Now, she said, she is unsure of what she will do, since she has to work and 
won't be able to provide the constant care Barbara will require. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like I'm 35 now, so I know I'm not going to be able to do that 
alone," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia, a close friend of Barbara's, also is receiving physical therapy at the 
Northridge hospital for a broken leg. Her therapy is expected to last several 
more months, said her 16-year-old brother, Angel. She usually stays at the 
hospital after her own therapy sessions to be with Barbara during hers, her 
brother said. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel said the family talks about the accident and that his sister is 
sometimes depressed about it. But she has been able to resume a normal life, he 
said. "We tell her to try not to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Life will never return to normal for Jesika's mother, Jamie Noell, who has a 
congenital spinal disease and is confined to a wheelchair. She rented a room at 
McWilliams' house for more than a year until the accident. After that, she 
moved in with relatives in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed family with me and I was very, very distraught," Noell said. "I just 
could not go back into that house because I cared very deeply about Jesika, 
obviously, but also about (McWilliams') two girls. There would just be too many 
memories in that house." 
</P>
<P>
 She is divorced from Jesika's father, Stephen, who lives in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Noell said she used to spend her days caring for her daughter and her evenings 
painting ceramics she hoped to sell. Now, she spends most of her time thinking 
about Jesika and what to do with the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The little girl's memory remains at Bethlehem Lutheran Preschool, where her 
classmates play in a sandbox built by Jesika's uncle, Lonnie Bernal. The box is 
filled with sand provided by a local gravel company. Her mother said the family 
came up with the idea because of Jesika's comments the first day she attended 
the preschool. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said she had fun, but she had one complaint . . . they don't have a 
sandbox," her mother said. "I said, 'They have sand there,' and she said, 'They 
have sand there, but it's on the ground. I want a sandbox.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A similar gesture for Gena Watkinson was made by the High Desert Horseman's 
Assn., to which she belonged. The organization will present an annual award in 
Gena's name to its "most tenacious rider." 
</P>
<P>
 Her grandmother and legal guardian, Sandra Watkinson, said the award's 
designation is for a remembrance of Gena. "She didn't always win, but she was 
always trying," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The memory of Gena's death brings tears to her grandmother's eyes. Watkinson 
said that part of the pain is because "the whole situation was so needless." 
</P>
<P>
 "I go up to the cemetery at least a couple of times a week and it still 
hurts," she said. "I think the thing that hurts the most is that we never know 
what she could have been. She'll be forever 15."
