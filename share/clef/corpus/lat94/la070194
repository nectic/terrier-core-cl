ART REVIEW; NOTHING LIKE A LITTLE ENLIGHTENED IMPURITY; A MID-CAREER SURVEY OF 
MIKE KELLEY'S WORK UNDERSCORES THE ARTIST'S SCATHINGLY FUNNY AND INSIGHTFUL 
TOUCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Never have the ground-floor galleries of the Anderson Building at the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art looked more beautiful than they do right now, 
hosting the touring exhibition of Mike Kelley's fiercely intelligent, often 
ferociously witty art. At its debut last fall at New York's Whitney Museum of 
American Art, where the mid-career survey was organized, the show looked first 
rate. It looks even better here. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason is simply that the nearly 200 drawings, sculptures and 
installations have been presented with impeccable care in a sequence of rooms 
that maintains a high level of interest from beginning to end. With the 
exception of two sculptures that employ recorded sound, unfortunately placed in 
adjacent galleries that make for some dissonant cacophony, you'd be hard 
pressed to fault the elegant and informative mechanics of the display. 
</P>
<P>
 More to the point, though, is that Kelley, who is based in Los Angeles, has 
shown in this city almost every season since his memorable solo debut in 1981, 
and often with exhibitions that rose far above the usual gallery fare. The 
LACMA survey, which opened Thursday, offers a joyful opportunity to revisit a 
good deal of that older work; to draw connections among disparate bodies of 
work produced during the last 15 years and, in some instances, to discover work 
that hasn't been shown here before. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley is an avatar of the power and humanity inherent in recognizing the 
radical impurity of human experience. His art searches out dark and soiled 
places where defects, fault lines and inadequacies are obvious and routine, and 
where failure takes on the poignant, fragile, even heartbreaking beauty that 
accompanies any loss of self. 
</P>
<P>
 He finds evidence of that bittersweet condition throughout American culture. 
Remember Sad Sack, the hapless Army private of comic book fame? At some 
inevitable point in a Sad Sack narrative, the dedicated grunt would typically 
wind up face down in a garbage dump or, worse, a latrine, suffering yet another 
in a seemingly endless sequence of daily degradations. Kelley, in an extensive 
series of ink drawings derived from these squalid tales, renders the flying 
swill in gestures as graceful, fluid and balletic as an Abstract Expressionist 
painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointedly, the pictures leave out any representation of a human figure. In 
these "Garbage Drawings," an absent self is surrounded by the radiant 
choreography of used tin cans and old banana peels. 
</P>
<P>
 Abstract Expressionist painting's down-and-dirty liveliness, long since 
drained away in its elevation to the pristine heights of our cultural pantheon, 
is cleverly restored. Simultaneously, the drawings acknowledge that an 
apparently bottomless pit of degradation yields the renewable fossil fuel that 
runs the modern machinery of mass culture. 
</P>
<P>
 In plangent ways, Kelley's work regularly mixes up common categories of High 
Culture and Low. The aim is not to bring one down or shore the other up, as 
much as to suggest that both create their own uniquely imprisoning boundaries. 
Each pretends to characterize normalcy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, drawing on his own working-class Catholic background, the 
40-year-old artist often performs a similar amalgamation of High Church and 
Low. A series of brightly colored banners describes feel-good homilies in the 
cheery style of Sister Corita, while dark, existentially tinged references to 
the satanic theatrics of heavy metal music abound. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley's assault on cultural purity, high or low, is frequently leavened with 
sometimes bawdy, always sly humor. A work called "Citrus and White" consists of 
two lumpy spheres made from clusters of grungy, used stuffed animals and plush 
toys, suspended on cords before two plastic wall sculptures, geometric, 
pristine and Minimalist in bearing. The faux -Minimalist sculptures are 
actually giant room-deodorizers, which periodically spray clouds of lemon-fresh 
disinfectant in the general direction of the soiled, Pop love-tokens. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, a hand-crocheted afghan of orange wool, spread out on the floor, 
features a row of stuffed dachshunds -- "autograph hounds," once beloved of 
teen-age girls with rock 'n' roll crushes and lately retrieved by Kelley from 
the discard bins of area thrift shops -- all lined up along a single brown 
stripe down the middle of the blanket. The doggy pun implied between an afghan 
and an autograph hound is compounded by the blanket's goofy imitation of a 
Barnett Newman stripe painting, which constitutes that artist's "signature" 
style. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley's art is unusual in its eager embrace of symbols of adolescence with 
which to conduct intellectual discourse. Indeed, his detractors typically point 
to his affection for scatalogical humor, metal-head music, tales of teen-age 
sex, stuffed animals, coarse language and the rest as collectively indicative 
of an appalling absence of artistic maturity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But adolescence is, in fact, among the most significant inventions of the 
modern world. Unknown before our time, it embodies a social dynamic almost 
completely ignored by visual artists. Wedged between the supposed innocence of 
childhood and the normative maturity of an adult universe -- both conditions 
that have been regularly plumbed by modern artists -- this neglected, 
betwixt-and-between period turns out to be a perfect vehicle to drive home 
Kelley's anti-purist vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Near as I can tell, Kelley's burlesque renunciation of aesthetic purity is 
just about the most thoroughly effective assault on postwar formalist doctrine 
yet achieved by an artist. Formalism, which regards aesthetic purity as art's 
highest value, has been the target of repeated fusillades for nearly 30 years. 
However, its attackers have almost always missed the bull's-eye: They've 
labored to banish aesthetics from artistic consideration, when the problem has 
not been aesthetics at all, but the demand for aesthetic purity.  
</P>
<P>
 Kelley's resonant and insightful work dramatically reorients priorities. By 
elevating radical impurity to a position of aesthetic prominence, this 
scathingly funny, deeply moral art generates a liberating sense of individual 
and collective pleasure.

MOVIE REVIEWS; 'THE SHADOW': THE LOOK SAYS IT ALL; EXCITING VISUALS HELP BRING 
FILM TO LIFE, BUT ABLE ACTORS CAN'T MAKE THE WRITING RIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his six decades as a bulwark against evil, a certain high-profile crime 
fighter has survived confrontations with the Red Blot and the Gray Fist, the 
Condor and the Cobra, the Vindicator, the Voodoo Master and the Silent Seven. 
After all that, surviving "The Shadow," the film that carries his name, 
shouldn't be too difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, there are times when this action-adventure starring Alec Baldwin as 
the man with the all-knowing laugh seems on its way to not only surviving but 
also prospering. Set largely in a mythical, dreamlike New York between the 
wars, it has the benefit of a combination of gorgeous production design (by 
Joseph Nemec III) and eye-catching visual effects (supervised by Alison 
Savitch). If ever a film looked exactly the way you hoped and imagined it 
would, "The Shadow" is it. 
</P>
<P>
 But if ever a film made you wince whenever its actors opened their mouths, 
"The Shadow" is that as well. Determined to follow the treacherous 
tongue-in-cheek path of the glib "Batman" movies, "The Shadow" winks 
strenuously and continuously at the audience, forcing its cast to struggle with 
the flat witticisms that litter David Koepp's script like so many expired 
balloons. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the early 1930s and the mid-1950s, the Shadow was a respected fixture 
on the American popular culture scene. A pulp magazine detailed his exploits 
for 18 years, a radio program (that briefly starred Orson Welles) did the same 
for more than 20, and there was exposure in feature films, comic books and even 
board games. 
</P>
<P>
 The key figure in all of this was the hard-working Walter Gibson, who under 
the pen name Maxwell Grant wrote 283 Shadow novels totaling something like 15 
million words. Although he is mentioned only at the tail end of an extended 
credits crawl, it was Gibson who thought up the film's villain, Shiwan Khan, 
"the Master of Oriental Nemesis," several of its key characters, as well as the 
broad outlines of a plot about a madman using a stolen scientific device to 
threaten world domination. 
</P>
<P>
 What the movie does come up with on its own is a back story detailing how 
Lamont Cranston became the Shadow. Baldwin's character is introduced as Ying 
Ko, the Butcher of Lhasa, a ruthless drug lord with long fingernails and a yen 
to control the entire opium output of Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Ying Ko is abducted by a powerful and altruistic holy man known as the 
Tulku, who teaches the secret of clouding men's minds and helps him to struggle 
against the darkness in his own spirit. Thus equipped, Ying Ko heads back home 
to New York and a double life as the wealthy socialite Cranston and the 
relentless Shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 It is in New York that the film's ravishing look really kicks in. Working with 
cinematographer Stephen H. Burum, costume designer Bob Ringwood and three art 
directors, production designer Nemec dazzles in every single scene, creating 
atmospheric city streets, elegant nightclubs and knockout interiors that are 
characterized by a carefully thought-out use of detail. Not even the original 
"Batman" or the gaudy "Dick Tracy" managed to look this breathtaking this 
consistently. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Shiwan Khan (John Lone), a rogue pupil of the Tulku's and the last living 
descendant of the great Genghis, shows up in Manhattan, "The Shadow's" 
extensive use of special effects comes into greater play. Ten separate 
companies contributed their skills, coming up with such nifty tricks as forms 
materializing out of fire, a wonderfully elaborate Shadow message service and a 
knife with an evil mind of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping all of this moving is director Russell Mulcahy, himself a visual 
technician known for his music videos and the loud and tedious "Highlander." 
Although he is still uncertain in handling actors, Mulcahy, a lifetime Shadow 
fan, overall does the best job of his career, orchestrating explosions and 
broken glass so that they meld with the rest of the picture instead of 
overwhelming it. 
</P>
<P>
 But just as Cranston has to fight against the crasser side of his nature, so 
"The Shadow" must contend with the unfortunate way the film has been 
dramatically imagined. Not surprisingly, it is a losing battle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From "Star Wars" through "Batman," the camping up of pulp material has become 
a genre in itself, and giving the script assignment to the derivative Koepp, 
who has made a nice career ("Jurassic Park," "Carlito's Way," "The Paper") out 
of crafting reasonable facsimiles of previously successful material, probably 
seemed like the smart money decision. 
</P>
<P>
 But writing truly wised-up repartee is harder than it looks, and, like a small 
boy scrawling graffiti on a monument, the dialogue in "The Shadow" consistently 
undercuts the wonderful mood the visuals have worked so hard to create. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Jonathan Winters as police commissioner Wainwright Barth, the 
actors are understandably flummoxed by the script's self-conscious cutesiness. 
Baldwin, Lone and Penelope Ann Miller as the glamorous Margo Lane continually 
struggle for the right tone, while Tim Curry as a mad scientist gives up the 
fight and goes totally over the top. And what could have been a classic ends up 
yet another story of what might have been. 
</P>

bloodless shootings, a near-drowning and a vicious computer-generated knife.

MOVIE REVIEWS; 'BLOWN AWAY': HERE A BOOM, THERE A BOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Babies are often content to be entertained by things that go boom. Adults may 
require a bit more with their boom -- like a story that makes a smidgen of 
sense, characters that we can connect with, a few good jokes maybe, a few 
thrills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blown Away" is graced with none of these attributes. It's a baby-go-boom 
movie with an attitude. Jeff Bridges plays Jimmy Dove, the star of Boston's 
Bomb Squad, who, 20 years before when his name was Liam, fled the Irish 
Republican Army after sabotaging an explosion that would have killed innocent 
bystanders. Now the mastermind of that thwarted attack, Tommy Lee Jones' Ryan 
Gaerity, has broken out of a Northern Ireland prison and set his sights on 
dismembering Liam/Jimmy -- but not before systematically exploding his Bomb 
Squad buddies, his violinist wife (Suzy Amis) and her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes sense that a movie with this many explosions would be stylistically 
over the top. Everyone in it seems pitched for destruction; even a child's 
back-yard birthday party is turned into a hyperkinetic frenzy, just to get our 
juices flowing. The action, and the acting, are so hyperbolic and over-scaled 
that at times "Blown Away" seems on the verge of becoming an opera -- not an 
opera anybody would want to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 There's so much talent connected with this film -- from the cast, which also 
includes Forest Whitaker and Lloyd Bridges, to director Stephen Hopkins -- that 
its bludgeoning badness is like a sick joke. "Blown Away" is a lesson in how a 
movie cooked up with sure-fire commercial elements can self-destruct as messily 
as one of Gaerity's bombs. The reason it's so rank is because it exists only to 
make lucre and kaboom. And although movie audiences seem more than willing to 
turn terrible movies into hits, the arrant cynicism of "Blown Away" will 
probably turn off far more people than it turns on. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, there's a much better film out there right now that manages to do 
most of what "Blown Away" attempts -- "Speed." That movie isn't much more than 
a whiz-bang mechanical job laced with outlandish heroics, but it has an 
awareness of its own preposterousness that makes it fun to watch, and its 
heroes are winning -- superhuman ordinary people. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But in "Blown Away," Jimmy Dove is such a high-tension-wire jitterbug and 
Gaerity such a Gaelic meanie that they seem to be competing for this year's 
Most Implausible Character award. (When he isn't singing "Pop Goes the Weasel," 
Gaerity is grooving to tapes of the Irish rock group U2.) 
</P>
<P>
 Bridges and Jones flail about in a purgatory of bad acting, which is 
particularly upsetting since they're two of the best actors in the business. 
They're probably much worse in these roles than routine actors would be because 
they're reaching for something raw. Couldn't they see how overcooked their 
roles already were? On the undercooked side, you've got one of the screen's 
finest actresses, Suzy Amis, loitering in one of those Jimmy-I-Don't-Even-Know- 
Who-You-Are-Anymore roles. And then there's Lloyd Bridges brogueing about like 
a superannuated leprechaun. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Jimmy learned his bomb expertise from Gaerity, we look forward to a game 
of wits between these two. But the screenwriters, Joe Batteer and John Rice, 
must think we'll be bored with all that cat-and-mouse business. As the film 
lurches along from explosion to explosion, there's less of the entertaining 
Should-I-Cut-the- Red-Wire-or-the-White-Wire stuff and more yelling and 
throttling. The work of a modern-day bomb squad in the era of micro-technology 
is a terrific movie subject. It deserves more than the firestorms of "Blown 
Away."  
</P>
<P>
 Here's something more punishing to contemplate than anything in the movie. 
What if some malevolent theater owner decides to double-bill "Blown Away" with 
"Backdraft"? 
</P>
<P>

 Murphy's Management Switch: Actor Eddie Murphy plans to sign with Hollywood's 
Creative Artists Agency, following a long association with International 
Creative Management. Sources say the deal will be announced early next week. 
Murphy, who became a superstar in the 1980s with hits such as "48 HRS." and 
"Beverly Hills Cop," is said to be unhappy with the recent course of his 
career. His latest movie, "Beverly Hills Cop 3," has taken in a disappointing 
$39.4 million to date. The actor is said to be getting $12 million for a remake 
of "The Nutty Professor" for Imagine Films/Universal Pictures, and otherwise 
receives $15 million for sequels. In January he plans to shoot "Vampire in 
Brooklyn" for Paramount and director Wes Craven. CAA and Murphy's 
representatives declined comment on the move. At CAA, Murphy would be 
represented by a team consisting of Chairman Michael S. Ovitz, President Ron 
Meyer, Richard Lovett and David O'Connor. TELEVISION

 Staying at CNN: Despite offers of high-profile foreign correspondent jobs from 
ABC, CBS and NBC, award-winning CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour has 
signed a new multi-year contract to stay with the all-news cable network as 
senior international correspondent. Amanpour -- who this year became the first 
TV journalist to win the Peabody, Polk and DuPont awards in the same year -- is 
believed to have turned down the more lucrative network offers out of loyalty 
to CNN and the stories she's currently covering.

 * First Out of the Gate: The 90-minute premiere of Aaron Spelling's new 
"Melrose Place" spinoff, "Models Inc.," won its time period by a slight margin 
Wednesday night, according to overnight ratings from the nation's top 31 
markets. The Fox show attracted an estimated 18% of the available audience, to 
top ABC's 17%, NBC's 16% and CBS' 12%. The show had a more comfortable margin 
in Los Angeles, where it drew 25% of the audience, an estimated 750,960 homes. 
The closest competitor locally was ABC, with about 18% of viewing homes.

 * Moving to NYC: After eight years in Los Angeles, the MTV Video Music Awards 
will return to its roots at New York's Radio City Music Hall in September. 
Executives at MTV, which is headquartered in New York, have been meeting with 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to discuss ways to give one of the music industry's 
premier award shows a New York flavor by staging events throughout the city and 
covering them with live remotes. RADIO

 Asian-Language Radio: Four Southern California radio stations have joined the 
Asia One Network, the country's first Asian-language network, with three of the 
stations beginning gradual program changes today. KMAX (Pasadena), KBAX (Orange 
County) and KAXX (Ventura County), three stations that trimulcast on the 107.1 
FM frequency, will join the network along with KWIZ-FM (96.7), the first 
Asian-formatted FM station in Orange County, which will continue its Vietnamese 
and Tagalog programming. The trimulcast stations previously featured gospel 
music along with some Asian programming. Initial programming changes today 
include a daily 7-9 a.m. Japanese-language drive-time show featuring news and 
weather. Mandarin- and Korean-language programming will be added later this 
summer. LEGAL FILE

 Sly's Suit: Sylvester Stallone has sued a New York attorney for libel, 
accusing lawyer Edward D. Fagan of making false allegations that the actor and 
part-time painter had engaged in a fraudulent art transaction. The suit, filed 
in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia, alleges that Fagan defamed Stallone by 
proposing an article to the Star tabloid about Stallone cheating a woman out of 
three paintings she had owned and which were painted by Stallone before he 
became a famous actor. The story was never published. Stallone, denies such an 
incident occurred. He seeks $50 million in damages.

 * Hammer Update: A Los Angeles judge has temporarily allayed fears that the 
UCLA/Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center might lose half of its art 
collection in a $400-million lawsuit. But the museum plans to proceed with a 
Nov. 11 auction of one of its most valuable assets -- an illustrated manuscript 
by Leonardo da Vinci, valued at $10 million -- because many aspects of the 
complicated case are still unresolved and a reserve fund may be needed to pay 
any legal judgments. In a summary judgment issued Tuesday, Superior Court Judge 
Ronald E. Cappai dismissed claims against the museum and Occidental Petroleum 
Corp. made by Joan Weiss, the niece and sole heir of the late oil man's wife, 
Frances Hammer. Weiss, whose suit contends that Frances Hammer was cheated of 
her fair share of community property, including half of the art collection, 
plans to appeal the judge's decision, her attorney said. Weiss' additional 
claims -- against Armand Hammer's grandson, Michael Hammer, the Armand Hammer 
Foundation and a group of attorneys who advised Frances Hammer -- are scheduled 
to go to trial on July 11. CLASSICAL MUSIC

 Not Up to No. 1: For only the second time in the competition's 36-year 
history, a tough jury of former winners declined to award first prizes in 
either piano or violin in the prestigious Tchaikovsky international 
competition, which concluded in Moscow on Wednesday. The $4,000 second prize 
for piano went to Nikolai Luganski, 22, of Russia; in violin, 17-year-old 
Jennifer Koh of Chicago shared second place with Anastasia Chebotareva, 21, of 
Russia. Koh also received an award for best Tchaikovsky performance by a 
violinist, a special artistry award and an award for being the youngest 
performer in the finals. The Tchaikovsky competition, which helped launch the 
careers of Van Cliburn and Vladimir Ashkenazy, is held in Moscow every four 
years. SHAUNA SNOW

 "Baby's Day Out" is one of those frenetic John Hughes ideas that manages to 
seem uproarious and cruel at the same time. It's another entry in his kiddie 
specialty -- clobber comedies featuring people without nervous systems. He's 
making animated features without the animation. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine-month-old Baby Bink (played alternately by identical twins Adam Robert 
and Jacob Joseph Worton) has been whisked from his well-to-do parents (Lara 
Flynn Boyle and Matthew Glave) by a trio of bumbling kidnapers (Joe Mantegna, 
Joe Pantoliano, Brian Haley) who proceed to lose the baby in the middle of 
Chicago's hubbub. 
</P>
<P>
 If you were upset by the scene in the Coen brothers' "Raising Arizona" where 
the kidnaped baby is left unattended in the middle of a highway, you'll 
positively blanch at "Baby's Day Out," where Baby Bink is allowed to crawl 
through and under traffic, get whisked through revolving doors, waddle across a 
thin plank hundreds of feet in the air, swing out on a steel girder, nestle 
with a caged gorilla -- for starters. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes, whose script was directed by Patrick Read Johnson, buys off the 
queasiness one may feel at all this unsupervised mayhem by making Baby Bink 
obliviously happy. Bink is delighted to be on this daylong outing -- it's like 
a full-scale re-enactment of one of his nursery book jaunts. 
</P>
<P>
 Either you buy into this slapstick bliss or you reject the movie altogether. 
It's the same choice we were offered by "Home Alone," where an accidentally 
abandoned child is terrorized by a pair of scurvy housebreakers. Hughes and 
Johnson are so adept at turning this peewee and his tormentors into comic 
cut-ups that the maliciousness at the movie's center never really takes hold. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What registers instead are the occasional heart tugs. Hughes' movies would be 
better if they were even nastier: They lack the courage of their own 
heartlessness. As Bink's mother, Lara Flynn Boyle plays a high-society matron 
who initially regards her baby as a kind of cuddly ornament; she wants his 
picture taken for the newspaper society pages. It's the baby's nanny (Cynthia 
Nixon) who instinctively knows where the lost baby is heading. That's because 
she's untainted by riches. (The movie plays up her maternal gifts only to give 
her short shrift at the end.) Baby Bink himself is a snuggly-wuggly cherub 
without a yowling moment. He's much too good for his parents. (His experience, 
of course, teaches them to be better parents.) 
</P>
<P>
 The filmmakers are clever at concocting ways for Baby Bink to get fed and 
diaper-changed while paddling about the city on all fours. They manage to 
anticipate most of our literal-minded objections -- which helps to ground the 
plot's outlandishness. As the kidnapers, Mantegna, Pantoliano and Haley are 
adept clobber comics, and they fit right into the cartoonish landscapes. 
Chicago -- courtesy of visual effects supervisor Mike Fink -- is transformed 
into an anything-goes wonder world where giggly babies atop skyscrapers can 
swing out over the city with aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
 When this sort of stuff works, as it does a fair amount of the time in "Baby's 
Day Out," it points up how much can be done with state-of-the-art special 
effects. "Baby's Day Out" could not have been made nearly as well even five 
years ago. (Whether it should be made is another story.) Nowadays just about 
anything that once was visualized as animation can be duplicated as 
live-action. And for an in-your-face comedy master blaster like Hughes, the 
live-action mode is the best way to pin us to the wall. If the Three Stooges 
were alive today, not to mention Baby Leroy, he'd have them waddling and 
bludgeoning in eye-popping hyperspace. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG, for mild language and comic action. Times guidelines: It 
includes a kidnaping and many scenes of a baby endangered by a gorilla, flying 
objects and hurtling cars that may terrify the very young..

MOVIE REVIEW ; 'FISH' SENSITIVELY CATCHES HUMAN NATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most important remark in Rose Troche's quirky lesbian romantic comedy "Go 
Fish" occurs when, leaving a theater, a woman says she didn't think the 
filmmaker was trying to "represent the entire gay community . . . that's a lot 
to ask." 
</P>
<P>
 This observation applies directly to Troche, who's introducing us to a 
close-knit group of young women living in Chicago, many of whom like to dress 
like boys, a grungy look that isn't going to appeal to all lesbians, nor should 
it have to. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that the low-budget "Go Fish," which exhilaratingly proclaims 
Troche and her co-writer and star Guinevere Turner as fresh and lively talents, 
could just turn out to be a crossover success. Troche and company have an 
amusing but sensitive take on human nature that transcends sexual orientation 
and a consistently original and witty way of expressing it. Surely, straights 
as well as gays can identify with the vicissitudes of dating that plague the 
film's pretty but tart heroine, Max (Turner), who's as pert as a young Debbie 
Reynolds. Max is the woman who doesn't like the unidentified movie, and 
defending it is her new acquaintance Ely (V. S. Brodie). 
</P>
<P>
 It has taken a certain amount of good-natured maneuvering and pressuring on 
the part of mutual friends to get the two women to go out together. First of 
all, Max, who's aptly described by a pal as a "total babe," spells out her 
initial response to Ely: U-G-L-Y. Beanpole thin and long nosed, Ely is 
decidedly plain and shy to boot. Besides, she considers herself attached; never 
mind that her lover has been living in Seattle for two years and that Ely has 
seen her only three times in that time. But Ely has a radiant smile and a 
sweet, gentle nature. Besides, Max finds it so unexpectedly easy to talk to 
Ely. 
</P>
<P>
 Their friends couldn't be more caught up in matchmaking than the women in Jane 
Austen's "Pride and Prejudice," and their bemused but loving concern allows us 
to get to know them as well. Principal are Max's roommate, her onetime 
professor Kia (T. Wendy McMillan), who specializes in women's studies and is an 
ample, formidably but humorously intellectual black woman who has just 
commenced a romance with an attractive Latina, Evy (Migdalia Melendez). Then 
there's Daria (Anastasia Sharp), the playgirl of the group, a bartender who 
unapologetically constantly moves from one woman to the next but is as 
convinced as Kia that Max and Ely are made for each other. 
</P>
<P>
 A delightful storyteller, Troche comes up with wholly unexpected and 
consistently effective bits of visual punctuation -- there's much cutting to 
expressive shots of hands -- and she has a subtle way with sensuality and a 
secure touch with non-professional actors. Admittedly, Max's growing sexual 
attraction to Ely is a stretch, which could have been slackened helpfully by 
Ely merely ditching the world's clunkiest eyeglasses at the same time she goes 
in for a radical new hairstyle. But then "Go Fish's" parting shot is, that "the 
girl you're going to meet doesn't look like any girl you know."

lesbian sexuality, discreet nudity and sensuality, adult themes .

RESTAURANT REVIEW; THE TASTE OF CHANGES IN THE KITCHEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have been eating out in this town long enough now to see restaurants change 
hands multiple times. El Mocambo became the Sky Grill, which, in turn, became 
Zucchero. Flags became the Chaya Diner, which became El Chaya and is now Book 
Soup Bistro. Opera became La Regatta, then something else, then Kenny's Steak 
House -- I can't keep all the genealogies straight. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience of visiting a new restaurant at an old familiar address always 
has an odd, dream-like disjunctive quality, full of deja vu and strangeness. 
Sometimes I've been filled with nostalgia, sometimes gladdened by innovative 
change. But never have I felt weirder or sadder or more like I'd wandered into 
a troubled dream than when I walked into Italy's Little Kitchen at what was the 
former site of Trattoria Angeli. 
</P>
<P>
 The space, as originally designed by architect Michele Saee, was airy, 
beckoning, visually sophisticated and amusing. Industrially flavored steel 
flourishes (a catwalk, light fixtures that looked like graceful robotic arms) 
were balanced by warm gold-wood walls, red tablecloths and chef-owner Evan 
Kleiman's gratifying big-souled cucina rustica. 
</P>
<P>
 The recession, a shift in dining patterns and consistently high overhead were 
probably all factors in closing the remarkable steel and glass door to 
Trattoria Angeli. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, shortly the door opened again, to another Italian restaurant. This 
time, rusty steel letters on the front of the building spell out Italy's Little 
Kitchen. And on the inside . . .  
</P>
<P>
 As if sternly correcting a fanciful and good-hearted impulse, the new 
inhabitants have sloppily sloshed dark brown stain all over the interior's 
formerly pale wood. Beams, walls, balcony are now dark as the aged veneer of an 
old pizza joint. The architectonics remain, chastened, vestigial. Tablecloths 
and walls are bright white; the starkness is resounding. 
</P>
<P>
 If the first shock comes from the look of the place, the next comes when we 
receive a small round pillow of warm bread. At first glance, it's not unlike 
Angeli's dreamy rounds, and we tear into it. But these are doughy, heavy, 
yeasty discs soaked with oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparison between the two establishments is invited: They're both Italian, 
and the prices are pretty close. The truth is, there's no contest when it comes 
to the food. Evan Kleiman's straightforward, deceptively simple Italian food 
was intelligent, deeply satisfying, nervy and memorable. Her ingredients were 
impeccable. Who can forget her strawberry risotto? Or the perfection of 
spaghetti with sweet butter and parmigiano ? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's Little Kitchen has a different approach to food. "I used to eat at 
this little pizza joint with the same name on Manchester," recalls a friend as 
we walk in the door. "Back in the days when I was a starving college student." 
She is, of course, referring to the original, still-extant Italy's Little 
Kitchen in Westchester. The two establishments share about the same menu, 
although at the new West Los Angeles locale, the wine list is more extensive, 
the food more expensive. The pricier Little Kitchen also offers nightly seafood 
specials. 
</P>
<P>
 The food at the new Little Kitchen ranges from acceptable to execrable. The 
grilled vegetables, well-charred and ample in portion, are just fine. Arugula 
salad with radicchio, tomatoes, goat cheese, raisins and walnuts is a little 
busy but definitely edible. A salad with white canned tuna, white beans, 
romaine lettuce is inoffensive. But one can only speculate what the kitchen did 
to the thinly battered fried calamari to give it that tough translucence and 
fishy taste. 
</P>
<P>
 The best thing we eat is the sauteed rapini (Italian broccoli) with sun-dried 
tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Pizza "Bianca" is a sea of grease on a heavy, doughy crust. Pastas again can 
be perfectly fine (scampi and linguine), muddled (penne in a spicy red sauce 
with radicchio, pancetta, onions, goat cheese) or sub-average (bland, gummy 
spinach ravioli). Dinners do come with soup and salad, although both the watery 
minestrone and ordinary Caesar are utterly unmemorable. A salmon filet actually 
looks quite appealing -- too bad our waiter never told us the night's specials 
or we might have sampled it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Italy's Little Kitchen, 11651 Santa Monica Blvd., West Los Angeles, (310) 
996-1172. Open seven days for lunch and dinner. Beer and wine only. Valet 
parking. Major credit cards accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $28-$52.

MOVIE REVIEW; KATE BUSH TOES 'THE LINE' WITH APLOMB; THE 50-MINUTE MUSICAL 
FANTASY FEATURES THE ART-ROCK SINGER IN A LOOSE REMAKE OF 'THE RED SHOES.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kate Bush has always seemed like a true sensualist trapped in an English 
art-rock singer's overcerebral body. She makes hay of that tension by casting 
herself in a very loose remake of "The Red Shoes," adapted into her 
self-directed 50-minute musical fantasy "The Line, the Cross, the Curve" 
(opening today for two days at the Nuart, 11272 Santa Monica Blvd., West Los 
Angeles, with a Laurie Anderson film). 
</P>
<P>
 The singer plays herself as a pop star whose yearning to be a great dancer, 
too, tempts her to take on the demonized shoes that'll turn her into a 
terminally twinkle-toed Moira Shearer sort, dancing unto death. Miranda 
Richardson is the bewitched ballerina who steps out of a rehearsal-hall mirror 
to foist off the snazzy footwear. Soon Bush is laced up and pirouetting 
uncontrollably back through that mirror -- Moira in Wonderland? -- into a 
fantasy world full of symbolic obstacles and quickie quests, hoofing a path 
through six songs from last year's "Red Shoes" album. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously Bush isn't about to improve upon the classic 1948 Michael Powell 
film that was her inspiration, or for that matter on the Hans Christian 
Andersen fairy tale that was Powell's. But Powell might approve of her 
filmmaking's richly lit, darkly colorful leitmotifs. And Bush is less 
interested in homage than using the shoe shtick as launch pad for a series of 
independent, increasingly surreal music-vid vignettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Even for those of us outside the cult of Kate, a good deal of the indulgence 
pays off. There's a surprisingly haunted resonance in the combination of 
romanticism and mortality in some numbers, especially "Moments of Pleasure," 
which has Bush swirling past a gauntlet of the dearly departed in a snowstorm 
somewhere high above Manhattan (!). Elsewhere she gets to shimmy with aplomb, 
of course -- not Shearer, but not bad. Entranced and trouncing through mounds 
of fresh fruit in her red shoes near the climax, she's an agreeably earthy 
etherealist. CHRIS WILLMAN

JAZZ NOTES: SCHUUR, KING: A BLENDING OF DISPARATE STYLES PAYS OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The seamless sweep of Diane Schuur's alto voice and B. B. King's 
rough-and-tumble baritone may seem an improbable combination, but album buyers 
disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heart to Heart," the pair's new recording on GRP Records, jumped to No. 1 on 
the Billboard magazine jazz charts in its initial week of release, bumping Tony 
Bennett's "Stepping Out," which was at the top of the chart for close to 30 
weeks. "Heart to Heart" has been at No. 1 for six weeks, and Mark Wexler, a 
senior vice president at GRP, says that sales are still "very strong." 
</P>
<P>
 The album, which was recorded at Capitol Studios in Hollywood late last year, 
contains a variety of songs, but not one single blues -- King's raison d'etre. 
There's Don Gibson's "You Don't Know Me," Aretha Franklin's "Spirit in the 
Dark," even an old chestnut like Irving Berlin's "I'm Putting All My Eggs in 
One Basket." Many of these were a stretch for King, who is not known as a 
ballad singer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always liked jazz and standard songs, but for me to try and sing 'em -- 
no way!" King says with a laugh in a telephone interview from Oklahoma City. 
"It was a real challenge and real work. It made me feel good about myself that 
I tried to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 On most of the selections, the pair did not sing as a duet. Schuur recorded 
her track, and then King added his. On two or three tunes, among them "I Can't 
Stop Loving You," they sang together. 
</P>
<P>
 "He delivered," says Schuur, from her home in Seattle. "He sings with so much 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 It was easier, King says, to record separately. "Otherwise, I'd just be 
listening to her, she sounds so good," says King, who drops in typically 
ringing-note guitar solos on most tunes. "Compared to hers, my voice sounds 
like wheels on a gravel road." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to describe the toughest part in the recording, Schuur said it was the 
blending of her's and King's disparate styles. "He's more laid back, I'm more 
intense, and we tried to meet somewhere in the middle," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair have appeared together twice since the recording, once in Memphis and 
again earlier this month at a celebration at Universal City that announced the 
fall opening of the B. B. King Blues Club on Universal's CityWalk. No future 
dates have yet been set. 
</P>
<P>
 Adieu to Vine St.: The Vine St. Bar & Grill has closed. The 15-table Hollywood 
room, which opened in 1981 and presented such greats as Dizzy Gillespie and Joe 
Williams, ceased operating recently. "It's finished," said owner Ron 
Berenstein. "It's going to be sold shortly." 
</P>
<P>
 Berenstein cited numerous reasons for the closure. "There was a lack of 
interest on the part of the buying public for a small, independent jazz room," 
he said. "That coupled with (California's) economic circumstances, our 
location, the earthquake and other factors." 
</P>
<P>
 Berenstein said he planned to open another restaurant in the near future, and 
perhaps he'll have a jazz policy. "We'll see what happens," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodby to 'Smooth Jazz': KAJZ-FM, the Santa Monica-based commercial jazz 
station that took up the jazz format in September, 1992, is no more. Two weeks 
ago, the station changed its call letters to KACD-FM, and now calls itself "CD 
103.1," using the slogan "Smooth Sounds for Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 The new format blends instrumental tracks by the likes of Grover Washington 
Jr. and Earl Klugh with more pop-leaning vocals by Anita Baker, Al Jarreau and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took the station from a jazz format and have turned it toward something 
with more mass appeal," says Monica Thomas, KACD-FM's program director, who 
previously worked in the same post at KOAI-FM in Dallas. "Now there will be 
strong adult vocals blended with melodic instrumentals, making the presentation 
more embraceable for people." 
</P>
<P>
 KAJZ-FM offered listeners a blend of contemporary artists such as Klugh and 
Jarreau with mainstream jazz artists such as Oscar Peterson and Stan Getz. But, 
according to Thomas, the station never scored well in Arbitron ratings, its 
highest share being slightly over 1 point, its lowest, in a survey released 
earlier this year, a 0.4.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; SOUTHERN CULTURE A MIX OF COUNTRY, SURF, ROCK KITSCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern Culture on the Skids is a trio from North Carolina that's been 
basking proudly in its white-trash roots for 10 years, banging out countrified 
surf music with a kitschy rock edge. The group's approach was a perfect fit 
Wednesday with the cheesy tiki decor of Jacks Sugar Shack, where its 
tongue-in-cheek blend of backwoods flavor, ironic stance and driving, tight 
delivery won over the small audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer-guitarist Rick Miller, in overalls, straw hat and no shirt, craned his 
neck and flapped his arms to the song "Ain't Nobody Here but Us Chickens," and 
yee-hawed sporadically throughout the set. Singer-bassist Mary Huff, in a 
polka-dot dress and bouffant hairdo, sang such songs as "Daddy Was a Preacher 
and Mama Was a Go-Go Dancer" in nasal, Appalachian tones. 
</P>
<P>
 A version of the Louvin Brothers' "Great Atomic Power," a '50s tune that casts 
a warily religious eye at the new energy source, highlighted the set, which 
shimmied with surf guitar and pounded with the energy of charged rockabilly. 
Southern Culture is strictly for kicks -- a musical equivalent of Saturday 
night mailbox bashing. 
</P>

 * Southern Culture on the Skids plays tonight at Fuzzyland, Mr. T's Bowl, 5621

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; COSTNER'S 'EARP' GIVES LIFE TO OLD EARP VIDEOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With last week's theatrical release of "Wyatt Earp," starring Kevin Costner, 
preceded by the video debut of another Earp movie, "Tombstone," with Kurt 
Russell, there's renewed interest in the frontier marshal. 
</P>
<P>
 Now video retailers are prominently displaying old movies about Earp that had 
been buried in the Western bins. 
</P>
<P>
 The best of the lot are "My Darling Clementine" (1946) and "Gunfight at the 
O.K. Corral" (1957). Directed by John Ford, "Clementine" features Henry Fonda 
as Earp and Victor Mature as Doc Holliday. This is one of the great Westerns of 
that era, with Mature, playing Holliday as a dashing scholar, giving one of the 
two best performances of his career ("Kiss of Death" was the other). The 
chemistry between Fonda and Mature is terrific. 
</P>
<P>
 Until "Tombstone," the Earp movie with the best action sequences was "Gunfight 
at the O.K. Corral," with Burt Lancaster as Earp and Kirk Douglas as Holliday. 
Directed by John Sturges, it features some taut, marvelously edited action 
sequences. Some Western-film fans list this as one of the top five Westerns of 
the '50s, just after "High Noon" and "Shane." 
</P>
<P>
 "Frontier Marshal," from 1939, is little more than a B Western, with Cesar 
Romero hamming it up as Holliday and Randolph Scott making Earp as interesting 
as a tumbleweed. "Wichita" (1955), which focuses on Earp, isn't much better, 
with Joel McCrea playing the hero with zero flair. What's worse, the action 
scenes aren't even well staged. 
</P>
<P>
 Another one to skip is "Hour of the Gun," a 1967 movie that follows Earp 
(James Garner) and Holliday (Jason Robards) in the post-O.K. Corral period. A 
fairly dull Western, with Robards' Holliday the least interesting of all the 
screen characterizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doc" (1971), with Stacy Keach as Holliday and Harris Yullin as Earp, isn't 
out on video yet but it's probably for the best. This colorless Western is the 
worst of all the Earp movies.

 The pilot for the "I Love Lucy" series, shown on TV for the first time a few 
years ago, is just out on video, on CBS at $13. What makes "I Love Lucy: The 
Very First Show" really a must for hard-core fans is the commentary by Lucie 
Arnaz -- daughter of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz -- and the scriptwriters. 
</P>

 There have long been complaints that major video companies neglect the 
Spanish-language market -- particularly the kidvid segment. Buena Vista helped 
fill that void this week, releasing 10 Spanish-language tapes, including the 
animated "Beauty and the Beast," "The Sword and the Stone," "Pinocchio" and 
"Alice in Wonderland" at $25 each, and four "Sing-Along" tapes at $13 each. 
Southern California retailers with large Latino clienteles are expected to do 
good business with these videos.

 Foreign Films 
</P>
<P>
 "Mon Oncle," starring Jacques Tati, is one of the best French comedies ever. 
The 1958 film is available, digitally remastered, on Home Vision Cinema. For 
$30, with English subtitles, (800) 323-4222. . . . For those who have never 
seen famed Japanese actor Kazuo Hasegawa, he's excellent in the 1979 movie "An 
Actor's Revenge," director Kon Ichikawa's film about the revenge mission of an 
actor from a Kabuki troupe. A subtitled rental from New Yorker Video, (800) 
447-0196. . . . Coming from New Yorker on July 13, "The Sun's Burial," a grim, 
fascinating drama set in an Osaka slum, about illegal blood-selling. It's 
directed by Nagisa Oshima, best known for the steamy "In the Realm of the 
Senses." 
</P>
<P>
 Special Interest Videos 
</P>
<P>
 An outstanding documentary, "Schindler," came out Wednesday as a rental on 
HBO. It's about the hero of Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's List," featuring 
interviews with some of the Jews he helped survive the Holocaust. . . . With 
"The Lion King" dominating the box office, kiddies will want related videos. 
One possibility is "The Jungle King," the animated feature about a lion 
maturing into king-of-the-jungle status. Youngsters should find this one 
entertaining. On Sony Wonder at $25. . . . For UFO fanatics, the hourlong 
"Visitors From Space" makes a fairly convincing case -- with interviews and 
photos -- that aliens have come to Earth. Too talky at times but often 
absorbing. For $40 from Films of the Nation Video, (908) 462-3522. 
</P>
<P>
 What's New On Video; 
</P>
<P>
 "Philadelphia" (Columbia TriStar); Hollywood's first major-star AIDS movie is 
significant because of its message about tolerance. Tom Hanks won the Oscar for 
his very sympathetic role as a lawyer who's fired when his firm discovers he's 
a homosexual with AIDS. He sues the firm, hiring a lawyer (Denzel Washington) 
who also has to deal with his own homophobia. The courtroom battle is the 
centerpiece of the movie, which is sometimes genuinely moving -- but at times 
it goes Hollywood and turns shameless tear-jerker. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Name of the Father" (MCA/Universal); The true story of a brash young 
Irishman (Daniel Day-Lewis) who's wrongfully jailed, with his father (Pete 
Postlethwaite), in 1974 for a English pub-bombing that killed five people. 
Riveting drama, set largely in prison, focusing on the father-son relationship, 
the ugly Irish-English feud and the efforts of their attorney (Emma Thompson) 
to set them free. Great acting by the entire cast. The three stars were all 
nominated for Oscars, along with the movie and director Jim Sheridan.  
</P>
<P>
 "Naked" (New Line); Writer-director Mike Leigh's movie, set in London, is 
tough going because the lead character is so unsavory. But if you're in the 
mood for a gut-wrenching downer, try to sit through the adventures of this 
bright, rebellious, abusive, reckless loser -- brilliantly played by David 
Thewlis. The irony is that he does such a good job playing a distasteful 
character that the movie itself is distasteful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blindfold: Acts of Obsession" (Libra); Most fans will skip the R edition of 
this movie, which was shown on cable, in favor of the unrated version, which 
features added footage -- nude scenes of star Shannen Doherty. She plays a 
housewife in the throes of an affair with her kinky therapist (Judd Nelson). 
Doherty gives a zesty performance, helping to make this a cut above the usual 
cheesy fare in the soft-core porn genre. FILMS ON VIDEO 
</P>
<P>
 Recent films coming out on video: MCA/Universal's "Greedy," with Michael J. 
Fox and Kirk Douglas on Aug. 31. Also: "Grumpy Old Men," "Sugar Hill," "House

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; MORE OF KIM BASINGER THAN EVER BEFORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kim Basinger has spelled steam on the big screen for the better part of a 
decade -- some of it just too hot for American movie audiences to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, don't despair. If you have a laser player, she can steam up your living 
room TV screen in unrated releases of two of her sexiest performances: "The 
Getaway" from MCA/Universal Home Video, $35, and "9 1/2 Weeks" from MGM/UA Home 
Video, $40. 
</P>
<P>
 In this year's remake of the classic Sam Peckinpah sex-and-violence race for 
the border, Basinger and real-life hubby Alec Baldwin seduced critics with 
their on-screen sizzle. Almost enough to make folks forget the sexy pairing of 
Ali MacGraw and Steve McQueen, who fell in love during the making of the 
original 1972 film (which, unfortunately, is not yet available on laser). 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal of two beautiful lovers -- married lovers, at that -- baring, and 
seemingly doing, all for their art, is enough to test the voyeur in all but the 
purest of heart. In this nicely letterboxed edition, MCA is thoughtful enough 
to note just where the additional minute of erotic footage has been inserted 
(Chapter 33, Side 2). 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, that's all there is: just one additional minute of "erotic footage never 
before seen in American theaters," if the originally reported running times are 
accurate. But what a minute: Doc McCoy and his tousled, tough wife Carol 
finding 60 seconds of sexual pleasure at the Border Hotel between bloody 
attempts by terrible people (James Woods among them) to put out their fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolby surround sound captures every moan as well as the too-realistic gunfire 
and explosions. 
</P>
<P>
 With "9 1/2 Weeks" you get four fresh minutes of "extra footage considered too 
erotic to release in United States theaters." In this 1986 tale of possessive, 
all-consuming love, Mickey Rourke is the sleazy provocateur . The screenplay -- 
co-written by TV's "The Red Shoe Diaries" Zalman King, Patricia Knop and Sarah 
Kernochan -- almost collapses under the weight of its heavy breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 To some minds, what once seemed unbearably erotic may now seem more like 
weighty ennui. Kim and Mickey don't make quite the same music as Kim and Alec. 
The Baldwins seem to be doing what comes naturally, whereas Basinger seems to 
resent every minute she spends with Rourke on screen. Director Adrian Lyne's 
("Fatal Attraction") stylized sexuality seems oddly dated. 
</P>
<P>
 Basinger also can be seen trying to outwit the law and other nasty criminals 
in "The Real McCoy," paired with Val Kilmer (MCA/Universal, $35). If nothing 
else, she's nice to look at, even without the kinds of love scenes that made "9 
1/2 Weeks" and "The Getaway" such notorious pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
 Laserbits 
</P>
<P>
 New Movies Just Out: "The Pelican Brief" (Warner, letterboxed, $40); "Orlando" 
(Columbia TriStar, letterboxed, $35); "Ghost in the Machine" (FoxVideo, $40). 
</P>
<P>
 Coming Soon: Best picture nominee "In the Name of the Father," featuring best 
actor Oscar nominee Daniel Day-Lewis, is scheduled Wednesday from 
MCA/Universal, at $40; "Body Snatchers," starring Meg Tilly, and "Heaven and 
Earth," starring Tommy Lee Jones, are both due July 13 from Warner at $40. 
MCA/Universal plans two releases of Steven Spielberg's Oscar-sweeping 
"Schindler's List," a letterboxed edition at $45 and a collector's edition with 
supplementary material. Both are due for release on Sept. 21.

ART REVIEWS; AMICO AT ACE: 'C'-ING ISN'T EVERYTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Amico's abstract paintings at Ace Contemporary Exhibitions read like 
snappy, graphic designs. Their crisp, simplified images have the impact of 
smartly laid-out pages in hip magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 Although paintings are usually thought of as being composed, it's more 
accurate to see Amico's 12 large works as having been arranged. Each letter, 
stripe and field seems to have been made elsewhere and then placed on a 
vertical canvas. It's not difficult to imagine the artist in his studio, 
shuffling prototypes until the right look is achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 Amico's use of paint adds to this impression. Palpable sections of bright 
colors appear to have been applied with a trowel and then smoothed into dense 
layers that bury whatever was beneath them. The edges of these elements show 
off the paint's thickness and make each part of the picture look like a 
substantial object that has been cemented to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters "C" and "U" frequently recur. Sometimes tipped on their sides, 
reversed, turned upside-down or cut in half by the paintings' edges, these two 
letters, in various typefaces, are also distended or compressed. They function 
visually and phonetically. 
</P>
<P>
 As emblems, they invite comparison with monograms, logos or the copyright 
symbol. As statements, they demand to be sounded out. With great economy, 
Amico's paintings inquire: "You see?" Or exclaim: "See. You see!" Or bid 
farewell: "See you." 
</P>
<P>
 These clever captions literally describe the conversation-like exchanges that 
take place whenever viewers look at art. Unfortunately, the paintings in which 
they appear don't resonate much longer than it takes to read them. Amico's 
witty ideograms lack the inarticulate power and stubborn mystery of his 
previously speechless works. 
</P>

 Pleasant Glimpse: A modest sampling of collages, drawings and monoprints by 
Claude Bentley (1915-1990) at Boritzer/Gray/Hamano Gallery presents a pleasant 
glimpse of this little-known artist's works on paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Spanning the 1980s, these intimately scaled pieces are playful refinements of 
a formal vocabulary the Chicago-based abstract painter developed in the late 
1940s and early 1950s, alongside the more famous, New York-based Abstract 
Expressionists. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentley's collages consist of carefully torn sheets of brightly colored paper, 
bits of burlap, old envelopes and an occasional wine label. They are 
light-handed and lyrical and sometimes approach a state of weightlessness. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent ones appear to be drifting apart. The solid, architectural 
forms that once stood in the center of Bentley's compositions begin to 
disperse, as if centrifugal force is scattering them outward. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentley's collages are more delicate, tenuous and fragile than those of 
Emerson Woelffer, a slightly more well-known abstract painter who also makes 
collages and was born in Chicago a year before Bentley. In contrast to 
Woelffer's bold, simplified and sometimes disruptive compositions, Bentley's 
collages look almost mannered. 
</P>
<P>
 They willingly accept the conventions of collage and are content to refine its 
limited set of formal issues. Their slight, visual pleasures are wholly 
traditional.

THEATER BEAT: 'LITTLE MURDERS' STILL WIELDS A SHARP RAZOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Time has finally caught up with "Little Murders." 
</P>
<P>
 Jules Feiffer's black comedy outraged audiences in 1967 with its depiction of 
a "normal" American family embracing the disintegration of society with a 
gleeful plunge into armed urban combat. 
</P>
<P>
 A skillful staging by John Pleshette for Actors Conservatory Ensemble at the 
Lex Theatre reminds us just how prophetic Feiffer's razor-edged satire has 
proven. 
</P>
<P>
 During a serendipitous lecture last week at the Santa Barbara Writers 
Conference, Feiffer said that he wrote "Little Murders" because of his growing 
conviction that "something had gone seriously wrong in this country, something 
that no one was willing to look at or talk about. . . . I expected the show to 
close after three weeks, and it did." 
</P>
<P>
 But the tidal onslaught of random violence has so saturated our cultural 
perspective that looking the other way is no longer an option, and yesterday's 
cynicism turns out to be today's realism. Not surprisingly, "Little Murders" 
has gained popularity in subsequent revivals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newquist family at the center of the play is an amalgam of bankrupt 
ideals, rendered with the same terse, penetrating wit of Feiffer's cartoon 
strips -- a father (Dennis Redfield) who struts about with the false bravado of 
Neanderthal masculinity, a deferential mother (Andrea Stein) who clings to 
outdated notions of propriety, an effeminate son (Joe Balogh) who applies his 
graduate school education to classics like "Harlots of Venus." 
</P>
<P>
 When daughter Patsy (Kristin Zaslow) arrives for dinner with fiance Alfred 
(James Hardie) in tow, it's clear her obsession for mixing romance with social 
work is facing "the toughest reclamation job I've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred's self-styled "apathist" stance is a fiercely, self-protective refusal 
to participate in the world, and while Hardie's performance initially mistakes 
this rock-like defiance for soft passivity, he shines in the second half, when 
tragic circumstances ironically trigger Alfred's re-entry into society. 
</P>
<P>
 A savage society to be sure, in which no one escapes caustic scrutiny -- not 
the judge (Stefan Gierasch) who eulogizes his immigrant origins, the hip 
Reverend (Charles Hyman) who performs Alfred's hilariously irreverent marriage 
ceremony or the befuddled police detective (John Freeland Jr.) desperately 
seeking a pattern in the city's outbreak of sniper attacks. In Feiffer's world, 
there are no innocent bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Little Murders," Lex Theatre, 6760 Lexington Ave., Hollywood. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. Runs indefinitely. $10. (213) 
463-6244. Running time: 2 hours.  
</P>
<P>
 A Modern Fable About Power of Love 
</P>
<P>
 "Love Diatribe" is such a sweet, delicate modern fable about neurotic barriers 
and the transformative power of love that the grim reality of author Harry 
Kondoleon's recent death from AIDS would seem to negate his play's fragile 
optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't underestimate Kondoleon's dexterity as a playwright -- he keeps his 
message rather than his personal tragedy in the limelight.  
</P>
<P>
 Tackling the dysfunctional family of the '90s head-on, Kondoleon presents 
about as unsympathetic a brood of self-absorbed whiners as you could find this 
side of a narcissists convention, and miraculously finds a way to make us like 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Not at first, mind you -- the already strained relations in this clan threaten 
to come completely unglued when the two grown children move back in with their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather go back to the old inanities than adjust to new ones," declares 
daughter Sandy (Alice Haberman), admitting her failure as an independent adult. 
Her equally immature brother Orin (Mark Burton) returns after the death of a 
girlfriend we're not even sure he cared about. 
</P>
<P>
 Like son, like father -- dear old dad (Harrison Young) is a graceless buffoon 
who prefers muttering at his children's discarded clothing than face-to-face 
conversation, while Mom (Ann Fairlie), a nurse at the local hospital, brings 
all her frustrations and morbid fixations home with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Toss in a pushy next-door neighbor (Susan Nickells, who perfectly blends 
Florence Henderson perkiness with acid venom), and her oafish son (J. T. 
Nickells), and you've got a seemingly sure-fire recipe for domestic hell. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains for a mysterious pixie-like visitor (Stacey Shaffer) to supply the 
healing influence courtesy of an herbal potion that induces that most effective 
cure for interpersonal strife -- clarity of vision, and the tolerance that goes 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspired goofiness in director Stuart K. Robinson's deliberately 
cartoonish staging at Theatre 1761 amplifies the play's magical elements, 
albeit with some sacrificed naturalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic couldn't keep Kondoleon with us, but he clearly left a little of it 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Love Diatribe," Theatre 1761, 1761 N. Vermont Ave., Los Feliz. Wednesdays, 
8 p.m; Saturday, 10:30 p.m. Runs indefinitely. $5.94. (213) 660-8587. Running 
time: 1 hour, 20 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Solid Performances Help 'Vanities' 
</P>
<P>
 The sight of three high school cheerleaders primping themselves as the 
audience files in for Jack Heifner's "Vanities" sets the tone for the 
hilariously vapid dialogue to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious issues these girls face is coordinating their pom-pom poses 
and planning their attire for the upcoming prom. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a way, they're products of their era -- the unreflected complacency of 
1963 -- and there's an engaging innocence to their inane banter, even as we're 
appalled at their selfishness.  
</P>
<P>
 No Divaz Allow'd Productions' staging at the Complex features an all-black 
cast that neatly emphasizes the play's universal appeal without a whiff of 
altered agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracing the trio's evolving personalities through three stages of life -- high 
school, college and approaching 30 -- the comedy modulates into an increasingly 
serious meditation on the inevitable schisms and uncertainties wrought by the 
passage of time.  
</P>
<P>
 Director Kim Fields' decision to portray the girlfriends with different 
actresses in each scene allows us the bargain opportunity to witness nine 
capable performances for the price of three. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the characters' basic parameters are broadly defined -- the energetic 
group leader (Julie Ann Lucas, Beverly Griffith, Gigi Bolden), the prissy 
homemaker (Wendy Raquel Robinson, Devika Parikh, Charmin Lee) and the 
promiscuous rebel (Yolanda Snowball, Jozie Hill, Teresa Truesdale) -- there's 
no trouble telling who's who when a new team takes over. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet with only five-year intervals separating the three scenes, the variance 
introduced by the revolving cast members is so extreme it's ultimately 
distracting (Truesdale's jaded sophistication doesn't follow organically from 
Hill's angry sarcasm, for example, though both are among the show's strongest 
performances.) More consistency of interpretation is warranted than we get from 
this triple casting strategy, which too often plays like an acting class 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Vanities," Complex, 6476 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends July 16. $12. (213) 466-1767. Running time: 1

THEATER BEAT: FLAWED RENDERING OF SHAW'S 'DESTINY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who needs a theater reviewer when George Bernard Shaw comes onstage and 
delivers his own verdict on the proceedings? 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Man of Destiny," an early Shavian comedy at the Knightsbridge Theatre 
in Pasadena, director Priscilla Finch has "allowed" the playwright (Jerry 
Neill) to become a de facto fifth character, reading aloud his ironic notes on 
the play and making the occasional ad-lib. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least they're not doing 'My Fair Lady,' " he winks at the audience in one 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
 This bold conceit is, alas, the Knightsbridge production's sole selling point. 
Clunky staging and bland performances otherwise mar Shaw's imagined encounter 
between a 27-year-old Napoleon Bonaparte (Peter Asle Holden) and a beautiful 
Austrian spy dubbed the Strange Lady (Barbara Naylor). 
</P>
<P>
 In a dress rehearsal for more mature efforts such as "Pygmalion," Shaw here 
uses a quick-witted battle of the sexes to explore issues of love, equality and 
androgyny. Yet the cast members generally spoil the fun by declaiming the lines 
with hideous French and Italian accents. 
</P>
<P>
 They might have been better off with "My Fair Lady." 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Man of Destiny," Knightsbridge Theatre, 35 S. Raymond Ave., Pasadena. 
Fridays at 7 p.m., Sundays at 2 p.m. Ends July 31. $10-$15. (818) 440-0821. 
Running time: 1 hour and 45 minutes.

 Raymond Myers' performance at the Long Beach Museum of Art on Wednesday may be 
a harbinger for Caribbean music. The former lead singer with Nigeria's Soul 
Vibrations reggae group used the Jamaican sound as his musical base but mixed 
in Nicaraguan carnival and soca rhythms, plus an occasional dash of salsa, into 
his pair of hour-plus sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers is staying in Los Angeles while recording, so his capable, 
well-rehearsed septet didn't quite have the spark and cohesion of a full-time 
unit. The band never failed to deliver solid, vibrant rhythms, but the solos 
were lacking at times -- alto saxophonist Vince Suzuki took several 
well-received solos, but his tone fell on the shrill side of Junior Walker, and 
he was too prone to favor high-register squawks over a full-bodied sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasional nature of the band may account for the inclusion of such easy 
reggae crowd-pleasers as Bob Marley's "Get Up, Stand Up," "Stir It Up" and the 
Peter Tosh arrangement of "Johnny B. Goode." 
</P>
<P>
 But Myers paid even more effective homage with fine performances of one of 
Marley's most beautiful love songs ("Waiting in Vain") and all-time dance floor 
rave-ups ("Lively Up Yourself"), although the latter lost focus with a solo by 
Suzuki that had little apparent relation to the song.  
</P>
<P>
 There was a general flagging of momentum near the end of the first set -- 
though the salsa rhythm foundation of "Latino Soy" was solid enough, the solos 
did let things down. Myers recovered strongly with the soca rhythm of "Spirit 
of Carnival" -- Myers' timbales solo both elevated the energy level and gave a 
kinetic dimension to his stage performance that at times was too laid back.  
</P>
<P>
 The soca-style rhythms always did the trick for Myers; the group really hit 
its stride early in the second set with its adaptation of a traditional 
Nicaraguan rhythm in "Mayaya Lasinki." 
</P>
<P>
 With Myers on timbales and percussionist Marcel Adjibi shifting from congas to 
djembe , the song sparked the evening's first display of ICLS -- i.e., Instant 
Conga Line Syndrome, the tendency of an American audience to form a conga line 
at the first hearing of a carnival-esque Caribbean rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Myers cemented the momentum by shifting to a dance-hall-roots reggae 
combination on "Viva Mi Corazon," with Oneida James digging deep into the bass 
line. With the potential pop appeal of its "La La La La/Viva Mi Corazon " 
chorus, it's conceivable that Myers could follow Big Mountain into the ranks of 
bilingual reggae hit-makers. 
</P>
<P>
 More consistent, strong material like the old Soul Vibrations staple "Black 
Culture" would help, but it was hard to argue with the deftly delivered rhythms 
or the enthusiastic audience response on a hot summer night. 
</P>
<P>
 With groups including Ricardo Lemvo and Makina Loca also on the local scene 
bringing the Afro-Cuban tradition to life by blending soukous with salsa, it 
will be interesting to hear what develops from the kind of pan-Caribbean rhythm 
synthesis Myers is now exploring.

COMEDY REVIEW; SPLENDID TALENTS CAN'T QUITE MUSTER TEAM FEELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Let's start with the good aspects of the "Wack-O-Rama" comedy revue at the 
Brea Improv: 
</P>
<P>
 * John Bowman discussing how he paid dearly for getting into a stare-down with 
a llama. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bowman demonstrating the "John Bowman Party Kit," which consists of a jacket 
that he puts on backward. You can try this at home, too. Guaranteed to kill. 
</P>
<P>
 * Todd Glass caught unaware by his camera crew on a typical day in his life, 
in which he does everything except get the Angels some pitching help and 
eradicate human greed. 
</P>
<P>
 * The "Laugh-In" takeoff, a group effort that dusts off the oldest and dumbest 
jokes in the genre yet which could hold the key to hoisting this show into the 
four-star category. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a quick look at the not-so-good. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bowman as Jean Claude the Hypnotist. (Jean Claude is getting stale. Very, 
very stale. Isn't his visa about to expire?) 
</P>
<P>
 * The revue's failure to sustain a good pace and because of that, its 
inability to mold itself into one cohesive piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, this is an enjoyable production. If you don't like one joke, another 
will be along in a second. But the untapped potential is large, and that makes 
for a somewhat frustrating night. 
</P>
<P>
 Individually, the performers (also in the cast are Tommy Koenig and Lynn 
Shore, with Allan Murray and maybe others rotating in during the run) are all 
splendid talents, but as a team, they fail to sustain 90 minutes of stand-up, 
skits and musical parodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, it's a work in progress, but still, there's something wrong when four 
professional performers fail to cull an hour and a half of their best stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea originated when a number of comics were looking for a way to avoid 
the ups and downs that occur in many headliners' routines, said Robert 
Hartmann, regional manager for the local Improvs, in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 One can't quibble with the premise: Take four solid performers, combine their 
acts, throw in some segues . . . and -- poof! -- 90 minutes of quality time is 
born. Unfortunately, some of the spots go poof.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it's the "Laugh-In" segment toward the end of the show that starts 
tying things together. In it, against a background of music, one comedian tells 
a quick-hitter, then freezes while another takes over. The combination of 
energy and familiar material finally starts to lend the show a spark of 
ensemble and give it its first taste of synergy. 
</P>
<P>
 Other parts that move the show along are Koenig's going disco as Chief 
Ironside (the old Raymond Burr role) and a strategically padded Shore doing a 
Tom Jones takeoff, singing "Delilah" as he roams the audience, schmoozing the 
adoring women. Glass also chips in with an excellent Donahue parody. 
</P>
<P>
 A few more morsels such as these and an effort to get all the comics together 
for another bit or two, would go far in moving this toward a full 90 minutes of 
fine entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Wack-O-Rama" -- a comedy revue with Todd Glass, John Bowman, Tommy Koenig, 
Lynn Shore and others -- continues through July 10, except Monday, at the Brea 
Improv, 945 E. Birch St. $7 to $10. (714) 529-7878.

DANCE REVIEW; JOFFREY BRINGS 'BILLBOARDS' BACK TO L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 He may be an unspeakable graphic symbol in the world of rock 'n' roll, but 
Prince is still "Prince Rogers Nelson (stage name Prince)" in the composer 
credits for the Joffrey Ballet's "Billboards" at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 After performances here a year ago, plus home video and PBS editions since, 
"Billboards" returned to the Southland on Wednesday, danced as strongly as ever 
-- and creatively just as much a mess. The problem isn't with the ex-Mr. P's 
music: It's eminently danceable, as he's proven in his far more interesting and 
provocative music videos. 
</P>
<P>
 No, what's wrong is the slate of choreographers chosen by Gerald Arpino for 
the project -- artists, in several cases, ill-prepared to use the technical 
resources of ballet, much less take classicism into Paisley Park. Would 
"Billboards" have been any less popular as choreographed by, say, Donald Byrd, 
Bebe Miller, William Forsythe and Edouard Lock? Hardly. But it might have been 
much more bearable the second time around. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Laura Dean's section ("Sometimes It Snows in April") again 
looked classy, with the corps dancers building up static electricity in the 
formal, large-scale unison choreography and then sending out lightning bolts of 
virtuosity in the culminating technical display. 
</P>
<P>
 With her heart-shaped magic wand, Lissette Salgado expertly led the endless 
crotch-and-derriere probes of Charles Moulton's "Thunder" segment. In Moulton's 
"Purple Rain" solo, Elizabeth Parkinson unleashed so much energy and passion 
that crude gesticulation fleetingly became dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Capitalizing on bold, artful contrasts in dynamics and emotion, Tom 
Mossbrucker made his first local appearance in the Margo Sappington "Slide" 
choreography originally created for him. Definitely the focus this sprawling 
sequence needs. However, Pierre Lockett looked lightweight in the hyper-macho 
"Release It" sideshow and Beatriz Rodriguez is beginning to resemble a computer 
simulation of herself in her pseudo-sensual hair-stroking. 
</P>
<P>
 An injury to Philip Gardner found Mossbrucker also leading the Peter Pucci 
("Willing and Able") finale opposite the sober, pliant Jodie Gates. 
Unfortunately, he hasn't the right legs for Christine Joly's thigh-specific 
shorts and boots and his sense of interpretive restraint seemed misdirected. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, there are indeed ballets in the Joffrey repertory that benefit from 
Mossbrucker's type of understatement and subtlety. But when your partner is 
inserting her scarlet toe shoe in your mouth, good taste is simply beside the 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 * Joffrey Ballet, Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Music Center, 135 N. Grand 
Ave.Tonight at 8 , Saturday, 2 p.m. ("Les Patineurs," "Return to a Strange 
Land," "A Tri-Fling," "Les Presages"); Saturday, 8 p.m., Sunday, 2 p.m. 
("Billboards"). $15-$55. (213) 480-3232.

MUSIC REVIEW; MORAVEC SHOWS VIRTUOSITY AT THE BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though he has performed in Los Angeles on at least three occasions in the past 
16 years, Ivan Moravec only got around to his L.A. Philharmonic and Hollywood 
Bowl debuts this week. Wednesday night, the 63-year-old Czech pianist played 
Beethoven's G-major Concerto with the Philharmonic on a Bowl preseason program 
conducted by Gerard Schwarz and attended by 5,788 concert-goers. Moravec, who 
is not unknown -- he made his U.S. debut 30 years ago in Cleveland and his 
recordings have had wide distribution here -- was worth waiting for. 
</P>
<P>
 His authority and virtuosity, as displayed in a polished and probing reading 
of the Fourth Piano Concerto, place him among other important international 
pianists born before 1940. He has style, technique, refinement and 
individuality; whatever the musical subject of his next local appearance, 
attention should be paid to it. 
</P>
<P>
 The special joy of this performance, on a Beethoven program where the concerto 
was surrounded by the symphonies Nos. 8 and 4, became the single-minded, 
hand-in-glove collaboration of conductor Schwarz and a second contingent -- the 
first one played Mozart on Tuesday -- of another 41 Philharmonic players. 
Schwarz and those colleagues made it all sound and look easy; we know it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Around this elegance, the bumptious Beethoven proved hard to resist. At the 
end of the evening, and under Schwarz's detailed guidance, the often ladylike 
Fourth Symphony showed lively tomboy spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning, the Eighth Symphony revealed its peasant roots with a 
touching lack of pretension; only then, starting with the understatements of 
the second movement, did the work's quiet nobility assert itself. Not 
surprisingly, in these inner movements, woodwind and horn soloists outdid 
themselves. DANIEL CARIAGA

TV REVIEW; EDIFYING, ENTERTAINING DEATH PENALTY DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Firing Line," William F. Buckley's PBS podium for many years, has always 
taken different guises for different issues. When it tackles the knottiest 
issues, it takes on the most alluring guise of all -- the group debate, when 
Buckley must share the podium with others. The latest of these, cheerfully 
titled "Resolved: The Death Penalty Is a Good Thing," shows that on TV there's 
rhetoric, and then there's rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 Most TV-style rhetoric is pontificating. The rhetoric in this debate's two 
hours is -- or attempts to be -- rhetoric's original role as reasoned argument. 
It's the difference on the right, for example, between Buckley and Rush 
Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 But reason alone never persuaded anyone on a TV debate to change his or her 
mind, and that doesn't happen on the Bard College stage, where moderator 
Michael Kinsley guides the clash between teams for and against capital 
punishment. Joining Buckley are Georgia Assistant Atty. Gen. Susan Boleyn, 
constitutional law scholar Walter Berns and former New York Mayor Ed Koch; on 
the other side are ACLU Executive Director Ira Glasser, Bard President Leon 
Botstein and death row prisoner defense attorneys Bryan Stevenson and Stephen 
Bright. 
</P>
<P>
 The arguments come fast and furious, almost enough to hide the fact that both 
sides grant key points early on. While the pro-penalty group virtually concedes 
that capital punishment isn't a proven deterrent to crime, the anti-penalty 
side barely tries to dispute the moral case that society has an interest in 
meting out grave punishment for grave crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson and Bright, having observed some questionable Georgia murder trials, 
both argue that the death penalty disproportionately falls on black murderers 
of white victims more than any other type of case. They argue -- though it 
doesn't really follow -- that until punishment is color-blind, ban the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Berns quietly brushes this aside, saying that if racism is the problem, then 
clean up the procedures, since bad procedures don't negate the underlying 
values on which punishment is based. Unfortunately for non-Georgia viewers, 
Bright, Stevenson and the comically stern-faced Boleyn tussle too long over 
Georgia cases, though Boleyn is overwhelmed by Bright's claims of that state's 
pattern of racism in court. 
</P>
<P>
 More entertaining are Glasser (sharp and suave), Koch (surprisingly effective) 
and Buckley (taking a while to get his juices going), who aim at general ideas 
more than specific cases. Everyone indulges too much in a dizzying flurry of 
statistics, studies and scholarly babble, but they all finally raise the stakes 
of this profound social issue. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Firing Line Debate -- Resolved: The Death Penalty Is a Good Thing" airs at 
9 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28; 8 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24; 1 p.m. Saturday 
on KPBS-TV Channel 15.

D.A.'S CASE APPEARS STRONG BUT DEFENSE WILL TEST IT; STRATEGY: SIMPSON'S 
LAWYERS WILL TRY TO KEEP OUT KEY EVIDENCE, 911 TAPES. IT WON'T BE EASY, EXPERTS 
SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It can appear to be a powerful case: Blood tests link the suspect to the 
scene, a search conducted under a warrant uncovers incriminating items and 
police have evidence showing the suspect had brutalized the victim before. 
</P>
<P>
 But skillful defense work -- and the right set of circumstances -- can unravel 
the most carefully crafted prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
 By filing a variety of motions, lawyers for O.J. Simpson will try to keep out 
evidence that allegedly ties the famed former athlete to the murders of his 
ex-wife and her friend. In addition to suppressing evidence from a search of 
Simpson's home, defense attorneys may also try to exclude Simpson's statements 
to police, old 911 tapes of Nicole Brown Simpson calling for help as a man 
identified as O.J. Simpson raged in the background and the results of tests 
that might indicate blood and hair found at the murder scene matched Simpson's. 
 
</P>
<P>
 None of it will be easy. If Simpson's lawyers successfully show the initial 
search of Simpson's home was illegal at a hearing Tuesday, the prosecution 
could lose key evidence: the bloody glove that matched one found at the murder 
scene and possibly even blood found on Simpson's driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be an amazing event that the most crucial piece of evidence in a 
high-profile murder case was thrown out," said Cristina Arguedas, a Bay Area 
criminal defense attorney. "That would take one gutsy judge." 
</P>
<P>
 But such motions have succeeded before in long-shot cases. In a Bay Area case, 
a man facing 40 years in prison after drugs and a machine gun were found in his 
home was set free because police had made a false implication in applying for 
the search warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Christian Brando murder case in 1991, the same lawyers who are 
defending Simpson successfully kept out Brando's statements to police because 
an officer had omitted a phrase in the reading of the Miranda rights. 
</P>
<P>
 And an appeals court in San Francisco ruled DNA evidence inadmissible two 
years ago because of scientific uncertainty over how to calculate the odds of a 
match.  
</P>
<P>
 In the motion to suppress evidence, Simpson's lawyers argue that the police, 
scaling a five-foot-high fence, illegally entered the grounds of the 
ex-athlete's Brentwood home when they first went there at 4:30 a.m. on June 13 
to notify him of his ex-wife's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Once on the grounds police found the bloodstained glove and noticed blood 
leading from Simpson's white Ford Bronco on the street to his front door, 
according to an affidavit by Los Angeles Police Detective Phil Vanatter. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are required to obtain a warrant to search someone's property except 
under certain conditions, such as an emergency in which they fear imminent 
destruction of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a search done with a warrant can be unlawful if police misrepresented an 
important fact in seeking it. Simpson's lawyers contend that police 
inaccurately characterized Simpson's absence in their warrant application by 
stating that he had left on an "unexpected" flight to Chicago.  
</P>
<P>
 But a warrant can only be thrown out on grounds of deliberate 
misrepresentation if the magistrate would not have issued it without the false 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Some defense attorneys said Thursday they believe the warrant might be upheld 
because police said they saw blood on the driver's door handle of Simpson's 
white Ford Bronco, which was parked on the street. That evidence alone might 
have been enough to obtain the search warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many open questions," said Loyola University law professor 
Laurie Levenson. "The affidavit is really very bare bones. The officers don't 
say they are doing what they are doing. That may be very important." 
</P>
<P>
 As the case proceeds, Simpson's lawyers also may try to prevent the 
prosecution from using his statements to the police before his arrest. Simpson 
talked to police for three hours without an attorney present on the day after 
the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 But trying to keep out his statements is "going to be very hard in this case," 
said Bay Area defense attorney Ted Cassman, because Simpson apparently signed 
waivers, presumably giving up his Miranda rights, and had talked to an attorney 
beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran defense attorneys say it is always unwise for a suspect to talk to 
police, and Howard Weitzman, Simpson's first lawyer, has said he advised 
Simpson against speaking to them. Police can freely lie to the suspect or trick 
him into believing they already have strong evidence against him, Cassman said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not yet known what Simpson told the police, but defense attorneys say 
prosecutors could try to use any inconsistencies in his statements against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ninety percent of statements have been thrown out because someone asked for a 
lawyer and the cops refused to get them one," Cassman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's statements, on the other hand, probably would be admissible if he 
signed Miranda waivers and was rational enough to know what he was doing, 
several defense attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson defense probably would have better luck in excluding the 911 tapes 
from the trial, an issue that would arise in the trial, not the preliminary 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge would first have to decide whether the tapes were relevant to the 
murder charges against Simpson, and secondly, whether their relevance was 
outweighed by the prejudice they would create against the defendant. 
Prosecutors could not use the tapes only to show that Nicole Simpson feared her 
ex-husband, attorneys said, because her state of mind would be considered 
irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the tape had shown that Simpson had threatened to kill her, prosecutors 
could argue that a prior threat is admissible. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the tapes, Simpson's alleged assaults against his former wife 
could be admitted into evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The courts have a great deal of discretion," San Francisco Public Defender 
Jeff Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Court rulings on admitting evidence of prior abuse in such cases have been 
divided. In a 1983 murder case, a state appellate court held that evidence that 
a husband dragged his wife outside their home, sprayed her with a hose and 
yelled obscenities at her was irrelevant and inadmissible. The court said there 
was no close connection between the husband's previous action and the wife's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 But in another case three years later, a different state appellate court held 
that a prior assault could show motive to kill and ill will and therefore was 
admissible. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior violence is generally admissible if it demonstrates the defendant acting 
according to a common scheme or plan. For example, evidence that linked a 
defendant to a signature murder where a playing card was left on the victim 
could be used to buttress evidence against him in a nearly identical murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there is no common scheme or plan between an allegation of hitting during 
an argument in 1989 and breaking down the door," said an experienced San Diego 
criminal defense lawyer, referring to two incidents that sparked Nicole 
Simpson's previous calls to the police. "That is not even close to what we are 
talking about in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown likened the situation to that of a psychotherapist who was accused in a 
lawsuit about five years ago of raping a patient. Fifteen former patients were 
prepared to come forward to say he also had sexual intercourse with them. But 
because their testimony would not have addressed questions of the defendant's 
motive or identity, it was disallowed, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All it showed was the defendant's propensity," Brown said. "Propensity 
evidence doesn't get in under California law." 
</P>
<P>
 DNA evidence could also be problematic. Most courts in the country admit such 
genetic evidence, but California's appellate courts have been divided on the 
question and the California Supreme Court has not yet ruled on it. 
</P>
<P>
 A court of appeal in San Francisco held two years ago that a critical part of 
DNA evidence -- the statistics that show that someone other than the defendant 
would have the same genetic profile -- was inadmissible. The court excluded the 
evidence on the grounds that scientists were in fundamental disagreement about 
the validity of statistical methods used by the FBI and a private testing lab 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, the prosecution had relied on a type of DNA testing that can 
take two to three months and produce powerful results that juries find hard to 
overlook. For instance, the test can determine that the chances of another 
person having that DNA is only one in several million. 
</P>
<P>
 In a pending case, a state appellate court is being asked to rule on the 
validity of a DNA testing method known as polymerase chain reaction, or PCR. It 
can be done more quickly than the older method, but does not purport to show 
such high odds against a similar match. 
</P>
<P>
 No court in California has ruled on this method. Prosecutors say it is sound 
but some defense attorneys are wary.  
</P>
<P>
 Walter Krstulja, a senior trial attorney and forensics expert in the Los 
Angeles public defender's office, warns that PCR evidence can be unreliable 
because samples can easily be contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The test appears very promising," he said, "but issues of quality control and 
contamination still have to be worked out." 
</P>
<P>
 Alameda County prosecutor Rockne Harmon, who has often used DNA results in his 
cases, strongly believes the testing methods and statistical analyses are 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trial judges don't have much difficulty ruling this evidence admissible," 
Harmon said. "It is just the appellate judges who seem to be balking." 
</P>
<P>
 It is believed that prosecutors in the Simpson case are relying on both 
methods as well as on conventional serology, a less rigorous blood testing 
procedure that can measure the odds against two matching samples being from 
different people to about one in 100. Only serology tests will be introduced at 
the preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the admissibility of any DNA test results may boil down to the 
credibility of the laboratory used by the prosecution and the statistical 
methods used to compute the odds of a match. 
</P>
<P>
 Some attorneys predict the prosecution will win any fight over DNA results 
because previous court rulings were based on methods that are no longer used. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go to a DNA seminar after two years of being away from the stuff," public 
defender Brown said, "and it is all a different world." Who's Who

ON THE SCENE / PATT MORRISON; A SEARING FOCUS ON PONDEROUS PROCEEDINGS

<P>
 Hundreds of reporters, scores of hours of video, thousands of words expended 
to convey the tedium and the lunacy of Thursday in Los Angeles -- and the mood 
of the day was best captured by the behavior of a copying machine in the 
fifth-floor county clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning out document replicas to satisfy all the reporters who wanted them, it 
simply overloaded and stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a day so crazy that O.J. Simpson's lawyer-friends Robert Kardashian and 
Leroy Taft, pursued into the street by reporters, took a bus -- a bus! -- to a 
Downtown restaurant for lunch and hitched a ride back to court in a police car 
. . . and a day so routine that in cars mired in dense traffic a mere block 
from the courthouse, radios were blaring everything but O.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The first day of O.J. Simpson's preliminary hearing could fit anyplace in 
L.A.'s kaleidoscope: 
</P>
<P>
 Variety would call it a plodding legal sequel that couldn't hold the audience, 
compared to the original blockbuster, the slow-mo twilight freeway chase of two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech could plot the course of Thursday's newsquake, from the courtroom 
epicenter, across town, across the country; to a gym in Long Beach, where 
people stayed aboard the Stairmasters so they could watch TV; to a Crenshaw 
district store, where a saleswoman's 5-year-old daughter said as the TV came 
on, "Oh no, not O.J. again!"; to a noontime Chicago bar where no one wondered 
who he was when the waitress asked, "Do you think he did it?" . . . to the 
Peachtree Street Macy's in Atlanta where, of the 66 color TVs in the 
electronics department, all but two were turned to CNN and Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 And the radio shrinks could say that we have had it up to here with O.J. . . . 
or that we're so avid for every scrap about the case that the Boston Globe can 
trill on for a dozen rapt paragraphs about the prosecutor's "head of tight 
curls" and the defense attorney's "deep, deep tan." 
</P>
<P>
 The day, frame by frame: 
</P>
<P>
 At 7:30 a.m., an hour when even the homeless have just begun to populate 
Downtown streets, Nicole Brown Simpson's sisters, parents and friends were 
sitting in the back booth of a scruffy Downtown coffee shop, waiting to attend 
the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing that had gotten as much buildup as the opening of a new Steven 
Spielberg movie began with promising drama, when the helicopters hove into 
sound and view at 8:40 a.m., tracking the police van bringing Simpson to court. 
(Unlike what one young man assured another on a Downtown street, there is no 
tunnel from the jail to the courthouse.) 
</P>
<P>
 The courtroom pace moved ponderously, disappointing many who had expected 
incendiary TV-movie lawyering. But not everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 At Jefferson Boulevard and Crenshaw Avenue, where "Pray for O.J." T-shirts 
rippled like flags in the late June wind, Jay Akeem paid $10 for an extra-large 
and said: "We grew up on 'Perry Mason' and 'Matlock'. . . . It's tedious going 
through the proceedings though. I was watching this morning, the forensics, the 
LAPD woman -- (it was) getting real technical, but it's important." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Legends sports bar in Santa Monica, Steve Grospitz was late for lunch 
with his sister because he had been watching the case. "I actually was kind of 
wanting for this to get started; we heard so much hearsay. I was interested in 
what the court was going to do. Michael Jackson, the Menendez thing." But the 
city's energy, he figures, "is kind of exhausted." 
</P>
<P>
 With only 80 seats in the courtroom, news stations and the curious found more 
engrossing events out on the courthouse sidewalks. See-saw debates went on 
between Simpson supporters and people such as Jewish Defense League leader Irv 
Rubin, who demanded via bullhorn that defense attorney Robert L. Shapiro not 
forget his "Jewish brother, Ronald Goldman," one of the victims. Perennial 
candidate Melrose Larry Green told a Simpson supporter, "Stand up and smell the 
bagels!" 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, artist Rodney Vanworth created an instant mural when he spread a 
six-foot canvas on the sidewalk and invited people to write on it with markers. 
He had already drawn the figure of a red-smeared woman with knives sticking out 
of her body, a shoe, a jail cell, a sink and a toilet and a trophy with the 
words "hero" and "pity the victims" written on it. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brentwood, as police searched an empty lot for more evidence, it was like 
old times -- two weeks ago when it was the center of the action. 
</P>
<P>
 A delivery man from A Votre Sante restaurant, who had fed the media mob then, 
lost no time in returning Thursday and passing out menus for fare like whole 
wheat chapatis filled with hummus. "This is Brentwood," Sean McFarland said. 
"Nobody eats anything with fat in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce has been part of big legal cases since fast-buck artists sold toy 
monkeys on the sidewalks outside the Scopes evolution trial in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courthouse, shirt-seller K.T. had virtually cleared out all 20 
dozen shirts -- "Don't Squeeze the Juice" and "Pray for O.J." -- in two days. 
One woman fingered a shirt, sniffed and said to K.T., "Do you have any with the 
opposite point of view, like 'Fry O.J.'?" 
</P>
<P>
 City Hall sidewalks served as little more than a parking lot for TV vans -- 
and they all got parking tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 In one city councilman's office, the receptionist admitted that "there's a TV 
in back that no one's supposed to know about." Mayor Richard Riordan's aides 
held their breath lest their boss be bumped yet again from an oft-delayed 
morning news appearance. And standing with the smokers on the west steps, 
Vivian Sarpong complained that she had gone to a drugstore Thursday morning to 
buy "one of those little TVs, and they were all sold out!" She will buy one 
this weekend. At her desk, she prepared "a little spot for my TV. Got a little 
piece of cardboard in case anybody comes by, I can flop it down, cover it up." 
</P>
<P>
 If people watched or listened at work, most tried to do so unobtrusively. 
</P>
<P>
 On the floor of a huge Downtown bank, a woman at a desk murmured that there 
was a TV around somewhere, but "the bank doesn't pay me for that, 
unfortunately." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Radio Shack in the bowels of the Arco towers, a TV showed the Simpson 
case -- but partly because the reception was too bad to get soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 And at Mezzaluna, the bright, prow-shaped Brentwood restaurant where Nicole 
Simpson last ate and Goldman last worked, waiters sliding the luncheon specials 
into the menus looked up at the television suspended from the cloud-painted 
ceiling, and murmured about with the day's legal doings in overheard snips like 
"special circumstances" and "and then he walks." 
</P>
<P>
 The start of the hearing coincided with lunch hour in much of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In the back room of Mother Hubbard's in Chicago, claims adjuster Alona Sanders 
got to monitor the case at work the first day -- but today is another matter. 
"They came in and told us today that as of tomorrow, they were cutting off the 
radios during work hours," Sanders said. "They think it's interfering with our 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it's soccer, not Simpson, that's disrupting the Russian parliament by 
keeping people up until 2 a.m., in Boston bookish circles, the mention of the 
case is enough to divert conversation from more arcane topics. A Boston woman's 
regular two-hour Saturday phone conversation with her mother in Ohio has been 
devoted exclusively to Simpson, and now runs three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Los Angeles, only one moment seemed to vary from the script.  
</P>
<P>
 A tall man in a suit walked into the heavily secured court wearing one of the 
rare, coveted white badges identifying him as a member of the defense or 
prosecution team. He said he was "a good friend of O.J.'s and Shapiro's." 
</P>
<P>
 When deputies asked Shapiro about that, the defense attorney said: "I've never 
seen him in my life," and the man was hustled out. Searching for Clues 
</P>
<P>
 A Portion of the search warrant obtained by Los Angeles police to search the 
home of O.J. Simpson after the deaths of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Lyle 
Goldman.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 40 NEW 
CHARGES FILED AGAINST SERIAL RAPE SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forty additional charges were filed Thursday against a security guard who 
allegedly abducted women from outside trendy restaurants and sexually assaulted 
them.  
</P>
<P>
 The total number of alleged victims of Sean Patrick Mitchell, 33, now stands 
at 16 and at least two more could be added, Deputy Dist. Atty.Beatriz Donoghue 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The defendant, who is being held without bail, was initially charged with 
assaulting a dozen women over a four-week period ending in June. 
</P>
<P>
 He pleaded not guilty to 90 counts of kidnaping for robbery, kidnaping for 
sexual purposes, attempted kidnaping for robbery, attempted kidnaping for 
sexual purposes, second-degree robbery, forcible oral copulation, forcible 
rape, sodomy and attempted sodomy. The new charges are similar, Donoghue said.  
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, who runs his own security company, was purportedly off-duty at the 
time of the alleged attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 He allegedly used a 9-millimeter handgun while abducting the women as they 
left upscale restaurants and other nightspots in Hollywood, West Hollywood and 
the Wilshire district. He generally approached women in their 20s as they were 
either getting into their cars or already in them, Donoghue said.  
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, who was arrested June 8, allegedly kidnaped some of his victims in 
pairs. He would lock one in another room while raping the other, police said.

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; THE PROS, CONS OF PADDLING 
FOR GRAFFITI TAGGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inspired by the recent caning of Michael Fay, the American teen-ager convicted 
of graffiti vandalism in Singapore, Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) has 
authored a bill allowing judges to punish taggers by ordering them to be 
spanked with a wooden paddle. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill was approved Tuesday by the Assembly Public Safety Committee and will 
now go on to a second committee hearing. It then will be voted on by the full 
Assembly floor and, if approved, will be sent to the Senate. Under the bill, 
judges can order parents to paddle an offending tagger under the age of 18 with 
a wooden paddle between four and 10 times. If parents refuse, then the bailiff 
would be required to administer the public paddling. 
</P>
<P>
 Should graffiti vandals be paddled? 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Parachini, public affairs director of the American Civil Liberties 
Union:  
</P>
<P>
 "The Conroy Bill is a shameless publicity stunt that has no prayer of 
deterring the gang members that produce the graffiti we all fear. What Mr. 
Conroy wants to do is substitute the constitution of Singapore for the 
Constitution of the United States and not only would that compromise our system 
of government, but it would have no effect on the problem he identifies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Singapore constitution permits severe corporal punishment and that is at 
odds with the American system. . . . The unfortunate thing is that there is 
such a rush-hour traffic jam of political opportunism to take advantage of 
people's fear of crime that legislators like Mr. Conroy are trying to outdo 
each other with the outlandishness of their proposals. . . . This only diverts 
attention from the kind of programs that we should be trying to develop." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Horton, member of the Los Angeles Board of Education, who represents part 
of the east San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm against paddling graffiti vandals. I don't think that paddling is a very 
effective way of getting young people to behave in a responsible way and I 
think, if anything, it would simply create more angry young people. . . . What 
we need to do is to find (out what) satisfaction they're not getting out of 
their school and home lives that leads them to want to write on other people's 
walls.  
</P>
<P>
 "If we can give them that satisfaction, then they won't have to write on 
walls. People write on walls to make their mark on the world and if they can 
(they will) make their mark on the world through school or work or some other 
activity that's not destructive to other people's property. They need more 
jobs, more opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Gold, Superior Court Commissioner, Juvenile Court in Sylmar: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think paddling would be a bad idea. I think it would work. It works 
in other places like Singapore and there's no graffiti in Singapore. But I 
don't think that our elected officials would ever let this pass because they 
never listen to the majority of the voters anyway. . . . I say, put it on the 
ballot and let the majority talk. I would vote for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Dingsdale, president of the California State Parent Teachers Assn.: 
</P>
<P>
 "Our position is to oppose that bill and to let that committee know that 
corporal punishment may temporarily suppress them, but it doesn't teach them 
new behavior and that's what we need to do. Clinical research backs us up on 
that. That type of punishment does not promote relearning. What does is working 
with children where they are praised and rewarded and helping them to establish 
a positive self-concept. . . . In our minds, teaching violence is not the way 
to solve these problems."

 This weapon was captured on film: When we turned on our TV set at 9:25 
Thursday morning, stations 2, 4, 5, 7, 9 and 11 were covering the evidentiary 
hearing in the O.J. Simpson murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel 13 -- "very independent 13," as it likes to call itself -- was content 
to be showing a "Tom and Jerry" cartoon. But it was exciting, too. When we 
tuned in, two mice were being chased by a gun-waving cat.

 Oh, Mann's! L.A. may be getting another world-class tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Coliseum officials, thankful for the political support they have received, are 
considering inviting members of the City Council and the County Board of 
Supervisors to leave their handprints and signatures in the concrete of the 
renovated stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasn't there a place in Hollywood that had a similar idea? No matter. 
</P>
<P>
 We can imagine people coming from all over the world to match their paw prints 
with those of such charismatic celebrities as Marvin Braude and Mike 
Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if it doesn't catch on with the tourist buses, we think the monument 
will be worth it if only because it kept the politicos' hands out of the 
taxpayers' wallets for a few minutes.

 The devil you say: A bungalow on the Cal State Northridge campus has attracted 
some attention with its nameplate, which lists a three-digit number that also 
denotes Satan in the Bible's Book of Revelation (see photo). One day, recalled

JIMMY MAURA; ACTOR, COSTUMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jimmy Maura, a former stage actor and extra who found a second career as a 
costumer on such television programs as "Married . . . With Children" and 
"Silver Spoons," has died at a Culver City hospice. He was 51. 
</P>
<P>
 Maura, a former Sherman Oaks resident who moved to Los Angeles several years 
ago, died Wednesday of cancer, said his niece, Gina Maura of Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 According Marti Squyres, costume designer for "Married . . . With Children," 
Maura joined the Fox sitcom as a costumer several years ago. His 
responsibilities included dressing the show's male actors, including Ed 
O'Neill, who portrays Al Bundy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took a lot of pride in what he did and how he handled the actors," Squyres 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Born James Martin Maura in Rome, N. Y., he left home following high school to 
pursue an acting career in New York. After appearing in several productions, 
including "Teahouse of the August Moon," he moved to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He studied acting in Pasadena and appeared as an extra on such programs as 
"Archie Bunker's Place" before becoming a costumer. Prior to "Married . . . 
With Children," Maura worked on such series as "Silver Spoons" and "Rachel 
Gunn, R. N." 
</P>
<P>
 Maura is survived by his mother, Lucille Swarmer of Satsuma, Fla., and two 
brothers, Peter Maura of Rome, N. Y., and Luke Maura of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be no funeral, although a private family service will be held at a 
later date. Aftercare California Cremation & Burial Society in Van Nuys is 
handling arrangements.

POLITICAL BRIEFING : BEILENSON DECISION LEADS GROUP TO RESCIND INVITATION TO 
SYBERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 SOUNDS OF SILENCE: Forget that first mano-a-mano debate between U.S. Rep. 
Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) and attorney Richard Sybert, the GOP 
challenger, set for July 7 at the Warner Center Marriott and sponsored by the 
Valley Jewish Business Leaders Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson nixed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson's staff said their boss didn't know it was a debate that he was 
getting into. He thought it was a solo flight, a chance for him to schmooze 
with local Jewish business leaders alone and unencumbered. When it turned into 
a debate, the congressman did an about-face. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a problem with it," said Michael Turner, public relations director for 
the event. "He wasn't going to show up if it was a debate, so we had to 
dis-invite Sybert." 
</P>
<P>
 How this situation arose in the first place is still not exactly known, "but 
it is rather embarrassing," Turner conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Craig Miller, a Beilenson political adviser, Beilenson is more 
than happy to debate Sybert, "but we're not going to allow Sybert to turn every 
appearance the congressman makes in the Valley into a debate." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, James Vaughn, Sybert's campaign manager, said the incident shows 
that Beilenson is "already ducking the debates" he had promised to have with 
his GOP challenger. "This is typical Beilenson -- saying one thing and doing 
another." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 LABOR PAINS: Their vote of support for the North American Free Trade Agreement 
is haunting U.S. Reps. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City) and Beilenson. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, anti-NAFTA die-hards effectively vetoed a move by delegates of 
the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, to endorse Berman and 
Beilenson's reelection bids this fall. Before the delegates was a 
recommendation to endorse the pair made by the federation's political wing and 
its new secretary-treasurer, Jim Wood. But the recommendation failed to win the 
two-thirds voting approval needed for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 According to dissident Carl Kessler, a veteran federation delegate from the 
International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the rejection was 
unprecedented. The delegates routinely adopt the recommendations of the 
federation's political wing, he said. "I've been here since 1959 and it's never 
happened before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood, who recently replaced Bill Robertson as federation leader, blamed 
himself for tactical errors that contributed to the defeat of the proposal. A 
union endorsement of the congressmen may still be forthcoming when the matter 
is taken up again at a state convention of labor unions later this month(, Wood 
said. But he refused to make a prediction. "This issue is real emotional, and I 
wouldn't want to predict an outcome," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Berman and Beilenson have effortlessly won the valuable 
endorsements of such union organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 MUCH ADO: Two mailings in recent months that went to several thousand 
residents living outside his district have rekindled speculation that state 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) is casting about for new political worlds 
to conquer after term limits force an end to his Assembly career in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The Katz mailings -- one alerting blind, disabled and senior citizens about 
tax rebates available to them, the other warning quake victims to beware of 
unscrupulous building contractors -- reached some constituents of state 
Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills), who represents the adjoining 38th 
Assembly District, state officials have confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Boland was subsequently moved to question whether it was proper for Katz, who 
reigns over the 39th Assembly District, to spend tax dollars sending mail into 
her district. 
</P>
<P>
 But what really is at issue here is that some of the folks who got the mailing 
(and do not live in the 39th District) reside in Los Angeles City Councilman 
Hal Bernson's district. 
</P>
<P>
 And that, coupled with previous reports that Katz has been looking at the 
possibility of running for Bernson's seat, raised some political eyebrows. The 
mailings, the speculation went, was a sign that Katz was trying to ingratiate 
himself with voters in Bernson's district as a prelude to challenging the 
incumbent, whose term expires next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he did not go so far in his own analysis of the situation, Boland's 
chief field deputy, Scott Wilk, remarked that the mailings were "suspicious" 
and the explanations that they were done inadvertently were "unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Azarloza, press deputy to U.S. Rep. Howard (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa 
Clarita), who got one of the mailings at his own home (he lives in Bernson's 
district but not in Katz's), said it is obvious to him that Katz is eyeing 
Bernson's seat. "He's definitely shopping around for a place to go after term 
limits, and Bernson's seat is one he's looking at," Azarloza said. 
</P>
<P>
 With Bernson's reign troubled by his support of the huge Porter Ranch 
development and bedeviled by questions about his use of campaign funds on high 
dining and foreign travel, "I think Richard thinks he can walk in there and 
pull Republicans and Democrats and beat Bernson," Azarloza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz says speculation about his two mailings into Bernson's district are 
ludicrous. "These people ought to get a life," Katz said. "Right now, all I'm 
doing is looking at getting reelected to my 39th District." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz claims the mailers went outside his district because of a computer 
glitch. The constituents reached by the disputed mailing actually were in his 
old 39th District before the 1992 reapportionment plan moved them into Boland's 
district, he said. Someone in the Assembly Rules Committee failed to update his 
constituent mailing after reapportionment. There was no chicanery or ulterior 
designs involved, Katz insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a mystery to us how it happened," added Bob Connelly, chief 
administrative officer to the Rules Committee, which maintains Assembly 
members' computer files. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Bernson accepts Katz's explanation. "Richard and I have a good 
relationship and I'm not going to read anything into this situation," the 
councilman said this week.

JAPAN -- PLEASE WAIT TILL THE FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan's new odd couple, the Socialists and the conservative Liberal Democratic 
Party, is a puzzle both inside and outside the country. If there is any 
consensus on this bizarre new coalition government, it is that confusion reigns 
in Tokyo as the first Socialist since 1947 takes over as prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomiichi Murayama, the new prime minister, is not a strong figure. Indeed, 
some speculate that he got the job precisely because his government would be 
unstable and might fall, thus precipitating an election before the drawing of 
new, more representative districts later this year. A snap election, before the 
electoral reform is in place, would be a throwback to the antediluvian past. 
Murayama's predecessor, Tsutumu Hata, resigned Saturday before a scheduled 
no-confidence vote in Parliament; Hata, patriotically, acted to avoid an early 
national election. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama's ascension out of nowhere is being interpreted by some as a cynical 
move by the LDP to align with its longtime foe, the left-leaning Socialists, to 
restore itself to power after being ousted last year. Murayama's new Cabinet is 
dominated by LDP figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again political chaos engulfs Japan and portends continued policy 
paralysis as the nation faces dicey U.S-Japan trade talks, stalled efforts to 
deregulate the Japanese economy and a volatile North Korea situation. Murayama 
has no policy-making, international or even Cabinet experience. His Socialist 
Party is known as protectionist, isolationist and an avowed opponent of 
sanctions against North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's hope those policies won't be in evidence when Murayama represents Japan 
at next week's meeting of the leading seven industrial nations in Naples. He is 
scheduled to meet with President Clinton before the gathering to discuss the 
North Korea issue and U.S.-Japan trade. The Socialists have opposed various 
Washington-backed proposals for change in Japan's economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama would do much to mitigate his weak domestic and international 
standing by not pressing for any policy reversals. He has been known to bend 
with the political winds; can he hold on and spare Tokyo a premature election? 
It would be better for Japan, and for the West, if the next election followed 
the historic electoral reforms in the fall. Only then might Japan realize some 
genuine political realignment and thus stability.

HOUSING WATCH; HOME RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acquiring a home is no easy task for first-time buyers, especially for those 
searching for houses in low- and middle-income neighborhoods in Los Angeles. 
However, the hurdle is almost insurmountable for those who faithfully pay their 
rent and other bills but do not have the kind of conventional credit that 
lenders prefer. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of this longstanding obstacle, homeownership has eluded many who have 
kept their finances in good order. This is an economic disparity that is 
morally wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 That could change under a new program called Home Works!, Los Angeles' first 
major city program aimed at first-time home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Housing Department and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., known as 
Freddie Mac, have teamed to help as many as 700 families qualify for loans to 
purchase and renovate homes in designated Los Angeles neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership means that the city Housing Department will be able to 
leverage $7 million in federal funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development into $100 million in home loans from private lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has two commendable goals: to stabilize and revive parts of the 
city through an infusion of new home owners and to help first-time buyers 
qualify for loans and develop rehabilitation plans if their newly bought homes 
need repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles is the test city in this special effort. The best compliment for 
the program would be for other cities to copy it. Let's hope Home Works! works.

IT'S A LONG, LONG WAY TO SACRAMENTO; FEDERAL QUAKE HELP PROMISED; WHERE'S STATE 
AID? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, had it 
right. "We do not want to see a situation here like what they had in the 
aftermath of Hurricane Andrew," he said this week in referring to the parts of 
Florida's Dade County that became abandoned after that disaster. The 
development of the "ghost towns" slowed recovery to a crawl in Florida; that 
must not be allowed to happen in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently this page published specific suggestions in regard to the 13 
earthquake ghost towns that have appeared in the San Fernando Valley, Hollywood 
and the Mid-City area. Now the federal government has promised to act. If 
Washington follows through on its promises, there indeed will be cause for a 
rousing cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 We wanted the Small Business Administration to give priority to loan 
applications from building owners in the ghost towns. SBA Administrator Erskine 
Bowles says he will do that, and more. Also, he says 17,000 loan requests that 
previously were turned down will be reviewed and that his employees will revive 
11,000 requests that were withdrawn by applicants, often in frustration over 
the slowness of the process. The promised "fast-track" treatment is crucial 
because some owners cannot proceed with even the most basic steps of rebuilding 
unless they receive federal loans. Without such help, Los Angeles city 
officials had made clear, building owners were going to have to foot some of 
the bill for securing and patrolling their quake-damaged properties. Because 
many buildings have been damaged further by trespassers, that might have been 
too much for some owners to bear. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Art Agnos, San Francisco mayor when the 1989 Loma Prieta quake 
occurred and now regional administrator for the federal Department of Housing 
and Urban Development, had it right, too: "What's really absent is the state's 
checkbook. Without it, we'll still be short in terms of completing the 
recovery." That is not only sadly true, it's downright infuriating.  
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature could have handled the ghost-town and 
other earthquake problems through prompt implementation of a temporary 
quarter-cent sales tax increase dedicated to recovery. Instead, they relied on 
a proposed earthquake bond issue (1A) -- which failed at the polls last month. 
Now, the governor and the Legislature are bogged down in state budget matters, 
and earthquake recovery remains unaddressed. Maybe that's why it seems that 
Washington is just up the road a piece these days, while Sacramento seems a 
continent away.

LOW-COST HOUSING AND RENT CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a former executive director of the Berkeley Rent Stabilization Board, I 
found Prof. Peter Dreier's column ("Rent Control Myths and Landlord Money," 
Commentary, June 17) severely flawed and misleading in his criticism of 
Assemblyman Jim Costa's (D-Hanford) rent reform legislation. AB 1320 is a 
bipartisan effort to solve the problems of owners and tenants created by 
vacancy controls, the most extreme form of rent control. Contrary to Dreier's 
claims, AB 1320 helps those residents whom vacancy control was initially 
intended to help. 
</P>
<P>
 In Berkeley, census data shows that the number of rental housing units 
available for families with children, minorities, lower income, less-educated 
residents and college students significantly decreased in the 1980s, and the 
same is true for Santa Monica. Meanwhile, rental households with higher income, 
higher educated professional workers have increased. This is fact. Dreier's 
anecdotal musings are not. 
</P>
<P>
 AB 1320 will prevent vacancy controls on new housing and single family homes, 
and thus spur construction in the unfortunate few cities with the burdensome 
regulation. Significantly, AB 1320 will also do away with the bloated, 
expensive and inefficient taxpayer-financed rent control boards that inflict 
the pain of vacancy control on their city's economies. 
</P>

 After reading the article, one can tell that Dreier is a professor with his 
head in the clouds of academia and does not know whereof he speaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Dreier, take a drive around any city in Orange County (we do not have rent 
control). There are "for rent" signs on almost every block. Read the rental ads 
-- move-in specials everywhere. These are decent buildings in decent areas. I 
am charging the rates I got three years ago, because we are governed by a

 Re "Housing Providers Miss Golden Chance," June 21: 
</P>
<P>
 How pathetic! While developers and even mom-and-pop outfits hustle to buy 
these bargain-priced foreclosed apartment buildings, relying on private 
financing and investment at an average price of $37,000 a unit, taxpayer 
dollars are freely spent at a rate of $150,000 a unit for "low-income 
dwellings." 
</P>
<P>
 To top it all, various groups, including government agencies, cannot find a 
way to cut through the inefficiency and compete with the swiftness of the 
private sector. Their only solution is efforts to slow down the sales by banks 
(at a cost to the banks) so that government agencies can take their customary 
sweet time for approvals upon approvals. In the meantime, we taxpayers have to 
pay a 400% premium for those units and the direct beneficiaries have to wait 
for several years longer to occupy them. 
</P>
<P>
 One has to wonder how the public can be convinced to trust any health plan 
involving the government in any phase of its operation. Now it is not our 
shelter that is at stake, it is our lives!

FAMILY VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the words of O.J. Simpson, wife battering is a "family affair." In fact, as 
the roaring headlines and news stories attest, it is a "societal affair" and a 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past decade, as a California licensed marriage and family therapist I 
have worked with several hundred wife batterers utilizing group therapy methods 
in psychiatric hospitals and a prison. And over the past year I have developed 
an outline for a demonstration-research project for dealing more effectively 
with these offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, in summary, would involve setting up a male batterer shelter 
rather than a female battered wife shelter. First offenders who assault their 
spouses would be placed, by court order, in the live-in facility for a 
six-month period. They would work their usual job during the day, and attend 
mandatory group therapy sessions to deal with their deviant behavior every 
evening and weekends. Their paychecks would, by court order, go to their wife 
and children. In the first three months of their six-month sentence they would 
not be allowed to have any contact with their family. In the last three months, 
their wives, if interested in reconciliation, would attend a weekly session 
with their husbands. If the husband broke any rules of the program, he would be 
subject to a six-month to one-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The project could have the following positive effects: 1) The wife and 
children would stay in their own home with an income, rather than being 
punished by being forced to flee to a woman's shelter; 2) the batterers would 
be punished by the denial of their full freedom, and being in the company of 
their peers who come from all socioeconomic strata of society; 3) in the group 
sessions, the batterer would be forced to deal with his usual problem of 
"denial," and they would be forced to confront the emotional context and dire 
consequences of their criminal behavior; 4) in role-playing sessions they would 
reverse roles, and feel how painful it is to be in the role of the wife-victim; 
and 5) they would be forced to confront the impact of their behavior on their 
children.

KATHLEEN BROWN

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I noted your June 22 article, "Brown Ties Death Penalty Stance to Upbringing, 
Faith," regarding Kathleen Brown's disclosure that her position on the death 
penalty was formulated in large part because of her early upbringing as a Roman 
Catholic. No doubt she must also have been made aware of the church's position 
on abortion as well as the sanctity of a marriage blessed by the church.Those 
of us that adhere to the beliefs of our religion as a whole and not just those 
positions that are politically advantageous or, as in the case of divorce, the 
easy way to resolve life's difficulties, are saddened. I am sure that most 
practicing Catholics are angry to see Brown stoop to this expediency. 
</P>
<P>
 As a lifelong practicing Catholic, I would ask Brown to leave my religion out 
of this debate and devise a less repugnant deceit.

 I was pleased to see your extensive coverage of Kathleen Brown's position on 
the death penalty. As an opponent of capital punishment, I had hoped that Brown 
would translate her entirely sensible opposition to the barbaric, biased and 
unnecessary practice into political action. Unfortunately, it appears that 
moral and capable people like Brown are pressured into submission by those who 
cling to the unsupportable belief that sanctioned killing of a few dozen 
murderers here or there is a relevant response to the crime problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's lock up murderers for true life -- without parole -- and save the 
millions in taxpayers' money being wasted on these very few capital punishment 
cases.  
</P>
<P>
 I plan to vote for Brown despite her unwillingness to become a politician who 
truly leads, but I can't help hoping for more.

HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Yes, We Can Rebuild the Country" (Commentary, June 16), Andrew Young 
clearly pushes for a forceful return of the Aristide government. He envisions 
the return of Haitians from abroad with skills and resources.Young didn't carry 
this thought far enough. The forceful retaking of Haiti should be by these same 
Haitians with fighting skills. It is only right that if blood is to be shed to 
return democracy (when did they ever have it?) it should be Haitian blood. We 
should help train them, equip them and wish them luck. 
</P>

 Recently, the situation in Haiti has become more and more disturbing. Although 
I feel that something must be done, I do not feel that an embargo is the best 
solution. This will not only hurt many of the innocent people in Haiti, it will 
also force them to destroy what is left of their once-beautiful island. 
</P>
<P>
 I have never been to Haiti, but a friend of mine has told me about what he has 
seen there. In the month that he spent doing volunteer work at a hospital, he 
was able to view the country. He claimed that the people who lived there were 
not concerned with the environment, but the survival of themselves and their 
families. Because of this attitude, which is natural considering the 
circumstances, much of Haiti's beautiful jungle has been destroyed. Continuing 
the embargo may force Haitians to destroy the few natural resources and natural 
beauty they have left.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, experience shows that embargoes have little effect on 
dictatorships, since those in power are not affected by them and the rest of 
the population is suppressed, unarmed, and has little power, if any.

 George Will demands the reinstitution of the stigma upon "young women who, by 
behaving irresponsibly, deserve a badge of dishonor" for becoming pregnant out 
of wedlock (Column Right, June 19). 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, as this piece ran on Father's Day, he never once sees fit to 
mention either the word father or to suggest that similar stigmas, penalties 
and dishonors be heaped upon the young men who bear equal responsibility for 
these pregnancies. Although I share Will's concern with the number of poorly 
parented children we have in the U.S. today, I do not share his opinion that 
singling out and scapegoating women is a solution to the problem.

PERSPECTIVE ON JAPAN; 'EMPTY CENTER' ALLOWS FOR SUCCESS; THE REVOLVING DOOR OF 
PRIME MINISTERS HAS HAD LITTLE EFFECT, SINCE TOP DECISIONS ARE MADE 
COLLECTIVELY BY OTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By C. Scott Littleton, C. Scott Littleton is a professor of anthropology at 
Occidental College and currently a senior Fulbright researcher at Waseda 
University, Tokyo. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At first glance, Japanese politics appears to be in total chaos. Prime 
ministers come and go with a frequency rivaled only by that of Italy. The 
Hosokawa government lasted barely six months, and the Hata government recently 
resigned after less than two months in office. To make matters even more 
complicated, the conservative Liberal Democratic Party and the left-leaning 
Social Democratic Party of Japan have just joined forces to elect SDPJ 
President Tomiichi Murayama as Japan's 52nd prime minister. How long this 
arrangement will last is anybody's guess. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as anyone who knows Japan -- or who has followed the upward progress of 
the yen in recent weeks -- will readily attest, the country continues to 
function at peak efficiency, despite the absence of a strong political center. 
Essential services -- telecommunications, the transportation network, health 
care and education (at least at the primary level) -- are still as good or 
better than in any other first-world country, including the United States. To 
be sure, Japan is still mired in a post-bubble-economy recession, and 
unemployment has risen sharply in recent months. But exports are up, and life 
goes on with few if any real disruptions, despite the daily political soap 
opera that has come to dominate the media. 
</P>
<P>
 How can this be? How can a country lacking a strong political center manage to 
do as well as Japan has done? It would seem to violate all of our cherished 
theories about how modern nation-states are supposed to work. But if one looks 
closely at the way the rest of Japanese society works, from neighborhood 
associations to business management, one finds that strong "centers" are 
conspicuous by their absence. What emerges is a phenomenon I call the "empty 
center": the absence of strong, active leadership in the Western sense of the 
word. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the paradoxes of Japanese social organization is the clear separation 
between decision-making and deference. The person at the apex of a given 
hierarchy in this most hierarchical of nations is rarely the one who makes 
important decisions. Rather, those decision are made collectively by persons in 
the middle ranks; the person at the top, although exaggeratedly deferred to 
with a superabundance of deep bows, hyper-polite language and ritualized gifts, 
is generally expected to react rather than act. Once a decision has been 
arrived at in a quasi-democratic way by extensive informal consultations among 
the persons concerned, the "leader" simply adds his (or her) stamp of approval 
and announces the new policy, product, rule or whatever. The leader is thus an 
"empty center," a necessary vacuum, as it were. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tokyo neighborhood associations I have studied, most of which are 
concerned with the organization and management of a local Shinto shrine 
festival, are prime examples of "empty-centered" systems. A decision taken a 
few years ago, to allow women to carry portable shrines during the festival, is 
a case in point. The decision was made by consultation among the members of 
several interlocking neighborhood associations long before it was presented to 
the president of the residents association. He simply acknowledged the fact and 
formally invited the young women to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been, of course, some major exceptions to this rule. The first 
shogun, Yoritomo (1147-1199) was one; so was Hideyoshi (1536-1598), who aspired 
to the Chinese imperial throne. And a few modern business leaders, like Akio 
Morita, the co-founder of Sony, and Panasonic's Konosuke Matsushita, have also 
been forceful leaders when the occasion demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the most part, whether in industry, neighborhood associations or even 
the military, to say nothing of modern politics, the "empty center" has reigned 
supreme. 
</P>
<P>
 When all is said and done, it doesn't matter who becomes prime minister, any 
more than it does who becomes emperor -- perhaps the quintessential example 
since antiquity of a Japanese "empty center." Thus the hierarchies continue to 
consult and to make collective decisions, and the system not only survives but 
prospers. As long as somebody occupies the central bench in the Diet, Japan 
will continue to thrive.

COLUMN RIGHT/ VIRGINIA I. POSTREL: HEALTH-CARE TRUTHS AND CONSEQUENCES; THE 
SALES PITCH FROM WASHINGTON WILL SOUND PROMISING, BUT IT WON'T DELIVER. 
</P>

<P>
 The health-care debate is becoming ever more encrusted with lies. And, 
contrary to the Clinton Administration's rhetoric, most of the lies aren't 
coming from insurance-industry commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the politicians undertake an overhaul of the health-care industry, they 
owe the American people the courtesy of telling us the truth. They can start 
with the following: 
</P>
<P>
 Truth No. 1: A "trigger" is a mandate. Meet Washington's favorite lie: that 
doing something under threat of legal sanctions is doing it voluntarily. Thus, 
we get "voluntary" quotas on Japanese auto imports, "voluntary" labeling of 
music albums and TV programs and "voluntary" price controls. Now, instead of 
voting for explicit mandates, some congressional "moderates" want a mandatory 
system that will automatically take effect if 96% of the population doesn't 
have insurance by 2000. It's a buck-passing trick that seriously underestimates 
the public's intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth No. 2: "Universal coverage" is a tax on youth. He may be our first MTV 
President, but Bill Clinton is no friend of Generation X. It is true, as he and 
the First Lady often remark, that uninsured young people who unexpectedly need 
expensive medical care may pass the cost of that care onto someone else. It is 
also true, in many cases, that the someone else is their family, not the 
general public. In forgoing insurance, young, healthy people are making a 
rational calculation; they are in fact very unlikely to need medical attention 
they can't cover out of their paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandatory insurance may solve the free-rider problem but it also will impose a 
substantial tax on young people who aren't earning much to begin with, who 
already pay huge Social Security and Medicare taxes and who haven't had time to 
accumulate the assets that cushion even low-income older workers. An honest 
approach to mandatory insurance would match this new tax with a cut in Social 
Security and Medicare taxes on young workers. After all, if stamping out free 
riders is the goal, why are young people footing the medical bills for the 
over-65 crowd? 
</P>
<P>
 Truth No. 3: Expanding health insurance means expanding health-care spending. 
The President says giving everyone health insurance "goes to the heart of 
whether we can get our own economic house in order." Clinton sees national 
health insurance as a way to cut the monstrous cost of Medicare and Medicaid. 
He is seriously deluded. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1971 to 1990, government health-care spending went up more than 2 1/2 
times faster than private spending -- and for good reason. When you tell people 
something is free, they demand more of it. A graph of U.S. health-care spending 
shows a huge jump when Medicare kicks in. We can expect a similar spike if 
"universal coverage" becomes law. Remember, in 1965 it was estimated that 
Medicare would cost $12 billion by 1990, allowing for inflation. It actually 
cost nearly 10 times that much. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth No. 4: Cutting costs and imposing controls means stopping technological 
progress. What we want, ultimately, is what might be called "Star Trek" 
medicine -- the ability to look inside the body and mend problems without 
traumatic surgery. Medicine is moving in that direction. But 
government-controlled health-care systems tend to impose uniformity, stamping 
out innovation. And health economists generally agree that new technology is 
the biggest factor driving up costs. If we're all footing the bill, the easiest 
decision is that newfangled ideas are too expensive. And if the American market 
goes, the whole world will suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth No. 5: There's no such thing as "universal coverage." Every health-care 
system provides medical attention to some patients and denies it to others. A 
Clinton-style system would limit care not by the ability to pay (or to find 
someone else willing to foot the bill) but by a political judgment of the 
patient's worthiness, including the urgency of the need, the expense of the 
treatment, the likelihood of a positive outcome and the effectiveness of the 
relevant lobbyists. When Oregon decrees that its Medicaid program won't cover 
doctor's-office visits for the common cold, it is making a rationally 
justifiable decision. But it is not offering "universal coverage." There is no 
such thing as a free doctor visit. That's one truth you won't hear on Capitol 
Hill.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; ONE FOR THE WISH LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Grand Jury has its offices in the 11-story county courthouse 
in Santa Ana, so it is understandable that its members would be concerned about 
security there. After all, the facility houses scores of criminals every day, 
as well as bitter antagonists in civil trials. But the panel's suggestion that 
airport-style security devices be installed at building entrances really must 
remain on the "wish list." The problem is money. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury said last week that installing six X-ray machines and metal 
detectors of the type found at airports would cost $485,000. That is not a 
large sum by itself. The real burden would come in annual operating costs, an 
estimated $732,000. That is too expensive for a county battling budget 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The report did not address security concerns at courts in Westminster, Newport 
Beach, Fullerton and Laguna Niguel, but judges and lawyers in those buildings 
surely could be expected to request the same protection provided in Santa Ana. 
The only court that has the airport-style screening machines is Juvenile Court 
in Orange. That building, which also houses Family Court, opened two years ago, 
and the extra security was part of the design. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors commendably has done what it could for court 
security. It recently approved $350,000 for measures that will include magnetic 
door locks and courtroom security cameras. Portable metal detectors have been 
used outside courtrooms in which gang trials were taking place. 
</P>
<P>
 While the county marshal's office protects the court building, the Sheriff's 
Department has helped matters outside by increasing patrols around the Civic 
Center government complex, which includes the court. That was a response to 
complaints by county employees of harassment by transients. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles and other counties have installed airport-style security in some 
courts but not others, and Orange County has been wise to make improvements it 
can afford but not go overboard on spending. If the money shows up some day, 
the extra security will be worth considering.

NEWSWIRE: HARDING LOSES TITLE AND IS BANNED FOR LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Figure Skating Assn. finally got its chance to pronounce judgment on 
Tonya Harding Thursday, and the verdict was harsh.  
</P>
<P>
 She was stripped of the national championship she won in Detroit on Jan. 8 and 
was banned from the association for life. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision in Colorado Springs by a five-member disciplinary panel appointed 
by the association was unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding's actions surrounding the Jan. 6 attack on her rival, Nancy Kerrigan, 
"evidence a clear disregard for fairness, good sportsmanship and ethical 
behavior," the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
 William Hybl, the former U.S. Olympic Committee president who chaired the 
panel, said Harding's admission March 16 that she had conspired to hinder 
prosecution of those responsible for the attack was the most important factor 
in the decision. But the panel believed Harding's involvement went much 
further. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding denies that she knew of the attack before it occurred, but Hybl said 
the panel was convinced otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a cumulative effect of a lot of evidence," he said. "I will tell 
you that various records -- bank records, phone records -- and the way they 
came together to establish a case really were very important to this panel." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding remained in Portland, Ore., her hometown, and did not participate in 
the two-day hearing that ended with Thursday's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is difficult when you don't have a person here to defend themselves or you 
don't have their counsel," Hybl said. "We went to special efforts, I believe, 
to make sure that the athlete in this case had everything in evidence that we 
had at our disposal that would be exonerating in any way." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding has 30 days to appeal to the USFSA executive committee. Under the 
organization's bylaws, if she does appeal and is not satisfied, she can then 
appeal to an independent arbitrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Weaver, Harding's attorney, indicated that an appeal was unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been her decision up to this point not to contest these proceedings, but 
she's made no final decision on the appeal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver issued a statement on Harding's behalf saying she was disappointed by 
the decision. He said Harding was not surprised, however, because she did not 
appear at the hearing to defend herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "She categorically denies the statements of Jeff Gillooly (Harding's former 
husband and convicted planner of the attack) and others relied upon by the 
hearing panel that she had any prior knowledge of or participated in the 
assault on Nancy Kerrigan," Weaver said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonya Harding is going on with her life. Whether she skates publicly again 
remains to be seen. She is grateful for the support and faith of her many 
fans." 
</P>
<P>
 The association considers the 1994 national championship vacant and its 
executive committee will decide whether anyone will be named to fill it, USFSA

 A woman who claims Jason Kidd fathered her child has filed suit against him, 
asking for $10,000 a month in child support payments.

apartment.

 The suit said that Kidd's paternity was established May 26 in San Francisco 
Superior Court. The baby was born in November, and Brown said she had to quit 
her job as an airline reservations clerk because Kidd refused to pay for child

LATE GOAL GIVES NIGERIA WINNING EDGE; GROUP D: AMOKACHI SCORES IN FIFTH MINUTE 
OF INJURY TIME IN 2-0 VICTORY OVER GREECE, ENABLING AFRICANS TO WIN TITLE ON 
GOAL DIFFERENTIAL.

<P>
 Daniel Amokachi scored in the fifth minute of injury time, giving Nigeria a 
2-0 victory over Greece on Thursday night that clinched the World Cup Group D 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigeria will play Italy in the second round Tuesday at Foxboro Stadium, in 
Foxboro, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 In their Cup finals debut, the Nigerians finished 2-1 in the group, as did 
Argentina and Bulgaria. But the Nigerians had a 6-2 goal differential thanks to 
Amokachi's long shot in the dying seconds. That was better than Bulgaria, which 
beat Argentina, 2-0, Thursday and also got a last-second goal, and Argentina, 
which had 6-3 differentials. 
</P>
<P>
 Amokachi beat two defenders and unleased a 25-yard shot that rocketed into the 
corner of the net. Goalkeeper Peter Rufai did a somersault as the rest of his 
teammates celebrated upfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Seconds later, the whistle sounded to end the game and put Nigeria ahead of 
the Argentines and Bulgarians. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Nigeria and Bulgaria scored in the frantic final five minutes of their 
games to improve their fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigeria had been headed for Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., and a 
meeting with Mexico until the late goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigeria took a 1-0 lead in the second minute of first-half injury time when 
George Finidi softly chipped a shot over goalkeeper Christos Karkamanis. 
</P>
<P>
 That goal came after Nigeria missed two chances earlier in the half, including 
a 30-yard blast off the crossbar by Finidi in the 22nd minute. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was a bit of a moral victory for Greece, which lost its first two 
matches -- to Argentina and Bulgaria -- by identical 4-0 scores. It trailed 
after only five minutes against Argentina and after two minutes against 
Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 But with its third goalkeeper in as many games, Karkamanis, Greece appeared 
more confident, giving Nigeria few chances and creating a few of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Greece twice was denied by Rufai in the last six minutes. Panagiotis 
Tsalouhidis blasted a close-range shot that Rufai got his left hand on, and 
then Rufai smothered a shot by Savas Kofidis after the ensuing corner kick.

 The Oakland Athletics are finding ways to win. But given the way Chuck Finley 
was pitching Wednesday, they didn't figure to pull this one out with a home run 
by the No. 9 hitter who was down in the count 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a weird one," Oakland third baseman Scott Brosius said after his 
ninth-inning shot down the left field line lifted the A's to a 1-0 victory. 
"When I got two strikes, I was just trying to hit the ball up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I hit the ball, I didn't feel anything and I looked up there and said, 
'That ball can get out of here.' I was just hoping it wouldn't hook foul. It 
was probably one of two forkballs he got up all day." JOHN WEYLER

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE MAJORS; CITY GIVES PIRATES $8 MILLION LOAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pittsburgh City Council reluctantly tossed an $8 million rescue line to 
the Pittsburgh Pirates by approving a loan designed to keep the team afloat and 
in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, the council approved a $20 million loan to the team. The money hasn't 
yet been repaid. 
</P>
<P>
 The team, losing as much as $1 million a month, owes a $5.4 million interest 
payment to Citibank in August. It has nearly exhausted a $34 million line of 
credit with the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Pirate president Mark Sauer had said that if the team didn't get the bailout, 
a new Three Rivers Stadium lease and a salary cap, the Pirates could be sold, 
possibly to out-of-town buyers who would relocate the 107-year-old franchise.

 Farmers Win in Fuel Ruling: The Environmental Protection Agency, keeping one 
of President Clinton's campaign promises to the Farm Belt, cleared the way for 
farmers to reap millions of dollars from the introduction of a cleaner-burning 
gasoline. The new oxygenated fuel will be required beginning in January in the 
nation's smoggiest cities.The EPA said it will require that 15% of the 
oxygenate -- rising to 30% in the second year -- be from a renewable source, in 
effect, corn-based ethanol. For now, ethanol is the only renewable fuel that 
can be produced in the volume needed to meet the clean gasoline goals, 
officials conceded. Such a market share for ethanol could mean as much as $1.5 
billion a year to farmers and related businesses, including ethanol 
manufacturers, according to the American Farm Bureau.

 GM Raises 1995 Car, Truck Prices: The company, citing higher costs for safety 
features and substantial enhancements to new models, said it is raising prices 
as much as 12%. The Detroit auto maker normally releases new model prices in 
July, but General Motors Executive Vice President Michael Losh said the 
announcement was made early this year because GM is already shipping some '95 
models. About half of GM's '95 lineup will be completely redone or updated, a 
substantial departure from previous years, when financial problems delayed the 
introduction of new models such as the Chevrolet Blazer, Losh said.

 Executives Checking on Golden Parachutes: A growing economy and heightened 
prospects for mergers and acquisitions have executives scrambling to make sure 
their golden parachutes are in place, according to a survey by consultants 
Towers Perrin. A compensation expert at Towers Perrin said she has been getting 
lots of calls in the last six months from executives who want to make sure that 
if their company is taken over, their so-called change-in-control benefits will 
be available.Companies with cash are likely to buy other companies, the expert 
said. When they do, executives at the acquired companies can quickly be out of 
a job. The thought of that is sending them scurrying to make sure of their 
money in case they have to leave.

 Japan, Germany Urged to Cut Interest Rates: Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen 
called on the two countries to cut their interest rates to help prop up the 
battered dollar. "Obviously, lower interest rates would be of help," Bentsen 
told reporters ahead of the summit of leading industrial nations that will 
convene July 8 through 10 in Naples, Italy.Lower rates would make those 
nations' currencies less lucrative to hold and thus could lure investors back 
to the dollar. It was the first time Bentsen publicly called on those two 
nations to cut interest rates since the dollar's rout began this month. His 
comments heightened speculation that leaders of major industrial nations at the 
summit would try to hatch a joint strategy involving interest rate cuts 
overseas and rate increases in the United States to underpin the dollar.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW SLIDES 42 AS INTEREST RATES SURGE; DOLLAR AT LOW

<P>
 Blue chip stocks suffered another beating Thursday as a surge in long-term 
interest rates threw the Dow Jones industrial average for a huge loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar slid to its third consecutive postwar low against the Japanese yen 
amid fears that the major economic powers won't agree on measures to support 
the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow closed down 42.09 points at 3,624.96, with declining issues leading 
advances by nearly 7 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's selling was concentrated in large-company stocks, and broad market 
indexes ended mixed. The NYSE's composite index fell 1.56 to 245.16. The 
Standard & Poor's composite fell 3.36 to 444.27. But the Nasdaq composite index 
of mostly smaller companies rose 1.95 to 705.96. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Board volume totaled 293.41 million shares, up from Wednesday's 264.43 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury bond yields soared after the Purchasing Management Assn. of Chicago 
said its index of prices paid by purchasing managers rose to 69.7% from 63.6%, 
and its employment index advanced to 58.1% from 57.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the 30-year benchmark bond climbed to 7.60%, up from 7.51% on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Midwest purchasing managers report was examined for clues to a closely 
watched national purchasing managers survey that will be released today. 
</P>
<P>
 It stirred fears of inflation in a market that is already concerned that the 
recent drop in the dollar will force the Federal Reserve Board to tighten 
interest rates when it meets next week. Higher rates would raise corporate 
costs and lure investors away from stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market also got no help from the dollar, which set another new 
postwar low against the Japanese yen.  
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the dollar's problems Thursday were conflicting statements from 
American, Japanese and German officials as to whether the currency's recent 
weakness would be discussed at the Group of Seven meeting in Italy next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts have speculated that the United States and other nations will 
coordinate economic policies to support the dollar, possibly by adjusting 
interest rates to stimulate capital flows to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed in New York at 98.50 yen, down from 98.70 on Wednesday. 
Against the German mark, the dollar rose in New York to 1.588 from 1.586. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks also sank as portfolio managers "rid themselves of stocks they don't 
want in their portfolios at the end of the quarter," said George Pirrone, 
senior trader at Dreyfus Corp. "They're not replacing them today." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Meyer, head of equity trading at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co., said 
investors are getting out of stocks ahead of the long holiday weekend in favor 
of short-term Treasury bonds and cash. The market is closed Monday for the 
Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock and bond markets reacted little to a Commerce Department report that 
personal income rose 0.6% in May, about on target with economists' 
expectations. Consumer spending increased 0.4%, double the 0.2% growth that had 
been expected. 
</P>
<P>
 In another report, the government said orders to factories rose 0.6% in May, a 
bit lower than the expected 0.7% increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a continuation of the same old saga: Weak dollar, strong commodity 
prices, lower bond prices all add up to a soggy stock market," said Jack 
Shaughnessy, director of research at Advest. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 Large-company stocks led the market lower as portfolio managers shed large 
blocks of holdings. Among the 30 components of the Dow industrial index,

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; ARGENTINA 'EARNS' ROSE BOWL BERTH; GROUP 
D: BULGARIA SCORES 2-0 VICTORY AND FINISHES SECOND IN DIVISION. ARGENTINES WILL 
FACE ROMANIA.

 Did Argentina win Thursday night by losing? 
</P>
<P>
 In the crazy and confusing world of World Cup seedings, it appears it did. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing without its legend, Diego Maradona, Argentina came out flat before 
63,998 at the Cotton Bowl and was knocked down by desperate Bulgaria, 2-0, to 
force a change in travel plans for the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina, headed for a Tuesday matchup against dangerous Italy, went from 
first to third in Group D and now plays Romania on Sunday at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Who wouldn't prefer that scenario? 
</P>
<P>
 Nigeria won the group with a last-minute goal in a 2-0 victory over Greece and 
must face the Italians at Foxboro, Mass., on Tuesday. Bulgaria, fighting for a 
berth in the second round, finished second when Nasko Sirakov scored on a 
header in extra time. The Bulgarians play Mexico on Tuesday at East Rutherford, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 But afterward, they simply wanted to savor their country's second -- and 
biggest -- World Cup victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We showed the world our generation of soccer players is one of the best right 
now," said Hristo Stoichkov, who scored the game's first goal in the 61st 
minute. "Bulgaria should be very proud of us." 
</P>
<P>
 About 30,000 watched the game on four television screens in Sofia's town 
square and were partying throughout the night, Bulgarian reporters said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was much to celebrate, considering Bulgaria entered this World Cup 
without a victory in five tournaments. But it broke the spell by defeating 
Greece, and looked inspired against Argentina, which earlier in the day learned 
that Maradona was banned for a positive drug test. 
</P>
<P>
 Midfielder Zlatko Iankov downplayed Maradona's absence, saying: "Football is 
played with 11 players, not one." 
</P>
<P>
 But Maradona, 33, is the soul of Argentine soccer and his team, although more 
skilled than Bulgaria, lacked drive and hunger Thursday night. No doubt the 
players were emotionally drained from the day's proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe it was Argentina playing," said Maradona, who watched the 
game from a hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona said he wanted to cry for Argentina, but only in private. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice World Cup champions, Argentina also could not believe what transpired on 
a humid evening in Dallas. Bulgaria needed at least a tie to advance to the 
second round for only the second time. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it dominated play with a feisty defense that could cost them against 
Mexico because three starters will be lost to yellow cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Trifon Ivanov, Iankov and Tsanko Tzvetanov got their second yellow cards of 
the first round and drew automatic one-game suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Tzvetanov got both of his Thursday night and was ejected. But even the man 
advantage for the final 25 minutes did not help Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 "After this defeat, it is very difficult for the team to recognize what really 
happened," Fernando Redondo said. "There is nothing to say about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Coach Alfio Basile was talking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their spirits were low," he said. "Maradona does so much for us. He is our 
leader on the field. It's a great impact not to have him. We all love him very 
much, but we have to go on." 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina will not go far, even against Romania, if it does not correct its 
lackluster play. 
</P>
<P>
 It outshot Bulgaria, 20-10, but the players rarely had serious threats. 
Without Maradona to direct the offense from the midfield, Argentina stalled on 
the wings. And once Claudio Caniggia left the match in the 22nd minute 
complaining of an injury to his left big toe, the once-explosive offense 
staggered. 
</P>
<P>
 But give Bulgaria some of the credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy when your players counterattack," Iankov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria's first goal caught Argentina unaware after a failed corner kick left 
the Argentine defense on the offensive side of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoichkov, one of the world's best strikers, made a nice breakaway. He scored 
after getting a beautiful pass from Krasimir Balakov, putting the ball past 
hard-charging goalkeeper Luis Islas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have time to think about it," Stoichkov said. "Just kick it in." 
</P>
<P>
 The second goal was much a surprise to the Bulgarians as to anyone watching. 
Sirakov leaped high in front of the net and headed in a corner kick. 
</P>
<P>
 But by then, it hardly mattered. Argentina was losing -- a loss that might 
help it reach the World Cup championship.

DODGERS DENY THE PHILLIES; BASEBALL: THREE-RUN DOUBLE BY DESHIELDS IN NINTH 
INNING GIVES LOS ANGELES A 4-3 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Delino DeShields' most glorious moment as a Dodger came Thursday night at 
Dodger Stadium when, with his team trailing in the ninth inning, 3-1, he 
doubled into the gap in left-center field for a 4-3 victory over the 
Philadelphia Phillies.  
</P>
<P>
 As he pulled into second base, the celebration had begun at home plate, and he 
stood and raised his arms. For the usually reserved DeShields, this was a huge 
emotional display. "Every now and then a little basketball comes out of me," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Third base coach Joey Amalfitano was the first to reach him, and then the rest 
of his Dodger teammates followed. At one point, they tried to hoist him, to 
display him to a crowd of 31,295, which stood in applause. For the Dodgers, it 
was their 20th comeback victory of the season. But for DeShields, it was his 
first big hit, his first major contribution since being traded to the Dodgers 
before the season started. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the guy," Manager Tom Lasorda said. "Since he has come back (off the 
disabled list), he is the Delino of the Montreal Expos." 
</P>
<P>
 Since returning on June 20, DeShields is batting .368 and has a nine-game 
hitting streak. He had struggled Thursday night, though, striking out in the 
seventh inning with runners on second and third and the Dodgers trailing, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 His ninth-inning double against Phillie closer Doug Jones came with one out 
and the bases loaded. It gave the Dodgers their fifth victory in six games. And 
for DeShields, who has endured a season of disappointing injuries, nothing 
could have been sweeter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been waiting to get a big hit like that," he said. "You feel good with 
any kind of hit, but I was fortunate to get a second chance. . . . It's getting 
close (to playing the way I used to). I don't want to blow my own horn. I just 
want to go out and do something every day." 
</P>
<P>
 After being held to three hits through eight innings, the Dodgers got three 
consecutive singles against Jones. With one out, pinch-hitter Jeff Treadway 
singled to right and pinch-hitter Dave Hansen grounded a singled to center 
before Brett Butler grounded deep behind first base. Second baseman Mickey 
Morandini got to the ball, but no one was covering first base. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones (2-2), who had converted 20 of 21 save opportunities, had a 1-and-2 
count on DeShields when he threw him a fastball. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good pitch, but sometimes it happens that way," DeShields said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the night the Dodgers honored their former ace, Fernando Valenzuela, it 
seemed appropriate that the game to follow would turn into a pitcher's duel. 
Against starter Bobby Munoz, the Dodgers' only run before the ninth came in the 
second inning, when Raul Mondesi hit an 0-1 pitch into the right-field bullpen 
for his 13th home run. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger starter Pedro Astacio issued only one walk during his seven innings, 
but it came back to hurt him. In the fourth inning, Astacio walked John Kruk 
before Jim Eisenreich homered to right, giving the Phillies a 2-1 lead. Astacio 
pitched well, giving up only five hits and two earned runs. 
</P>
<P>
 He left after seven innings with the Phillies leading, 2-1, giving way to 
three relievers. Rudy Seanez, brought in to pitch the ninth, helped the 
Phillies score their final run with a wild pitch that put Billy Hatcher on 
third. Kevin Stocker laid down a bunt that Seanez had no chance on. He stumbled 
while trying to field it, and Hatcher scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Munoz, who came to the Phillies as part of a trade for Terry Mulholland, held 
the Dodgers to three hits in seven innings but gave the Dodgers some scoring 
opportunities, walking the bases loaded in the fourth inning and putting two 
more on with walks in the seventh, but the Dodgers didn't capitalize.

TENTH TITLE IN SIGHT FOR NAVRATILOVA; WIMBLEDON: AMERICAN DEFEATS FERNANDEZ,

<P>
 The 22nd and final edition of "Martina Woos Wimbledon" is alive and well, but 
it needed some serious help during Thursday's women's semifinals. More help 
than anyone ever imagined -- except Navratilova, who later said she knew her 
match against fellow American Gigi Fernandez would be harder than a week-old 
scone. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure she did. 
</P>
<P>
 The unseeded Fernandez limped onto Centre Court with a pulled left hamstring, 
a No. 99 ranking, the lowest of any female Grand Slam semifinalist since the 
open era began in 1968; an 0-7 record against her Aspen buddy Navratilova, and 
a singles record that had her thinking retirement. Fernandez hadn't won a 
singles title of note since wood rackets were the rage. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened? Fernandez delivered "the best performance of my life" and 
flirted with pulling off the biggest upset of her career. In the end, she had 
to settle for a 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) loss to the Grandma Moses of tennis. But for a 
moment there. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I have to say I'm just proud of the way that I handled it, and I'm happy that 
I was able to produce my best tennis at Centre Court . . . Wimbledon . . . 
against Martina Navratilova, the legend," Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The legend now faces third-seeded Conchita Martinez of Spain, who defeated 
unseeded Lori McNeil, 3-6, 6-2, 10-8. The final Saturday will be Navratilova's 
12th at Wimbledon, Martinez's first. In fact, it will be the first time 
Martinez has reached a Grand Slam final in seven years on the WTA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The 37-year-old Navratilova, who is retiring from singles play at season's 
end, has won nine Wimbledon championships and considers a 10th title to be the 
fairy-tale way to close her career. She even let herself think about the 
possibilities during the second set of her match against Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought about it once -- during a serve," Navratilova said. "And I missed 
the serve, of course." 
</P>
<P>
 Jarred back to reality, Navratilova went back to work. Good thing, too, since 
a relaxed and confident Fernandez was causing the pro-Martina crowd to reassess 
its allegiances. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez, her left thigh heavily taped, couldn't move very well. Her serve 
was so-so. She occasionally forgot she was playing singles, not doubles, her 
specialty. But after an embarrassing start -- she actually received the 
Wimbledon version of a Bronx cheer after scoring her first point three games 
into the match -- Fernandez began to challenge Navratilova. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just tried to pretend that we were practicing at the Aspen Club and not 
think we were at Centre Court," Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova, the oldest player in this year's women's draw, won the first set, 
then found herself down, 2-1, then 4-2, then 5-2, then set point before she 
realized that even fairy tales need help sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
 She started hitting winners when they counted most. Big point? Navratilova hit 
a big shot. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fernandez had her moments too. Once, after returning a shot off the frame 
and sending it weakly back into Navratilova's wheelhouse, Fernandez rushed the 
net, racket in front of her face, hoping for a miracle return. It didn't 
happen. Navratilova bounced it into Row M and then looked down at Fernandez, 
who had fallen on her behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go away!" Navratilova said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going away," Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 And she didn't. At least, not right away. 
</P>
<P>
 The second set went to a tiebreaker and again Fernandez served for the set and 
a chance to send the match into a third set, where anything is possible. But 
Navratilova hit a backhand winner on Fernandez's serve and later won the match 
with another backhand that Fernandez thought would fall long but didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was right there," Fernandez said. "Bad judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 After a handshake at the net, Navratilova searched out her coach and friends 
in the audience and raised her forefinger. 
</P>
<P>
 "One more final," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she buried her head in her lap. Fernandez came over, put her arm around 
Navratilova and happily said, "I'm rooting for you to win the 10th." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, someone asked Navratilova if she had won because she was luckier or 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really care," Navratilova said, ending the deep analysis line of 
questioning. "I'm in the finals." 
</P>
<P>
 That she is. When the tournament began, that seemed like something of a 
longshot. Her game was as solid as butterscotch pudding and she had top-seeded 
Steffi Graf to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Graf lost, as did most of the other top women. Navratilova's game got 
better and suddenly the turbocharger kicked in on the farewell tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, what a way to go," she said. "Geez, this is what I dreamed about. Win 
or lose -- obviously I'm going to be busting my gut out there to win -- but 
this is what I wanted, to go out in style. And either way, I'm going out in 
style." 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting for her is Martinez, 22, the first Spaniard to reach the Wimbledon 
final since Lili de Alvarez in 1928. Martinez had better hope for a better 
result. De Alvarez lost to Helen Wills in straight sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't worry me at all," Martinez said of her Saturday match against 
Navratilova. "I'm going to try my best." 
</P>
<P>
 What the Martinez-McNeil match lacked in marquee value, it made up in 
dramatics. The third set was especially taut, with the American going up, 8-7, 
before Martinez evened the score by holding serve. 
</P>
<P>
 That done, Martinez broke McNeil's serve and then won the match a game later 
on a seeing-eye backhand cross-court shot. 
</P>
<P>
 McNeil, who upset Graf in the opening round, was trying to become only the 
third African-American finalist in Wimbledon history. Instead, she'll have to 
settle for almosts and what-ifs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed always after (a loss)," she said. "I'm disappointed and I 
thought I was pretty close and yet not quite there." Wimbledon Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Today's men's semifinal lineup: Top-seeded and defending champion Pete Sampras 
vs. No. 6 Todd Martin and No. 7 Boris Becker vs. No. 4 Goran Ivanisevic. 
Sampras leads Martin, 3-1, in head-to-head meetings, but Martin recently beat 
Sampras in the final at Queen's Club. Becker leads Ivanisevic, 6-3. Neither 
Martin nor Ivanisevic has won a Grand Slam event title. Sampras has won four, 
and Becker, a three-time Wimbledon champion, five. . . . Conchita Martinez 
leads Martina Navratilova in their series, 3-1. All her victories, however, 
were scored on clay.

WITH ASSIST FROM MIKHAILOVSKY, BLADES HANG ON AGAINST CALGARY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Goaltender Max Mikhailovsky stopped eight shots in the final five minutes, 
three in the last 30 seconds, to help the Blades hold off the Calgary Rad'z, 
7-6, in a Roller Hockey International game Thursday night at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blades' Steve Bogoyevac scored a power-play goal on a length-of-the-court 
breakaway with 5:21 to play, providing the final margin.Bogoyevac assisted on 
four other Blade goals. 
</P>
<P>
 With four Blade regulars out of the lineup, the Rad'z kept possession for 
nearly all of the final five minutes, but Mikhailovsky and the Blade defense 
held. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory in front of 4,015 put the Blades (5-3) in second place in the 
Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
 After a sloppy first half, Steve Wilson scored the only goal of the third 
quarter on a power-play transition shot from the left side, giving the Blades a 
6-4 lead at 10:48. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Ross and Craig Charron suffered game-ending injuries in the third 
quarter, leaving the Blades with only two lines and two substitutes for most of 
the second half. MATT WHITE

MORNING BRIEFING: DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THEIR HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ninety years after serving as the site of the 1904 World's Fair and Olympics 
-- the first Games held in the Western Hemisphere -- Washington University in 
St. Louis is playing a key role in another major event. 
</P>
<P>
 It is housing most of the 3,000 competitors in the U.S. Olympic Festival, 
which starts today. But the historical significance seems lost on some, 
including a couple of female soccer players. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's news to me," said Beth Uydess of Westport, Conn. "I'm not historically 
literate, unless it's concerning my sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Tammy Pearman, of Fairfax, Va., said, "I was figuring in the back of my mind 
that the school was in Washington state. I would honestly say that most people 
are quite oblivious." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Washington U.: In 1904, the World's Fair was a lot more important than the 
Olympics. The Games were conducted informally with 12 countries playing second 
fiddle to athletic clubs from the United States. The New York A.C. was first in 
overall medals, followed by Chicago, New York and Milwaukee, with Germany a 
distant fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympics also lacked women and there were no tryouts, with many vendors 
from the St. Louis World's Fair taking part in events that included tug-of-war. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who were the first MVPs in the major leagues? 
</P>
<P>
 Regional Rockets: The cover Sports Illustrated wouldn't print for the rest of 
the nation -- and almost didn't print at all -- was a sellout in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 The special cover of NBA MVP Hakeem Olajuwon and the champion Houston Rockets 
was only available in Houston and only on 300,000 copies. The rest featured 
World Cup soccer out front. 
</P>
<P>
 SI had planned to publish a special edition only if the New York Knicks won 
the championship. But the New York-based magazine reversed the decision after 
outraged Houstonians swamped their switchboards with complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking too much: John Starks says he has finally figured out his poor 
showing for the Knicks in the seventh game of the NBA finals, in which he made 
only two of 18 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had too much time to think about the game," Starks said. "I was 
over-prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 Role models: Lori McNeil was asked if upsets by her and Bryan Shelton in the 
first round of Wimbledon would inspire other African Americans to play tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope it inspired Americans, period," said McNeil, who ousted 
top-ranked Steffi Graf. "I think we're pretty good sports on the court. I think 
we could be a great role model for American youngsters of all races." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Hack Wilson, Chicago Cub outfielder, and Joe Cronin, Washington 
Senator shortstop, in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Bruce Coslet, former New York Jet coach, on free agency in the NFL: 
"It's like recruiting for college, only the money's on the table instead of 
under it." SHAV GLICK

GOLF ROUNDUP; ALBUS, HOBDAY SHOOT 66S IN IDEAL FIRST ROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Albus and Simon Hobday took advantage of ideal morning conditions to fire 
five-under-par 66s Thursday and share the first-round lead in the U.S. Senior 
Open at Pinehurst, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was playing pretty soft," Albus said of the famed No. 2 course at the 
Pinehurst Resort and Country Club made vulnerable by overnight rains. "To tell 
you the truth, I'm a little surprised the scores aren't even lower." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd hate to think what it would be like if it was hard and fast and the wind 
was blowing," Hobday said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Carey and Graham Marsh, a rookie on the 50-and-over circuit, shared 
third with 68s. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Nicklaus, Lee Trevino and Ray Floyd were among several at 69. Others were 
Tom Wargo, Isao Aoki, Tom Shaw and club pro Jack Kiefer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Murphy, last year's Nike Tour player of the year who had failed to make 
the cut 12 times this season, got his putter working and finally found a course 
to his liking at the Western Open in Lemont, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, whose highest finish in the three tournaments he completed was 44th, 
shot a six-under-par 66 and was part of a five-way tie for the first-round 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 John Huston, Bill Glasson, Phil Mickelson and Bob Gilder were also at 66. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion Nick Price, Dave Rummells, Andy Bean, Scott Hoch, Greg 
Kraft, Steve Lamontagne and Mark Calcavecchia were all one shot back. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Torrance matched the course record with a seven-under-par 65 in the 
opening round and took a two-shot lead in the Irish Open at Kilkenny, Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Seve Ballesteros and Englishman Craig Cassels were tied for second.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: IT'S AS AMERICAN AS A ROUND OF 16 WORLD CUP GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fourth of July usually means fireworks, barbecues, picnics in the park, 
mom, apple pie and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, you can add soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest game in the U.S. soccer history -- the United States vs. Brazil in 
the second round of the World Cup -- will be played Monday at 12:30 p.m., with 
ABC televising it. 
</P>
<P>
 About 22 million people watched the United States' 1-0 loss to Romania on ABC 
last Sunday. The national rating, which came out Thursday, was a 6.8 -- the 
best for soccer in this country. The previous high was a 6.6 for the 1982 World 
Cup final between West Germany and Italy, which also was televised by ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's announcing team for Monday's game will be play-by-play man Roger 
Twibell, former U.S. national team captain Rick Davis and Seamus Malin, 
generally considered America's best soccer commentator. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, being the best soccer commentator in the United States is sort of 
like being the best mountain climber in the Sahara. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because there is no great demand for soccer commentators in this country, 
there are none who do it full time. 
</P>
<P>
 In his main job, Malin is an administrator at Harvard. He has held various 
positions at the school, from which he graduated in 1962, and directs the 
international office. He was the director of the financial-aid office from 1969 
to '77. 
</P>
<P>
 Malin is a native of Ireland who came to this country at 18 because his 
father, a political writer, got a job with the Boston Globe. He loves soccer, 
played it at Harvard, coached it at various levels and follows it closely. At 
54, he still plays in an adult recreational league in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Malin, a pleasant chap, is particularly good at explaining, in a concise 
manner, the nuances of the game to basically clueless American viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Malin and other U.S. soccer announcers working the World Cup have drawn 
complaints from hard-core soccer fans. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them is Robert Lusetich, the West Coast correspondent for the 
Australian, the country's national daily, who has covered soccer extensively 
and wrote a biography of Frank Arok, Australia's version of U.S. Coach Bora 
Milutinovic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commentary has been barely acceptable," Lusetich said. "Much of this is 
due to the fact that these are by and large not professional sportscasters but 
rather fans of the game who are trying their hand at commentating. 
</P>
<P>
 "The play-by-play has been virtually nonexistent, and while the color stuff 
has been good with the rudimentary explanations, it is well below par to the 
experienced viewer. 
</P>
<P>
 "(ESPN's) Bob Ley and Randy Hahn have been notable exceptions, while Seamus 
Malin has tried but lacks excitement." 
</P>
<P>
 Lusetich, who lives in Los Angeles, offers one suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not fair to compare this crew to the likes of England's Martin Tyler, 
who is akin to John Madden in the way he's revered as a commentator," he said. 
"But I for one would love to hear Tyler call one game on U.S. television and 
see how America responds." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One noticeable difference between soccer and American football is the start. 
Soccer seems to need a kickoff or tipoff or something dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Sunday, ABC commentator Peter Vermes, a former player whose lack of 
broadcasting experience showed, was in the middle of nervously setting up the 
U.S.-Romania game when the cameras suddenly showed that play had begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Lusetich makes a good point when he says, "Much of the emotional ambience of 
international soccer is missing, and I think a lot of it has to do with 
excluding the national anthems from the coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "A close-up of the players' faces as they line up builds excitement like 
nothing else and is visually compelling." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the technical aspects of the coverage, Lusetich said, "The actual feed 
(supplied by the European Broadcasting Union, or EBU) has been disappointing 
because it's the typical boring European way of covering soccer with wide shots 
that make the players look like tiny dots. There need to be more close-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 "When (Australian) David Hill (the new president of Fox sports) revolutionized 
soccer coverage with Sky Sports in England, he did so by using 18 cameras 
rather than the normal 10, even putting tiny cameras in the corner of the nets 
and inter-cutting different angles constantly. It was enormously successful." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Loren Phillips of Arleta, a soccer fan ever since a history teacher at Van 
Nuys High turned him on to the 1970 World Cup, has a different complaint about 
the commentary. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, 42, and his nephew, Rick Boggs, 31, who are both blind, say it is 
impossible for them to follow the action as described by the play-by-play 
television announcers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is needed is an announcer like Chick Hearn, who always tells you what is 
going on," Phillips said. "The World Cup TV announcers don't tell you a thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, when Hearn calls a Laker game, he is calling it for both radio and 
television. What Phillips is seeking is a radio call of World Cup games. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, who has his own radio production company, has started a one-man 
campaign to get an L.A. radio station to carry the games, beginning with the 
second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips said a Chicago-based radio network, One on One, is carrying the World 
Cup, and that broadcasts are being carried in every major market in the country 
except Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips said KIEV, a brokerage station that sells air time, has agreed to 
carry the games if he can raise about $60,000 from sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 To listen to the Netherlands-Belgium game on June 25 and last Sunday's 
U.S.-Romania game, Phillips and Boggs called a Chicago station and asked to be 
put on hold so they could hear the play-by-play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the only way we could follow those matches," Phillips said, adding he 
wasn't too eager to see his phone bill.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; NIGERIANS PREFER ITALY TO ROSE BOWL; GROUP 
D: THEY SCORE IN EXTRA TIME TO BEAT GREECE, 2-0, WIN DIVISION AND AVOID A 
CROSS-COUNTRY FLIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What some people won't do to avoid visiting Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 To the recently growing list of canceled vacations and relocated conventions, 
add this: 
</P>
<P>
 A lunging, last-minute, 23-yard goal between three defenders by a player whose 
team had essentially already won. 
</P>
<P>
 Sad, but true. Just listen to Nigerian Coach Clemens Westerhof, whose team 
defeated Greece, 2-0, in the final first-round World Cup match Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 88th minute, with Nigeria leading, 1-0, and stalling away the final 
moments, a sideline policeman informed Westerhof that in the other Group D 
game, Bulgaria had just upset Argentina, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 If that score remained the same, a stunned Westerhof realized his team would 
be third-place team and go to Pasadena for a second-round game with Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if the team could score one more goal in the remaining couple of 
minutes, it could win Group D, remain at Foxboro Stadium and face Italy in the 
second round. 
</P>
<P>
 So what if Italy is considered a tougher team than Romania? That was nothing 
compared to the dreaded prospects of stepping off a plane at LAX. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard the Bulgaria score, I called Daniel Amokachi over to the bench, and I 
gave him instructions," Westerhof said. 
</P>
<P>
 And simple instructions they were. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, 'Stand in front of the goal and, for God's sake, score! Score, or 
we are going to Los Angeles!' " Westerhof related. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unknown whether it was Westerhof's frantic tone of voice or the words, 
"Los Angeles" that convinced Amokachi to listen. 
</P>
<P>
 But after cruising through the game with only two shots, this prolific scorer 
quickly found another gear. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth minute of extra time, exactly one minute before the referee 
would end the game, Amokachi took a pass from Mile Emenalo. He dribbled 10 
yards across the field while avoiding three sliding tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he sent a shot into the upper left-hand corner past bewildered Christos 
Karkamanis, the third Greek goalkeeper in as many games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just did it to make my coach happy," Amokachi said, shrugging. "He tell me 
I got to score, I got to score." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, it appeared to be no more than a game-cinching goal. But after 
dancing into each other's arms and circling the field before 53,001, the 
Nigerians explained its importance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not want to go to Los Angeles, no way," midfielder Sunday Oliseh said. 
"What is that, about a seven-hour flight? It took us 13 hours just to get to 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 "No Los Angeles for us. We don't care who we play, we don't want to go right 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 So they will take a tougher road Tuesday against an Italian club that 
traditionally turns up the heat after the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, they say they will have their minds on the game, unlike Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 When Westerhof walked into the locker room for a pregame pep talk, he said he 
found a team that was talking more about the suspension of Argentine star Diego 
Maradona than Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to cause some tension in there," Westhof said, smiling. "So I did." 
</P>
<P>
 The pep talk became a pep scolding. And even then, his talented team didn't 
score until the the second extra minute at the end of the first half. The goal 
came on a chip shot by Finidi George after a brilliant run by Emmanuel Amunike. 
</P>
<P>
 "We score in extra time in the first half, and extra time in the second half, 
that tells me that maybe we aren't ready," Westerhof said. "This team should 
know that nobody underestimates us anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The Greeks cannot say the same. They fly back to Athens as the worst of eight 
teams that did not survive the first round, outscored 10-0, the only team that 
did not score despite taking 34 shots in three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of those shots came during a furious six-minute stretch late in the 
game, when they obviously were trying to go home with at least one souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nigerian goalkeeper Peter Rufai made a diving save on a close chip by 
Panagiotis Tsalouhidis. Then Tsalouhidis was wide left on a header. 
</P>
<P>
 Vassilis Dimitriadis was then barely beaten to a loose ball by Rufai, causing 
the largely Greek crowd to groan for the final time while Dimitriadis shook his 
fist in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least today, people see that we are trying," defender Minas Handzitis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nigerians are trying too, at least when they deem it necessary. And if 
they want to reach their stated goal, they had better deem it necessary pretty 
quick. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we can make the final four," Westerhof said. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not aim for the final two? Well, you know where that game is being played.

 "How could we explain to the children, to the future generation, that this was 
the finest and also one of the most corrupt footballers of his or any other 
lifetime? Maradona was simply the best, and the worst, performer of his time. 
Beauty laced with poison, genius flawed by greed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was not, I am quite sure, taking ephedrine to cure any cold or asthma. He 
was taking it to cheat. But even that is a simplistic observation, for no drug 
could give Maradona the skill, the balance, the imagination that are beyond 
almost all others. What he was attempting to do was to use the stimulant -- one 
which accelerates the heartbeat and improves the flow of blood to muscles -- to 
persuade his ailing body to give him one last month, one last hurrah."

 "The final indignity this week in a checkered career is enough to make you 
weep. Maradona has been destroyed as much by villainous treatment on the field 
over 15 years, and by media hounding, as by his own weaknesses.It is wretched 
how the public is too unforgiving and sanctimonious toward fallen sporting 
heroes, when we accept without challenge the idiosyncrasies and psychological 
failures of the tortured genius in art, science, music or literature, such as 
Gauguin, Mendel, Elgar or Ibsen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who now leap to condemn him, especially from within the game, should 
pause to consider their degree of blame for a maze of problems that have 
enmeshed him over the years. Like (Northern Ireland's George) Best before him, 
he was a boy from humble surroundings overwhelmed by money and fame, which he 
had not the education to handle, and was kicked a thousand times a season by 
cynical defenders under the eye of indifferent administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Maradona is a victim of self-indulgence, he is also the victim of foul 
play, inefficient refereeing and disciplinary incompetence. FIFA, the sport's 
world governing body, which now expels him from the World Cup, has much to 
answer for."

 "OK, here's one. 'Edina, Minnesota. Dear Alexi: Hi, my name is Kelly and I 
have one sister and one dog named Hershey. What is your favorite kind of girl?' 
Ha! I usually like them alive! What else does she say here, let's see: 'My 
sister wrote to Cobi (Jones) but I think you're cooler.' OK! Where's Cobi? Show 
him this. This one definitely gets a reply from me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoa, here's one from Michigan, my state. Should've opened this one first. 
'From Kevin Coburn. I hear you like Slurpees. You should try Philadelphia. 
Philadelphia has a 7-Eleven on every street almost.' Look here, Kevin even 
included a pen. Kevin is taking no chances. Kevin's giving me the scoop on 
Philadelphia 7-Elevens. He definitely gets a reply, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's a really good letter, I'll write back. Sometimes I'll even call. I 
called some kid in South Dakota or someplace the other day. He says, 'Who is 
this?' He thinks it's one of his friends playing a joke. I love it. 'Come on. 
Who is this?' 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, one more. This one's from, let's see, Kati. 'Dear Alexi, hmmm, blah, 
blah, blah.' OK, here we go. 'I know as well as the stars that this letter will 
not take flight into your hands.' Hmmm. Interesting. That's the thing about 
writing letters. It takes imagination. It takes ingenuity. And in this case, I 
think maybe it took a little tequila." MIKE DOWNEY

 Brazil Coach Parreira's appointment with the media Thursday at the team's 
headquarters in Los Gatos was advertised as a news conference, but it was more 
like a firing squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be dynamite," Pedro Bial, a correspondent for Brazilian TV 
network O Globo, told U.S. colleagues while waiting for Parreira to appear in a 
tent raised on the grounds of the Villa Felice resort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any other country that qualified in first place in its group with no losses 
would be happy," Bial said. "But to Brazil, the 1-1 draw with Sweden was like a 
tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the few minutes he spent with them outside the dressing room 
immediately after that game Tuesday, Parreira had not been available to 
reporters since. So the more than 100 Brazilian reporters in Los Gatos were 
impatient to fire their questions at him. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the language of the press conference was Portuguese, it was obvious 
even to those who do not speak it that most of Parreira's answers began with, 
"That's your opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 The team's liaison to the organizing committee, Francisco Marcos, later said, 
"The Brazilian reporters start with a question, but it quickly becomes advice." 
</P>
<P>
 In a subsequent news conference with English-speaking reporters, Parreira 
said, "Brazilian public opinion is more critical than anywhere else in the 
world. No team was able to advance to the second round as peacefully as Brazil, 
but, still, people complain. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were 30% as good as the fans and the media expect us to be, we would be 
unbeatable." RANDY HARVEY

 Perhaps because the Brazilian media were still dissecting the 1-1 tie with 
Sweden, they asked Brazil's coach, Parreira, a couple of questions about his 
team's second-round foe, the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are much improved, technically," he said in response to one. "They 
defend well and counterattack with danger." 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the other, about U.S. players he regards highly, he said, "The 
goalkeeper (Tony Meola), (Marcelo) Balboa and the guy (Stewart) in front."

<P>
 After losing to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, 1-0, the atmosphere in Belgium is 
one of astonishment, sadness and discouragement, and there has been sharp 
criticism of the team's poor performance. 
</P>
<P>
 More than an hour before the game began at 6:30 p.m. Brussels time, streets 
were deserted.Shops closed early and offices were empty. All were expecting an 
easy game. Overconfidence was blamed when the team lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The national Belgian daily Le Soir had this headline: "Days of grace ending 
already for the Devils; beaten by Saudi Arabia, they have spoiled the feast."  
</P>
<P>
 The daily La Libre Belgique read: "The Red Devils fall back on earth." 
</P>
<P>
 For Jean-Francois Jourdain of Le Soir, "as soon as they do not have to fight 
for their life, the Red Devils are capable of losing against 11 old ladies, 
each playing with a cup of tea in their hand." 
</P>
<P>
 For Benoit De Smedt in La Libre Belgique, "There is obviously great distress 
and grief in the Belgian team after the match." He underlines Coach Paul Van 
Himst's taking 45 minutes to get out of the changing room, and quotes him as 
saying, "I cannot have a grudge against my players. Some of them were literally 
dead at the final whistle." 
</P>
<P>
 In Le Soir, Jacques Hereng detailed the failures of each player, calling it a 
"collective wreck, an appalling performance . . . of a team that did not have a 
soul anymore."

BODY SHOTS KEEP MOSLEY UNBEATEN 
</P>

 The expectations are so high for Pomona lightweight (Sugar) Shane Mosley that 
even dominating performances are becoming unacceptable for some people. Mosley 
won every round before stopping Las Vegas' Johnny Bryant at 53 seconds of the 
eighth round Thursday night at the Irvine Marriott before 1,172 restless 
spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant (9-8-1) was a difficult target because he covered his head throughout 
the fight. But Mosley's devastating body attack began to take a toll in the 
fifth round. The ringside doctor, James Jen-Kin, checked on Bryant at the end 
of the seventh round, then stopped it when Bryant went down from a digging left 
uppercut. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hit me with a good body shot," Bryant said. "It was adding up. It didn't 
make sense standing there taking any more of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mosley: "When I started on the top, it wasn't doing the damage, so I 
said, 'Let me try going down low.' When I started hitting him, I could tell it 
was starting to get to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Bryant was grimacing badly as he talked about Mosley's potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's good," Bryant said. "He's just a lot better fighter. He throws some 
sharp punches. He'll do all right." 
</P>
<P>
 But the crowd wasn't nearly as impressed. Some of them began leaving before 
the fight ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley, who raised his record to 12-0 with 11 knockouts, wasn't thrilled with 
his performance, but he wasn't disappointed either. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I did pretty good," said Mosley, the ninth-rated lightweight in the 
world by Ring Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley said he would have been sharper had he not had to lose four pounds 
three days before the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were going to fight at 138, then they told me to get to 134," 
said Mosley, who, like Bryant, eventually weighed in at 135. 
</P>
<P>
 The featured undercard bout between middleweights Randy Smith of Azusa and 
Seattle's Waleeb Underwood turned into a dance contest amid a chorus of boos. 
Smith (11-1), who tried to press the action, easily won a unanimous decision 
over the listless Underwood (9-8). 
</P>
<P>
 In a lightweight bout, Anaheim's Joey Martin (12-4) was stopped in the fifth 
round by a straight left jab from Mark Reels (9-3) of Patterson, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Bantamweights Jose Gallegos of Acapulco, Mexico, and Johnny Vasquez of 
Huntington Beach fought for the second time in two months with Gallegos winning 
his second consecutive majority decision. In the first round, referee Larry 
Rozadilla threw Vasquez into the ropes as he was attempting to get Vasquez off 
the fallen Gallegos. Gallegos recovered to win the next three rounds and take 
the decision.

ON THE BEACH / JODY BERGER; KIDNEY INJURY TO KEEP KIRALY OUT OF MANHATTAN BEACH 
OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A dominant volleyball force on any beach, Karch Kiraly has always seemed 
especially tough in the Manhattan Beach Open, a $100,000 tournament that begins 
today. He won for the first time 14 years ago and, after skipping years to play 
in the Olympics, he came back in the late '80s and preceded to win in each of 
the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, 30 years after Mike O'Hara and Mike Bright recorded their fifth 
consecutive victory on the sand, Kiraly was favored to match their record and 
eclipse one of his own. Another victory at Manhattan Beach would make Kiraly 
the only player in 34 years to win seven times there. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of competing on the beach, Kiraly will be home recuperating from a 
kidney injury. 
</P>
<P>
 While playing in the June 9 Gold Crown in Boulder, Colo., the 6-foot-2 Kiraly 
crashed into a courtside banner and landed on his backside, injuring his right 
kidney. He continued playing and won the tournament with his partner of three 
years, Kent Steffes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never in pain," Kiraly said. "I went to dinner that night with some 
friends and when I went to the bathroom I saw some colors coming out of me that 
shouldn't be." 
</P>
<P>
 Kiraly reported the blood in his urine to his physician and arranged an 
appointment when he returned home that Monday. His doctor diagnosed a contusion 
to the right kidney and ordered a CAT scan. The test revealed a healthy kidney 
with no loss of function, but his doctor prescribed bed rest until the bruise 
healed. 
</P>
<P>
 For two weeks, Kiraly stayed in bed watching videos and working on his laptop 
computer. It was the first time he had missed beach competition because of an 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started some light walking on Monday, which was 48 hours after my blood 
cleared," Kiraly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiraly won't attend the Open even as a spectator because his doctor advised 
him to stay out of cars. A sudden stop or another jarring motion could 
re-injure the kidney. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be too much torture to watch. It would be much more fun to 
play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Kiraly thought he'd be ready to play this weekend but the recovery 
has been slower than expected. Because the Assn. of Volleyball Professionals' 
tour goes to Puerto Rico the following weekend and then skips a weekend, Kiraly 
is considering waiting until the July 22 Chicago Open to rejoin the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next event is in Puerto Rico and I'm a possible for that," Kiraly said, 
"but I'm inclined to take the most conservative route and wait until Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
 Steffes, who has not played since Kiraly was injured, will play in Manhattan. 
He will team with Scott Ayakatubby, who won the Baltimore Open last weekend in 
his first tournament since taking 10 weeks off to recuperate from a groin 
injury. Steffes and Ayakatubby are seeded No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayakatubby's Baltimore Open partner, Eric Fonoimoana, makes up the 
eighth-seeded team with Tim Hovland. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Add volleyball: Sinjin Smith, who has 135 AVP victories, will compete today 
for the first time since knee surgeries sidelined him at the beginning of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not really sure how I injured it. I just know I had problems with my knee 
two years previous and no one could tell me what it was," Smith said. "At the 
end of the season last year, I felt like I was at the end of my career." 
</P>
<P>
 In November, an MRI diagnostic test showed a tear in the quadriceps. Smith 
underwent surgery the next day to reattach a portion of the tendon to the bone. 
</P>
<P>
 After 12 days of inactivity, Smith started slowly working the muscle again. In 
December, he was riding his bike and took a spill, which prompted a second 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, Smith slowly worked to rehabilitate the muscle. His decision to play in 
the Manhattan Beach Open came at the last minute. Teams had to register with 
the AVP by 3 p.m. Tuesday. That afternoon, Smith was on the beach testing his 
jumps and dives to determine if the knee was strong enough to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt surprisingly good," Smith said. "I believe, and the doctor believes, I 
could recover fully or be even better than I was before the surgeries. The 
frustrating thing is it's taken so long to recover the muscle." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the last-minute decision, Smith registered with Brian Ivey although 
he hadn't been able to reach him. The next day he found out Ivey was injured 
and couldn't play. Smith changed to team with Mark Eller and received a $50 
fine from the AVP. 
</P>
<P>
 Eller, a 16-year tour veteran, has won five Open events, one with Smith in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith plans to play with Bruk Vandeweghe in the Goodwill Games in St. 
Petersburg, Russia, July 23-24, and may face a second fine because the Goodwill 
Games are not an AVP-sanctioned event. 
</P>
<P>
 The AVP has not been able to reach an agreement with the international 
volleyball organization because of sponsorship clashes (the AVP is Miller 
Lite-sponsored and the Games are sponsored by Bud Light) and conflicting dates. 
The Chicago Open is being held the same weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm gearing up for the Goodwill Games," Smith said. "I feel it's important to 
support the growth of the sport worldwide and in the Olympics." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Op Pro surfing: Contest organizers for the Op Pro, which begins July 26 in 
Huntington Beach, have issued a wild-card invitation to three-time world 
champion Tom Curren. 
</P>
<P>
 A Santa Barbara native, Curren was sponsored by the surfwear company in the 
mid-'80s and was a mainstay in the competition. He finished fifth in the first 
Op Pro in 1982, came back to win the next two and then won again in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Although anyone can enter the Op Pro, the wild-card invite assures Curren a 
higher seeding than he would regularly receive because he has not competed 
regularly in the last couple years. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the U.S. Open of Surfing, the fourth stop on the world championship 
tour, begins two days after the Op Pro also at Huntington Beach, many of the 
world's top surfers will compete in the Op Pro. 
</P>
<P>
 A four-star stop on the world qualifying tour, the Op Pro offers surfers 
points toward next year's world championship tour and a few shots at the U.S. 
Open. The top three finishers in the Op Pro who are unseeded in the U.S. Open 
will be asked to compete in that event, which is invitation-only. 
</P>
<P>
 But Curren might surf in the U.S. Open even without topping the Op Pro. The 
Assn. of Surfing Professionals, which sanctions the world tour and the 
qualifying tour, holds out one wild-card entry. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, ASP officials planned a surf-off between Curren and the 1985 and 
'86 OP Pro winner Mark Occhilupo, but Occhilupo declined. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The first World Skimboard Championships will be held along with the annual 
Victoria Pro/Am Skim Contest, July 16-17 at Aliso Beach Park, South Laguna. The 
deadline to enter is July 9. For more information, call (714) 494-5485.. . . 
The Malibu Pro, a two-star event on the Bud Surf Tour, begins July 10, the same 
day as the Reunion Pro on the world tour. Without world tour surfers, Pat 
O'Connell of Laguna Niguel, Jeff Deffenbaugh of Huntington Beach and other 
local surfers are sure to be favored in Malibu. Local longboarders to watch 
include Ted Robinson of Manhattan Beach and Newport Beach's Richie Collins, who 
will compete in the surfing and longboarding divisions.

 Pena, 35, complained Tuesday in Chicago of elbow pain and returned to 
Pittsburgh to be examined by team orthopedist Jack Failla. General Manager Cam 
Bonifay released Pena after learning he might not return for weeks, if at all 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The right-handed reliever, who missed the 1993 season after requiring the 
surgery, cost the Pirates $1.475 million over two years for only 22 
appearances, all of them this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if he could make it back. It would be at least five weeks before 
he would be ready for rehabilitation, and maybe a lot longer," Bonifay said. 
"It was a tough decision but it was the right decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Activated May 1, Pena (3-2, 5.02 earned-run average) had seven saves in eight 
opportunities and was looking to become the Pirates' best closer since Jim Gott 
had a club-record 36 saves in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sad part is he was doing a hell of a job," Pirate Manager Jim Leyland 
said. "But you can't say it was unexpected, because we've been holding our 
breath since day one. It's been a crap shoot all the way along with him. But 
it's definitely a tough blow to lose your closer."

 San Francisco Giant center fielder Darren Lewis committed the first error of 
his career Thursday night, ending a major league record 392-game streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis was given an error in the third inning when a base hit by Montreal's 
Cliff Floyd skipped under his glove as he charged the ball in shallow center. 
The error allowed Floyd to reach second. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the error, Lewis had handled 938 chances without a mistake. His streak 
was the longest ever without an error in the majors and the longest to start a 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' last error came on May 10, 1991, at triple-A Phoenix.

 Paul Runge, making his third All-Star appearance, will be the home plate 
umpire for the July 12 All-Star Game at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioner's office said that Runge will be joined by fellow National 
Leaguers Jerry Layne at second base and Bill Hohn in left field, and American 
League umpires Jim Joyce in right field, Rocky Roe at third base and John 
Shulock at first.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; KLESKO GETS THE CALL AND HELPS BRAVES WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second night in a row, a decision on a home run was reversed by 
umpires -- this time in favor of the hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sixth inning of the Atlanta Braves' 8-3 victory over the Florida 
Marlins at Miami, Ryan Klesko's 15th home run gave the Braves a 6-1 lead. The 
ball hit the screen on the left-field foul pole and was ruled foul by 
third-base umpire Terry Tata and home-plate umpire Eric Gregg. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox protested, the umpires met and reversed 
the decision. Marlin Manager Rene Lachemann was enraged and went from umpire to 
umpire protesting until he was finally ejected for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great," said Klesko. "First it was rush, then it got taken away, and 
then it came back again. It was a weird situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann called it incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball was fair," said Lachemann. "I was upset with the fact that there was 
two guys who were on the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Tata said he and Gregg didn't have the perfect angle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball was hit deep and when it came down I saw it hit the warning track in 
foul territory," Tata said. "I went to Eric and he saw the same thing. I went 
to other guys because they had a different angle. I took the responsibility to 
change the call." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday night, Seattle Manager Lou Pinella was ejected after a argument 
when the Mariners' Mike Blowers had an apparent home run changed to a 
ground-rule double on the pretense of fan interference. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 9, Colorado 7 -- Jose Oquendo, who came into the game following a 
bench-clearing brawl, singled in the go-ahead runs in the seventh inning at St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Oquendo went into the game after Geronimo Pena was ejected for his part during 
the sixth-inning brawl. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockies loaded the bases in the ninth before Omar Olivares struck out 
Dante Bichette for the final out to earn his first save. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied 7-7 in the seventh, the Cardinals loaded the bases on a 
walk to Ozzie Smith, a single by Ray Lankford and an intentional walk to Mark 
Whiten. Oquendo then grounded a single to right off Mike Munoz. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 6, Cincinnati 4 -- Orlando Merced's two-run double highlighted a 
four-run eighth inning as the Pirates extended their home winning streak to 
eight games in moving within 5 1/2 games of the first-place Reds in the Central 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Merced extended his hitting streak to a current major league-high 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 3, San Diego 1 -- Todd Hundley's hit-and-run double drove in the 
go-ahead run in the eighth inning at San Diego as the Mets ended a five-game 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundley's hit made a winner of Bret Saberhagen (8-4), who gave up one run and 
five hits in seven innings. He struck out nine and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie right-hander Joey Hamilton (4-3) also pitched well, yielding five hits 
in 7 1/3 innings, but he gave up three runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 5, Chicago 3 -- Pete Harnisch came off the disabled list to limit the 
Cubs to three hits in six innings and Luis Gonzalez hit a three-run homer to 
lead the Astros at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Harnisch, who was activated before the game after being on the disabled list 
since May 23 with a partial tear in his right shoulder, gave up two runs and 
didn't yield a walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 7, San Francisco 3 -- Juan Bell hit a two-run homer and Larry Walker 
also homered and drove in two runs at Candlestick Park as the Expos handed the 
Giants their third consecutive loss.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; BERNSTEIN HOPES NEW HEADGEAR CHANGES LUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Bernstein is wearing new headgear these days. Gone is the blue baseball 
cap the trainer wore for good luck during much of the Santa Anita meeting, 
replaced by a green model with "The Wicked North" inscribed in orange letters 
across the front. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Bernstein, there is a simple explanation for the change. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all know what happened with the other one," he said, referring to The 
Wicked North's controversial disqualification in the Santa Anita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop from first to fourth in the Big 'Cap was The Wicked North's only 
"defeat" in his last four races, and the 5-year-old Far North horse is the 6-5 
favorite to win the $750,000 Hollywood Gold Cup on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no surprises when entries were taken for the Grade I stake Thursday 
morning. The five horses expected to be entered -- The Wicked North, Arcangues, 
Del Mar Dennis, Slew Of Damascus and Fanmore -- were and this is the third time 
a field so small has run in the Gold Cup. There also were five-horse fields in 
1958 and 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Native Diver won the last of his three Gold Cups under Jerry Lambert in 1967 
and Gallant Man, under high weight of 130 pounds, won as the prohibitive 2-5 
choice with Bill Shoemaker riding in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallant Man is one of 26 favorites to have won in the first 54 runnings of the 
1 1/4-mile race and Bernstein is hoping The Wicked North can make the chalk 
players happy again Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "His work last Saturday (five furlongs in 59 seconds) was very impressive," 
Bernstein said. "Kent (Desormeaux, the jockey) said it was the smoothest he's 
been in a long, long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Wicked North) seems to do what he has to do and we're the passenger. 
It's more a jockey's race than anything (when the field is small), and I've 
seen some major upsets in these short fields. I hope it doesn't happen again. 
But if this horse fires his best race, he'll be mighty tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to the main track for the first time since his 133-1 upset in the 
Breeders' Cup Classic, Arcangues is the 5-2 second choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Richard Mandella has been working the 6-year-old in company to get him 
to relax behind horses. Arcangues was too close early and faded to fifth in the 
Hollywood Turf Handicap on May 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Along those lines, Mandella has also switched riders, reuniting Arcangues with 
Jerry Bailey, who rode him in the Breeders' Cup. Bailey takes over for Eddie 
Delahoussaye, who had ridden the son of Sagace in the Turf Handicap and before 
that to a victory in the John Henry Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The change) is more a credit to my insecurity than a reflection on Eddie's 
riding ability," Mandella said. "I made a quick decision and the last thing I'd 
want to do is belittle Eddie Delahoussaye over it. He's one of the best riders 
in the world and one of my favorite people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've concentrated on working him in company and dragging him back and 
catching another horse. He's training the best he has since I've had him, and 
it appears that it will take the race of his career to beat The Wicked North, 
the way that horse is running right now. The rest of them aren't pushovers, 
either." 
</P>
<P>
 Del Mar Dennis, a disappointing fifth in the Californian after three 
consecutive victories, including stakes successes in the Mervyn LeRoy and San 
Bernardino, drew the rail Saturday. The Wicked North is right outside him, then 
come Slew Of Damascus, who will be ridden for the first time by Gary Stevens, 
Arcangues and Fanmore, who will be making his main track debut for trainer 
Bobby Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Entries were drawn Thursday for the two other stakes on the card. Eight 
3-year-olds were entered in the $163,600 Affirmed Handicap at 1 1/8 miles and 
seven sprinters are set for the $108,400 Triple Bend Handicap at seven 
furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
 Argolid, fourth in the Harry Henson Stakes on June 17 in his first race since 
the Louisiana Derby on March 19, is the probable favorite in the Affirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Valenzuela will ride for trainer Bob Baffert against a field that includes 
Pollock's Luck, Little Lite Bud, Timbalier, Scenic Route, R Friar Tuck and the 
Frankel-trained entry of Press Baron and Wild Invader. 
</P>
<P>
 Memo, the beaten choice at Churchill Downs in his last start, will probably be 
favored in the Triple Bend, but he could be compromised by his rail draw. 
Slerp, J.F. Williams, Supermec, Minjinsky, Codified and Mister Jolie complete 
the field. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Mr Purple, a 2-year-old son of Deputy Minister, was impressive breaking his 
maiden in his debut in Thursday's third race. Owned by Alex Campbell Jr., 
trained by Ron McAnally and ridden by Chris McCarron, the half brother of 
Queens Court Queen beat the highly regarded Houston Sunrise and five others in 
57 3/5 for the five furlongs. . . . Phone Chatter, sidelined since she wrapped 
up an Eclipse Award with a victory over Sardula in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile 
Fillies, worked three furlongs in 39 4/5 Thursday morning. This was her first 
workout as she prepares for a comeback after surgery late last year to repair a 
broken cannon bone in her rear left leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Jockey David Flores was off his mounts Thursday when his wife, Martha, gave 
birth to the couple's third child, a girl. . . . Lakeway worked five furlongs 
in 1:00 4/5 and Sardula went six furlongs in 1:11, preparing for their rematch 
in the $200,000 Hollywood Oaks on July 10.

L.A. BAPTIST PASSING CONNECTION FINDS SAME WAVELENGTH TO LEAD WEST, 14-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 L.A. Baptist High's unbeatable passing combination resorted to its old tricks 
Thursday in the 15th annual Daily News All-Star football game to pace the 
West's 14-0 victory over the East in front of an estimated 4,000 at Birmingham 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 When L.A. Baptist quarterback Zack Hernandez and receiver Jim Romero work 
together, it's as if they share a brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were struck by the same thought late in the second quarter when the West 
broke from its huddle on first and goal at the East seven-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 The play called in the huddle was a pitch to the running back, but Hernandez 
and Romero both noticed that the play would not succeed when they saw the 
defensive formation. 
</P>
<P>
 No problem. This pair, which led L.A. Baptist to a Southern Section Division X 
title and a 13-0 record seven months ago, has done this innumerable times in 
the past.  
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez slapped the side of his helmet and touched his hip. Romero responded 
with a hand signal and all systems were go. Hernandez lofted a perfect pass to 
Romero, who ran a fade pattern to the right corner of the end zone for a 6-0 
lead with 4 minutes 36 seconds left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have an audible in this all-star game," said Hernandez, the 
Division X player of the year, who threw for 3,634 yards and 26 touchdowns for 
the Knights last year. "It was so weird because I knew we couldn't run the play 
(that was called) and I looked over and Romero was standing there. And I was 
like, 'Oh, this is perfect.' " 
</P>
<P>
 To hear Romero tell it, Hernandez might as well have yelled, Jim, run a fade 
to the corner. "I was hoping no one saw it," Romero said. "It was kinda scary 
because I thought he made it too obvious." 
</P>
<P>
 It also was obvious that Hernandez and Romero can compete against players from 
larger schools. Hernandez outshined the three other premier quarterbacks in the 
game, rolling out repeatedly to complete nine of 14 passes for 120 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero, Cal-Hi Sports' state small schools athlete of year who is headed for 
Arizona on a football scholarship, caught five passes for 79 yards and rarely 
had trouble getting open. 
</P>
<P>
 The West increased its lead to 14-0 on a one-yard run by Reseda's DeWayne 
Johnson with 10 minutes 16 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez engineered the 75-yard drive, completing three of four passes for 50 
yards. Kennedy running back Donte Scarbrough chipped in 11 yards on three 
carries, finishing with a game-high 40 yards in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for a few long-yardage gains by Palmdale receiver Tony Coleman (four 
catches, 126 yards), the East struggled offensively. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar's Tyrone Crenshaw, the two-time City Section 4-A Division player of the 
year, had relatively little to do with the East's run-and-shoot scheme.  
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw, who is headed to Michigan State, carried five times for 14 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope Michigan State doesn't get into a run and shoot," Crenshaw said. 
"That's a runner's nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 East quarterbacks Mike Kocicka of Hart and Rocque Sandoval of Palmdale had a 
tough go of it against a swarming West defense. Kocicka and Sandoval were 
sacked seven times and completed only nine of 22 passes for 182 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The East got inside the West 10 on its final two drives, but couldn't punch 
the ball over. Reseda's Tyrone Francis picked off an underthrown pass by 
Kocicka in the end zone to stop one drive and Crenshaw was cut down at the two 
as time expired.

TRACK & FIELD / JOHN ORTEGA; THE JOHNNY O IS A SINGULAR DISTINCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that the high school track season is over for all intents and purposes -- 
only a few local athletes are still competing in age-group competition -- it's 
time for the first Johnny O awards honoring some of the region's top 
performers. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who are interested, the awards are based on the humble opinions and 
observations of track columnist John Ortega rather than the usual poll of Times 
writers. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's winners and some notable runners-up: Boys' Awards 
</P>
<P>
 Track athlete of the year: Jason Medearis of Hart placed second in the 
300-meter intermediate hurdles and fourth in the 110 highs in the State 
championships last month. 
</P>
<P>
 His best time of 36.80 seconds in the intermediates moved the Wyoming-bound 
Medearis to second on the all-time region list behind Charles White, who timed 
36.4 in the 330-yard intermediates for San Fernando in 1976, and his 14.12 
clocking in the highs moved him to sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramsey Jay of Ventura, who finished fourth in the 400 in the State meet, and 
Antonio Arce of Palmdale, second in the 3,200, rank second and third. 
</P>
<P>
 Arce finished higher than fellow junior Jay in the State championships, but 
Jay produced more high-quality marks over the course of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Field athlete of the year: Jeremy Fischer of Camarillo opened the outdoor 
season by clearing 7 feet 3 inches in a dual meet March 2 and won the USA Track 
& Field Junior championships on Saturday with a jump of 7-2 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 In between, he was undefeated outdoors, winning the Arcadia and Mt. San 
Antonio College invitational meets in April, the Southern Section Division I 
and Masters Meet championships in May, and the State, Golden West Invitational 
and National Scholastic Outdoor meets in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, who is headed to Wisconsin, set a region record of 7-4 in the Santa 
Barbara Easter Relays in March to move into a tie for eighth on the all-time 
national high school list and has cleared 7 feet or higher in 11 meets this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 He also spanned 23-2 in the long jump and finished second in that event in the 
Division I championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamaal Chase of Quartz Hill, runner-up in the triple jump in the State 
championships, and Esa Sallinen of Burroughs, fourth in the pole vault, fill 
the second and third spots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kansas State-bound Chase ranks third on the all-time region list in the 
triple jump at 49-11 and is sixth in the long jump at 24-2 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Sallinen, an exchange student from Finland, ranks fourth in the pole vault at 
16-4 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Track performance of the year: Medearis' 36.80 clocking in the intermediates 
at the Masters Meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Field performance of the year: Fischer's 7-4 jump in the high jump in the 
Santa Barbara Easter Relays. 
</P>
<P>
 Most consistent performer: Fischer cleared 7 feet or higher in the high jump 
in 11 meets, and Medearis ran between 14.12 and 14.30 in the high hurdles nine 
times, but Camarillo junior Eleazar Hernandez edged them in a close contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez posted a best of 9 minutes 10.96 seconds in the 3,200 to finish 
seventh in the State championships and ran 9:18.99 or faster seven times. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising star award: Moses Backus of Taft was a member of the Toreadors' 400 
relay team as a sophomore in 1993, but he stood out individually this season 
when he ran 22.3 in the 200 and 49.59 in the 400. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on his fourth-place finish in the 400 in the City Section championships 
in May, Backus appears to have the talent to crack the 48-second barrier next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls' Awards 
</P>
<P>
 Track athlete of the year: Cathy Prater of Agoura was runner-up in the 300 low 
hurdles in the State championships and also won the Southern Section Division I 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 Her best of 43.62 ranks sixth on the all-time region list. 
</P>
<P>
 Prater, who will run cross-country and track for UC Davis, also ran 15.32 in 
the 100 high hurdles and 26.00 in the 200 to rank third and fifth on the yearly 
region list. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks sophomore Kim Mortensen and Rio Mesa junior Andrea Wasden are 
ranked second and third. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortensen finished fifth in the 3,200 in the State championships, won the 
1,600 and 3,200 in the Southern Section Division I meet, and led the region in 
both events with times of 5:01.27 and 10:53.65. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasden finished a disappointing ninth in the final of the 100 high hurdles in 
the State meet, but posted a region-leading time of 14.37 in the preliminaries 
and also finished second in the Southern Section Division II championships.  
</P>
<P>
 She also ran 25.2 in the 200 and 44.5 in the 300 lows to rank second and third 
on the region list. 
</P>
<P>
 Field athlete of the year: Dolores Tuimoloau of Channel Islands moved into a 
tie for seventh on the all-time state list in the shotput with a mark of 49-2 
and established a Ventura County record of 145-0 in the discus, her secondary 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 She lost only once in the shotput and capped her season by winning the State 
championships and Golden West Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 High jumpers Liz Giltner of Chaminade and Kathy Watson of Saugus are the No. 2 
and 3 performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Giltner, a freshman, finished sixth in the State championships and her 
personal best of 5-8 ties her for 10th on the all-time region list. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, a senior, moved into a tie for fourth on the all-time region list when 
she cleared 5-10 to win her second consecutive Southern Section Division I 
title, but she was academically ineligible for the first half of the season and 
placed seventh in the State meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Track performance of the year: Prater's 43.62 in the 300 lows at the State 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Field performance of the year: Tuimoloau's 49-2 to win the Ventura County 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Most consistent performer: Giltner cleared 5-6 or higher in nine meets, topped 
by the 5-8 effort that tied for second in the Masters Meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising star award: Giltner and sprinter-long jumper Michelle Perry of Quartz 
Hill each had superb freshman campaigns, but both were well known in youth 
track circles prior to the season. 
</P>
<P>
 That contrasts sharply with the winner, Nordhoff freshman Bridie Hatch, an 
unknown quantity who ran 44.89 in the 300 lows in her first track season. 
</P>
<P>
 After running 48.0 to win the 330-yard lows in the Frontier League 
championships, Hatch went on a tear, running 45.87 in the Southern Section 
Division III preliminaries, 45.74 to win the final and 44.89 to place sixth in 
the Masters Meet.

KARL LEARNS HIS PLACE IN SUPERSONICS' ORGANIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His frustrating draft-day work done, Seattle SuperSonic Coach George Karl 
finished a bottle of beer and was ready to start on another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you think they'll fire me for drinking a beer?" Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
 No, George. But SuperSonic owner Barry Ackerley might fire you if the team 
doesn't live up to his championship expectations next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl's lack of control over his destiny was evident in Wednesday's NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrust into the unfamiliar role of running the team's draft, Karl was close to 
landing one of the game's premier players in Chicago's Scottie Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Ackerley apparently said no. 
</P>
<P>
 For Karl, it was NBA reality at its devastating worst. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl thought he had a better chance to win a title with Pippen than with Shawn 
Kemp, the player the Bulls wanted for their four-time All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to coach the best team possible," Karl said. "We're not going to say 
there's anyone unprotectable or untradeable." 
</P>
<P>
 Ackerley apparently nixed the deal because he was afraid of a season-ticket 
holders' backlash if the Sonics lost the spectacular and popular Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
 By telling Karl he couldn't make the trade, Ackerley in effect told him who 
was calling the shots. It's Ackerley's team, not Karl's. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl must win next season and he must win on Ackerley's terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl and draft consultant Wally Walker took one small chance. They traded 
second-round pick Zeljko Rebraca, a nondescript 6-foot-11, 198-pound center 
from Yugoslavia who was the 54th and final pick in the draft, to Minnesota for 
the Timberwolves' 1996 second-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I called him on it," Karl said. "We're very powerful on 
second-round picks." 
</P>
<P>
 The sarcasm in his voice reflected his frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls said the Sonics wanted to trade Kemp to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl said otherwise. The Bulls wanted the deal, he said. The Sonics listened, 
then rejected it, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you we have never shopped Shawn Kemp since I've been here," Karl 
said. "But a team did present a trade to us that we did consider. I will not 
deny that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sonics had an NBA- and franchise-best 63-19 record this season. Then, they 
held a two-games-to-none lead over Denver in a first-round playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, they've been in a slump. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuggets did the unexpected and came back to eliminate Seattle from the 
playoffs 3-2. Then Bob Whitsitt, the NBA executive of the year, told Ackerley 
he wanted out of the final three years of his five-year contract as president 
and general manager of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Ackerley let Whitsitt out of his contract but not without considerable pain. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994-95 season could be explosive. If the Sonics' slump continues, it 
could cost Karl his job.

NASCAR NOTEBOOK; GANT HOPES TO BOW OUT WITH ONE MORE VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harry Gant, preparing for his final run at Daytona International Speedway, 
says there's one more goal he'd like to achieve before ending his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "To win one Winston Cup race this year. That's it. That would satisfy me 
totally," Gant said Thursday. "It doesn't matter where. Just anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Gant, who hasn't finished better than seventh in a race this year, plans to 
retire in November after 30 seasons in racing. He has mixed feelings about 
leaving the Winston Cup circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel any different in the car now than I did 10 years ago, but the 
travel and motel and being gone all the time are things that start getting to 
you after that many years," Gant said. "You know you're going to miss a lot of 
people, friends you've made over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting in the race car, that's going to be the thing that I don't know how 
it'll affect me." 
</P>
<P>
 Gant, who had a qualifying speed of 186.784 m.p.h. (26th best) for Saturday's 
Pepsi 400, has never won a Winston Cup race at Daytona. He did win a modified 
NASCAR race here in 1977 and lists it among his most memorable moments on the 2 
1/2-mile high-banked trioval. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Daytona sweeps: Sterling Marlin, who shook the label of being perhaps the best 
driver who had never won a Winston Cup race when he took the Daytona 500 in 
February, thinks he has a good shot at becoming only the fifth driver to win 
both big races at Daytona in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fireball Roberts won the Daytona 500 and Firecracker 250 in 1962, and Cale 
Yarborough and Lee Roy Yarbrough were back-to-back 500-400 winners, in 1968-69. 
The last driver to accomplish the double was Bobby Allison in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlin returned to Daytona this week with plenty of good-luck charms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got out my uniform from the 500. . . . I've got the T-shirt I had on, but 
I can't find the rest of my underwear. I don't know where they went, but I'd 
like to find them with the luck we've had lately." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Remembering Davey: The next two events will be emotional for Ernie Irvan, who 
acknowledged he has given some thought to how it will feel to compete at 
Loudon, N.H., site of Davey Allison's last race, and at Pocono where the No. 28 
car sat out to mourn Allison's death last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvan, now well established as the driver of the Robert Yates Racing 
Thunderbird, said it will be difficult to block out the memories, but "we've 
got to keep on doing what we've been doing." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have thought about Loudon, where we last saw Davey," Irvan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started next to each other, and we shared a pace truck before the race and 
rode around the track. And I think about us squirting each other with squirt 
guns in the garage last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "(NASCAR flag man) Doyle Ford came up and he or Davey had a squirt gun and we 
were firing it at each other. He was parked on one side of the workbench and we 
were parked on the other. And we'd hide behind the bench and act like kids." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Show car: Wally Dallenbach failed to make the field at Michigan two weeks ago 
in the same Pontiac his team failed to qualify at Atlanta earlier this season. 
The car didn't make the trip to Daytona for this weekend's race. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did what we should have done earlier and made it a show car," Dallenbach 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not lately: Two teams have monopolized Victory Lane at Daytona International 
Speedway since the track opened in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 In 71 races, including the Daytona 500 and the Pepsi 400, the Wood brothers 
have won 12 times and Petty Enterprises 11 times on the track -- but not 
lately. 
</P>
<P>
 The last victory by a Wood Brother car was in July, 1983, when Buddy Baker 
won. The Petty team last took the checkered flag for any race in July 1984 with 
Richard Petty behind the wheel. Both Baker and Petty have since retired from 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Next behind the top two teams in victories at Daytona are Junior Johnson, 
Harry Melling and Smokey Yunick, with four victories each.

STUDENTS ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF AN ANCIENT ART; MUSIC: A MASTER VIOLIN MAKER 
HAS SET UP SHOP AT CAL LUTHERAN FOR TWO WEEKS, DRAWING ENTHUSIASTS FROM AS FAR 
AWAY AS BRAZIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On one side of the room, Julie Katana, with two sets of eyeglasses perched on 
her nose, bends over the top half of a viola, planing the surface into sheer 
smoothness with tiny, meticulous strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other, Harold Hirsch brushes hot glue on the maple frame of a cello, 
while Jim Viele sits patiently next to two slabs of pale wood just barely 
beginning to resemble parts of a violin, waiting for directions on what to do 
next. 
</P>
<P>
 The three are among a class of 10 students learning a unique skill at Cal 
Lutheran University this summer; the centuries-old art of violin making in the 
Italian tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 They have come to Thousand Oaks from such far-flung places as Brazil and 
Hawaii, just to study with Karl Roy, a master violin maker from Germany who has 
been building stringed instruments for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-week class is the only one of its kind on the West Coast. When it ends 
Saturday, Roy will travel across the country to teach a similar session at the 
University of New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
 Building even just one instrument under the tutelage of Roy can take as long 
as three years, but his students say the skills he passes on are well worth the 
wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of the very best in the world," said Katana, a secretary from 
Stockton who began studying with Roy in 1991. "He holds nothing back. I expect 
I'll study with him at least another five years." 
</P>
<P>
 His students range from professionals such as native Brazilian Rafael Sando, 
who can bang out an entire violin in about two weeks, to complete novices such 
as Mike Krawtz, who is in his fourth year of classes with Roy and is nowhere 
near finishing his first violin. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 students spend five days a week inside a small classroom at Cal 
Lutheran that has been converted to a workshop. A plastic tarp on the floor is 
covered with wood shavings and sawdust, a band saw stands near a window and 
littered all around the room are the tools needed to create the curves and 
edges of a fine violin. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this class really is is how to use tools," Katana said. "That we end up 
with a violin in the end is almost incidental." 
</P>
<P>
 She watched Roy as he tapped on the edges of a violin frame to determine if 
they were even. He cocked his head and listened for the slightly off sound 
indicating something was not quite right. Hearing it, he pointed it out to 
student Charles Pracha and then began to expertly smooth out the edges with a 
planer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He makes it look so easy," Katana said enviously. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever Roy goes in the classroom he draws a crowd. When he shows Viele how 
to gouge out the top piece of his violin and form its gentle arching shape, all 
the students rush over to observe, even though all have already passed that 
stage themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe the training of a violin master still follows the same course it has 
for centuries. After three years of basic training at a school such as the 
Bavarian State School of Violin Making, where Roy used to teach, a young 
builder is sent out on a five-year apprenticeship. An exam follows, and passing 
it bestows upon him or her the status of master. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are a handful of violin-making schools in the United States, 
Sando said it was impossible to find formal training in Brazil.  
</P>
<P>
 Sando said he began playing the violin at age 15. And while he never 
considered himself much of a player, he became interested in making minor 
repairs to the instrument. He was trained as a physicist. 
</P>
<P>
 The acoustical aspects of the violin intrigued him, and before long he began 
to build them himself. Now he supports his wife and daughter by making violins 
and other stringed instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you make one you cannot stop," Sando said. "It's like a disease." 
</P>
<P>
 Viele started building violins in his San Diego garage several years ago. He 
made five, he said, using such untraditional materials as plywood and scraps of 
wood, things Roy would not allow in his classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Viele is proud of his garage creations, pulling a Polaroid 
photograph from one of his pockets and passing it around as though it was an 
image of his firstborn. 
</P>
<P>
 He checked several books out of the library on violin construction before 
enrolling in Roy's class. The idea of how-to books brought a grimace of utter 
disgust to the teacher's face. 
</P>
<P>
 "This art has never been written down or published," Roy said. "You have to 
study it on the bench. That is the only way it can be taught." 
</P>
<P>
 That said, he darts around the room, checking on the progress of his students, 
complaining about the quality of the makeshift equipment at Cal Lutheran and 
maintaining a firm but friendly teaching relationship with his admiring 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will get very angry if you're gouging that way," Roy warned Viele, as the 
student mishandled the sharp steel instrument, bringing it precariously close 
to his wrist. "Believe me, if you run into this, we will run into big problems 
with CLU. They don't like blood on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 After a quick demonstration from Roy, where the wood peeled off like butter 
and each stroke of the gouge ended with a flourish, Viele revised his grip on 
the instrument and took more careful aim at the piece of wood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much better," Roy told him. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the students welcome any encouraging word from the master, the class 
is not a competitive one. Because it is open to professionals and amateurs, 
people such as Krawtz are welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Krawtz, who is from the island of Maui in Hawaii, has traveled to New 
Hampshire three times and Cal Lutheran once. He is far behind students such as 
Sando, still concentrating hard on gouging out the inside of the instrument's 
top half. 
</P>
<P>
 For him, the work itself is pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really plan to finish at the rate I'm going," he said. "But if I do, 
I think I'll hang it on the wall and just look at it."

WORKERS' COMP FRAUD SUSPECT ORDERED TO TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After viewing tapes of the defendant riding a motorcycle and painting his 
garage, a judge ordered a Camarillo sales executive to stand trial on charges 
that he lied about being disabled and illegally collected nearly $7,000 in 
workers' compensation benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Griffis, 41, could become the first defendant in Ventura County to take a 
case of workers' compensation fraud before a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, he became the first county resident ever to be charged with the 
crime. But two other defendants charged with workers' comp fraud since then 
have pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffis' attorney said his client will not admit to any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "My client is definitely not going to plead guilty to a crime that he did not 
commit," attorney David P. Callahan said after court, adding that Griffis 
received benefits only after his physician reported his injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of your stranger cases," the attorney said. "It's a workers' comp 
fraud case without a workers' comp claim filed by my client." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Superior Court Judge Allan L. Steele ordered Griffis to stand 
trial on three counts of workers' comp fraud and one other count of theft after 
listening to more than five hours of testimony at a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffis' doctor told the judge that he felt Griffis had neck, back and 
shoulder injuries, but now believes Griffis exaggerated their severity during a 
series of medical examinations. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also viewed investigators' surveillance tape of Griffis riding the 
motorcycle, slipping a motorcycle helmet on and off and painting his garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffis first started seeing doctors for cervical problems in March, 1993, 
after he injured his cervical disc while helping a fellow employee move a file 
cabinet down a set of stairs, lawyers on both sides agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Callahan said the other worker, who was on the bottom side of the cabinet, 
slipped on the stairs and that Griffis injured himself while trying to aid his 
colleague. He said a Magnetic Resonance Imaging test, an X-ray-like test known 
as an MRI, showed evidence of a serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors say that any injury Griffis suffered healed quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffis started receiving benefits after Dr. Alan M. Gross of Oxnard told 
state officials that the defendant was temporarily and totally disabled, 
Callahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gross testified Thursday that Griffis had misrepresented his injuries 
during medical examinations in March, April and July of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 With cervical injuries, he said, doctors generally have to take the word of 
clients about their level of discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Griffis, Gross said, "I was entirely convinced that there was a 
cervical disc (injury). Completely convinced." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite treatment, Griffis' condition did not seem to improve, Gross 
testified. Finally, Gross said he recommended that Griffis undergo surgery last 
July. Griffis, he said, balked at the suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 The month after that visit, investigators with the State Compensation 
Insurance Fund showed Gross a tape they had taken during six days of shadowing 
Griffis' daily activities. 
</P>
<P>
 While Gross had advised Griffis not to even hold his hands above his head due 
to his alleged injuries, Gross said the tape showed Griffis painting, riding 
the motorcycle and putting on a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It leads you to believe that you have been duped," Gross testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Rhonda Schmidt said state investigators became suspicious 
of Griffis after he stopped making regular visits to his doctor and his 
physical therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said the tape shows Griffis going to work every day while he was 
supposedly totally disabled and collecting benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 She said authorities believed that Griffis did suffer a minor injury while 
moving the cabinet. But that he "lied to Dr. Gross in terms of the seriousness 
of his injuries."

HOME SALES NEAR FULL RECOVERY, ANALYSTS SAY; REAL ESTATE: VENTURA COUNTY 
RECORDS ITS 10TH STRAIGHT MONTH OF INCREASED TRANSACTIONS. 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura County's real estate market has almost recovered from the effects of 
recession after a 10-month stretch of increasing home sales, industry analysts 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had 10 consecutive months of increasing sales and that signifies a 
trend to me," said Nima Nattagh, a market analyst with TRW REDI, which 
publishes monthly reports on home sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The research firm's most recent report focuses on the first five months of 
1994, but Nattagh said sales have been steadily rising throughout Southern 
California since last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Nattagh attributed increased sales from January to May to low interest rates, 
an improving economic climate, and the availability of affordable homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of sales in the county from January to May increased 18.2% over 
sales in the same five-month period of 1993. Some real estate agents expressed 
worry over steadily decreasing prices--down an average of 2.2% from 1993 to 
1994--but Nattagh said low prices were crucial to driving the market toward 
full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prices are still fairly soft," Nattagh said. "But I think that is a blessing 
in disguise in that it encourages more first-time buyers to get into the 
market. I think they will be the backbone of the recovery. If you don't have 
first-time buyers, you don't have move-up buyers either." 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting that trend, sales were up in most of the county's 10 cities, but 
buying was concentrated in lower-priced areas, including Oxnard, Simi Valley 
and Ventura, where average purchase prices were less than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, 154 homes were sold in May, averaging $184,600, compared to last 
May when 107 homes were sold at an average cost of $196,658. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Edwards, president of the Oxnard Harbor Assn. of Realtors, which includes 
22 realtors from Oxnard, Channel Islands Harbor and Port Hueneme, said most of 
the buyers are first-time owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Primarily the people buying were formerly renters," Edwards said. "We're 
seeing a lot of people in the agriculture industry, with two to three wage 
earners in the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme is popular with buyers right now, he said, as well as the west 
side of Oxnard. Most of the houses Edwards is selling are 25 to 35 years old 
and have been newly refurbished. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of them are going for under $175,000," Edwards said. "These are 
affordable houses, three or four bedrooms. We have a good market for that 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 But Edwards said he wasn't ready to proclaim the market restored to 
pre-recession levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an almost average market," he said. "Put it this way: On a scale from 
A to F, we've been in a D- market for the last few years. Today we're in a C to 
C- market. It's still not quite average but it's better than it was." 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, the average price of property sold in the last six months was 
$194,948, a drop of 5.2% from the same period in 1993, according to the Simi 
Valley-Moorpark Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanon Wolf, the association's president, said Simi Valley continues to 
attract buyers seeking safe havens to raise children. She also characterized 
prices as "soft," but predicted they would begin to increase soon. The 
difference between list price and final sale price on homes has narrowed 
considerably, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be interesting to see what our July and August figures are 
like," Wolf said. "We've had a lot of clients in looking in the middle to upper 
price range lately." Ventura County Home Sales 05,15,11,12,11,12 City May, 1993

COUNTY TOLD OF POSSIBLE LIBRARY STAFF CUTS, CLOSURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County's libraries could be forced to cut half their staffs and shut 
down all but three of their branches if the Board of Supervisors does not come 
through with the $1.6-million contribution it provided last year, the county's 
library director said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is simply not feasible to run a county library, serving a population of 
419,150, serving seven cities and all of the unincorporated areas, with a 
geographically distributed set of facilities, at this staffing level," library 
Director Dixie D. Adeniran told the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors expressed sympathy, but stressed that they could not yet 
guarantee the same level of support for the libraries and other popular 
programs in the face of state cuts and the county's own mounting deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very much opposed to reducing veteran services and library services, but 
where do we go?" Supervisor Vicky Howard asked. "After three years of cutting, 
I'm at a point where I'm numb and I really don't know what to cut anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard's remarks came at the end of two weeks of budget study sessions, which 
sets the stage for county staff members next week to release their proposed 
spending plan for fiscal 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's library director was not the only official Thursday to warn of 
painful decisions with additional budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Social services officials told the board how proposed cuts would force them to 
drop programs for veterans, senior citizens and the homeless. Public works 
officials projected staff cuts in mapping and surveying offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The only good news came from the county's acting fire chief, Robert Holaway, 
who said his department could afford to buy three new fire engines and other 
equipment without added help from the county -- and without the Proposition 172 
tax revenue that firefighters fought so hard for four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A one-time boost in revenue, which included reimbursement for the work in 
October's firestorms, should cover the costs of equipment and fire station 
improvements, Holaway said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Maffei, who heads the Ventura County Firefighters Assn., called Holaway's 
viewpoint shortsighted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may have the funding right now to maintain the status quo, but that's not 
the point of Proposition 172," Maffei said. Instead, he said the new revenue 
should be used to enhance and expand existing services. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, firefighters sought a chunk of the $24 million in revenue from last 
year's extension of a half-cent sales tax and reacted angrily when the 
supervisors devoted the money exclusively to the Sheriff's Department and 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, those departments could face cutbacks as the board contemplates 
how to deal with $10 million to $12 million in state reductions on top of its 
own $16-million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other programs, the library system and the Fire Department receive a 
separate pool of property taxes to pay their costs. Last year, the state 
threatened to take back some of that money and decimate the special districts. 
</P>
<P>
 At the last minute, fire districts were exempted, but libraries lost 
significant funds. In fact, since 1991 Ventura County libraries have lost 
one-third of their funding and two-fifths of their staff members. Library hours 
have dropped by half, Adeniran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the supervisors agreed to contribute $1.6 million to keep more 
libraries open longer. Unless they agree to make a contribution again this 
year, libraries could lose as many as 38 of their remaining 77 staff members, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board could find the money in a proposed $4-million contingency fund set 
aside for emergencies, or could add it to its deficit for the fiscal year that 
begins today, said Bert Bigler, the county's budget director. 
</P>
<P>
 Two supervisors, Maria VanderKolk and John K. Flynn, said they were committed 
to providing the library money. The three remaining members said they wanted to 
find the money, but needed to know the extent of state cuts and weigh the 
damage facing other departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to hear from everybody and we need to think about this for a while," 
Supervisor Maggie Kildee said. "Clearly the library is incredibly important, 
but I'm not going to make a commitment today." 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk said she was prepared to sacrifice programs for veterans and 
homeless people to make sure her favorite programs get priority funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot justify cutting a library and cutting public safety until we cut 
those programs," she said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn disagreed, saying he would fight to save the $115,900 the county pays 
for the veterans services office. The program handled 1,600 cases in the past 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "But John, the point is we don't have the money," VanderKolk argued. "Why 
would we choose the veterans program over a library?"

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY BLAMED FOR STALLED FIRE TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ventura County fire union officials said Thursday that contract talks have 
stalled because county officials refused to allow a tape recorder during 
contract negotiations and walked out of negotiations recently. 
</P>
<P>
 With the current contract expiring Saturday, Ventura County and fire officials 
said that they do not expect to have a new contract ready, and that 
firefighters will continue to work under the existing contract until a new 
agreement is reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Maffei, president of the Ventura County Professional Firefighters' Assn., 
said talks with the county began about four months ago. According to Maffei, 
union officials have not requested salary increases and asked to continue 
working under their existing contract for 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Maffei said county officials asked about one-third of the 378-member union to 
take a 5% pay cut. Union officials agreed, but only if management would also 
take a 5% pay cut, Maffei said. "Of course, they rejected that idea," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maffei said union officials want the negotiations recorded because they think 
that contract negotiations will heat up later and the dispute will be decided 
by a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want an accurate record in case it's litigated," Maffei said. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials declined to comment on the negotiations except to say that 
firefighters will continue to work under the current contract after it expires 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's treated as if it's in effect," said Ed McClean, assistant personnel 
director. "As long as they continue to come to work, we pay their salaries and 
benefits." PEGGY Y. LEE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: HIGH SMOG PROMPTS HEALTH ADVISORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 High winds pushed unhealthful air from the San Fernando Valley into Simi 
Valley and surrounding areas Thursday, prompting Ventura County officials to 
declare a health advisory for much of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Levels of ozone, an invisible irritant that impairs breathing, reached a high 
of 138 on the Pollutant Standard Index Thursday.Levels between 101 and 199 on 
the scale are considered unhealthful. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County forecasters blamed the persisting high pressure system that has 
been pushing temperatures up over Southern California in conjunction with winds 
coming out of the Los Angeles area for the high smog levels here. 
</P>
<P>
 Meteorologist Kent Field of the Ventura County Pollution Control District said 
injections of smog from the San Fernando Valley are more common late in the 
summer and can be blamed on unusual weather patterns over this part of the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 A new weather system developing off the coast should help lower the smog 
levels, but not before the weekend, Field said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have a chance for high smog over the weekend, but the weather system 
that's causing this problem is weakening," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters are predicting ozone levels at 95 on the PSI for Simi Valley 
today. Levels between 51 and 100 are considered moderate on the index. 
</P>
<P>
 Field advised that residents of the Simi Valley and surrounding areas should 
try to avoid strenuous outdoor activity in the afternoon when smog levels are 
highest. MATTHEW MOSK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; DRIVER DIES AS TRUCK JUMPS FREEWAY 
DIVIDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A tractor without a trailer flipped from a southbound lane on the Ventura 
Freeway over to the northbound lanes in Camarillo on Thursday, killing the 
driver and spilling 75 gallons of diesel fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident, which occurred about 8:30 a.m. during rush-hour, backed up 
traffic for more than eight miles, as far as the Conejo Grade on the northbound 
side, and as far as the Santa Clara River bridge on the southbound side. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, Mark Butcher, 44, of Ojai was crushed by the tractor and was 
pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another tractor-trailer and a small car collided while trying to avoid the 
tractor, but the drivers of those vehicles were not hurt, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they do not know what caused Butcher to lose control and 
flip over the guardrail south of the Central Avenue off-ramp. An autopsy 
revealed no evidence of drug or alcohol use, and he apparently did not suffer a 
stroke or heart attack, said Jim Wingate, Ventura County deputy coroner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Physically, he was in excellent, excellent shape," Wingate said. 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher, who worked for trucking company U.S. Xpress, was on his way to 
Camarillo to pick up a load from Packard Bell Electronics, company officials 
said. He had been employed at the company for about four months and had a clean 
driving record. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol said Butcher lost control of his tractor and 
overturned from the southbound fast lane over the guardrail into the northbound 
fast lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramesh Raminali, who was driving a Toyota Celica in the northbound lanes, 
swerved to avoid Butcher's vehicle as it came over the guardrail. That caused 
Frank Talmadge, who was driving a tractor-trailer two lanes over, to swerve to 
avoid hitting Raminali, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 Raminali hit Talmadge's tractor-trailer, and Talmadge jackknifed the truck 
onto the right shoulder and crashed into a chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic on both sides of the Ventura Freeway was stalled for at least two 
hours while officials worked to clear the accident. CHP officers squeezed 
traffic from three lanes to one lane on both sides of the freeway. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PLANNERS CITE FLAWS IN PROPOSED PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to build townhouses and business offices on a 77-acre parcel near 
northern Ventura Avenue hit a snag this week when Ventura's planning 
commissioners said the project may contain major design flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 The property, most of which is zoned for industrial use, is largely owned by 
the Neel and Huntsinger families and Kinko's, the national copy service 
headquartered nearby. The families plan to turn the vacant lots and industrial 
businesses on the lemon-tree covered property into a neighborhood of 
townhouses, business offices and industrial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning commissioners, however, worried that the homes were planned too close 
to the freeway and an industrial area on the property's north side. On a 4-2 
vote, with commissioners Sandy Smith and Al Okuma opposing, the commissioners 
voted to reconsider the proposal at a meeting later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's developers had hoped to finish the commission review process 
before the City Council meets Wednesday to begin considering which proposals 
will get housing allocations this year. 
</P>
<P>
 City planner Mitch Oshinsky agreed that having the commission approve the 
project would have been an advantage, since none of the other proposals before 
the council are as far along in the approval process. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he added, the delay will not be a disadvantage for the developers in 
trying to get housing allocations. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, the developers said they were flabbergasted by the 
commission's criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, this is a very surprising, stunning thing," said Bill Neel, saying 
he was especially taken aback by a suggestion to drop the housing altogether 
and replace it with commercial businesses. "For five years, no one has 
recommended abandoning the residential zone. Now, I'm not sure what we're 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 The 77 acres are north of Stanley Avenue and south of Seneca Street. The 
property is bounded on the east by Ventura Avenue and on the west by the Ojai 
Freeway. The proposal includes construction of 330 residential units, a park, 
bike trails and business offices. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CHAMBER CHIEF ASKED TO QUIT AFTER 22 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The director of the Greater Ventura Chamber of Commerce has resigned after 22 
years as head of the organization, chamber officials announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Barroca, 60, said the chamber's executive board asked for his resignation 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised," said Barroca, who said the chamber is doing well 
financially. "It was kind of sudden." 
</P>
<P>
 Barroca declined further comment, and chamber officials would not discuss 
details of the resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief interview, however, chamber President Bob Alviani said the group 
regrets Barroca's departure. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also released a brief statement Thursday lauding the chamber's 
accomplishments during Barroca's tenure. Barroca's "contribution will be a 
challenge for any future director to match," it said. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 1,400 members, the group is the largest chamber of commerce in 
Ventura County, Barroca said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barroca said that his last day will be July 29 and that he has not yet made 
plans for the future. He said he may look for an administrative job with a 
nonprofit organization in Ventura County. CHRISTINA LIMA

 EARNED A REST? For 30 years, the talking Abraham Lincoln has been a major 
attraction at Disneyland. But every few years rumors surface that he'll be 
retired.This time they're true -- partially. . . . The mechanical president, 
who recites some of his most famous speeches in the Lincoln Theater just off 
the amusement park's Main Street, will soon take his first rest, making room

Making of the Lion King." But Lincoln returns daily at 2 p.m. and performs

 * LIBERTY TIME: When it comes to Independence Day celebrations, Knott's Berry 
Farm has an edge on other entertainment centers. It has the only re-created 
Independence Hall around. It also has its own batch of patriots who bring 
America's earliest days back to life each July holiday. . . . Among them: Gene 
Collins, who annually delivers Patrick Henry's famous "Give Me Liberty or Give 
Me Death" speech. He'll give four presentations each day, Saturday through 
Monday, inside the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 * TOUGHER PUFFS: The state of California plans to make it more expensive for 
you to smoke your favorite cigar or pipe tobacco. Beginning today, the state 
tax on non-cigarette tobacco goes up 8%. But Jim Allison, whose AA Tobacco Barn 
Pipe Show in Lake Forest has been in operation 65 years, says it will take a 
while before the consumer is aware of it: "The distributor will have it on his 
next billing, and then we'll pass it on to the customer." . . . But Allison 
doesn't expect it to deter anyone from smoking: "If you plan to buy a 
Rolls-Royce, it won't stop you if they raise the price a hundred dollars."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; COUNCIL OKS BUDGET WITHOUT TAX INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than a month of almost nightly meetings, the Moorpark City Council 
has adopted a $5.1 million general fund budget for this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council balanced the budget at its meeting Wednesday night without 
raising taxes.Instead it dipped into city reserves and transferred two 
employees to a different agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a long and sometimes frustrating experience, but we were able to 
finally balance the budget without laying anyone off," Mayor Paul Lawrason 
said. "That was one of my top priorities." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council saved some money by using space in an abandoned bank building 
downtown for a police storefront. The building will be used by a private 
company that does building safety inspections for the city. The company will 
pay for building renovations, which will include a corner police office that 
will be staffed by a Ventura County Sheriff's Department cadet and community 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrason said the city avoided laying off personnel by transferring two 
employees to the city's Redevelopment Agency, which has a separate budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager Richard Hare said the city had to dip into a reserve 
fund to keep from raising taxes or homeowners' fees for lighting, landscaping 
and park maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrason and Councilman Bernardo Perez were worried that residents wouldn't 
realize that the higher quality of park maintenance, landscaping and lighting 
is being subsidized by reserve funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said by artificially holding down the cost of park services, the city 
was setting residents up for a huge jump in their property tax assessment when 
the city finally depletes its reserve fund. SCOTT HADLY

CONTAMINATION CLOSES HOT TUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON GRANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Results of tests for bacteria levels in the hot tubs at the Wheeler Hot 
Springs resort near Ojai showed a continued high level of contamination 
Thursday, prompting Ventura County health officials to order the tubs to remain 
closed for at least part of the Fourth of July weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials made the decision Thursday after a third testing of the water 
used in the tubs showed high bacteria levels, said Bob Gallagher, a manager 
with the county's Environmental Health Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher said a fourth sample would probably be taken from the hot tub waters 
today. But results of the tests for fecal coliform would not be available 
before Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Marshall, general manager of the resort, said he met Thursday with county 
officials to discuss the tests, but he declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher said the resort is trying to disinfect its hot tub waters through 
"superchlorination," which entails dumping about 100 times the normal level of 
chlorine into the waters. 
</P>
<P>
 He said resort officials planned to superchlorinate the water Thursday night 
and take new water samples today. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher said his agency began investigating the level of bacteria in the 
water June 14 after a bather reported that he became ill after using one of the 
tubs. 
</P>
<P>
 After results came back showing bacteria levels in the tubs were too high, he 
ordered the tubs closed June 22. That first test, he said, showed levels of 
bacteria in hot tubs ranging from "less than 1 to greater than 6,500" colonies 
per milliliters. The acceptable level is 200 bacterial colonies per milliliter. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, Gallagher said, new water samples were taken June 23, and the 
initial results seemed acceptable, so tubs were allowed to reopen June 24 for 
the weekend's business. But, he said, long-term results from those tests came 
in Monday, again showing unacceptable bacteria levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The hot tubs have remained closed since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher said bathers who used the hot tubs last weekend are "likely safe," 
but added: "It's difficult for me to say because the samples did exceed the 
state standard." JASON GRANT

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; BID TO ALTER NAME OF HOUSTON STREET 
FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When there's only one fatal drive-by shooting in town, people tend to remember 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why 35 residents of Houston Drive recently petitioned the Thousand Oaks 
City Council to change their street name to Cameron Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 They wanted to erase their street's association with Thousand Oaks' sole 
drive-by slaying, which occurred on Houston Drive in June, 1991. And they hoped 
to drive away the young gangbangers who call themselves the Houston Hoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's common knowledge that there was a drive-by shooting on our street, and 
there's no question that our neighborhood is stigmatized by that," resident 
Andy Fox told the council on Tuesday. "Our property values did go down after 
the incident." 
</P>
<P>
 But after a brief debate, council members decided they could not support the 
name-change proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35 signatures represented barely half the families on Houston Drive. And 
petition passers made no attempt to get signatures from property owners, 
allowing renters to support the name change on behalf of absentee landlords. 
</P>
<P>
 With such a lackluster showing from the pro-Cameron Drive faction, council 
members decided they could not make the residents go through the inconvenience 
of changing their stationery, drivers' licenses, checkbooks and every other 
document listing their mailing addresses. On a 4-0 vote, they denied the name 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision cheered resident Debbie Bavaro, who called the proposed name 
change a "placebo" to make Houston Drive families feel safer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really, really think (petition organizers) should spend their energies 
elsewhere," Bavaro said. "Improving the community and making it a better place 
to live -- that's what's going to bring our property values up." STEPHANIE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; MAN TO PAY DAMAGES AFTER BOMBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County Superior Court judge ruled Thursday that a Moorpark man must 
pay damages for injuries that a homemade bomb caused to his wife's ex-husband 
and another woman, even though a court acquitted him last year in the 1992 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 James R. McKeever, 44, must pay medical and punitive damages of $5,000 apiece 
to his wife's former husband, John Monroe, and Monroe's wife, Charlene Mayer, 
Judge William L. Peck ruled. Peck's ruling upheld an earlier small-claims 
verdict in the couple's damage suit that was reached Dec. 27 by Municipal Court 
Commissioner David W. Long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a little justice has been done," said Mayer, who had to undergo skin 
grafts to repair flesh wounds to her leg caused by the homemade firebomb that 
exploded near her bed on Nov. 21, 1992. "Having him walk and tell everyone he 
wasn't guilty was hard to handle when the judgment came down on acquittal," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeever, who was acquitted May 6, 1993, could not be reached for comment 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyer, William Robinson, said: "I unequivocally believe from everything I 
have seen and know that Mr. McKeever is absolutely innocent of any wrongdoing." 
</P>
<P>
 The bomb, made out of a bleach bottle full of gasoline and other materials, 
exploded in the couple's bedroom at their Simi Valley home. Monroe threw 
blankets over the device, but he and his wife were injured in the blast. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson argued in court that Monroe built the bomb as part of an ongoing 
battle for custody of his son with his ex-wife, who is married to McKeever. He 
also argued that the eight-inch hole that firefighters found in the couple's 
bedroom window could not have been caused by the nine-inch-diameter device. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Mike Kwasigroch, attorney for Monroe and Mayer, argued that Simi 
Valley police found materials identical to the bomb's components at McKeever's 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good for my clients because they didn't bring this to court so much 
for monetary gain as to have it decided once and for all whether or not Mr. 
McKeever was culpable, and they feel vindicated," the attorney said. MACK REED

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK, NEWBURY PARK; SOME COLLEGE HORSES ALREADY 
SOLD, MOVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than half of 40 horses owned by the defunct Moorpark College Equine 
Program have been sold and transported out of state, a college official said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The news surprised at least one member of the Ventura County Community College 
District board of trustees, which was told last week by college President James 
Walker that all of the horses were still at the Rancho Sierra Vista facility in 
Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out two days (after the June 21 board meeting) that a number of the 
horses were gone," said Trustee Karen Boone, who was assured by Walker at the 
meeting that he never gave the equine program administrator permission to sell 
the horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need to get to the bottom of it and find out exactly what's going 
on," Boone said. "I understand the records are being looked at." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Walker nor Don Anderson, the retired equine instructor, were available 
for comment Thursday. But Darlene Pacheco, Moorpark College vice president, 
said more than 20 horses were sold and moved weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those horses had already been moved," she said Thursday. "They had already 
been sent to Landon Farms in Utah." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the horses are public property, Anderson told trustees that he was 
worried the horses would end up with people who sell horseflesh to dog food or 
other companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacheco said plans to close the equine program were approved by the college 
last year. "Dr. Anderson was proceeding in the manner that we agreed he would 
proceed," she said. "So they're gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, an independent appraiser has agreed to determine the value of 17 
horses that remain at the facility, which closed its doors after Saturday's 
final commencement ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials plan to hold a sealed bid auction that will accept bids until July 
15. JEFF McDONALD

PANEL DEADLOCKED ON GIVING DONORS SAY IN ARTS PLAZA OPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Debating their own fate, Thousand Oaks theater commissioners have deadlocked 
on whether to invite major donors to help them guide programming at the Civic 
Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 On a 3-3 vote late Wednesday night, with Commissioner Larry Sparrow absent, 
the panel reached a resounding "no decision" and turned the issue over to the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's most emotional speeches came from commissioners opposed to 
adding seats for private contributors who have pledged at least $50,000 to a 
cultural endowment fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money certainly buys a lot of things, but it doesn't buy taste or judgment," 
Commissioner Mary Hekhuis said. "To say major donors need such a voice is 
almost extortion." 
</P>
<P>
 The current theater commission consists of seven members appointed by the City 
Council for their expertise in fund-raising, their business or public relations 
skills, or their devotion to the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting monthly, the seven commissioners debate a host of policy issues, from 
allowing liquor sales at intermissions to charging for performance-night 
parking. They also oversee the cultural center's budget and will manage cash 
flow from the endowment once the theaters open in October. 
</P>
<P>
 All their votes are phrased as recommendations to the City Council, which 
generally rubber-stamps each decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Major donors should have no reason to fear (decisions made by) intelligent 
people representing the public," Hekhuis said. "This goes back to the beginning 
of democracy." But in fact, the current arrangement has spooked some potential 
donors, who are reluctant to give money to a pot controlled by a politically 
appointed panel, fund-raiser Chuck Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 To calm the would-be contributors, endowment campaign leaders have recommended 
expanding the Civic Theaters Commission by giving five seats to donors, two to 
arts organizations and one to the Alliance for the Arts fund-raising cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 They also propose shifting the theater commission from a public panel to a 
private, nonprofit governing board, thereby eliminating the need to post 
agendas and hold open meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 These changes could boost donations to the Alliance for the Arts endowment, 
fund-raising consultant Esther Wachtell said. With full coffers, she added, the 
endowment could subsidize children's programs, reduced ticket prices for 
seniors and other goodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we will wake up every morning and see a sea of yellow school buses 
outside the Civic Arts Plaza because we will have the funding to keep the 
children coming and keep the programming exciting for the next 75 years and 
beyond," Wachtell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those arguments earned her support from commissioners Larry Janss, Harry 
Selvin and Virginia Davis -- all major donors to the endowment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to know that the investment major donors make will not be 
subject to the whims of political winds," Janss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet by distancing the Civic Arts Plaza from public and political scrutiny, 
former Mayor Larry Horner argued, the commission could create "the perception 
that this is a big-money thing . . . being run by remote control from people in 
Los Angeles or Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Commissioner Julian Macdonald said, the donors who contribute to 
the endowment fund know their money is earmarked for the day-to-day operation 
of the Civic Arts Plaza theaters -- the light bills, the technical staff, and 
other nuts-and-bolts details. 
</P>
<P>
 If they wish to control programming, the same donors could put up funds to 
sponsor certain shows, like a symphony series or a rap concert, he said. GTE, 
for example, has agreed to fund a Spotlight Series featuring magician David 
Copperfield and the American Indian Dance Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners Macdonald, Hekhuis and Gib Poiry voted against giving votes to 
donors, while Janss, Davis and Selvin favored the proposal.

HOPE ARISES FOR STABLES IN PATH OF BULLDOZERS; NEWBURY PARK: A NEW SITE HAS 
BEEN FOUND NEARBY, BUT QUICK ACTION IS NEEDED BY THE CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Thousand Oaks politicians can't save the Two Winds stables site from a 
developer's bulldozers. 
</P>
<P>
 But they will try to prevent Newbury Park equestrians from riding off into the 
sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 Earning cheers from two dozen horse lovers, Thousand Oaks council members have 
agreed to move the Two Winds stables and corral across Potrero Road to the 
Broome Ranch wilderness tract. 
</P>
<P>
 With bulldozers revving in the distance, ready to tear down Two Winds to make 
room for housing, the city has to act fast. 
</P>
<P>
 And the equestrians are spurring them on. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they take this away from the kids, there are going to be a lot of hearts 
broken out there," said Frank de la Torre, who boards two horses at Two Winds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been our home away from home. It's been the greatest thing that's ever 
happened to us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With its easy access to backcountry trails and its picturesque location under 
the Santa Monica Mountains ridgeline, Two Winds has attracted equestrians from 
as far away as Orange County, manager Bob Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts regularly trek over to earn "horse care" merit 
badges by tending to the 142 animals stabled at Two Winds. Busloads of 
inner-city students come by to gawk at the galloping steeds. And Los Angeles 
police officers have visited the stables for weekend getaways from smog and 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The equestrian facility is part of a much bigger picture, part of our need to 
maintain open space and a rural atmosphere for everyone," said Jody Martin, who 
boards a horse at Two Winds. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the ranch's allure, Thousand Oaks council members Tuesday directed 
staff members to work as quickly as possible to secure a new site on Broome 
Ranch. Before a single horse trots across the street, however, city planners 
will have to jump some hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city has purchased half of Broome Ranch's 640 acres, the entire 
parcel remains within the county's sphere of influence. And the county has 
zoned the land "agricultural exclusive," a designation that would preclude 
equestrian facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 To get around that hitch, the city would have to apply for a special-use 
permit or petition the county to rezone Broome Ranch, assistant planner Mark 
Towne said. Eventually, Thousand Oaks might seek to annex the property. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, officials will have to commission an environmental impact 
report to evaluate how Broome Ranch might fare with the sudden influx of 142 
horses, hay carts, a chuck wagon and a portable country-Western dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
 That prospect daunted Mayor Alex Fiore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do we have to go through something as idiotic as an (environmental analysis) 
just to put animals on open space?" Fiore asked incredulously. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do," Towne replied. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, he said, Broome Ranch might harbor sensitive biological or 
archeological resources that could be damaged by an equestrian facility. "There 
are several issues that need to be resolved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For local equestrians, the resolution can't come fast enough. Ever since they 
learned of plans to build housing on Two Winds, equestrians have been in limbo, 
unable to plan traditional summer events such as "Line Dancing Under the Stars" 
-- and, more importantly, unable to find new stables. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark College recently closed its equestrian center, and the Seventh-day 
Adventist Church plans to shut down its stables soon. Aside from private back 
yards, the only other stables are at Cal Lutheran University, which boards only 
about a dozen horses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "As equestrians, we've been a political football," said Jeff Alexander, the 
owner of a feed store on Thousand Oaks Boulevard. "We'd like to get out of that 
position, because footballs have a way of being bounced around." 
</P>
<P>
 While city officials work to temporarily relocate Two Winds, the developer who 
will be displacing the stables is seeking a permanent solution. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its development agreement with the city, Operating Engineers, the 
developer of the Two Winds portion of the project, must provide a new site for 
the soon-to-be-demolished equestrian center. The developer has already 
identified a 7.3-acre site, but city officials and equestrians say the stables 
need more room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't say 'final resting place,' but we need to find a final location for 
the equestrian center," Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Winds manager Spencer wholeheartedly agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just to have a piece of ground we can call home," he said. "As far as the 
equestrian community is concerned, that would be real good."

GROUP FORMS TO LOBBY FOR VICTIMS OF EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A newly formed coalition of quake-battered San Fernando Valley residents and 
business owners plans to take on insurance companies, lenders and others it 
believes continue to mistreat victims of January's Northridge temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit group is calling itself Citizens Against Unfair Treatment by 
Insurance and Mortgage Companies (CAUTIM). 
</P>
<P>
 Board members include 16 representatives of area property owner associations 
and business organizations, said Sandy Miller, CAUTIM chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Collectively, they probably represent a good 40,000 to 50,000 people who have 
problems related to the earthquake involving insurance companies and lenders," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition is also made up of representatives of other consumer groups that 
have been active in the nearly six months since the quake. They include United 
Policyholders, an Oakland-based nonprofit organization, and a new local group, 
Community Assistance Recovery (CARe), based in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, an Encino resident, is also chief of staff for Sen. David A. Roberti 
(D-Van Nuys). Miller stressed that Roberti is not connected with the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the new consumer coalition are particularly angry at insurers that 
are issuing settlement checks payable to both policyholders and to their 
lenders. Some lenders are putting all or part of the money in escrow until 
repairs are made. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had this particular problem myself," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. and a CAUTIM 
organizer, said the group plans to file a lawsuit against insurers and lenders 
to recover an unspecified amount of damages by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Many quake victims have complained about the controversial practice of issuing 
dual-payee checks. They contend that lenders have no right to control the money 
if they didn't require borrowers to carry earthquake coverage.

THIS WAY IS OK FOR POOH; CLIPPERS: RICHARDSON IS GLAD TO BE BACK IN LOS ANGELES 
AFTER BEING OBTAINED IN TRADE THAT SENDS JACKSON TO PACERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When guard Pooh Richardson left UCLA in 1989, he hoped he could remain with an 
L.A. team for his NBA career. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Richardson went to the expansion Minnesota Timberwolves as the 10th 
player selected in the draft. They traded him to Indiana in September of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson finally got his wish on Thursday, when the Pacers traded him to the 
Clippers, along with forward Malik Sealy and the rights to guard-forward Eric 
Piatkowski of Nebraska, for disgruntled guard Mark Jackson and the rights to 
Louisville guard Greg Minor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to be back, and I'm happy for Malik because I think we have a great 
opportunity to start something new and let everyone know that we're going in a 
different direction, and the direction is to be successful," Richardson said. 
"I figured I'd end up here, but I took the long route." 
</P>
<P>
 The trade was worked out during Wednesday's NBA draft but couldn't be 
completed then because of NBA salary-cap rules. Richardson signed an 
$18.2-million, seven-year contract extension on draft day last year and under 
NBA rules a player cannot be combined in a trade until one year after an 
extension because of aggregate salary cap rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal might have made free-agent forward Dominique Wilkins expendable. The 
Clippers now have a surplus of small forwards, considering the acquisition of 
California forward Lamond Murray, the seventh player selected in the draft, 
Sealy and Piatkowski. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clipper General Manager Elgin Baylor would not say whether the club 
intended to re-sign Wilkins and free-agent guard Ron Harper, he said the club 
would explore the free-agent market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tomorrow will be the first opportunity to go after free agents and by 
bringing in the players in the draft and Pooh and Malik and other things we 
intend to do, it gives us more options to look at alternatives," Baylor said. 
"Outside from our free agents, there's some talent out there in the free-agent 
market and we intend to explore that." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson and Sealy, who were left off the Pacers' playoff roster last spring 
by Coach Larry Brown, hope to get fresh starts with the Clippers, who are 
rebuilding after finishing last in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "Me and Larry got along," Richardson said. "We had problems because you know 
how Larry is, but it was never a thing where I hated him. At the end of the 
season, he said that me and Malik didn't get a good deal with the Pacers as far 
as playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They handled it professionally. They asked me what I wanted to do and I said, 
'That's a question you shouldn't have asked me' and I said, 'L.A., that's where 
I want to be.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Sealy joked about his relationship with Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a love-hate relationship," he said. "We loved to hate each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a pretty good relationship. . . . Just some unfortunate circumstances 
occurred and I wasn't able to play as much as I would have liked to have 
played. But now I'm in a better situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated when the Clippers missed the playoffs for the first time in three 
years, Jackson said he didn't want to return because he wanted to play for a 
contending team. 
</P>
<P>
 Baylor maintains that Jackson didn't request a trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "He mentioned at times that he wasn't totally satisfied with the way the 
season went," Baylor said. "But this move had nothing to do with whether a 
player was happy or unhappy, it was based on the fact that we felt it was an 
excellent opportunity for us." Changing the Point 
</P>
<P>
 Guards Mark Jackson (left) and Pooh Richardson were the principals in the 
five-player trade completed Wednesday between the Clippers and Indiana Pacers.

MIKE DOWNEY: WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; BAD MEDICINE FOR THE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All I really know is that if Diego Maradona had a cold, he should have taken 
two Alka-Seltzer tablets and a Jacuzzi. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the most famous soccer player in the world ingested something 
called ephedrine in whichever nasal sprays he dribbled and headed up his sinus 
passages, he has been expelled from the most famous soccer tournament in the 
world. An artist at Time magazine is probably working overtime even as we speak 
to darken the beard on Diego's face. 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona is done. 
</P>
<P>
 He knew he had to keep his nose clean, and he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The good people of Argentina have been stricken with Ephedrine Headache No. 
1994. Maradona is homeward bound. He is on the red-eye to Buenos Aires. Buenas 
noches.  
</P>
<P>
 "He is a human being and he made a mistake," a sympathetic Bora Milutinovic, 
the U.S. coach, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but the Argentine soccer federation was not wrong to boot this soccer 
player from this tournament. A one-game suspension would have been insufficient 
for someone who should have known better than to disobey the clearly stated 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 This might not be more cruel than whacking a graffiti artist with a cane, but 
Maradona is disgraced and Argentina is distressed, and why? Because Diego had a 
cold. Because Diego took some over-the-counter medicina. Because Diego didn't 
read the label. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, if he did, he didn't care. Diego knew the rules. Diego broke the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 And who suffers? 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer suffers. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup XV was going along splendidly, with barely a ripple of disturbance. 
Some of Mexico's fans got into a clash with police. One player from Germany 
made an unfriendly gesture with his hands. But that was about it. The 
tournament was thriving, picking up speed. Maradona, the game's "marquee 
player," as we say here in Hollywood, was in sound condition, in top form and 
in good spirits, as evidenced by his devil-may-care, Pamplona-like run toward a 
TV camera after an opening-game goal. 
</P>
<P>
 It made many people happy to see Maradona that happy. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the star of the show. No active player in soccer has a name so familiar 
to even the know-nothings of the world. His presence gave the World Cup an 
added luster. And while I do not condone creating a double-standard for 
superstars who fail to follow the rules same as everybody else, may I please 
take a moment to say that these are some pretty strict rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Tab Ramos, the sensible young midfielder from the U.S. team who is originally 
from Uruguay, shook his head after Thursday's practice and said, "At this 
point, I'm with the player all the way. A lifetime ban, or whatever this 
amounts to, for an over-the-counter drug is much, much too harsh. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could happen to any of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to a can of an energy-restoring beverage by his side, Ramos said, 
"Look, somebody could come by right now and slip something into my drink and 
I'd never know. Or here's something else: I wear contacts. I put these eye 
drops in my eyes every day. But I didn't remember to ask the trainer if 
something in my drops might be illegal. They could test my eye drops if they 
wanted to. Ernie Stewart wears contacts too. Same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point we don't know if what Maradona did was intentional. Until we 
do, I feel I've got to stand by the player." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, evidently we do know. Whatever it was Maradona took for medicinal 
purposes, he apparently took a lot of it. Enough to cure five colds. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is another big difference. 
</P>
<P>
 He knew better. 
</P>
<P>
 This is no innocent lamb. Maradona once tested positive for cocaine. Another 
time he got busted for possession and distribution. His behavior has not been 
squeaky clean. More than any other player, he was someone who could take no 
unnecessary chances during this World Cup because his reputation was at stake 
and perhaps his legacy as well. Diego Armando Maradona is one of Argentina's 
greatest heroes. He is also that country's Ben Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 He should have asked. He should have checked and double-checked. Maradona has 
been around. He has been to several World Cups. He knew how to ask which 
medications he could take. He could inquire in any language and someone would 
find him an interpreter. Someone would provide him with a chart of illegal 
stimulants. Diego had a cold? "Quiero aspirinas -- I want aspirin." Diego's 
nose was clogged? "Quiero inhalante." All he had to do was ask. And never take 
anything unless you're sure, unless you are absolutely, positively, 100% sure. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you aren't sure? 
</P>
<P>
 Just say no.

U.S. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL; ST. LOUIS HAS TAKEN TO THIS EVENT IN A BIG WAY 
</P>

<P>
 It's not the heat, it's the humility. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis has endured some sports scars in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a city where the football team left, basketball teams won't come, 
hockey's ice has melted and the baseball team is so-so. 
</P>
<P>
 And it didn't get the World Cup.  
</P>
<P>
 But this is a resilient city that dried itself from last year's floods. 
</P>
<P>
 So, against the backdrop of an arch that is less familiar to some of today's 
youth than the Golden Arches, the 1994 U.S. Olympic Festival gets under way 
today with the opening ceremony and the Olympic Festival torch. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is an event dedicated to developing United States athletes, most of the 
participants are not well known. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Joyner-Kersee is expected to run in in the 100-meter hurdles Thursday 
night and Michelle Kwan will give a figure skating exhibition Saturday, but the 
attraction here is rising stars.  
</P>
<P>
 It's like a mini-Olympics. It's 37 sports in 10 days. An Olympics for 
Americans, if you will. 
</P>
<P>
 Or call it an Olympic warm-up, which should be easy given temperatures in the 
high 90s and similar humidity. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Olympic events, there will competition in table tennis, 
bowling, roller skating and roller hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 33,000 tickets were sold for the Olympic Festival in the first two 
days. Officials say ticket sales have surpassed $2.1 million and they are 
anticipating sellouts for all the track days and various other events.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; U.S. DISMAYED BY MARADONA'S LATEST FALL; 
REACTION: NATIONAL TEAM MEMBERS PREFER TO REMEMBER SUSPENDED ARGENTINE 
SUPERSTAR FOR HIS DEEDS ON THE FIELD. 
</P>

<P>
 The question for Claudio Reyna and hundreds of thousands of fans around the 
world: Is it time to take down the posters of Diego Maradona? 
</P>
<P>
 Reyna, the U.S. midfielder whose parents are from Argentina, grew up with 
posters of Maradona and the Argentine national team in his room. He admired 
Maradona the player but said he never had illusions about Maradona the man. 
Wednesday's revelation that the Argentine team captain had tested positive for 
ephedrine, a banned substance, did not change Reyna's view. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a player I have always looked up to on the field," Reyna said Thursday. 
"On the field, not off. You see it in this country -- there are athletes who 
have problems. I've always idolized him on the field. I don't know him, I can't 
judge him. On the field is how I judge him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked and disappointed and kind of left wondering why he took the 
banned substance. Whether it came from his doctor or the federation, we'll 
never know. It's a huge mistake on someone's part. It was foolish." 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction at the U.S. training camp to Maradona's expulsion from the tournament 
was varied, but no one was pleased with the news. 
</P>

 U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic, who coached briefly in the Argentine professional 
league, said he felt sorry for Maradona's family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know him well," Milutinovic said. "He's a great example of what it means to 
be a soccer player. It's sad that such a great legend may finish (his career) 
the way he has now. I feel sorry for him as a human being. We should take a 
moment to think about what's going on and to think about what's important in 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a human being who made a mistake, and I think people need to remember 
that. He's given a lot to the world of soccer. He's done so much for soccer in 
Argentina and for the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Reyna too considered Maradona's legacy and how this week's events might affect 
the way in which the superstar would be remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to be remembered for leading Argentina, of course. But not in the 
same fashion that Pele went out," Reyna said. "Twenty years down the road, he's 
not going to be remembered like Pele. He had a beautiful story until (a 
previous) cocaine bust. It ruined his storybook life." 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely has Maradona's turbulent life been described as storybook, but his 
abilities on the field are themselves a textbook for aspiring soccer players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he's a fallen hero, by any means," Reyna said, speaking to a 
group of reporters. "He just made a mistake that a person like him can't make. 
In this country, they are going to harp on it a lot in the media, like you guys 
are right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Said forward Roy Wegerle: "I guess it dents the sport in some respect. There's 
always someone willing to try something. It's a pity it's him. He's the most 
popular soccer player in the world. It's something the World Cup could have 
done without." 
</P>
<P>
 Some players cringed when asked what Maradona's absence would mean to the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "He means so much to the game," defender Alexi Lalas said. "This World Cup has 
been sensational, on and off the field. The World Cup will continue to go on. 
It'll just be without Maradona."

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; ROMANIANS NOW AT LIBERTY TO BE 
FREEWHEELING; SOCCER: WITH PASSING OF CEAUSESCU DICTATORSHIP, NATIONAL TEAM AND 
AN IRASCIBLE PRESS HAVE ROOM TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The English-speaking reporters put the caps back on their pens and heaved a 
sigh. Oh, boy. Here we go . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Two Romanian reporters and the Romanian team's coach, Anghel Iordanescu, were 
arguing at a dead sprint during a news conference the other day and the 
translator had given up. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the wild, Western world of soccer media, where with a deep baritone 
and a credential you too can take a cheap shot at a superstar. 
</P>
<P>
 But these are the Romanians, and for them a free press is all very new and 
exciting -- for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens when we have no access to media?" asked Gheorghe Hagi, the 
team's superstar. "We get more respect with the media (attention). If we had a 
great performance, it could not be observed earlier (before 1989). You need 
advertising and press." 
</P>
<P>
 And both sides remember when the rules were different. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before," Hagi added with a slight laugh, "that was against the government's 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 When Romania competed in the 1990 World Cup, it was with the sound of gunshots 
still vivid in memory. The brief and bloody civil war in which communist 
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was overthrown had ended only six months before the 
tournament in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceausescu had been the backbone of Romanian soccer, lavishing gifts and 
privileges on players, sponsoring teams, even fixing games. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 team was the last soccer tie to his regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, the Romanian team is the first world-class product of this 
newly free nation, and the players compete not for a dictator's pleasure but 
for a people's pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Snarling reporters are the voice of that pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football has grown up a lot," Hagi said. "All of Romania has grown up a lot. 
Romania is trying to reach the level of the rest of Europe. The (soccer) 
federation and the country are trying to change and trying to remember 
something good." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Iordanescu: "Before in the old system, our players had a lot of talent 
but they did not have opportunity to cultivate their image as players. Once the 
political system changed, players were able to travel beyond the borders of our 
country. What (the current success) represents is a change in the mentality of 
our players. They are developing a foreign mentality." 
</P>
<P>
 And scaring foreign teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Considered filler to Group A's Colombia, Switzerland and host-novelty United 
States, the Romanians whipped the Colombians, 3-1, and topped the United 
States, 1-0, for the group championship. 
</P>
<P>
 And the game against the Swiss? After being routed, 4-1, the Romanians showed 
a flare for the very Western art of spin control, blaming the media. 
</P>
<P>
 At the news conference, Mircea Angelescu, Romanian soccer federation vice 
president, said, "We have been honest with the media. We have not told you a 
player is injured and then you see that player on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 The Swiss had announced before the game that three players would be out with 
injuries. Each of the three scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Near tears, Angelescu declared, "We are being honest and would be happy with 
some credit." 
</P>
<P>
 Before a scribbling press, the players talked easily and confidently of moving 
into the semifinals, two games distant. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if he would rather face Italy's Roberto Baggio or Bulgaria's Hristo 
Stoichkov in the next round, Hagi said he would like to play both. 
</P>
<P>
 And of the victory over Colombia, Angelescu said, "We blew one of the biggest 
colored balloons in the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt about it -- the once-stoic Romanians are taking on a media image not 
far from cocky. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good for ourselves; it's good for our country," Hagi said. "And now 
we're going further. As an athlete you want to go further, but success means 
happiness and success means peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Teams that always have a howling press to contend with call it "pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Not Iordanescu. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a great pleasure for us to know we're giving (home fans) something very 
happy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said goalkeeper Florin Prunea, who shut out the United States: "In Romania, 
soccer is the most popular sport and our advancing puts our country's name in 
good standing." 
</P>
<P>
 Right, said Iordanescu. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our country is in transition," he added. "I'm not political, I belong to 
sports. But back home we have very big difficulties which now are easier 
because of our boys," and turning, he pointed to where his players had been 
seated, "because they brought satisfaction through sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Put that in your notebook.

 Sandy Zubrin of Newport Beach will defend her title in the Southern California 
Diving Invitational, beginning today at the Marguerite Swimming and Diving 
Complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Zubrin, 17, a senior at Corona del Mar High who was this year's Division II 
Southern Section diving champion, is a heavy favorite to repeat her victory in 
the women's one- and three-meter diving and platform overall competition.Zubrin 
recently returned from competition in China, where she was third in platform at 
the Four Nations Meet in Tianjin, and 11th in the platform at the China Open. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Zubrin, local favorites Summer Brown, Tyce Routson and 
12-year-old Erica Sorgi, who set four meet records last year, also will compete 
with more than 300 divers in the four-day meet. The Southern California Diving 
Invitational is the last important meet before the U.S. world team trials, July 
14 in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition begins at 9 a.m. with one- and three-meter diving. Senior 
competition starts at 9 a.m. Sunday. ERIK HAMILTON

MIKE PENNER: CUP RUNNETH OVER THE BOYS OF SUMMER IN NUMEROUS WAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The international and national pastimes are going head to head on the same 
soil for the first time, and, in an upset, the national pastime is getting 
kicked around a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 According to numbers released by ESPN this week, its broadcast of the United 
States-Colombia World Cup match drew a rating of 4.5 -- better than twice the 
1.9 share it has been averaging for its prime time baseball telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 How is this possible, you ask? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, I can think of two or three or 30 reasons. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 1. Soccer has Alexi Lalas, the wild-maned, orange-goateed, rock 
guitar-playing, cherry Slurpee-swilling, head-banging United States defender 
who is given to such off-kilter observations as, "We need the culture police in 
the stands, saying, 'Hey, it's culture, leave it alone.' So what if they're 
sacrificing a goat, let it go. It's the World Cup." Baseball has Tom Lawless. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Soccer players are paid huge sums of money for their unparalleled skill, 
agility, stamina, leg strength and mid-air acrobatics. Baseball players are 
paid huge sums of money. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Soccer players run virtually non-stop for 90 minutes amid searing on-field 
temperatures that sometimes reach 120 degrees. Baseball players beat out an 
infield grounder and complain that there's no beer in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 4. With two 45-minute halves, a 15-minute intermission and two to five minutes 
of "injury time," most soccer games clock in under two hours. After two hours, 
most baseball games aren't out of the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Soccer players play the ball off their shins, thighs, ankles, knees, 
chests, hips, shoulders and heads. When he plays left field for the Phillies, 
so does Pete Incaviglia. 
</P>
<P>
 6. After soccer games, fans light fireworks and throw them in the air. After 
baseball games, players light fireworks and throw them at the fans. 
</P>
<P>
 7. When someone scores a goal on a Univision World Cup telecast, Andres Cantor 
notes the event with a frenzied, passionate, up-from-the-diaphragm exhortation 
of "GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!" Baseball hasn't heard anything like it since "The 
Giants win the pennant!" and that was 43 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 8. No on-base percentage, slugging percentage, total average, total bases, 
quality starts, at-bats-per-home run ratio, at- bats- per- bench- clearing- 
brawl ratio and national- anthem- sung- on- artificial- turf- with- the- wind- 
blowing- out efficiency in soccer. Just goals. 
</P>
<P>
 9. That bicycle kick Marcelo Balboa almost put in against Colombia? Let's see 
Kent Hrbek try it. 
</P>
<P>
 10. In Wednesday's sports action, the Oakland Athletics defeated the 
California Angels, 1-0, and the Netherlands defeated Morocco, 2-1. Too many 1-0 
games in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 11. Marge Schott doesn't own a soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
 12. Under baseball's drug-abuse policy, Diego Maradona would have six more 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
 13. No Bebeto trading cards on the Home Shopping Network. 
</P>
<P>
 14. A Russian scoring five goals in a World Cup match against Cameroon is like 
Rex Hudler hitting five grand slams in Game 3 of the World Series. The 
difference is that in soccer, these things do happen. 
</P>
<P>
 15. A corner kick in soccer is a suspenseful and exciting event, often 
resulting in the ball being headed toward the net in an impossible angle and 
the goalkeeper leaping out of his socks to try to thwart it. A corner kick in 
baseball means Dean Palmer has booted another one. 
</P>
<P>
 16. In soccer's "Group of Death," Italy, Ireland, Mexico and Norway all 
finished with .500 records. In baseball's "Group of Death," the Rangers, 
Mariners, A's and Angels should be so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 17. When soccer players grab their crotches in public -- bracing for a free 
kick that will send the ball screaming toward their midsections at 90 to 100 
miles per hour -- they do so for a very good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 18. George Will doesn't write about soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 19. Tony Meola, smart Jersey kid, was drafted by the New York Yankees, but 
decided he'd rather play for the World Cup Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 20. In soccer, Bora is a coach. In baseball, Bora is an often-used descriptive 
term for the game in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 21. One-named soccer players such as Romario and Bebeto have an almost 
mystical, mythical air about them. If baseball tried the same thing, we'd be 
left with Chuck, Hal, Phil, George and Fred. 
</P>
<P>
 22. No rotisserie soccer leagues. Yet. 
</P>
<P>
 23. Group play in the World Cup -- where four teams play for two weeks to 
eliminate the weak sisters before moving onto the second round -- is a great 
idea baseball should adopt. If baseball had group play, the Angels would be in 
Trinidad today, trying to qualify for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 24. International soccer writers have the right idea: Don't bother with 
postgame quotes, just rip away from atop the ivory tower. American baseball 
writers, meanwhile, waste the best years of their adult lives waiting alongside 
rank locker stalls so they fill their game reports with such pithy observations 
as "I was just looking for something to hit" and "I been throwing a whole lot 
better since Marcel changed my arm angle." 
</P>
<P>
 25. In soccer, the Old Boys Club is a professional team in Argentina. In 
baseball, it's the managerial pool. 
</P>
<P>
 26. In soccer, players can't handle the ball with their hands. In baseball, 
neither can Jose Offerman. 
</P>
<P>
 27. At a Netherlands World Cup game, you can hear the fans humming the 
triumphal march of "Aida." At an Ireland World Cup game, you can hear the fans 
belting out the timeless standard "Molly Malone." At a Minnesota Twins game, 
you can hear the fans singing along to John Denver's "Thank God I'm A Country 
Boy." 
</P>
<P>
 28. Soccer uniforms are cooler than baseball uniforms. That 
traffic-pylon-in-a-paint-fight number worn by Mexican goalie Jorge Campos has 
the Houston Astros eating their hearts out. 
</P>
<P>
 29. No one in baseball can tailgate like the Brazilians. 
</P>
<P>
 30. In soccer and baseball, strikers are expected to dominate the headlines 
this summer. Only in soccer, this is considered a good thing.

MAKING A STEADY SPLASH; NEELY GETS RESULTS, NOT FAME, WITH HIS CONSISTENT PLAY 
ON DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Doug Neely threw back his head and laughed at the thought. The subject was his 
anonymity in a sport rife with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The sport? Indoor soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Neely? A defender, a three-time all-star for the Splash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not into it for the recognition or the fame," said Neely, who knows his 
life would be pretty frustrating if those were his motives. "I just love 
playing the game. I have a good time when I put on the uniform, when I get on 
the field. The whole atmosphere -- I love it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Never in his wildest fantasies at Canyon High did Neely think he could make a 
living playing soccer. Nor when he played two years at San Diego State. Nor 
during his two years at Chapman. Not until a year later, after his first season 
with the Los Angeles Lazers and he was on one of his now annual surfing trips 
with friends, did it hit him. 
</P>
<P>
 It was then, he realized, "what a pretty good job I have." 
</P>
<P>
 Neely has fashioned a pretty good career for himself in the indoor game since 
he graduated from Canyon in 1983 and was The Times Orange County player of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 He was nicknamed "Twitchel" back then for his unorthodox dribbling. Even 
today, coaches and players say the unpredictable way he handles the ball is an 
asset. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I don't know what he's going to do," Coach George Fernandez says, "the 
opponents don't know what he's going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 "You should watch him dance," said teammate Rod Castro. "You could write 
volumes." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so Neely gets in his own zone on the dance floor. But on the field, he 
gets in his own zone, too. He has been one of the Splash's most consistent 
performers. In seven games to date, Neely leads the league in power-play goals 
with seven and the team in blocked shots (12). 
</P>
<P>
 "Doug is the type of player you really don't notice," Fernandez said. "He's so 
consistent; he's not flashy. He does his job day in and day out, and you 
consider that a true professional. He has fun on and off the field. He's a 
happy person who loves life, and it shows on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of the most consistent players we've had this season." 
</P>
<P>
 Neely, 29, bounces to his own beat. His hair -- recently cut short -- once 
crept eight inches down his back, but he said it wasn't symbolic of his 
carefree attitude or beach lifestyle that takes him on summer trips to 
Indonesia, Baja or Costa Rica with some of his oldest, closest friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just decided to let it go," he said. "There's no story with the hair. 
People try to read into that too much and it has nothing to do with 
personality. That's just how I liked wearing my hair. People are so shallow 
when they think that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Fernandez, who played against the wild-maned Neely before coaching him 
this season: "He cut it and now he looks like a little kid." 
</P>
<P>
 But those who know Neely say there is a lot of little kid in him. He is 
upbeat, optimistic, fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's so nice," is a common perception by those who meet him at the Splash's 
postgame gatherings at a local restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope people like me when they're around me, that they feel comfortable," 
Neely said. "I hope people are glad that I'm there and that I bring a good 
feeling to people." 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Nice Guy can be pretty tough when he needs to, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro has seen Neely on and off the field, and played alongside and against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very aggressive and never quits on the ball," Castro said. "He's 
extremely intense. When he's on the field, you know he's giving 100%. There's 
that double personality. It's a very different type of intensity -- a subdued 
intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoyed playing against him because I knew we would have a good battle 
together. And I knew he wasn't a dirty player. I didn't have to worry about 
that. It was a clean game and a fair game against him." 
</P>
<P>
 Neely calls it a controlled aggression, and it helped him become an all-star 
in Baltimore with the Blast of the Major Soccer League and the last two years 
with the Spirit of the National Professional Soccer League. He played last year 
for the L.A. United. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez said Neely has come into his own the last two years, and that has 
helped him dictate the flow of a game instead of simply reacting to an opposing 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
 He has dictated an all-star type year this season, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The subject? Fame and fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish the arena was filled every night, but I know that's not going to 
happen," said Neely, who was born in Garden Grove and lives in Newport Beach. 
"But we're the building blocks for the future. If you listen to the fans that 
we get, they're into it. And you feed off that. But once the game's over, I 
don't take it home with me. I just go on with my life and enjoy it. I love the 
game for what it is -- just a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like I'm making any big money, but I'm happy."

Management is headed by former NFL figures Don Klosterman and Eddie LeBaron. 
</P>
<P>
 The casino will be open 24 hours a day, with tables for various card games, 
restaurants, a health club, stores, a sports lounge, betting windows and 
television monitors so the races can be seen. BOB MIESZERSKI

AN OLYMPIAN EFFORT; JORDAN STICKS WITH SOFTBALL THROUGH PLEASURE AND PAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are times, usually when the air is dry and frigid, when Barbara Jordan 
feels much older than her 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Her right knee stiffens and a dull pain emanates from deep beneath her teeth, 
numbing the right side of her jaw. 
</P>
<P>
 During these moments, Jordan considers the enormity of her sacrifice and 
wonders if the effort is worth . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Time out. 
</P>
<P>
 Take that back. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth be told, Jordan never, ever ponders her fate or questions her devotion. 
Others might second-guess, but she does not afford herself the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 She is too busy chasing the carrot. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan wants to play on America's first Olympic softball team. Heaven help 
anyone who stands in her way. Other players have made the 1996 Games in Atlanta 
a goal. 
</P>
<P>
 For Jordan, it is an obsession. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would rather die than not make the Olympic team," she says earnestly. "It 
means everything to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Failing to make the squad is an option Jordan has never paused to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't allow myself to think that way," the former Cal State Northridge 
All-American said. "I can't even picture it." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because her confidence is so high. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, Jordan will play center field for the East team in first-round 
action of the Olympic Festival in St. Louis. At the end of the competition, a 
team of 16 players will be selected to represent the United States at the World 
Games in Newfoundland later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan already has made arrangements to take two months off from her job as a 
private investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 "You say softball and my stomach just goes, " Jordan said. "It's all I talk 
about. It's my life." 
</P>
<P>
 None of this should come as a surprise to those who remember Jordan as the 
fiery catalyst of Northridge's NCAA Division II championship teams in 1984, '85 
and '87. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, she played the game with such ferocity that her own coach, Gary 
Torgeson, referred to her as "gnarly." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, the leadoff batter, often steamrolled down the line with enough force 
to spin the first baseman around. Whether the play was close didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 She also made a habit of arguing with umpires, staring down opponents and 
generally making a scene. Once, during a lull in a playoff game, Jordan chose 
to jolt a group of apathetic fans by taking a bat to a chain-link fence behind 
home plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that the game was in Sacramento. Jordan now laughs at such antics. 
They are a thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not the same player I was in college," she said, "or the same person." 
</P>
<P>
 So much has happened. So much has changed. Twice she had knee surgery. 
Permanent wires help hold her jaw in place -- the vestige of a beaning. 
</P>
<P>
 Mended parts; a recovering heart. Not all scars are external. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan still was enrolled at Northridge in November of 1988 when her older 
sister was murdered.  
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Jordan was a person who cared. She frequently sent encouraging notes 
to Barbara, wishing her little sister well. Beverly was slain by her fiance. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was the one person in my family who understood what (softball) meant to 
me," Jordan said. "After she died, I lost some of the fire. I had a hole in my 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a long time before I could say I was Barbara Jordan again." 
</P>
<P>
 But she can say it now, and mean it. She believes that her sister, in some 
way, shape or form, is close to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before nationals, or when we had tryouts (for the national team) in 
September, I had dreams about her at night," Jordan said. "That lets me know 
she's still with me and watching out for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan certainly would keep a guardian angel busy. In 1989, just as she was 
nearing completion of tests she hoped would lead to a career in law 
enforcement, she seriously injured her knee while clowning with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Her anterior cruciate ligament was completely severed, cartilage was damaged 
and a piece of bone was chipped. So much for being a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 After two months of physical therapy, Jordan needed arthroscopic surgery to 
remove adhesions that kept her knee from bending properly. By the summer of 
1991 she was playing in the Olympic Festival in Los Angeles -- much to the 
surprise and distress of her family. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Jordan hasn't seen her daughter play since 1987 and has her reasons for 
staying away. Her concern is genuine and well-founded. Mom was there in 1992, 
nursing daughter back to health after her most serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing for the Redding, Calif., Rebels against the Raybestos Brakettes in the 
national amateur championship game, the left-handed-hitting Jordan was struck 
in the face by a rising 70 m.p.h. fastball that broke her jaw in two places. 
</P>
<P>
 At one place in her jaw, the bone was cracked so severely it was forced up 
through her gum line. The next morning, her pillow was soaked with blood. 
</P>
<P>
 During surgery, doctors inserted permanent wires in Jordan's chin to help hold 
her jaw together. 
</P>
<P>
 Cinderella, she wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked like a pumpkin," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later, Jordan walked into a bank in Calabasas. There, one of the 
tellers, an old friend, greeted her. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, your mother just hopes you never play softball again," the woman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she added, "But I know you will. And deep down, your mother does, too." 
</P>
<P>
 But for the first time, Jordan wasn't sure she wanted to play. She wondered 
how she would react to the next inside pitch. Would she bail out? 
</P>
<P>
 By the spring of '93, Jordan knew the answer. One day she sat down with her 
father, Elmer, showed him the Olympic Festival tryout application and explained 
the process of making the Festival team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad, I think I should do it," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father had one question. "Can you taste it?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad, my mouth waters when I talk about it," Jordan replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Mom wasn't shocked, nor particularly pleased. In the end, Gloria Jordan said 
she respected her daughter's decision, even if she didn't agree with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "How could she not worry about me getting hurt?" Jordan said. "She's my 
mother. . . . She felt the pain I was going through." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan has rebounded from the beaning with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that the person who works the hardest is going to make it," Jordan 
said. "That's what drives me." 
</P>
<P>
 Drives is an understatement. Jordan commutes from her home in Huntington Beach 
to a private investigation firm in Burbank each morning, then drives back to 
Orange County in the afternoon to work out at a gymnasium, running track or 
softball field. 
</P>
<P>
 Even her closest work supervisor has little idea of Jordan's talent or her 
insatiable desire to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 What the supervisor did know was that, before last spring, Jordan's team 
always placed high at the national amateur tournament -- but had never won it. 
So, as Jordan left the office on her last day before the tournament, her boss 
wished her well, saying, "Good luck. Always a bridesmaid, never a bride." 
</P>
<P>
 Turning slowly, almost painfully, Jordan replied, "Don't even say that to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Jordan: "The people I work with are totally oblivious." 
</P>
<P>
 Top-flight softball is every bit as competitive as pennant-race baseball. 
Consider the scene in Stratford, Conn., last summer when the home team, the 
Brakettes, was defending its national amateur title against Jordan and the 
Redding Rebels before 5,000 obnoxious fans: 
</P>
<P>
 "They were calling us everything from whores to hookers," Jordan said. "They 
were brutal." 
</P>
<P>
 And personal. In Jordan's first at-bat, she got a chilling reminder from some 
Brakette fans. "Turn the other cheek, Jordan!" one screamed. "Hit her on the 
other side of the face this year!" yelled another. 
</P>
<P>
 Redding, by winning a 28-inning marathon and fighting its way through the 
losers' bracket, still faced the daunting task of defeating the Brakettes twice 
to win the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rebels won the first game, 3-0. Then, just before the second game, a 
Redding player asked which pitcher would be going for the Brakettes in the 
final. Cheri Kempf, came the reply. 
</P>
<P>
 The name sent a chill down Jordan's spine. It was Kempf who had beaned her the 
year before. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brakettes took a 2-0 advantage into the middle innings when Jordan came up 
for her second at-bat with two out and a runner on second. 
</P>
<P>
 Kempf's first pitch struck Jordan squarely in the back, and both benches 
cleared. Jordan didn't charge Kempf. But, in a rage, Jordan did direct a flurry 
of choice words toward the pitcher while trotting to first base. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what turned it," said Roger Dawes, Redding's manager. "When Kempf hit 
Barb again, the whole team was just livid." 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the next inning, Redding had tied the score. In the bottom of 
the seventh, the Rebels won it, 3-2, with Jordan contributing a key sacrifice 
bunt. 
</P>
<P>
 A few Redding players came up to Jordan afterward and said the team won it for 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won for all of us," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan also won over Dawes, who was slow to convert. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I didn't like her personally, I knew in my heart Barbara was the type 
of player I needed to win a national championship," Dawes said. "To tell you 
the truth, I didn't even like her much the first couple of years I had her 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 The player he once considered rude and insecure has developed into one of his 
best friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Behind the rough exterior, she is a warm, sensitive person," Dawes said. "The 
kid is a champion, and she'll belly up. I've often told her that if I was in a 
bar fight I'd want her on my side." 
</P>
<P>
 At 5-foot-6, 130 pounds, Jordan is small by softball standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Dawes calls Jordan "the best outfielder in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Will she be held in similar esteem two years from now? An eight-member 
committee will be evaluating players competing at the Olympic Festival, the 
national tournament and all next year before picking the Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 Other young and talented players are developing daily. Sometimes they are 
compared to "a young Jordan." Jordan watches and does not worry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I killed myself to be good enough to get this far," she said. "You tell me 
who I have to beat out and I'll kick her (butt). I'm not going to lose. I know 
what I feel and it burns right through my stomach and down to my toes." 
</P>
<P>
 Dawes said he'd want Jordan on his team even if she wasn't among the 
most-talented players. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get into big battles, you want people there who are unafraid, 
somebody who's gonna do whatever it takes," Dawes said. "Barbara is one of 
those players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the original."

BRISON AGAIN BACK AT GROUND ZERO; FOOTBALL: WELL-TRAVELED PLAYER COMES FULL 
CIRCLE, LANDING IN WESTLAKE VILLAGE WHERE HIS CAREER FIRST STARTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF WONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's no secret that Brian Brison hasn't had the best luck over the last few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The start of his athletic career began with a fizzle instead of a bang when he 
was declared academically ineligible by the Southern Section as a freshman at 
Westlake High. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the disciplinary problems that forced him to attend five different 
schools in two states during his high school career. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the low point: The well-documented assault on Birmingham track Coach 
Scott King that led to Brison's suspension from athletic competition for one 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
 But after all that, Brison thought he finally found his niche at Ohio 
University when he enrolled there on scholarship in 1992, a place where he 
could leave his troubled past behind to concentrate on football. 
</P>
<P>
 No such luck. Almost two years and two schools later, Brison, the former 
football and track standout from San Fernando High, is back in California and 
plans to play for Pasadena City College next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, after a series of zigzag moves that would catch the fancy of most 
any running back, Brison is back where he started. He has been reunited with 
Buzz Holcomb, the man who moved Brison into his Westlake Village home when 
Brison was in the seventh grade. Holcomb has been Brison's legal guardian since 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 For Brison, this is just another stop on a long journey that he hopes will end 
with a scholarship to an NCAA Division I university. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Brison, Ohio coaches told him that they were impressed with him 
as a freshman cornerback and reassured him that he would get playing time. When 
Saturdays came, however, the playing time did not come. 
</P>
<P>
 After Ohio finished 1-10 in 1992, Brison was moved to strong safety the 
following spring. He didn't mind, as long as he was still in the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't think I could handle the corner spot," Brison said. "I moved to 
strong safety and they said, 'It looks like you're going to be the starter.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As Ohio's 1993 season opener against North Carolina approached, Brison was 
asked to switch to outside linebacker because he defended the run effectively.  
</P>
<P>
 "All through high school I had fun no matter where I was playing," Brison 
said. "When I went to Ohio, I lost a little love for football, and that's 
another reason I felt that I needed to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be in the locker room, I would put on my pads and go, 'I don't want to 
practice today.' That's never me, especially for football." 
</P>
<P>
 At 5-foot-9, 185 pounds, Brison hardly had the ideal size to be a linebacker, 
and it showed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I don't know about you, but you can stand up and (see) he's not a 
linebacker," Holcomb said. "It doesn't take a rocket scientist." 
</P>
<P>
 So he blasted off. For Brison, home not only meant coming back to California, 
but coming back to Holcomb as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Brison six years ago was among a group of talented athletes who moved in with 
Holcomb as freshmen.  
</P>
<P>
 The group included Ontiwaun Carter, who later graduated from Kennedy and is 
now a tailback at Arizona, and Colorado State tailback Leonice Brown, who 
graduated from San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 The door remained open. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's meant a lot to me because Buzz has always helped me," Brison said. "He's 
always been there for me whenever I've needed him." 
</P>
<P>
 For Holcomb, having Brison at home has helped fill a void left after his older 
son, Mike, was killed in a car accident in 1989.  
</P>
<P>
 Holcomb also has a younger son, Erik, a sophomore split end at UCLA who 
enrolled with Brison at Westlake High during their freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
 "After Mike died, I've always kissed my boys," Holcomb said. "These guys would 
come up to me and hug me and kiss me in public and it's just a show of 
respectful affection. I love being loved by 'em and I love loving 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 Brison enrolled for the spring semester at Moorpark College after leaving Ohio 
during the holiday break. He left Moorpark after completing the semester to 
look for a football program in which he felt more comfortable. Pasadena wound 
up being the perfect choice. 
</P>
<P>
 He is lining up at tailback, where he has not played since his senior year at 
San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me to be at the tailback spot where I've never been since high school . . 
. it's getting kind of exciting for me because I know that's where I should 
be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His options are once again as wide open. Of course, playing at a junior 
college means that Brison will attend at least one more school. He hopes to be 
picked up by a Pacific 10 Conference school, for a rather unusual reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been looking forward to playing against (Erik Holcomb) for a very long 
time," Brison said. 
</P>
<P>
 If things start going Brison's way, he just might get that chance.

SUPERSONICS, WARRIORS READY TO MAKE TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Golden State Warriors would send Sarunas Marciulionis and Byron Houston to 
Seattle in return for Ricky Pierce and the SuperSonics' No. 1 pick, Carlos 
Rogers, under a pending deal between the teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade hasn't been announced or formally consummated yet because of a 
freeze on new or adjusted contracts in the NBA until at least July 8.The 
moratorium is the result of a temporary restraining order issued in U.S. 
District Court in New York in response to a Players Assn. antitrust suit 
against the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Warrior President Dan Finnane confirmed Wednesday night that "something was in 
the works" but declined to be specific. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco Examiner reported Thursday the deal would go through once 
the legal and technical aspects were resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers had also tried to make a deal for Rogers, a 6-foot-11 center.

STANDOUT SOFTBALL TRIO PLAYS HARDBALL FOR THE FIRST TIME; BASEBALL: FORMER CAL 
STATE NORTHRIDGE ALL-AMERICANS TRY THEIR HANDS AT NATIONAL PASTIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Baseball no longer is the forbidden fruit for female athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Three former Cal State Northridge All-Americans gave it their all at an open 
tryout Sunday for the Colorado Silver Bullets, the nation's only women's 
professional baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Priscilla Rouse was a member of two NCAA Division II national championship 
softball teams at CSUN. Tamara Ivie and Shannon Jones played in the NCAA 
Division I college softball World Series twice with the Matadors, who moved up 
to that level four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning has been an integral part of these athletes' careers, yet there they 
were in the sweltering Rancho Cucamonga heat striving to make a team that has a 
1-20 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy women showed up to try out for the Bullets in temperatures above 100 
degrees. They clapped loudly at the start of orientation when Manager Phil 
Niekro was introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just looking for ballplayers to invite to camp next year," said Niekro, 
a former major league knuckleball pitcher who won 318 games in 24 years. "We 
looked at 1,700 women for our ball club last year and 24 made the team. We let 
four go since that. . . . It's not going to be easy." 
</P>
<P>
 The women, dressed in everything from baseball pants and T-shirts to shorts 
and tank tops, took note and got to work. The tryout tested speed, defensive 
ability, arm strength and accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Only those who did well in at least two categories made it to the batting 
cage. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who didn't went home. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a public relations trip," said Tommy Jones, the Silver Bullets' 
director of player development. "There will be a lot of hurt emotions, but this 
is the same scenario as a major league baseball trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who runs the tryouts, played eight seasons of professional baseball and 
managed 12 years in the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can't throw, can't run, can't catch, we're not gonna pick you," he 
said. "We don't carry too many DHs." 
</P>
<P>
 Rouse, an outfielder who will play in the Olympic Sports Festival beginning 
this weekend, expected a challenge but didn't think she was out of her league. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't see a good softball player not being able to adjust to the game," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But of the 70 players trying out, only 20 made it to the end of the lengthy 
workout. Ivie, Jones and Rouse were among them. So was Sandra Romero, a 
32-year-old Ventura native who played softball at Ventura High and Ventura 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I practice baseball three hours a day with my nephew's Pony baseball team," 
said Romero, who works in construction. "I love playing ball. I grew up around 
the sport and as a little girl always wished I could play with the Dodgers." 
</P>
<P>
 Ivie and Jones are students and have no commitments that would hinder them 
should they land jobs as professional ballplayers. Romero is self-employed and 
says she could take time off. 
</P>
<P>
 Rouse, 30, is a computer software engineer and would have to take a sabbatical 
if she makes the team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Silver Bullets play men's minor league, semipro, amateur and over-30 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches wouldn't name the top candidates from Sunday's tryout, but they 
anticipate inviting about three players from Rancho Cucamonga to spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20 finalists were told they would be contacted by mail toward the end of 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 However Niekro was not impressed with what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an average tryout," he said. "A lot of people were out for the first 
time and they said, 'That's a long way to throw the ball.' We did have better 
arms than we thought we would in the bullpen, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was glad to hear that because she tried out as an infielder and pitcher. 
The 21-year-old says it was her first time throwing a baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I had nothing to lose," she said. "This is a chance of a lifetime. 
What else is there for us to play after college softball? This is great. It's 
exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 But the transition from softball may not be easy. Wooden bats are heavier than 
the aluminum ones used in softball. Baseball dimensions are also tougher to 
navigate and the ball is much smaller and travels faster. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivie says it felt strange handling a baseball. The 21-year-old played in three 
softball games with her summer league on Saturday and felt awkward fielding 
baseballs on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard to adjust," she said. "It took me four times to get the ground 
ball. I figured it would be like this, but I wanted to try out anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 The tryout was held in conjunction with the Silver Bullets' Monday game 
against the Southern California Tremors 30-and-over club. The Bullets lost, 
8-1, but scored for the first time in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3,191 fans were not concerned with the Bullets' horrible record and often 
sloppy play against the Tremors. 
</P>
<P>
 They cheered loudly when pitcher Shae Sloan threw her first strike in the 
second inning, went crazy when designated hitter Pam Schaffrath smacked a 
double in the third and jumped and yelled wildly when right fielder Michelle 
Delloso stole third base in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 These fans even cheered when the Tremors committed an error and booed every 
time a Silver Bullet pop fly was caught. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been incredible fan support," said Kathleen Christie, the team's 
director of media relations.  
</P>
<P>
 "Without an exception, in every single game the crowd is behind the women 
regardless of the score or their performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we started we wondered how the women were going to handle the 
heckling, but that hasn't happened yet. So far the other team and the umpires 
are the only ones that have had to worry about heckling." 
</P>
<P>
 The Silver Bullets, who are each paid $20,000 plus expenses for a 45-game 
season, received a standing ovation at the end of the game. Then hundreds of 
people flocked to the fence by first base and anxiously waited for players to 
sign game programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle McAnany, the only local player on the team, says it has been like a 
dream come true.  
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old physical education teacher was an All-American third baseman 
on CSUN's softball team in 1985 and a member of three Matador national title 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Former CSUN catcher Missy Cress made the Silver Bullets roster in April, but 
was one of four players cut June 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I'd play pro baseball," McAnany said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The fans are awesome. We've had a great response. Even our opponents are 
helpful. And playing in major league parks has been incredible. I've met Rickey 
Henderson and Mike Piazza, all the men I've admired for years. Now we have the 
same job." 
</P>
<P>
 And now women across the country want her job.

ENTERTAINMENT; ENTERTAINMENT NEWS; BACK AT HOME; CAPTAIN & TENNILLE HAVE 
ENJOYED A VALLEY FOLLOWING. THEY'LL BE HERE FOR THE FOURTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When pop recording artists The Captain & Tennille headline the 16th annual 
Fourth of July Ex travaganza at the North Campus of Cal State Northridge on 
Monday, it will be a homecoming of sorts for the husband-and-wife team. 
</P>
<P>
 Toni Tennille and Daryl Dragon are no strangers to the San Fernando Valley. 
They played regularly at the old Smokehouse Restaurant in Encino from 1972 to 
1974, almost up until the time when their first major hit, "Love Will Keep Us 
Together," was climbing up the charts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a big Valley following," Tennille remembers. "No matter where I go 
these days, I find someone from the old Smokehouse days -- they're all over." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Dragon, son of the longtime director of the Glendale Symphony, the late 
Carmen Dragon, once attended CSUN. And although the pair have lived in Nevada 
since 1984, they still own Rumbo Recording Studios in Canoga Park, which they 
built in 1979.  
</P>
<P>
 The initial success of the Grammy-winning "Love Will Keep Us Together" was 
followed by five gold albums and six gold singles, plus an ABC-TV network 
variety show. 
</P>
<P>
 They haven't had a record in the pop charts for several years but remain busy. 
Tennille has just released a new album, "Things are Swingin'," a musical 
tribute to the style of the big bands of the 1930s and '40s.  
</P>
<P>
 Tennille comes to the big band style by way of her father, Frank Tennille, who 
was a singer with orchestras led by Bob Crosby and Ben Pollack in the 1930s. 
Although she performed with Matt Catingub's Big Band at the Moonlight Tango 
Cafe last summer, Tennille could not remember the last time The Captain & 
Tennille performed in the Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to an hourlong Captain & Tennille set on Monday, Tennille also 
will perform tunes from her new album with Catingub and full orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment at the 16th annual Fourth of July Extravaganza at the North 
Campus of Cal State Northridge includes the country band Gary Hartman & the 
Weed in the Road Gang and the New Age artists The Freeway Philharmonic. The 
concert begins at 4:30 p.m. and is followed by a fireworks display at 9 p.m. 
Tickets are $12 general, $7 children and seniors. Parking is $3. Call (818) 
341-2428.  
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Really the Blues: The 75-member Los Angeles Police Concert Band will perform 
in a free concert at 5:30 p.m. Sunday at Warner Park. The band was established 
in 1914 and originally was composed entirely of active police personnel. 
Following the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, active police officers were no 
longer able to participate during duty hours, and the band was disbanded. It 
was soon replaced by the all-volunteer band, which operates without public 
funds and is made up of mostly professional musicians plus some retired and 
current LAPD officers and those from other law enforcement agencies. The 
manager of the band is Sgt. Jim Starr.  
</P>
<P>
 "They all donate their time in order to promote better community relations 
throughout the Los Angeles area," Starr said. "Music is a universal language, 
and it's good for the soul." The band, which rehearses Wednesday evenings at 
the Police Academy, plays at city and county ceremonial events and 
celebrations. Additionally, the ensemble serves as ambassadors of goodwill for 
the city throughout the United States and abroad.  
</P>
<P>
 The Valley Cultural Center will present the Los Angeles Police Concert Band at 
5:30 p.m. Sunday at Warner Center Park, 5800 Topanga Canyon Blvd., near the 
corner of Topanga and Califa Street, Woodland Hills. The concert is free, and 
parking is $1 in the lot on the east side of Owensmouth Avenue between Oxnard 
and Califa streets. Janet & Judy & the Hotbilly Boys will present a children's 
program at 4 p.m. Bring a blanket or a folding chair. Call (818) 704-1358 . *

A LOVE OF LETTERS; THE SOCIETY OF CALLIGRAPHY EXHIBIT RANGES FROM TRADITIONAL

 at the moment of communication. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 -- from "The Mystic Art of Written Forms" by F. Neugebauer 
</P>
<P>
 The calligraphic artwork on display at Century Gallery skillfully illustrates 
the sentiment of that passage. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a more lengthy excerpt from Neuge bauer's book is the centerpiece of 
Becky Rose Eisenstein's piece, "Essence," one of 35 works by 25 calligraphers 
in the show, "Expanding the Boundaries." It is the 10th biennial exhibit of the 
Society for Calligraphy, an organization of 1,000 members, about 800 of them in 
Southern California, who "share the love of letters," said Donna Lee, society 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of those exhibits that's an art exhibit and an educational exhibit. 
This is especially true because you see the tradition," said gallery director 
Lee Musgrave. In addition to the contemporary work, eight examples of medieval 
and Renaissance illuminated manuscript pages are on view. "One thing that 
distinguishes civilization from non-civilization is the ability to write. It 
was an art that was cherished by each civilization that produced it." 
</P>
<P>
 Musgrave worries that calligraphy may be a dying art, though. "People are 
coming up with new typefaces on computer -- calligraphy in that sense is 
growing," he said. But, as someone who was born and spent his early years in 
Australia, where penmanship was extremely important, he laments the fact that 
it is not emphasized in schools here. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes calligraphy to remind us that the word can tell stories -- and 
single letters can speak poetry," said John Paul Thornton, who coordinated the 
show for the society. It was juried by three calligraphers. (Thornton is a 
painter rather than a calligrapher; his father is a calligrapher.) 
</P>
<P>
 Among the contemporary works, traditional calligraphy of ink on fine paper 
shares the gallery with more unusual lettering styles on atypical surfaces, 
including canvas, a small leaf and raw eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Thornton, John Paul's father, used crayon for his work, "Today." 
"Solitude, Sweet Solitude" by Nancy Campbell is a collage. Louis L. Lemoine 
scanned into a computer and enhanced his calligraphic image for "The Alphabet." 
</P>
<P>
 "You used to only see calligraphy that was graceful," Musgrave said. 
"Calligraphy has caught up with painting in its interpretation of aesthetics. 
Calligraphy, as painting, expresses a non-aesthetic approach." 
</P>
<P>
 A few of the calligraphers have created lettering that is so expressionistic 
and abstract, it is illegible. "They are sweeping the page with these letters. 
Legibility is not as important as the process," Donna Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a phase in music when it was not just entertainment." There were 
artists, such as Joan Baez and Bob Dylan, who "wanted to convey a message," she 
said. "Calligraphy is going that way. The letters and the words and the art 
form are just the medium to convey something they want to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Those personal notes range from joyful to sorrowful and ironic. Barbara Close 
celebrates some of life's delights in her gouache and acrylic piece, "What To 
Give the Children." She recommends "open sky, clouds, rainbows, impromptu 
praise, an unexpected kiss, long days to be merry in and nights without fear." 
</P>
<P>
 De Ann Singh titled her work, "It Is Sweet To Die For One's Country," but the 
deep, dark colors of the piece and the unruly placement of the words 
communicate anything but sweetness. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration for several calligraphic statements comes from likely sources -- 
Shakespeare, Benjamin Franklin, Chinese proverbs. Reuben Allen used Prismacolor 
pencils to present the "Chinese Proverb," "One joy scatters a hundred griefs." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think calligraphers have their own issues," John Paul Thornton said. "Most 
have no ego. They do this privately. It's a very humble scene." WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
 What: "Expanding the Boundaries: The 10th Biennial Exhibit of the Society for 
Calligraphy." 
</P>

 Location: Century Gallery, 13000 Sayre St., Sylmar.

NOTES FROM ON HIGH; BURBANK CONSIDERS THE STARLIGHT BOWL ITS 'UNDISCOVERED 
GEM.' IT SEATS 6,000, OFFERS A SPECTACULAR VIEW AND BOASTS A WIDE RANGE OF 
ENTERTAINMENT.

<P>
 Thinking of going to an outdoor summer concert? There's the Hollywood Bowl, 
the Greek Theater or Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you take a ride to the hills high above Burbank, you'll discover a 
less-obvious choice -- the Starlight Bowl. The music offered is wide-ranging, 
the view spectacular, and it's often free. 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz musician Jack Sheldon returns Aug. 14 for the third year in a row, taking 
his place among other celebrities who have played the Starlight -- Bob Hope, 
Dennis Day, Jack Benny and Mel Torme. "It's such a beautiful place," says 
Sheldon, "I love being outside. Watching the sunset as the band plays brings 
out the romantic in everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon, like many people, didn't know Burbank had an outdoor concert arena 
until he was approached about playing at the Starlight. The bowl had been 
closed for so long, people seemed to forget about it. 
</P>
<P>
 But how can you miss a 40-by-80-foot stage with seating for 6,000 -- 3,000 
seats and room for 3,000 on the grass?  
</P>
<P>
 "It's our little undiscovered gem," says Gail Stewart, who is in charge of 
bowl programming. "We want to bring family-oriented entertainment back to the 
community."  
</P>
<P>
 The bowl was closed intermittently throughout the early 1980s, and had been 
completely shut down since 1986. The city hired a series of private promoters 
to book shows, "but they didn't understand the needs of a community-oriented 
venue," says Mary Alvord, Parks and Recreation director for the city of 
Burbank. Residents complained about unruly crowds who came to see rock 
concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tensions kept building," says former Mayor Mary Kelsey, "and after we had a 
lawsuit from one of the promoters, the city wasn't too anxious to do much with 
the Starlight." (The city was successfully sued for $1.5 million by a promoter 
over a contract dispute.) 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, City Council members believed such a cultural landmark shouldn't 
be allowed to wither away, and the Burbank Parks and Recreation Board was put 
in charge of the Starlight's programming in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Community events and entertainment have always been a part of the Starlight 
Bowl, where the natural amphitheater, with its phenomenal acoustics, attracted 
early Burbank citizens. More than 4,000 people attended its first recorded use 
-- Easter sunrise services in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
 The bowl may have remained unknown, however, if it weren't for conductor Leo 
Damiani, who in 1946 used it for rehearsals of what was then the Burbank 
Symphony Orchestra. Along with local city officials, Damiani realized the 
potential of this grassy spot, surrounded by tall eucalyptus. It opened June 
17, 1951. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leo could visualize what a permanent facility would mean, not only to the 
symphony but to the community as well," says Audrey Damiani of her husband, who 
died in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Damiani's connections to the entertainment business helped organize the 
recurring "Battle of Jazz and Symphony" that whimsically pitted his symphony 
against Les Brown and his Band of Renown in the late '50s and early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Damiani also created a Youth Symphony where a young Debbie Reynolds gave her 
teacher a hard time. "She didn't like the French horn; she'd put her chewing 
gum on top of it," remembers Audrey Damiani. Annette Funicello's career was 
born when Damiani staged a private dance recital of local kids at the Starlight 
in 1955 for Walt Disney, who was casting the "Mickey Mouse Club." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year the Boy Scouts had a big presentation," says Audrey Damiani. "An 
Indian appeared on horseback on the far-off hill. He shot an arrow over the 
audience, hitting the stage. That ignited a flash of light, and through a cloud 
of smoke, performers came out and the show began. It was very dramatic and a 
lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bowl was sometimes transformed into an ice arena between 1956 and 1962, 
when The Roy and April Schram Ice Show showed off the talents of local students 
and others. Roy Schram, who skated with the Ice Follies, remembers it took 
months to produce the weekend program, but it was "real theater, with sets and 
props." 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Todt, a retired librarian, remembers using "our little 16-mm projector 
from the library" to bring movies to the Starlight in the '60s. The weekly 
"Family Fun Night" let people eat picnic dinners while watching such films as 
"The Music Man," "African Queen" and "North by Northwest." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, other uses for the bowl are being explored, from film programs to 
Shakespearean theater or an opera company. "It sat empty for years, and it's 
time to use it again. We're very excited about this year," says Alvord, 
referring to a schedule that boasts Broadway singers, rock 'n' roll, Latin 
jazz, Tchaikovsky and big-band music. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes time to get momentum going, but we're anticipating great things," 
says Elaine Paonessa, a past president of the Burbank Civic Light Opera. This 
year the opera company will perform "The Pirates of Penzance," its first 
production at the Starlight theater in years. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Bauer is bringing back his morning "Kids on Stage" programs for the third 
year. "We actually have the kids take over the stage, using what they've 
learned," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel real fortunate to have the bowl as a place for us to play," says Walt 
Mears, president of the Burbank Symphony. This year, Dale Kristien from 
"Phantom of the Opera" will join the symphony at the bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Kerstein is conductor of the Burbank Chamber Orchestra, which will 
perform its inaugural concert Aug. 28 at the bowl. "I remember going to the 
Starlight as a child. Listening to the orchestra on those summer evenings 
inspired me toward music," he says. "The opportunity for me to play on that 
stage is like a dream come true." Summer Offerings

SOUNDS OF SUMMER; TWO CONCERT SERIES TAILORED FOR CHILDREN OFFER ENTERTAINMENT 
THAT'S FUN AND EDUCATIONAL. THE LINEUP INCLUDES DANCE, STORYTELLING AND 
SING-ALONGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 School may be out, but the long summer ahead does not need to be an 
educational wasteland for your children. There are two youth-oriented concert 
series that organizers promise will entertain as well as educate the ants- in- 
the- pants set. 
</P>
<P>
 Both series -- one at the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum in Topanga and the 
other at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre in Hollywood -- feature a variety of 
musicians, singers and dancers who specialize in entertaining grade-school 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Performances run 45 minutes to an hour, just long enough to hold a youngster's 
interest, and tickets are relatively inexpensive -- ranging from $3 to $7. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is clearly a niche that needs to be filled," said Linda Chiavaroli, a 
promoter for the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre series. "There is not enough good 
programming for children, especially in the summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Both are intimate theaters in natural settings, organizers say. Although the 
Ford Amphitheatre seats 1,200, no seat is more than 96 feet from the stage, 
Chiavaroli says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Theatricum seats only 500. "The theater is pretty small, so there's no 
seat that's a bad seat," said Felicia Bulmer, promoter for the Kids Koncert 
series there. "But you will be sitting on railroad ties, so bringing a pillow 
to sit on is not a bad idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Chiavaroli and Bulmer both suggest planning an after-concert picnic on the 
theater grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great way to have a birthday party," said Bulmer, who owns 
Felicia's Fairy Tales, Topanga Canyon's only children's bookstore. "Go to the 
concert, and picnic afterward." 
</P>
<P>
 Both concert series run through the end of the summer. Performances at the 
Ford Amphitheatre are scheduled Saturdays, and most begin at 10 a.m. 
Performances at the Theatricum are set Sundays, and most begin at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The John Anson Ford Amphitheatre schedule: 
</P>
<P>
 * July 9: The Jazz Tap Ensemble combines live jazz with tap dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 * July 16: Mozart, in the person of Lucinda Carver, music director of the Los 
Angeles Mozart Orchestra, arrives in a time machine. Wearing a wig and period 
clothes, she tells youngsters about her experiences performing as a prodigy. 
</P>
<P>
 * July 30: Members of the Argentine group Arco Iris demonstrate a variety of 
exotic instruments, including ones they invented, and introduce youngsters to 
the concept of creating music. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aug. 6: Seven dance companies participate in a Dance Kaleidoscope, showing 
youngsters the potential of the human body as well as the possibilities of 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aug. 13: The Lula Washington Youth Dance Ensemble, whose performers range in 
age from 8 to 16, displays a mixture of dance styles. The youngsters in the 
show take part in an after-school program called "I do dance, not drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 * Sept. 4: The last performance of the season is also the only evening 
performance. Beginning at 6 p.m., Craig 'N Company present a 
"not-ready-for-bedtime" concert that features music relating to childhood 
experiences such as getting a first haircut.

HUNTINGTON PARK CHIEF, POLICE UNIT INVESTIGATED; LAW ENFORCEMENT: THE 
DEPARTMENT MOUNTS AN INTERNAL PROBE INTO MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS TRIGGERED BY A 
SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Huntington Park Police Department has launched an internal investigation 
into allegations of misconduct, targeting at least half a dozen officers, 
including retiring Police Chief Frank Sullivan and former members of an elite 
enforcement team, the city's interim police chief said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least five officers will be investigated on charges that the interim chief, 
Bill Reed, categorized as "medium to serious" in nature. He refused to 
elaborate on the specifics of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed said the internal inquiry stems from allegations that emerged from a 
sexual harassment claim filed against the department earlier this year by 
Officer Gina Scolari. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen officers and others have been questioned under oath by 
lawyers in the case, said Reed, who was hired by the City Council in May with a 
mandate to look into the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed said the investigations will focus on members of the Crime Impact Team, 
an eight-man unit headed by Sullivan and created in 1990 to target drugs, gangs 
and other special assignments. Sullivan served as operations commander of the 
team, which was disbanded in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a deposition given in the sexual harassment case that spurred the 
investigation, and several officers who asked not to be identified, Crime 
Impact Team members engaged in misconduct and were "bulletproof" to 
repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
 In a deposition obtained by The Times, former Huntington Park Officer Radames 
Gil, now a detective with the Los Angeles Housing Authority Police Department, 
charges other officers with sexual misconduct, stealing evidence and covering 
up police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
 Gil left the Huntington Park Police Department in 1990 after being threatened 
with termination for allegedly having sex with a 17-year-old girl, a charge 
that he denies. According to his sworn testimony, Gil asserts that he was 
forced out of the department because of his knowledge of alleged sexual 
misconduct by Sullivan and other Crime Impact Team members. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan did not return repeated phone calls from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed met with Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti on June 23 regarding 
a possible criminal investigation into some of the allegations, he said. The 
district attorney's office would not confirm whether an investigation was under 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed defended the Police Department, saying that a "clique that did some bad 
things" is not representative of the entire force. "The members of this 
department are hard-working people who for the most part do a great job," Reed 
said. "There's just a few people that need to be investigated and have the 
proper action taken." 
</P>
<P>
 Scolari, who names Sullivan and Sgt. Robert Mercado in her claim, is 
negotiating a settlement with the city, sources close to the case said. Neither 
she nor her attorney returned calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercado, who was a member of the Crime Impact Team and who was placed on 
administrative leave last month, vehemently denied all charges against him and 
the special unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no misconduct among the CIT," Mercado said. "People can allege 
anything they want and other people have to suffer for it." 
</P>
<P>
 After less than two years as chief, Sullivan stepped down May 10 a day after 
the City Council placed him on administrative leave amid allegations of sexual 
harassment, discrimination and favoritism. But he is being allowed to collect 
his $7,714 monthly salary until he reaches retirement in November. Mercado also 
was placed on administrative leave.

OFFICIALS URGE SOCCER FANS TO HALT VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The syntax was awkward, the grammar was flawed, but the sentiment of a 
telephone call taped by an answering machine in Los Angeles City Councilman 
Mike Hernandez's office was powerful nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 The gist was that the anonymous caller was embarrassed by the unruly crowds of 
World Cup fans who celebrated Tuesday in Huntington Park, after Mexico's 1-1 
tie with Italy ensured the team's advance into the next round of competition. 
Police made 17 arrests during the wild disturbance, for everything from traffic 
violations to assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I witnessed yesterday, it hurts my heart," said the man on the tape. 
"Today is a very sad day for the Hispanic and Latino community in which I live. 
. . . What can we do to instill into our youngsters the character and the 
morality that I was taught from my father?" 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Hernandez played the tape of the telephone call when he joined 
the City Council's two other Latino members -- Richard Alatorre and Richard 
Alarcon -- and Police Chief Willie L. Williams at a news conference to plead 
with Los Angeles' soccer fans to keep rejoicing lawful. 
</P>
<P>
 All took pains to say that their appeal was to all soccer fans, not just those 
backing Mexico. And Williams said that "peaceful, joyous and even boisterous" 
celebrations are encouraged, even if the crowds shut down streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Williams vowed, a line will be drawn. "If we have window-breaking, if we 
have vandalism, if we have assaults, if we have open, lewd behavior or anything 
like that, we're not going to tolerate it." 
</P>
<P>
 The department is not planning to automatically increase staffing on game days 
but is ready to do so when necessary, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The melee Tuesday was one of several that have erupted in Huntington Park 
since World Cup competition began. In response, officials are planning to 
impose a 10 p.m. curfew and to provide police reinforcements for Tuesday, when 
the Mexican team starts second-round play in a game in New Jersey. Arrests also 
were made Tuesday night in Santa Ana, on the Eastside, and in Boyle Heights and 
Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we celebrate . . . we have to remember that we have the responsibility to 
do it in a way that does not impact other people or the community around us," 
said Alarcon, whose district includes the northeast San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, who represents part of the Eastside, said the telephone call to his 
office has been echoed in numerous conversations with constituents this week. 
At a time when Gov. Pete Wilson and other politicians seem to be attacking 
immigrants, he urged soccer fans in the city to "bring respect and pride to our 
community" by behaving responsibly.

YOUTH, 16, ARRESTED IN ATTACK ON LIFEGUARDS; CRIME: OFFICIALS SAY THE SUSPECT 
WAS INVOLVED IN ONE OF THREE RECENT VIOLENT INCIDENTS AT A WATTS SWIMMING POOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 16-year-old boy was arrested Thursday on suspicion of attacking several 
lifeguards at a public swimming pool in Watts, one of three attacks since the 
pool opened for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, whose name was not released because of his age, was arrested by 
Los Angeles County Park Police at the Will Rogers pool about 1 p.m. after 
authorities received several tips that he was involved in the attacks and 
probably would return to the pool, said Park Police Chief John Zrofsky. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth, described by police as a gang member, was booked at the sheriff's 
Century station on a charge of assaulting a public officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge stems from an attack at the pool Monday that occurred after a 
lifeguard tried to restrain a youth who had been roughhousing in the water, 
authorities said. At that point, several suspected gang members jumped a fence 
around the pool area and began beating the lifeguard. A melee erupted as other 
lifeguards tried to intervene. Some of the lifeguards suffered cuts and 
bruises, one a broken nose and another several cracked teeth.  
</P>
<P>
 Zrofsky said the first attack occurred last Saturday, the pool's first day of 
summer swimming. More serious violence erupted Tuesday when lifeguard Paul Alba 
tried to protect a 13-year-old boy apparently being hazed by older youths. Alba 
was severely beaten and remained in critical condition Thursday at Martin 
Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Zrofsky said about 30 youths were involved in the attacks; additional suspects 
are being sought. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply are not going to tolerate this," Zrofsky said. "These lifeguards 
are there to save lives, not to be victims of brutal assaults." 
</P>
<P>
 Zrofsky said it is unlikely that the attacks are linked to new fees imposed on 
pool patrons this summer. Children must pay $1 to swim and adults $2. Many area 
residents have complained that the fees are a burden for poor families. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably a combination of things," Zrofsky said, "heat, frustration, 
competing gangs. We think the attacks have been more of an opportunistic 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, who represents the 
neighborhood, called for calm Thursday as she went to the hospital to check on 
Alba, who remained in a coma, and talk to his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said she is concerned over how the admission charges might affect poorer 
families and is soliciting donations to offset the fees. So far, about $65,000 
has been raised, and Burke said the money will be used to eliminate fees for 
children at Will Rogers and other pools in her district, possibly by this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said conditions at the pool were calm Thursday as extra 
police patrols continued a constant watch over the usually crowded facility. 
Samuel V. Jones, assistant director of the county's Parks and Recreation 
Department, said only 50 to 60 people were at a pool that traditionally 
averages 500 to 600 people on hot summer days. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jones said park police and other staff had received dozens of calls from 
outraged residents as word filtered through the community about the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of people are coming up and inquiring how Paul is doing or 
indicating they know who the individuals were that did it and where they can be 
found," he said. "We're hopeful all of this will result in more arrests."

INGLEWOOD CASINO READY FOR FIRST DEAL; GAMING: FISCAL SOLVENCY AND JOBS ARE ON 
THE TABLE AS HOLLYWOOD PARK CLUB OPENS TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA RICHARDSON and JON GARCIA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With newly trained local dealers ready to hit the tables today, one major 
hurdle remains for the Hollywood Park Casino card club in Inglewood: to make 
money, lots of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Riding on the success of the club are jobs for at least 2,000 residents, as 
well as fiscal solvency for the city. Inglewood officials have written in a 
nonexistent $4 million in taxes from the club to balance the 1994-1995 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The club, featuring 150 gaming tables, 24-hour amenities such as a health 
club, karaoke suites and two restaurants, will open after two years of delays. 
That the club, the third largest in the state, is opening at all is a coup for 
Inglewood because the casino suffered several major setbacks during its efforts 
to gain state approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "That card club saves us all -- it saves the residents of Inglewood," 
Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent said after the club received state permission to 
open. "It was a long, hard road, but this is the best thing that could possibly 
happen to the city of Inglewood." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have been trained to deal cards in a special school to help fulfill 
a promise to hire those who live in Inglewood -- people such as Sean Allen.  
</P>
<P>
 Tantalized by stories of the good money to be had as a card dealer, Allen, 22, 
quit his job at his parents' real estate company last year and enrolled in a 
12-week course at the Gaming Academy in Inglewood, where he learned how to deal 
cards professionally. 
</P>
<P>
 But dealers earn minimum wage, $4.25 an hour, and most of their income will 
come from tips, which means Allen will make money only if lots of people go to 
the card club.  
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park, its investors, Inglewood residents and city officials are 
making the same gamble.  
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Paul D. Eckles has estimated that the club could provide $10 
million a year to Inglewood's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Legislature approved a bill that would have allowed Hollywood 
Park racetrack to run the club, but Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed it on the grounds 
that the state does not have the staff to investigate gambling enterprises 
owned by corporations with thousands of unknown stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the city found investors that included Edward Allred, a partner in the 
Los Alamitos racetrack, to run the club, and the casino was scheduled to open 
in January. But Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren's office refused to issue a license on 
the grounds that Allred previously owned stock in out-of-state gambling 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 But the club finally found acceptable managers when former National Football 
League executives Eddie LeBaron and Don Klosterman agreed in April to pay $3 
million a month to run it.  
</P>
<P>
 LeBaron and Klosterman are betting that some of the crowds who visit Inglewood 
will patronize the casino. The racetrack draws about 5 million people annually, 
Klosterman said, and the Forum attracts an additional 2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the card club to be a success it will have to attract the hard-core 
gaming aficionados who make up a large block of any casino's clientele, LeBaron 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Of course doing this is a risk -- but it's a calculated risk," LeBaron said. 
"We think this is going to attract a lot of new players, it will attract people 
who like sports, people who like the racetrack itself and then the serious card 
players, who believe me, will travel to a good casino." 
</P>
<P>
 The card club has already raised some people's fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 Things seemed bleak for Inglewood resident Valerie A. Lewis, 31, when she was 
laid off from her job as a lease analyst for Unocal. But Lewis went to the 
Gaming Academy to learn how to deal and then landed a job at the Bicycle Club 
in Bell Gardens. There she made twice as much money as she did at Unocal, she 
said. Today, she begins work at Hollywood Park, with even higher hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good dealer can make $4,000 a month," Lewis said. "But I don't intend on 
staying a dealer. I want to move up in the industry." 
</P>
<P>
 And business is not bad for Jean Williams, owner of the Gaming Academy. 
Williams used the savings she earned as a desktop publisher to learn how to 
deal and then opened the three-room academy on Manchester Boulevard, just up 
the street from the Forum. The course costs $1,200 to $2,500 depending on 
whether students take a few classes or a three-month course. 
</P>
<P>
 Days before the opening, the newly minted dealers practiced how to build a 
rapport with the players. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a connection between the dealer and the players," Allen said. "If 
you learn to get along with a positive attitude, you bring out the best in the 
players and they bring out the best in you . . . win or lose."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY TO 
STUDY IMPACT OF KEEPING LANDFILL OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles city panel ordered a study Thursday on the environmental impact 
of expanding a municipal landfill slated to be closed in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in Lake View Terrace favor shutting the Lopez Canyon landfill, the 
last city-run dump.But alternatives -- such as hauling trash by rail to Utah -- 
could drive up costs.  
</P>
<P>
 "On proceeding with the environmental process, I think it's very important to 
do that as quickly as possible," Public Works Commissioner J. P. Ellman said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't rule out the possibility of an alternative," she said. "We're 
still proceeding with that, looking for alternatives to Lopez," she said. "We 
need to have something to take our refuse in February, 1996."  
</P>
<P>
 In two weeks, the Board of Public Works will consider approving specifications 
for proposals from trash haulers interested in shipping the city's refuse to a 
private landfill or to Utah.  
</P>
<P>
 Residents in the San Fernando Valley community have long complained about 
odors and trash polluting their neighborhood and truck traffic clogging their 
streets.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Laura Chick, head of the council's Environmental Quality and 
Waste Management Committee, said the city might have no choice but to keep 
Lopez Canyon open if the alternatives cost $10 million to $20 million more a 
year.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; MTA 
OFFICERS WILL BEGIN POLICING BLUE LINE TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Metropolitan Transportation Authority police will take over for sheriff's 
deputies and begin patrolling the Blue Line trolley starting today.  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this spring, the MTA board rejected a bid by the county Sheriff's 
Department and the Los Angeles Police Department to begin policing the transit 
lines.The agency opted to use its own officers, saying it would save money. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA police will start monitoring the Blue Line, which runs between 
Downtown Los Angeles and Long Beach, as well as the Green Line, which will run 
between El Segundo and Downey when it opens in 1995. Sheriff's deputies have 
patrolled the Blue Line since it opened. 
</P>
<P>
 "MTA Police are undergoing training and orientation in Blue Line security to 
ensure a seamless transition on July 1," said MTA Police Chief Sharon Papa. 
"They will patrol the rail cars, station platforms, grade crossings, and staff 
the dispatch center." 
</P>
<P>
 In the next fiscal year, the MTA Police will add 79 officers, enlarging the 
department to 425 officers and 114 security officers.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; REJECTED 
BALLOTS WILL NOW BE COUNTED IN COUNCIL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long Beach officials, preparing for today's court-ordered inspection of 
questionable ballots in a narrow City Council race, have announced that several 
provisional and absentee ballots appear to have been "inappropriately rejected" 
from the original tally. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Atty.Robert E. Shannon said at least five ballots in the June 7 
election that initially were rejected for various reasons now seem to be valid 
and should be counted. Contractor Mike Donelon now holds a one-vote lead over 
Tonia Reyes Uranga. Shannon said he does not know which candidates the five 
ballots favored. 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga led Donelon on election night. But during a recount last week, the city 
clerk's office discovered that election workers had failed to tally seven 
absentee ballots -- six of them favoring Donelon. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Robert H. O'Brien on Tuesday blocked the City Council 
from certifying the recount and ruled that Uranga can inspect 20 to 30 
provisional and absentee ballots that were rejected by City Clerk Shelba 
Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga is scheduled to examine the ballots today at 1 p.m. in City Hall.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: HAYDEN SEEKS PROBE OF 
RIORDAN'S SUPPORT FOR LIGHT RAIL PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) called Thursday for a state agency to 
examine Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan's actions affecting a company in 
which the mayor is an investor. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden announced that he has asked the Fair Political Practices Commission to 
investigate Riordan's actions as a Metropolitan Transportation Authority board 
member.A local transit activist filed a similar request Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan has said he had no way of knowing in August that his championing of a 
$97-million appropriation for the proposed Pasadena line rail project would 
affect the company, Tetra Tech Inc. The mayor said he sought the funding only 
to resolve a dispute among MTA board members. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported Sunday that Tetra Tech received $267,000 from the MTA for 
engineering services on the rail project within seven weeks of Riordan's 
action. Tetra Tech had received a contract from the MTA in June, 1993, one 
month before the mayor took office. Riordan owns $9.75 million of the company's 
stock and was a director of the firm from 1988 to 1992.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; FAMILIES 
OF 2 'STOOGES' SUE MGM GRAND FOR $1 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How did Moe rate the dough? And not Curly Joe? 
</P>
<P>
 Heirs of two of the Three Stooges sued the MGM Grand for $1 million Thursday, 
claiming that the actors' likenesses were used in hotel and theme park 
performances without compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Grandchildren of the late Larry Fine and the widow of "Curly Joe" DeRita 
alleged that they were excluded from a licensing agreement between the hotel 
and descendants of head stooge Moe Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 MGM Grand lawyers had not seen the lawsuit and would not comment on it, said a 
spokeswoman at the company's Las Vegas headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit also asks for any profits the hotel has made on the actors' 
images. It claims that a March 5, 1993, agreement between the hotel and Moe's 
descendants covers use of the names, faces, voices and antics of the entire 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaintiffs are John Joseph Fine Jr., Phyllis Lorraine Miller, Christy Lynn 
Clark and Kris Cutler, all grandchildren of Fine; and Jean DeRita, widow of 
Joseph Franklin Wardell, known as "Curly Joe" DeRita. 
</P>
<P>
 The Three Stooges began in vaudeville in 1923 as Ted Healy and His Stooges. 
The trio, which specialized in slapstick roughhousing, included various members 
over the years, among them Curly, Moe and Shemp Howard, as well as Fine, Joe 
Besser and DeRita. DeRita joined in 1959, replacing Besser, and appeared in 
several feature films.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA CLARITA; 
RESIDENTS JOIN SEARCH FOR REAL ESTATE AGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dozens of people in the Santa Clarita community of Val Verde joined Thursday 
with sheriff's search-and-rescue parties to look for a real estate agent who 
vanished a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Harrington, 26, disappeared after leaving her office Wednesday afternoon 
with an unidentified man who asked to see vacant, remote houses in the 
unincorporated community of 1,500.The area is off California 126 about five 
miles northwest of the Magic Mountain theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 By late afternoon, deputies suspended their search and announced that a man 
taken into custody earlier had been cleared and released. Detectives who had 
feared that Harrington had been abducted and killed changed their approach 
after bank security cameras recorded the missing woman making a $300 withdrawal 
from an automated teller machine in Hacienda Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "For sure it's a missing person, and possibly a kidnaping," said Lt. Donald 
Bear, a sheriff's detective.

BORROWING SOME HOPE; COUNSELING AGENCY ON SKID ROW OPENS A LIBRARY FOR THE 
HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At any other library, it wouldn't be unusual for someone to check out a book 
about buying and selling a single-family home. But for Melvin Carr, whose home 
is now at a drug rehabilitation center on Downtown's Skid Row, the opportunity 
to borrow that book allows him to dream of better days ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get a home one day, but right now it's interesting just to read 
about it," the 42-year-old former bank clerk explained Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Carr borrowed that volume, along with others about auto repairs and economics, 
from Project Open Door, a drop-in counseling agency on Skid Row that offers 
visitors a 2,000-volume lending library and a quiet place to read. Formally 
dedicated Thursday, the storefront in the Crescent Hotel on East 5th Street is 
a literary and friendly haven from the chaos outside. 
</P>
<P>
 The books, magazines and newspapers maintain crucial connections beyond Skid 
Row, explained the Rev. William Monroe Campbell, Project Open Door's 
coordinator. "Once you get out on the row, you can lose touch of what's going 
on in other communities. So this," he said, pointing to the bookshelves and 
periodical racks, "is part of the re-socialization process." 
</P>
<P>
 Project Open Door was established by the Canaan Housing Corporation, the arm 
of the Second Baptist Church of Los Angeles that has helped rehabilitate Skid 
Row hotels, including the Crescent. The Los Angeles Public Library donated 
surplus books, tables and shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless people often used the Los Angeles Central Library in Downtown while 
it was housed temporarily on Spring Street during the rebuilding of its regular 
home after tragic fires. Officials say the Skid Row population has been less 
evident in public reading rooms since the Central Library returned last fall to 
its location between Grand Avenue and Flower Street on 5th Street. That library 
now may be too far away from Skid Row, or the homeless may feel uncomfortable 
in the upscale neighborhood of office towers, said Fontayne Holmes, the library 
system's assistant director of branches. 
</P>
<P>
 Skid Row residents are like everyone else -- they want a wide variety of books 
within easy access, said Holmes, who helped with the book donations. Among the 
stock at Project Open Door are Bibles, a biography of actor Laurence Olivier, 
hard-boiled mysteries by Dick Francis and the classic Harper Lee novel "To Kill 
a Mockingbird." 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes stressed that the mini-library inside the storefront was not intended 
to discourage the homeless from using the Central Library. "Absolutely not," 
she added. "Our doors are open except if somebody is disturbing other people in 
an outward way." 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the dedication ceremony began Thursday, a homeless woman came into 
Project Open Door and began waving around a large meat cleaver and shouting 
profanities. No one was hurt and a security guard knocked the cleaver from her 
hand. Police arrived at the scene but did not arrest the woman, who Rev. 
Campbell said was recently evicted from the hotel upstairs because of 
disturbances. She later demanded her weapon back, but Campbell gently told her: 
"I can't do that." The speeches and luncheon that followed were not disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Books are often an introduction to Project Open Door's other services, such as 
alcohol and drug recovery support groups, housing and employment referrals, 
clothing distribution and free use of telephones to contact family and friends. 
"We didn't want simply to warehouse bodies, to put people in homes and leave 
them there. We wanted to go further and provide programs of outreach," 
explained Anna Campbell, who is Canaan Housing's executive director and the 
sister of Campbell.

STATE TO PAY COLISEUM COST AFTER U.S. GOVERNMENT DOES; REPAIRS: AN OFFICIAL 
SAYS SHORT-TERM FINANCING IS A LIKELY OPTION FOR ITS 10% SHARE OF EXPENSES IN 
FIXING THE QUAKE-DAMAGED SPORTS STADIUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson is personally committed to seeing that the state pays its 10% 
share of earthquake repairs at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, but only 
after the federal government pays its 90% share, according to Wilson's chief 
disaster aide. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been common practice in other disasters that the state portion is the 
last to come in," said Richard Andrews, director of the state Office of 
Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews said that despite voters' rejection last month of an earthquake bond 
issue that would have paid the state share of the Coliseum repairs and many 
other public quake repair projects, the Administration has already initiated an 
alternative way to generate the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state director of finance is pursuing short-term financing, and we do not 
anticipate that there will be any slow-up of any project as a result of needing 
our legally mandated 10%," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Coliseum, where repairs will reach $50 million, compared to the initial 
estimate of $35 million, officials said they have won solid assurances from the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency that there will be sufficient funds to see 
the facility through its projected reopening Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Coliseum will be ready for football and as many as 68,000 
spectators then, project consultant Gerard J. Quinn said, substantial work will 
continue for months thereafter to finish the repairs. Only after the reopening 
will the 90% federal share be exhausted and state funds required, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conducting a tour of the repair work Wednesday, Coliseum project director Don 
C. Webb said he wanted to emphasize that the costs have risen "not because they 
are out of control, but because we're doing more than we ever anticipated 
doing" when work was started. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are substantially strengthening and reinforcing the structure from a 
seismic point of view," Webb said. "This protects the work we are doing against 
possible future damage from another earthquake, and at the same time should 
convey a sense of confidence to the public that the facility is safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said drilling of piles for seismic reinforcing should be finished 
Saturday. Major reconstruction of the upper-level concourse and the peristyle, 
as well as the sealing of cracks in the superstructure and replacement of 
damaged seating, is on schedule, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only remaining big decision is what to do with the severely damaged press 
box. Webb said he favors demolishing it, providing temporary press seating for 
this season and building a new press box in the future.

DESPERATELY SEEKING WOULD-BE MADONNAS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Many swore that they have never been Madonna wanna-bes. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than 250 hopefuls dressed like the sensational and sometimes 
foulmouthed pop singer and waited in line outside a Burbank casting agency 
Thursday for the opportunity of a lifetime: playing Madonna in a two-hour 
television movie about her early career. 
</P>
<P>
 Several television and newspaper reporters were on hand at the casting call, 
giving the aspiring actresses a taste of what being a celebrity is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not used to all this media, but I'm getting used to it," said Andrea 
Schurgin, 24, of Burbank, who brought her own microphone and a pair of backup 
singers, Naomi Okabe and Alyssa Romano. 
</P>
<P>
 The three friends spent $50 for matching stockings, hair ribbons and rubber 
bracelets such as the ones Madonna wore in her "Lucky Star" video. They 
practiced lip-syncing and twirling for three hours in front of a living room 
mirror Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, such as Denise Vlasis of Sherman Oaks, came with considerably more 
experience. She is a professional Madonna impersonator who earns more than $200 
an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the Katy & Co. casting agency, the hopefuls performed 30-second dance 
routines and read from a script in front of a casting director and the 
producers of "Madonna: The Early Years." 
</P>
<P>
 The film is set to begin shooting this month and will air on the Fox network 
in the fall. It chronicles Madonna's life as a struggling artist in 1978 to the 
success of her "Like a Virgin" album in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 "It opens with a girl from Detroit who came to New York with $37 and was so 
broke she was eating out of garbage cans and squatting in abandoned buildings," 
said Michael Murray, the movie's scriptwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The early part of her career is the least examined and, in some ways, the 
most interesting," he added. "She was a street urchin who turned herself into a 
superstar."

BELL ATLANTIC, NYNEX PLAN CELLULAR MERGER; TELECOMMUNICATIONS: THE DEAL FUELS 
SPECULATION THAT AIRTOUCH COULD BECOME A THIRD PARTNER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex Corp. formally announced Thursday that they will 
merge their cellular telephone operations -- a move that industry executives 
and analysts said is just the first step in the development of a nationwide 
wireless communications alliance that may ultimately include Sprint Corp. and 
California's Airtouch. 
</P>
<P>
 The two big East Coast phone companies said size and broad geographic coverage 
will be crucial for success in the fast-growing but increasingly competitive 
wireless communications business. With AT&T Corp. seeking to buy McCaw 
Cellular, and MCI Communications allying itself with national wireless service 
provider Nextel, regional cellular operators will have little choice but to 
join forces, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will see consortiums like mad among the regional players," said Sharon 
Armbrust, senior analyst at Paul Kagan & Associates, a Carmel, Calif.-based 
research firm. 
</P>
<P>
 If regulators approve -- and analysts expect little trouble on that front -- 
the merged cellular operations of Bell Atlantic and Nynex will be worth about 
$13 billion and cover a region with a population of 55 million, making the new 
entity the nation's second-largest cellular service provider behind McCaw. The 
deal is by far the largest ever between the Baby Bells created by the breakup 
of AT&T a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new cellular behemoth will still be limited largely to the Northeast, 
and speculation was rife Thursday that Airtouch, recently spun off from Pacific 
Telesis Group, will soon emerge as a third partner, either through an equity 
investment or a business alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Airtouch declined to comment specifically on the rumors. "We've been talking 
to companies about partnering to provide a seamless network," said Amy 
Damianakes, spokeswoman for Airtouch. Airtouch was set to make an announcement 
of a wireless deal with Nynex earlier this year but canceled at the last minute 
for unspecified reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprint Corp., the No. 3 long-distance company and the only one without a major 
wireless alliance, was also cited as a likely partner. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of recent developments have accelerated the trend toward 
consolidation in the cellular business. The House of Representatives on Tuesday 
passed a communications deregulation bill that includes a provision allowing 
Bell companies to carry long-distance calls that originate with cellular 
telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Federal Communications Commission later this year will auction off 
licenses for personal communications services, a new class of wireless services 
that will supplement and compete with cellular systems. Groups that want to 
form national wireless networks will need PCS licenses to fill in missing 
patches in their networks. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the announcements) have cleared the way to make wireless one of the 
greatest growth markets in the next 10 years," said Raymond W. Smith, chairman 
and chief executive of Bell Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Kagan & Associates estimates the number of cellular subscribers 
nationwide will grow to 108 million in 10 years, from 17.5 million today. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts see most wireless providers eventually allying themselves with one of 
four or five groups, each capable of offering a range of services without the 
inconvenience of incompatible technologies and roaming charges from region to 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 The push toward national consolidation began last year, when AT&T announced it 
would spend $12.6 billion to acquire McCaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that deal has been hung up in the courts, the Nynex-Bell Atlantic 
transaction, by creating a powerful new competitor, may have unwittingly 
strengthened AT&T's plea to the Justice Department that it be allowed to 
complete the merger.. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI Communications followed earlier this year by spending $1.3 billion for 
just under 20% of Nextel Communications. Nextel, which uses Motorola technology 
to offer cellular-like services, says it will be able to cover 180 million 
people when its full system is in place. The company will also aggressively bid 
for PCS licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI spokesman Kevin Inda said the Bell Atlantic-Nynex merger "validates what 
we have been saying. It's very important to deliver a national brand." 
</P>
<P>
 Some industry insiders question how successful the East Coast group will be in 
building a national network. There are already companies such as Cellular One 
that offer customers many of the benefits of a national brand. And skeptics say 
Nynex and Bell Atlantic are a long way from building the end-to-end networking 
capabilities that would be required to provide a real benefit to customers.

COMPANY TOWN; CBS AND QVC CONFIRM THEIR INTENTION TO MERGE; TELEVISION: FAMILY 
TIES DROVE THE $3-BILLION ALLIANCE BETWEEN LAURENCE A. TISCH AND BARRY DILLER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the beginning and the end, it came down to Danny Tisch. 
</P>
<P>
 The second of CBS Inc. Chief Executive Laurence A. Tisch's four sons was the 
one who convinced his father to buy CBS shares in 1985 as part of an arbitrage 
play. And eight years later it was Danny who convinced his father that it was 
time to largely cash out -- after ace programmer Jeff Sagansky quit and the 
network lost the NFL and eight key affiliates to Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 That advice led directly to the merger discussions with home shopping pioneer 
QVC Inc. In confirming their plans Thursday, Tisch and QVC Chairman Barry 
Diller said they hope to take the tentative $3-billion agreement to their 
boards for approval by July 13. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS-QVC would create a new kind of TV giant combining the vast reach of a 
major network with the technological know-how of a scrappy cable competitor. It 
would also give Diller, one of the industry's savviest executives, a powerful 
new platform, and Tisch a lucrative exit from daily management of the business. 
His payout has been estimated at more than $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
 While many on Wall Street, including Tisch, are treating the merger as a fait 
accompli, Diller was more cautious in discussions with CBS executives Thursday. 
He and his advisers consider the list of prospective rivals "remarkably short," 
but one name that has them worried is that of billionaire Marvin Davis, who has 
also been interested in acquiring NBC. Knowledgeable sources say Tisch scowled 
and muttered, "I will never sell my stock to him," when Davis' name came up at 
a luncheon meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tisch's eagerness to sell to Diller may reflect his own restlessness as much 
as the quality of the deal. Wall Street responded to the news Thursday by 
driving CBS' price up $50 a share to $313 on the New York Stock Exchange. QVC 
rose $5.625 to $38 on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks following Fox's raid on eight key CBS affiliates in May, Tisch 
had tired of the grind of the business, people close to him say. After huddling 
with Danny and other family members for advice last month, the 71-year-old 
billionaire is said to have put the word out to investment bankers: "If you got 
a good offer, I'm yours." 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting eagerly in the wings was Diller, who had just lost a brutal, 
$10-billion takeover battle for Paramount Communications Inc. to Viacom Inc. 
Sources say Diller formally approached Tisch five weeks ago. While the two 
temperamental executives had never been close, there was a connection. Diller 
is a good friend of Tisch's nephew Steve, a veteran Hollywood producer with 
movies such as "Risky Business" and the upcoming "Forrest Gump" to his credit. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Diller was already telling CBS executives that his vision of the 
company was radically different from Tisch's. Although the two jointly appeared 
at Howard Stringer's executive lunch in the CBS boardroom, Diller's comments 
were a stark repudiation of the Tisch era, emphasizing the need to grow the 
company and push it aggressively into cable. 
</P>
<P>
 "To compete in today's marketplace, it is a virtual necessity to vertically 
integrate," Diller declared. He conceded that much of the talk about the 
so-called information superhighway is premature. Then, almost sounding like 
Tisch, he said that "it's not about hardware and technology, it's about 
programming and product." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Diller nearly lost his shot at CBS in the early going. Tisch, who 
had turned his back on offers before, did the same with Diller initially on 
grounds that he didn't like the structure. But a few weeks later, after Diller 
had recrafted the deal as a merger among equals rather than a cash buyout, 
Tisch flashed his interest. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS plans to acquire QVC in a stock swap, after a $2.5-billion cash payout to 
its shareholders in a deal that was kept from its own senior executives until 
the end. Tisch told only CBS Inc. Chief Financial Officer Peter Keegan -- his 
closest confidant inside the company -- and Broadcast Group President Howard 
Stringer of his talks with Diller last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Tisch family friends first sensed things were amiss two weeks ago when Tisch 
attended the state dinner for Japanese Emperor Akihito with his wife, Billie. 
The affair was attended by hundreds of dignitaries, including a large 
contingent of powerful media executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Tisch was a self-made billionaire long before he got involved with 
CBS, the network provided him a kind of cachet that an empire built on 
insurance, hotels, cigarettes and expensive watches never could. That evening 
in Washington, as Tisch sat among the country's power and cultural elite, was a 
symbol of lifetime achievement.  
</P>
<P>
 "You know, for all the grief we've been through, it's finally been worth it," 
Billie Tisch told a friend afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 The grief to which she referred was the public glare, indeed sometimes hostile 
criticism, that Tisch endured as chairman and guiding hand behind one of the 
world's premier communications companies. Running CBS was like living in the 
proverbial fishbowl, with every move scrutinized by an uncompromising press and 
frequently ungrateful affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 When Tisch began accumulating shares in CBS in 1985, the longtime investor was 
a virtual unknown to CBS executives -- the late founder William S. Paley even 
confused Tisch with Tishman, a New York-based contractor. CBS, which had just 
emerged from a takeover attempt by Ted Turner and was still vulnerable to 
hostile bidders, turned to Tisch as a white knight. 
</P>
<P>
 But he wasted no time in quickly asserting control. After months of mounting 
frustration with then-Chief Executive Thomas H. Wyman, Tisch in 1986 was 
elected chief executive in a dramatic boardroom coup. He immediately set about 
doing what many feared Turner would have done had he succeeded in taking over 
CBS: selling off the company's prized assets, such as its book and magazine 
publishing divisions, along with the crown jewel, CBS Records. 
</P>
<P>
 For many inside CBS, the writing was on the wall as far back as 1991, when 
Tisch announced a $2-billion stock buyback. When he assembled top CBS 
executives to give the news, the first words out of his mouth were, "We're not 
going to be a conglomerate." Moreover, it was clear none of his sons would be 
entering the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Diller was seen as one of the last people to fill the succession 
role at CBS. People close to Tisch believed that if he ever did sell the 
network, it would go to a blue chip suitor, such as Walt Disney Co. Disney even 
had an edge because Tisch had long known the parents of Disney Chief Executive 
Michael D. Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Tisch was said not to hold Diller in the highest regard. Once, when 
a CBS executive walked into Tisch's office to tell him he was going to work for 
Diller at Fox, Tisch blurted out, "He (Diller) can't do that!" The executive 
informed Tisch it was certainly possible because he didn't have a contract. 
"But you can't trust Barry!" Tisch snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS is also something of a surprise move for Diller, since he loudly 
proclaimed upon leaving Fox that he would never work for anyone else again. 
Throughout his career, Diller has served under strong-willed entrepreneurs -- 
Leonard Goldenson of ABC, Charles Bludhorn of Paramount and Rupert Murdoch of 
Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, at CBS-QVC, although Diller would head the executive committee, the board 
of the merged companies would still favor CBS directors, and Tisch's Loews 
Corp. would control about 10% of the stock.  
</P>
<P>
 "He gave up something he wanted for something else he really wanted," said one 
adviser close to Diller. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS should soon notice their contrasting styles. Tisch's no-frills operating 
procedure -- his favorite refrain when fingering some overstaffed division is 
to criticize it for being a "belt and suspenders operation" -- extends to his 
Spartan office at Loews, which associates joke is furnished like a 1960 Holiday 
Inn motel room. Tisch eschews limos and can be seen leaving Manhattan dinner 
parties by hailing a taxi back to his Fifth Avenue apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 As a matter of business philosophy, Tisch puts little stock in appearances, 
right down to the gritty soot accumulating on the uncleaned windows of Black 
Rock, the famous CBS headquarters in New York, which used to be washed weekly 
under CBS patriarch William S. Paley. 
</P>
<P>
 Diller, on the other hand, has long thought of himself as an heir apparent 
without a kingdom. He has spent most of his adult working life preparing for 
the ascension. Diller started in the mail room of the William Morris agency and 
within a few short years was heading programming at ABC. Before 40 he was 
running Paramount Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in play, Tisch and Diller are opposites. Tisch is a champion bridge 
player who unwinds by inviting friends to his Westchester, N.Y., home for 
aggressive games of doubles tennis and iced tea. Diller rides motorcycles, 
commutes between his Malibu, Coldwater Canyon and New York homes on a corporate 
jet, and socializes with fashion designers, writers and artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Tisch's one flirtation with high rolling came in programming, with huge 
write-downs to pay for expensive sports broadcast contracts (prior to losing 
the NFL). He also paid $42 million to woo David Letterman away from NBC in the 
talent raid of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Tisch has always been a contrarian, in business as well as 
broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
 While rival networks NBC and Capital Cities/ABC were jumping into the cable TV 
by launching new networks, Tisch warmed the bench, insisting that the last 
thing CBS needed was "another new toy in the house." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, during the Tisch reign, CBS has made only two substantial 
acquisitions: a TV station in Miami (a move it was forced into when NBC bought 
its affiliate there) and another TV station in Minneapolis. Eventually, CBS 
executives became exasperated and stopped proposing deals.  
</P>
<P>
 "You'd sit in on one presentation and it would be summarily rejected," one 
executive recalled. Tisch would even make a physical gesture -- a motion like 
he was swatting imaginary flies -- whenever someone proposed a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 And though Tisch could be refreshingly blunt in a business famous for 
doublespeak and herd-like instincts, he frequently turned a deaf ear to the 
once-proud CBS image. 
</P>
<P>
 When executives tried to counsel him on how to handle the latest flare-up at 
CBS News or some programming imbroglio, Tisch would invariably say: "So What? 
One bad story in the newspaper and the next day everybody will forget about 
it." The Companies at a Glance

PROPOSED DEAL WOULD CREATE RAIL MONOLITH; MERGERS: BURLINGTON NORTHERN AND 
SANTA FE PACIFIC HOPE TO PERSUADE ICC AND STOCKHOLDERS TO OK $2.7-BILLION 
UNION. 
</P>

<P>
 Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Pacific Corp. said Thursday that they have 
signed a definitive agreement to merge in a $2.7-billion stock swap that would 
create the nation's largest railroad. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger would combine Burlington Northern's routes in the Pacific 
Northwest, Midwest and Southeast with Santa Fe's lines in California, the 
Southwest and the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deal makes extraordinarily good sense," according to Susan Chapman, rail 
analyst with Forbes, Walsh, Kelly & Co. in New York, adding that the merger had 
been "rumored for six to eight months." 
</P>
<P>
 The deal is by no means certain, however, because it is subject to approval by 
the Interstate Commerce Commission as well as shareholders of both companies. 
The ICC rejected a proposed mega-merger of Santa Fe and Southern Pacific in 
1986, saying the combination would not be in the public interest because it 
would reduce competition. 
</P>
<P>
 But the chances for approval are better in this case, analysts say, because 
the rail networks of Ft. Worth-based Burlington Northern and Schaumburg, 
Ill.-based Santa Fe Pacific contain little overlap and few parallel routes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, two competing railroads, Southern Pacific and Union Pacific, 
issued statements Thursday that took pains to note that the merger will be 
subject to scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be studying this proposal to assess its implications on rail 
competition and its potential effect on the industry, Southern Pacific and our 
shippers," Southern Pacific President E.L. Moyers said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 An ICC spokesman said regulators could take more than 2 1/2 years to review 
the proposal, including holding public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlington Northern Chairman Gerald Grinstein would be chairman of the new 
company and Santa Fe Pacific Chairman Robert D. Krebs would be chief executive. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe spokesman Russell Hagberg said the merger would create single-carrier 
service from all major ports in the West to the Midwest and Southeast. The 
merged railroad would be called Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. and would 
have 45,000 employees and 33,000 miles of track in 34 states. 
</P>
<P>
 All the nation's railroads face unrelenting pressure from truck lines, which 
are grabbing an increasing share of the U.S. freight-hauling market. Hagberg 
said the railroads compete best against trucks on rail lines hauling bulk or 
heavy cargoes over long distances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through efficiencies that will be created . . . we'll have the opportunity to 
take traffic from the highways," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Layoffs are a certainty if the merger goes through, although the number of 
employees losing jobs would total in the "hundreds, not the thousands," 
Burlington Northern spokesman Richard Russack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlington Northern is the second-largest U.S. railroad, with revenue of $4.7 
billion. But it operates more lines than any other railroad, with 25,000 miles 
of track in 25 states and two Canadian provinces. Santa Fe Pacific's Atchison, 
Topeka & Santa Fe line is the seventh-largest railroad, with $2.4 billion in 
revenue and 8,000 miles of track in 12 states. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlington Northern shares closed at $53.375, down 12.5 cents, and Santa Fe 
Pacific closed at $20.625, up 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange trading 
Thursday.

ALLSTATE ALSO STOPS ISSUING POLICIES FOR HOMEOWNERS; INSURANCE: MOVE IS LATEST 
IN SERIES FOLLOWING THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Allstate Insurance Co., California's second-largest homeowners insurer, 
suspended the sale of new property and earthquake insurance Thursday, saying it 
"could not afford to be the only game in town" after other major carriers had 
pulled out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The action reflects what Allstate chief counsel Robert Pike called "a grossly 
dysfunctional market, if not a market meltdown," arising from the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Allstate's move means that none of California's top three carriers -- 
including State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. and Farmers Insurance 
Group -- is actively writing new homeowners policies, and a slew of smaller 
companies have restricted their writings. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers, who were already having problems finding homeowner coverage, can 
expect those difficulties to increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Allstate said it will renew existing policies and will write new policies for 
current customers who are buying new homes. The company will also honor its 
commitments on new policies that are still in the processing stage, Pike said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has expressed concern that the lack of insurance availability 
could disrupt real estate sales and harm the economic recovery. Wilson, state 
regulators and legislators, consumer representatives and insurance industry 
officials have been meeting in recent days to discuss possible legislative 
solutions to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance industry is pushing for a repeal of the state law that requires 
homeowners insurers to offer their customers earthquake coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi last week ordered the California Fair 
Plan -- the state's high-risk property insurance pool -- to extend its 
residential and earthquake insurance statewide in order to provide last-resort 
coverage for consumers who can't find it elsewhere. The Fair Plan offers 
stripped-down fire insurance policies without liability coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Garamendi said Thursday that Allstate's action was anticipated 
and that the Fair Plan should be able to cope with the demand for coverage, at 
least in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Senate Insurance 
Committee and Democratic nominee for insurance commissioner, said he was 
investigating whether the insurers' withdrawals from the homeowners and 
earthquake market might constitute an illegal boycott of California. 
</P>
<P>
 The dominoes started falling June 9 when 20th Century Industries' two 
insurance subsidiaries -- facing claims of more than $600 million from the Jan. 
17 quake -- abruptly stopped writing new homeowners policies and stopped 
renewing existing earthquake coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers Insurance Group, California's No. 3 carrier, followed June 16 by 
suspending its writings of new homeowners and earthquake coverage. State Farm, 
under a "managed growth program," is accepting new customers only as old ones 
leave. Safeco Insurance Co., Chubb Group and TIG Insurance Co. are other large 
carriers that have restricted their sales. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Allstate says, it has been left holding the bag. The company in 
recent weeks has been writing at the rate of about 19,000 new property policies 
a month -- up 30% over last year's levels, said chief counsel Pike. And in the 
Los Angeles area, where a higher proportion of customers opt for earthquake 
coverage, new business has increased by 40% over last year, he said.

 BofA Injects $50.5 Million Into Money Market Funds: BankAmerica Corp. said it 
pumped the additional capital into two money market funds it sponsors to cover 
losses the funds incurred in selling off securities that are believed to be 
exotic "derivative" investments, though the bank did not specify them as such. 
The capital infusion into the $680-million Pacific Horizon Government Fund and 
the $4.5-billion Pacific Horizon Prime Fund came on top of a $17.4-million 
capital addition the bank made to the Prime Fund earlier this quarter. Taken 
together, the infusions from corporate sources will reduce after-tax earnings 
for the second quarter ended Wednesday by $40 million, the bank said.

 Shiley to Pay $20 Million: Heart valve maker Shiley Inc. and its parent, 
Pfizer Inc., have agreed to pay the federal government $10.75 million to settle 
allegations that it made false claims about potentially fatal artificial 
valves. The amount is what the government estimates it paid for the valves 
through its health insurance programs, Medicare and the Veterans Health 
Administration, multiplied by 2 1/2. The civil suit against Shiley and Pfizer 
was brought under the False Claims Act and common law, which allows the 
government to recoup damages and penalties.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW SLIDES 42 AS INTEREST RATES SURGE; DOLLAR AT LOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Wall Street closed the first half of the year on Thursday with a rout in blue 
chips, as interest rates jumped sharply. But smaller stocks staged a rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar slid to its third consecutive postwar low against the 
Japanese yen amid fears that the major economic powers won't agree on measures 
to support the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, the Dow Jones industrials tumbled 42.09 points to 
3,624.96, in a selloff that keyed off the slumping bond market. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields rocketed across the board, in a selloff reminiscent of the April and 
May turmoil in bonds. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond shot up to 7.60% 
from 7.51% on Wednesday. The yield on five-year T-notes rose to 6.95% from 
6.87%. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields were stoked after the Purchasing Management Assn. of Chicago said 
its index of prices paid by corporate purchasing managers rose to 69.7% in June 
from 63.6% in May -- which bond traders immediately seized upon as a fresh sign 
of mounting inflation in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the survey of the heavily industrial Chicago area is seen as 
providing clues into results of a closely watched national survey due today. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to inflation concerns was an increase in the number of help-wanted ads 
in U.S. newspapers. The Conference Board, a business research group, reported 
its widely watched help-wanted advertising index hit 123 in May, up from 117 in 
April and 100 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 With the weakening dollar already unnerving bond traders, any hints of a 
stronger-than-expected economy -- and thus inflation -- are enough to push the 
market over the edge, analysts warn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board's policy-making committee will meet on Tuesday, and 
bond investors worry that the central bank now will feel compelled to raise 
short-term interest rates for a fifth time this year, both to further restrain 
the economy and to try to support the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the dollar continued its descent. It New York it set at a record 
closing low of 98.55 yen, off from the prior low of 98.60 Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Early today in Tokyo, the dollar broke through 98.00 yen to 97.95. 
</P>
<P>
 But against the German mark, the dollar actually rallied slightly in New York 
on Thursday, to 1.587 marks from 1.584 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the dollar's problems against the yen were conflicting statements 
from American, Japanese and German officials as to whether the currency's 
recent weakness would be discussed at the Group of Seven meeting in Italy next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, meanwhile, traders said Thursday's action was affected by 
end-of-quarter crosscurrents. On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues 
topped advancers by nearly 7 to 5 as blue chip stocks dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Nasdaq market of mostly smaller stocks rallied: Winners topped losers 
by 18 to 10, and the composite index added 1.95 points to 705.96. 
</P>
<P>
 Some traders said bargain hunters were moving into the battered small-stock 
arena on the last day of the quarter. The Nasdaq index, which dropped 4.3% in 
the first quarter, gave up another 5% in the second quarter. The Dow, in 
contrast, lost 3.1% in the first quarter but was off only marginally in the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 George Pirrone, trader at Dreyfus Corp. said some owners of bigger stocks were 
ridding "themselves of stocks they don't want in their portfolios at the end of 
the quarter" on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Such "window dressing" often occurs at the end of quarters, as money managers 
restructure portfolios in time for quarter-end statements that will go to 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Jay Seagle, a technical analyst at Tactics and Technics, said many 
investors had moved to the sidelines ahead of Monday's Independence Day holiday 
and next week's Fed meeting. "This market will be tested to a much truer degree 
next week," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Dow stocks off sharply included Boeing, down 1 to 46 1/4; GE, off 1 to 46 
5/8; IBM, down 1 5/8 to 58 3/4; Caterpillar, off 2 1/8 to 100; and Disney, down 
1 to 41 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many HMO stocks fell after the House Ways and Means Committee OKd a health 
reform bill that could hurt HMOs. United Healthcare sank 2 3/4 to 45 1/8, 
PacifiCare A fell 3 1/8 to 50 and Humana lost 1 3/8 to 16 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the plus side, phone stocks rallied on more merger news. Nynex added 1 to 
37 7/8, GTE gained 3/4 to 31 and Southwestern Bell added 3/8 to 43 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, London's FTSE-100 index dropped 27.1 points to 2,919.2 while the 
Frankfurt's DAX index sank 20.96 points to 2,025.34. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei index rallied, rising 162.93 points to 20,643.93. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index retreated 8.35 points to 2,262.58.

 Income, Spending, Factory Orders Rise: The Commerce Department said Americans' 
personal income rose 0.6% in May -- as it did in April -- boosted by job 
growth, a longer average workweek and higher hourly earnings. Consumer spending 
increased 0.4%, slightly higher than anticipated, after dipping a revised 0.4% 
in April.Spending, accounting for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, 
has risen in 12 of the past 14 months. In the manufacturing sector, the 
department said orders to U.S. factories rose 0.6% in May, following a revised 
0.2% in April. Orders have climbed for three months in a row and in nine of the 
last 10 months. Analysts said the government reports demonstrate that the 
economy expanded at a comfortable pace this spring.

FARMERS WIN IN EPA RULING ON CLEAN GAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a dramatic transformation looms in the composition of gasoline used by 
millions of American drivers in the most polluted U.S. cities -- including Los 
Angeles -- the Clinton Administration Thursday announced that nearly one-third 
of that new gasoline must contain additives, such as grain alcohol, that are 
derived from corn or other renewable sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule, announced by Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol M. 
Browner, takes effect in January.Amendments to the Clean Air Act require that 
by that date, gasoline sold in the nation's nine smoggiest cities must contain 
at least 2% oxygen by weight to promote cleaner burning. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, regulators have debated what sorts of such oxygen-bearing additives 
-- "oxygenates" -- should be used and what percentage of them should be from 
renewable sources. Thursday's ruling calls for at least 15% of oxygenates to 
come from renewable sources during 1995.  
</P>
<P>
 Because the principal renewable source available now in mass quantity is 
ethanol derived from corn, the ruling constitutes a major victory for 
agricultural interests. President Clinton had pledged during the 1992 
presidential campaign to press for expanded use of ethanol in auto fuels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Clinton Administration has a longstanding commitment to developing 
renewable fuels made from corn, grain and other sources of energy," Browner 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The ruling will boost corn demand by 250 million bushels a year and bring at 
least $250 million in additional annual income to farmers, the Administration 
said.

STUDY SEES 25,000 OIL JOBS IF ALASKA EXPORT BAN ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As many as 25,000 new West Coast jobs, most of them in California, could be 
created over the next six years by lifting the federal ban on the export of 
Alaskan crude oil, according to a long-awaited study released Thursday by the 
U.S. Department of Energy. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also estimates that federal and state governments could reap 
hundreds of millions of dollars in new royalties and taxes from increased crude 
oil prices and higher production -- in California and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes a compelling case that . . . the export ban on Alaskan North Slope 
crude is counterproductive," Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
 California oil producers say the two-decade ban forces surplus Alaskan crude 
into the West Coast market, artificially keeping prices below world levels and 
costing oil field jobs in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists, consumer advocates and refiners oppose lifting the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists worry that more West Coast oil production could increase 
efforts to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and California's offshore 
preserves to petroleum exploration.  
</P>
<P>
 Consumer advocates say higher crude oil prices will mean gasoline price hikes. 
Refiners say their facilities can't handle any more California crude oil, which 
is heavier than Alaska's, so they would have to pay more for Alaskan or other 
light crude. 
</P>
<P>
 The Energy Department study found "no significantly negative environmental 
implications" in lifting the ban and no reason to expect higher gas prices. The 
report predicts West Coast refiners could absorb higher crude costs, citing 
refinery profit margins the department calculates at 31% higher than the U.S. 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 The study predicts that lifting the ban would increase total federal revenues 
from taxes, royalties and the sale of federal oil by $99 million to $180 
million from 1994 to 2000. In the same period, Alaska would gain $700 million 
to $1.6 billion; California would receive increased royalties and taxes of $180 
million to $230 million.

 Japan, Germany Urged to Cut Interest Rates: Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen 
appealed to the two nations to help prop up the battered dollar.Lower rates 
would make those nations' currencies less lucrative and thus could lure 
investors back to the dollar. It was the first time Bentsen publicly called on 
those nations to cut interest rates since the dollar's rout began this month. 
His comments heightened speculation that leaders of major industrial nations 
may hatch a strategy to underpin the dollar.

 Century Cable customers in Los Angeles have called to tell us that the news 
about cable rates is even worse than first reported last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Folks in the Sherman Oaks and West Los Angeles franchise areas will see their 
basic and full cable rates go up July 15. They'll also have to pay extra for a 
special converter if they want premium channels, such as HBO or the Disney 
Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, we noted that basic and full cable rates were falling in the East 
Los Angeles franchise territory but that new converter charges ate up the 
savings for premium customers. Century Cable blames the rate changes on new 
federal cable rules. The Federal Communications Commission is requiring cable 
firms to base rates on a formula that takes into account demographic 
information, the age of the cable system and other factors. Before this latest 
round of changes, Los Angeles residents paid the same price regardless of where 
they lived. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no choice," a Century Cable spokeswoman said of the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Century Cable customers are also upset about channel shuffling. For example, 
Century Cable has shifted Cable News Network to Channel 39 from 19. 
Full-service customers with older, 36-channel TV sets won't be able to continue 
viewing CNN without either leasing a converter or buying a new television. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very unfair," said Ian Smith, a Century Cable customer in Tarzana. "I 
really feel for older people without much money who like to watch CNN." 
</P>
<P>
 Other customers with older TVs complained that TBS is being shifted to Channel 
66 from 23. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Century Cable said the company shuffled some channels to 
alleviate transmission difficulties. Family Channel, a new offering, is going 
to Channel 19. A preview guide, also new, will appear on Channel 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Century Cable must submit the changes to the city's telecommunications office 
for review within 30 days.

 What price notoriety: Forget the stock market. Forget derivatives. For pure 
speculation, there's nothing like O.J. Simpson memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 Asking prices for Simpson trading cards and autographed footballs have climbed 
more than tenfold in the wake of the football legend's arrest on charges of 
murdering his former wife and her friend. Trading card asking prices range from 
$300 to $1,500 -- amounts one expert termed "outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfathomable that it has that kind of value," said Joie Casey, president 
of Field of Dreams sports memorabilia stores. "Anyone paying those prices is 
being taken advantage of." 
</P>
<P>
 Low-budget speculators are snapping up cards depicting ex-football player Al 
Cowlings, a Simpson friend and the man at the wheel during the low-speed police 
chase that ended with the arrest of both men at the Simpson estate in 
Brentwood. Casey said he sold nearly 100 Cowlings cards -- his entire stock -- 
at $1 apiece. They usually go for 50 cents.

 Safety testing: The Consumer Products Safety Commission has expanded its 
search for potential toxins in children's art materials to chalk, watercolors 
and markers. 
</P>
<P>
 The move follows the April recall of 11 brands of imported crayons containing 
lead. Lead poisoning can lead to learning disabilities in children. Crayons 
involved in the recall were manufactured in China. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency is testing more than 50 brands of children's art supplies for the 
presence of lead and other toxic substances. The supplies were imported from 
Mexico, Taiwan, Indonesia and several European countries. The commission is not 
testing U.S.-made products, but has asked American manufacturers to submit 
results of testing performed by an outside laboratory. A commission spokesman 
said the agency's testing results are not yet available.

<P>
 Cutting out junk mail: A state law taking effect today requires credit card 
issuers to give cardholders a chance to delete their names from mailing lists 
sold to marketing companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Some credit card issuers sell lists of customer names to marketing companies 
targeting consumers based on their income or spending habits. The law prevents 
credit card issuers from sharing information without customers' permission. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevan Allen, spokesman for Assemblyman Sal Cannella (D-Ceres), author of the 
law, said consumers should receive by today "opt-out" notices from card 
companies that share customer lists, allowing them to delete their names. 
</P>
<P>
 If you haven't received such a notice, it could be because your card issuer 
doesn't share its customer list. It is also possible that your card issuer has 
already given you a chance to scratch your name from its marketing lists, Allen 
said. Century Cable Rates

 Los Angeles residents' rates for cable service will vary depending on where 
they live under changes that take effect July 15. A look at the changes for the 
city's three franchise areas compared to the current citywide monthly rate:

THE BIZ / KATHRYN HARRIS: COMPANY TOWN; NETWORKS MAY BE RIPE FOR PICKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Nearly a decade ago, all three major networks changed hands within 15 months. 
Now media executives are debating whether the proposed merger of CBS Inc. and 
QVC Inc. will smoke out new bidders -- either for CBS itself, or for its Big 
Three brethren, NBC and Capital Cities/ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the hype over multimedia, old-fashioned networks have regained their 
luster because they deliver the broadest audience to advertisers and own hugely 
profitable stations in the biggest markets. But the list of potential suitors 
is shorter than many people might imagine because of stringent legal curbs on 
ownership by foreign companies and cable TV operators. 
</P>
<P>
 As CBS Chairman Laurence A. Tisch noted Thursday, "We've had no serious 
overtures from other buyers, but we weren't seeking overtures." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one major Hollywood studio owner -- Walt Disney Co. -- is viewed as a 
prospective suitor, because it is not encumbered by massive debt and ownership 
conflicts. But sources say Disney Chairman Michael D. Eisner, who worked with 
QVC Chairman Barry Diller first at ABC and then at Paramount, is unlikely to 
engage in a bidding war for CBS, out of friendship for Diller and his 
well-known reluctance to overpay for an asset. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would definitely (bid for a network) at the right price, but his concept 
of the right price is very different," one Eisner friend said Thursday. The 
Disney chairman himself was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Cap Cities and Disney are often viewed by Wall Street and Hollywood executives 
as an ideal match, but there was no evidence Thursday of business talks. 
Indeed, one source said Cap Cities is seriously considering a bid for Ziff 
Publishing, which would be a $2-billion investment far removed from the tinsel 
of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal law prohibits a company with more than 25% foreign ownership from 
obtaining a broadcast license. That rule in effect eliminates Sony Pictures, 
Matsushita's MCA Corp. and the Credit Lyonnais-controlled Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer 
Inc., as well as Montreal-based Seagram Co., which has shown an appetite for 
media with its 15% stake in Time Warner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An equal problem is posed for companies that have cable TV operators as large 
-- or intractable -- shareholders, because the Federal Communications 
Commission bars ownership of cable TV systems and TV stations in the same 
market. Sources said Turner Broadcasting System recently tried to pursue talks 
to acquire NBC but was hamstrung by opposition from Time Warner Inc., the 
nation's second-largest cable TV operator and a 19% shareholder in Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 QVC has some of the same cable TV shareholders -- namely Time Warner, 
Tele-Communications Inc. and Comcast Corp. -- but has structured its deal to 
reduce their voting stake to 5% in the post-merger CBS, to comply with an 
ownership limit set by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Media executives Thursday raised doubts that Turner would revive its NBC 
effort, since it would result in big cable companies such as TCI and Time 
Warner having a stake in two of the nation's leading broadcast networks. A 
Turner spokeswoman declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, four top media executives predicted that the other two networks will 
change hands or find merger partners in the next three years. General Electric 
would be willing to sell NBC for more than $4 billion, industry sources said, 
while Cap Cities/ABC is on the prowl for big acquisitions that might result in 
a new management succession. 
</P>
<P>
 Cap Cities/ABC Chairman Thomas S. Murphy, 68, returned to the chief 
executive's post early this year when 65-year-old Daniel B. Burke stuck to his 
plans to retire. Although a number of Hollywood executives believe that Cap 
Cities Executive Vice President Robert A. Iger is being groomed for the job, 
not all outsiders are convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ironically, many of the issues that are receiving headlines today were issues 
that the networks were dealing with eight years ago," said Stuart N. Brotman, a 
Lexington, Mass.-based management consultant who served as a telecommunications 
adviser in the Carter Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NBC changed hands in 1985 because it was an RCA subsidiary caught up in a 
friendly, $6.28-billion sale to GE. Earlier that same year, American 
Broadcasting Cos. was sold to Capital Cities Communications for $3.5 billion, 
in part because ABC founder Leonard Goldenson was searching for a strong 
management team. 
</P>
<P>
 "And CBS had to adjust to a post-Paley environment," Brotman said, alluding to 
a parade of executives who were chosen -- and then rejected -- by the late CBS 
founder William Paley until Loews Chairman Laurence Tisch acquired effective 
control in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Tisch has not demonstrated such fitfulness, the 71-year-old executive 
had no chief operating officer nor family member who wished to succeed him. 
"The family is very supportive of this deal. They have great respect for Barry 
Diller," the CBS chairman declared Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Insta-suit: It didn't take long for someone to challenge the CBS-QVC union. 
Two CBS Inc. shareholders, Sue Kahn and Eli Wechsler, Thursday sued in New York 
State Supreme Court to block the proposed merger. The stockholders charge that 
the merger would shortchange them by undervaluing their CBS shares. Tisch and 
Diller, who are also named in the suit, are accused of breaching their 
fiduciary duty to by failing to auction off CBS' assets or independently 
evaluate them.

 Letterman's Top 10 Ways CBS Will Be Different After Merging With QVC (From 
Thursday's "Late Show With David Letterman"): 
</P>
<P>
 10. You know that stopwatch on "60 Minutes"? It's yours for $49.95!

<P>
 9. Many things will change, but Connie Chung will still be married to that 
dweeb Maury. 
</P>
<P>
 8. I'll get paid in cubic zirconias. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Once per episode of "Murder, She Wrote," Jessica will look right at the 
camera and yell, "We've got blenders for sale!" 
</P>
<P>
 6. Fox executives will be able to call in and buy whatever sports CBS has 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 5. The CBS "eye" logo and QVC "chipmunk" logo will be combined into a spooky 
eye-chipmunk creature. 
</P>
<P>
 4. No matter what, we'll still be working for TV weasels. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Little number in corner of screen will go up every time Bob Barker scores. 
</P>
<P>
 2. During the evening news, Dan Rather sells (his) pants. 
</P>

 1. Goodby "Tiffany network" -- hello "Kmart network."

COMPANY TOWN; EU FILM, TV LEADERS MEET TO TRY TO SAVE THE INDUSTRY; TRADE: THEY 
GATHER TO DISCUSS RESTRUCTURING THE BELEAGUERED BUSINESS IN THE FACE OF 
HOLLYWOOD'S ENCROACHMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a mood of apprehension and uncertainty, 300 leading figures from Western 
Europe's entertainment industry convened here Thursday to confront a problem 
that won't go away: Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 They came to the three-day European Audio Visual Conference to search for ways 
to revive and reshape the region's beleaguered film and television business, 
after being battered for years by the growing strength of their American 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Delegates are expected to work from a series of proposals from EU Cultural 
Affairs Commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro for restructuring the industry. They 
will also discuss possible changes in a controversial 5-year-old EU directive 
governing television programming content in the region. Although the issue is 
not new, a sense of urgency has gripped Europeans that unless they invoke 
changes now, the entire industry could be doomed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hollywood, which derives roughly half its overall box office revenue from 
foreign markets, executives are battling to maintain their foothold. 
Representatives from the Motion Picture Assn. of America and the American Film 
Marketing Assn. have argued against protectionism in a series of meetings with 
their European counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the combination of the recent world trade agreement, which has severely 
weakened protections everywhere, and the implications of new technologies and a 
"global information society" have convinced many Europeans that they must go on 
the offensive or give up. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent report on the status of the industry commissioned by the EU, known as 
the Think Tank Report, sketches out the decline. 
</P>
<P>
 In cryptic fashion it notes: 
</P>
<P>
 * In 10 years, European films have lost 50% of the theater movie market. 
</P>
<P>
 * In 15 years, European films have largely become money losers. 
</P>
<P>
 * American films are the only ones that play well throughout Europe.  
</P>
<P>
 * The explosion of video has intensified American domination. 
</P>
<P>
 * The liberalization of television in Europe has increased the dependence of 
the stations on American productions. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate report issued by EU Executive Commission President Jacques Delors 
in December notes that American movies are mainly responsible for Western 
Europe's brisk 6% annual growth rate in the audiovisual sector, with revenue 
from U.S. films rising from $330 million in 1984 to $3.6 billion in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our fundamental political option is either to . . . create efficient 
industries that match our ambitions or to give up and take the economic and 
cultural consequences that lack of action would entail," said Pinheiro, who is 
the host of the conference. " . . . Implementation of a European policy for the 
program industry is therefore most urgent. We must act now."  
</P>
<P>
 Last fall's bruising General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks and stubborn 
economic troubles in Europe have also brought an important new dimension to the 
meetings -- the voice of a pragmatic constituency that has come to view 
Europe's film industry not solely as a cultural treasure, but also as a 
commercial industry that needs to be made more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 This view first came to light in March, when another senior EU cultural 
affairs official, Colette Flesch, told a group of film industry officials that 
"Americans have taught us that motion pictures are an industry and exports are 
crucial . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 In this respect, there appeared to be a broadening awareness that in order to 
survive, European directors and producers need to become more responsive to 
market demands and needs and that Europe's film industry can no longer afford 
to subsidize productions that never reach an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make more mainstream pictures," said Andres Vicente Gomez, 
president of Spain's Ibero Americana Film Produccion. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, Gomez and others gave no impression they want to 
cut either the $500 million in subsidies doled out annually to European 
filmmakers or to phase out a controversial quota system that requires that at 
least half of television transmission time in EU countries be devoted to 
European works. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the EU's discussion document for the industry's future calls for a 
series of subsidies and other supports to assist a major restructuring, and the 
producers group Eurocinema recently proposed a five-year, $1.8-billion 
injection of government money to support the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The influential Think Tank Report also warns, "The quota would be wasted 
entirely if it simply allowed broadcasters to show American drama during prime 
time and to dump European material into the more marginal segments of the 
schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 During the three-day conference, the industry leaders are also expected to 
review ways to improve Europe's inefficient film distribution system and break 
down intra-European cultural barriers that keep films made in one member 
country from showing in another.

 Multimedia: MGM/UA became the latest studio to jump on the "You've seen the 
movie, now play the CD-ROM" bandwagon Thursday, announcing plans for an 
interactive game based on "Blown Away," an action film that opens today. 
Imagination Pilots, a Chicago-based multimedia software firm, is creating the 
game.The venture is separate from the deal the studio announced earlier this 
year to develop games with Sega of America Inc. As the market for interactive 
software expands, entertainment companies have rushed to use the medium as a 
way to make more money from their productions. The problem is, a good movie 
doesn't necessarily make a good game. And game development -- which can cost as 
much as $2 million -- usually starts before the movie comes out. If the film 
bombs, the game usually does too. The "Blown Away" game, due out this fall, 
will incorporate explosion scenes from the movie. But the real race among the 
studios is to finish a game in time for the movie's theatrical release. Sony is 
hoping to get its "Frankenstein" game out in November for simultaneous release 
with the TriStar film. Fox plans to do the same for "Pagemaster." AMY HARMON

COMEDY WITHOUT A NET; STUDENTS AT TWO WORKSHOPS LEARN THAT THERE ARE RULES FOR 
SUCCESS IN THE HIGH-WIRE ART OF IMPROV. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Robert Koehler writes regularly about 
theater for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If, as Steve Martin says, comedy isn't pretty, then improv comedy is a horror. 
The act of getting on stage with no script, no preparation time and absolutely 
no mercy from the audience is only slightly less dangerous than a high-wire act 
without a net. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet improv comedy is commonly perceived as date-night-lite material, somewhere 
far down the entertainment food chain -- below movies, music clubs, even 
stand-up. Nevertheless, it is perhaps the most elusive stage art. (One improv 
actor jokes that baseball hitters have a better success average than he does.) 
The actor or comic who masters improv may have the key advantage in the always 
fiercely competitive TV, film and theater markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always tell any actor starting out to learn improv," says theater, film and 
TV director Robert Ginty. "Improv is where you master your fears of doing 
anything in front of an audience. You get that under your control, and you feel 
like you can do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Although there may be plenty of places to experience improv in a city stuffed 
with clubs and companies, there are far fewer places to learn it. And in the 
San Fernando Valley, there are only two independent improv workshops not 
directly tied in with a producing company. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Acme Comedy School in North Hollywood, and The Coolsters comedy 
improvisation workshop in Toluca Lake, two very different approaches to 
high-wire improv suggest that, as with just about everything, there is more 
than one way to attack a problem. The enduring problem for the improv performer 
begins this way: Now that I'm on stage, where do I go from here? 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 students in Cynthia Szigeti's Saturday morning introductory improv 
class at Acme Comedy Theatre are giddily joking with each other. But since this 
is week six of a 12-week course, they know they're about to be sent through 
some rigorous paces. 
</P>
<P>
 In minutes, Szigeti, a friendly but commanding teacher and veteran of the 
Groundlings comedy group, has the class doing a surprising warm-up exercise: 
Miming a tug-of-war match, each side plays out a game of give-and-take, 
tug-and-pull. It's more difficult than it sounds, with Szigeti explaining that 
it's really about the essence of group improv, "as much about surrender as it 
is about assertiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 Szigeti describes most of the workshop exercises in similarly esoteric terms: 
"information is the lifeblood of scenes," and "a denial stops a scene" and "pay 
attention that you're capable of emotional adjustment." Translation? "It's 
listening," she says, or in the case of denial, not listening. "People! If you 
say 'no' to the other character's question, you stop everything!" she reminds 
the class. 
</P>
<P>
 In a grueling and sometimes embarrassing exercise, four students form a 
face-forward line and begin chanting in simple childlike rhythm. The rhythm 
sets a verse line, like iambic pentameter, and the first student makes up a 
line. The following three must immediately make up others. Oh, and they have to 
rhyme. 
</P>
<P>
 Szigeti acknowledges that she's more technical than most improv teachers. "But 
it's like this: There are rules. Some teachers just tell their students to go 
up there, do a scene, but they really don't know what to do. But the rules like 
not saying 'no,' or always noticing a physical gesture or verbal and emotional 
offering -- those are firm."  
</P>
<P>
 For all those reasons, Szigeti encourages her class to watch basketball 
players and jazz musicians at work. But she also passes out a list of L.A. 
comedy clubs, so the novices can study the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it happens to be in his theater, Acme Artistic Director M.D. Sweeney 
doesn't view the improv school, which opened in April, as feeding talent into 
Acme Comedy Theatre's current three teams of performers. "Some of them," he 
says of the students, "may go on to the intermediate class starting in 
mid-to-late July (a date is yet to be announced), some may go on to our groups, 
and others won't go on at all. We want only professional actors who want to 
hone their improvising skills." 
</P>
<P>
 "Even great actors like Lynn Redgrave, whom I've coached in improv," says 
Szigeti, "can be so uptight about this. But keep this in mind: Every hour of 
every day, we're always improvising. Life is one big improv. Think about it. 
Then this doesn't feel like you're about to die." 
</P>
<P>
 But on a Tuesday night, other young students -- in The Coolsters comedy 
improvisation workshop -- look as if they do feel like dying. They're working 
in a converted dance studio at writer-producer Topper ("Martin") Carew's Toluca 
Lake headquarters, under the watchful eye of teacher and veteran comic Cal 
Gibson. And they're receiving a strong dose of how "getting" improv is like 
grabbing hold of a slippery eel. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps as important, these mostly minority students are in a room where 
they're no longer the minority, with the chance to play a range of characters 
and situations. "You can get the minority points of view in this class," Gibson 
says. "When minority performers are in a predominantly Anglo class, they're 
often forced to play minority roles, and that usually means playing 
stereotypes." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson, more an encouraging coach than a technique teacher here, divides the 
session into two parts: First, one-on-one scenes. Tonight's are set in a 
department store's exchange department, with one student playing the clerk and 
the other the customer. Second are group scenes -- afternoon chat shows are 
tonight's pick. 
</P>
<P>
 The department store setting comes with a catch. Students in the audience 
decide what item the customer is returning while the customer is out of the 
room. He or she must listen during the improv to clues from the exchange clerk 
character. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as with the second group scene, in which four or five actors cook up a 
talk-show situation, listening is crucial. That, and energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Coolster Ande Richards: "When that energy level drops, you just feel like 
you're losing it. Cal is really great stressing never to flag or lose momentum. 
The trick is not thinking too hard about being funny." 
</P>
<P>
 The talk-show exercise is also designed to invent characters. "File those 
people away," Gibson urges his class, "and you can pull them out when you need 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 As a TV comedy creator, workshop founder Carew champions characters, and he's 
excited about another part of this project: The Coolsters comedy group, which 
recently played its first eight-week engagement at The Comedy Store's small 
Belly Room. 
</P>
<P>
 Carew promises future live Coolsters shows, although dates and venues have not 
been set, and with some financial support from HBO and Carew's TV projects, the 
Coolsters group and workshops may be the start of a cottage industry. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; ADDING DEPTH TO ARTIST'S LIFE; THE BIOGRAPHICAL DRAMA DRAWS ON 
THE TENSION BETWEEN ALBERT P. RYDER'S LOVE OF NATURE AND HIS HERMETIC 
EXISTENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 What a strange painter Albert P. Ryder was. What a strange little play "Ryder" 
is. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the miniature oils of impassioned land scapes, cloudscapes and allegories 
this turn-of- the-century American painter produced with obsessively slow 
deliberation, Michael Holmes' biographical portrait at the Chandler Studio 
builds layer upon layer of emotion in a tiny space. And like Ryder himself, it 
is almost self-consciously Quixotic, truly determined to create rich drama out 
of a solitary painter's life, even as a host of previous artist plays and films 
suggest how nearly impossible that is. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the only two recent successful dramas about art-making -- Jacques 
Rivette's "La Belle Noiseuse" and Peter Greenaway's "The Belly of an Architect" 
-- work because the former devotes long stretches of playing time to the act of 
painting, while the latter is shot amid the actual architecture of Rome. 
"Ryder" has neither the time nor the space for any kind of you-are-there 
biography. 
</P>
<P>
 Because nearly all of Ryder's work was painted on such small surfaces as cigar 
box lids, and because his early years are virtually undocumented, Holmes' jobs 
as both adapter and director were fairly awesome. Imagine the turbulent colors, 
glows and movement of J.M.W. Turner's sky paintings mixed with the dark eddies 
and disturbances of Edvard Munch's art, and one might get a sense of this 
obscure painter's opus. 
</P>
<P>
 But Turner's and Munch's canvases are nearly as large as their lives; Ryder's 
life was so unadventurous that he didn't even do much of the then-obligatory 
European touring. In a reverse of the usual life-to-stage adaptation, Holmes 
has had to expand on this man's life rather than trim away detail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ryder" becomes a tale of the tension between an artist's love of gigantic 
nature and his own hermetic, claustrophobic existence in a trash-filled New 
York apartment. Surrounding him at various stages is a small set of wildly 
different friends, from the tragic Christopher (Steve Evans) who helped inspire 
perhaps Ryder's most distinctive and disturbing work, "The Race Track," to 
seaman Capt. Robinson (Rob Daniel) to New Yorkers Charles and Louise 
Fitzpatrick (James Michael Connor and Susan Savage) who look after Ryder like 
parents visiting a destitute son. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Joseph Dean Vachon as Ryder, most of the play takes place 
during the time when Ryder almost too easily fit the stereotype of the 
half-crazed, tortured artist. Vachon gives a glimpse of the younger man and his 
rebellious New England nature. But for too much of the play he must flail about 
stage talking to himself, nervously pacing, kicking around debris and emitting 
a hyena-like laugh that's too actorish by half. This is physically stunning 
stuff, but self-consciously so. 
</P>
<P>
 It also doesn't make up for not being able to view Ryder's paintings, which 
here are carefully reproduced but tiny props. Only a camera close-up might 
allow us a view (though, at the end, "The Race Track" becomes visible as it's 
hung on a wall). Thus, it's a stretch for the audience to grasp that Ryder is a 
dynamic original, in the rank of Winslow Homer. 
</P>
<P>
 At other times, Holmes inserts superbly surprising scenes, as when Ryder is 
aboard Robinson's ship, when we can imagine nature's immensity nearly driving 
the painter to tears. "Ryder" might be screaming to be a film, but it contains 
enough moments on stage to suggest the artist's inner turmoil, if not his outer 
world. WHERE AND WHEN

WINDING TRAIL TO THE STAGE; POST-CIVIL WAR STORY OF A TEXAS FAMILY, WRITTEN IN 
1979, IS HAVING ITS PROFESSIONAL PREMIERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Robert Koehler writes regularly about 
theater for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Chisholm Trail actually did run through the flat, vast North Texas 
farmland where playwright Brady Thomas was born in the early 1950s. Thus, even 
the title of Thomas' play -- "The Chisholm Trail Went Through Here," opening 
tonight at the Road Theatre -- suggests the deep roots of her family saga in a 
fading West. 
</P>
<P>
 And like the winding 19th-Century cattle route that stretched from the 
southern reaches of the Lone Star State to the railroad at Abilene, Kan., the 
route of Thomas' "Chisholm Trail" from page to stage has been long and 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Thomas wrote her play while she was a graduate student in UCLA's 
theater arts program in 1979, the Road is hosting its professional world 
premiere. "We couldn't believe that it hadn't been done by another professional 
theater," says director and Road co-artistic director Taylor Gilbert. "It's 
just too strong a piece not to have been produced before. So, I guess we're 
lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky, and with the right connection: Gilbert's Road partner, Brad Hills, had 
known about "Chisholm Trail" for a long time, since he too had attended UCLA's 
theater program. He's kept his eye on the script, he says, ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, though, had to live with what she describes as the "crazy" treatment 
of her script since it was staged twice in UCLA student productions. 
</P>
<P>
 With the bustle of the first tech rehearsal day buzzing around her as she sits 
in the Road's business office, Thomas tells a history that could stand as a 
cautionary tale for any would-be playwright. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt pressure to write something commercial, which then meant like Neil 
Simon or some kind of New York apartment drama," she says. "I tried that, and 
my teacher hated it. I was desperate to come up with something for the class, 
but the only idea I had was something I'd thought of as a multi-generational 
Texas farmland novel, starting after the Civil War and ending during the oil 
wildcat days after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "My teacher liked this, but I couldn't imagine how I could contain so many 
visual elements and shove them into the single setting of a farmhouse kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
 The "dusty windows" of this kitchen, as Thomas describes them in her play 
notes, "offer a view of emptiness." The land of the Rucker family farm couldn't 
support cattle in 1947, a time of great transition, Thomas says, when the old 
cattle-ranching ways had collapsed and the wartime industry had swept people 
off the land and into nearby cities like Fort Worth. (Ironically, years later, 
that very wealth helped resuscitate cattle ranching in the region.) 
</P>
<P>
 The playwright, born near Decatur, Tex., drew upon her relatives for her broad 
range of characters -- from stalwart Mae ("She is my grandmother") and 
eccentric, hard-of-hearing Josie to clashing brothers Bryan and Buck. 
Throughout the intertwining plots, Mae witnesses almost all the family members 
leave the farm, including her cherished young niece, Jo Beth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Except for Mae and Josie," says Thomas, "I changed names and made composite 
characters, but I knew these people like they're in my blood. Their like will 
never be here again." That sense of a lost era, she realizes, links her closely 
with author Larry McMurtry ("The Last Picture Show"), whose literary Texas 
territory lies just west of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I always saw this as a comedy, but then during the UCLA 
productions, I saw audience members crying. It seemed that they were crying for 
Mae, her desire to hang on even when Buck declares that 'this land is sick.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas now openly regrets that she devoted more than a decade to graduate work 
and university teaching at Washington State, New York's Hamilton College and 
the University of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me much too far away from writing, because when you teach theater and 
directing, you're in class all day, and in the theater all night," she says. 
"It didn't make it any easier having had professional credits in acting (at 
Houston's Alley Theatre and San Diego's Old Globe), because students would come 
to me for advice, and other academics would become jealous." 
</P>
<P>
 Things didn't go any more smoothly for her play. After the UCLA shows, 
"Chisholm Trail" was snatched up by the Manhattan Theatre Club as part of a 
workshop production festival. "I had deliberately constructed the play 
musically, with slow passages as relief. But I was shy and not very aggressive, 
and I didn't fight back when the workshop directors wanted the slow stuff cut 
-- 'Just to see how it works,' they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, all they had then were the fast parts, and they told me it was too 
late to reinsert the cut scenes. That's when I learned how playwrights are 
rewritten and usurped, despite what every playwright is told about 'owning your 
play.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas says she feels much safer at the Road. Her play is being done intact, 
"with some trimming here and there -- and let me tell you, it needed it!" she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Its familial core is "right at the heart of what we want to do at this 
theater," says Gilbert, who cites a string of past Road Theatre family plays 
such as "Vig" and "The Walkers" as part of the group's focus on ensemble 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's wonderful in Brady's writing," Gilbert adds, "is that it looks 
backward to a real heartland spirit, and also forward, to the themes of 
poisoning the land and greed. And she also constructs a full story for every 
one of her (11) characters. You don't see that very often on a stage." Where

COVER STORY; THE BUTCHER'S ART; ADD SOME SPICE TO YOUR FOURTH OF JULY BY 
GRILLING A BATCH OF SPECIALTY SAUSAGES -- FROM CHORIZO TO KIELBASA TO BRATWURST

 If you fire up the barbecue this weekend you may be engaging in a tradition 
that stretches back to the ancient Greeks. Homer's "Odyssey," written in 850 
B.C., describes cooking "sausages over a scorching blaze." 
</P>
<P>
 Less nobly, they are called hot dogs, frankfurters, bangers or meat sticks. 
They come in thick tire-shaped tubes, marble-sized nuggets and dainty 
ladyfinger links, and can be made of pork, chicken, beef, duck, turkey, potato 
or even fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Culinary historians believe sausages are the oldest way to preserve meats, and 
they are a part of nearly every culture. Pick any sausage -- Italian pepperoni, 
German bratwurst or Mexican chorizo -- and it will mirror the tastes of a part 
of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, butcher shops reflect their ethnic heritage by 
making sausages fresh daily, so there is no reason to worry about the nitrates 
and preservatives in mass-produced hot dogs. A controversial recent USC study, 
which linked eating more than a dozen hot dogs a month with an increased risk 
of childhood leukemia, could nudge consumers into giving fresher alternatives a 
try. Buying from these stores may cost a few cents more, but the sausage-makers 
-- who are almost religious about their calling -- say you will get a fresher, 
tastier and healthier sausage. 
</P>
<P>
 Sausage-making is the "highest level of the butcher's art," says Bruce 
Aidells, owner and chef of the Aidells Sausage Co. in San Francisco. 
"Sausage-eaters are very experimental. 
</P>
<P>
 "The great thing about sausages is that if you have a good one, you've got an 
instant meal," Aidells says. "They can be in a pasta, a soup, or you can eat 
them by themselves." Aidells has chronicled American heritage through (what 
else?) sausage-making -- all the while encouraging people to try new sausages 
-- in his "Hot Links and Country Flavors" (Alfred A. Knopf Inc., 1990). 
</P>
<P>
 On this, the traditional hot-dog weekend, it may be time to put aside the 
Oscar Mayers and try Fat Harold's Bulk Sausage or buffalo jalapeno, or any 
number of dozens of fresh sausages available across the Valley. ANTHONY'S OLD 
FASHIONED MEAT 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Monaco has "been in the business since age 8," he says, when he would 
help make sausages at his father's butcher shop in Queens, N.Y.  
</P>
<P>
 Business has been good for Monaco -- his Woodland Hills store has been open 
for 20 years, and a second store in Northridge opened about two years ago. The 
original store shares space with Rick's Seafood Emporium, where owner Rick 
Rittner contributes a sausage to the huge list that hangs on Monaco's back 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Customers kept asking for a fish sausage, so one day I did it," Rittner says. 
"I make it out of what's available -- red snapper, swordfish, Atlantic cod." 
While Monaco makes a tasty lamb and basil link, his best-selling creation is 
Italian pork sausage. "It's what I take home to my wife," he says. "She won't 
let me in the door without it." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony's Old Fashioned Meat, 9129 Reseda Blvd., Northridge, and 19822 Ventura 
Blvd., Woodland Hills. Open 10 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday through Sunday. 
Woodland Hills, (818) 884-6666. Northridge, (818) 993-1950. HOLIDAY MEATS 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Bogash left a high-paying property management job two years ago to join 
the family business to "make sausage. That's what I truly love to do," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogash runs Holiday Meats with his brother Michael and father, Harold, who 
will retire soon but plans to come in at least two days a week to make sausage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our Louisiana-style andouille sausage is awesome," Mark Bogash says of the 
specialty meat that he often uses in jambalaya and cioppino. New on their list 
of 23 sausages is a turkey wiener that's 95% fat-free. Their oldest fare is 
"Fat Harold's Bulk Sausage," which Dad has been making since he opened the shop 
in 1963. "It's a blend of hot and mild Italian sausage and herbs. People use it 
for everything, from breakfast sausage to dinner meats," Mark Bogash says. 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday Meats, 8344 Topanga Canyon Blvd., Canoga Park. Open 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
Monday through Saturday, (818) 884-1025. ALPENA SAUSAGE 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Thaller remembers the time at Ma Maison when Orson Wells introduced 
Thaller as his personal sausage-maker. "He was particularly fond of our chicken 
apple breakfast sausage," Thaller recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most sausage-makers, Thaller learned his craft from his father, back in 
his Austrian homeland. "I am European-trained, but I've converted old recipes 
into today's demand," Thaller says, citing his fresh chicken and turkey with 
sun-dried tomatoes, which he makes exclusively for Trader Joe's. Alpena has 
been around since 1967, but Thaller stopped selling retail three years ago to 
concentrate on his wholesale business. Find his chicken and turkey wieners at 
Mrs. Gooch's stores and pick up his other sausage creations at Bristol Farms, 
Jons and Gelson's markets. ATLAS SAUSAGE KITCHEN 
</P>
<P>
 "Every sausage we sell comes from this smokehouse," says Michael Obermayer, 
owner of Atlas Sausage Kitchen. "Doesn't it smell wonderful in here?" Atlas is 
the granddaddy of Los Angeles homemade wursts -- the store has been around for 
50 years, and the original wooden smokehouse still cures Atlas links. Obermayer 
creates such Austro-Hungarian delights as fat Munich-style weisswurst and smoky 
Hungarian Kolbasz. 
</P>
<P>
 Obermayer studied sausage-making in his native Bavaria (and later in Chicago) 
before taking the helm at Atlas 15 years ago. His pleased customers keep 
coming, even after they've moved. "We have people drive from San Diego, Santa 
Barbara and Phoenix for our sausages," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlas Sausage Kitchen, 10626 Burbank Blvd., North Hollywood. Open 10 a.m. to 3 
p.m. Monday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Saturday, (818) 763-2692. EUROPEAN MEAT SPECIALTIES 
</P>
<P>
 Open the door to this little bit of Ukraine and step into a world of flavorful 
garlic, cumin and caraway smells. On crowded Saturday afternoons, you can 
barely hear English spoken at this Eastern-European market, where owner Mike 
Rayevsky will gladly give you a huge sample of his daily sausage specials. "We 
do over 50 types of sausages. That's about 2,000 pounds of sausage daily," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 He is especially proud of his Krakow salami, Soviet sausage and wide 
assortment of blood sausages. "When you think about it, sausages are the soul 
food of Eastern Europe," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 European Meat Specialties, 12926 Saticoy St., No. 12, North Hollywood. Open 8 
a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday, (818) 982-2325. JODY MARONI SAUSAGES 
</P>
<P>
 Jody Maroni calls his sausages "haute dogs," because his 14 kinds defy 
traditional recipes. "We put a California twist on the old-fashioned wiener," 
says the self-proclaimed sausage king of Venice Beach and now CityWalk. The son 
of a butcher from Studio City, Maroni started his business 15 years ago, and he 
thinks he's lured skeptics back to sausage.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our sausages are very healthy. In fact, our chicken Italian sausage is only 
11% fat," he says. Maroni creations include Moroccan lamb, chicken and duck 
with basil, orange-garlic-cumin sausage, and Bombay bangers. Look for Maroni's 
Yucatan sausage at local Trader Joe's stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Jody Maroni Sausages, Universal CityWalk, Universal City. Open 10 a.m. to 11 
p.m. Monday through Sunday, (818) 622-5639. In Venice, at 2011 Oceanfront Walk. 
Open 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Sunday. (310) 306-1995. To place a mail 
order, call (800) HAUT-DOG. CONTINENTAL GOURMET SAUSAGE CO. 
</P>
<P>
 An impressive array of framed awards hangs on the back wall of Eugen Goetz's 
store, which he took over five years ago. He has turned this unassuming local 
operation into an internationally known label, with more than 26 awards from 
the California Assn. of Meat Processors. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sausages have broken records -- they even know me in Germany," Goetz says 
as he shows off his Grand Champion Schweizer Bockwurst, Thuringer Blutwurst and 
other sausages in the refrigerator cases. He bought the place to see if he 
could re-create what he learned as a sausage-maker 26 years ago in his German 
homeland. "I guess once you know something it always comes back to you," he 
says. "I surprised even myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Continental Gourmet Sausage Co . , 6406 San Fernando Road, Glendale. Open 9 
a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday, (818) 502-1447. SCHREINER'S FINE 
SAUSAGES 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Bison of Burbank remembers going to Schreiner's as a child in the '60s 
and watching her grandmother pick out links of juicy knackwurst and Leberwurst. 
Today, her family still shops at Schreiner's for their twice-a-year family 
feast. 
</P>

 Owner Walter Schreiner, now 85, has been overseeing the production of sausages 
for 40 years, along with his son Walter, 63, and grandson Walter, 33. 
</P>
<P>
 Their ethnically diverse sausage list includes Italian linguica, fresh 
chorizo, Swedish potato sausage and chicken bratwurst with jalapeno. 
Schreiner's luncheonette serves German delights along with sausage sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 Schreiner's Fine Sausages, 3417 Ocean View Blvd., Glendale. Open 9 a.m. to 
5:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday, (818) 244-4735. HARMONY FARMS 
</P>
<P>
 When Bruce Oxford was a child living on the North Dakota plains, his tasty 
jack rabbit sausage used to impress the old-timers. Now, 45 years later, Los 
Angelenos can sample such Oxford sausages as lamb basil, turkey with apples or 
exotic buffalo jalapeno. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxford has been selling what he calls "good, old-fashioned meat" all his life. 
He praises his South Dakota buffalo meat -- "as a health food, you just can't 
beat it" -- because, he says, it is lower in cholesterol and fat than any other 
red meat. Harmony Farms meats are at selected health food stores, but his 
homemade sausages are sold only at his retail outlet. (There's no jack rabbit 
on the menu though.) 
</P>
<P>
 Harmony Farms, 2824 Foothill Blvd., La Crescenta. Open 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday 
through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday, (818) 248-3068. VONS PAVILIONS 
STORES 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, three local Vons Pavilions stores have had full-time 
sausage-makers churning out daily batches of kielbasa, Irish potato and creamy 
veal sausage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of providing homemade sausage was developed as part of Pavilions' 
'fresh concept,' " says Julie Reynolds, public relations director for Vons. 
"Our research showed sausages would be in high demand."  
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen varieties are available with or without casings. 
</P>
<P>
 Vons Pavilions stores: 1110 W. Alameda Blvd., Burbank, 6 a.m. to midnight 
daily, (818) 567-0257. 1135 Lindero Canyon Road, Thousand Oaks, 7 a.m. to 11

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: CLOTHING DISCOUNTS JUST FOR MEMBERS; A ONE-TIME FEE AT 
DAMONE'S OFFERS SHOPPERS AN IMPRESSIVE COLLECTION OF DESIGNER STYLES AS WELL AS 
PERSONAL SERVICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If women shoppers knew that they could purchase the latest styles from about 
20 top designers at 30% to 60% below retail, would they be willing to pay a 
one-time membership fee of $25 for that shopping privilege? 
</P>
<P>
 This is what Irwin Schwartz, owner of Damone's, asked himself two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz knew that a membership fee would eliminate most of the looky-loos and 
allow him to trim sales personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 He also believed that most of his steady customers would join, and they did -- 
almost 5,000 of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz focuses on a select clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 "These ladies are serious shoppers," he says. "They know precisely what they 
want, and they don't quibble." 
</P>
<P>
 The women seek current styles by name designers: Kasper, Adolfo, Nolan Miller, 
Albert Nipon, Cattiva, Pat Richards, After Five, Bob Mackie, George Simonton, 
Judith Ann, P.S.I and Bicci. 
</P>
<P>
 After presenting one's membership card, with photo ID, at the locked door, one 
enters the warehouse, where thousands of gowns, suits and casual apparel are on 
racks, each protected by a plastic cover. 
</P>
<P>
 On the right as you enter are the afternoon dresses; along the wall to the 
left are the dressy suits. Down the middle are the career suits and, in the 
rear, one finds the casual styles. 
</P>
<P>
 And for weary customers, there's an adjoining salon with sofas and 
refreshments for a pick-me-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Because sizes run from 4 to 24, there's something for just about everybody, 
and the selection is far more extensive than in almost any boutique or 
department store in town. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long, middle row of suits, a double-breasted Albert Nipon that retails 
for $300 was $139. A handsome suit with the George Simonton label that retails 
for around $525 sells for $399. 
</P>
<P>
 The prices are coded, but it's no problem since Schwartz's wife, Lorna, is 
there to give individual and private consultation to each shopper. 
</P>
<P>
 Damone's originally concentrated on special-occasion attire, and that focus is 
still in force. For those who covet a Bob Mackie for a big event, a 
full-length, long-sleeved black-and-gold beaded gown that would run about 
$1,600 sells at Damone's for $779. 
</P>
<P>
 For a dressy afternoon, a muted chiffon print ensemble (dress with matching 
coat) by Cattiva would cost $440 in major boutiques around town, but Damone's 
price is $259. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's possible, of course, that exactly what the customer wants will not be on 
the racks, but Schwartz can place special orders at the same discounted prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis on personal service matches the expensive boutiques and is 
impossible to find at discounters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Schwartzes will even take a selection of garments, gleaned from their 
inventory, to a client's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Damone's fills a niche for discerning shoppers who know what designers they 
like and what styles they want. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers call ahead from as far away as Santa Barbara, Palm Springs and Las 
Vegas for appointments to purchase a season's wardrobe in one afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 As a promotional tool, Damone's stages fashion shows for organizations at no 
charge. Those attending may purchase their lifetime shopping membership at 
these events. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Schwartz is liquidating his bridal gown inventory and is pricing 
gowns by Demetrios, Alfred D'Angelo, Marissa and the like at 50% below his 
cost; i.e., a $600 gown is $150.

VALLEY VOGUE / CINDY LAFAVRE YORKS; IN THE SWIM; VELVET AND FISHNET OFFER AN 
INTERESTING VARIATION ON SUMMER'S SKINTIGHT SUITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CINDY LaFAVRE YORKS, Cindy LaFavre Yorks writes regularly about fashion for 
The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thick is in for swimwear -- not the bodies wearing them, but the fabric used 
to make them. The flat Lycra so prevalent in previous seasons is beefed up, 
thanks to tactile textures, print combinations and net overlays for added 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the interest in raising the look of a fabric designed to be skintight? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something different, but the suits are also quite deceiving because they 
hide little flaws with their extra texture," says Jean Renna, manager of 
Everything But Water in Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park, where high-fashion 
swimsuits sell for an average of $65 each. Renna's swimsuit store features a 
variety of the textured suits, including a leathery fishnet style echoing the 
wilds of the jungle. Smooth velvet suits in particular, she says, are getting 
snapped up by younger girls who wore so much of the crushed velvet separates 
earlier this winter and, in some cases, even to prom. 
</P>
<P>
 The hottest colors for suits this summer are earthy brown, rust, cream and 
olive shades, Renna says. Though many solids prevail, there is a steady influx 
of tropical and ethnic prints rounding out the options. Another big change in 
the swimwear silhouette are the curvy bra cups accentuated with wires for a 
sculptured look.  
</P>
<P>
 More mature customers are going for control, via suits such as the Carol Wior 
Slimsuit, designed to take an inch off your abdomen. The store also stocks 
specialty suits for pregnant women, women who have undergone mastectomies and 
busty women who need bra tops in C, D, DD or, rarer still, E cup sizes. For 
those needing extra dimension as opposed to support, Renna has suits with bust 
enhancers designed to increase support and uplift, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Renna also has a next-to-nothing suit that she says is generating a lot of 
excitement: the modified Brazilian cut -- a variation on the thong -- that 
completely covers the rear end. It also has expanded coverage in the front 
because, says Renna, "too many times the front was too narrow, too -- but the 
suit still has the nice, high arch in the front that women seem to like." 
</P>
<P>
 Women looking to spend less will appreciate the gentle prices of Target 
swimwear, priced from $15.99 to $39.99. Equally trendy styles featuring animal 
prints, plaids, checks and bandanna prints reinforce the texture craze. 
Detailing -- via braided straps and scalloped edging -- also is prominent. 
Target features a Figure Help Line designed to help minimize or enhance various 
body parts, while especially hard-to-fit women might check out Target's Sun 
Separates. The individual tops and bottoms, sold separately for $12.99 each, 
make it possible for women with varying proportions to customize a suit. 
</P>
<P>
 SUGAR, SUGAR: Granted, sugar for some is a moment on the lips, forever on the 
hips -- but a moment on the legs, well that's another thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sugaring" is the latest in hair-removal techniques. Still offered only by a 
limited number of salons -- Senna Cosmetics in Tarzana is among the handful 
that do in the Los Angeles area -- it is the latest alternative to removing 
hair without the pain of waxing.  
</P>
<P>
 Two sugaring techniques are available -- one relies on gauze strips and is 
similar to a waxing procedure -- but the most established and most popular 
involves a large, sticky ball. The procedure begins with a cleansing and 
powdering of the skin. The technician then mixes a paste consisting of sugar, 
lemon and herbs. She forms it into a sticky ball and guides it with her hand 
across the hairy surface with a repetitive scooping motion, in a sense plucking 
the hair from its root via a firm massaging motion. The hair is "flicked" off 
using this procedure. An application of moisturizing lotion finishes the 
procedure. It takes more than just special training for sugaring to be 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever does it needs to have pretty strong arm muscles, it takes a pretty 
powerful hand," says Eugenia Weston, Senna Cosmetics owner. 
</P>
<P>
 How does it compare to waxing? Weston says the process is less painful and 
even incorporates a massage benefit thanks to the firm motion involved in 
removing the hair. It costs a little more but lasts just as long (six to eight 
weeks minimum is typical, though some clients can go longer.) Prices at Senna 
Cosmetics range from $7.50 for a lip sugaring to $55 for both legs (thigh to 
toe). For information on sugaring, call the salon, (818) 881-4911. 
</P>
<P>
 PAREO POWER: Looking for an alternative to those corny matching swimsuit 
cover-ups that line the walls of swimwear stores? More original looks are 
possible, even downright trendy. J. Crew offers pareos for just that purpose. A 
pareo is a long wrap designed to be tied at the side or center and is worn like 
a sarong.  
</P>
<P>
 If they are large enough (and the wearer is tiny enough!), pareos can even be 
worn as tube dresses. They're ideal for travel since they pack flat and 
function as a garment and an accessory (they make ideal shawls for cool 
tropical evenings) and extend wardrobe possibilities when packing light. 
</P>
<P>
 At J. Crew in the Promenade at Woodland Hills, the wispy cotton pareo, 
available with stripes, batik prints and summery solid shades, sells for $28 to 
$38. Savvy seamstresses can make their own out of any 63-inch by 43-inch piece 
of fabric. The only sewing is a simple edging of the four sides.  
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, the pareo has been limited to females, but free-thinking 
men have been seen on the beaches of Tahiti wearing them atop their Speedo 
swimsuits. Whether this trend will cross the Pacific and end up at Zuma Beach, 
however, remains to be seen.

PELICAN'S RETREAT SIZZLES TO REGGAE BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Where can you get a ticket to paradise on Tuesday night and return in time for 
work the next day -- without jet lag? Nestled against the hills of Calabasas is 
a different sort of retreat -- Pelican's Retreat -- where every Tuesday night 
is filled with rhythmic reggae, friendly natives and an atmosphere that can 
only be described as sizzling.  
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: This restaurant / nightclub becomes an urban oasis when the band, 
Urban Dread, shows up about 9:30 every Tuesday night. Revelers begin spilling 
onto the sawdust-strewn dance floor or stake their claim at a cozy table under 
the wooden rafters. Harpoons, life preservers and wooden pelicans add to the 
castaway feel. And there are two patios, a pair of pool tables and three bars 
that are perfect for kicking back or getting to know someone more intimately. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: Tuesday's reggae night draws a more diverse cast of characters than 
"Gilligan's Island." Some are magnetic, like Leon Siff, the 66-year-old 
"vibrating man" from West Hills who hops around the dance floor. Nearly all are 
creatures of energy -- in their early 20s -- who submerge themselves in the 
flow of music. Sexy, tropical fashion -- from bellybutton rings to grass 
skirts, often decorate the dance floor. It's almost impossible not to be 
friendly here. By midnight, it's standing room only. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MUSIC: Urban Dread sends out soothing waves of reggae that spark the most 
primal instinct to dance. From bongo banger to base player, the five-member 
band sends out a simple message: "No worry, no worry, no worry." 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: There's no head-banging, get-out-of-my-space attitude here. "The 
music brings the people together," said Siff. "You have a younger crowd here, 
which is very attractive." The mixed drinks are also appealing: try a Pelican's 
Punch, Cranberry Kamikazi or one of bartender Ken Johnson's "Ken-coctions."  
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: "The only bad thing is that it gets too crowded," said Gail Smith, 
21, of Thousand Oaks. "Sometimes you can't even walk through here." 
</P>
<P>
 Pelican's Retreat, 24454 Calabasas Road, Calabasas, hosts Urban Dread for 
reggae night from 9:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. Tuesdays. Cover charge is $5. (818)

TREASURES OF THE EAST; THE PACIFIC ASIA MUSEUM IS AN ARCHITECTURAL DELIGHT AS 
WELL AS HOME TO EXTRAORDINARY ART AND ARTIFACTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY KAPITANOFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Nancy Kapitanoff writes regularly 
about art for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This city certainly has a right to be proud of its architectural history. It 
is home to the largest concentration of Charles and Henry Greene's finely 
designed and built Craftsman houses. Among the most notable jewels in this 
"Crown of the Valley" -- what Pasadena means in the language of the Chippewa 
Indians -- is the Greenes' Gamble House. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there are some other, unusual gems within the city limits. On North 
Los Robles Avenue stands what is today the Pacific Asia Museum. The building, 
which was designed in the style of a Chinese Imperial Palace courtyard, was 
constructed in 1925 by architects Marston, Van Pelt & Maybury for Grace 
Nicholson. An Asian art importer, she lived there and used the property as her 
sales showroom until her death in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grace Nicholson building, a state Historic Landmark, is listed on the 
National Register of Historic Places. It was home to the Pasadena Art Museum 
until that museum moved to what is now the Norton Simon Museum. The Pacific 
Asia Museum opened at the site in 1971. It is the only museum in Southern 
California specializing in preserving and interpreting the arts and culture of 
the Pacific and Asia, and promoting a better understanding of the peoples and 
heritages there. 
</P>
<P>
 Please note that the first exhibit on this tour and the show of contemporary 
paintings from Pakistan will close July 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you step inside, take a moment to appreciate the architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 1 to 1:30 p.m.: After paying for admission, begin with an exhibit drawn from 
about 100 objects in the Lydman Collection. You'll find Chinese ceramics of the 
Song, Yuan and Ming dynasties, and Southeast Asian bronze and stone sculptures. 
The majority of items in the collection are everyday wares made for domestic 
use and export. Many of the platters, bowls, vases and jugs date to the 15th 
and 16th centuries, and some to the 11th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 1:30 to 2 p.m.: Go through the back door of the Lydman gallery to the museum's 
galleries for students (we're all students, right? -- regardless of age). 
Encounter "Life in Tibet," a show of objects and photographs designed to foster 
understanding of the Tibetan people's beliefs and way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second student gallery, you'll find 19th-Century photographs that give 
viewers an idea of traditional Japanese clothing; a display of Japan's three 
classical instruments, and scores for each one, among other objects; and an 
array of finely made objects used in Chinese and Japanese calligraphy, 
including scrolls, brushes, ink sticks, paper and seals. 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 2:30 p.m.: Enter the special exhibit organized by museum Director David 
Kamansky and Marcella Nesom Sirhandi, an authority on contemporary Pakistani 
paintings. It is the first major exhibit of such art ever shown in the United 
States. A wide range of content and styles is presented in 45 paintings by 
artists from Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad and Peshawar -- one-third of them 
women. Ends July 17. 
</P>
<P>
 2:30 to 3 p.m.: Enter the next room, which contains Southeast Asian ceramics: 
bowls, vases, jars and even an appealing dog from Thailand, circa 1500. Various 
Buddha torsos and heads date from the 1400s to the 1600s. 
</P>
<P>
 The next gallery will introduce you to the Asmat people of Indonesia, through 
intriguing wood sculptures and photographs of them. It leads to an elegant 
gallery displaying Bodhisattvas -- from Buddhism, those who have attained 
enlightenment and help others do so -- as well as nephrite (a form of jade) and 
ivory pieces, and various deity figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Move on to discover dozens of delicately crafted netsuke. Beginning in the 
early 1600s until the early 1900s, Japanese men wore netsuke -- small replicas 
of masks worn in dances and dramas -- hanging from their kimono sashes. As 
kimonos did not have pockets, the netsuke served as counterweights to secure a 
suspended object such as a purse, tobacco pouch, medicine box or writing kit. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final gallery of this wing, observe the gentle beauty of Chinese and 
Japanese scrolls, many from the 1700s, made of ink and colors on paper or silk. 
</P>
<P>
 3 to 3:30 p.m.: Peruse the museum bookstore for books, posters and catalogues 
on Pacific and Asian art and culture. Gift items include ceramics, jewelry, 
textiles, cards and children's books, toys and games. 
</P>
<P>
 Then go out into the Chinese courtyard garden, with its attractive plants and 
a pond filled with large fish. Here is another opportunity to study the 
building's architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 At the back of the garden and upstairs is the Foyer Gallery, which presents 
special exhibits. Since Saturday, "Games of the Asian World" has displayed art 
from the museum's collection that depicts people engaged in various sports or 
games. This show coincides with the World Cup soccer games.  
</P>
<P>
 Before you leave the museum grounds, you may want to return to where you paid 
your admission. There is the entrance to the Osborne Gallery, which sells 
antiques and contemporary fine art. 
</P>
<P>
 3:30 to 4 p.m.: For a look at another one of Pasadena's architectural 
delights: Turn right as you leave the museum, walking just a few steps to the 
corner, Union Street. Go left, or west, one long block to Euclid Avenue. There 
you will find City Hall. 
</P>

BUTTERFLIES' POPULARITY TAKING OFF; THIS YEAR'S COUNT WILL TALLY SPECIES FOUND 
AT MORE THAN 200 SITES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For decades, birders have grabbed their binoculars at Christmastime and joined 
in the National Au dubon Society's annual Christmas bird count. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the 20th anniversary of another census of beautiful flyers -- the 
annual Fourth of July butterfly count. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored this year by the recently formed North American Butterfly Assn., 
based in Morristown, N.J., the census will tally both the species and 
individuals found at each of more than 200 sites across the country. Modeled on 
the venerable bird count, participants will take note of every butterfly within 
a designated area 15 miles in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
 The counts, which numbered 211 last year in 40 states, four Canadian provinces 
and a site in Mexico, will be held during 24-hour periods between June 11 and 
July 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Local residents who want to test their skill at spotting swallowtails and 
painted ladies can participate in any of several upcoming tallies. A group will 
meet Saturday in the Mount Baden-Powell area in the San Gabriel Mountains (the 
mountain is the tallest in Los Angeles County). The closest count for most San 
Fernando Valley residents will be July 9 in the Santa Ynez Canyon area of the 
Santa Monica Mountains. And there also will be a census July 23 on the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula, home of the recently rediscovered Palos Verdes blue 
butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Paul Opler, Colorado-based coordinator of this year's Fourth of 
July tally, interest in butterflies is booming. Last year more than 1,650 
people turned out for the national survey, and the number of individual counts 
is increasing 10% to 20% a year. Moreover, the program is attracting a whole 
new breed of butterfly enthusiast. Unlike the lepidopterists of yore, who went 
into the field with a net and a jar of formaldehyde, today's butterfly fanciers 
like to study their subjects through close-focus binoculars and capture the 
creatures, if at all, on film before they flutter away. 
</P>
<P>
 The change is much like the one that transformed the study of birds almost 60 
years ago, from a pure science based largely on the study of dead animals to a 
popular pastime involving the observation of live animals in the wild. Opler 
reports: "Roger Tory Petersen, who's the guru of bird-watching, told me 
butterfly watching is at the stage bird-watching was when his first field guide 
was published in the 1930s." 
</P>
<P>
 Birders are among the most gung ho of the new butterfly people. Kimball 
Garrett is collections manager in the ornithology department at the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Natural History. A distinguished bird guy, Garrett is in the 
habit of observing butterflies about 10 in the morning, when the birds that are 
his first love tend to seek shade and a low profile. Garrett, a tactful bird 
enthusiast, doesn't want lepidopterists to think he is observing butterflies 
simply because birds are nowhere to be found in the hottest part of the day. "I 
wouldn't say it's a conversion, so much as an expansion," he says of his 
born-again interest in butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
 There are reasons why bird people are becoming butterfly people. As Julian 
Donahue, the emeritus curator of lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) at the 
Museum of Natural History explains, summer is the slack time for local 
bird-watchers. The major migrants have moved on, and the birders are left 
behind with their skills and their often-pricey equipment. Most birders have 
honed their ability to identify creatures in the wild by field marks -- 
coloration, behavior, calls and other clues that living animals provide. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime birder Fred Heath, who will lead the Mount Baden-Powell group 
Saturday, says butterflies are a natural extension of his interest in birds. 
"It's something to do when the birds become quiet and it's a related skill," he 
says. One of the things that drew him to butterflies is that they tend to stay 
in the area where they are born. "You become aware of the relationship with the 
habitat," he says. Good butterfly observers learn such things as the plants 
that particular butterfly larvae need to survive. The larvae of the endangered 
Palos Verdes blue butterfly, for instance, feed on rattle weed -- if the plant 
disappears, so do the butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jess Morton, coordinator of the Palos Verdes Peninsula count, 
education is the primary goal. As Morton points out, there are typically more 
human participants in the peninsula census than there are butterfly species. 
That's great, as far as Morton is concerned. The count, which has taken place 
on the peninsula since 1981, has dramatically increased scientific knowledge 
about the behavior and other relevant information about local butterflies, he 
says. "As a friend of mine says, we know more about what's on the surface of 
the moon than what's in an empty lot next door." 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Takai, a professor of biology at Santa Monica College who will lead the 
Santa Ynez Canyon foray, doesn't want to overstate the interest in butterflies. 
"It's never been like the Christmas bird count," he says. Last year, six mavens 
grabbed their binoculars. "This year, we might reach double digits." Maybe.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; THE DELI DILEMMA; FACTOR'S FAMOUS TRIES TO FILL THE VOID 
LEFT AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE, BUT WHEN THE PASTRAMI IS STACKED, IT JUST ISN'T 
ART'S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "I'm depressed," confides one of my pickier dining companions. "Since the 
earthquake closed down Art's, I don't know where to go for a great corned beef 
sandwich." 
</P>
<P>
 Relief does not appear imminent. The San Fernando Valley fairly abounds with 
delis, such as Jerry's Famous in Studio City, the very good Brent's up in 
Northridge and the spiffy new Factor's Famous over in Encino, but none of them 
seems quite poised to take up Art's mantle as the Valley's best deli. And who 
wants to schlep Downtown to Seventh and Alvarado just to feast on the corned 
beef and pastrami at Langer's? (I will, if you give my arm a little twist.) 
</P>
<P>
 Factor's Encino certainly does look the part of the typical California deli. 
It's a huge, confident, upscale sort of room with high ceilings and an 
attractive takeout counter by the front door. Never mind that it's a branch of 
a humbler place on Pico in Beverlywood. This is the Valley Factor's, and that's 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 The beige walls are lined with posters advertising newish movies: "Cocoon," 
"Fried Green Tomatoes," even the just-released "Blown Away." Most customers eat 
clustered together at wooden tables crammed into the wide-open center of the 
room. Come during the lunch rush, and that's where you will probably sit, too. 
We, however, arrive by 11:30 and are able to grab one of the low-slung, 
vinyl-upholstered side booths that generally fill up by noon. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that we are hunkered down in our choice spot, a waiter comes over and 
plies us with a basket of crisp bagel chips and snappy-fresh, half-sour 
pickles. We nibble on them at our ease, blissfully unaware that they are going 
to be the best appetizers we will taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Our first order to arrive is stuffed kishka, a deli acid test. This 
interpretation of the traditional Jewish meatless sausage is stuffed as usual 
with flour, chicken fat, carrots and spices, but it comes up gluey and insipid. 
And it's grilled , a deli blasphemy. (Listen, this is not California Cuisine 
here. Kishka is supposed to be steamed.) A thick, caramel-brown gravy fails to 
add any charm. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're not in the mood for the properly salty chopped herring or the rather 
solidly packed chopped liver, the soups are a reasonably good way to start a 
meal. Soup-er-pot, a reduced version of the even more substantial entree called 
chicken in the pot, is a good-sized metal tureen containing chicken soup, a 
couple of fluffy matzo balls, one rather large and leaden chicken kreplach, 
some noodles and, supposedly, rice and kasha. My tureen is loaded with noodles 
and matzo balls, plus a good deal of white meat chicken, but as far as I can 
tell, no rice, no kasha. (Kvetch, kvetch.) 
</P>
<P>
 The waiter now suggests we try what he terms the deli's "excellent sandwich 
meats," managing to sound just like Keanu Reeves in "Bill and Ted's Excellent 
Adventure," dude. No one is put off, of course. We are already sure that this 
isn't the Second Avenue Deli, so the Valley accent feels oddly appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 The meats, however, are just OK -- not particularly tender. The best sandwich 
deal has to be one of the massive combination sandwiches, triple-deckers served 
with decently runny cole slaw and a creamy potato salad that is perhaps a bit 
heavy with the celery salt. My favorite is No. 9: corned beef, pastrami, 
tongue, Swiss cheese, Russian dressing and lettuce and tomato.  
</P>
<P>
 The pastrami at Factor's lacks peppery bite, and the brisket has little 
flavor, but the corned beef is grainy and fine, and the tongue is tender and 
flavorful. I'd complain less if the deli had a better selection of mustards, 
but you are forced to choose between Beaver's Sweet and Sour and a whole-grain 
type that is sticky and overly pungent. 
</P>
<P>
 Factor's is temporarily closed for remodeling during dinner, but you can rely 
on the roast chicken, which is crisp-skinned and on the well-done side. There's 
also a marinated Romanian skirt steak with lots of flavor and a dense, chunky 
turkey loaf that reminds me of a misbegotten country pate. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts come through with flying colors, anyway. You can choose creamy New 
York-style cheesecake, home-baked apple pie, even a richly glazed chocolate 
cake with the name Sacher drooled across the top in frosting. This cake bears 
little resemblance to a real Viennese Sacher torte, but hey, dude, this is 
Encino, not Vienna, and certainly not Second Avenue. And the cake really is, 
like, excellent. WHERE AND WHEN

EVEN A STRONG CASE BY D.A. CAN BE TESTED BY DEFENSE; STRATEGY: SIMPSON LAWYERS 
WILL TRY TO KEEP OUT EVIDENCE FROM SEARCH, 911 TAPES. IT WILL NOT BE EASY, 
EXPERTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It can appear to be a powerful case: blood tests seem to link the suspect to 
the scene, a search conducted under a warrant uncovers incriminating items and 
police have evidence showing that the suspect had brutalized the victim before. 
</P>
<P>
 But skillful defense work -- and the right set of circumstances -- can unravel 
the most carefully crafted prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for O.J. Simpson are expected to file a variety of motions to try to 
keep out evidence that allegedly ties the famed former athlete to the murders 
of his ex-wife and her friend. On Tuesday they are scheduled to argue a motion 
to suppress evidence from a search of Simpson's home June 13. They also may 
eventually try to exclude other evidence, including his statements to police, 
old 911 tapes of Nicole Brown Simpson calling for help as a man identified as 
O.J. Simpson raged in the background, and the results of DNA tests that might 
indicate that blood and hair found at the murder scene match Simpson's. 
</P>
<P>
 None of it will be easy. But if Simpson's lawyers successfully show the 
initial search of his home was illegal, the prosecution could lose key 
evidence: the bloody glove that apparently matches one found at the murder 
scene and possibly even blood found on Simpson's driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be an amazing event that the most crucial piece of evidence in a 
high-profile murder case was thrown out," said Cristina Arguedas, a Bay Area 
criminal defense attorney. "That would take one gutsy judge." 
</P>
<P>
 But such motions have succeeded before in long-shot cases. In a Bay Area case, 
a man facing 40 years in prison after drugs and a machine gun were found in his 
home was set free because police had made a false implication in applying for 
the search warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Christian Brando murder case in 1991, the same lawyers who are 
defending Simpson successfully kept out Brando's statements to police because 
an officer had omitted a phrase in the reading of the Miranda rights. 
</P>
<P>
 And a Court of Appeal in San Francisco ruled DNA evidence inadmissible two 
years ago because of scientific uncertainty over how to calculate the odds of a 
match. Admissibility of the Search 
</P>
<P>
 In the pending motion to suppress evidence, Simpson's lawyers argue that the 
police, scaling a five-foot-high fence, illegally entered the grounds of the 
ex-athlete's Brentwood home when they first went there at 4:30 a.m. on June 13 
to notify him of his ex-wife's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Once on the grounds, police found the bloodstained glove. Later, they noticed 
blood leading from Simpson's white Ford Bronco on the street to his front door, 
according to an affidavit by Los Angeles Police Detective Philip L. Vannatter. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are required to obtain a warrant to search someone's property except 
under certain conditions, such as when they are pursuing a fleeing suspect or 
attempting to preserve evidence they fear is about to be destroyed.  
</P>
<P>
 Even a search done with a warrant can be unlawful if police misrepresented an 
important fact in seeking it. Simpson's lawyers contend that police 
inaccurately characterized Simpson's absence in their warrant application by 
stating that he had left on an "unexpected" flight to Chicago, even though they 
knew he was on a planned business trip.  
</P>
<P>
 But defense lawyers said a warrant can only be thrown out for deliberate 
misrepresentation if the magistrate would not have issued it without the false 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Some defense attorneys said Thursday they believe the warrant might be upheld 
when it is heard next week because police said they saw "what appeared to be 
human blood" on the driver's door handle of Simpson's Bronco, which was parked 
on the street. That evidence alone, they said, might have been enough to obtain 
the search warrant.  
</P>
<P>
 Others said it would not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mere presence of bloodstains on the white Bronco parked on a public 
street might not be enough to say there was exigent circumstances to go inside 
the estate, unless that blood was very fresh," said UCLA criminal law professor 
Peter Arenella.  
</P>
<P>
 Several lawyers said it was difficult to make a definitive assessment because 
critical facts have not been revealed yet. Los Angeles criminal defense lawyer 
Barry Levin noted that "Vannatter's affidavit is devoid of key details. It says 
nothing about jumping the fence or the purpose for which the entry was made."  
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Brown said: "If you are going to climb over 
someone's fence, you better get a warrant. You are stupid if you don't. You are 
just screwing up somebody's case." The Police Interview 
</P>
<P>
 As the case proceeds, Simpson's lawyers also may try to prevent the 
prosecution from using his statements to the police prior to his arrest. 
Against the advice of his then-attorney, Howard Weitzman, Simpson talked to 
police by himself for three hours on the day after the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Simpson waived his Miranda rights after talking to his attorney, trying 
to keep out his statements is "going to be very hard in this case," said Bay 
Area defense attorney Ted Cassman. Prosecutor Marcia Clark has said that 
Simpson gave all the proper waivers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not yet known what Simpson told the police, but defense attorneys say 
prosecutors could try to use any inconsistencies in his statements against him. 
The 911 Tapes 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said the Simpson defense probably would have better luck in 
excluding the 911 tapes from the trial, an issue that could arise after the 
preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge would first have to decide whether the tapes were relevant to the 
murder charges against Simpson, and secondly, whether their relevance was 
outweighed by the prejudice they would create against the defendant. Prior 
Evidence of Violence 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the tapes, Simpson's alleged assaults against his former wife 
could be admitted into evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The courts have a great deal of discretion," Brown said.  
</P>
<P>
 Court rulings on admitting evidence of prior abuse in such cases have been 
divided. In a 1983 murder case, a state appellate court held that evidence that 
a husband dragged his wife outside their home, sprayed her with a hose and 
yelled obscenities at her was irrelevant and inadmissible. The court said there 
was no close connection between the husband's previous action and the wife's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 But in another case three years later, a different state appellate court held 
that a prior assault was admissible because it showed motive to kill and ill 
will. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior violence is generally admissible if it demonstrates that the defendant 
acted according to a common scheme or plan. For example, evidence that linked a 
defendant to a signature murder where a playing card was left on the victim 
could be used to buttress evidence against him in a nearly identical murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there is no common scheme or plan between an allegation of hitting during 
an argument and breaking down the door," said an experienced San Diego criminal 
defense lawyer, referring to two incidents that sparked Nicole Simpson's 
previous calls to the police. "That is not even close to what we are talking 
about in this case." The Controversy Over DNA Testing 
</P>
<P>
 DNA evidence could also be problematic. Most courts in the country admit such 
genetic evidence but California's appellate courts have been divided on the 
question and the California Supreme Court has not yet ruled on it. 
</P>
<P>
 A Court of Appeal in San Francisco held two years ago that a critical part of 
DNA evidence -- the statistics showing the chance that someone other than the 
defendant would have the same genetic profile -- was inadmissible. The court 
excluded the evidence on the grounds that scientists were in fundamental 
disagreement about the validity of statistical methods used by the FBI and a 
private testing lab in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, the prosecution had relied on a type of DNA testing that can 
take two to three months and produce powerful results that juries find hard to 
overlook. For instance, the test can determine that the chances of another 
person having that DNA is only one in several million. 
</P>
<P>
 In a pending case, a state appellate court is being asked to rule on the 
validity of a DNA testing method known as polymerase chain reaction, or PCR. It 
can be done more quickly than the older method but does not purport to show 
such high odds against a similar match. 
</P>
<P>
 No court in California has ruled on this method. Prosecutors say it is sound 
but some defense attorneys are wary.  
</P>
<P>
 Walter Krstulja, a senior trial attorney and forensics expert in the Los 
Angeles public defender's office, warns that PCR evidence can be unreliable 
because samples can easily be contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The test appears very promising," he said, "but issues of quality control and 
contamination still have to be worked out." 
</P>
<P>
 Alameda County prosecutor Rockne Harmon, who has often used DNA results in his 
cases, strongly believes that the testing methods and statistical analyses are 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trial judges don't have much difficulty ruling this evidence admissible," 
Harmon said. "It is just the appellate judges who seem to be balking." 
</P>
<P>
 It is believed that prosecutors in the Simpson case are relying on both 
methods as well as on conventional serology, a less rigorous blood testing 
procedure. Only serology tests will be introduced at the preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the admissibility of any DNA test results may boil down to the 
credibility of the laboratory used by the prosecution and the statistical 
methods used to compute the odds of a match. 
</P>
<P>
 Some attorneys predict that the prosecution will win any fight over DNA 
results because previous court rulings were based on methods that are no longer 
used. Who's Who

 Hundreds of reporters, scores of hours of video, thousands of words expended 
to convey the tedium and the lunacy of Thursday in Los Angeles -- and this was 
only the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a day so crazy that O.J. Simpson's lawyer-friends Robert Kardashian and 
Leroy Taft, pursued into the street by reporters, took a bus to a Downtown 
restaurant for lunch and hitched a ride back to court in a police car. And it 
was a day so routine that in dense traffic a mere block from the courthouse, 
bored Angelenos who had been expecting legal fireworks had already switched 
their car radios to Motown, banda , country -- anything but O.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet no one could get away from it. 
</P>
<P>
 In a gym in Long Beach, people stayed aboard the Stairmasters so they could 
watch TV . . . in a Crenshaw district store a saleswoman's 5-year-old daughter 
said as the TV came on, "Oh no, not O.J. again!" . . . in a Chicago bar at 
noontime no one wondered who he was when the waitress asked, "Do you think he 
did it?" . . . in Atlanta, where, of the 66 color TVs in the electronics 
department of the Peachtree Street Macy's, all but two were turned to CNN and 
Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 The first day of O.J. Simpson's preliminary hearing could fit anyplace in 
L.A.'s kaleidoscope: 
</P>
<P>
 Variety would call it a plodding legal sequel that couldn't hold the audience, 
compared to the original blockbuster, the slow-mo twilight freeway chase of two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And the radio shrinks could say that Americans have had it up to here with 
O.J. . . . or that we're so avid for every scrap about the case that the Boston 
Globe can trill on for a dozen rapt paragraphs about the prosecutor's "head of 
tight curls" and the defense attorney's "deep, deep tan." 
</P>
<P>
 The day, frame by frame: 
</P>
<P>
 At 7:30 a.m., , Nicole Brown Simpson's sisters, parents and friends were 
sitting in the back booth of a Downtown coffee shop, waiting to attend the 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing that had gotten as much buildup as the opening of a new Steven 
Spielberg movie began with promising drama, when the helicopters hover into 
sound and view at 8:40 a.m., tracking the police van bringing Simpson to court. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The courtroom pace moved ponderously, disappointing many who had expected 
incendiary TV-movie lawyering. But not everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 At Jefferson Boulevard and Crenshaw Avenue, where "Pray for O.J." T-shirts 
rippled like flags in the late June wind, Jay Akeem paid $10 for an extra-large 
and said: "We grew up on 'Perry Mason' and 'Matlock'. . . . It's tedious going 
through the proceedings, though. I was watching this morning, the forensics, 
the LAPD woman -- (it was) getting real technical, but it's important." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Legends sports bar in Santa Monica, Steve Grospitz was late for lunch 
with his sister Lori because he had been watching the case. "I actually was 
kind of wanting for this to get started; we heard so much hearsay. I was 
interested in what the court was going to do. Michael Jackson, the Menendez 
thing." But the city's energy, he figures, "is kind of exhausted." 
</P>
<P>
 And at an Encino electronics shop, Frank Peters stood transfixed before 
Simpson's hearing in Warholian replica on 25 screens: "It can get boring and 
bogged down at times, but overall, it gives an understanding of judicial 
process." 
</P>
<P>
 With only 80 seats in the courtroom, news stations and the curious found 
livelier events out on the courthouse sidewalks. Seesaw debates went on between 
Simpson supporters and people such as Jewish Defense League leader Irv Rubin, 
who demanded via bullhorn that defense attorney Robert L. Shapiro not forget 
his "Jewish brother, Ronald Goldman," one of the victims.  
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, artist Rodney Vanworth created an instant mural when he spread a 
six-foot canvas on the sidewalk and invited people to write on it with markers. 
He had already drawn the figure of a red-smeared woman with knives sticking out 
of her body, a shoe, a jail cell, a sink and a toilet and a trophy with the 
words "hero" and "pity the victims" written on it. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brentwood, as police searched an empty lot for more evidence, it was like 
old times -- 2 1/2 weeks ago when Brentwood was the center of the action. 
</P>
<P>
 Noted Brentwood resident Richard Riordan, out for a stroll near his home, was 
hailed by a limo driver. "Mayor!" the man hollered, and then, with a flourish, 
told his passengers -- Australian tourists visiting the murder site -- "This is 
the mayor of Los Angeles!" 
</P>
<P>
 A delivery man from A Votre Sante restaurant, who had fed the media mob in 
Brentwood last month, lost no time in returning Thursday, joining other 
caterers who followed the helicopters to the police search. Sean McFarland 
handed out menus for fare like whole wheat chapatis filled with hummus. "This 
is Brentwood," he said. "Nobody eats anything with fat in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce has been part of big legal cases since fast-buck artists sold toy 
monkeys on the sidewalks outside the Scopes evolution trial in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courthouse, shirt-seller K.T. had virtually cleared out all 20 
dozen shirts -- "Don't Squeeze the Juice" and "Pray for O.J." -- in two days. 
One woman asked K.T., "Do you have any with the opposite point of view, like 
'Fry O.J.'?" 
</P>
<P>
 Just as white Ford Broncos suddenly had higher appeal after the Simpson 
freeway chase -- a Georgia dealer reportedly parked one in front of his lot 
with the sign, "As Seen on TV" -- a Downtown cutlery store was inundated with 
requests for a particular style of large knife after witnesses at the hearing 
testified that Simpson had bought one there. 
</P>
<P>
 City Hall sidewalks served as little more than a parking lot for TV vans -- 
and they all got parking tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 In one city councilman's office, the receptionist admitted that "there's a TV 
in back that no one's supposed to know about." And standing with the smokers on 
the west steps, Vivian Sarpong complained that she had gone to a drugstore 
Thursday morning to buy "one of those little TVs, and they were all sold out!" 
At her desk, she prepared "a little spot for my TV. Got a little piece of 
cardboard in case anybody comes by, I can flop it down, cover it up." 
</P>
<P>
 If people watched or listened at work, most tried to do so unobtrusively. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Radio Shack in the bowels of the Arco towers, a TV showed the Simpson 
case -- but partly because the reception was too bad to get soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 And at Mezzaluna, the bright, prow-shaped Brentwood restaurant where Nicole 
Simpson last ate and Goldman last worked, waiters sliding the luncheon specials 
into the menus looked up at the television suspended from the cloud-painted 
ceiling, and murmured about the day's legal doings in overheard snippets like 
"special circumstances" and "and then he walks." 
</P>
<P>
 The start of the hearing coincided with lunch hour in other parts of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 In the back room of Mother Hubbard's in Chicago, claims adjuster Alona Sanders 
got to monitor the case at work the first day -- but today is another matter. 
"They came in and told us today that as of tomorrow, they were cutting off the 
radios during work hours," Sanders said. "They think it's interfering with our 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 It's soccer, not Simpson, that's disrupting the Russian parliament by keeping 
people up until 2 a.m.. And in bookish Boston, one woman's regular two-hour 
Saturday phone call to her mother in Ohio has been devoted exclusively to 
Simpson, and now runs three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Los Angeles, only one moment seemed to vary from the script.  
</P>
<P>
 A tall man in a suit walked into the heavily secured court wearing one of the 
rare white badges identifying him as a member of the defense or prosecution 
team. He said he was "a good friend of O.J.'s and Shapiro's." 
</P>
<P>
 When deputies asked Shapiro about that, the attorney said: "I've never seen 
him in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 As deputies tried to corner the man, he fled.

SIMPSON BOUGHT A KNIFE WEEKS BEFORE SLAYINGS, COURT IS TOLD; TESTIMONY: 
WITNESSES AT OPENING OF PRELIMINARY HEARING SAY THE DEFENDANT MADE THE PURCHASE 
IN MAY. IN BRENTWOOD, POLICE SCOUR LOT IN A RENEWED SEARCH FOR THE WEAPON.

<P>
 Seventeen days after O.J. Simpson's ex-wife and a friend were found brutally 
murdered, prosecutors Thursday debuted their case in court, presenting as their 
first witnesses two cutlery store workers who said they sold Simpson a 15-inch 
Stiletto knife six weeks before the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess something attracted him about the knife. It's a nice-looking knife. 
And he just, he liked it," said Jose Camacho, an employee of a Ross Cutlery 
store in Downtown Los Angeles, who acknowledged under oath that he had sold an 
interview to a supermarket tabloid. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Camacho nor other witnesses who took the stand Thursday placed Simpson 
at the crime scene. But their appearances may help lay the groundwork for the 
prosecution case, establishing that Simpson had access to a weapon such as the 
one that detectives believe was used to kill Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald 
Lyle Goldman, whose bloody bodies were found outside Nicole Simpson's Brentwood 
townhouse early June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, legal experts noted that there is a tremendous difference between 
showing that Simpson owned a knife similar to the possible murder weapon and 
producing the weapon. Harland W. Braun, a noted Los Angeles criminal defense 
lawyer, said prosecutors will need to present more evidence tying Simpson to 
the crime, but also noted that the testimony Thursday will force Simpson's camp 
to produce an explanation at some point: If Simpson did indeed buy the knife, 
can he produce it now, or is it missing? 
</P>
<P>
 That question has occupied detectives from the start as they have hunted in 
Los Angeles and Chicago, where Simpson flew via American Airlines the night of 
the killings, for the missing weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday night, American Airlines contacted Chicago police to alert them 
that a handle and part of a knife blade were found in a pit where lavatory 
waste from airliners is deposited. 
</P>
<P>
 0'hare Airport spokeswoman Lisa Howard said the knife, which had a curved 
handle and a fixed blade, was turned over to police and will be sent to Los 
Angeles. In testimony Thursday, Ross Cutlery co-owner Allen Wattenberg said 
Simpson had purchased a retractable blade knife with a straight handle. 
</P>
<P>
 As Wattenberg and Camacho were taking the stand Downtown, Los Angeles police 
detectives were scouring a vacant lot in Brentwood for the knife. Police 
Department officials declined to comment on the results of that search, which 
lasted more than three hours and featured police armed with metal detectors 
sweeping the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Other detectives were tooling through the tony neighborhood where Simpson 
lives, asking residents for permission to review video surveillance tapes from 
cameras that some homeowners have installed for security purposes. According to 
police sources, investigators are eager to see whether any of those cameras 
might include shots of Simpson returning to his home late that night and might 
pinpoint the exact time he returned. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, the much-awaited preliminary hearing was delayed for hours by long 
wrangling over an evidentiary motion, but finally began Thursday afternoon when 
prosecutors put Camacho and his boss at Ross Cutlery on the witness stand. The 
hearing resumes at 8:30 this morning. Tabloid Interview 
</P>
<P>
 Camacho and Wattenberg, one of the store owners, each gave detailed 
descriptions of the knife that they said Simpson bought in early May -- a 
bone-handled implement with a six-inch blade that sells for $74.98. Prosecutors 
displayed photographs of an identical knife, which Wattenberg and Camacho said 
the former football star chose after looking at a number of knives and after 
Wattenberg sharpened the blade for him. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to head off any damaging disclosures during cross-examination by 
Simpson's lawyers, prosecutor William Hodgman elicited from Camacho that he had 
sold his story to the National Enquirer. Wattenberg, under prosecution 
questioning, said he too expected to profit from the interview, although he 
said he had not been in town when Camacho agreed to the sale. The two men, 
along with Wattenberg's brother, said they expect to split $12,500 that the 
magazine offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Shapiro, Simpson's lead attorney, hammered on the payment in his 
cross-examination, accusing Camacho of selling his story to the highest bidder 
and reminding the witness that he had been warned, after testifying before the 
grand jury, not to speak publicly about the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, Camacho said, he was approached by various news outlets, including 
the National Enquirer. He said he refused interviews with some, and he told 
others that Simpson had browsed in the store but had not purchased a knife. 
Camacho testified that he decided to be honest with the Enquirer after the 
tabloid said it had another source and offered him money for the story. 
</P>
<P>
 In defending his actions, Camacho said an employee of the Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office named "Patti" had told him that he could talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I was told," said Camacho, who grew hesitant and fidgeted in his 
chair during Shapiro's cross-examination. "What else can I say?" 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Marcia Clark said after the hearing that "Patti" is Patti Jo 
Fairbanks, senior secretary in the special trials division. Clark, however, 
denied that Fairbanks gave Camacho approval to talk. "I was there," Clark said. 
"I can tell you that she did not tell him that he could talk to the press. I 
can guarantee you that 200%, absolutely." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Clark said she did not believe that the tabloid payments would 
seriously hamper the case. "People are human," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor, said the payments could undermine the 
credibility of those witnesses, but also noted that the accounts given by the 
two men corroborate each other. That may diminish the negative effect of the 
payments, he said, though adding that it could come back to haunt the 
prosecution if the Simpson case goes to trial, where the standard of proof is 
higher than at a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts the prosecution," Arenella said. "But it helps that they tell 
basically the same story." 
</P>
<P>
 The next witness was John DeBello, general manager of the restaurant where 
Goldman worked and where Nicole Simpson dined on the last night of her life. 
DeBello shed little new light on what was known about the case, but helped 
establish the time that Goldman left the restaurant, a fact that could prove 
significant as both sides try to determine exactly when the killings occurred 
and whether Simpson could have had time to commit the crimes and meet a 
limousine at his home that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson gave little hint at his reaction to the testimony Thursday, despite 
the swirl of emotions that his lawyers say he has battled. For the first time 
since his nationally televised arrest, he came to court wearing a tie -- a 
wardrobe change made possible because deputies have removed the suicide watch 
on him -- and he appeared more animated than in previous court appearances. He 
jotted notes during some of the testimony and occasionally leaned over to 
consult with Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few feet away, family members of Goldman and Nicole Simpson listened 
intently as the case against the superstar athlete began to unfold in court. 
Nicole Simpson's sisters were in the audience, wearing angel brooches similar 
to one that Nicole Simpson once wore. Their mother wore a similar piece of 
jewelry; one sister said it was the original on which the others were modeled. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman's father and stepmother sat side by side, her arm often draped over 
his shoulder as the two impassively listened to the day's testimony, which 
lasted more than four hours, interrupted by a long lunch break so Shapiro could 
attend a funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the day, neither the courtroom audience nor the millions of 
viewers tuned into live broadcasts worldwide saw much of the prosecution case. 
A long debate over blood and hair occupied the entire morning and much of the 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors prevailed on those issues, winning the right to conduct any tests 
they want on the blood samples as long as defense experts are allowed to attend 
the tests. Shapiro had asked that samples be split so that defense experts 
could conduct their own tests, but prosecutors, bolstered by the testimony of a 
police scientific analyst, argued that some of the samples are too small to 
divide. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro also resisted efforts by prosecutors to secure as many as 100 of 
Simpson's hairs, which they said were needed for comparison to hairs recovered 
from a blue knit cap found at the foot of one of the bodies. Although Shapiro 
proposed taking one hair from his client, Municipal Judge Kathleen 
Kennedy-Powell ruled that prosecutors may have 40 to 100 hairs to conduct those 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientific experts said those hairs may help investigators determine whether 
Simpson wore the hat. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is considerable variation across different parts of the scalp," said 
Dr. William C. Thompson, a criminology expert at UC Irvine. Hairs along the 
neckline, for example, are much finer than hairs from the top of the head. A 
larger number of hairs collected from his head would increase the likelihood of 
a match if, in fact, the hair found in the cap is Simpson's. Legal Wrangling 
</P>
<P>
 Issues such as scientific testing and obtaining hair samples are matters 
usually worked out informally between lawyers outside of court. But Shapiro and 
his legal team have mounted a concentrated attack on every aspect of the 
prosecution case, and legal experts saw the wrangling Thursday as an indication 
of how hard prosecutors will have to fight in their effort to put Simpson 
behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 With their case barely under way, prosecutors were granted a short delay in a 
battle that could deprive them of several dozen possible pieces of evidence -- 
including a bloody glove found outside Simpson's mansion. That dark brown work 
glove matches another one found at the murder scene, they said. Prosecutors 
hope to introduce the pair to show that Simpson was at the scene of the crime 
and then rushed home to meet a limousine, carelessly dropping the glove. 
</P>
<P>
 But Simpson's attorneys argued that the glove and 33 other items recovered 
from Simpson's home the day after the killings should be excluded because 
police improperly obtained the warrant allowing them to search his home, 
property and car. 
</P>
<P>
 In the affidavit used to secure that warrant, LAPD Detective Philip L. 
Vannatter said that he and his partner, Tom Lange, were assigned to investigate 
the killings at 4:30 a.m. June 13. Vannatter said that after the officers 
learned that one of the victims was Simpson's ex-wife, they went to his house 
on North Rockingham Avenue in Brentwood "in an attempt to make a notification." 
</P>
<P>
 The detective said that officers initially "were unable to arouse anyone at 
the residence." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the detectives observed a white Ford Bronco "parked at the west side 
of the residence" and that they "observed what appeared to be human blood . . . 
on the driver's door handle of the vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
 The affidavit says the detectives "aroused Simpson's daughter Arnell Simpson 
at the residence" and learned that he was not home. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police officers are allowed to make notification and are permitted to 
enter property without permission under certain circumstances, generally a 
warrant is required. According to defense lawyers, the officers did not have a 
warrant when they first went onto Simpson's property, and the football Hall of 
Famer's attorneys argue that the officers' initial observations of blood on the 
driveway and elsewhere were thus improper. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, his lawyers maintain that the request for the warrant includes a 
false statement because Vannatter stated that Simpson took an "unexpected 
flight to Chicago" shortly after the killings. Simpson's lawyers say officers, 
who had contacted the athlete in Chicago, knew that Simpson was on a planned 
business trip and argue that the warrant and any evidence seized under it are 
invalid. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Kennedy-Powell initially indicated that she would rule on the motion 
Thursday, but agreed to postpone her decision after prosecutors said they had a 
number of witnesses prepared to testify who would be inconvenienced if they had 
to be recalled. The motion instead will be discussed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 As the eagerly anticipated hearing got under way Thursday morning, Shapiro and 
lead prosecutor Clark sparred aggressively, sometimes resorting to sarcasm and 
accusing one another of playing to the vast television audience tuned in 
nationwide. Both sides in the case have been publicly outspoken as they seek to 
shape opinion in their favor. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Clark was handed an envelope and sought to share its contents 
with Shapiro. She did so in open court, handing it to Shapiro with a flourish 
though not revealing its contents to the audience. The gesture prompted him to 
remark: "It seems like a little bit of grandstanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, her voice sharp with sarcasm, retorted: "Excuse me, I can't believe I 
heard Mr. Shapiro say that." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson was not heard from at Thursday's hearing, but he appeared more 
attentive than he has been at some of the previous court sessions. He glanced 
around the room as the legal arguments unfolded, and nodded gently as Shapiro 
insisted on proceeding carefully with the case. Painstaking Questions 
</P>
<P>
 "I am representing a man charged with two murders where the people may be 
asking for the death penalty," Shapiro said gravely at one point. "If it takes 
two hours to determine whether or not there will be enough of a sample for an 
independent evaluation, where we believe samples can be contaminated, where 
false positives are possible, and where errors can take place in laboratory 
procedure, I don't think that's excessive at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Given permission by the judge to explore the issue of the samples in detail, 
Shapiro painstakingly questioned the assistant director of the Los Angeles 
Police Department's crime lab. 
</P>
<P>
 That witness, Michele Kestler, reviewed many of the government's 113 pieces of 
physical evidence and said a battery of tests are being performed on many of 
the items as investigators try to determine whether Simpson's blood and hair 
were found at the murder scene or whether the blood and hair of the victims 
might have been found at his house. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources have said that a blood type matching Simpson's was found at the scene, 
but prosecutors have not officially confirmed that. They are expected to 
present an array of blood test results as the preliminary hearing continues, 
however, and they said after Thursday's hearing that much more evidence will be 
forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tune in next week," Deputy Dist. Atty. Hodgman told reporters at the 
courthouse. "It will make more sense when we conclude it."

HOUSE, SENATE PANELS OK RIVAL HEALTH PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In a major step forward for the White House, the House Ways and Means 
Committee Thursday became the third congressional panel to approve a bill 
designed to achieve President Clinton's goal of providing health insurance for 
all Americans starting in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate Finance Committee, however, dealt a potentially devastating blow to 
Clinton's key proposal for universal coverage by rejecting any requirement that 
employers pay 80% of workers' insurance costs -- the so-called employer 
mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflicting votes foreshadowed a coming clash over the central issue in 
health reform -- the scope of coverage and how to pay for it -- and the uphill 
struggle facing Clinton and his allies as they try to persuade a majority of 
the House and Senate to support the employer mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 While even some ardent backers question whether the Ways and Means bill can 
pass the House in its present form, the hard-won, 20-18 endorsement by the 
influential panel provided some needed momentum for the President's drive for 
universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton called the bill's approval "a giant stride forward on the road to 
comprehensive health care" while White House aides minimized the setback for 
the Administration by the Senate Finance panel. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the President strongly attacked a rival plan put forward by 
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and 38 other Republican senators. The 
criticism came at a meeting with small business leaders at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does a little bit for the poor, it leaves all the powerful vested interest 
groups with everything they've got and it walks away from the middle class and 
small business," the President said of the GOP alternative, which would attempt 
to make health insurance more accessible through incentives. "It is politics as 
usual."  
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.), acting chairman of the Ways and Means panel, said 
the committee's bill, which would provide coverage of nearly all Americans by 
1998 and pay for it mostly by requiring employers and their employees to bear 
the cost, is an historic breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill will guarantee from birth to death . . . that all Americans will 
never lose their health care," Gibbons said after the vote. House Democratic 
leaders are expected to combine Gibbons' legislation with a similar measure 
approved by the House Education and Labor Committee and schedule a health care 
showdown in the full House for late July. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate Finance Committee, however, a strong majority balked at imposing 
an employer mandate -- even as a fallback -- if other measures do not succeed 
in achieving virtually universal coverage. All nine Republicans and five 
Democrats joined to strike that provision from a draft bill proposed by 
Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) on a 14-6 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the committee voted, 12 to 8, for an approach put forward by a group 
of moderate Republicans and conservative Democrats that would set up a 
government commission to make recommendations for expanding coverage if 95% of 
all Americans did not have health insurance by the year 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 The employer mandate is the linchpin of the Clinton plan and its chief means 
of assuring universal coverage. However, many business groups have fought it 
strenuously, arguing that it would force smaller firms to lay off workers or 
shut down completely. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the provision can be resurrected on the Senate floor is unclear but 
its rejection would limit the number of people who could be included in any 
health reform plan. "It's an oxymoron to say you're for universal coverage and 
not (for) a mandate," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), whose Labor and 
Human Resources Committee also passed a version of health care reform this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dole rejected any kind of mandate, saying: "The bottom line is that this 
is a tax." 
</P>
<P>
 The President's allies, however, argued that "shared responsibility" -- their 
more palatable term for the employer mandate -- is at the heart of health 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one should be misled," said Sen. Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.). "The 
alternative to shared responsibility is more responsibility on the family 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
 The finance panel also voted, 11 to 9, to drop Moynihan's cost containment 
plan that would require the government to set annual goals for increases in 
private health premiums but leave it up to Congress to decide what to do if 
prices were to rise faster. 
</P>
<P>
 It substituted a proposal, bitterly fought by organized labor, that would 
impose stiff taxes on health plans that are more costly than the average for 
their localities. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, another threat to House passage loomed as 35 House Democrats said 
that they would oppose any health care legislation that paid for elective 
abortions, according to the National Right to Life Committee Inc. Assuming that 
most if not all of the 178 House Republicans would vote against a 
Clinton-backed health care bill, this group of Democrats could be crucial to 
the bill's chances in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite potential obstacles, however, the Ways and Means Committee met its 
goal of approving comprehensive health care legislation before Congress' 4th of 
July recess. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are key provisions of the bill approved Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * All employers would be required to pay 80% of the cost of health insurance 
for employees, who would be required to pay the other 20%. Tax credits would 
lower costs for small firms with fewer than 50 workers, while businesses with 
more than 250 employees could decide to self-insure their work force. 
</P>
<P>
 * A tax increase on cigarettes of 45 cents a pack would be gradually phased in 
and a 2% tax on health insurance premiums would be imposed on insurance 
companies to help pay for the plan. In addition, the rate of growth in Medicare 
and Medicaid costs would be slowed in future years by limiting outlays. 
</P>
<P>
 * For those who do not work, a new government program to be called Medicare 
Part C would be set up to provide health benefits. Persons now receiving 
Medicaid also would be placed in this program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Medicare beneficiaries would be only slightly affected, although they would 
receive coverage for out-patient prescription drugs, colorectal screenings and 
additional mental health benefits. A new co-payment of 20% for home health 
services would be established to pay for the added benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Health plans would not be allowed to deny coverage to anyone, to cancel 
coverage, to exclude those with pre-existing conditions or to charge higher 
premiums to people because they are older or because of their medical 
histories. 
</P>
<P>
 * The standard benefit package would include coverage for hospital and 
out-patient services, including prescription drugs, mental health and substance 
abuse treatments, although there would be some co-payments or deductibles.  
</P>
<P>
 * Those covered would be able to select a plan that would include choice of 
doctors, including those covered by Medicare Part C. 
</P>
<P>
 * An overall cap on out-of-pocket payments of $5,500 a year for individuals 
and $11,000 for families would start in the year 2003. 
</P>
<P>
 * Health insurance would have to be provided in three categories -- for 
individuals, single parents and couples with children. Ways and Means experts 
estimated that health insurance would cost workers between $35 and $95 a month, 
depending on family status. 
</P>
<P>
 * Employers' payments would range from $1.71 an hour for an individual to 
$4.53 an hour for a family. 
</P>
<P>
 * Everyone below a certain income level -- approximately $16,800 for an 
individual and $24,000 for a family of three -- would receive federal help in 
paying premiums. Some low-income people receiving welfare benefits would not 
have to pay for insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 * Self-employed people would be able to take a tax deduction for 80% of the 
cost of their health insurance, compared to 25% allowed under current law.

YEARLY PRICE OF ANTI-SMOG PLAN COULD TOP $5 BILLION; POLLUTION: PROPOSAL COULD 
SLOW JOB CREATION BY 63,000 POSITIONS A YEAR. BUT IMPACT IS CALLED RELATIVELY 
MINOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The latest proposal for cleaning Southern California's smoggy skies could cost 
more than $5 billion annually and slow new employment by 63,000 jobs a year, 
posing slightly more of an economic burden than previous plans to curb the 
region's notorious air pollution, according to an economic analysis completed 
Thursday by air quality officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, achieving clean air would cost almost $1 per person in Los Angeles, 
Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties every day through 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast Air Quality Management District officials have called their latest 
smog control proposal, unveiled in April and scheduled for a vote in August, 
more business-friendly, flexible and economical than past versions. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite their efforts to curtail costs and spread the burden, air quality 
officials say a daunting price tag and slower job growth is unavoidable given 
the region's severe pollution. The $5.4-billion annual cost is a worst-case 
scenario, they say, explaining that it does not include new market incentives 
and pollution trading programs proposed by the agency to defray part of the 
expense for local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan's 106 proposed measures -- which would be implemented by local, state 
and federal officials -- include improved mass transit, electric car mandates, 
pollution fees on ships and cleaner solvents and paints.  
</P>
<P>
 The smog cleanup bill would be equivalent to 2% of the gross value of goods 
and services in the four counties, and the slowdown in annual job growth 
amounts to around half of 1% of the 10 million jobs that should exist by 2010, 
according to the AQMD's report. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at the big picture, it has a relatively small impact on the 
local economy," said AQMD Deputy Executive Officer Barry Wallerstein. "We know 
the issue of job impact is much more sensitive now, at the end of a recession, 
than in good times. But the bottom line is the same -- that the relative impact 
on the regional economy is minor." 
</P>
<P>
 More than three-quarters of the costs -- as well as the benefits of clean air 
-- would fall on Los Angeles County, which has the vast majority of cars, 
refineries and other smog-causing sources, according to the report. About 14% 
would be incurred in Orange County, 5% in San Bernardino County and 4% in 
Riverside County.  
</P>
<P>
 Ray Remy, president of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, called the 
economic report "an absolute dream come true" for every city trying to lure 
industries away from the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 "When every effort is being made to try to build a better business climate and 
image, how can you get excited about a report that proclaims we will have a 
$5.4-billion reduction in our economy and lose 63,000 jobs?" Remy said. 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD officials, however, emphasize that keeping the air dirty would be even 
more expensive than cleaning it up. 
</P>
<P>
 The region would save $6.3 billion to $6.9 billion per year due to fewer 
pollution-related deaths, reduced health care costs, improved traffic, enhanced 
visibility and other benefits. The net annual savings is about $1 billion 
compared to the costs, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic benefits of clean air always have been disputed, however, since 
estimates are based largely on economists who assign a value of around $3.5 
million for each person who dies prematurely from air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over the plan will culminate Aug. 12, when the AQMD board convenes 
a final public hearing and decides its fate. A revised clean air plan is 
required by law every three years. Under federal law, the AQMD and the state 
Air Resources Board have until November to approve an updated plan.  
</P>
<P>
 Since the local agencies have failed to meet past clean air deadlines, the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also has proposed a strategy for the Los 
Angeles Basin that has prompted even more concern among business and civic 
leaders. If the local agencies come up with better alternatives, federal 
officials have said they would soften harsher aspects of their plan, such as 
fees on the shipping industry and pollution limits on airline flights. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the AQMD plan, the costs of clean air would be borne by virtually 
everyone -- motorists, consumers, local industries and interstate businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Economist Sue Lieu, an AQMD program supervisor, said Southland industrial 
plants would bear 36% of the annual expenses, while 51% of the cost would be 
for controls on cars and other vehicles that use roads and 13% for vehicles 
such as airliners and farm equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 By far, the single biggest expense -- $1.5 billion per year -- would come out 
of the pockets of consumers for public transportation improvements, including 
enhanced rail and bus service, car-pool lanes and freeway maintenance. Those 
congestion-relief projects already have been authorized by transportation 
agencies, so they could be implemented regardless of the outcome of the AQMD's 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Substantial expenses -- an estimated $99.5 million annually -- could also be 
paid by the construction industry, and by the passenger transit industry -- $61 
million per year. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic analysis shows the total annual cost, when adjusted for 
inflation, would be about $60 million less than the plan adopted in 1991. But 
the job loss would be worse -- by 5,000 positions per year -- largely because 
improved forecasting techniques were used, Lieu said. 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD officials, however, contend they have not factored in savings for local 
businesses from expanding the agency's "smog market," which allows buying and 
selling of pollution credits. The region's major oil, aerospace and other 
manufacturing industries consider the trading market less onerous and costly 
than traditional smog-control rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "The '94 plan is designed for the dual goal of clean air and a healthy 
economy," Wallerstein said. "The fact that we haven't received a lot of 
negative comments to date about this plan is reflective of the flexibility and 
new types of initiatives in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, the plan would buy a 5% decrease in all smog-causing pollutants in 
the four counties, with 75% eliminated by 2010. Under that scenario, the entire 
Los Angeles Basin then would meet all health standards for air pollution as 
required by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Remy acknowledged that the basin still has a long way to go to clean up its 
smog, but said "it has got to be done somewhat within the realm of economic 
reality" or ultimately the state's tax base and such services as education will 
suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the overall job loss, some industries would gain jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Complying with new smog rules would generate around 38,000 new jobs in the 
basin, but eliminate 101,201 other potential new ones -- a net loss of 63,049, 
according to the report. In comparison, the Southland lost about 475,000 jobs 
to the recession between 1990 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The report predicts the major job losers will be the health care industry, 
since there would be fewer pollution-related illnesses such as asthma, and 
retail services, since consumers would have less to spend. 
</P>
<P>
 A beneficiary, Wallerstein said, could be the hard-hit aerospace industry, 
which could shift to producing advanced transportation technologies such as 
electric cars. 
</P>
<P>
 But business leaders fear that some of the rules on interstate commerce -- 
such as a hotly debated fee on ships each time they dock and caps on airline 
pollution -- would leave the Los Angeles region unable to compete with other 
major commercial hubs. 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD economists, however, believe the impact on competitiveness would be 
minor. Exports and imports would be reduced by less than half of 1% annually, 
the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the cost estimate is tenuous because the cost of 60 of the plan's 106 
measures cannot be quantified yet and had to be roughly estimated at $3.4 
billion annually.

JUSTICES UPHOLD CALIFORNIA DEATH PENALTY STATUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court upheld California's death penalty law against a broad 
constitutional attack on Thursday, sparing state prosecutors the huge headache 
of seeking new sentencing hearings for the 388 convicted killers who sit on the 
state's Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
 By an 8-1 vote, the justices said jurors in California are given enough 
"common-sense" guidance to choose between sentencing a murderer to death or to 
life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 "The states may adopt capital sentencing processes that rely upon the jury, in 
its sound judgment, to exercise wide discretion," Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that conclusion seems reasonable, it conflicts with opinions in other 
recent death penalty cases that set strict standards for capital punishment in 
the Southern states. Indeed, Thursday's ruling tried to clear up confusion that 
the Supreme Court itself had created. 
</P>
<P>
 Just two years ago, in an another opinion written by Kennedy, the justices 
struck down part of Mississippi's death penalty law because it failed to guide 
sentencing jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the court used a scale as a model. Jurors must weigh aggravating factors 
and mitigating factors, it said. If the aggravating factors outweigh the 
mitigating factors, the killer gets a death sentence. Otherwise, it would be 
life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking for a 6-3 majority in the Mississippi case, Kennedy said it is now "a 
well-settled principle: Use of a vague or imprecise aggravating factor in the 
weighing process invalidates the sentence." That is so, he said, because 
allowing jurors to weigh "an illusory circumstance" would unfairly put a "thumb 
. . . on death's side of the scale." In that case, the disputed circumstance 
was the prosecutor's contention that the murder was "heinous, atrocious and 
cruel." 
</P>
<P>
 California's law has wording similar to Mississippi's statute. Jurors are told 
that they "shall impose a sentence of death if (they) conclude that the 
aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, defense lawyers cited the Mississippi decision in their 
appeals on behalf of Death Row inmates. Acting on two such appeals, the 
justices in January announced that they would hear a broad challenge to the 
California law. 
</P>
<P>
 One appeal was filed on behalf of Paul P. Tuilaepa, who in 1986 shot four men 
in a Long Beach bar and killed one of them. Los Angeles County prosecutor 
William Hodgman called Tuilaepa a "menacing figure and fearsome killer." 
</P>
<P>
 The second appeal was filed on behalf of William Proctor, who in 1982 had 
raped, tortured and murdered a Shasta County schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Both appeals argued that the California law allowed jurors to weigh vague 
factors, such as the "circumstance of the crime" and the age of the defendant. 
Since it is hard to weigh something as definite as age or the circumstances of 
the crime, the law should be deemed unconstitutional, they argued. 
</P>
<P>
 But in its opinion Thursday in Tuilaepa vs. California, 93-5131, the high 
court barely mentioned the Mississippi case and dropped its references to 
weighing matters on a scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a person is convicted of murder with "special circumstances" under 
California law, "the jury then is free to consider a myriad of factors to 
determine whether death is the appropriate punishment," Kennedy wrote. "Indeed, 
the sentencer (jury) may be given unbridled discretion in determining whether 
the death penalty should be imposed." 
</P>
<P>
 In a concurring opinion, Justice David H. Souter commented that decisions 
about the death penalty are "not susceptible to mathematical precision." 
</P>
<P>
 California Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren expressed "a great relief" at the outcome. 
He said the ruling reaffirms his belief that California's death penalty law is 
"fair and reasonable, and that penalties in these cases have been justly 
imposed." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same old thing: You run up against the too-much-murder rule," said 
attorney Howard Gillingham of North Hollywood, who represented Tuilaepa in his 
appeal. "They don't want to overturn 200 or 300 cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy C. Lascher, the Ventura attorney who represented Proctor, remains 
convinced that the state's jury instructions are not sufficiently precise. 
"It's as if the judge says, 'We're going to tell you the instructions', but the 
instructions might as well be in Russian," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers said Tuilaepa and Proctor have several more steps in their appeals 
before they face an execution date. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in a second death penalty ruling, the high court on a 5-4 vote said 
federal judges can intervene to block an execution before a defendant has filed 
a writ in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling settles an abstract question of federal jurisdiction that took on 
practical significance recently in Texas. There, prosecutors move swiftly to 
execute Death Row inmates as soon as their final appeals are rejected in the 
state's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Frank McFarland, a federal judge said he had no authority to 
stop the execution to give defense lawyers enough time to file a writ of habeas 
corpus in federal court. The U.S Court of Appeals in Texas agreed, raising the 
possibility that an inmate could die before a federal court could examine the 
substance of his appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 But in McFarland vs. Collins, 93-6497, the high court said federal judges are 
empowered to grant a stay of execution to allow time for the filing of a 
federal appeal. 
</P>

THE TIMES POLL; AFTER 1 YEAR, MAYOR GETS GOOD MARKS; RIORDAN ENJOYS A BROAD 59% 
APPROVAL RATING. BUT MOST RESIDENTS STILL WORRY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE CITY 
AND ITS ECONOMY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Most Los Angeles residents approve of the way Mayor Richard Riordan is 
handling his job after one year in office, although a majority still feel that 
things are going badly in the city, the Los Angeles Times Poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan enjoys the support of a broad spectrum of Angelenos -- regardless of 
where they live, how much money they make or their political party affiliation. 
His standing among blacks, however, is weaker than among other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 As Riordan marks his first anniversary in office today, he has a 59% approval 
rating and a 24% disapproval mark. That is up from the 45% approval rating in 
October and makes him more popular than the Los Angeles City Council (40%), but 
less popular than Police Chief Willie L. Williams (73%). Former Mayor Tom 
Bradley, shortly after the 1984 Olympics, hit his all-time high approval rating 
of 75%, as measured by The Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll also found that much of Riordan's positive rating is based less on 
specific achievement and policy initiatives than on a sense of goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a healthy, but not stellar, rating," Times Poll Director John Brennan 
said. "A lot of it is based on a general good feeling. But if people simply 
like you, that's not a bad thing for a politician. That gets a lot of votes." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 1,023 residents of the city of Los Angeles last 
weekend. The margin of sampling error for the entire survey is plus or minus 
four percentage points and somewhat higher for some subgroups. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey showed that Angelenos' bleak image of their city is continuing to 
improve, although most people still do not have a positive outlook. While 59% 
said things are going badly in Los Angeles, 38% said the city is doing well. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinions about the city bottomed out shortly after riots swept Los Angeles in 
1992, with 85% of residents taking a negative view. 
</P>
<P>
 The public's view of the local economy is also on the mend, though it is still 
not good. The number of those who describe the economy as "shaky" has dropped 
from 92% after the riots to 79% this week. And nearly one-third of those 
surveyed expected the economy to be improved three months from now, nearly four 
times the number who say it will be worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan came to City Hall as a neophyte to elected office, but had years of 
experience as a behind-the-scenes power player in the city's top political, 
philanthropic and social circles. 
</P>
<P>
 Since taking office, his awkward public speaking style and affable demeanor 
have apparently won over much of a populace that is weary of slick politicians. 
The 64-year-old multimillionaire has warmed to public appearances that he once 
predicted he would shun. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he had been painted as a right-wing ideologue during the mayoral 
race, Riordan has been widely credited with sidestepping philosophical 
struggles during his first year. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's insistence on fast action by city officials after the January 
earthquake and subsequent collegial relationship with top Clinton 
Administration officials have been seen as aiding the city's recovery from that 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan also won praise, and passage, of most of his first budget, which set 
aside $83 million for a plan to expand the police force and made modest 
additions to other programs. The planned additions came despite a lackluster 
local economy and stagnant city tax receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the police expansion has been thrown into limbo because funds that 
Riordan built into the budget have not materialized and other money must be set 
aside to pay police officers more money. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's Administration has stumbled in other areas -- including the loss of 
two deputy mayors early in his term. One of them, Al Villalobos, quit after The 
Times reported about his checkered career as a financial consultant, his 
gambling debts and his ties to a man who was convicted on federal bribery 
charges. Villalobos was not charged with a crime in that case. He said he left 
his post as the mayor's chief for economic development to return to the private 
sector and spend more time with his family. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor also admitted that he had made a mistake in approving a 9% pay raise 
for Department of Water and Power workers, an increase that became a rallying 
point for police officers in their long and nasty contract dispute with City 
Hall. That contest was settled this week with a raise, amounting to as much as 
12% over 18 months, which was backed by Riordan but criticized by others as too 
costly. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the major landmarks of Riordan's first year have made little 
impression on the public, the poll found. 
</P>
<P>
 When those who approve of Riordan were asked why, more than one-fourth said 
they "just liked him" for no particular reason. Smaller numbers of respondents 
back him because they consider him a good leader, or believe that he gets 
things done and that he has not made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Just 2% cited Riordan's plan to hire more police, the central theme of his 
first year, as the reason for their support. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far he hasn't done anything wrong. I think he is on the right track," said 
Chad Sripanich, 45, a supermarket manager who lives in the San Fernando Valley. 
Sripanich said he also approves of the Republican mayor's extensive use of 
Democrats in his Administration. "I think he is bringing diversity into his 
government; more of them should do that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Lobos, 24, who works in aerospace sales, credited Riordan with 
responding well after the earthquake. In general, Lobos said he gives the mayor 
the benefit of the doubt but believes "he hasn't improved the city or made it 
any worse. I don't really think you can fix L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor fares favorably when compared to city government in general. Only 
40% approve of the Los Angeles City Council, with 35% disapproving. And nearly 
three-quarters of those surveyed said they only occasionally or hardly ever 
trust city government to do what is right. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's support is highest among the groups that helped propel him to 
victory over City Councilman Michael Woo -- Republicans (76% approval rating), 
whites (69%), San Fernando Valley residents (73%) and those who make more than 
$60,000 a year (65%). But the poll showed that he now also has majority support 
from Democrats (54%), those with incomes of less than $20,000 a year (56%) and 
from two other broad geographic regions -- the Westside (63%) and central Los 
Angeles (51%). Even in the southern section, more approve of Riordan (50%) than 
disapprove (33%). 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's standing also has improved markedly since October among Latinos. At 
that time, his approval rating was 34%, but jumped to 58% this week. 
</P>
<P>
 His poorest standing is in the black community, not a surprise considering 
that he earned only 14% of the black vote in his contest with Woo, according to 
a Times exit poll. Although his approval rating among blacks stood at 40% last 
fall and remains about that level, the number of blacks who disapprove of his 
performance has jumped from 19% to 36%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, to me, we don't have any jobs and the situation hasn't changed, 
not even a little," said Lynnett Craig, 29, a South-Central Los Angeles 
student. "I was hoping that him being a successful businessman, that he would 
work around the regulations and bring business in, but he hasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Hawkins, 38, said he also remains skeptical of the city government's 
ability to beef up the police force -- a situation that he blamed on both 
Riordan and the City Council. "They should be replaced too," Hawkins said of 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 24% of Angelenos citywide who gave Riordan a negative rating, many also 
did not cite specific reasons. The most common explanations by detractors were 
that they just do not like the mayor, that he treated the police union unfairly 
or believe that he cannot get things done. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan touted his experience as a businessman and lawyer during his campaign, 
but feelings are mixed about how much good that has done him in public office. 
More than one-third said the business savvy has helped his work as mayor, 11% 
said it has hurt and more than half said it had little effect or they did not 
have an opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor has not yet succeeded in selling his concept of having private firms 
compete to provide some city services, the poll found. Forty-five percent of 
those surveyed oppose the idea of privatizing city services, while 40% approve 
of the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's rating puts him in roughly the same political territory as his 
fellow Republican mayor, Rudolph Giuliani of New York. A New York 
Newsday-WABC-TV poll last month found Giuliani with a slightly higher positive 
rating (63%) than Riordan, but with a higher negative rating (31%) too. How the 
Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 1,023 adult residents of the city of Los Angeles by 
telephone Saturday and Sunday. Telephone numbers were chosen from a list of all 
exchanges in the city. Random-digit dialing techniques were used so that listed 
and non-listed numbers could be contacted. Interviewing was conducted in 
English and Spanish. The sample was weighted slightly to conform with census 
figures for sex, race, age and education. The margin of sampling error for the 
total sample is plus or minus 4 percentage points. For certain other subgroups 
the error margin may be somewhat higher. Poll results can also be affected by 
other factors such as question wording and the order in which questions are 
presented. Riordan's Approval Rating 
</P>
<P>
 One year into his term, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan gets a healthy 59% 
job approval score, up from 45% last October. Most people still call the city's 
economy shaky, but feelings are better than they were a year ago.

ABORTION CLINIC BUFFER AGAINST PROTEST UPHELD; SUPREME COURT: LIMITED BAN TO 
PRESERVE PATIENTS' RIGHTS DOES NOT VIOLATE FIRST AMENDMENT, JUSTICES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a victory for abortion rights advocates, the Supreme Court said Thursday 
that judges and lawmakers can create a "buffer zone" around an abortion clinic 
and prevent protesters from picketing and chanting on the street and sidewalks 
in front of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 This limited ban on peaceful protest does not violate the First Amendment's 
guarantee of freedom of speech, the court ruled on a 6-3 vote, as long as it is 
deemed necessary to preserve the patient's right to freely enter a clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Florida judge went too far, the court said, when he barred protesters 
from holding up photos of aborted fetuses and prohibited them from seeking to 
speak with any patient or staff member within 300 feet of a clinic in 
Melbourne, Fla. Those restrictions on free speech "sweep more broadly than 
necessary" to protect access to the clinic and therefore are unconstitutional, 
the justices said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was one of several announced on the last day of the high court's 
1993-94 term. In other rulings, the justices: 
</P>
<P>
 * Limited the 1965 Voting Rights Act by ruling that states need not create the 
maximum possible number of legislative seats for blacks and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 * Struck down a $52-million contempt fine assessed against the United Mine 
Workers and said such criminal-like punishments can only be imposed by a jury, 
not by a judge alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's opinion in the abortion protest case is likely to have a wide 
impact, not only on the continuing battle over abortion, but also on emerging 
areas of street protests, such as those by AIDS activists who have targeted 
Catholic church officials and by animal-rights advocates who have tried to shut 
medical research labs. 
</P>
<P>
 When faced with aggressive and persistent protesters, judges have been forced 
to draw a line dividing protected free speech from illegal harassment and 
interference with the rights of others. Thursday's ruling (Madsen vs. Women's 
Health Center, 93-880) marks the high court's first detailed pronouncement on 
the issue, which has arisen in scores of cases involving abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 The case arose from the long-running battle outside the Aware Woman Center in 
Melbourne, on the central Florida coast south of Cape Canaveral. The leaders of 
Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group, had pledged to shut the clinic 
through round-the-clock protests. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic's owner complained that her patients and staff suffered under "mob 
rule." But the abortion opponents said the First Amendment protected their 
right to picket, pray and chant on the street and the sidewalk next to the 
clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, faced with evidence that the protesters were continually impeding 
patients' right to enter the clinic, a state judge imposed a broad injunction. 
It created a 36-foot buffer zone outside the clinic's driveway. Police were 
told to arrest any protester who picketed, prayed or even walked in that area. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also barred loud chanting during surgical hours and prohibited the 
display of signs and photos that might upset patients. In addition, he said 
protesters must stay 300 feet from the homes of the clinic's patients and 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing for the court, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist upheld part of the 
injunction and struck down other parts. In doing so, he announced several 
important clarifications of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 First, a judge's order is not unconstitutional simply because it targets a 
particular group of protesters and restricts their free-speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
 An injunction "by its very nature" targets people who probably are attempting 
to convey a similar message, Rehnquist said. Abortion protesters were targeted 
at the Florida clinic, he said, not because of "their anti-abortion message 
(but) because they repeatedly violated" earlier court orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, injunctions can be upheld if they are no broader "than necessary to 
serve a significant governmental interest." In this case, officials had "a 
strong interest in protecting a woman's freedom to seek lawful medical and 
counseling services in connection with her pregnancy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, any person whose words or actions "could be interpreted as threats or 
veiled threats" is not protected from punishment under the First Amendment, 
Rehnquist declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Most states, including California, recently have enacted laws against 
"stalking." But some legal experts have questioned whether it is constitutional 
to make it a crime to follow someone or to harass them with unwanted comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Rehnquist's opinion suggests that anti-stalking laws can be upheld when there 
is evidence of threatening behavior. However, he also struck down part of the 
Melbourne injunction that protected clinic workers from being stalked or 
"shadowed" at all times and in all locations, calling this too broad an 
infringement on free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absent evidence that the protesters' speech . . . is infused with violence . 
. . or a threat of physical harm," it cannot be made illegal, the chief justice 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth, injunctions can restrict noise levels to protect the welfare of 
patients but cannot restrict signs and posters. "It is much easier for the 
clinic to pull up its curtains than for a patient to stop up her ears," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth, an injunction can ban "targeted residential picketing" directly in 
front of a doctor's home but it cannot go so far as to prohibit any picketing 
in the neighborhood. The Melbourne injunction went too far, he said, when it 
barred any protest activities within 300 feet of an employee's residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers said the ruling appears to clear up any constitutional doubts about 
the newly enacted federal law designed to protect access to abortion clinics. 
The law, signed by President Clinton in spring, makes it a federal crime to 
block access to a clinic or to intimidate women seeking abortions. The law 
already has been challenged on free-speech grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's ruling "is a slam-dunk win for women, doctors and health care 
workers," said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation, 
which helped defend the Melbourne clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for anti-abortion protesters said the ruling has "devastating 
consequences for the pro-life movement." 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of today's Supreme Court opinion has transformed public sidewalks 
normally open for expressive activity into a type of Tian An Men Square," said 
Mat Staver, an Orlando, Fla., attorney who represented the three abortion 
protesters who had challenged the injunction. 
</P>
<P>
 In a vehement dissent, which he read from the bench, Justice Antonin Scalia 
accused his colleagues of making abortion protesters a "disfavored class" who 
were not accorded the same free-speech protections as labor picketers and civil 
rights protesters. Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas joined in 
Scalia's dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rehnquist and Scalia are usually linked as the conservative leaders 
of the high court, they have differed often on the First Amendment.  
</P>
<P>
 The chief justice usually sides with the government, regardless of the issue, 
but Scalia has often insisted on broad protection for free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, Scalia cast a key vote to strike down laws against 
flag-burning as a violation of free expression, while Rehnquist dissented 
strongly. Earlier this week, Rehnquist cast a key vote to uphold some 
regulation of cable television, while Scalia said he would strike down the 
rules as a violation of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling in the mine worker's case also involved a challenge to a judge's 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 9-0 decision, the justices put new limits on the power of judges to issue 
fines for contempt. Although judges can force an organization to pay for losses 
it has caused, they cannot punish someone without a jury trial, the court said 
in the case (International Union vs. Bagwell, 92-1625).

HAUNTED BY COLOSIO; CANDIDATE'S SLAYING SHADOWS MEXICO'S ZEDILLO ON TIJUANA 
VISIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Ernesto Zedillo, the ruling party candidate in the closely fought and volatile 
race for the Mexican presidency, Thursday brought his campaign to potentially 
hostile territory: Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
 The border state is a bastion of the opposition National Action Party (PAN), 
whose hard-charging standard-bearer, Diego Fernandez, has emerged in many polls 
as the main challenger to Zedillo's Institutional Revolutionary Party, widely 
known as the PRI, which has ruled Mexico for 65 years. 
</P>
<P>
 And here more than anywhere in Mexico, the ghost of slain PRI candidate Luis 
Donaldo Colosio haunts the Zedillo campaign. The assassination of Colosio at a 
March 23 rally in Tijuana catapulted Zedillo, a reserved, 43-year-old 
economist, into the role of replacement candidate for an increasingly fractious 
party that confronts an unprecedented threat. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech at a sweltering union hall in the port city of Ensenada, the 
bespectacled Zedillo made it clear that the border state represents a key 
battlefield in the Aug. 21 national election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am committed to leading our party to a triumph here in Baja California," 
Zedillo said, his open-necked shirt drenched with sweat, reminding the crowd 
that he grew up in Mexicali and saying he hopes to retire to the coast of 
Ensenada one day. 
</P>
<P>
 This regional appeal could help Zedillo make incursions into the PAN's power 
base in an unusually close national race with Fernandez and fellow challenger 
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD). Although the 
PRI has been battered by crises -- the Colosio assassination, an armed uprising 
in Chiapas, drug violence, corruption -- its political machine remains 
formidable, according to Tonatiuh Guillen Lopez, a political scientist at the 
College of the Northern Border in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a race where the margin of victory will be small, Zedillo's regional 
appeal could be significant," Guillen said. "Ironically, the PRI benefits from 
the fact that both opposition parties are strong. They could neutralize one 
another." 
</P>
<P>
 Politics notwithstanding, small but unmistakable reminders of the Colosio case 
marked Zedillo's path in Baja. Zedillo made a quick pilgrimage Wednesday night 
to the site of the assassination in the canyon shantytown of Lomas Taurinas, 
where he repeated his calls for justice. Ensenada supporters chanted Colosio's 
name Thursday, describing Zedillo as the man who had picked up the torch of his 
fallen predecessor. The candidate's security guards were numerous and vigilant. 
</P>
<P>
 However, less than four months after a slaying that many Mexicans attribute to 
a plot within the ruling party, the profile of the Colosio case seems to be 
fading. Despite its profound impact on Tijuana, the assassination was not 
mentioned during a live television interview Wednesday night in which Zedillo 
talked at length about improving tourism and ensuring that Mexican milk can 
compete in the era of free trade. 
</P>
<P>
 And a crowd of well-wishers pushed very close to Zedillo after the Ensenada 
speech, shaking his hand, giving him campaign posters to autograph and planting 
kisses on his cheek. The scene seemed uncomfortably reminiscent of the moments 
before Colosio was shot, but PRI stalwarts said afterward that the candidate 
faced no danger in Ensenada. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fight must go on!" one woman shouted. "He will win. God protect him." 
</P>
<P>
 Official efforts to shift public attention from Colosio appear to be working, 
according to political scientist Guillen. 
</P>
<P>
 The public focus on Zedillo's bid derives from a traditional of heavily 
concentrated power in the Mexican presidency. "It is a product of Mexican 
presidential (politics): 'The king is dead, long live the king,' " Guillen 
said, adding that he does not expect breakthroughs in the much-criticized 
investigation of the Colosio murder before the August election. 
</P>
<P>
 During other campaign stops, Zedillo sounded themes consistent with his 
attempt to reinvent his party as a modernizing, reformist force. He called for 
a redistribution of power from the federal government to state and city 
authorities -- a dramatic change in the heavily centralized Mexican system and 
a frequent demand of the PAN. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo urged sweeping law enforcement reforms, calling lawlessness the 
nation's gravest problem. And he mixed his feisty predictions of victory with a 
conciliatory tone, promising to work closely with opposition governments in 
Baja if he is elected.

STATE HIGH COURT CLEARS WAY FOR SUIT OVER JOE CAMEL ADS; SMOKING: PLAINTIFF 
CLAIMS R.J. REYNOLDS TOBACCO CO. USES THE POPULAR CARTOON MASCOT TO SELL 
CIGARETTES TO MINORS. IN A SEPARATE CASE, JURISTS AGREE TO CONSIDER REINSTATING 
CAMPAIGN DONATION LIMITS.

 In a ruling hailed by anti-smoking activists, the state Supreme Court said 
Thursday that California and its citizens can sue tobacco companies over 
advertising campaigns that allegedly target teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's decision permits a San Francisco woman to proceed with her lawsuit 
against the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., which she accuses of improperly wooing 
children with its Joe Camel mascot, emblazoned on items ranging from T-shirts 
to beverage can holders. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Mangini, a family law attorney who is suing as a private citizen, claims 
the Joe Camel ads violate the state's ban on unfair business practices by 
encouraging minors to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to avoid a trial, R.J. Reynolds argued that only the federal government 
can regulate its advertising. The court disagreed, saying that federal law does 
not bar states from controlling cigarette promotions -- and in fact encourages 
states to prevent minors from lighting up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congress left the states free to exercise their police power to protect 
minors from advertising that encourages them to break the law," Justice Armand 
Arabian wrote in the court's unanimous decision. Mangini, he said, may not be 
blocked by a "nicotine wall of congressional preemption." 
</P>
<P>
 William Lerach, an attorney for Mangini, said he was delighted with the 
decision. "We will now have the opportunity to prove what we know to be true -- 
that this advertising campaign unlawfully targets minors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Chartoff, who filed a friend-of-the-court brief for Mangini on behalf 
of former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, praised the court for "seeing 
through the legal smoke screen raised by the tobacco industry." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased that the court has challenged R.J. Reynolds' right to exploit 
children, induce them to break the law and expose them to disease, disability 
and death," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Winston-Salem, N.C., a spokeswoman for R.J. Reynolds called the ruling 
"merely procedural" and said the tobacco giant will continue its Joe Camel 
advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are extremely confident that the fact that this campaign is directed at 
adult smokers will prevail in the end," said the spokeswoman, Peggy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Introduced in 1988, the Joe Camel character was initially used for the 75th 
anniversary of the brand. Wildly popular, the smirking cartoon mascot now 
appears on beach towels, baseball caps, windbreakers and numerous other items 
that can be had for free in exchange for proof-of-purchase receipts. Recently, 
Joe has been joined by a bunch of Josies, who are depicted as smoking Camels 
around a pool table in a bar. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Mangini's lawsuit, Camel sales to teen-agers surged from $6 
million to $476 million in the four years after the debonair dromedary was 
introduced. Moreover, a 1991 survey by the Journal of the American Medical 
Assn. -- a survey heartily disputed by the tobacco industry -- found that some 
6-year-olds were nearly as familiar with Joe Camel as with Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I find it outrageous that this character who is an advocate for 
smoking has such recognition among children," Mangini said in an interview. 
"This is a hip and happening camel, with all the accouterments that young teens 
would want. By using it, R.J. Reynolds is being very irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-smoking advocates called Thursday's decision a major defeat for the 
tobacco industry. They noted that in early June, the Federal Trade Commission 
declined to take action against Joe Camel, concluding that there was 
insufficient evidence of a link between the character and teen-age smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, the FTC showed they were spineless and lacked the courage to act," 
said James Bergman, executive director of the group Stop Teen-age Addiction to 
Tobacco. "That's why the courts are becoming increasingly important. They are 
much less vulnerable to the wealth and power of the tobacco industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Mangini said she hopes her case will come to trial in San Francisco within a 
year. In addition to seeking a ban on the Joe Camel campaign, she wants R.J. 
Reynolds to forfeit to the state millions of dollars in profits obtained since 
the character's debut and to produce ads telling children that "smoking is not 
cool." 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate case Thursday that could have dramatic ramifications for 
California politics, the court agreed to consider whether to reinstate campaign 
contribution limits invalidated by a federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 The limits -- $1,000 for individuals and $5,000 for political action 
committees -- were part of Proposition 73, passed by 58% of the state's voters 
in 1988. The measure was adopted amid mounting criticism that the huge volume 
of campaign cash contributed by special-interest groups was having a corrupting 
influence on lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 While in effect, Proposition 73 had a significant impact, reducing the amount 
of campaign contributions to legislative races from $40 million in the 1988 
election to $23.9 million in 1990. But in 1992, it was ruled unconstitutional 
by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, state Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco) asked the 
state Supreme Court to correct any unconstitutional provisions of the measure 
and reinstate the law. Thursday, the court agreed to at least take a look. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just delighted," said Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Placentia), an author 
of Proposition 73 who joined Kopp in petitioning the court. "I think this is 
potentially the best news for campaign finance reform since the passage of 
Proposition 73."

1,364 ADDITIONAL BRIDGES ARE PUT ON RETROFIT LIST; EARTHQUAKES: CALTRANS REPORT 
SAYS 302 HIGHWAY STRUCTURES NEEDING SEISMIC STRENGTHENING ARE IN L.A. COUNTY. 
PLANS CALL FOR AN ACCELERATED SCHEDULE THAT WOULD BE COMPLETED BY 1997.

<P>
 Revealing that far more highway overpasses are vulnerable to earthquake damage 
than once thought, state transportation officials announced Thursday that an 
additional 1,364 bridges will need strengthening to withstand a major temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest number of highway structures newly discovered to be in need of 
retrofitting -- 302 -- are in Los Angeles County, where six bridges collapsed 
during the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, according to a priority list prepared 
by Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of bridges on most of the major arteries have been added to the list of 
seismically vulnerable structures, including 61 on the Golden State Freeway, 31 
on the Santa Monica Freeway, 20 on the Antelope Valley Freeway and 25 on the 
Long Beach Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans Director James van Loben Sels said the assessment released Thursday 
represented a new catalogue of highway structures that engineers believe could 
be damaged in an earthquake. But he said that did not mean any overpasses were 
generally unsafe or "in danger of imminent collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, he said the retrofitting would be done on an accelerated schedule 
that he hoped would allow all the seismic strengthening to be completed by 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
 "Retrofitting works," he said. "We had graphic evidence in the Northridge 
quake that our retrofit program is performing as intended. All 114 retrofitted 
bridges in Los Angeles came through the temblor in fine shape." 
</P>
<P>
 The new report, issued after Caltrans completed a screening of 1,655 bridges, 
was a significant departure from a March prediction that only 1,000 more 
highway structures would need retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 The repair work called for in Thursday's Caltrans report represents the second 
phase of a two-stage seismic retrofitting program that was begun after the 1971 
Sylmar earthquake but did not get fully under way until highway bridge 
collapses in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake killed 43 people. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times report after the Northridge earthquake showed that even four years 
after Loma Prieta, the program was moving slowly and more than 80% of the 
bridges included in the first phase of retrofitting had not been strengthened. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, Gov. Pete Wilson ordered that the program be accelerated 
and that retrofitting get first priority on transportation funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans uses a variety of techniques for strengthening bridges, including the 
placement of steel casings around columns, enlargement of footings and the use 
of steel hinge restrainers that tie bridge decks to their supports. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Loben Sels acknowledged that the number of bridges slated for retrofitting 
in the second phase was higher than expected but he said it was because 
engineers had been scrupulously cautious in their examinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans was criticized after the Northridge earthquake because one of the 
bridges that collapsed during the temblor -- a Simi Valley Freeway overpass -- 
had not been included on the retrofitting list for the first phase of the 
program. Overruling two subordinates, engineers had decided that it could 
withstand earthquake forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the new retrofit list included more bridges than expected, Van Loben 
Sels insisted that the second phase of seismic strengthening would not deepen a 
financial crisis in the transportation program. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it would cost about $1.05 billion to complete that phase, which was 
almost exactly the amount that officials had been estimating. He said officials 
discovered after examining each bridge that in most cases the retrofitting work 
that was required was generally less extensive than had been anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a revenue shortage in the transportation program, other road and 
rail projects will have to be postponed in order to pay for the second phase of 
the retrofitting program. A $2-billion bond issue, which would have paid most 
of the costs, was defeated by voters in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement brought criticism from legislative transportation leaders who 
still questioned the Wilson Administration's commitment to the retrofitting 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), whose legislative district encompasses 
the area most heavily damaged in the Northridge quake, said the program ought 
to be completed much sooner than 1997. "If earthquake retrofit is going to be 
their No. 1 priority, they have to stop all other projects except that," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature is expected to pass a bill authored by Katz that would require 
all road projects except safety projects to be halted until the retrofitting 
program is completed. Wilson is expected to veto the measure. Caltrans 
officials have said that retrofit and road projects can be completed 
simultaneously without slowing down the seismic program. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Loben Sels said it would be impossible to complete the entire program 
before 1997 because Caltrans will have to obtain environmental permits before 
it can retrofit many of the bridges included in the new list. He said some of 
the bridges on the new list spanned wild and scenic rivers and others were in 
coastal areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those bridges on the coast along Highway 1, he said, were also 
historic bridges, meaning that retrofitting had to be done in a way that would 
not change their architectural design.

STATE BUDGET DEADLOCKED DESPITE TALKS; FINANCES: ROUND-THE-CLOCK SESSIONS WITH 
GOVERNOR AND LAWMAKERS FAIL TO IRON OUT DIFFERENCES OVER SPENDING PLAN. 
FINANCIAL SYNDICATE HEADED BY BANK OF AMERICA COULD OFFER TO EXTEND LINE OF 
CREDIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The state began the new fiscal year today without a budget after Gov. Pete 
Wilson and legislative leaders failed to resolve their differences Thursday in 
an all-day negotiating session that focused on taxes, welfare and prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and Democratic and Republican leaders of the Assembly and Senate met 
into the night in hopes of producing a spending plan and related legislation 
that could be put to a vote today. 
</P>
<P>
 The five leaders conferred early Thursday with a representative of Bank of 
America, which is heading a syndicate of financial institutions that is 
prepared to back the state's credit as it seeks billions in loans to finance 
government operations over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Taddey, managing director of BankAmerica Securities Inc., warned the 
leaders that delay in passing the budget "seriously endangers" the bank's 
ability to help the state finance its debt on the best available terms. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to legislative leaders, Taddey said the state should do all it can 
to avoid the use of IOUs, which state Controller Gray Davis said would be 
necessary as soon as Tuesday if no budget is in place. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of IOUs, officially known as registered warrants, would "further 
jeopardize the state's ongoing access to credit markets at a reasonable cost," 
Taddey wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Taddey has been advising lawmakers and the state's fiscal officers about a 
measure that would trigger spending reductions or higher taxes in the event the 
state's fiscal condition deteriorates after a budget is enacted. 
</P>
<P>
 The extraordinary legislation is necessary because Wilson's budget plan 
depends on a record $7 billion in borrowing. Wall Street investors who would 
finance the debt by buying state bonds want assurances that California will be 
able to redeem the notes even if a huge federal bailout Wilson is hoping for 
does not materialize. 
</P>
<P>
 One lawmaker said he found it troubling that an international syndicate of 
banks could be represented at the bargaining table, dictating terms to the 
state's top elected officials behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have crossed the line," said state Sen. Tom Hayden, the Santa Monica 
Democrat. "This is the way the International Monetary Fund treats Brazil." 
</P>
<P>
 But Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) said the roles 
of the banks were no more intrusive than would be expected in any relationship 
between a debtor and its creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 "A borrower is always at the mercy of the lender," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he was hopeful that the legislative leaders could agree on the 
budget in time for a vote today. The Senate passed a $57.3-billion spending 
plan Wednesday, but it was blocked by Republicans in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican lawmakers, acting in concert with Wilson, demanded deeper cuts in 
welfare than the 2.3% reduction Democrats already have accepted. The 
Republicans also want a bigger boost for state prisons than the 7.5% increase 
Democrats have agreed to. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also has demanded restoration of several executive branch positions and 
programs that Democrats deleted from the budget. Among them: the governor's 
Office of Planning and Research, which Democrats charge is used to produce 
material to aid Wilson's reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Wilson and his Republican allies are trying to protect a tax cut for 
the state's wealthiest residents that is due to take effect in 1996. 
Individuals earning more than $100,000 and couples earning twice that amount 
have been paying a surcharge on their income taxes since 1991, and Democrats 
want it extended beyond a scheduled expiration at the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who until Thursday played no direct role in negotiations with the 
lawmakers, was closeted in his office all day and was not available to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders emerged periodically to attend to legislative business but 
declined to discuss the specifics of the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just going through it," Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer 
(D-Hayward) said during one break. "It's very tedious and very detailed."

SENATE PANEL VOTES 4-0 FOR EXPULSION OF HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM and MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Senate's governing committee voted Thursday to expel veteran Sen. 
Frank Hill, a Whittier Republican who has refused to leave office despite his 
conviction on three felony charges two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation of the Rules Committee went to the full Senate, where a 
final vote is expected next week. The action came as public pressure mounted 
for lawmakers to deal as toughly with Hill as they do when passing bills that 
crack down on street criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who would become the first senator expelled since 1905, when four 
members were thrown out in the wake of a criminal scandal, did not attend the 
brief hearing and was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 A 40-year-old married father of three, Hill was found guilty June 16 by a 
federal court jury of extortion, money-laundering and conspiracy stemming from 
his acceptance in 1988 of a $2,500 payment from an undercover FBI agent seeking 
a legislative favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael), chairman of the Ethics Committee, urged 
Rules Committee members to put aside their personal affection for Hill and to 
vote to oust him as the ethically and morally correct course of action. Greene 
said he found the task of ousting "an honored and valued" colleague 
distasteful. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee voted 4 to 0 to recommend Hill's ouster to the full Senate. 
Committee member Sen. Nicholas C. Petris (D-Oakland) abstained from voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Petris, an attorney, said Hill should be allowed to remain in office at least 
until Sept. 12, when he is scheduled to be sentenced and a federal judge will 
rule on Hill's bid to set aside the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally don't feel you've had your day in court until the conclusion of 
proceedings," Petris told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene acknowledged that there were valid legal arguments in Hill's favor but 
asserted that from a "moral and ethical" standpoint, "I see no choice but to 
recommend to you that Sen. Hill be expelled." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the Rules Committee faced a similar issue was in 1990 when Sen. 
Joseph B. Montoya was convicted of felony corruption charges. The committee 
stripped him of his committee chairmanships. He left within a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill was stripped of his committee assignments shortly after the verdicts were 
returned. But because he is highly popular, senators were reluctant to force 
his ouster. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Hill last week filed a letter of resignation, but he refused to 
leave until he is sentenced. Meantime, he has continued to collect his 
$52,500-a-year salary and tax-free expense allowance. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide elected officials convicted of felonies must leave office when they 
are sentenced. However, no such requirement applies to state legislators. The 
state Constitution empowers each house to determine the suitability of its 
members, who can be expelled only by a two-thirds vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate GOP Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno, who had talked with Hill, said Hill 
told him in advance of the Rules Committee vote that he would resign before 
Sept. 12 rather than subject his colleagues to an expulsion fight in the full 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to come up on the floor," Maddy said. "Frank is going to 
resign." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Ruben Ayala (D-Chino), a member of the Rules Committee, said senators 
were under heavy constituent and newspaper editorial pressure to oust Hill. He 
said voters have accused senators of "coddling one of your own. As far as they 
are concerned, Hill is a convicted felon. Why keep him on the payroll?"

HEARING JUDGE DESCRIBED AS STRONG-WILLED, EVENHANDED; PROFILE: KATHLEEN 
KENNEDY-POWELL WILL DISMISS CHARGES WHEN SHE THINKS EVIDENCE HAS BEEN SEIZED 
IMPROPERLY, OBSERVERS SAY. 'SHE'S NOT SLANTED TOWARD THE PROSECUTION OR 
DEFENSE,' ONE VETERAN ATTORNEY SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kathleen Kennedy-Powell, the Los Angeles Municipal Court judge who will rule 
whether O.J. Simpson must stand trial in the gruesome stabbing deaths of his 
ex-wife and her friend, is a former prosecutor with a reputation as a 
strong-willed, independent jurist. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy-Powell, 41, who served in the district attorney's sexual assault unit 
before being appointed to the bench in 1988, does not hesitate to dismiss 
charges when she believes there is insufficient or improperly seized evidence, 
say lawyers who frequently practice in her Downtown courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 She is decisive, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I like about her is she makes the call for better or worse," said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Victor Rodriguez. "I don't always agree with her calls, but 
at least she makes the calls." 
</P>
<P>
 Lengthy, high-profile cases such as the Simpson one are not the usual 
courtroom fare for Kennedy-Powell, a Los Angeles native. She is used to hearing 
run-of-the-mill drug possession and burglary cases, frequently handling 10 or 
more preliminary hearings a day. Kennedy-Powell was thrust into the national 
spotlight when Patti Jo McKay, the Municipal Court judge who handled the 
arraignment, left for a previously scheduled vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a fine and hard-working judge," said Supervising Judge Veronica McBeth, 
who assigned Kennedy-Powell to the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy-Powell, a mother of two, is a member of a family that is to the law 
profession what the Wallendas are to trapezes. Her father, Brian J. Kennedy, is 
a longtime Los Angeles civil attorney, and she is married to Daniel Powell, a 
civil lawyer who specializes in medical malpractice cases. 
</P>
<P>
 On the bench, Kennedy-Powell exhibits a no-nonsense demeanor. That attitude is 
clear before one even enters her courtroom. On the door is a large plastic sign 
that reads: "Attention: Turn off all beepers and alarm watches!" The word all 
is underlined. 
</P>
<P>
 Some lawyers praise her approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not slanted toward the prosecution or defense -- she's neutral and 
impartial," said veteran Deputy Public Defender Tom Ahearn. "I've seen her get 
upset on occasion but usually for good reason. She snapped at me once because I 
showed up in her courtroom very late and held up a significant part of her 
calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I had it coming. What can I say?" 
</P>
<P>
 However, some lawyers fault her demeanor on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Among her most vocal critics is former Deputy Dist. Atty. Patricia McCombs, 
who led an effort to block her promotion to a Superior Court judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
 "She lets her temper and temperament get in the way of being a fair and 
unbiased person making decisions," said McCombs, who left the prosecutor's 
office last year to enter private practice. "It seemed like she was very 
unhappy . . . and irritated by everything." 
</P>
<P>
 In an auto theft case, McCombs said, Kennedy-Powell dismissed the charges 
because the prosecutor forgot to ask whether the crime took place in Los 
Angeles County. Rather than allow the case to be reopened for a moment so that 
the question could be asked, McCombs said, prosecutors were forced to free the 
defendant, refile the charges, rearrest him and call the witnesses back into 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy-Powell, who was on the bench much of Thursday conducting the first 
session of Simpson's preliminary hearing, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Off the bench, Kennedy-Powell is an avid sports fan who is described by 
associates as earnest and personable. 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime booster of the Los Angeles Dodgers, she is a former pitcher for a 
lawyers' softball team known as the Bad News Barristers. Kennedy-Powell, while 
a prosecutor in the mid-1980s, once worked for more than a month with casts on 
both arms after breaking them in a collision during a softball game. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she's perceived as stern or maybe even rigid, I would think that that 
would be from being so earnest about her work," said Superior Court Judge Ray 
Mireles, with whom she worked in the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy-Powell, who graduated magna cum laude with an economics degree from 
Loyola Marymount University in 1974, entered private practice in 1977, working 
in her father's civil and family law practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking more courtroom experience, she joined the district attorney's office 
in 1980, handling misdemeanor cases and eventually felony trials. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, when the Downtown Criminal Courts Building was the site of a 
series of high-profile prosecutions -- including the Nightstalker serial 
murders, the McMartin Pre-School case and the "Twilight Zone" trial -- two sets 
of court watchers often showed up at the proceedings. The first consisted 
mainly of elderly men, who viewed the daily sessions as if they were 
long-running, off-Broadway shows. The second was made up of lawyers seeking to 
pick up courtroom tips by watching the work of prominent criminal attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 On slow days, Kennedy-Powell, whose office was about 20 yards from that of 
Simpson prosecutor Marcia Clark, was among those in the latter category. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy-Powell was appointed to the district attorney's sexual assault unit in 
1986 and prosecuted several serial rapists, including one sentenced to more 
than 100 years in prison for kidnaping 12 schoolgirls. 
</P>
<P>
 Since being appointed to the bench by Gov. George Deukmejian, Kennedy-Powell 
has presided over few prominent cases. The one that probably drew the most 
public attention was a daylong preliminary hearing in which two men were 
ordered to stand trial in the savage beating of a Pasadena evangelist, Wallace 
Tope, who sought to stop looting at a Hollywood shopping center during the 1992 
Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the issues that she will have to decide in the Simpson case is whether 
evidence was properly seized from the former football star's estate in the 
hours after the June 12 slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle 
Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent Hollywood drug sales case, Kennedy-Powell encountered a similar 
issue. She dismissed charges against a defendant whose lawyer successfully 
argued that Los Angeles police officers should have obtained a search warrant 
before entering his apartment and finding three ounces of marijuana inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the police had no arrest or search warrant, the defendant, 
represented in Kennedy-Powell's court by Beverly Hills defense attorney Michael 
Chaney, did sign a consent form and a confession before the search was made. "I 
think she's wonderful," Chaney said Thursday. "She's everything a judge is 
supposed to be -- evenhanded, knowledgeable and restrained." 
</P>
<P>
 But Steve Galeria, a police narcotics detective who had testified in court to 
knocking in the apartment door, said Thursday that Kennedy-Powell's ruling had 
shocked him. "I think she made a mistake in this particular case," he said. 
"(But) I have nothing bad to say about her."

EARLY BIRDS GET 'HOTTEST SEATS IN TOWN'; SPECTATORS: EVEN SOME WHO ARRIVED 
BEFORE SUNRISE WERE TURNED AWAY FOR THE 10 COVETED SPOTS SET ASIDE FOR THE 
PUBLIC INSIDE THE COURTROOM. 'THIS IS THE CASE OF ALL CASES,' SAYS ONE COURT 
WATCHER.

<P>
 The line started behind Max Troccoli and his buddy Edward Lozano, who spent 
the night dozing in beach chairs in front of the locked doors of the Los 
Angeles County Criminal Courts Building. 
</P>
<P>
 They are veterans when it comes to camping out for big events. They slept on a 
sidewalk to get tickets to a U2 concert. Same thing for Pink Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
 So Troccoli and Lozano, ages 23 and 24, thought nothing of braving the cool 
night air to witness the most celebrated preliminary hearing ever. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, they were first in line for the hardest-to-get seats in town. 
Only 10 members of the public were allowed into the courtroom to watch the case 
against O.J. Simpson unfold. More than 50 people -- many who arrived just 
before sunrise -- were turned away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed the Menendez trial and I couldn't miss this one," said Troccoli, a 
Hollywood cable television installer who arrived at 12:30 a.m. "Someone of O.J. 
Simpson's caliber accused of double murder? Nothing compares to this." 
</P>
<P>
 Every high-profile trial, especially a murder case, attracts its share of 
looky-loos -- the curious and faithful who descend on the courthouse early in 
the morning with blankets in hand to claim a limited number of public seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule of thumb during the federal trial of the police officers who beat 
Rodney G. King was to show up by dawn for a guaranteed spot among the 
spectators. The same went for the trial of the men accused in the beating of 
Reginald O. Denny. But Ana Hernandez, 69, learned the hard way that in the O.J. 
Simpson case none of the old rules apply. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to get to the Rodney King trial at 5:30 a.m. for a seat," said 
Hernandez, who was 23rd in line when she arrived at her usual time. "This is 
something else." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, four of the 10 people granted seats had arrived by 1 a.m., and the 
rest were there by 4 a.m. A few were self-proclaimed court watchers, while 
several others were die-hard Simpson fans. All said they wanted to hear for 
themselves what evidence the prosecution had collected against the former 
football star. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe he is innocent," said Latasha Taylor, 19, standing eighth in line 
and clutching a scrapbook of newspaper and magazine photos of Simpson. "I guess 
you could say I'm a huge fan. I think he's very handsome. . . and he's a 
Cancer, like me." 
</P>
<P>
 Spectator Heidi Romeo, 30, who recently graduated from law school, was more 
interested in Simpson's high-powered team of lawyers, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really want to see the attorneys in action," said Romero, who arrived with 
her mother shortly after Troccoli and Lozano. "This is all everyone is talking 
about. If you hang around my friends, the topic is either the Bar exam or 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there were the regulars, who spent the early morning hours swapping war 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the last one to get in the courtroom when they read the verdicts in the 
Rodney King case in Simi Valley," boasted Linda Johnson, 37, of Los Angeles, 
who landed the sixth place in line on Thursday. "When the verdicts were read, I 
put my face in my hands and I wept." 
</P>
<P>
 She showed up at the Simpson hearing wearing a T-shirt that read: "Pray for 
O.J." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the biggest mystery of the century," she said. "It's like a mystery 
movie. Don't get me wrong: It's a serious matter because two people are dead. 
But I hate that O.J. is caught up in this situation, whether he is innocent or 
guilty. I'm here because I want to see him get a fair trial, one way or the 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 Her sister, Rose Brown, 46, another courtroom veteran, said: "To me, all these 
cases speak of the ills of our society. We as a people are becoming more 
violent toward each other. I'm here to pray for all involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Burns, a laid-off aerospace worker, has made court watching his hobby. 
He has won himself a seat at some of the biggies -- Denny, King, Menendez. But 
he barely made the cut Thursday, taking the last spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the case of all cases," said Burns, of Torrance. "It's the hottest 
ticket in town. Not only in town but all over the world. It's much better to 
see it in person than on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 The latecomers, however, would have to settle for just that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have sure liked to have gone in," said Jim Fair, a tourist from 
Montgomery, Ala. who showed up at the courthouse at 5 a.m, landing him the 
unlucky position of 13th in line. "I guess I'll go back to the hotel room to 
watch it on TV."

 According to Allen Wattenberg, the knife merchant who testified Thursday, a

 A German-made Stiletto

<P>
 15 inches long 
</P>
<P>
 Had a six-inch retractable blade

And he just, he liked it."

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY; IMAGE -- NOT JUST FACTS -- IS IMPORTANT ASPECT OF 
ATTORNEYS' STRATEGIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though the opening of Thursday's hearing for accused killer O.J. Simpson 
was technical and sometimes tedious, it was easy to see the way both sides are 
engaged in image-making. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Marcia Clark came across as a hard-working underdog, an underpaid 
public servant pitted against an expensive and flashy defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Underdog is the operative word from the district attorney's office. In 
private, "don't quote me" conversations away from the court, the D.A. crew says 
it's in for a difficult fight. This is the diminished-expectations spin, a 
staple of political campaign managers and football coaches who don't want the 
press to portray their side as the favorite. Victory then becomes a greater 
surprise and defeat doesn't tarnish their reputations. 
</P>
<P>
 On the defense side, Simpson attorney Robert L. Shapiro mounted a total, 
don't-give-an-inch attack on the prosecution on behalf of a client who, in 
court Thursday, looked like the O.J. Simpson of the Hertz ads, a businessman on 
the go rather than a troubled suspect on the run. 
</P>
<P>
 These images went out to a huge television audience, shaping impressions of 
the case, sparking discussions and arguments, working their way into the 
consciousness of millions, including those few Los Angeles County residents who 
will serve on the Simpson jury if he goes to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the image-making was strictly image. Simpson's appearance was an 
example of that. He was looking good in a deep blue suit, a crisp white shirt 
and a sharp but conservative red-and-blue patterned tie. It was a marked 
difference from the tieless man who appeared on Tuesday, looking like a man 
under a suicide watch, which he was. 
</P>
<P>
 I wasn't surprised at the new Simpson. Defense attorney Shapiro -- now with a 
client allowed to wear a necktie -- was able to follow his own advice. I'd just 
read an article by him, written more than a year ago, on how to groom a client 
to make a good impression on the press and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Jailed clients, he wrote, should be well-groomed and in civilian clothes. He 
explained why: "Television producers are notorious for editing in pictures of 
your client in the most unflattering light. Their preference is for pictures 
taken immediately upon arrest or transportation to court after your client has 
been up all night, unkempt and in jail clothes. They will continue to edit in 
this picture months after the fact. When this has happened, I have called 
station news directors and producers and told them my concerns. . . . Almost 
all were sensitive to my request and stopped running the negative photograph." 
</P>
<P>
 It was more than Simpson's attire. He looked alert as he watched the 
proceedings, occasionally taking notes. 
</P>
<P>
 For Simpson, the preliminary hearing is producing a new picture of him, 
replacing in news files -- and the public's mind -- those from the night of his 
arrest and earlier court appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as interesting was the clash between Shapiro and prosecutor Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark called an expert witness, Michele Kestler, the Los Angeles police crime 
lab manager, who testified about hair, blood samples and other evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Kestler fit the underpaid, public-payroll look of the prosecution side. She 
worked her way through the ranks, attending the FBI lab school, taking more 
courses, finally winning a management job. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro treated Kestler with scorn. He insisted on seeing her resume, forcing 
a recess until she walked over to police headquarters to retrieve it from her 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
 He compared her unfavorably with his expert, Dr. Henry Lee, director of the 
Connecticut State Police crime lab and a man who has investigated more than 
5,000 murders. Lee, Shapiro noted, had a 50-page curriculum vitae. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark treated Shapiro with condescension, referring to him as if he were a 
well-intentioned empty head. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, she told Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell that Shapiro needs an 
expert at his side so he'll understand what crime experts are saying. "I am 
trying to assist counsel in being more effective," she said. Shapiro, returning 
her condescension with sarcasm, said, "I certainly appreciate that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clark is doing something else worth noting. Over and over again, she has said 
the prosecution has nothing to hide, that she wants Shapiro to have all the 
evidence. Of course, the promise isn't necessary. The law gives the defense the 
right to what's in the prosecution's hands. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's part of the D.A.'s spin. The techniques of politics help explain it. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, 911 tapes were released, hinting at a domestically violent Simpson 
and hurting his image. Garcetti afterward deplored the release of the tapes, 
which police said they gave out reluctantly after news media requests. 
Nevertheless, the airing of the tapes had the impact of a negative bombshell in 
a political campaign, especially coming after a weekend of Garcetti appearances 
on national television. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in court, the D.A.'s office is turning to positive campaigning, adopting 
an image familiar to all of us who have ever read a children's book: "The 
Little Engine That Could."

SIMPSON MURDER CASE; ANOTHER SENATE PRAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Senate Chaplain Richard C. Halverson, criticized for leading the Senate 
in prayer for O.J. Simpson last week, called Thursday for God's blessing on the 
victims of domestic abuse. He also said "our nation has been traumatized by the 
fall of a great hero" and "our hearts go out to him (Simpson)."Only at the end 
did Halverson pray for "comfort and consolation to the victims and their 
families." The Debate Over Hair Samples 
</P>
<P>
 The hairs on O.J. Simpson's become a key point of contention early in the 
preliminary hearing. Prosecutors wanted 100 hairs from Simpson's head to 
compare with hairs found at the murder scene. Defense attorneys wanted to allow 
investigators only one hair. Municipal Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell 
ordered that Simpson provide at least 40 hairs. Voice 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think he did it. We'll be objective, look at the evidence and stuff 
like that. We're hoping against hope that there's no concrete evidence. We're 
hoping that he'll be let go." 
</P>

SIMPSON MURDER CASE; OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As attorneys argued inside the courtroom, Simpson's supporters and detractors 
debated furiously on the sidewalks. Some vendors hawked T-shirts that read: 
"Pray for O.J." and "Turn Loose the Juice.""I'm here to show support that he's 
innocent," said T-shirt vendor Rory Felix. He said proceeds would go toward 
Simpson's defense. Historic Hearing 
</P>
<P>
 It is unlikely the Simpson preliminary hearing will to overtake the 18-month 
record set in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case. In March, 1984, Ray 
Buckey, right, was rearrested, along with his sister, mother, grandmother and 
three other teachers. Various proceedings lasted until 1990, when a judge 
declared a mistrial, ending the longest, costliest criminal case in U.S. 
history. Voice

HOWARD ROSENBERG: TV CARNIVAL PRESENTS GAVEL-TO-GAVEL, FOLLICLE-TO-FOLLICLE 
COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even before it started, it started. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take a look at the scene here," said KCBS-TV Channel 2 reporter Dave Barker 
at 6:58 a.m. Thursday, Day 1 of a preliminary hearing to decide whether O.J. 
Simpson will be tried for the murders of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, 
and Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker was near a thick ghetto of satellite dishes outside the Downtown 
Criminal Courts Building where the proceeding was scheduled to begin in two 
hours, televised live -- gavel to gavel, follicle to follicle -- by the big 
networks and every major Los Angeles television station but one. 
</P>
<P>
 Moses parting the Red Sea wouldn't get this coverage. Another Channel 2 
reporter, Pat Lalama, would later call it "the dissemination of information 
worldwide in a technological age." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the carnival. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The sounds of the technological age hurtled across the early morning airwaves 
like aimless Scud missiles. It wasn't near 8:30, yet already on the Simpson 
vigil was KNBC-TV Channel 4 reporter Doug Kriegel: "We have just been told that 
O.J. Simpson will emerge from that building in. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Channel 4 chopper's overhead shot. "He was just put in the van," said 
anchor Chuck Henry, "and he's wearing. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Back to Kriegel, who sighted the white-and-black jail van carrying Simpson 
passing "our position." The van turned left. "The van is obeying all the 
traffic signals," Henry reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The van took another left. "How far are they from the courthouse?" Henry 
asked. "Oh, a block and a half," replied chopper reporter Bob Pettee. "About a 
block now," anchor Colleen Williams added. "And the van disappears into the 
court building," said Henry. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight hours later, the Downtown chopper activity would resume, as stations 
covered the equally incredible story of the van returning Simpson to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, America, you asked for it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The media are already attaching Roman numerals to each day of this preliminary 
hearing as if it were the Super Bowl. And come to think of it, the Super Bowl 
is the appropriate metaphor, with the nation and even the world tuned in, and 
apparently not knowing exactly why. 
</P>
<P>
 Are Inquiring Minds being manipulated? The astonishing interest in the 
Simpson-Goldman case does appear to affirm the media's role as an agenda 
setter, not so much telling Americans what to think as what to think about . In 
this case, it's O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the fascination continues remains to be seen. Yet national ratings for 
last week incisively rebut arguments that some of the media are overestimating 
public interest in this relentlessly covered case. According to the A.C. 
Nielsen Co., eight prime-time news series that prominently featured the case or 
related stories gained substantially over their audience averages for recent 
weeks. Tops was ABC's "Turning Point," increasing its audience 50% with an 
additional 6 million households. 
</P>
<P>
 Even beyond the lure of the lurid, the case offers something for nearly 
everyone, whether it's blacks who believe that Simpson is in jail because of 
his skin color or the poor and unempowered who see in his high-priced defense 
team a metaphor for a justice system that favors the rich. And for those who 
believe in the fundamental lunacy of the media, Simpson-Goldman works for them, 
too. That particularly applies to CNN, which has fed on this story like 
grunting hogs at a trough, noses into the slop, gratuitously putting on nightly 
specials and nightly audience call-ins: "Tell us how you would cover the 
story?" CNN asked one night. As if it really cared. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, there was Channel 2's Harvey Levin at 8:45 a.m. Thursday, unfurling 
just-released documents like a victory banner, becoming the first TV reporter 
to reveal in detail why the police "suspect O.J. Simpson of committing the 
murders." 
</P>
<P>
 What his drum roll led to, however, was not the expected preliminary hearing. 
In effect, it was an extension of an earlier evidentiary hearing on relatively 
technical forensic matters, a tedious exercise affirming that most legal 
proceedings, far from being exciting, are like high-rise elevators that stop at 
every floor. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until the actual preliminary hearing got going late in the afternoon 
that viewers got a taste of just how mesmerizing testimony in a sensational 
criminal case can be. All attention was on cutlery store co-owner Allen 
Wattenberg and his employee, Jose Camacho, who said that Simpson had purchased 
a knife from them May 3. The two also revealed that they had sold their stories 
to the National Enquirer, and Camacho complained about being pressured by the 
"tricky" media. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, local television turned every courtroom break into a burlesque 
wake-up call, polluting the airwaves ("Just to recap here," Channel 4's 
Williams began at one point, uttering the four words that make your heart stop) 
as well as the skies. 
</P>
<P>
 What's this? Police activity at a vacant lot in Brentwood, reportedly midway 
between Simpson's estate and the townhouse where Nicole Simpson and Goldman 
were murdered? Quick, men, to the choppers. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't know what they were covering, but they did know it was essential 
to cover it live. From the choppers, we could see not only police combing the 
vacant lot, apparently for evidence, but also some chalk circles they had drawn 
on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Quick, to the ground. "It's believed investigators have found bloodstains on 
the street here, Channel 2 reporter Marianne Kushi reported. But KYYV-TV 
Channel 11 reporter Rod Bernsen noted that the stains were brown, and only 
tests would determine if they were from blood. Bending over the chalk circles 
and pointing to dark spots, Channel 4's Kent Shocknek couldn't say at first 
"which of these marks are newer than others." Then . . . a flash. "This does 
appear to be fresher." 
</P>
<P>
 Fresher than much of the coverage, at least.

RELIGION; ISRAEL'S ENFANT TERRIBLE CALLS FOR NATION TO TAKE LEAD ROLE AMONG 
WORLD JEWRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Heresy it may have seemed, but Israel's deputy foreign minister was serious in 
his suggestion that world Jewry now needs Israel far more than the Jewish state 
needs the Diaspora that has supported it so loyally for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 Yossi Beilin, who relishes his role as the government's enfant terrible , 
daring to question the most hallowed political traditions, was not arguing that 
Israelis and the Jewish Diaspora should go their separate ways, as some 
American Jewish leaders fear is already happening. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilin rather was proposing that Israel and the Diaspora rework their complex 
relationship against the backdrop of Israel's increased political, economic and 
military strength and the threat of assimilation faced by Jewish communities 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 But the "Beilin bombshell," as the Israeli press described it, brings to the 
fore profound questions about Jewish identity, the future of Judaism and the 
character of Israel as a Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
 With its 4.2 million Jews strengthened by immigration from Russia, Israel has 
become "the one center of the Jewish people," Beilin told a gathering here of 
top Jewish leaders from around the world. He was clearly implying that even the 
5.5 million American Jews should look to Jerusalem for direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beilin sees Israel as the big brother, the patron, the tutor, the protector, 
the savior of all Jews," said an American Jewish leader attending a meeting of 
the Zionist General Assembly here this week. "He sees Israel as the stronger 
partner now, and he wants a reversal of roles." 
</P>
<P>
 David Kahn, the new president of the American Jewish Congress, was even more 
shocked this week when, speaking to legal officers in the Israeli armed forces, 
he was bluntly told that Israelis see themselves primarily as Israelis and do 
not feel they have much in common with American Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have we diverged that much?" Kahn said later. "Israelis seem to be telling 
us, 'Look to your own problems, and we will look to ours.' I am not sure what 
our relationship will be in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The essence of Beilin's plan is for Israel to repay the support it has 
received from the Diaspora by serving as the focus of Jewish identity, saving 
Jews from assimilation. A key program would bring to Israel on educational 
visits of a month or more as many as two-thirds of the 80,000 Jewish teen-agers 
who turn 17 each year around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilin urged the dissolution of two venerable institutions, the World Zionist 
Organization and the Jewish Agency, which have marshaled support for Israel and 
brought it immigrants since long before the state was established. 
</P>
<P>
 He underscored the serious nature of the changes he is proposing with the 
declaration that world Jewry should halt its fund-raising for Israel -- and 
should stop using Israel to raise funds for its own needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (is) impossible to continue to base Israel-Diaspora relations primarily on 
charity," Beilin said. "Neither can we any longer base fund-raising appeals by 
the central communal institutions in the Diaspora on the imminent, perhaps 
mortal threat to Israel's security or economic or social viability, which have 
been the primary emotional bases of those appeals." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilin proposed a new organization, Beit Yisrael (House of Israel), to shape 
the dialogue, assume responsibility for Jewish education in the Diaspora and 
support immigration to Israel. And Israel Bonds, another venerable institution, 
should be converted into "a worldwide mutual fund for entrepreneurial 
investment" in Israel, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction has been furious. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin disowned Beilin, saying his proposal was not 
government thinking, that the Jewish Agency might need "a new agenda" but 
should remain intact and that Israel certainly needed continued assistance from 
the Diaspora. 
</P>
<P>
 Yehiel Leket, acting chairman of the Jewish Agency, accused Beilin of 
endangering the $3 billion Israel receives in military and economic assistance 
from the United States each year and the $500 million that American Jews raise 
for it annually.

ECONOMICS; PAKISTANIS BITE BACK AT NEW TAXES; BHUTTO SLAPS LEVIES ON SCORES OF 
CONSUMER GOODS TO TRIM DEFICIT. PREMIER'S MOVE IS MET WITH HOWLS AND STRIKES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Urdu word for taxes ( mehsool ) probably sounds no sweeter to the 
Pakistani ear than "1040" does to Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 But Benazir Bhutto, prime minister of a country where only an estimated 1% of 
the population pays taxes, has imposed heftier levies to trim the fiscal 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices on scores of domestically produced consumer items and imports -- from a 
small cup of ice cream (now 21 cents) to a computer ($1,800) -- have zoomed 
upward by 20% in consequence. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, over howls of protest and a 48-hour strike launched by business 
leaders, the National Assembly approved Bhutto's new taxes as part of her 
8-month-old government's 1994-95 annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime minister had promised a "tough budget," and many Pakistanis believe 
she delivered. Attention focused on a general sales tax of 15% that now has 
been extended to cover more than 270 consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no Aladdin's lamp to change economic conditions overnight," Bhutto 
said in a televised address. "We will have to sacrifice this year to reduce the 
budget deficit." 
</P>
<P>
 The general sales tax is supposed to raise $500 million in revenue for a 
government that runs chronically in the red. Other new levies totaling $400 
million are also programmed into the $12.8-billion spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Western diplomats and economists were impressed by Bhutto's gutsy willingness 
to risk short-term political pain in return for cutting the fiscal deficit to a 
projected 4% of gross domestic product and transforming the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first real step to trade liberalization and the first real step 
to tax reform," an international economist in Islamabad said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new budget, tariffs have been cut, import license fees removed and 
export taxes lifted. Starting today, the rupee will be virtually convertible. 
</P>
<P>
 The domestic reception was more mixed. Opposition leader Nawaz Sharif said his 
party would not be an accomplice to the ruin of the Pakistani economy. Business 
leaders complained the new taxes will hobble leading industries such as 
textiles and construction. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of the week, shops were shuttered, factories halted 
production and coal mines stopped work in response to a two-day strike call 
from the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Lahore economist and businessman Akhmal Hussain, whose family enterprise makes 
ballpoint pens, doubts that Bhutto and her Pakistan People's Party will get the 
results they hope for. "I think she's a brave lady, but she needs a good 
economist to advise her. This particular budget is likely to increase inflation 
and decrease economic growth." 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation in Pakistan is already running at an official 10.8%, while growth is 
only 4%, lackluster for an Asian economy. The government is projecting 7% 
economic expansion next year, but many doubt that will happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the business community's protests, Bhutto's government dropped its 
plan to allow tax collectors to arrest tax evaders. But it is still counting on 
tougher tax enforcement and heightened compliance to help fill government 
coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 By one economist's estimate, no less than a third of projected new revenue 
would come from legal imports (smuggling is expected to decline) and from 
tougher application of tax laws. It remains to be seen whether that gamble will 
pay off in a country where mehsool is almost a dirty word and tax cheats are 
rarely, if ever, prosecuted.

NEW JAPANESE PREMIER NOT EXACTLY GROOMED FOR TOP JOB; POLITICS: LITTLE STANDS 
OUT ABOUT MURAYAMA -- EXCEPT HIS EYEBROWS. THE MODEST LEADER IS NOT KNOWN FOR 
HIS POLICIES OR AMBITION, BUT IS PRAISED AS A GENIAL MAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When people here talk about Tomiichi Murayama, the Socialist Party chairman 
who stunned the world by winning election Wednesday as Japan's new prime 
minister, it is not his political philosophy nor his leadership style that 
invariably merits a mention. 
</P>
<P>
 It is his enormous, shaggy eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
 That facial hair is Murayama's single most distinctive characteristic pretty 
much says it all about this modest, amiable fisherman's son who never dreamed 
of becoming Japan's top political leader and has repeatedly said he is 
unqualified for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 On that point, few argue otherwise. Murayama, 70, has never held a Cabinet 
post in 39 years of political life. He has never traveled widely in Asia or the 
United States, his staff says. At a time when the world is pressing Japan to 
reduce its trade surplus, open its markets and take a greater role in global 
affairs, Murayama's specialty is domestic welfare issues; his most prominent 
book to date is titled "Your Pension." 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people say he has no leadership and no knowledge about policy, and that 
is true," said a Japanese journalist who has covered Murayama for the past two 
years. "And if a crucial moment occurs on economic or security matters, it is 
hopeless that Mr. Murayama can do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama is essentially another titular head of another shaky political 
coalition -- this time a shotgun marriage between erstwhile rivals, the liberal 
Socialists and the conservative Liberal Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts believe his administration will collapse in a matter of months 
and will be remembered merely as another stage in the recasting of Japan's 
political landscape that began last year with the demise of the Liberal 
Democratic Party's 38-year rule. "This is just another part of the power game; 
it will last for another one or two years," the journalist said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama is a left-leaning Socialist, whose party has supported North Korea, 
opposed opening Japan's agricultural markets, criticized nuclear energy and 
objected to the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet those policies are not likely to become the law of the land. The new 
ruling coalition has already announced that it will maintain previous 
government policies; few analysts think coalition leaders would dare renege on 
political reform or Japan's commitment to open its markets under the so-called 
Uruguay Round accord. Legislation on both issues will be made final later this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the Socialists' traditional distance from the United States, a 
party spokesman said that Murayama "has a lot to learn about international 
politics" and would basically leave foreign policy to the LDP. "The LDP has 
good connections to the U.S. and other countries, so on diplomatic policies, I 
suppose there will be no problem," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some argue it doesn't particularly matter who becomes prime minister in Japan 
because national policy is crafted and executed not by politicians but by 
bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's new prime minister is a native of a small fishing village in Oita 
prefecture in the southern island of Kyushu. Born March 3, 1924, he is the 
seventh of 11 children. He devoted himself to the labor movement after watching 
his mother struggle in poverty peddling fish after her husband died while 
Murayama was a junior high school student, according to Japanese press reports. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of a two-year program in politics and economics at Meiji 
University, Murayama has devoted his entire career to being a Socialist Party 
politician. He worked his way up from city councilman in 1955 to prefectural 
assemblyman in 1963 to the lower house of Parliament in 1972, where he is now 
serving his seventh term. 
</P>
<P>
 He was in the army in World War II but quickly joined the postwar democracy 
movement. He says the most moving moment of his life came shortly after the 
war, when he listened to a fiery speech by a writer, Hitoshi Yamakawa, who 
declared Japan was poised on the doorstep of great change toward becoming a 
democratic nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Murayama has been an avid opponent of moves to strengthen Japan's 
military. He engineered the famous "cow walk" tactic a few years ago -- in 
which opposition party members took an interminable time walking to the ballot 
box to try to block passage of a bill to dispatch Japanese Self-Defense Forces 
overseas to aid in U.N. peacekeeping activities. The maneuver failed, however. 
</P>
<P>
 He is most favorably known for his geniality and ability to bring people 
together across party lines. He honed that skill as the Socialist chairman of 
the parliamentary affairs committee from 1991, working closely with his LDP 
counterpart.  
</P>
<P>
 Murayama is also strikingly unambitious, a quality that has kept him from 
making enemies. He wanted to retire last July but ran again when his supporters 
begged him to. When he was tapped to become Socialist chairman last year, he 
said he had neither the desire nor ability for the job. And when he was 
approached to run for prime minister as the candidate of the LDP-Socialist-New 
Party Harbinger alliance, he was so shocked he asked, "What country are you 
talking about?" 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the glamorous Morihiro Hosokawa -- who donned Armani ties, 
sported hair implants and carefully managed his media image as the first 
coalition government's prime minister -- Murayama is resolutely anti-chic. When 
asked why he doesn't trim his bushy eyebrows, he told reporters: "I don't care 
about my appearance. Natural is best." 
</P>
<P>
 He told one Japanese journalist he did not want to move into the prime 
minister's residence because he would no longer be able to cook for himself or 
wash his own socks. He performs such pedestrian chores while living alone in 
the small, two-bedroom apartment provided to Parliament members. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the traditional role of the Japanese political spouse, 
Murayama's wife, Yoshie, 71, stays behind in his Oita district. The couple has 
two daughters; Murayama says his life's greatest pleasure is playing with his 
two grandchildren. He is often called the "good grandpa" in press reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama's resume lists reading and theater as his hobbies. But when queried, 
a staff member responded: "Well, he doesn't really have any hobbies." But he 
has a motto: "Always remain with the people and learn from them." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other prime ministers, Murayama will almost certainly not be hounded 
from office over corruption charges. He lists no stock, no debt and total 
assets of $336,000. Profile: Tomiichi Murayama 
</P>
<P>
 Title: Prime minister of Japan

<P>
 Born: March 3, 1924, in Oita prefecture on Kyushu island.

</P>
<P>

SEEMINGLY INCONCEIVABLE SCENARIOS BECOME REALITY IN TOPSY-TURVY JAPAN; 
POLITICS: THREE POTENTIAL PRIME MINISTERS ARE NAMED TO KEY POSTS IN NEW CABINET 
HEADED BY SOCIALIST CHAIRMAN TOMIICHI MURAYAMA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What's this? A party at the helm of Japan controlling only 14% of the seats in 
the lower house of Parliament? Radical left-wingers supporting a coalition with 
the old conservative stalwarts? Or, most unlikely of all, a Cabinet in which 
three potential prime ministers hold down the most important posts under a 
Socialist? 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, all three of those seemingly inconceivable scenarios became a 
reality in the topsy-turvy world of politics in Japan, which just a year ago 
was so stable that critics questioned if it really was a democracy. After all, 
what other democratic country had not experienced a change of government in 38 
years? 
</P>
<P>
 Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's new prime minister, served up 
the latest strange twists on Thursday when he named his Cabinet: 
</P>
<P>
 * Yohei Kono -- who offered the nation's top post to Murayama instead of 
seeking it himself as head of the largest party, the Liberal Democrats -- was 
named foreign minister, with an additional title as deputy prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 * Masayoshi Takemura, the leader of the New Party Harbinger who is viewed as a 
possible compromise prime minister in the future, became finance minister. 
</P>
<P>
 * And Ryutaro Hashimoto, a Liberal Democrat who voluntarily bowed to Kono last 
August when the LDP chose a new leader, was named minister of international 
trade and industry. 
</P>
<P>
 All three men differ from their back-bench predecessors in bringing both 
personal power and a reputation for making their own decisions to their posts. 
They also have vowed to end the rubber-stamping of decisions made by 
bureaucrats that pervaded the "reform" coalition administrations of Morihiro 
Hosokawa and Tsutomu Hata. 
</P>
<P>
 Takemura, for one, on Wednesday overturned a Hata Cabinet acceptance of a 
Finance Ministry proposal that would have turned a plan to cut income taxes to 
spur the economy into a program for a net tax increase in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than fly off the bat into a decision fixing increases in the (3%) 
consumption tax, first we have to study how much costs can be cut by reforming 
the government's administration, just like private enterprises are doing as 
they carry out restructuring," he said. "After that, we can figure out how much 
more revenue is needed" to replace the shortfall from income-tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 He also refused to set any deadline for a decision, defying the 
budget-balancing-obsessed Finance Ministry. The ministry wants legislation by 
the year's end to impose a consumption tax increase three years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Murayama noted that he had been chosen in "uncommon fashion" and said 
he wants to implement "uncommon politics," his Cabinet -- except for the 
appointments of the three bigwigs -- was not uncommon. Seats were apportioned 
by seniority and factional affiliation in line with the strengths of the 
coalition -- 13 to the Liberal Democrats, five to the Socialists and two to the 
New Party Harbinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one woman, Makiko Tanaka, the outspoken daughter of the late Prime 
Minister Kakuei Tanaka, was appointed. She became minister of science and 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Man-in-the-street interviews aired on television showed apprehension about a 
government headed by a party once noted for its "opposition for opposition's 
sake" approach to politics. Many predicted that Murayama, like his six 
predecessors in the last five years, would not last long. "Do something to 
improve the economy" was the most widespread request made of the new 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence of the "odd-triangle" Cabinet itself underscored the upheaval 
that has altered the old assumptions of Japanese politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's own miniature version of the Cold War -- the Liberal Democrats on 
America's side, the Socialists often on communism's side -- ended when the 
United States and Russia shook hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their official advocacy of abolishing the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, 
the Socialists, for example, haven't said a word in years about getting rid of 
the alliance and the bases it provides to the United States in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Liberal Democrats, in their party charter, advocate constitutional 
revision -- which is anathema to the Socialists. Yet the LDP has done nothing 
for decades to press for revision. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, defections of about 50 legislators broke the LDP grip on 
government, wiping out the old definitions of political divisions between 
"conservatives," who ran the government, and "progressive reformists," who 
bided their time in the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, conservatives supporting Hosokawa, then Hata, suddenly 
became the "progressive reformists." The Socialists, who lost nearly half their 
seats in an election last July, were the big losers -- not the Liberal 
Democrats, who actually gained one seat compared with their post-rebellion 
holdings going into the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the old barometers of party seats in Parliament and the size of factions 
of legislators run by political bosses have become tenuous measuring sticks in 
attempts to predict the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The Socialists, for example, head the government holding only 14% of the seats 
in the lower house. Even how much support Murayama's Cabinet has in Parliament 
is unknown. On paper, parties backing him should have produced 301 votes in 
Wednesday's election. Yet Murayama polled only 261 in a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Party discipline is cracking. Rebellions remain fermenting. And more 
realignments are likely as Japan seeks a new basis on which to deal with new 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Should big government finance welfare costs for an aging population -- or 
should more self-reliance be sought? Should government, through the standards 
it sets, continue to ensure consumer product safety, or should consumers assume 
the responsibility themselves? Does Japan wish to play a greater international 
role, or remain a passive bystander in global politics? 
</P>
<P>
 More fundamentally, will Japan continue to rely upon agonizingly slow 
consensus-making (as Murayama's Cabinet appears to favor), or should votes be 
taken and majority decisions enforced (as Ichiro Ozawa, Hata's chief 
strategist, argues)? 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Japan has suddenly become a nation of coalition governments after 
knowing nothing but rule by the Liberal Democratic Party from 1955 to 1993, the 
answers, with few exceptions, can no longer be found within party structures, 
or even within party factions. In that sense, Murayama's coalition is not 
unique. 
</P>
<P>
 The Liberal Democrats and Socialists already have far more experience in 
dealing with each other than most people remember. During the long LDP rule, 
the two parties cooperated so that bills the Socialists opposed, or pretended 
to oppose, were enacted. Even scuffles and pushing matches were scripted, said 
Yasuhiro Tase, a senior political reporter for the Nihon Keizai newspaper. 
Murayama himself once served as his party's parliamentary steering committee 
chief, and won a reputation for smooth dealings with the Liberal Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a bitter Hosokawa, whom the Liberal Democrats forced to resign in 
April over charges of questionable financial dealings, condemned the new 
coalition as yet another "act of collusion" between the two groups. He 
predicted it would be their last "conspiracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama and Kono, however, asked voters to wait and see. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving home Thursday, Murayama said he would try to ease "feelings of 
uneasiness" that his election had caused "in various circles." Kono challenged 
reporters to examine the new coalition's policies "to see if we really have 
trouble reaching agreement" on what to do and watch to see "if we really are an 
'illicit union,' as critics charge."

KANTOR, CITING UNSETTLED JAPAN POLITICS, PUTS OFF TRADE RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor postponed a ruling Thursday on a 
critical U.S.-Japanese trade dispute, citing the unsettled Japanese political 
situation following the selection Wednesday of a new government. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor announced he would put off for up to 30 days a decision on allegedly 
discriminatory Japanese government procurement practices for medical products 
and telecommunications equipment. Such a decision could begin a process that 
might end with the United States imposing trade sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor also said a delay was acceptable because trade negotiators have made 
steady progress toward resolving the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay marked the first tangible fallout from a government shuffle that is 
expected to sharply slow the progress of U.S.-Japanese trade talks and greatly 
reduce the chances that any important bilateral decisions are reached at next 
week's meeting of top industrial nations in Naples, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has heavily stressed those trade efforts, and 
officials had hoped to produce visible results before the summit began. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Kantor said the United States would immediately begin an 
investigation of allegations that the Chinese have not properly protected U.S. 
patents and copyrights in their country. The announcement means China could 
face sanctions if the two countries do not resolve the disagreement in the next 
few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor has said that he would not allow instability in Japan -- now on its 
fourth government in a year -- to put off trade actions. But, he said, "I am a 
realist. I understand what the situation is, and the possibilities of whether 
or not we are going to reach a conclusion that is satisfactory to the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
 The new coalition government, led by Tomiichi Murayama, is considered highly 
unstable. Many analysts in Japan and elsewhere predict it may dissolve quickly. 
Even so, U.S. officials publicly asserted that they intend to try to forge 
ahead on the outstanding U.S.-Japanese issues at the Naples summit with a 
meeting between Clinton and Murayama. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Lake, Clinton's national security adviser, said the meeting "obviously 
will be a get-acquainted session. But I would expect . . . that there will be 
discussion of important bilateral issues." The topics will include the broad 
framework of U.S.-Japanese trade and "a very serious discussion of North 
Korea."

HAITI MILITARY HURT BY SANCTIONS, OFFICIALS SAY; CARIBBEAN: CHRISTOPHER CLAIMS

 Senior Clinton Administration officials said Thursday that they are seeing 
encouraging signs that economic sanctions are putting so much strain on Haiti's 
military regime that a U.S. invasion may not be needed to restore the elected 
president to power there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're now getting some traction" from sanctions, Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they will ultimately be out because of the pressure we've brought," 
he said, referring to Haiti's military rulers. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether the Administration favored an invasion to overthrow the regime 
and reinstall exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Christopher said: "No . 
. . the option we're pursuing now is to try to increase the pressure through 
the use of sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
 He said many of the sanctions were "relatively recent," and he argued that 
they should be given time to work before military options are considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's comments echoed a statement a day earlier by Defense Secretary 
William J. Perry, who has publicly expressed opposition to an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Another senior official said U.S. intelligence analysts have detected 
increasing signs of strains in Haiti's ruling elite, including apparent 
conflict between Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the military chief of staff, and other 
leaders of the regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot going on in Port-au-Prince that we can't talk about in detail," 
one official said. "Each individual is feeling pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 The officials spoke after White House meetings on Monday held to review the 
Administration's sanctions policy, as well as its efforts to provide facilities 
for thousands of refugees who have sailed from Haiti during the last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Wednesday, police reportedly fired on a 60-foot boat carrying would-be 
refugees off the southern coast village of Nan L'Etat, causing a panic in which 
30 to 40 refugees drowned. 
</P>
<P>
 The report came Thursday from two Western journalists, who quoted witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard said it picked up at least 700 more refugees from the waters 
off Haiti on Thursday, bringing the total number rescued over the last six days 
to more than 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one day after President Clinton announced the reopening of a tent city 
for refugees at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, 1,123 Haitians were 
being housed there, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The flood of refugees appeared to increase pressure on the Administration for 
a solution to the Haitian impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials insisted that, at least for now, Clinton is not being pushed 
toward a decision to invade. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Republican senators warned Christopher that they will fiercely oppose 
any military intervention in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe that there is any vital national interest or strategic reason 
for the United States to risk even one life of one American service person to 
restore Aristide to power," Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) said. "If we do invade, 
and that first body bag comes out, that's when all hell is going to break 
loose." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our interests in Haiti are very strong ones," he said. "It is in our own back 
yard. Stability in the Caribbean and in the region really is dependent upon not 
having elected leaders overthrown by an illegitimate group of thugs." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday evening, the Senate rejected, 65 to 34, a Republican-sponsored 
measure that would have required Clinton to obtain formal authorization from 
Congress before taking any military action in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jamaica, U.S. officials working around the clock processing Haitian 
refugees on a Navy hospital ship anchored in Kingston harbor began shuttling 
the overflow to Guantanamo Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the more than 4,000 Haitians picked up, 978 have been interviewed by the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said 301 of them have been found to have "a well-founded fear of 
persecution," which is the official standard for winning refugee status, and 
are awaiting transport to the United States, Canada or other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 With a capacity of 12,500, the Guantanamo naval base is seen as an easily 
readied emergency camp to be used only until a more permanent asylum center is 
opened in the Turks and Caicos Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the current rate of exodus, refugees threaten to quickly fill both the 
Guantanamo camp and the Turks and Caicos station, which has a planned capacity 
of 2,000. It will open by July 15, officials said.

SENSE OF RELIEF FELT AT WHITE HOUSE AFTER INITIAL PHASE OF FISKE'S PROBE; 
WHITEWATER: BUT FEELING MAY BE SHORT-LIVED. HIS INQUIRY IS CONTINUING, 
CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS ARE SCHEDULED AND AN INTERNAL REVIEW IS LAUNCHED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There was relief but no jubilation in the White House at news Thursday that 
Whitewater special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. would not seek indictments in 
the Washington phase of his investigation. And even the relief is likely to be 
short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 The President, his wife and his senior staff still face a protracted 
investigation into a variety of matters in Arkansas and Washington, as well as 
congressional hearings that start July 26. Also, White House Counsel Lloyd N. 
Cutler plans a potentially damaging internal inquiry into the propriety of 
extensive contacts between the White House and federal regulators over the 
Clintons' ties to a failed savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske demonstrated in the initial phase of his investigation that he intends 
to be painstaking in his approach and that he is not likely to be driven by 
artificial deadlines. In the four-month inquiry into Washington aspects of the 
case, Fiske and his staff interrogated 188 witnesses -- most of them under oath 
before a grand jury -- and reviewed thousands of pages of subpoenaed documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The far-more-complicated series of events in Arkansas revolving around the 
Clintons' involvement in banking, real estate, investment and political 
fund-raising activities centered on the Whitewater real estate development is 
likely to occupy Fiske's attention for many more months, probably stretching to 
the middle or end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 And the special counsel signaled that he sees a political as well as legal 
dimension to his mandate. While clearing top presidential aides of criminal 
conduct Thursday, he pointedly refused to pass judgment on the propriety or 
ethics of their actions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fiske investigation eventually could absolve President Clinton and First 
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton of any criminal or civil liability in the 
Whitewater puzzle, though it also could deliver an unfavorable verdict on their 
behavior over 14 years in public life in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler welcomed as "very good news" Fiske's announcement that no one would be 
charged with obstruction of justice for interfering with a federal criminal 
investigation of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan in Arkansas. The failed thrift 
was owned by James B. McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater 
Development Corp., in which the Clintons invested and lost money. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler also expressed gratification at Fiske's conclusion that Deputy White 
House Counsel Vincent Foster had committed suicide and was not murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cutler said he would conduct his own investigation of a series of contacts 
between top White House staff members and Treasury Department officials on the 
Madison Guaranty inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler conceded that the White House-Treasury contacts were "inadvisable in 
hindsight." He said he intends to discover whether they violated government 
ethics or conflict-of-interest rules and decide whether any Administration 
officials should be disciplined or fired. 
</P>
<P>
 In line with that inquiry, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen also announced 
Thursday that his department's Office of Inspector General will conduct a 
review of the conduct of senior Treasury officials who briefed White House 
officials about the progress of the Madison Guaranty investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Former White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum already has lost his job as a 
result of his participation in the meetings. Other top Administration officials 
-- including senior White House adviser George Stephanopoulos; Margaret A. 
Williams, Mrs. Clinton's chief of staff, and Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger 
Altman -- also took part in the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler has added two lawyers to the White House counsel's office to assist in 
the inquiry: Sheila Cheston, deputy general counsel of the Air Force, and Jane 
Sherburne of Cutler's law firm, Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering. Both are on 
temporary assignment, Cutler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House counsel said he intends to complete the internal inquiry 
before hearings by House and Senate committees begin the last week in July. He 
said the Administration will cooperate fully in the congressional 
investigations and that President and Mrs. Clinton will respond to requests for 
information within "accepted precedents." 
</P>
<P>
 No President has ever appeared before a congressional investigating committee 
but former President Ronald Reagan answered questions for the Iran-Contra 
inquiry on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler suggested that the Clintons, who were interviewed in the White House 
three weeks ago by Fiske, would be willing to give written answers to questions 
from the congressional panels. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic leaders in the House and Senate agreed to the hearings on condition 
that they not interfere with Fiske's investigation by exploring areas in which 
his inquiry has not been completed. Thus the congressional hearings are 
expected to focus on the White House-Treasury contacts and on the handling of 
documents removed from Foster's office immediately after his suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, (R-N.Y.), the ranking Republican on the Senate 
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, which will conduct one of the 
hearings, said he wants a full investigation of the contacts between the White 
House and banking regulators, despite Fiske's conclusion that no laws were 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the purpose (of the contacts) was not to obstruct justice or influence an 
ongoing investigation, then what was the purpose?" D'Amato asked. "They were 
clearly improper. They shouldn't have taken place. What was discussed at them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) -- chairman of the House Banking, Finance and 
Urban Affairs Committee, which also plans hearings on the matter -- said the 
Fiske report should persuade the public that the Whitewater controversy has 
been exploited for political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fiske findings "may go a long way toward revealing how much of the 
Whitewater furor is simply partisan hysteria," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa), ranking Republican on the House Banking 
Committee, asserted that the issues covered by Thursday's reports amount to 
"less than 5%" of Fiske's investigatory mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "By far the major part of the independent counsel's mandate relates to 
taxpayer losses resulting from the failure of an Arkansas S&L and analogous 
conflict of interest problems in the state," said Leach, who has been the 
member of Congress most aggressively pursuing Whitewater-related matters. "His 
report on the larger aspects of his probe is yet to come." Excerpts From Fiske 
Report 
</P>
<P>
 Excerpts from special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr.'s statement and his first 
report on the Whitewater case. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SUICIDE: This report concludes that on July 20, 1993, Mr. Foster committed 
suicide in Ft. Marcy Park, Fairfax County, Va. The report lists a number of 
factors that may have contributed to his suicide, and finds no evidence that 
matters relating to Whitewater, Madison Guaranty or CMS played any role in his 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 PROBE'S GOAL: The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the 
evidence established that any of those contacts, viewed individually or 
collectively, amounted to a violation of law by anyone involved. A total of 
more than twenty different contacts, either face-to-face meetings or telephone 
conversations, were investigated. The investigation focused on whether in the 
course of any of these contacts, any individual obstructed justice, attempted 
to obstruct justice, or conspired with others to obstruct justice, as defined 
in Title 18, United States Code, Section 1505.  
</P>
<P>
 WHITE HOUSE: After a review of all the evidence, we have concluded that the 
evidence is insufficient to establish that anyone within the White House or the 
Department of the Treasury acted with the intent to corruptly influence an RTC 
investigation. Therefore, the evidence of the events surrounding the contacts 
between the White House and the Treasury Department does not justify the 
prosecution of anyone for a violation of Section 1505. We have also concluded 
that the evidence does not justify a criminal prosecution for violation of any 
other federal statute. 
</P>
<P>
 TRAVEL OFFICE FALLOUT: Those close to Foster have stated that the single 
greatest source of his distress was the criticism he and others within the 
counsel's office received following the firing of seven employees from the 
White House travel office.  
</P>
<P>
 NO SIGN OF DISTRESS: Each of Foster's co-workers, friends and family whom we 
questioned was explicitly asked whether Foster had ever mentioned Whitewater or 
Madison Guaranty related matters as a cause of concern or distress. According 
to each of these people, Foster had never expressed any concern about these 
matters.

N.Y. MOVES PRIMARY AHEAD OF CALIFORNIA'S

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move designed to give New York more clout in presidential politics, Gov. 
Mario M. Cuomo and legislative leaders agreed Thursday to shift the state's 
primary to early March. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision comes after California moved its primary from early June to the 
fourth Tuesday in March.That would have put California before New York's 
traditional first Tuesday in April date. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be shifting the primary to the first Tuesday in March," press 
secretary Anne Crowley said. But since a Jewish holiday falls on the first 
Tuesday in March in 1996, the primary will be held on the first Thursday that 
year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The presidential primary change is expected to be approved by both houses of 
the state Legislature.

JIM BAKKER REPORTEDLY WILL LEAVE PRISON, MOVE INTO HALFWAY HOUSE 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former television evangelist Jim Bakker will leave a federal prison today and 
move into a halfway house, the Charlotte Observer newspaper reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakker, who was convicted in 1989 of stealing millions of dollars from his 
followers, had not been expected to leave federal prison until September.He has 
served about 4 1/2 years of an eight-year sentence that was reduced from an 
original sentence of 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 He and wife Tammy Faye Bakker allegedly spent some $150 million bilked from 
members of the Praise The Lord club. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple also operated Heritage USA, a theme park in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bakkers were divorced in 1992, and Tammy Faye Bakker married builder Roe 
Messner last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Correctional Institution in Jesup, Ga., where Bakker is serving 
his sentence, refused comment on his release. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our policy is that releases or transfers of any inmate are not published 
information until after the fact," said Brian Hoyt, executive assistant to the 
warden. "Many inmates qualify for community corrections placement." 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper said Bakker, 53, would work at an Asheville, N.C., business 
during the day and return to the halfway house at night. A smooth tenure there 
would ensure his release in December.

<P>
 Carol Brown Hubbard, the wife of former Kentucky Rep. Carroll Hubbard Jr., 
said Thursday before she was sentenced to fives years of probation for aiding 
the theft of government property that she "didn't mean to do anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 She had been accused of using her husband's congressional staffers on her 
failed campaign for the House in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Louis F. Oberdorfer also sentenced Mrs. Hubbard to perform 
100 hours of community service and pay $27,000 in restitution. She pleaded 
guilty in April to one misdemeanor count of aiding and abetting theft of 
government property. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband pleaded guilty to three felony counts, but his sentencing was 
delayed until July 6 following lengthy discussions Thursday in the judge's 
chambers.

FEDERAL JUDGE, WIFE, MAID BOUND AND ROBBED 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An appeals court judge once nominated for the U.S. Supreme Court was tied up 
and robbed along with his wife and maid, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Homer Thornberry, 85, was not injured in the incident but his wife, Marian 
Thornberry, 78, was treated for three broken bones in her leg.The maid was not 
injured in the robbery Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The thief took an undetermined amount of cash and jewelry. A police spokesman 
said the Thornberrys were likely targeted because of their age, not because of 
the judge's service on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornberry, a senior judge on the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, had close 
ties to former President Lyndon B. Johnson and is a well-known figure in Texas 
politics. Johnson appointed him to the appeals court in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, Johnson nominated Thornberry to fill the Supreme Court seat held by 
Abe Fortas, whom Johnson had nominated to succeed Earl Warren as chief justice. 
Thornberry's nomination died when the Senate blocked Fortas' nomination as 
chief justice.

FRENCH RESCUE 74 TUTSIS IN NIGHTTIME RWANDA FLIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Making dangerous flights in darkness, French commandos rescued 74 ragged 
Tutsis from Rwanda late Thursday after they spent days in hiding from marauding 
Hutu militiamen. 
</P>
<P>
 The refugees had bullet and machete wounds, some many days old.They were flown 
by six helicopters to Goma, the Zairian border town that is the base for the 
U.N.-authorized French humanitarian mission in western Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Filthy children, some barely conscious and obviously unfed for days, were 
carried off in the arms of medics and gently laid on stretchers. Dazed adults, 
many with leg and head wounds, hobbled off the aircraft into ambulances. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the biggest rescue so far in France's week-old operation to save people 
from nearly three months of ethnic slaughter in Rwanda's civil war. On Tuesday, 
commandos evacuated 35 nuns and eight orphans from a convent where they were 
being menaced by Hutu extremists. 
</P>
<P>
 The rescue Thursday night was the first to involve a large number of people 
from the minority Tutsi ethnic group, whose members have been the main victims 
of massacres. Hundreds of thousands of people have been slain in Rwanda's civil 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 The refugees were among 200 Tutsis found hiding near Mt. Karoungi, about 30 
miles south of Goma in a region where French patrols have been increasing 
operations to find and aid war victims.

BANGLADESHIS CLASH OVER 'INFIDEL' WRITER; ASIA: WOMAN STILL IN HIDING AFTER 
MILITANTS ACCUSE HER OF INSULTING THE KORAN, CALL FOR HER DEATH. NEARLY 150 
PEOPLE ARE HURT IN FIGHTING DURING STRIKE.

<P>
 Thousands of Muslim fundamentalists, demanding a feminist writer be put to 
death as a blaspheming infidel, clashed with opponents and police Thursday on 
the streets of Bangladesh's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses in Dhaka were closed and the streets empty of traffic as the result 
of a half-day strike called by Islamic militants to demand Taslima Nasrin's 
execution for allegedly insulting the Koran. 
</P>
<P>
 Police used tear gas, water cannon, rifle butts and batons to repulse Muslim 
zealots, who hurled rocks and crude homemade bombs and waved bamboo clubs as 
they tried to penetrate barbed-wire barriers put up by police near a central 
mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 In half a dozen downtown areas, fundamentalists and rival political and 
student groups fought with knives and threw simple, firecracker-like explosives 
at each other. Police dispersed them with batons and tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 50 people were reportedly injured in the fighting around the mosque, 
including four police officers. Authorities said the number of people hurt rose 
to nearly 150 as fighting between rival groups spread after the Islamic 
radicals extended their strike until dusk. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kishorganj, northeast of the capital, police opened fire as thousands of 
rampaging fundamentalists reportedly tried to seize their rifles. One man was 
killed and about 10 people injured, including six police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's events highlighted the growing importance of Islamic militancy in 
poor, densely populated Bangladesh, where it is a relatively new phenomenon, as 
well as the tardiness of Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's government in coming to 
grips with the challenges it poses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major political parties in the country are wooing the fundamentalists to 
be in power, and this has put the Islamic groups in an exceptionally 
advantageous situation," Kamal Hussain, a former foreign minister, said. 
</P>
<P>
 At dawn, rival groups took to the streets, pelting each other with stones 
across police barricades and shouting abuse. About 300 people paraded through 
the streets of central Dhaka, chanting, "Death to Taslima Nasrin, the infidel!" 
A few blocks away, the same number of university students, demonstrating in the 
writer's favor, yelled insults against the "traders in religion." 
</P>
<P>
 Bangladeshi student and political groups opposed to the Muslim militants had 
called their own one-day strike to "resist the resurgence of Islamic 
fundamentalists." 
</P>
<P>
 Since June 4, when a Dhaka court ordered her arrest for offending the 
religious feelings of Bangladeshis, 90% of whom are Muslim, Nasrin has been in 
hiding. A Calcutta newspaper, The Statesman, quoted her as demanding that the 
Koran, the Islamic scriptures, be "thoroughly revised." She later claimed she 
was misquoted. She only advocated changes in Islamic law, she said, to give 
women the same rights as men. 
</P>
<P>
 The explanation didn't satisfy Muslim militants. The Sirat Majlish, said to be 
a front organization of the right-wing Jamaat-e-Islami, the country's largest 
fundamentalist party, offered $2,500 to anyone who would kill Nasrin. The 
Bangladesh Clerics' Council demanded she be hanged. Mosques throughout the 
South Asian country were used to demand the writer's arrest and public 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taslima Nasrin is a creature of Satan," one cleric said from the pulpit of 
his mosque in the southern city of Khulna. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's strike was meant to further pressure the government to arrest 
Nasrin and execute the doctor-turned-writer. Although the danger of mob 
violence seemed very real, officials were painfully slow to react. It was more 
than a week after the $2,500 price was put on Nasrin's head that the Home 
Ministry warned fundamentalist groups against issuing threats or taking 
vigilante action. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Bangladeshi newspapers said Nasrin was seeking asylum in the United 
States. "Any time, the fundamentalists will kill me," she was quoted as saying. 
"The government is against me." 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Dhaka said the mission was in contact with Nasrin 
but declined to make details public.  
</P>
<P>
 Nasrin, 31, has provoked enormous controversy by attacking religion and 
marriage and endorsing free love. A book she published a year ago, "Shame," 
offended many Bangladeshis with its accusations of Muslim persecution of the 
Hindu minority. It was banned. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahfuz Anam, editor of the Daily Star, an independent Dhaka daily, believes 
the uproar over Nasrin betrays the country's failure, after 16 years of 
strongman presidential rule ended in 1991, to deal with pressing social and 
economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The secular parties have failed to really provide any solutions to the 
problems of the moment," Anam said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to Nasrin's situation, Indian-born novelist Salman Rushdie, himself 
under an Islamic death sentence since 1989, accused Bangladesh's authorities of 
cowardice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is even more upsetting that the government has caved in to the demands 
from the fundamentalist groups, even though we know those factions are not very 
strong in Bangladesh," Rushdie was quoted as saying in Norway's Dagbladet 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fear for her life, should she be arrested," he said. Rushdie spoke during a 
secret stay in Oslo this week to visit William Nygaard, who was shot and 
seriously wounded in October after publishing in Norwegian "The Satanic 
Verses," the book by Rushdie that incited Iran to offer a reward to any Muslim 
who kills the author.

PASSENGER WHO DIED OF TB MAY HAVE EXPOSED OTHERS ON FLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal investigators have begun warning several hundred passengers who took 
United Airlines flights from Baltimore to Chicago and from Chicago to Honolulu 
May 11 that they may have been exposed to tuberculosis by a woman who died of 
TB after her arrival in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Several infectious disease specialists said Thursday the risk that she 
infected other passengers on the two flights is small because the disease is 
usually spread among people who have spent prolonged periods of time in close 
proximity -- such as family members. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, they said the risk may have been heightened by the confined 
quarters of an airline cabin and the tendency of modern air-handling systems to 
circulate stale air along with fresh air from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, a native of Korea who lived in Japan for the last 12 years, spent 
about a month visiting friends in Maryland's Howard County before boarding 
United Airlines Flight 493 in Baltimore. In Chicago she changed planes to 
United Flight 47, then landed in Hawaii so sick she was hospitalized 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuberculosis is a bacterial disease spread in airborne droplets by coughing, 
sneezing and -- in some cases -- talking. The disease, which usually attacks 
the lungs, causes chest pain and shortness of breath.

U.S. SUIT ON TRACTOR IN RAT HABITAT DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. attorney's office has dropped a civil action involving a farmer's 
tractor, which allegedly was used to destroy the habitat of endangered Tipton 
kangaroo rats. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agents confiscated Taung Ming-Lin's tractor in 
February and told him that because his land included the rodent's habitat, he 
could not farm on most of his 723 acres of rural western Kern County land.But 
the action involving the tractor was dismissed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The office decided that the most efficient handling of the case was to let 
the criminal process run," U.S. attorney spokeswoman Linda Wodarski said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lin still faces a criminal charge of violating the Endangered Species Act and 
could be jailed for up to one year and fined $200,000 if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Lin's attorney, Daniel Rudnick, said the dropping of the civil suit was "a big 
win." But he said he did not know why the government decided not to pursue the 
lawsuit.

SENATE OKS STATEWIDE INDOOR WORKPLACE SMOKING BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN and MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a year of hard politicking, the state Senate gave its approval Thursday 
to a statewide indoor workplace smoking ban that could become one of the 
nation's toughest. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, which passed on a 22-9 vote, seeks to prohibit smoking in 
restaurants and most other indoor commercial and public buildings. But it was 
watered down during its tortuous path through the Senate and would allow 
smoking in bars and hotels, at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation must return to the Assembly for its approval. If the bill 
clears the Assembly, it would go to Gov. Pete Wilson, who has not said whether 
he would sign it. His Democratic opponent, Treasurer Kathleen Brown, has also 
taken no position. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood), the author, said the bill is 
"good for the health of California workers and business," even though it was 
softened from its original flat-out ban on indoor workplace smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman said he will bring up the measure quickly in the Assembly, where its 
passage is far from certain, even though the Assembly approved the bill last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman said he "never underestimates" the strength of the bill's opponents, 
the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past week, lobbying reached new heights. Senators who opposed it pulled 
several maneuvers in an effort to derail the bill, either by amending it or 
sending it back to committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Charging that 38 pro-tobacco lobbyists were working on the bill, Sen. Diane 
Watson (D-Los Angeles) called for an end to the delaying tactics, saying the 
longer the vote was postponed, "the more they're building their forces." 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman -- with his allies in the Senate, Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport 
Beach) and Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) -- lobbied senators in an effort to 
defeat what he saw as hostile amendments, including one that would bar cities 
from enacting local smoking bans. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman's legislation retains a provision that allows cities and counties to 
impose tougher smoking restrictions. Few local measures are as prohibitive as 
Friedman's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman, the Assembly Labor Committee chairman, portrayed his Assembly Bill 
13 as a "workplace" safety measure, aimed at protecting the health of 
nonsmoking employees from the ill effects of secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, Friedman agreed to exempt some workplaces such as truck cabs, 
65% of hotel rooms, hotel lobbies, hotel banquet rooms, large warehouses that 
employ fewer than 20 people, card clubs and designated smoking break rooms that 
meet as-yet-undefined ventilation standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would permit smoking on movie sets where smoking is part of the 
production, tobacco shops, medical research facilities, nursing homes and 
businesses employing five or fewer workers in which each employee agrees to 
allow smoking but no minors are allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would allow smoking in bars and card clubs at least until 1997, by 
which time occupational health officials would have to come up with safe 
ventilation standards. If no regulations are developed, the ban in bars would 
take effect. 
</P>
<P>
 If it becomes law, California's indoor workplace smoking ban would rival a 
proposal pending before the Maryland labor commissioner as the nation's 
toughest. The Maryland measure would prohibit smoking in almost all indoor 
workplaces, including restaurants and bars, and contains fewer exceptions than 
Friedman's bill. 
</P>
<P>
 A California initiative on the November ballot would override Friedman's bill 
if voters approve the proposition. Sponsored by Philip Morris, the nation's 
largest cigarette manufacturer, the initiative would generally permit smoking 
in restaurants and other establishments, and would bar cities and counties from 
imposing local smoking restrictions.CALIFORNIA STA

EXPLOSION OF AIDS CASES IN ASIA ALARMS U.N. HEALTH AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The estimated number of full-blown AIDS cases worldwide increased from 2.5 
million to 4 million in the last 12 months -- a rise of 60%, the World Health 
Organization said today. 
</P>
<P>
 Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest number of cases with 2.5 million, the U.N. 
health agency said. But Asia experienced an eight-fold increase of cases, from 
more than 30,000 to 250,000, it added. 
</P>
<P>
 "The global AIDS epidemic is now spreading in Asia faster than anywhere else 
in the world," Dr. Michael Merson, head of WHO's Global Program on AIDS, said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Merson is attending an AIDS conference in Tokyo. A copy of his statement was 
released in advance in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
 The WHO report said 16 million adults and 1 million children had been infected 
with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS, since the 
epidemic first took hold in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 WHO estimates that by the end of the century, between 30 million and 40 
million people will have been infected with the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 All the statistics are cumulative totals since records were kept, dating to 
the early 1980s, so the HIV figures include people who have gone on to develop 
full-blown AIDS and those who have died. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes on average 10 years between infection with HIV and the onset of AIDS 
symptoms. The virus can be passed on through unprotected sex, contaminated 
blood, shared syringes and from mother to child. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the United States accounts for about 42% of the reported AIDS cases, 
it represents 10% of the overall estimated total. By contrast, Africa accounts 
for 33.5% of the reported cases but more than 67% of the estimated total, 
according to WHO figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Africa now bears the heaviest toll, WHO is most concerned about 
the explosion in infections in more-populous Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 It said that in Thailand, HIV infection had spread from prostitutes and drug 
addicts into the general population. 
</P>
<P>
 The study said about 30% of intravenous drug users in Ho Chi Minh City, 
Vietnam, were infected by late 1993, up from 2% in late 1992. In the northeast 
Indian town of Manipur, in the Thai capital of Bangkok and the Myanmar capital 
of Yangon, about 50% of drug addicts were infected, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 Merson said WHO was also concerned about China because of the increasing rate 
of sexually transmitted diseases in many parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 China, with its population of 1.2 billion people, has reported only 35 AIDS 
cases to WHO, but a high rate of sexually transmitted diseases, such as 
gonorrhea, is often a sign of the AIDS virus.

SCIENTISTS ADD 1 'TOCK' TO WORLD'S CLOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One second was added to the world's clocks at midnight Thursday to compensate 
for a gradual slowing of Earth's movement around the sun, Britain's Royal 
Observatory said. 
</P>
<P>
 Highly accurate modern clocks have shown that Earth's movement is slowing, and 
the measurement of time has to be periodically adjusted to keep in step. 
</P>
<P>
 "The additional second to be added to the atomic clocks at midnight . . . will 
bring these most accurate instruments of the measurement of time back in line 
with the relationship between the sun and the Earth," the observatory's Dr. 
Kristin Lippincott said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time is completely artificial," Lippincott said. "All we are doing is taking 
two different ways of measuring time and making sure those two are harmonious." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1884, time has been measured on a zoning system that starts at the 
Greenwich Meridian, an imaginary line that lies at zero degrees longitude and 
runs through Greenwich. Nineteen seconds have been added to the world's clocks 
since 1972.

2 FEMALE CANDIDATES ASK AID OF INFLUENTIAL WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a county where female candidates have long complained of being ostracized 
by the male-dominated political establishment, two survivors of the June 
primary urged a bipartisan women's group Thursday to raise money and help break 
down the barriers that keep women from being elected. 
</P>
<P>
 The spirited program, which included verbal attacks against Orange County 
Republican Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes and other local conservatives, was 
sponsored by Women in Leadership, a fledging bipartisan group of moderate women 
who favor abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the group donated $15,000 to the campaign of Republican Marilyn C. 
Brewer, who won the nomination in the 70th Assembly District, and to Democrat 
Linda Moulton Patterson, who faces Republican Jim Silva in a November runoff 
for the nonpartisan Board of Supervisors District 2 seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, this race is about power, and it's about the good ol' boys system. . 
. . They don't want me on that Board of Supervisors," Moulton Patterson told 
the group of 80 Democratic and Republican women at the Pacific Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson also called on the group to work against Silva, who she 
asserted was the top vote-getter in the primary because he had mobilized the 
"radical religious right" and was backed by Reps. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden 
Grove) and Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have to do is let everyone know -- and especially women -- that this 
is about them and they must go out and vote," Moulton Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer, a founding member of the group, credited the membership for its help 
during her primary campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brewer, who was criticized during her campaign for not being conservative 
enough, distanced herself from the harsh rhetoric against party conservatives 
by other speakers. She explained later that she is trying to "build unity and 
to be a part of the Republican Party in this county." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a mainstream conservative candidate who happens to be a woman, although 
I did not run on the platform of being a woman," Brewer told the group during 
her speech. "I just happened to be a woman who had the right stuff at the right 
time. . . . I also happened to be a candidate who is pro-choice, but I did not 
run as a pro-choice candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints against conservative, male-dominated politics are not uncommon. Two 
years ago, Republican moderates -- feeling disenfranchised from the local GOP 
-- crossed party lines to support then-candidate Bill Clinton's campaign. 
Moderates also backed the unsuccessful 1992 Republican campaign of 
congressional candidate Judith Ryan, who challenged Dornan in the 46th 
Congressional District. 
</P>
<P>
 During Thursday's discussion, Republican political consultant Eileen Padberg, 
who managed Ryan's campaign, said abortion rights backers have "often felt 
pretty alone, particularly in the Republican Party -- and I have all the scars 
on my back to prove it." 
</P>
<P>
 Padberg implored the group to support Moulton Patterson's campaign. "We have 
got to stand up for her," she said. "This is about power and just don't forget 
it. Keep your eye on the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Padberg also urged the group to recruit candidates for city council races 
"because the (Republican) party is not going to help any of you. There's a 
number of candidates that were going to run for office and were threatened and 
abused by none other than our county chairman." 
</P>
<P>
 Padberg noted that Fuentes has yet to convene a meeting with the two 
conservative candidates who lost to Brewer to urge them to endorse the party's 
nominee. The losing candidates were Thomas G. Reinecke, the GOP's local vice 
chairman, and Irvine Councilman Barry J. Hammond. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinecke said this week that he is "keeping open his options" as he and his 
allies consider whether to run a write-in candidacy against Brewer in the 
November election. 
</P>
<P>
 In a later interview, Fuentes fired back, pointing out that Orange County 
Republicans had elected state Sen. Marian Bergeson of Newport Beach, Doris 
Allen of Cypress, and nominated Jo Ellen Allen, who lost a race two years ago 
against Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove). All three are anti-abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't tell me that the Republican Party is not the party of leadership for 
women in this community," Fuentes said. "The problem that some liberal women 
have is that many of the women who take roles of leadership in the Republican 
Party are conservative women, and they are opposed to conservative women having 
a role of leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer, the party's first abortion-rights advocate to be nominated for a 
legislative seat in 22 years, also was the first woman to be nominated in the 
70th Assembly District after five previous attempts by other women to unseat 
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach). Ferguson decided not to seek 
reelection, but instead plans to seek a seat in the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes said he was examining whether other party leaders would be violating 
their rules if they backed a write-in candidate in the 70th Assembly District 
instead of Brewer. 
</P>
<P>
 About Moulton Patterson, Fuentes said: "She knows very well that her message 
as a strident liberal Democrat is not viable in the Orange County community, 
and so she's trying to interject sexism and friction between men and women 
rather than have the light of day on the fact that she is a partisan liberal 
Democrat attempting to get elected."

DRIVER FLEEING POLICE MAKES A BIG SPLASH, THEN GIVES UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ and TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Americo Victor Morales knew he was in a tight spot when he looked into his 
rear view mirror early Thursday and saw the flashing lights of a police 
cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
 His license was suspended. He had pleaded guilty to drunk driving two weeks 
earlier. And the sports car he was driving belonged to a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 So the 35-year-old hair stylist said he put the pedal to the metal and led 
police on a high-speed chase from Santa Ana to Laguna Beach. Then, for reasons 
not entirely clear to Morales himself, he abandoned the car near the beach, 
dove into the chilly waters behind Las Brisas Restaurant and began swimming 
toward Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
 Police simply waited on shore for their man to tire himself out. After 
swimming to a sandbar about 200 yards out, police said, Morales made a U-turn 
and returned to shore and the waiting arms of officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I panicked," Morales said at the Santa Ana Jail Thursday night. "I know it 
sounds silly, but I just wanted to swim up onto the rocks and run and tell my 
friend to come get the (car) before they impounded it."  
</P>
<P>
 A female companion whom Morales left sitting in the car when he headed for the 
waves was questioned by police and released. Morales said she was a co-worker 
but declined to give her name. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, the bizarre incident began at 2:41 a.m. when a police 
officer spotted Morales driving erratically in the 1000 block of McFadden 
Avenue in Santa Ana and tried to pull him over. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignoring the flashing lights, Morales raced along city streets in Santa Ana, 
then turned onto the San Diego Freeway at Bristol Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chased by three police cars and a helicopter, the sports car reached speeds of 
100 mph, police said. Finally, it turned off on Jamboree Road and sped down 
Pacific Coast Highway into Laguna Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 According to police, Morales turned back into Newport Beach briefly, then 
headed back to Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But things got worse for Morales when the right front tire blew.  
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to keep going but the tire popped and it was nothing but rim," he 
said. "My friend was saying, 'They're going to catch you.' But I just told her 
I just wanted to get back to the house so I could get the car to my roommate." 
</P>
<P>
 When it became clear that the police were closing in, Morales abandoned the 
car just below Heisler Park. He said he ran down a steep cliff, jumped into the 
ocean and swam toward adjacent Rockpile Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the sight of a police boat speeding toward him -- its spotlight 
blinding in the darkness -- that convinced him to give up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I seen that boat coming toward me and I figured they'd probably try to drown 
me," Morales said. "So I started walking toward the sand." 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, Morales walked to shore in shallow water. Wearing only 
jeans and socks, he fell to his knees and surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
 "He pretty much gave up once he saw the boat," said lifeguard Tom Trager, who 
was called to the scene "to yank (Morales) out of the ocean if he started to 
sink." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was either extremely tired or under the influence of something, because he 
couldn't stand on his feet too well," Trager said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales was booked on suspicion of evading arrest and for traffic violations. 
Bail was set at $500.

PURSUIT, KILLING OF CAR-THEFT SUSPECT LEAVE NEIGHBORS SHAKEN; CRIME: POLICE 
CHASE A MOTORIST TO A QUIET HUNTINGTON BEACH STREET. AT ONE POINT, FRIGHTENED 
RESIDENTS, AWAKENED BY HELICOPTERS AND SIRENS, CAME FACE-TO-FACE WITH GUNMAN 
WHO WAS RUNNING THROUGH YARDS.

<P>
 A police officer shot and killed a cornered car-theft suspect on a quiet 
residential street Thursday morning after the man brandished a gun, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frightened residents of the 5900 block of Liege Drive said they were awakened 
by the sound of police helicopters and sirens, then were stunned to see the 
suspected car thief running through their yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just getting out of the shower, looked out my sliding-glass door and 
saw this guy jumping over my back wall," said resident Bernie Piazza, 40. "The 
door was wide open, so we thought he was going to come in the house. I grabbed 
my daughter and my wife and ran outside. We were really in a panic." 
</P>
<P>
 The dead man, whose name has not been released, was spotted at 6:11 a.m. at 
Warner Avenue and Pacific Coast Highway by an Orange County sheriff's deputy. 
The car that he was driving had been reported stolen in Los Angeles County, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff's deputy began pursuing the man on eastbound Warner Avenue and was 
joined by Huntington Beach police when the chase reached Springdale Street, 
said Huntington Beach police Officer Mike Corchoran. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver drove into an apartment complex in the 17000 block of Springdale 
Street, abandoned the car, and began running through the yards of single-family 
homes in a tract behind the apartment complex, leaping fences and walls as he 
tried to elude police, Corchoran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza's wife, Sue, said the family was horrified to come face-to-face with 
the man after running outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was going to shoot us, since he had a gun," Sue Piazza said. "We 
got down on the ground behind one of the cars. After we heard the gunshots, we 
headed toward the back yard. We didn't know what to do. We went outside 
thinking he was coming in." 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents peeked through windows as the drama unfolded on their street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard the police officer yell, 'Stop! Stop!' Then I heard two loud pops," 
resident Kevin Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman then ran between two homes across the street from the Piazza and 
Schroeder homes, followed closely by police. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he was finally cornered, he decided to pull a weapon and he was shot," 
Corchoran said of the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 Police found a handgun at the scene. The man, who was shot in the upper body, 
was taken to Huntington Beach Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 
7:02 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who gathered behind yellow police tape to watch investigators comb 
the shooting scene Thursday morning said the chase and shooting were upsetting 
because their neighborhood has been relatively safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid to leave for work now because I'm afraid my wife is going to sell 
the house," Schroeder said. "You just don't think something like this is going 
to happen in your own back yard." 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified 31-year-old officer who shot the suspect is a nine-year 
veteran of the force and has been placed on 72 hours' administrative leave, a 
routine procedure in such cases, Corchoran said. 
</P>
<P>
 As is the case in all officer-involved shootings, the shooting is being 
investigated by the Orange County district attorney's office.

UNCLE TO THE RESCUE; CRIME: NEWLY ARRIVED PERUVIAN MAN, ALREADY VICTIMIZED BY 
U.S. THIEVES, CHASES A SUSPECTED ABDUCTOR WHO RELEASES HIS YOUNG NIECE. 
</P>

<P>
 On the day Hernan Salazar arrived here from Peru to visit his sister, thieves 
stole his luggage from her car. Then, not long into his visit, a man tried to 
kidnap his 7-year-old niece. This time, Salazar fought back. 
</P>
<P>
 Salazar, 30, was trying to deal with the loss of his luggage when a man 
slipped into his sister's apartment and lifted Fabiola Lopez from her bed, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man got in through an apparently unlocked sliding door and walked out with 
Fabiola flopped over his shoulder, awakening other family members. They ran out 
of the apartment screaming for her.  
</P>
<P>
 Salazar said he spotted the man outside, and shouted in Spanish for him to let 
go of the girl. The abductor dropped her and fled, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Salazar, a former police officer in Peru, alerted a Tustin police officer who 
was giving a driver a ticket, and police soon swarmed the area. A police dog 
followed a scent to some bushes, where Pablo Vasquez Bojorquez, 35, was hiding, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bojorquez, a Tustin ice cream vendor who lives across the street from the 
family, was being held on suspicion of kidnaping and burglary Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 Tustin police Sgt. Mike Pettifer said Bojorquez told investigators he ran into 
the Lopez apartment for refuge when two men tried to rob him. When he saw 
Fabiola in bed -- in the arms of her sleeping grandmother -- he figured that 
the robbers would not attack him on the street if he had a little girl with 
him, Bojorquez reportedly told police. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a new one to us," Pettifer said of Bojorquez's explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Salazar, 30, said he was thankful his niece was not hurt. But "things have not 
gone well for us here," Salazar said. "I'm going back to Peru as soon as 
possible."  
</P>
<P>
 He plans to stay as long as police need him to resolve the kidnaping case.  
</P>
<P>
 Fabiola's mother, Berta Lopez, was still shaken Thursday  
</P>
<P>
 "What intentions did the kidnaper have when he grabbed her?" she said. "Did he 
want to violate her? Kill her? I don't even want to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, 33, a homemaker and baby-sitter, said her world would have been ruined 
if her only child had vanished.  
</P>
<P>
 "I came here from Peru five years ago to try to make a better life for my 
daughter," she said. "Finally, a year and a half ago, I was able to go back to 
get Fabiola and bring her here." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday night, her family had had a reunion, eaten a Peruvian dinner of 
rice and chicken and talked late into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 About half an hour after Fabiola and her grandmother went to sleep in a bed 
set up in the living room, the grandmother felt someone take her. 
</P>
<P>
 At first she thought Fabiola's father, Luis Lopez, had gotten her out of bed 
to take her to the bathroom.  
</P>
<P>
 "I yelled to my daughter, 'Is Luis there with you?' " Eloina Salazar, 59, 
said. "When she said yes, I yelled that someone took the child." 
</P>
<P>
 Fabiola's mother said that "in the moment the man took her and I ran out of 
the apartment screaming her name, I thought of Polly Klaas," she said. Klaas, a 
12-year-old from Petaluma, Calif., was abducted from her bedroom last year and 
strangled. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernan Salazar also sped out to the street in his undershorts, yelling 
"Security! Policia !" 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had stopped to put on pants, who knows how far he could have gone," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hernan Salazar found the alleged kidnaper on the street, he ordered him 
to drop Fabiola. He ran after the man after he dropped her, but gave up the 
chase when he saw another man, who he thought might be an accomplice, get out 
of a nearby car. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding an officer who spoke Spanish was lucky, Salazar said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If he didn't understand Spanish, he probably would have thought I was crazy," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin police officers found a pair of sandals the alleged kidnaper kicked off 
during the chase, and waved them under the nose of Artur, a German shepherd, 
who followed it to the shrubs.  
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said she plans to move out of Tustin to an apartment building with 
secured entrances. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Fabiola, known as "Fabby," danced around her apartment in a 
summer dress and looked forward to going swimming. She was pleased that her 
mother had promised to buy a VCR and videos so she could watch her favorite 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
 All Fabiola remembered from the abduction, she said, was that a man picked her 
up and walked outside with her.  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was my uncle Hernan," Fabiola said. "Nothing like this has ever 
happened to me before." 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Bojorquez could face more than nine years in state prison, 
deputy public defender Robert A. Knox said. He remains in custody on $50,000 
bail. Police said there apparently was no accomplice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the uncle did the right thing," Pettifer said. "He confronted the guy 
verbally enough to get the girl back, but not enough to cause harm to him or to 
the girl. He's more or less a hero."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; REAL LIFE 'WAR OF THE ROSES' RAGES ON 
</P>

<P>
 A Laguna Beach woman, convicted of enlisting two men who used a burning flare 
to force her ex-husband into signing a property settlement, has agreed to 
settle a civil lawsuit filed by her former husband. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement Monday came moments before a trial was scheduled to begin into 
an assault and battery lawsuit brought by Harold Ruppert, 68, against his 
ex-wife, Helen Ruppert, 64. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. The lawsuit arose out of a January 
1991 incident in which Helen Ruppert hired two men who forced her ex-husband to 
sign a $600,000 property settlement by holding a burning flare close to Harold 
Ruppert's groin. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard William Nimmo and Ralph Thomas Pueschel later pleaded guilty to 
assault, extortion and false imprisonment and received jail sentences of five 
months and four months, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Nimmo and Pueschel testified against Helen Ruppert, who was sentenced to 
informal probation and fined $10,000 after her conviction on charges of 
conspiracy, extortion, burglary and assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal case was likened to the film "The War of the Roses" as details 
emerged about the Rupperts 3 1/2-year marriage and bitter post-divorce battle 
over $11 million in assets. Although the couple had been divorced for five 
years, they continued to share the same house overlooking the Pacific in Laguna 
Beach because of their inability to agree on a property settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 William Woo, a Santa Ana lawyer who represented Harold Ruppert, said Thursday 
his client was happy with the settlement of the civil case. "It has resolved 
numerous issues that clouded over both parties for many years," Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer said the fact that Pueschel was present and ready to testify in the 
case "hastened the settlement significantly." The ex-husband was seeking 
unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Ruppert's attorney, Lawrence Morse of Alhambra, was unavailable for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Woo said the legal battles between the Rupperts were far from over. Woo said 
he recently filed another lawsuit on behalf of the ex-husband challenging Helen 
Ruppert's interest in the Laguna Beach home, which Helen and Harold Ruppert 
continue to share. DAVAN MAHARAJ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; FIREWORKS EXPECTED TO LURE CROWDS

<P>
 Thousands of people and heavy traffic are expected near Mile Square Regional 
Park for the annual Fourth of July fireworks spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only problem we have is with the traffic and it usually focuses on the 
Fourth of July around the fireworks display time," said police Sgt. Dann Bean. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Crandall, co-chair of the 12th annual Fourth of July Fiesta, which opens 
today at 5 p.m. at the park, said that it will be the biggest fireworks show in 
Orange County. He said that 10-inch shells will be exploded for the grand 
finale and will spread 300 yards across the sky. The fireworks show is 
scheduled to start at 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The fiesta, sponsored by the Fountain Valley Chamber of Commerce, continues 
through Independence Day. The event features 23 carnival rides and 50 vendors, 
including chiropractor services, palm reading and pizzas. 
</P>
<P>
 Crandall said that this year, admission will be one price: $5.95 a person. The 
price includes unlimited use of carnival rides and entertainment, such as 
country-Western music and an "oldie but goodie" band. 
</P>
<P>
 Crandall said about 40,000 people are expected to attend the four-day fiesta. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the anticipated large crowds, residential streets near the park 
will be barricaded to restrict parking for residents only, Bean said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police will also patrol the fiesta on foot and private security will be 
provided by the promoter of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Crandall said for the first time, the chamber hired the promotions firm of 
Hassett & Davis Entertainment Inc. of Long Beach to put on the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "They pitched their services to us and the chamber looked at it and felt it 
was a wise idea to do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, the chamber called on more than 100 volunteers to help out. "It 
was draining on people," Crandall said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fiesta will be open until midnight tonight. Hours Saturday, Sunday and 
Monday, are noon until midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 The fiesta will be held on the city-operated portion of the park off 
Brookhurst Street and Heil Avenue. Parking is available at the Fountain Valley 
Recreation and Cultural Center. DEBRA CANO

 Two homes were evacuated Wednesday while sheriff's deputies deactivated 
explosives found in a back yard and driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 A homeowner called the Sheriff's Department about 5 p.m. after discovering 
plastic one-liter bottles containing chemicals, Lt. Daniel Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 A hazardous-devices squad defused them and found three other bombs that 
already had exploded at the same home, causing extensive damage to the driveway 
and landscaping, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators later arrested two 16-year-old boys, one from Dove Canyon and 
one from Lake Forest, on suspicion of making the explosives, a felony. The boys 
were released to the custody of their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the devices apparently were made in the boy's Dove Canyon home and 
thrown over a hillside, landing in a driveway and back yard, Lt. Daniel Martini 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt, but the explosives could have caused "extensive damage" in 
the neighborhood, populated mostly by young families with children, Martini 
said.TAMMY HYUNJOO KRESTA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; CITY OKS STOP SIGNS FOR MACKENZIE STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of Mackenzie Street are breathing sighs of relief since the City 
Council agreed this week to try stop signs as a way to slow down speeders who 
use the residential street as a shortcut. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15 residents who voiced safety concerns at Tuesday night's council 
meeting erupted into cheers and applause when the council voted 3 to 2 to 
install the signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-way stop signs will be placed where Califia Drive intersects Mackenzie 
and where Stage Coach Drive meets Mackenzie. Motions last November and last 
month to place stop signs at those intersections had failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest method the city tried to slow traffic was placing pylons where 
Mackenzie intersects Pike Road and Costeau Street. The pylons were intended to 
narrow the street, forcing drivers to slow down to negotiate the turns onto 
Mackenzie. 
</P>
<P>
 City Engineer Ken Rosenfield said the simulated "chokers" were effective, 
decreasing traffic's median speed by about 4 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 However, residents challenged the June 14 speed survey, saying the high 
visibility of the speed-measuring hoses across Mackenzie made drivers slow 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have been lobbying government for 20 years to slow down cars on the 
street, which many drivers use as a high-speed thoroughfare between La Paz Road 
and Alicia Parkway. Although many of the residents had said they preferred 
speed bumps over stop signs, they were still pleased with the decision, saying 
they see it as proof the council is responding to their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor R. Craig Scott and Councilman Joel T. Lautenschleger voted against the 
stop-sign proposal, with Scott saying he believed drivers would probably just 
speed up after going through each sign, creating an even more dangerous 
situation.LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; PARTY TO BENEFIT MAKE-A-WISH EFFORTS

 Elvis fans and those nostalgic for the 1950s can indulge themselves and help 
make a wish come true for a dying child by Hula-Hooping it up at a Make-a-Wish 
Foundation fund-raiser on July 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Johnson, the executive director of Orange County's chapter of 
Make-a-Wish, will use his collection of thousands of albums from the '50s when 
he serves as disc jockey for the party from 6:30 to 11:00 p.m. at Crean 
Village, 2300 Mesa Drive, in Santa Ana Heights.Tickets are $50 and can be 
purchased in advance or at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 The party will feature "Nick '55," an Elvis impersonator. 
</P>
<P>
 Make-a-Wish's Orange County chapter, based in Irvine, has made the dreams of 
more than 700 children come true since 1983, according to Marlene Eckert, a 
vice president and board member. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have never turned away any child that is referred to us and who is 
medically qualified," she said. The foundation funds the wishes of children who 
have terminal illnesses or life-threatening diseases and who will probably not 
reach their 18th birthdays, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wishes range from puppies to computers to trips to Ireland and, most commonly, 
to Disney World in Orlando, Eckert said. 
</P>
<P>
 For ticket information, call the foundation at (714) 476-9474. LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; STRING OF BLACKOUTS FRUSTRATES RESIDENTS

<P>
 The gods of electricity appear not to have been smiling kindly on this city in 
the past two months. Unhappy residents and business owners have had their power 
go out four times since April 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could understand maybe once a year," said a frustrated Stacey Futterman, 
whose inactive garage door opener prevented her from taking her 17-month-old 
daughter to physical therapy during the latest blackout three days ago. "I can 
handle that, but not four or five times in a few months." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Larimore, San Diego Gas & Electric's Orange County spokesman, said that 
the string of blackouts is unusual but that they are all unrelated.

 The first Laguna Hills power outage occurred April 23, when an underground 
cable malfunctioned, cutting electricity to 487 customers for six hours, 
Larimore said. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 3, a connection in the underground circuit system failed, shutting down 
power to 3,350 customers for 3 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Those same 3,350 customers also lost power on May 21 for two hours, when wires 
connected to a power pole sagged, Larimore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's blackout was the longest, with the lights going out on 3,350 
customers at 9:40 a.m. and not being fully restored until midnight. A faulty 
underground cable caused that blackout, Larimore said.LYNN FRANEY

 A 16-year-old youth has been arrested in connection with the slaying of a 
28-year-old man who was stabbed and shot during a confrontation Sunday 
afternoon, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager, whose name was not released because he is a minor, is suspected 
of plunging a knife into the chest of Heriberto Carachire of Santa Ana in the 
400 block of Orange Avenue.A second teen-ager, suspected of shooting the victim 
in the leg, remains at large, Lt. Robert Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we first reported this, we thought the victim had been killed by a 
gunshot," Helton said. "But an autopsy revealed that (an apparent) gunshot 
wound to the chest turned out to be a knife wound instead." 
</P>
<P>
 Carachire, who was in his car at the time of the 3 p.m. attack, managed to 
drive to his home nearby, where paramedics were called. Helton said the victim 
was a known gang member and that the confrontation was with rival gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager, a resident of Santa Ana, was arrested Wednesday night as while 
walking in the 500 block of East Walnut Street. Helton said the suspect was in 
possession of a knife that authorities believe is the murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some breaks have gone our way in this case and we've had witnesses come 
forward with good information," Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect is being held at Juvenile Hall on suspicion of murder. GREG

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; CANCER GROUP OFFERS SPIRITUAL SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Support groups for women with breast cancer typically have emotional and 
educational components. But a 7-month-old group at Jewish Family Service of 
Orange County offers an additional dimension -- a spiritual one. 
</P>
<P>
 According to facilitator Nancy Raymon, the frightening experience of 
contemplating one's mortality can lead to spiritual growth when people embrace 
their religious traditions for solace. "But many people need help with that," 
Raymon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Jews "find it hard to relate to their religion as a source of strength," 
she said, even though they "feel very socially Jewish and feel very culturally 
Jewish." 
</P>
<P>
 "But when faced with a serious illness or a disaster in their family, they 
look for something and they want to go back to their heritage," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mel Roth, executive director of Jewish Family Service, said the group is open 
to anybody, regardless of their religious beliefs, but "we do emphasize the 
Jewish approach to healing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Judaism places great value on life and the human body," Roth said. "Rather 
than dwelling on the tragedy of the illness, one can take the tragedy and find 
gains in it. We learn from life's pain how to enhance the quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Raymon, a clinical nurse specialist who has worked exclusively with breast 
cancer patients for the past nine years, said she found comfort during a 
personal crisis by turning to her faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a serious illness myself, and when I was going through that I was 
looking for help," she said. "I had a very positive experience with my rabbi. 
It was a very growth-inducing experience for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The 44-year-old Irvine resident describes her work with the group as a 
"wonderful experience" that has helped her spiritual growth process continue. 
</P>
<P>
 For group member Laura Rosenbaum, a 49-year-old Laguna Beach resident, 
exploring breast cancer within the context of Judaism "has helped me sort it 
all out." 
</P>
<P>
 "The most poignant and most important of the sessions, the one I've gotten the 
most out of, has been the most spiritual one," she said, referring to a meeting 
led by Rabbi Elie Spitz of Congregation B'nai Israel in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenbaum visited several non-spiritual support groups after her cancer was 
diagnosed but found they did not meet her needs. She said the orientation of 
the Jewish Family Service group is beneficial, "even if we don't discuss 
anything spiritual at a session." 
</P>
<P>
 Raymon said the need for support groups is particularly strong in Orange 
County, because the breast cancer incidence rate here is twice the national 
average. About one in seven local women will develop breast cancer during their 
lifetimes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The support group meets from 7 to 8:30 p.m. on the first and third Tuesdays at 
Jewish Family Service's main office, 2029 W. Orangewood Ave. in Orange. The fee 
is $10 per session.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; CICERONE SELECTED DEAN OF UCI SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A UC Irvine professor has been selected to be dean of UCI's School of Physical 
Sciences, university officials announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Cicerone, chairman of the earth system science department in the 
physical sciences school, will take over as dean today. 
</P>
<P>
 He will succeed Dean Harold Moore, who took part in the University of 
California systemwide early retirement plan in early May. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's extremely well-known in his area of atmospheric chemistry," UCI 
spokesman Scott Nelson said of Cicerone. His list of research projects, 
education and work experience "reads like 'War and Peace.' He's clearly tops in 
his field." 
</P>
<P>
 Cicerone joined UCI's faculty in 1989, after working as a senior scientist and 
director of the atmospheric chemistry division of the National Center for 
Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cicerone was named founding chairman of geosciences -- now earth system 
science -- when he joined the university, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1970s, Cicerone conducted extensive research into ozone depletion 
by chlorine gas and concluded that rocket exhaust that churned hydrogen 
chloride into the stratosphere could damage ozone, Nelson said. He will lead a 
school known for its work in atmospheric chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of the National Academy of Sciences, he has also served as president 
of the American Geophysical Union -- the world largest society of earth 
scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 Among students, faculty and staff, Cicerone was most recently known for 
leading UCI's Academic Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force examined academic departments and schools at UCI and 
recommended ways that education at the university could be maintained and 
improved while cutting the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Cicerone got his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He obtained his master's degree in electrical engineering, and doctorate in 
electrical engineering and physics, both from the University of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 Searchers for a new dean at the physical sciences school considered only 
candidates from within UCI, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty decided by a 70-1 vote to conduct an internal search because they 
wanted to avoid costs associated with bringing in outside professors and they 
believed that qualified candidates already worked for the physical sciences 
school, he said.ALICIA DI RADO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA; CITY RENAMES CENTER AFTER SLAIN STUDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Honoring a slain college student, about 40 people gathered Thursday to 
dedicate the Cathy Torrez Learning Center in the city's historic downtown, 
Placita Santa Fe. The center was first dedicated last December, but after the 
stabbing death of the 20-year-old Torrez in February, the City Council decided 
to rededicate it in her honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Tina Lopez, Torrez's sister, said the center could become a symbol of all the 
things her sister had hoped to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people see a building here with walls and windows," Lopez told the 
gathering. "What I see here will change the senseless (death) into something 
meaningful for the community, turning tragedy into hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Torrez's body was found in the trunk of her car on Feb. 19, one week after she 
failed to return home from her job at a nearby drugstore. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal State Fullerton honor student was active in several community 
programs, which included teaching English and tutoring Spanish-speaking 
students at Valencia High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Nick Saucedo, pastor of Placentia First Church of the Nazarene, 
compared the petite Torrez to the small storefront center. "It's not an 
accident this center was named after Cathy Torrez," Saucedo said. "I remember 
her as a mighty mite who wouldn't give up. Well, we don't have a spacious room 
here, but a little can go a long way." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hope to offer a variety of educational programs at the center. 
Migrant education and English-as-a-second-language classes are held there 
throughout the week, and a series on health care will begin later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez also hopes to start a Girl Scout program at the center, similar to one 
she started at the Whitten Community Center two years ago. "It would mean a lot 
to me to have a Girl Scout program at the center named for Cathy," said Lopez, 
23. 
</P>
<P>
 During the dedication, Mary Bennett, Torrez's mother, helped unveil a plaque 
featuring a portrait of her daughter that will hang in the lobby of the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Beside Torrez's high school graduation photograph is a brief biography that 
ends: "Although she is no longer here to realize that dream (of becoming a 
social worker), her memory and her belief in education and helping others will 
remain embedded in our hearts forever." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

 A 21-year-old man who doused himself with gasoline and then set himself on 
fire has died, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police identified the man as Robert James Binckley of Anaheim.He died shortly 
after 11:30 p.m. Wednesday at UCI Medical Center in Orange, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Binckley walked to Engel's AM/PM service station at 2401 W. Lincoln Ave. about 
2:15 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He paid for $1 worth of gas, emptied his pockets of personal possessions, sat 
down in the middle of the 16-pump station and ignited himself, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Binckley, a regular customer at Engel's, bought a packet of cigarettes along 
with the can of gasoline, said Kathy Engel, the station's owner. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were gas and flames everywhere," Engel said. "I really thought the 
place was going to go up in flames." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said bystanders put out the flames with a fire extinguisher. TAMMY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the objections of some neighbors, the City Council this week unanimously 
approved plans to build a volleyball court and new playground at Edison Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision caps two months of debate among residents of the College Park 
West area over whether the project would benefit or harm the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The park improvements were designed by a group of residents who have also 
raised more than $6,000 to pay for the project. The residents argued that the 
30-year-old park needs a face lift and that a volleyball court and jungle gym 
would attract more local families. 
</P>
<P>
 But other residents whose homes back the park opposed the improvement plan. 
They said it would bring loud, young people to the facility and create a crime 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 With council approval, supporters of the project plan to move ahead with 
construction of the volleyball court. The court should be opened later in the 
summer, said Lisa Chattler, who helped organize the park improvement project. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents still must raise about $6,000 to pay for a new playground, Chattler 
said. They'd also like to install some picnic tables.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA; LATEST BUDGET CUTS TAKE POLICE POSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a recent round of budget cuts, the city's Police Department has lost yet 
another position, reducing the department to 50 officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Police Chief Manuel Ortega had 54 officers for a city of about 
41,000. Since then, the city has grown both in population and in the amount of 
territory police officers must patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to complain," said Ortega, "but we're being asked to do more with 
less." 
</P>
<P>
 Ortega said that public safety is not being compromised by the reduction in 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We become the good soldier," Ortega said. "We suck it up and do more. The 
bottom line is to provide service." 
</P>
<P>
 One measure the department took to offset the cutbacks was instituting a 
12-hour, three-day workweek for patrol officers and a 10-hour, four-day 
schedule for detectives and motor officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The schedule was introduced in late 1992 and has reduced overtime and allows 
the department to keep officers on the street during peak hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Other steps Ortega said he may have to consider are pulling officers out of 
the DARE program and a countywide task force aimed at arresting drug dealers, 
and returning the officers to field work. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with these measures, Ortega said, residents will notice slower response 
times to some non-emergency calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be some things we won't be able to so as quickly or perhaps at 
all," Ortega said. "It may be that people who report a crime won't be answered 
as quickly as they are used to." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Ortega and City Manager Robert D'Amato said they do not expect future 
cuts in police positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not recommend going lower," D'Amato said. "We are at the bottom line 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 But D'Amato did leave the door open for future cuts if the state takes more 
money from the city's coffers than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have hit the bottom, but on the other hand, (the city's budget) has to be 
based on revenue," D'Amato said. "If the state hits on our budget, we will have 
to re-evaluate all employment." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 32-year-old man who may have interrupted two car thieves was stabbed several 
times early Thursday morning in front of his home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, whose name was not released, told police that he heard his dogs 
barking about 4 a.m. and went to check his truck, which was parked in the 
driveway of his home in the 500 block of Catalina Drive, said Sgt. Andy Gonis. 
</P>
<P>
 "As he was checking the truck, two males jumped out from the truck and stabbed 
him multiple times in the upper torso," Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonis added: "This is a nice neighborhood where this certainly is an unusual 
incident." 
</P>
<P>
 The two men ran and remain at large.

REGULATORS CRACK DOWN ON 'CYBERFRAUD'; COMPUTERS: THREE STATES ANNOUNCE ACTIONS 
DIRECTED AT SUSPICIOUS SOLICITATIONS MADE ON LINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Warning that fast-growing computer bulletin boards are becoming infested with 
financial scammers, state regulators issued an unusual alarm to investors 
Thursday and began a crackdown on the newest form of con artistry: 
"cyberfraud." 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri, New Jersey and Texas announced investigations and enforcement 
actions directed at individuals who solicit money for dubious or fraudulent 
investments through the financial bulletin boards of on-line services such as 
Prodigy, America Online and CompuServe. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig A. Goettsch, president of the North American Securities Administrators 
Assn., the organization of state regulators, said at a Washington news 
conference that the warning and crackdown are needed to prevent the bulletin 
boards from being "discredited as a haven for fast-buck artists." 
</P>
<P>
 The action also represents an effort by state regulators to assert 
jurisdiction over financial solicitations on the bulletin boards, even if the 
messages are posted from other states or countries. The Securities and Exchange 
Commission enforcement staff confirmed Thursday that the federal agency is also 
looking into the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulletin boards such as Prodigy's "Money Talk" and America Online's "Investors 
Network" are electronic forums in which subscribers can post notes and exchange 
information about stocks and other investments. They have become popular among 
small investors who have home computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Prodigy, for example, says its bulletin board for financial topics is one of 
its most popular, with as many as 5,000 messages and replies posted daily. 
Regulators say penny-stock scammers have moved onto the bulletin boards, hyping 
thinly traded low-priced stocks by posting notes with wildly inflated claims 
about the companies' prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 The messages are often heavy with exclamation points and capital letters, 
claim inside knowledge of recent developments and assert that the stock price 
will rocket once the information becomes public. Enough bulletin board users 
are taken in, regulators say, to drive up prices and enable the scammers to 
reap a quick profit. Typically, the stocks' prices collapse soon afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulators issued a 10-page "Investor Bulletin" on Thursday warning 
bulletin board users to be wary of messages claiming inside knowledge of major 
developments at companies. They also provided examples of solicitations for 
nonexistent mutual funds and of illegal electronic chain letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Ek, a spokesman for Prodigy, denied Thursday that the problem is 
widespread and said the company has received no complaints from subscribers. A 
spokeswoman for America Online said that service has not received complaints 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 The on-line services say they are cooperating with regulators but are not 
equipped to police the thousands of messages posted daily. They also say it is 
not a proper role for service operators to limit the free flow of 
communication, although on-line services often censor sexually explicit or 
politically offensive messages. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether electronic services can or should be responsible for messages 
transmitted over their networks is a hotly debated issue in the computer world. 
</P>
<P>
 In an enforcement action announced Thursday, Missouri Securities Commissioner 
John R. Perkins issued a civil cease-and-desist order against ETC Industries 
Inc., a Vancouver, Canada,British Columbia, company that says it is developing 
an electric car, and its president. 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri said that on April 13, an individual giving his name as K. Sean 
Liebscher posted a message on Prodigy under the heading "$.35 moving to $2.00." 
The note said ETC had developed a prototype electric car that could go faster 
than 90 m.p.h., to be marketed by summer. The note said the company expected to 
make a $1-million profit the first year and that it was "stock undiscovered at 
3/8 and Prime for Breakout!! This is an excellent opportunity to get in on the 
ground floor for an industry ready to EXPLODE!!" It predicted that the stock 
would soon zoom to $2.40 per share. 
</P>
<P>
 Only days later, after other bulletin board users accused him of having a 
vested interest in the company, did Liebscher acknowledge in another posting 
that he was a shareholder and that his father was president of the company. 
Missouri said it took action because ETC's shares were not registered for sale 
in the state and therefore the initial message represented an illegal 
solicitation to invest. 
</P>
<P>
 K. Sean Liebscher, ETC president, characterized his son's actions as "no big 
deal" and denied that the messages constituted a solicitation to invest. He 
added: "If they ask us to cease and desist, we will. We're not really doing 
anything."

 BankAmerica Corp. said Thursday that it had pumped an additional $50.5 million 
into two money market funds it sponsors to cover losses the funds incurred in 
selling off securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Those securities are believed to be exotic "derivative" investments, although 
the bank did not specify them as such. 
</P>
<P>
 The capital infusion into the $680-million Pacific Horizon Government Fund and 
the $4.5-billion Pacific Horizon Prime Fund came on top of a $17.4-million 
capital addition the bank made to the Prime Fund earlier this quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken together, the infusions from corporate sources will reduce its after-tax 
earnings for the second quarter ended Wednesday by $40 million, BankAmerica 
said. The company said it "continues to expect" that the quarter's earnings 
will exceed first-quarter earnings of $1.27 per share. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers said the capital infusions were surprisingly large. "That's a huge 
number," said a fund manager at a rival investment firm.

 In the news: Here's more evidence that CBS Inc. will soon merge with the QVC 
home shopping network, says comedy writer Bob Mills: "Halfway through the 'CBS 
Evening News' last night, Dan Rather sold his sweater to a viewer who had 
called in." 
</P>
<P>
 If the CBS-QVC merger goes through, it will be worth $3 billion, says comedy 
writer Tony Peyser: "The deal will involve either 40 million shares of stock or 
55 million lovely cubic zirconium pendants." 
</P>

 Peyser adds that CBS chief executive Laurence Tisch has personal reasons for 
pushing the deal: "This way he can shop at home for new affiliates."

 A patrolman saw the car a few minutes later and pulled it over. He told the

LAUGH LINES; RARE TALENT ONLY A SPIDER COULD APPRECIATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have an unusual talent. I catch flies with my bare hands. 
</P>
<P>
 I know there aren't many people who would brag about that. But there are even 
fewer who can do it, and I have learned not to question the fact that God gave 
me this talent rather than a great singing voice or a distinguished acting 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 As Krishna told Arjuna: You gotta be who you gotta be, babe. (Or maybe it was 
Sammy rapping with Frank in "Ocean's Eleven.") 
</P>
<P>
 I won't tell you how I do it. Maybe the Maharishi gives away the secret to 
eternal bliss, but we're talking real talent here. I will only say I learned it 
in Boy Scouts -- who says Scouting doesn't stick with you? -- and over the 
years, I have captured thousands of flies. (I usually practice catch and 
release.) 
</P>
<P>
 I respect my quarry as much as any hunter. He is courageous. He is cunning. 
Most of all, he is easy to crush between your fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 I know how that sounds. I'm sure you've known someone like me. Well, you 
probably wouldn't admit knowing him now, but you might remember him from grade 
school. He was the one who walked up to you on the playground and asked if you 
wanted to see him turn his eyelids inside out like an iguana. 
</P>
<P>
 You probably said, "No thanks." 
</P>
<P>
 On the whole, fly-catching is not well regarded by the public. People have 
their prejudices and that's all right. I don't brag about my ability. But I do 
keep it in mind when I hear someone else boasting about the executive position 
she just landed with a Fortune 500 company. 
</P>
<P>
 "But can she catch a fly with her bare hands?" I wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't spend much time catching flies anymore. I like knowing I can if I need 
to, though, and lately I had begun to fear that my abilities were waning. So it 
was with a certain amount of trepidation that I took my family camping 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew I would be facing my special adversary on his home territory -- a 
public campground redolent with sun block and used Huggies and the noise of 
radios tuned to the "all-day, all-night, no-news, no-sports, 
no-breaths-between-words speed metal station." 
</P>
<P>
 I eased into the confrontation. On the first evening, I had two beers, just to 
get that loose body awareness you must have in a physical confrontation. Next 
morning, my wife and son went for a boat ride. "Are you coming?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 I looked up from my breakfast -- two eggs fried, three small pancakes, a glass 
of orange juice for fluid -- and saw them gathering outside the fire's circle 
and warm family camaraderie. A big fly, so black it was like a null spot, 
hovered. My eyes met his. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," I said. "I'd better stay." 
</P>
<P>
 How could I explain that in staying I would not be forsaking my manhood but 
proving it? When they left, I picked up my book and lay on my cot under an oak 
-- the ceremonial invitation to battle. They came slowly at first, then more 
quickly, pressing from all sides. This was so predictable that a smile crossed 
my face. I realized that they didn't know who I was. Somehow, their genetic 
memory had betrayed them. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, my movements were erratic. I missed several captures, which only 
encouraged them. Then, from somewhere, I felt my body take control; my mind 
receded and became a spectator. I captured my first fly of the day -- a small, 
young one -- and placed its body on my left knee as fair warning. 
</P>
<P>
 My sense of honor compels me to announce myself to them. If the flies came in 
now, the resulting carnage would not be my responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 They attacked with renewed fury, trying to overwhelm with sheer numbers. It 
was a terrific fight, but when it ended, when my wife and son drove into the 
campsite, I had prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 "How was your morning?" my wife asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Great," I smiled. Then I kissed her -- hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ooh," she said. "Have you been catching flies again?"

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; HEALTHFUL ROUTINE DOES NOT WEIGH ON TEENS' 
LIFESTYLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASMINE SHOUKRY, Jasmine Shoukry is a June graduate of Sunny Hills High 
School in Fullerton, where this article first appeared in the student 
newspaper, the Accolade. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Exercising regularly and following a healthy diet have become a lifestyle for 
many teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Five students from Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton -- all June graduates 
-- tell why they work out. Each student's health-consciousness varies in 
degree, but none said they feel it is a burden. 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Kranz 
</P>
<P>
 Kranz's idea of a good time is riding stationary bikes, logging miles on a 
treadmill and climbing steps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just love to work out," said Kranz. "Like guys like football, I like 
working out." 
</P>
<P>
 Kranz said a good workout energizes her, even if she arrives at the gym 
feeling sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can go to the gym (feeling) kind of lazy, and (exercising) pumps me up," 
Kranz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before she started exercising regularly, Kranz had another method of dealing 
with her fatigue: "I used to come home and take a nap -- every day," she said. 
"Now I go to the gym." 
</P>
<P>
 Kranz's workout routine generally runs a little over an hour. She walks on the 
treadmill for 30 minutes, rides the bike for 20 minutes and uses the 
Stairmaster for 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 When she's not in the gym, Kranz exercises at home. "I bought a little step, 
and I work out with that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kranz is something of a fitness connoisseur after having watched ESPN's "Body 
Shaping" program for five years and Ms. Fitness America Kathy Smith's exercise 
program "Walk America." 
</P>
<P>
 Kranz said she makes a point of getting at least some exercise every day, even 
if it's just doing stretching exercises while in front of the TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm going to sit in front of the TV, I might as well stretch out," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kranz said she is able to eat a lot but has never had a weight problem. 
However, she does monitor what she eats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't eat greasy food at all," she said. "I eat a lot of rice and salads. I 
eat a lot of bread. I can polish off a whole loaf of bread." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerusha Redford 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't work out to try to work something off," said Redford, who exercises 
to build muscle, increase her energy and relieve stress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never felt like I needed to lose weight," Redford said. "I just wanted to 
be more toned." 
</P>
<P>
 Redford uses aerobics to tone up the muscles she uses for dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 She does most of her exercising at home and only goes to the gym if she wants 
to lift weights. At home she uses step-aerobics and aerobics tapes and does 
calisthenics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to work around the rest of my schedule," Redford said. "I don't do it 
all in one segment." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does she allow herself to get into a routine. "I get really bored easily 
if I'm in a routine," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to be strong," Redford said. "It's a lot better to have strong 
muscles." 
</P>
<P>
 Karah Oliver 
</P>
<P>
 In her household, exercise is a family thing, Oliver said. "Everyone in my 
family surfs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Between volunteer work and baby-sitting, Oliver finds time to exercise for one 
to two hours, three times a week, at the gym. She stair-climbs for 40 minutes, 
runs for 10 minutes, lifts weights for 30 minutes and takes a step-aerobics 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like an idiot jumping up and down (in the class), but it's fun," 
Oliver said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Keller 
</P>
<P>
 Keller joined a fitness club last year and started watching what she eats in 
an effort to replace the exercise she had gotten taking dance classes for 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was cutting down on the dance (classes), so I thought I needed more 
exercise," she said. "I don't want to be overweight and out of shape when I'm 
older." 
</P>
<P>
 At the gym, Keller rides the stationary bike for 25 minutes, uses the 
Stairmaster for 20 minutes and lifts weights in between. "Sometimes I'll take a 
step class," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keller says she doesn't find it too difficult to resist fattening temptations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I eat three meals a day," Keller said. "When I snack, I try not to eat junk 
food." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Clodfelter 
</P>
<P>
 Clodfelter said she has no excuses for not exercising -- she works at a 
fitness center. "It helps because I'm already there, so it's easier to work 
out," she said. "I don't have to feel like I don't want to get off the couch or 
I don't want to drive down there." 
</P>
<P>
 Clodfelter keeps in shape with an hourlong gym workout. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she has a weakness for an occasional ice cream cone, Clodfelter 
watches what she eats. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm eating cookies, I'll eat . . . something low-fat," she said.

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; LET'S GET PHYSICAL; OBSESSION WITH WEIGHT AND 
DIET FEEDS ON ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AVERAGE JANE, When not in disguise, Average Jane is a student at Canyon High 
School in Anaheim, where this article first appeared in the student newspaper, 
the Smoke Signals. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You could say that I got trapped. I really could not escape; there was no one 
to help me -- victims were all around me, and they didn't even know that they 
were victims. I had always thought that the only victims were weaklings and 
silly impressionable girls, ones that succumbed to peer pressure too easily and 
followed trends and fads. 
</P>
<P>
 But me, I was a strong person and with my stout stubborn heart, no way . . . 
no possible way. I never listened to any one, not even myself. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was my downfall. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, the only enemy was my boyfriend, who nagged me about my 
weight once. So in my haughty pride I dumped him immediately. I figured that 
was about 145 pounds right there. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, slowly but steadily, I began to wonder: Am I fat? Am I overweight? Maybe 
Glamour or Vogue said that I could stand to lose a few pounds, but that didn't 
bother me. After all, what simpleton would put any faith in a magazine that has 
on one page an article titled "How to Pop Your Biggest Pimple," and on the 
next, "Homicidal Tendencies and You." 
</P>
<P>
 Then I got caught up in the web. 
</P>
<P>
 I began to exercise like crazy. I kept a diary of all of the foods I ate and 
their calorie count. Last summer I went on a 900-calorie-a-day diet of leaves 
and twigs. (Just in case some of you aren't proficient in the art of 
calorie-counting, 900 calories is about half of what you eat for lunch.) Then I 
tried a thick shake that supposedly replaces breakfast and lunch. But I gave 
that up two weeks later when I realized that my body waste came out looking 
remarkably like my breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, here I am now, eating normal food. I have come to terms with myself and 
my body, curves and all. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't think that my behavior makes me some strange creature. Or that no one 
can ever act like I did. I don't need you to tell me what I already know, that 
I shouldn't let that "stuff" affect me. I am an honors student, meaning that 
I'm pretty good at playing the game. And I'm a strong person, but it happened 
to me. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is immune.

CYBURBIA: THE GOODS; NOT BOUND BY LIMITS OF PAPER SIBLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cut into the granite in huge letters above the entrance to the main library at 
Penn State, my alma mater, were these words of wisdom: "A TRUE UNIVERSITY IS A 
COLLECTION OF BOOKS." I would look at those words and ponder, "So, why am I 
paying all this tuition when I could just get a library card?"  
</P>
<P>
 In the future, maybe all you'll need for a "true university" is a computer 
with a CD-ROM drive. These devices can access the vast amount of information 
that can be digitally stored on CDs in text, sound, graphics, photographs, 
animation and even video. 
</P>
<P>
 We're still in the early era of CD-ROM development, but with their capability 
to store so much data, it's not surprising that several companies have already 
put out CD-ROM encyclopedias. None of the ones now available come close to 
duplicating the comprehensiveness of heavy-duty encyclopedias such as the 
venerable Encyclopedia Britannica. But few people have that heady a reference 
work in their homes, anyway.  
</P>
<P>
 Although it's enormously pleasurable to sit down and browse through book 
volumes, there are advantages to the CD-ROMs, too. In addition to not being 
limited to print matter, they also can include electronic search tools, and 
they are generally much cheaper than their bound siblings.  
</P>
<P>
 To test three of the most popular CD-ROMs -- Compton's Interactive (available 
for about $80), Grolier Multimedia (about $99) and Microsoft Encarta (about 
$89) -- we tried an assortment of searches on all of them. Information was 
sought on the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech, military 
ranks, the Stonewall gay-rights riots, which just had its 25th anniversary, and 
Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai.  
</P>
<P>
 Compton's, although it looked rather nice on the computer screen, was the 
least useful, by far. Its so-called videos were often just still pictures of 
some person or object, with sound playing in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beethoven video, for example, shows a bust of Ludwig while a 35-second 
music clip and voice-over let you know he was an "extraordinary" composer who 
eventually went deaf. The video of "World War II" covered the whole war in 2 
1/2 minutes. As for the test searches, there was a 35-second audio clip of 
King's speech (but it wasn't easy to find), no listing of military ranks, no 
mention of Stonewall (and only a tiny bit of text on the gay-rights movement) 
and one sentence on Hokusai.  
</P>
<P>
 The flashy new version of Encarta did far better. It was a pleasure to use and 
includes the full text of the 29-volume Funk and Wagnall's New Encyclopedia. It 
has several engrossing animated videos to help explain natural and scientific 
phenomena, such as how glaciers are formed and how the eye focuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The photographs are often spectacular and there are plenty of them (5,567, 
according to Microsoft). Its browsing technique -- clicking on many of the 
words automatically takes you to other entries -- is seductive, and Encarta 
helpfully includes short bios on each contributor to the text. Microsoft also 
says that regular updates of the encyclopedia will be available.  
</P>
<P>
 As an information resource, Encarta gets mixed reviews. On the tests, the King 
speech got only 20 seconds (and the text entry on King is disappointingly 
short). There was no listing I could find of military ranks and no mention of 
Stonewall. Hokusai got an informative four paragraphs, but no pictures of his 
works.  
</P>
<P>
 The Grolier CD-ROM is the most clunky looking of the three, and it does not 
seem to be as comprehensive, in text or audio/visual materials, as Encarta. But 
it was sure fun to explore. Its search functions are very fast, easy to use and 
flexible in the ways you can explore the encyclopedia. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several somewhat obscure video clips -- such as a segment of Dwight 
Eisenhower's prophetic farewell-to-the-presidency speech -- that are 
fascinating. And the animation, including how a volcano is formed, was 
engrossing.  
</P>
<P>
 As for the tests: There were two 30-second audio/visual clips from the King 
speech, a full table of U.S. military ranks, an article on gay/lesbian activism 
that mentions Stonewall and a short entry on Hokusai, but no pictures of his 
works.  
</P>
<P>
 All three CD-ROM encyclopedias are available in both the Macintosh and Windows 
formats.

YOUR WHEELS: THE GOODS; DEVICE FLAGS YOU WHEN TO PUMP UP LOW TIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Convenience at one time was an electric starter motor instead of a crank. 
Today, cars have all kinds of gadgets, from power seats to automatic light 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
 But we still must manually check the air pressure in our tires by squatting 
down with a gauge, unscrewing a valve cap and taking a reading. And we have to 
repeat that on all four tires. 
</P>
<P>
 Tire manufacturers recommend we do this every month, but most of us don't 
bother. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government estimates that motorists driving on under-inflated 
tires consume an additional 21 million barrels of oil every year. The cost to 
consumers of this neglect is put at $2.2 billion for premature wear on tires 
and extra fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 But the money is the minor issue. An estimated 720 drivers lose their lives 
every year due to under-inflated tires, according to the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration. Among other problems, under-inflated tires 
increase stopping distance, reduce driver control and can cause tire failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a remedy for this neglect? One device worth considering is Tirecheck, 
a valve cap that can visually signal whether a tire is under-inflated. 
</P>
<P>
 Tirecheck screws onto the valve stem and shows a green flag as long as the 
tire is properly inflated. If the pressure drops about three pounds below where 
it started when the valve was screwed on, an orange warning flag pops out. 
</P>
<P>
 As Tirecheck is screwed onto the valve stem, it depresses the spring valve 
inside, releasing the tire's air to push against a membrane that senses 
pressure. As a result, it is crucial that the Tirecheck not leak, because the 
tire's regular valve is now open at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 John Thomsen, president of the Florida firm that makes Tirecheck, says the 
device has a square rubber ring that forms an airtight seal around the rim of 
the valve stem. If Tirecheck did leak, the orange flag should pop up and 
indicate a low pressure condition, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Tire companies decline to either criticize or endorse Tirecheck, although 
privately tire engineers say they are leery about any product that would keep 
open the tire valve. 
</P>
<P>
 After four weeks of using Tirecheck on my car, I haven't had any problems of 
air leakage; nor did orange flags pop out. Tirecheck has been tested and 
approved by regulators in Germany, where the device was patented. 
</P>
<P>
 Tirecheck is Thomsen's only auto product. The firm also makes medical devices, 
including an instrument used in open heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 A set of four Tirechecks costs $12.95 and can be ordered by calling (800) 
769-1396. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step in convenience would be a system that signals on the dashboard 
when a tire needs air. Such systems are under consideration by auto makers.

INSIDE LINE: OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; JUNK FOOD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate Agriculture Committee voted last week to drop plans to require the 
Agriculture Department to help high schools develop policies to ban junk food 
sales on school grounds until after lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Current regulations prohibit the sale of junk food in school cafeterias during 
lunch hours and permit school officials to impose additional restrictions on 
junk food sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), author of the original proposal, said it was 
designed simply to make it clear to local schools that they had the authority 
to ban junk food on campus if they so desired.

MY TURN: OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; VENDING HER SWEET FRUSTRATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY JOHNSON, Ashley Johnson is a recent graduate of Corona del Mar High 
School, where this article first appeared in the student newspaper, the 
Trident. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I walked on the Corona del Mar High School campus for the first time in 
my life, I was a tiny, lost, ex-private school girl. Gone was the safety of my 
uniform. Here you had to be an individual. Here you were a dork if you called 
break or lunch "recess." 
</P>
<P>
 All these were new challenges I had to face, but I still hadn't faced the 
biggest challenge of all: the vending machines! 
</P>
<P>
 In seventh and eighth grade, I didn't have the wonderful luxury of vending 
machines. I was forced to eat every day what my mother packed for me in my 
brown bag. When as a ninth-grader I encountered the vending machines at CdM, I 
went crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day I could buy a Coke and a candy bar to add some variety to my sack 
lunch. I think I lived off Johnny Apple Treats my freshman year. A key 
advantage to this was that my mother never knew just how much sugar I consumed 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of my freshman year, I started to lose my fascination with the 
vending machines. They had become just another ordinary part of my life. My 
visits to the vending machines became less and less frequent until, finally, 
they altogether stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 I am very relieved that my trips to the vending machines ended early in my 
career at CdM, because it became a total nightmare to visit them.  
</P>
<P>
 I hadn't been back to them in a long while when, as a senior, I had a craving 
for a Nestle Crunch Bar that I just couldn't resist.  
</P>
<P>
 As I drew closer to the vending machines, the noise became deafening as kids 
swarmed around, circling like vultures. I finally managed to get into the line 
for change -- where I was pushed and shoved as impatient underclassmen cut 
their way to the front of the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuming and frustrated after that experience, I managed to plow my way through 
the mass of bodies to the vending machines. Shrill voices pounded in my ears, 
crying "Can I have your change?" After I had made my selection, hands shot out 
trying to grab my change right out of the slot in the machine. "Don't touch my 
change, you scrounges!" I roared. I stormed off to complain to my best friend, 
who had wisely opted not to brave the machines with me. 
</P>
<P>
 My personal experience with school vending machines is definitely over. No 
matter how much I crave a Crunch bar.

INK: WILL SIMPSON FRENZY SURVIVE 3 INSTANT BOOKS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Paul D. Colford is a columnist for 
Newsday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Surely there are book buyers hungry for goods on the O.J. Simpson case, but 
will they still care next year? Beyond three new instant paperbacks just out, 
publishing insiders suspect the media frenzy in Los Angeles might exhaust the 
public's interest in any thoughtful hardcover that would follow later. As Simon 
& Schuster President Carolyn K. Reidy put it: "We may O.D. on O.J." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, an array of writers and literary agents has been sounding out 
publishers. Prominent among them is Joe McGinniss, whose bestsellers include 
1983's "Fatal Vision" about the Jeffrey MacDonald case. The writer's agent, 
Morton L. Janklow, says the book would explore the Simpson case and the notion 
of hero worship in the style of Norman Mailer's "The Executioner's Song," which 
offered a wide-angle view of the troubled world of convicted killer Gary 
Gilmore. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the publishers of the three paperbacks say advance orders for 
their books from retailers and wholesalers have swelled print runs into the six 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The first to reach stores is "O.J. Simpson: American Hero, American Tragedy" 
by Marc Cerasini, a New York writer and co-author of "The Tom Clancy 
Companion." Pinnacle Books, which announced a printing of 450,000 copies, 
started shipping copies to stores last Friday, only 11 days after the bodies of 
Nicole Brown Simpson and a friend were found outside her Brentwood home. 
Initial enthusiasm from booksellers prompted Pinnacle to produce an additional 
50,000 copies of what is essentially a biography that draws on previously 
published material and culminates in a day-by-day chronology of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming out of the pipeline today will be "Fallen Hero: The Shocking True Story 
Behind the O.J. Simpson Tragedy," written by former UPI reporter Don Davis and 
published by St. Martin's Press. The publisher, which counts Maria Eftimiades' 
best-selling "Lethal Lolita" (about Amy Fisher) among its true-crime quickies, 
says an initial printing of 500,000 copies will make "Fallen Hero" its biggest 
book of this type. 
</P>
<P>
 Instabook No. 3 comes from the senior editors of a supermarket tabloid that 
offers a sympathetic slant. "Juice: The O.J. Simpson Tragedy" was written by 
Larry Browne and Paul Francis of the Globe, whose current front page screams: 
"O.J. WAS FRAMED!" Globe Communications Corp., in a distribution deal with 
Carol Publishing Group, is planning to move 200,000 copies Tuesday. Globe Vice 
President Terry Raskyn says the writers will update their text if sales prompt 
the publisher to print additional copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone favors jumping into print on the sensational case. "Overall, I 
personally would not be interested in quickie books on O.J. Simpson, but in 
books about the underlying current of domestic violence and the battered-wife 
syndrome," says Robert Gottlieb, a high-powered literary agent who is executive 
vice president of the William Morris Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Another influential agent, Esther Newberg of International Creative 
Management, says three clients approached her with book ideas on the case and 
she advised them all to back off. "For the most part, it feels old to me," 
Newberg says, adding that if media saturation does not sour interest in the 
story, the daily disclosure of details about the killings could outpace a book 
writer's ability to produce a timely manuscript. 
</P>
<P>
 As for McGinniss, discussions about his latest enthusiasm invariably return to 
the fallout from "The Last Brother," his biographical look at Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy. The book was savaged by the critics last summer mainly because of the 
author's questionable sourcing and freewheeling attempt at a psychological 
profile. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon & Schuster, which published "The Last Brother," does not want McGinniss' 
next book. "I think we felt it was probably time for him to try another 
publisher," Reidy says. 
</P>
<P>
 Janklow, who argues that S & S "manhandled the book," adds: "All of that 
controversy has to be overcome, but the main thing is that Joe will be back to 
one of his greatest strengths, serious nonfiction. This book will be about 
America and race relations and coming out of the ghetto. There's a lot of meat 
to this story." 
</P>

 On the Racks: Rebelle, a glossy fashion and lifestyle magazine designed to 
celebrate multiculturalism, has officially premiered on newsstands following 
two test issues. Founded and produced by Ralph Clermont and Philippe Gelin, two 
Haitian-born photographers who have come together as Clerlin Inc., Rebelle bows 
with a report on black models, 50 pages of fashion statements from Puerto Rico 
and assessments of American music written by Senegalese singer Youssou N' Dour 
and other performers. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Afterwords: The Ballantine Publishing Group plans to put three of its authors 
on a group tour next month to promote their mysteries, which feature gay and 
lesbian protagonists. The writers are Michael Nava, the pen behind gay Los 
Angeles attorney Henry Rios ("How Town"); Sandra Scoppettone, creator of 
lesbian sleuth Lauren Laurano ("I'll Be Leaving You Always") and Ellen Hart, 
author of the Jane Lawless series, including the new "Stage Fright." Among 
their stops is a July 12 panel and autographing session at A Different Light in 
Los Angeles. . . .

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; CAUGHT UP IN AN ENCYCLOPEDIA OF LOVE; STARCARBON BY ELLEN 
GILCHRIST ; LITTLE, BROWN $22.95, 396 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE KENDALL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Admirers of Ellen Gilchrist's prior novels will know the complex genealogy of 
Olivia de Havilland Hand, part Oklahoma Cherokee, part North Carolina gentry, 
and will have met her when she was a spirited child living with her Oklahoma 
aunts and grandparents.  
</P>
<P>
 Until adolescence, when her mother's sister tracked her down in Tahlequah, 
Olivia had been oblivious of the Charlotte relations, but once aware that she 
not only had a living father, but a half-sister -- Jessie -- Olivia has come to 
know and love her newfound Carolina relatives. Her Cherokee mother had left 
Daniel Hand to return to Oklahoma and had died giving birth to the child her 
husband never knew existed.  
</P>
<P>
 Now Olivia has just finished her freshman -- and perhaps her only -- year at 
Chapel Hill and is paying a short visit to her father before returning to 
Oklahoma and the independent Western life she's missed. Her plan for the summer 
is to study Native American cultures and reclaim her heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Another priority is finding Bobby Tree, the rodeo rider who had been her 
high-school lover. A few tepid romances at the university have convinced her 
that he's her destiny, a fact that Bobby never doubted.  
</P>
<P>
 When Olivia left Tahlequah for Chapel Hill, Bobby, lovelorn and devastated, 
signed on as a hand at the Macalpins' Starcarbon Ranch in Montana, where he's 
worked himself up from useful to virtually indispensable. His employers, the 
Macalpins, have become surrogate parents for Bobby, the son of a feckless 
father and a long-vanished mother.  
</P>
<P>
 This volume of the Hand family chronicle is in continuous motion, pausing in 
Charlotte to renew acquaintance with Olivia's father; moving on to New Orleans 
to check up on Olivia's half-sister and her new baby; stopping in Montana where 
Bobby is about to leave Starcarbon for his reunion with Olivia; then 
back-tracking to Boston where Olivia's Aunt Helen lives with her Irish poet 
lover, Mike, but alighting most often in Tahlequah, the tiny Oklahoma town 
where Olivia learned to be the willful and endearing heroine she is. 
</P>
<P>
 A family tree at the beginning of the book is a considerate gesture, because 
the connections do tend to get literally out of Hand. Once we're oriented, 
however, these many lives and diverse loves exert considerable fascination, 
creating their own internal cohesion. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time we meet Olivia's summer school anthropology professor, Georgia 
Jones, M.D. and Ph.D., we're as ready as we'll ever be for a new character with 
a fresh set of romantic problems.  
</P>
<P>
 Georgia has left her medical practice to teach at the small Oklahoma college 
and decide how to spend the rest of her life, a decision complicated by the 
fact that she has fallen in love with a nuclear physicist with a serious 
commitment problem, as well as a few other personality quirks. In the course of 
sorting out her personal difficulties, Georgia not only manages to clarify 
Olivia's emotions, but provides us with an entirely different take on love. 
</P>
<P>
 Love, in all its guises and varieties, is the subject of this thoroughly 
engaging novel. Without scanting any of the usual manifestations, the author 
has included a few less frequently encountered.  
</P>
<P>
 There is the profound mutual love between Olivia and the grandparents who link 
her to her Native American ancestry, and the particular affection she feels for 
Helen -- her dead mother's sister and the renegade aunt who left her husband 
and five children to create another, far more difficult life in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilchrist explores the deepening ties between Daniel Hand and the unknown 
daughter he welcomed with all his heart, a love that filters down to unite 
Olivia with Jessie. There's also the mutual respect and trust between Bobby 
Tree and the Macalpins, contrasting with the loyalty Bobby feels toward his 
unfortunate but fundamentally decent father.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the youthful physical passion between Bobby and Olivia and the 
mature, but equally intense affair between Helen and Mike, there's the lifelong 
devotion of Olivia's grandparents, Little Sun and Crow. 
</P>
<P>
 When you include the pervasive love felt by each character for the land -- the 
stark beauty of Oklahoma and the gentle hills of Carolina -- the result is 
virtually an emotional encyclopedia.

RSVP / INTO THE NIGHT: SPAGO CROWD RISES TO THE OCCASION OF ECLIPSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 The Scene: Official opening of Eclipse, restaurant-baby of Bernard Erpicum, 
the former maitre d' of Spago, at the original Morton's site on Melrose on 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: About 160 of Erpicum's former Spago customers and slightly 
blase foodie friends (you know, another week, another restaurant) including 
Whoopi Goldberg with Herbert Ross, George Hamilton, Paul Reiser, Jon Voight, 
Tony Curtis, Roger Moore, Jacqueline Bisset, Tony Thomopoulos and Cristina 
Ferrare, Peter Coyote, Shirlee Fonda, Michelle Phillips, Ivan Reitman, Margaret 
and Howard Weitzman and artist Alexander Mihaylovich, whose paintings adorned 
the walls. Besides being the attorney who pulled out of the O.J. Simpson case, 
Howard is also the self-described "counselor who put this restaurant together." 
</P>
<P>
 Absent With Leave: Robert Shapiro, Simpson's defense attorney, was expected to 
attend, but at the last minute phoned Erpicum to say that he "will be there for 
you in soul and spirit, but I'm working around the clock on my preliminary for 
the morning."  
</P>
<P>
 No Show: Steven Seagal, a rumored Eclipse backer (and the face painted to look 
chiseled a la Mount Rushmore on the labels of the Steven Seagal Cabernet 
Sauvignon on every table). When the actor failed to appear by the time 
cappuccinos were served, one guest ventured that he was probably home crushing 
grapes.  
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: Eclipse investor Marty Ingels, explaining why he was carrying a 
placard that read, "LIMITED PARTNER (SILENT)": "I want people to know this is 
my first restaurant. They usually don't last very long, about a week or two, so 
I want to be as loud as I can during my short tenure as the Jewish Nicky 
Blair." 
</P>
<P>
 Also Quoted: "I said I'm going to win points and be here tonight because I 
know I'll get a good table next time. It's all about claiming your territory 
early, because if you come here and they put you in the wrong place you've had 
it," explained George Hamilton.  
</P>
<P>
 Chow: The meal consisted of highlights of the seafood-laden menu. There was 
the hors d'oeuvre of smoked Norwegian salmon wrapped around fresh spinach and 
horseradish cream served with cucumber vinaigrette; the appetizer of 
flash-grilled butterflied langoustines with charred-tomato green olive sauce; 
the entree of Norwegian salmon baked in parchment with a julienne of leeks, 
green onion, basil and tarragon. Among the myriad desserts were such exotica as 
frozen honey lavender nougat and lemon tarts with kumquat zest.

ANTI-SMOG PLAN COULD TOP $5 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The latest proposal for cleaning Southern California's smoggy skies could cost 
more than $5 billion annually and slow new employment by 63,000 jobs a year, 
posing slightly more of an economic burden than previous plans to curb the 
region's notorious air pollution, according to an economic analysis completed 
Thursday by air quality officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, achieving clean air would cost almost $1 per person in Los Angeles, 
Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties every day through 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast Air Quality Management District officials have called their latest 
smog control proposal, unveiled in April and scheduled for a vote in August, 
more business-friendly, flexible and economical than past versions. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite their efforts to curtail costs and spread the burden, air quality 
officials say a daunting price tag and slower job growth are unavoidable given 
the region's severe pollution. The $5.4-billion annual cost is a worst-case 
scenario, they say, explaining that it does not include new market incentives 
and pollution trading programs proposed by the agency to defray part of the 
expense for local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan's 106 proposed measures -- which would be implemented by local, state 
and federal officials -- include improved mass transit, electric car mandates, 
pollution fees on ships and cleaner solvents and paints.  
</P>
<P>
 The smog cleanup bill would be equivalent to 2% of the gross value of goods 
and services in the four counties, and the slowdown in annual job growth 
amounts to around half of 1% of the 10 million jobs that should exist by 2010, 
according to the AQMD's report. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at the big picture, it has a relatively small impact on the 
local economy," said AQMD Deputy Executive Officer Barry Wallerstein. "We know 
the issue of job impact is much more sensitive now, at the end of a recession, 
than in good times. But the bottom line is the same -- that the relative impact 
on the regional economy is minor." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry W. Wedaa, chairman of the South Coast Air Quality Management District, 
said that new anti-smog technologies actually would create jobs in the 
manufacturing and service industries in Orange County and throughout the Los 
Angeles Basin. "All these new systems have to be made someplace," said Wedaa, a 
Yorba Linda resident. "And I'm working on having it happen in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 More than three-quarters of the costs -- as well as the benefits of clean air 
-- would fall on Los Angeles County, which has the vast majority of cars, 
refineries and other smog-causing sources, according to the report. About 14% 
would be incurred in Orange County, 5% in San Bernardino County and 4% in 
Riverside County.  
</P>
<P>
 Ray Remy, president of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, called the 
economic report "an absolute dream come true" for every city trying to lure 
industries away from the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 "When every effort is being made to try to build a better business climate and 
image, how can you get excited about a report that proclaims we will have a 
$5.4-billion reduction in our economy and lose 63,000 jobs?" Remy said. 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD officials, however, emphasize that keeping the air dirty would be even 
more expensive than cleaning it up. 
</P>
<P>
 The region would save $6.3 billion to $6.9 billion per year due to fewer 
pollution-related deaths, reduced health care costs, improved traffic, enhanced 
visibility and other benefits. The net annual savings is about $1 billion 
compared to the costs, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic benefits of clean air always have been disputed, however, since 
estimates are based largely on economists who assign a value of around $3.5 
million for each person who dies prematurely from air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over the plan will culminate Aug. 12, when the AQMD board convenes 
a final public hearing and decides its fate. A revised clean air plan is 
required by law every three years. Under federal law, the AQMD and the state 
Air Resources Board have until November to approve an updated plan.  
</P>
<P>
 Since the local agencies have failed to meet past clean air deadlines, the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also has proposed a strategy for the Los 
Angeles Basin that has prompted even more concern among business and civic 
leaders. If the local agencies come up with better alternatives, federal 
officials have said they would soften harsher aspects of their plan, such as 
fees on the shipping industry and pollution limits on airline flights. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the AQMD plan, the costs of clean air would be borne by virtually 
everyone -- motorists, consumers, local industries and interstate businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Economist Sue Lieu, an AQMD program supervisor, said Southland industrial 
plants would bear 36% of the annual expenses, while 51% of the cost would be 
for controls on cars and other vehicles that use roads and 13% for vehicles 
such as airliners and farm equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 By far, the single biggest expense -- $1.5 billion per year -- would come out 
of the pockets of consumers for public transportation improvements, including 
enhanced rail and bus service, car-pool lanes and freeway maintenance. Those 
congestion-relief projects already have been authorized by transportation 
agencies, so they could be implemented regardless of the outcome of the AQMD's 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Substantial expenses could also be paid by the construction industry -- an 
estimated $99.5 million annually -- and by the passenger transit industry -- 
$61 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic analysis shows the total annual cost, when adjusted for 
inflation, would be about $60 million less than the plan adopted in 1991. But 
the job loss would be worse -- by 5,000 positions per year -- largely because 
improved forecasting techniques were used, Lieu said. 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD officials, however, contend they have not factored in savings for local 
businesses from expanding the agency's "smog market," which allows buying and 
selling of pollution credits. The region's major oil, aerospace and other 
manufacturing industries consider the trading market less onerous and costly 
than traditional smog-control rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "The '94 plan is designed for the dual goal of clean air and a healthy 
economy," Wallerstein said. "The fact that we haven't received a lot of 
negative comments to date about this plan is reflective of the flexibility and 
new types of initiatives in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, the plan would buy a 5% decrease in all smog-causing pollutants in 
the four counties, with 75% eliminated by 2010. Under that scenario, the entire 
Los Angeles Basin then would meet all health standards for air pollution as 
required by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Remy acknowledged that the basin still has a long way to go to clean up its 
smog, but said "it has got to be done somewhat within the realm of economic 
reality" or ultimately the state's tax base and such services as education will 
suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the overall job loss, some industries would gain jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Complying with new smog rules would generate around 38,000 new jobs in the 
basin, but eliminate 101,201 other potential new ones -- a net loss of 63,049, 
according to the report. In comparison, the Southland lost about 475,000 jobs 
to the recession between 1990 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The report predicts the major job losers will be the health care industry, 
since there would be fewer pollution-related illnesses such as asthma, and 
retail services, since consumers would have less to spend. 
</P>
<P>
 A beneficiary, Wallerstein said, could be the hard-hit aerospace industry, 
which could shift to producing advanced transportation technologies such as 
electric cars. 
</P>
<P>
 But business leaders fear that some of the rules on interstate commerce -- 
such as a hotly debated fee on ships each time they dock and caps on airline 
pollution -- would leave the Los Angeles region unable to compete with other 
major commercial hubs. 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD economists, however, believe the impact on competitiveness would be 
minor. Exports and imports would be reduced by less than half of 1% annually, 
the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the cost estimate is tenuous because the cost of 60 of the plan's 106 
measures cannot be quantified yet and had to be roughly estimated at $3.4 
billion annually.

GUILTY PLEAS END S. COUNTY WATER SCANDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Closing out a scandal that prompted an overhaul of the Santa Margarita Water 
District, the district's former second-in-command pleaded guilty Thursday to 
criminal charges that he illegally influenced the award of contracts to 
companies that lavished him with gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 The guilty pleas by Michael P. Lord, the assistant general manager for nearly 
16 years until his retirement in 1993, end a criminal investigation that began 
at the district exactly 15 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord, who turned 51 last week, agreed to pay a $10,000 fine and perform 320 
hours of community service in exchange for pleading guilty to 15 counts of 
conflict of interest and failing to disclose gifts. Lord is in the midst of 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings, and was given until the end of the year to 
pay his fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing nervous and subdued in Municipal Court Thursday, Lord said he 
understood that he is not to be involved with any water district in Orange 
County, including Santa Margarita, for the next three years. He also agreed not 
to lobby on behalf of any county, state or local agency for the next four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just glad it's over," said Gary Pohlson, Lord's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord, whose bankruptcy filing in San Diego County claims assets of $375,646 
and liabilities of $416,257, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two weeks, three other officials have agreed to pay fines for 
similar conflicts of interest, and for their failure to fully disclose on their 
annual statements of economic interest, as state law requires, the gifts they 
had accepted from district contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter W. (Bill) Knitz, the former district general manager, pleaded guilty to 
23 criminal counts in exchange for paying a $20,000 fine and performing 200 
hours of community service. Former board chairman Don B. Schone and district 
engineer William B. Dye agreed to pay $10,000 each in civil fines to settle 
lawsuits filed against them by the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said the fines and community service were apt punishments for 
Knitz and Lord, although critics said the terms were far too lenient. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who I heard from wanted a little more flesh," said Bob Lay, a 
current board member. "But at least it's over. I'm glad that we got this whole 
thing behind us and we can move forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Kelly, the deputy district attorney who handled the cases against Santa 
Margarita officials, said that although Knitz and Lord spent grandly on 
themselves, there was no evidence of theft and felony charges could not be 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, these guys were able to stay at fine hotels and enjoy expensive meals 
and take a limo ride but . . . there was no evidence of theft," Kelly said. 
"The public is well served by the dispositions of these cases. These guys lived 
a high life and both have been disgraced." 
</P>
<P>
 In order to show that Knitz and Lord misappropriated public funds, Kelly said, 
prosecutors would have had to prove that both men engaged in "shocking and 
offensive behavior" in their spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have sympathy for those people (residing) in the water district, and the 
high water rates they have to pay, but we investigated this case thoroughly and 
could not meet the criminal burden needed to file felonies," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 The obscure South County water district has spent the past year in the news, 
following revelations in The Times that Knitz and Lord spent district money 
freely, often treating themselves and others to theater tickets, limousine 
rides, stays at posh hotels like the Ritz-Carlton and Helmsley Palace, as well 
as sheepskin seat covers and $125 wax jobs for their automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Knitz, Lord, Schone and Dye recommended or voted to award 
contracts to companies that gave them tens of thousands of dollars worth of 
gifts, such as hunting and fishing trips, meals, and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires that government officials who have accepted gifts totaling 
$250 or more in any 12-month period must abstain from doing anything to 
influence the award of a contract to a gift-giver in the succeeding year. 
Violations of the law are misdemeanors punishable by up to six months in jail 
and fines up to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the gifts came from two companies -- Robert Bein, William Frost & 
Associates of Irvine and MacDonald-Stephens Engineers of Mission Viejo -- that 
received the bulk of the district's engineering work. Together, they received 
$17 million worth of work between 1989 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the conflicts of interest, and the excessive spending by Knitz and Lord, 
were brought to light last year in a series of Times articles detailing how the 
two men had accepted more than $40,000 in gifts from companies doing business 
with the water district. In financial disclosure statements the men filed after 
the articles appeared, the two water officials acknowledged taking gifts worth 
about $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequent articles in The Times revealed that Schone and Dye had also been 
the beneficiaries of contractor largess, but the sums were much smaller and the 
reporting failures deemed less serious. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosures sparked intensive activity at the sleepy district, which had 
the same set of top managers for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 During 1993, Knitz and Lord retired. One board member resigned in disgust over 
the spending abuses and three others were voted out of office last November. 
Schone resigned in January, after The Times revealed he had taken free trips to 
Cabo San Lucas, courtesy of Bein-Frost. Even the board's longtime general 
counsel, Fritz R. Stradling, a founding member of the district, was fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Two laws were approved in the wake of the scandal. One, proposed by state 
Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) and signed into law by Gov. Pete Wilson, 
changed the way district board members were elected to a "one man, one vote" 
system. Previously, votes were awarded to property owners on the basis of one 
vote for each dollar of their property's value on property tax rolls -- a 
system that gave more political clout to the big landowner-developers in the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 The second law, proposed by state Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) and 
signed by Wilson in April, restricted gifts and honorariums to all officials of 
local governments or special districts. It also added tough new disclosure 
requirements for special districts, such as Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Special districts also underwent a new scrutiny following publicity about 
Santa Margarita's problems. In May, the Orange County Grand Jury recommended 
that nine water districts, including Santa Margarita, be merged into two larger 
districts for greater accountability. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita board member Lay said that if those elected to oversee special 
districts are not vigilant, there is always the potential for a new scandal 
somewhere down the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point in time, it will take a long time for future or current board 
members to forget what happened here," Lay said. "But if we're not paying 
attention, the same thing can happen again. And it can happen anywhere."

ABORTION CLINIC BUFFER AGAINST PROTEST UPHELD; SUPREME COURT: LIMITED BAN TO 
PRESERVE PATIENTS' RIGHTS DOES NOT VIOLATE FIRST AMENDMENT, JUSTICES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a victory for abortion rights advocates, the Supreme Court said Thursday 
that judges and lawmakers can create a "buffer zone" around an abortion clinic 
and prevent protesters from picketing and chanting on the street and sidewalks 
in front of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 This limited ban on peaceful protest does not violate the First Amendment's 
guarantee of freedom of speech, the court ruled on a 6-3 vote, as long as it is 
deemed necessary to preserve the patient's right to freely enter a clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Florida judge went too far, the court said, when he barred protesters 
from holding up photos of aborted fetuses and prohibited them from seeking to 
speak with any patient or staff member within 300 feet of a clinic in 
Melbourne, Fla. Those restrictions on free speech "sweep more broadly than 
necessary" to protect access to the clinic and therefore are unconstitutional, 
the justices said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was one of several announced on the last day of the high court's 
1993-94 term. In other rulings, the justices: 
</P>
<P>
 * Limited the 1965 Voting Rights Act by ruling that states need not create the 
maximum possible number of legislative seats for blacks and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 * Struck down a $52-million contempt fine assessed against the United Mine 
Workers and said such criminal-like punishments can only be imposed by a jury, 
not by a judge alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's opinion in the abortion protest case is likely to have a wide 
impact, not only on the continuing battle over abortion, but also on emerging 
areas of street protests, such as those by AIDS activists who have targeted 
Catholic church officials and by animal-rights advocates who have tried to shut 
medical research labs. 
</P>
<P>
 When faced with aggressive and persistent protesters, judges have been forced 
to draw a line dividing protected free speech from illegal harassment and 
interference with the rights of others. Thursday's ruling (Madsen vs. Women's 
Health Center, 93-880) marks the high court's first detailed pronouncement on 
the issue, which has arisen in scores of cases involving abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 The case arose from the long-running battle outside the Aware Woman Center in 
Melbourne, on the central Florida coast south of Cape Canaveral. The leaders of 
Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group, had pledged to shut the clinic 
through round-the-clock protests. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic's owner complained that her patients and staff suffered under "mob 
rule." But the abortion opponents said the First Amendment protected their 
right to picket, pray and chant on the street and the sidewalk next to the 
clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, faced with evidence that the protesters were continually impeding 
patients' right to enter the clinic, a state judge imposed a broad injunction. 
It created a 36-foot buffer zone outside the clinic's driveway. Police were 
told to arrest any protester who picketed, prayed or even walked in that area. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also barred loud chanting during surgical hours and prohibited the 
display of signs and photos that might upset patients. In addition, he said 
protesters must stay 300 feet from the homes of the clinic's patients and 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing for the court, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist upheld part of the 
injunction and struck down other parts. In doing so, he announced several 
important clarifications of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 First, a judge's order is not unconstitutional simply because it targets a 
particular group of protesters and restricts their free-speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
 An injunction "by its very nature" targets people who probably are attempting 
to convey a similar message, Rehnquist said. Abortion protesters were targeted 
at the Florida clinic, he said, not because of "their anti-abortion message 
(but) because they repeatedly violated" earlier court orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, injunctions can be upheld if they are no broader "than necessary to 
serve a significant governmental interest." In this case, officials had "a 
strong interest in protecting a woman's freedom to seek lawful medical and 
counseling services in connection with her pregnancy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, any person whose words or actions "could be interpreted as threats or 
veiled threats" is not protected from punishment under the First Amendment, 
Rehnquist declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Most states, including California, recently have enacted laws against 
"stalking." But some legal experts have questioned whether it is constitutional 
to make it a crime to follow someone or to harass them with unwanted comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Rehnquist's opinion suggests that anti-stalking laws can be upheld when there 
is evidence of threatening behavior. However, he also struck down part of the 
Melbourne injunction that protected clinic workers from being stalked or 
"shadowed" at all times and in all locations, calling this too broad an 
infringement on free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absent evidence that the protesters' speech . . . is infused with violence . 
. . or a threat of physical harm," it cannot be made illegal, the chief justice 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth, injunctions can restrict noise levels to protect the welfare of 
patients but cannot restrict signs and posters. "It is much easier for the 
clinic to pull up its curtains than for a patient to stop up her ears," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth, an injunction can ban "targeted residential picketing" directly in 
front of a doctor's home but it cannot go so far as to prohibit any picketing 
in the neighborhood. The Melbourne injunction went too far, he said, when it 
barred any protest activities within 300 feet of an employee's residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers said the ruling appears to clear up any constitutional doubts about 
the newly enacted federal law designed to protect access to abortion clinics. 
The law, signed by President Clinton in spring, makes it a federal crime to 
block access to a clinic or to intimidate women seeking abortions. The law 
already has been challenged on free-speech grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's ruling "is a slam-dunk win for women, doctors and health care 
workers," said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation, 
which helped defend the Melbourne clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nancy Skinner, a co-chair for Pro-Choice Orange County, says the decision 
is not a clear-cut victory for either side. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're obviously pleased that access will be improved," Skinner said. "But 
they can still show their ugly pictures and talk to women before they get to 
the free zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for anti-abortion protesters said the ruling has "devastating 
consequences for the pro-life movement." 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of today's Supreme Court opinion has transformed public sidewalks 
normally open for expressive activity into a type of Tian An Men Square," said 
Mat Staver, an Orlando, Fla., attorney who represented the three abortion 
protesters who had challenged the injunction. 
</P>
<P>
 In a vehement dissent, which he read from the bench, Justice Antonin Scalia 
accused his colleagues of making abortion protesters a "disfavored class" who 
were not accorded the same free-speech protections as labor picketers and civil 
rights protesters. Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas joined in 
Scalia's dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rehnquist and Scalia are usually linked as the conservative leaders 
of the high court, they have differed often on the First Amendment.  
</P>
<P>
 The chief justice usually sides with the government, regardless of the issue, 
but Scalia has often insisted on broad protection for free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, Scalia cast a key vote to strike down laws against 
flag-burning as a violation of free expression, while Rehnquist dissented 
strongly. Earlier this week, Rehnquist cast a key vote to uphold some 
regulation of cable television, while Scalia said he would strike down the 
rules as a violation of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling in the mine worker's case also involved a challenge to a judge's 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 9-0 decision, the justices put new limits on the power of judges to issue 
fines for contempt. Although judges can force an organization to pay for losses 
it has caused, they cannot punish someone without a jury trial, the court said 
in the case (International Union vs. Bagwell, 92-1625).

BRINGING TREES BACK TO BARED LANDS; ECOLOGY: A UCI SCIENTIST IS RISKING ALL 
HOPING TO SAVE FORESTS BY SHOWING COSTA RICA FARMERS THEY CAN RAISE HARDWOOD AS 
A CASH CROP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In the soggy mist of the nursery, Frances Lynn Carpenter's newborns lie 
content and still below a blanket of dusky topsoil. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of jade-colored seedlings sprout from a crib of wet earth, pushing 
forward delicate leaves like butterfly wings. Carpenter squats to the ground to 
finger the thin, tender shoot of a freshly germinated tropical tree. She 
admires its fullness. She pictures it fully grown. She dreams of seeds rising 
up and saving the world -- in a tall way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the people here feel sorry for me because I don't have any children," 
said Carpenter, a 50-year-old ecology professor from UC Irvine. "They don't 
understand a gringa who doesn't have babies. But I do -- I have 6,000 babies." 
</P>
<P>
 Some baffled friends call her the "wanna-be Johnny Appleseed" of the tropics, 
a seasoned scientist who risked academic prestige, personal savings and every 
last dollar of her credit card limits for a quixotic project to raise a rain 
forest from the battered, grassy slopes of southwest Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
 With a $20,000 gift and the mud-stained, blistered hands of California 
volunteers, Carpenter is carving a tropical tree finca, or farm, along hills 
beneath the mist-shrouded mountains of the southern frontier and overlooking 
the steel-blue ribbon of the Pacific and Golfo Dulce. 
</P>
<P>
 She is gambling the ranch that she can coax a rain forest so quickly, 
efficiently and economically that local farmers -- campesinos -- will imitate 
her, investing in trees and reaping a cash crop of hardwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Her aim is to stave off further destruction of rain forests, which have been 
chain-sawed and left rotting in the hills of Coto Brus to clear land for cattle 
pastures and coffee plantations. 
</P>
<P>
 Rufous-tailed hawks and wild parakeets sail the cool breeze above her farm -- 
63 acres of steep, emerald green hills that have been burned by fire, shaved by 
herbicide, washed by relentless rain, crushed by the heavy hoofs of cattle and 
now planted with 6,000 trees, with more on the way in the nursery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is exactly what I wanted," Carpenter said with a cheerful smile as 
relentless as the afternoon rainstorms. 
</P>
<P>
 Just four decades ago, the vast sweep of velvet green hills was covered 
completely with a canopy of lush tropical hardwoods so dense that the towering 
forest smothered the light for 20th-Century settlers who wandered here from 
northern Costa Rica, the United States and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 The first tree slain by an ax fell on Feb. 28, 1952, and in the years that 
followed, the giants came crashing down with such fury and intensity that some 
wistful residents called the shuddering land La Tierra Triste -- The Sad Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Rica has been losing its forest more rapidly than other ecologically 
rich countries even though the nation has been widely praised for its extensive 
network of forest preserves. At the start of the century, more than 85% of the 
small, Central American country was covered with forest, but that figure has 
fallen to less than 50%. Some local economists pessimistically estimate that 
unprotected forests -- which are not located in the country's national 
preserves -- will vanish at the rate of 98,000 acres a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from the thunder clap of dead trees, Carpenter had been preoccupied for 
much of the last 22 years with the foraging patterns of Hawaiian honeycreepers, 
or the pitched battle for nectar waged by insects and hummingbirds. 
</P>
<P>
 Her UCI research focused on the torpor of the Andean hummingbird and the 
feeding territory of migrant hummingbirds. She was fascinated by the wild, 
furious creatures with beating hearts so huge they consume life at a fever 
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "They live life on the edge," she said of the birds she was so taken with. 
"They're always in danger of using up their energy reserves. They have to 
interact intensely with their environment." 
</P>
<P>
 But Carpenter keenly missed that intensity in her own life. She was restless 
in class, daydreaming about retirement that was years away. And as she careened 
toward her 50th year, she took stock of herself and assumed a peculiarly modern 
burden. 
</P>
<P>
 "I began to realize that my life was going to be my career," she said of her 
decision to shift specialties. "I was not going to get remarried and have a 
family, and I accepted that." 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, the trembling, iridescent hummingbirds no longer seemed so 
intriguing. While on sabbatical in 1991, she participated in a deforestation 
seminar in Costa Rica. She left the lecture steaming and outraged because no 
one seemed to offer a solution to the relentless problem. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when the seed of an idea took hold: Why couldn't The Sad Earth be 
healed? Carpenter started biting her nails again, tossing at night with dreams 
about her life's work. She received encouragement from her mother and father, 
who gave her a gift of $20,000 to purchase property for a tree experiment in 
Costa Rica. Still she couldn't decide. She feared her UCI colleagues might be 
scornful of a practical project with a lab of deep red mud and washed-out 
cattle trails. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came her father's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does it really matter whether hummingbirds define their territory or not?" 
Carpenter asked. "I had never before taken on something that really mattered 
because of a fear of failure. If I failed with the hummingbirds, it didn't 
really matter. But the trees really mattered." Disgust at First Sight 
</P>
<P>
 This June, when the steamy rain of Coto Brus began thrashing the hills, 
Carpenter returned to her 6,000 young trees rising from the gentle slopes known 
as Camp Two and a Half. 
</P>
<P>
 She first glimpsed the land in 1991 while on a seven-month sabbatical to 
southern Costa Rica to research the effect of exotic plants on native trees in 
a rain forest preserve. She was seated in a rumbling bus bound for the Pacific 
beach when she saw her future farm. It was disgust at first sight. 
</P>
<P>
 From her window seat, she was struck by the eroded pastures, snapping a 
photograph of the bleak hills. The steep slopes, etched with a network of 
cattle trails, were losing black topsoil to a murky lagoon at the bottom of a 
huge, grassy bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 So exhausted was the clayish, rust-colored soil that local farmers deemed it 
unfit for agricultural use. No tractor could tackle its rutted slopes. Chemical 
herbicides had ruined an old crop of coffee plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, her photo of the damaged hills would become Exhibit A in her passionate 
lectures on deforestation to ecology undergraduates at UCI. There was something 
about the forlorn hills that touched her students like the whisper of 
hummingbird wings never could. 
</P>
<P>
 She bought the farm for $20,000 in August, 1992, a move that gave her new 
passion for teaching undergraduate and graduate ecology students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was getting fed up with my job until I got the farm," said Carpenter, who 
divides the year equally between teaching and her Costa Rica research. "My 
heart wasn't in my work. I love to teach now. It's given me some kind of heart 
and compassion for my students that I didn't have before." 
</P>
<P>
 After one lecture that featured her project she received a standing ovation. 
Volunteers started trickling to Costa Rica for the unglamorous tasks of 
counting and measuring trees and watching them grow. Some special expeditions 
paid as much as $2,000 to make the odyssey to her farm and the neighboring rain 
forest preserve of mystery and darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 At a supermarket checkout stand in California, a San Diego couple overheard a 
conversation about Carpenter's project. It was enough to inspire them 
eventually to buy plane tickets to join the professor in south Costa Rica. A 
Newport Beach accountant also headed south after reading about the project. 
</P>
<P>
 They were drawn by a charismatic guide, who in many ways is an ebullient Peter 
Pan -- particularly when dangling by rope from the sturdy branches of a 
150-foot-tall amarillon tree. 
</P>
<P>
 A cocked olive hat covers Carpenter's cropped brown hair. Her eyes are the 
color of tree bark. Slim and lithe, she is dressed in lavender from her 
delicate amethyst earrings to socks thick enough to unsettle chiggers. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the woods, people trail her even as she blasts along muddy, unpaved 
roads at the wheel of a lurching four-wheel-drive vehicle, red earth spraying 
from the tires while howler monkeys scream from hidden retreats in the tree 
canopy. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's single and she calls the trees her kids, and they are in a way," said 
Eric Pianka, 55, a volunteer and herpetologist from the University of Texas who 
followed Carpenter to Costa Rica to build a carport for her farm station. "It's 
kind of nuts. It sounds like a crazy project to me. And if it wasn't Lynn I 
would probably say she's a lunatic. I hope it works." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter said she thinks that volunteers are attracted to her farm because 
her solutions seem straightforward and practical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the appeal is the same for me," said Carpenter. "Once you hear the 
core ideas about my project it just makes so much sense. You feel like your 
effort is making a difference. It scares me to think of failing at this; it's 
the fear that drives me. I think of all the work we've done and I just know we 
can make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Her goals are summed up in her pleas for six-figure foundation grants, which 
have yet to flow like the volunteers: Find native trees that thrive on hardship 
and ravaged soil. Develop a recipe of mulches and clippings, vegetation and 
leguminous trees that can nourish the earth and speed growth. Move out of the 
way when the trees start growing. 
</P>
<P>
 That sounds deceptively simple. But most forestry experiments last about five 
to 10 years while Carpenter estimates her experiment will take place over 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 She has also chosen to nurture trees on nutrient-poor earth -- in contrast to 
most forestry experiments, which usually are conducted on rich soil for quick 
results. She argues that such results have little application for campesinos 
who are struggling to make damaged land productive. 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve her grander aims, Carpenter had to start with basics as rudimentary 
as social conversation. First, she had to brush up on her college Spanish, 
which she did with such relish that one local scientist marveled at her 
academic mastery of virtually all of the local, Tico vulgarities. 
</P>
<P>
 She also had to tackle subjects that she scorned during her university 
training: soil ecology, economics, sociology, forestry and political science. 
</P>
<P>
 With her broad American accent and open manner, she won over many of the 
farmers, who freely shared folklore about native trees with the fastest growing 
abilities and most marketable uses for construction or furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 They were in no hurry, though, to follow her example. A steady stream of 
visitors made a pilgrimage to her hillside station after hearing she had bought 
one of the most tired farms in the area. They simply wanted to sell her another 
finca . 
</P>
<P>
 "I am waiting 10 years to see what happens to her project," said Hernan 
Villalobos, a son of Costa Rican pioneers who helped to settle Coto Brus and a 
member of several local farming organizations looking for alternatives to 
traditional coffee plantations and cattle ranching. "This is really an 
adventure at this point. It seems to have promise, but the problem is, she has 
to demonstrate that it will pay for campesinos ." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was the campesinos who gave her the advice that prompted her to pick 
the amarillon tree to spawn a forest of seedlings. A tropical hardwood of rich, 
mustard-and-red grain, the colorful wood was used for the double doors to her 
new Costa Rican home. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the task of plucking fresh amarillon seeds was assigned to her 
workers and volunteers who literally hugged trees and scaled trunks in a quest 
for robust mother trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter took a shopping list of mountain-climbing equipment to California 
and purchased $1,500 worth of webbing, ropes and harnesses. Then a savvy 
volunteer adapted the equipment to reach the towering canopies of amarillon and 
mayo colorado trees. 
</P>
<P>
 They could have plucked seeds scattered below the tree trunks, but Carpenter 
insisted they had to come from newly cut branches to avoid fungus and rot that 
weakens seeds on the ground. She wanted to know the full history of the mother 
trees so she could track the strongest, healthiest stock for her seedlings. 
</P>
<P>
 And so a giant rubber slingshot was fashioned to send a heavy rope and a 
five-pound fishing line sinker sailing over the tops of the mottled, 
white-and-and gray branches of the amarillon. Then the volunteers climbed up, 
entering a new dimension of treetop life where the branches swarmed with 
beetles, butterflies and birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Devon Biggs, a Wisconsin volunteer, and Carpenter's Costa Rican foreman, 
Eduver Sandi, learned to hoist themselves up 150 feet with ropes and carabiners 
meant for mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really an emotional feeling up there because you know your life could be 
on the ground, " said Sandi, 30, who on one foray for pristine seeds was 
attacked by bees that swarmed over his face, ears and mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Carpenter stayed on the ground while others embraced the trees. 
Then this summer, she insisted on a climbing lesson, weighing the consequences 
of the ascent much as she mulled her decision to switch careers. 
</P>
<P>
 While her volunteers watched, she dangled from an amarillon tree like a 
spider, inching with the same deliberate speed until her hiking boots thrashed 
four feet above ground. Somebody whistled a James Bond theme song for 
encouragement. She paused in midair, measuring the growing separation from the 
earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest part is switching from climbing up to coming down," said 
Carpenter. "I don't feel stable at that point. I feel basically that I know 
what I have to do, but I get nervous and weak when I think about what could 
happen. I really, really want to be able to get up there." Investing Herself 
</P>
<P>
 In the morning, before the afternoon mist drapes the mountains and rain pelts 
the slopes with stinging torrents of water, Carpenter slides on mud-caked 
rubber boots to head for her nursery. 
</P>
<P>
 The green wings of tiny seedlings make a thick, emerald carpet along the 
narrow beds of topsoil. Soon it will be their turn to sink roots in the hills 
where 6,000 trees are already flourishing, some of them reaching above 
Carpenter's knee. 
</P>
<P>
 It is quiet moments like these that Carpenter relishes like a favorite 
photograph in a family album. She doesn't dwell on the times when she is 
worrying about money because she has charged her credit cards to the maximum to 
furnish her new farm station with a stove and refrigerator. She doesn't worry 
that she hasn't yet tapped sizable foundation grants to underwrite her grand 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow scientist Marta E. Rosemeyer, a University of Costa Rica researcher, 
said she believes that Carpenter has been able to plod along on a shoestring 
budget subsidized by volunteers because the UCI professor has invested so much 
of herself in the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most scientists don't do this kind of thing," said Rosemeyer. "She's put a 
tremendous amount of her savings into this. What's that old expression? Where 
your treasures are, that's where your heart is." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter takes heart in her seeds. Raising a Rain Forest 
</P>
<P>
 UCI Prof. Frances Lynn Carpenter has carved out a tree farm on 63 barren acres 
in the hilly country of Costa Rica, where she is launching a 20-year experiment 
to raise a rain forest on degraded and damaged pasture land. Profile: Frances

A SEARING FOCUS ON PONDEROUS PROCEEDINGS

<P>
 Hundreds of reporters, scores of hours of video, thousands of words expended 
to convey the tedium and the lunacy of Thursday in Los Angeles -- with all 
this, the mood of the day was best captured by the behavior of a copy machine 
in the fifth-floor county clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning out document replicas to satisfy all the reporters who wanted them, it 
simply overloaded and stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a day so crazy that O.J. Simpson's lawyer-friends Robert Kardashian and 
Leroy Taft, pursued into the street by reporters, took a bus -- a bus! -- to a 
Downtown restaurant for lunch and hitched a ride back to court in a police car. 
And it was a day so routine that in cars mired in dense traffic a mere block 
from the courthouse, radios were blaring everything but O.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The first day of O.J. Simpson's preliminary hearing could fit any place in 
L.A.'s kaleidoscope. 
</P>
<P>
 Variety would call it a plodding legal sequel that couldn't hold the audience, 
compared to the original blockbuster, the slow-mo twilight freeway chase of two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech could plot the course of Thursday's newsquake, from the courtroom 
epicenter, across town, across the country, to a Northridge restaurant where 
bartender Alex Lunardon fulminated that "every channel that I've turned to has 
it on." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what, he said, "at 4:30 I'm definitely showing the soccer match. I'm 
Argentine." 
</P>
<P>
 The trial was everywhere. In a gym in Long Beach, people stayed aboard the 
Stairmasters so they could watch TV. In a Chicago bar at noontime no one 
wondered who he was when the waitress asked, "Do you think he did it?" And in 
the Peachtree Street Macy's in Atlanta, of the 66 color TVs in the electronics 
department, all but two were tuned to CNN and Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 The radio shrinks could say that we have had it up to here with O.J. . . . or 
that we're so hungry for every scrap about the case that the Boston Globe can 
trill on for a dozen rapt paragraphs about the prosecutor's "head of tight 
curls" and the defense attorney's "deep, deep tan." 
</P>
<P>
 But even if some are bored and tired and generally disgusted with the whole 
O.J. spectacle, that isn't likely to interfere with the pursuit of the bottom 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Canoga Park Bowl, Priscilla Simone of Woodland Hills remembered that 
she doubled her usual bartender's income as patrons glued to her television set 
stayed and drank during the arrest of O.J. two weeks ago. "If it were you or I, 
I wouldn't have made that much money and they wouldn't have sold all them 
newspapers," she said. "It's a celebrity everyone's gaining off of." 
</P>
<P>
 The day, frame by frame: 
</P>
<P>
 At 7:30 a.m., an hour when even the homeless have just begun to stir on 
Downtown streets, Nicole Brown Simpson's sisters, parents and friends were 
sitting in the back booth of a scruffy Downtown coffee shop, waiting to attend 
the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing, which had gotten as much buildup as the opening of a new Steven 
Spielberg movie, began with promising drama, when the helicopters hovered into 
sound and view at 8:40 a.m., tracking the police van bringing Simpson to court. 
(Unlike what one young man assured another on a Downtown street, there is no 
tunnel from the jail to the courthouse.) 
</P>
<P>
 The courtroom pace moved ponderously, disappointing many who had expected 
incendiary TV-movie lawyering. But not everyone was disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 At Jefferson Boulevard and Crenshaw Avenue, where "Pray for O.J." T-shirts 
rippled like flags in the late June wind, Jay Akeem paid $10 for an extra-large 
and said: "We grew up on 'Perry Mason' and 'Matlock'. . . . It's tedious going 
through the proceedings though. I was watching this morning, the forensics, the 
LAPD woman -- (it was) getting real technical, but it's important." 
</P>
<P>
 With only 80 seats in the courtroom, news stations and the curious found more 
engrossing events out on the courthouse sidewalks. See-saw debates went on 
between Simpson supporters and people such as Jewish Defense League leader Irv 
Rubin, who demanded via bullhorn that defense attorney Robert L. Shapiro not 
forget his "Jewish brother, Ronald Goldman," one of the victims. Perennial 
candidate Melrose Larry Green told a Simpson supporter, "Stand up and smell the 
bagels!" 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, artist Rodney Vanworth created an instant mural when he spread a 
6-foot canvas on the sidewalk and invited people to write on it with markers. 
He had already drawn the figure of a red-smeared woman with knives sticking out 
of her body, a shoe, a jail cell, a sink and a toilet and a trophy with the 
words "hero" and "pity the victims" written on it. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brentwood, as police searched an empty lot for more evidence, it was like 
old times -- two weeks ago -- when it was the center of the action. 
</P>
<P>
 A deliveryman from A Votre Sante restaurant, who had fed the media mob back 
then, lost no time in returning Thursday and passing out menus for fare like 
whole wheat chapatis filled with hummus. "This is Brentwood," said Sean 
McFarland. "Nobody eats anything with fat in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce has been part of big legal cases since fast-buck artists sold toy 
monkeys on the sidewalks outside the Scopes evolution trial in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courthouse, shirt-seller K.T. had virtually cleared out all 20 
dozen shirts -- "Don't Squeeze the Juice" and "Pray for O.J." -- in two days. 
One woman fingered a shirt, sniffed and said to K.T., "Do you have any with the 
opposite point of view, like 'Fry O.J.'?" 
</P>
<P>
 City Hall sidewalks served as little more than a parking lot for TV vans -- 
and they all got parking tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 In one city councilman's office, the receptionist admitted that "there's a TV 
in back that no one's supposed to know about." Mayor Richard Riordan's aides 
held their breath lest their boss be bumped yet again from an oft-delayed 
morning news appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 And standing with the smokers on the west steps, Vivian Sarpong complained 
that she had gone to a drugstore Thursday morning to buy "one of those little 
TVs, and they were all sold out!" She will buy one this weekend. At her desk, 
she prepared "a little spot for my TV. Got a little piece of cardboard in case 
anybody comes by, I can flop it down, cover it up." 
</P>
<P>
 If people watched or listened at work, most tried to do so unobtrusively. 
</P>
<P>
 On the floor of a huge Downtown bank, a woman at a desk murmured that there 
was a TV around somewhere, but "the bank doesn't pay me for that, 
unfortunately." 
</P>
<P>
 "People are forced to watch it, if they want to watch television," said a 
frustrated Cheryl Williams of Woodland Hills, who saw the proceedings at Lee's 
Natural Nails in Tarzana while waiting for her French manicure to dry. 
</P>
<P>
 Manicurist Chau Hoang was envious because only customers at the salon face the 
TV set while those doing the polishing have their backs to the screen. "We 
wanted to see it, but we were busy." she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And at Mezzaluna, the bright, prow-shaped Brentwood restaurant where Nicole 
Simpson last ate and Goldman last worked, waiters sliding the luncheon specials 
into the menus looked up at the television suspended from the cloud-painted 
ceiling, and murmured about the day's legal doings in overheard snips like 
"special circumstances" and "and then he walks." 
</P>
<P>
 The start of the hearing coincided with lunch hour in much of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In the back room of Mother Hubbard's in Chicago, claims adjuster Alona Sanders 
got to monitor the case at work the first day -- but today is another matter. 
"They came in and told us today that as of tomorrow, they were cutting off the 
radios during work hours," Sanders said. "They think it's interfering with our 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Los Angeles, only a handful of customers were sitting in the bar at 
Chili's Grill & Bar in Northridge as the proceedings resumed after a two-hour 
lunch break. And they were wearing down. "I'm looking for a break from all this 
O.J. stuff," said Carmelita Robins(CQ) of Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one moment seemed to vary from the script.  
</P>
<P>
 A tall man in a suit walked into the heavily secured court wearing one of the 
rare, coveted white badges identifying him as a member of the defense or 
prosecution team. He said he was "a good friend of O.J.'s and Shapiro's." 
</P>
<P>
 When deputies asked Shapiro about that, the defense attorney said: "I've never 
seen him in my life," and the man was hustled out. Contributing to this story

A RICH RETURN ON HER HONESTY; REWARD: HOMELESS WOMAN WHO FINDS $25,000 CHECK 
GIVES IT BACK. 'I FEEL BETTER AND THAT'S THAT,' SAYS MARLENE DALLUGGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For a homeless woman forced to learn the brutal lessons of life on the 
streets, it was simply the right thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Marlene Dallugge returned a check for $25,000 she had found while 
scouring the streets for what she called "collectibles."It was a small act of 
honesty that brought her a $100 reward and a lot of satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is hard to find a $25,000 check on the sidewalk and give it up," said a 
grateful Henry Spitzer, president of Topco Inc., the payee on the check. "It is 
like winning the Lotto for someone like her and being just one number off." 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel better and that's that," Dallugge said after returning the check. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallugge, who said she is a former trapeze artist, has been down on her luck 
since the Northridge earthquake. She was living in a Woodland Hills home owned 
by her father, but was forced to leave when the badly damaged house was 
demolished, she said. After renting a string of rooms, Dallugge said she began 
living out of her car about a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never found anything of this amount," she told Spitzer. "Six or seven 
people walked past it before I picked it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Dallugge said she never even thought of trying to cash the check, on which 
payment had been stopped the day it was lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has lived here her whole life and there are so many people like her in 
the Valley who are having a difficult time," Spitzer said after meeting her in 
a diner. "I see them everyday." 
</P>
<P>
 Dallugge's only request of Spitzer was for a photocopy of the check. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to show my dad, he will be so proud," she said.

GROUP FORMS TO LOBBY FOR QUAKE VICTIMS; RELIEF: THE COALITION ASSAILS INSURERS' 
DUAL-PAYEE CHECKS, WHICH GIVE BANKS CONTROL OVER PAYMENTS TO POLICYHOLDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL BETTNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A newly formed coalition of quake-battered San Fernando Valley residents and 
business owners plans to take on insurance companies, lenders and others it 
believes continue to mistreat victims of January's Northridge temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit group is calling itself Citizens Against Unfair Treatment by 
Insurance and Mortgage Companies (CAUTIM). 
</P>
<P>
 Board members include 16 representatives of area property owner associations 
and business organizations, said Sandy Miller, CAUTIM chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Collectively, they probably represent a good 40,000 to 50,000 people who have 
problems related to the earthquake involving insurance companies and lenders," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition is also made up of representatives of other consumer groups that 
have been active in the nearly six months since the quake. They include United 
Policyholders, an Oakland-based nonprofit organization, and a new local group, 
Community Assistance Recovery (CARe), based in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, an Encino resident, is also chief of staff for Sen. David A. Roberti 
(D-Van Nuys). Miller stressed that Roberti is not connected with the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the new consumer coalition are particularly angry at insurers that 
are issuing settlement checks payable to both policyholders and to their 
lenders. Some lenders are putting all or part of the money in escrow until 
repairs are made. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had this particular problem myself," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. and a CAUTIM 
organizer, said the group plans to file a lawsuit against insurers and lenders 
to recover an unspecified amount of damages by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Many quake victims have complained about the controversial practice of issuing 
dual-payee checks. They contend that lenders have no right to control the money 
if they didn't require borrowers to carry earthquake coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Most lenders insist that mortgagees carry fire insurance, but don't require 
them to have earthquake insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the Northridge quake, Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi said he 
would bar insurance companies from issuing the dual-payee checks.

 Garamendi later changed his mind, citing a conflict between state insurance 
law and banking law on the issue. The insurance commissioner said he feared 
insurers might decide not to make any payments to quake victims until the issue 
was resolved in court.

ON THEIR OWN TERMS; VALLEY-AREA CONGRESSMEN FROSTY TO STATE-MANDATED LIMITS ON 
TENURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As a first-time congressional candidate two years ago, Rep. Howard P. (Buck) 
McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) lined up with voters who were unhappy with long-term 
incumbents by backing a state ballot measure to limit terms in the House of 
Representatives to six years. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, well into his first term, McKeon maintains that Californians made a 
mistake by approving Proposition 164. Rather, after learning the legislative 
ropes in all their knotty complexity as a freshman lawmaker, he says, he would 
prefer to see a national cap of 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 And McKeon's San Fernando Valley-area colleagues, all veteran lawmakers, voice 
even less support for term limits -- which, not surprisingly, are a bigger hit 
with voters than with those whose careers they seek to cap. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the announcement that the U.S. Supreme Court will decide 
whether states can impose term limits on members of Congress, each of the five 
lawmakers expressed opposition to such action by individual states. McKeon 
aside, the other four have represented Southern California in the nation's 
capital for a total of 72 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "People really ought to have a right to choose whom they want," said Rep. 
Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), who is seeking a 10th two-year term. 
"We already have limits. Many of us are involved in close and difficult and 
expensive reelection campaigns now, as we have been all our lives. People have 
an opportunity every two years to pass judgment on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson and fellow Democrats Howard L. Berman of Panorama City and Henry A. 
Waxman of Los Angeles said they have become better representatives over time, 
particularly in terms of handling complicated national intelligence, foreign 
policy and environmental issues. Term limits would rob Congress of its 
accumulated wisdom and institutional memory, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
 On the fence is Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead of Glendale, the dean of the 
California Republican delegation, who was first elected to the House when 
Richard M. Nixon was reelected to the White House in 1972. Were term limits 
adopted, Moorhead said he would prefer uniform, nationwide restrictions through 
a constitutional amendment rather than state-by-state caps. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Term limits on a national basis could make some sense," Moorhead said. "If 
one state alone does it, it gets left out of the leadership and committee 
chairmanships and ranking positions in the end, especially if the terms are 
relatively short." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead knows whereof he speaks. He became the senior Republican on the 
prestigious Energy and Commerce Committee last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court will hear an appeal of a decision by the Arkansas Supreme 
Court. That court ruled in March that a term-limits amendment approved by the 
state's voters in a 1992 referendum violated the Constitution, which stipulates 
the qualifications for federal lawmakers. The case will be argued this fall and 
is expected to be decided next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 California voters, like those in Arkansas, approved an initiative that 
restricts House members to six consecutive years and U.S. senators to two 
six-year terms. If the measure is upheld by the court, House members first 
elected in 1992 or before could not hold office after 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve other states besides California and Arkansas have placed restrictions 
on the number of terms that members of their congressional delegations can 
serve. The Arkansas appeal was the first to reach the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Valley lawmakers said they would not be surprised if the court rules 
that states do not have the right to limit congressional terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a pretty good argument that term limits, as applied to Congress on a 
state-by-state basis, constitute an impermissible effort to set a qualification 
for office in violation of the Constitution," said Berman, who declared that 
he'd be "a hypocrite" not to oppose such restrictions as he asks voters to 
reelect him to a sixth term. 
</P>
<P>
 The Constitution requires only that a member of Congress be 25 years of age, a 
citizen of the United States for seven years and an inhabitant of the state 
from which he is elected. Waxman said that capping lawmakers' tenure will have 
an unintended consequence: "It will give greater power to lobbyists, to special 
interests and to the permanent staff." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Valley lawmakers say that California has much to lose in leadership 
positions and committee chairmanships if the court upholds term limits imposed 
by individual states. 
</P>
<P>
 Their own circumstances support this contention. In addition to Moorhead's 
position, Beilenson will be the next Democrat in line to become chairman of the 
powerful Rules Committee if he's reelected. Berman is chairman of the Foreign 
Affairs subcommittee on international operations, which oversees the State 
Department's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 And Waxman is the longtime chairman of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on 
health and environment, which has a sweeping jurisdiction that has helped him 
play a key role on health care, clean air, tobacco, food and drug safety, 
medical devices and numerous other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The four veteran Valley lawmakers are the epitome of career politicians. All 
are lawyers who served in the state Legislature before coming to Congress. 
Waxman and Berman first met at UCLA when they worked on Adlai Stevenson's 
presidential campaign in the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon is an exception. A successful businessman, he entered politics as a 
school board trustee and later as Santa Clarita's first mayor and never served 
as a state legislator before winning election to Congress in 1992, on his first 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran on a government-reform platform and has continued to advocate the cause 
as president of the Republican freshman class. Nevertheless, he has determined 
that "six years is a little short, though for myself it may be adequate. It 
takes the first term almost to get to know people and know your way around and 
how the process works." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon said that he'd like to see House members limited to three four-year 
terms to ease the constant pressure to raise campaign funds and scramble for 
reelection every other year. But, he said, "the only way for term limits to 
really work is to be even across the country." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon acknowledged that he has had second thoughts about any restrictions at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would lose some great people, who never lose their enthusiasm, never lose 
their work ethic," he said. On the other hand, he added, "there are some people 
who get so entrenched that there is no way to get rid of them without term 
limits." 
</P>
<P>
 He cited Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), the powerful chairman of the Senate 
Appropriations Committee, whose predilection and ability to steer pork-barrel 
projects to his home state are legendary. "The people of West Virginia would be 
crazy to vote him out," McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita freshman said he has a particular problem with the term 
limits proposition passed by California voters in 1992, because it amounts to 
unilateral disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon said he "didn't understand when I first signed on" how it would just 
affect California and other states that passed similar restrictions. "I would 
not like to see it done that way. There's no reason why you would cut off your 
nose to spite your face." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, McKeon refused to commit himself to a personal congressional 
end-point. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people elect me, I would plan to serve eight to 10 years," he said. "It's 
not in concrete. I just don't want to be here that long." Legislative Veterans

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: DESPERATELY SEEKING A GIG AS MADONNA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Many swore they've never been Madonna wanna-bes. 
</P>
<P>
 But about 250 hopefuls dressed like the sensational, foul-mouthed pop singer 
waited in line outside a Burbank casting agency Thursday for the opportunity of 
a lifetime: playing Madonna in a two-hour television movie about her early 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 Several television and newspaper reporters were on hand, giving the aspiring 
actresses a taste of what being a celebrity is all about at the open casting 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not used to all this media, but I'm getting used to it," said Andrea 
Schurgin, 24, of Burbank, who brought her own microphone and a pair of backup 
singers, Naomi and Alyssa. 
</P>
<P>
 The three friends spent $50 for matching stockings, hair ribbons and rubber 
bracelets like the ones Madonna wore in her "Lucky Star" video. They practiced 
lip-syncing and twirling for three hours in front of a living room mirror 
Wednesday night. Others, such as Denise Vlasis of Sherman Oaks, came with 
considerably more experience. She's a professional Madonna impersonator earning 
upwards of $200 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the Katy & Co. casting agency, the hopefuls performed 30-second dance 
routines and read from a script in front of a casting director and producers of 
"Madonna: The Early Years." 
</P>
<P>
 The film is set to begin shooting this month and will air on the Fox network 
in the fall. It chronicles Madonna Ciccone's life as a struggling artist in 
1978 to the success of her "Like a Virgin" album in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 "It opens with a girl from Detroit who came to New York with $37 and was so 
broke she was eating out of garbage cans and squatting in abandoned buildings," 
said Michael Murray, the movie's scriptwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The early part of her career is the least examined and, in some ways, the 
most interesting. She was a street urchin who turned herself into a superstar." 
</P>
<P>
 "Acting is the most essential thing because it's a two-hour movie," said 
casting director Katy Wallin. "Even if Madonna isn't the best actress, we 
obviously want to cast someone who is qualified." VIVIEN LOU CHEN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: EXTENDING LIFE OF DUMP TO BE STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Board of Public Works on Thursday instructed sanitation 
officials to take the first steps in drafting an environmental study on a 
proposal to extend the life of the Lopez Canyon Landfill near Lake View 
Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 But to leave open the option of closing the landfill when its permit expires 
in 1996, the panel also instructed sanitation officials to begin seeking bids 
for alternative trash disposal services. 
</P>
<P>
 The action is the latest development in a heated debate over whether to extend 
the dump's operating permit until 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 A city Bureau of Sanitation report released in March suggested that if the 
city extends the life of the landfill, it can save $72 million over the cost of 
hauling the city's waste to other local dumps. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Lake View Terrace residents and Councilman Richard Alarcon, whose 
district includes the landfill, adamantly opposed the extension, saying 
residents had been promised there would be no extensions. HUGO MARTIN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; KINDERGARTEN CLASSES TOO BIG, TEACHERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two dozen kindergarten teachers urged the Anaheim City School District this 
week to change a new district policy that will force teachers to supervise up 
to 65 children. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers told the school board Tuesday night that two teachers together 
watching over as many as 65 5-year-olds will cause confusion and cut into 
valuable classroom time.Teachers said they would lose the equivalent of four 
weeks of instruction a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The change also might pose safety risks, teachers said. With so many students, 
teachers said they would have difficulty evacuating a classroom in case of an 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 To accommodate bus schedules, administrators said, kindergarten classes have 
to be combined for 20 minutes each school day. The busing timetables were 
revised this year to cope with the district's growing student population, 
administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators say that with so many activities available for the children 
such as the library, recess or lunch, teachers would rarely have to seat two 
classes together, Deputy Supt. Mary Ellen Blanton said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 80 kindergarten teachers and about 2,500 students are affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanton said the administration will seek a compromise with the teachers.

<P>
 Sipping on a Budweiser at a friend's home early Wednesday evening, Eric 
Reinhart was priming to party this Fourth of July. So were a few of his friends 
who live in the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 One friend, Rob, who asked that his last name not be used, plans to hold a big 
Independence Day bash complete with a live band and kegs of beer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to rage on," said Rob, 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Roommate Pam Shader, 24, added: "The whole street is a party." 
</P>
<P>
 Locals said they plan to have parties despite a new city ordinance that clamps 
down on large, loud and disruptive gatherings. The ordinance states that if 
police make a second response to a large party or event on private property 
within 30 days, the owner, renter or party organizer can be fined up to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The law was necessary because the parties are a drain on police staffing and 
resources and leave other areas of the city without police protection, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens is a group of young people rent an apartment or cottage, then it 
becomes a party house and lots of people come and go and they create problems," 
said Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinhart, 26, said the law's penalty is too stiff but, "I think it will make 
people aware and calm down." 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenberg said his department has identified areas downtown where there might 
be trouble this holiday weekend and houses where people are likely to have big 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
 These areas include the area of 7th Street and Olive Avenue -- the scene of a 
party last Fourth of July that raged out of control as hundreds of people 
helped burn a bonfire of lawn furniture and sofas. Police in riot gear broke up 
the large crowd. Other targeted party areas are 8th Street and Pecan Avenue and 
11th Street and Orange Avenue, Lowenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents said that the people who create the problems are usually from 
out of town and that many people who live downtown host responsible parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants to have fun, but there's a limit to going overboard," said 
Dave Alldredge, 28, who also lives downtown. "It's usually the people who don't 
live here that come down here and make the trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Christi Wensevic, 23, who lives on 7th Street, said she is nervous about 
parties getting out of control this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, it was crazy. I was scared," she said. Vandals smashed car windows 
and dented doors, she said. Wensevic plans to take her car to her parents' home 
this year for safekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Her neighbor, Angie Smolinski, 29, also is hoping for a safe holiday and plans 
to have a few friends over for a quiet celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not looking forward to it," Smolinski said of the anticipated crowds. 
"I'm all for the police doing what they have to do."DEBRA CANO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HILLS; WOMAN EARNS MEDAL FOR HER SHOW OF METTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dorothy Nolt had just finished her paperwork -- halfway through her overnight 
shift on the switchboard -- when she took off her glasses and walked in her 
stocking feet into the next room for a cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when everything went flying, and everything went black," said Nolt, 
one of the minority of Los Angeles residents already awake when the Northridge 
earthquake struck at 4:31 a.m. Jan. 17.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week, her efforts during the earthquake earned Nolt, 60, an American 
Legion, Department of California, Medal of Honor. A switchboard operator at the 
Sepulveda Veterans Administration Hospital for 13 years, Nolt stayed on duty 
that morning despite broken glass, falling water and equipment crashing around 
her, providing information to other VA hospitals and clearing the way for the 
evacuation of the patients. 
</P>
<P>
 When the quake hit, Nolt was left in complete darkness. Her glasses and her 
shoes -- she has a habit of taking them off during her overnight shift -- were 
somewhere in as pile of overturned books and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the phone lines, pay phones or emergency lights were working. Along 
with the medical center and its 331 patients, Nolt was temporarily cut off from 
the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 Like any other grandmother, one of her first thoughts was of her family, and 
Nolt wondered how her son in Sherman Oaks, daughter in Sylmar and three 
grandchildren were.  
</P>
<P>
 But she said, "I was brought up to take care of my responsibilities." So, she 
felt her way back into the room with the switchboard, lit only by a little 
moonlight. A doctor gave her a flashlight and she was able to find her shoes 
and glasses, which luckily had not been broken.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was no place that was not covered with either books, paper or broken 
glass," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolt found she could not call out, but that the hospital could receive 
incoming calls. Within about 10 minutes, the first calls came from other VA 
hospitals, including those in West Los Angeles and Long Beach. She had those 
hospitals stay on hold so they could make calls for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I could tell them at the time was that the building was still standing," 
Nolt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had calls from all over the United States from different VA hospitals 
checking on how we were," Nolt said. "I was amazed at how many could get 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, hospital officials were able to get two of the four switchboards 
working so they could make long distance calls. But local calls were still 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 To help evacuate patients, hospital officials arranged for buses using the 
hospital police's portable radios, which had been brought in to replace an 
emergency radio destroyed in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Running on adrenaline, Nolt stayed on duty until noon that day. She was back 
that night, working a switchboard that had been set up outside. The next night, 
the switchboard was set up in a van where she has worked since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolt, who lives in Sylmar, said she was flabbergasted at winning the statewide 
award, which was presented to her at a ceremony in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was, how would you put it, awesome," Nolt said. ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; AIRPORT TO CHARGE ADDITIONAL $3 FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Burbank Airport will charge all outbound passengers an extra $3 fee, beginning 
Sept. 1, airport officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 The new fee, approved recently by federal officials, is expected to raise 
about $35 million over the next seven years to help pay for runway 
reconstruction, land acquisition and construction of an aircraft rescue and 
firefighting station, said Victor Gill, a Burbank Airport spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Airlines traditionally oppose such fees because they are tacked onto ticket 
prices. But all seven airlines that fly into Burbank Airport supported the fee 
because of the advantages that would spring from the improved facilities. No 
public opposition surfaced either, Gill said.  
</P>
<P>
 Since legislation was approved four years ago, airports around the nation have 
imposed the passenger facility charge, including Los Angeles International and 
Ontario Airport. But other Southern California airports, including Long Beach 
and San Diego, do not charge the fee. TRACEY KAPLAN

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; MAN GETS JAIL TERM IN PORNOGRAPHY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Burbank man who had pleaded guilty to three counts of exhibiting child 
pornography was sentenced to one year in Los Angeles County Jail, authorities 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a plea agreement, Adin Garner, 65, will remain on probation for five 
years after he is released and be subject to several special conditions during 
that time, said Deputy Dist. Atty.Greg Denton. 
</P>
<P>
 Garner's home can be searched for child pornography at any time, and he is 
prohibited from possessing any material of a pornographic nature during his 
probation, Denton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garner, who then lived in the Sunland-Tujunga area, was arrested at his home 
in December by Los Angeles police who had watched his mail order business since 
April, 1992, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives arrested Garner after they placed orders for child pornography 
videotapes using an alias and a post office box, authorities said at the time 
of his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Garner, who used the alias Mel Lennon, has been involved in 
the pornography distribution business since the 1960s, and that much of the 
material he was selling through videotapes were copies of old pornographic 
films. 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance, Garner made a child pornography tape by quickly turning the 
pages of old pictures of children in sexual situations in front of a camera, 
Denton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, he was doing this to make money, and what he had and sold was 
old, old videos that he sold through mail order," Denton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garner pleaded guilty to the charges June 16, Denton said. CHIP JOHNSON

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; COUNCIL APPROVES TAX ON UTILITY BILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to avoid massive cuts in next year's budget, the Agoura Hills 
City Council this week adopted a controversial tax on the use of electricity, 
gas and telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
 At its regular meeting Wednesday night, the council unanimously gave final 
approval to a 4% tax on utility use for residents and a 3.5% tax on commercial 
utility use. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is critical to the city's financial needs in terms of balancing the 
budget and providing for the needs of the community," said City Manager Terry 
Matz. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last several months, the measure was vigorously opposed by a local 
anti-tax group, which threatened to mount a recall drive against all five 
council members if they adopted the levy. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one person spoke against the tax at Wednesday night's meeting, however, 
Matz said. The anti-tax group has not filed recall papers with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also granted exemptions from the tax to senior citizens receiving 
supplemental Social Security benefits and households with very low income. 
</P>
<P>
 The utility tax is expected to bring in $726,500 next fiscal year to help fund 
the city's proposed $4.9-million spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
 That plan -- scheduled for consideration July 13 -- includes the layoffs of 
two full-time employees and five part-time workers and $270,000 in spending 
cuts. KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; INPUT SOUGHT ON BOULEVARD UPGRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A citizens advisory group will hold a series of community meetings this summer 
and fall to get public comment on preliminary concepts for street and sidewalk 
improvements on Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Urban Design/Streetscape Subcommittee of the Ventura Boulevard Specific 
Plan Review Board will hold a community meeting in Encino on Aug. 9 and in 
Studio City on Sept. 28. The dates of the Sherman Oaks and Tarzana meetings 
have not been set. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills is the furthest along in the process of creating a design plan 
for the street, with architects and advisory group members already refining 
their conceptual plan to incorporate public comments given at a May 18 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Two important issues for the program are who will pay for it and how much each 
payee will have to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan review board is considering two possibilities for raising the money: 
to create either a benefit assessment district that would tax property owners, 
or a business improvement district that would tax business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 A "very ballpark figure" for what property owners might have to pay if a 
benefit assessment district is created is 1 cent per square foot of their 
building per month for 15 years, according to Jeff Brain, chairman of the plan 
review board. 
</P>
<P>
 That means that a landlord who owns a 3,000-square-foot property on Ventura 
Boulevard would be assessed $30 a month for 15 years. Brain cautioned that the 
formula is merely intended to provide a point of reference. A different formula 
might be used, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new assessments would pay for a variety of improvements on the boulevard 
-- such as tree plantings, a shuttle-bus system and parking structures -- that 
are envisioned to increase business, allowing the assessed parties to recoup 
their costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The total budget for Streetscape improvements is $17 million, or $1 million 
per mile along the boulevard from Woodland Hills to Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first round of community meetings, the Streetscape subcommittee will 
adjust its sketches to incorporate public input, and then hold a second round 
of meetings to finalize the design concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 Brain said he expected the subcommittee to complete its recommendations, which 
will go to the city Planning Department, by the end of the year. Actual work on 
the program probably will not begin until late 1995, Brain predicted. KAY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS, TARZANA; 2 GRAFFITI VANDALS SENTENCED TO JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 18-year-old Granada Hills man has been sentenced to 70 days in jail for 
leaving a trail of graffiti across the northwest San Fernando Valley, while 
another teen-ager was sentenced to 90 days in jail for spray-painting a bus in 
Tarzana, the city attorney's office announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Adamar was sentenced Tuesday to 70 days in jail and 45 days of 
graffiti removal after he pleaded no contest to vandalism charges, said Mike 
Qualls of the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Adamar will be sentenced to an additional 230 days in jail if he fails to 
complete the graffiti removal requirement, Qualls said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Van Nuys Municipal Court Commissioner Mitchell Block placed Adamar on 
three years probation during which he will be prohibited from possessing any 
paint or markers, Qualls said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adamar allegedly belonged to a tagging crew called "Destroy Your Property," 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also this week, Block ordered Emiliano Hidalgo, 19, to serve 90 days in jail 
and three years probation for painting graffiti. Hidalgo had also pleaded no 
contest to vandalism charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo was arrested after undercover Los Angeles police officers on the 
anti-graffiti detail watched him scrawl his tag on the window of a Metropolitan 
Transportation Agency bus at Reseda and Ventura boulevards, prosecutors said.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CONEJO VALLEY; FARMERS' MARKET TO MOVE ACROSS STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks Farmers' Market will move across the street starting 
Thursday, with 60 produce and flower vendors setting up booths in the Village 
Square Center on Moorpark Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Displaced from Janss Mall because of construction, the farmers' market will 
move permanently to the center between Hillcrest and Brazil streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Valley market will retain its regular hours: 4 to 8 p.m. Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the new location is more visible and offers more parking, farmers' 
market manager Karen Wetzel predicted that sales would pick up after the move.  
</P>
<P>
 But Wetzel noted that when the Ventura Farmers' Market moved in 1991, vendors 
lost many faithful customers. Sales dropped 15% after the move and stayed 
depressed for up to six months. STEPHANIE SIMON

MAN AND WOMAN FOUND SHOT DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Deputies who stormed a condominium Thursday night after neighbors heard 
gunshots found the bodies of a man and woman, apparently the victims of a 
murder-suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-age daughter of the woman had escaped the condominium through a 
window.She also had suffered an ankle wound, and was taken to Mission Hospital 
Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo.  
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Lt. Randy Blair said the Sheriff's Department received a call at 
6:10 p.m. about three gunshots heard at the condominium on Poveda, in a complex 
named Finisterra on the Green, which borders the Mission Viejo Country Club 
golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 As they arrived, four more shots were reported to the Sheriff's Department.  
</P>
<P>
 The SWAT team was called, and at least four nearby condominiums were 
evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
 SWAT team members broke in the front door and found two bodies lying in the 
breakfast nook, fairly close together, Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
 They also found one handgun, but they would not say where.

FAIR OFFICIALS BEEFING UP SECURITY FOR THIS YEAR'S RUN; SAFETY: THE MOVE IS IN 
RESPONSE TO PROBLEMS LAST YEAR, INCLUDING MOLESTATION OF SOME CHILDREN IN A 
HAUNTED HOUSE BY A CARNIVAL WORKER AND A ROLLER COASTER ACCIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to a series of mishaps that marred last year's Orange County Fair, 
officials plan to beef up security, more closely monitor carnival rides and 
perform drug tests on some of the hundreds of temporary employees who staff 
booths and attractions during the annual festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The new safety measures are aimed at preventing the kinds of incidents that 
occurred last year, when a carnival worker fondled five children in a dark 
haunted house and eight people were injured in a roller coaster accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to know that we are not taking (the incidents) lightly. We are 
doing something about it," said Jill Lloyd, spokeswoman for the fair. The new 
measures "say that this is a safe and fun place for the family. That is our 
ultimate goal." 
</P>
<P>
 B & B Amusements, which operates the fair's carnival, has decided not to bring 
back the haunted house where the molestations occurred.  
</P>
<P>
 Shawnee M e rten, business manager and marketing head for B & B, said the 
haunted house was removed to make way for more popular rides such as bumper 
cars. But Lloyd acknowledged that parents probably will feel relieved that the 
attraction will be gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair officials also plan to hire an additional 35 security officers for the 
fair, which will run from July 8 through 24. The extra staffing will bring the 
fairgrounds' total private guard force to about 165, Lloyd said. Last year, the 
fair employed 130 security guards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Sheriff's Department also plans to increase its patrols at 
the fair, but officials have not disclosed by how much. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, more non-uniformed fair workers will be assigned to walk through 
the carnival. The fair will also place a second guest-relations office in the 
carnival area. 
</P>
<P>
 "All this provides an extra set of eyes and ears," Lloyd said. "It allows us 
to handle questions and concerns more quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 The added security presence comes in response to molestations that occurred 
last year inside the Cactus Jack Haunted Shack, an attraction in which children 
walked through a series of dark narrow passageways. 
</P>
<P>
 Five teen-age girls reported being fondled by carnival worker Richard Allen 
Lee, who worked at a nearby game booth. Lee, 42, pleaded guilty to five counts 
of child molestation and was sentenced to eight years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to his stint at the fair, Lee had been convicted of two prior counts of 
child molestation, prompting some to suggest that temporary fair employees be 
subject to criminal background checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd said that the fair and B & B Amusements have ruled out the idea because 
such investigations would be too costly and could not be completed in a timely 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, background checks would require obtaining records from several 
law enforcement agencies in different states and might not be completed until 
the fair was over, she said. Instead, all B & B's temporary carnival workers 
will be subject to random drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
 B & B officials also plan to more closely monitor the assorted carnival rides 
by having foremen inspect certain attractions. These "team leaders" will keep 
an eye on the ride operators to make sure they are taking regular breaks and 
working the equipment properly, Merten said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, eight people were hurt when two roller coaster cars filled with 
passengers crashed into an empty car, which in turn hit a car being loaded with 
passengers. State inspectors blamed the crash on operator error.

EX-OFFICER PLEADS INNOCENT IN COMPUTER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Los Angeles police officer pleaded not guilty Thursday to 11 felony 
counts of illegally accessing department computers to obtain confidential 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Ray Bentley Jr., 47, of Granada Hills was arraigned on charges in Los 
Angeles Municipal Court that carry a maximum penalty of six years in prison if 
he is convicted, a prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentley, a Los Angeles police officer for 23 years, resigned from the force 
last year after he was arrested on charges of possessing child pornography and 
receiving stolen property. Most recently, he had worked in the department's 
Juvenile Division. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest round of legal troubles for Bentley, prosecutors accuse him of 
obtaining information from Police Department computers about various people -- 
including witnesses in criminal cases -- and passing it on to private 
investigation firms run by retired LAPD Deputy Chief Daniel R. Sullivan and 
Thomas Whiteaker, who owns a Mission Hills private investigation firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Sullivan pleaded not guilty to charges that he illegally possessed 
confidential law enforcement information in the files of his Woodland 
Hills-based detective agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Whiteaker will be arraigned later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Sullivan has admitted that Bentley worked for his detective agency, he 
said Bentley retrieved only court records and other publicly available 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police officers can legally access the department's computer system 
to retrieve a variety of information, they are required to sign a pledge not to 
misuse their computer privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike publicly accessible court files, police computer records include 
information about arrests that never resulted in a charge or a conviction, and 
therefore are not public information. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a misdemeanor to illegally access such information, said Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Alan Yokelson, who is prosecuting the three men, but prosecutors can 
increase those charges to a felony if the violators conspire to provide the 
information to someone outside the department. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary hearing for Bentley is scheduled for Aug. 19.

BOY, 4, IN BEATING CASE IMPROVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 4-year-old boy, allegedly choked and beaten by his mother's boyfriend, is no 
longer in a coma and has been taken off a respirator, a prosecutor and hospital 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the boyfriend, Fateheen Rahman, 22, of Glendale remains jailed on 
$500,000 bail and faces a preliminary hearing Wednesday on attempted murder and 
child abuse charges in connection with the June 12 incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Rahman was baby-sitting Jason Thivener and his twin sister Jessica in their 
Van Nuys home because the children's mother was suddenly called to work and the 
regular baby-sitter was not available, Deputy Dist. Atty. Lea Purwin D'Agostino 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After ordering the twins to stop crying, Rahman allegedly slapped and choked 
Jason. Jessica was not seriously injured and is now living with her father in 
another state, D'Agostino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Trinidad, a spokeswoman for Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, said 
Jason is in serious but stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has improved slightly," she said, adding that the child has displayed 
"some spastic movement." 
</P>
<P>
 D'Agostino said she expects paramedics, doctors and the twins' 25-year-old 
mother to testify next week at the preliminary hearing in Van Nuys Municipal 
Court.

CITY HASN'T GIVEN UP ON RAMS YET; PRO SPORTS: MAYOR DALY REASSURES TEAM VP SHAW 
THAT ANAHEIM IS STILL WORKING TO KEEP THE FRANCHISE IN TOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mayor Tom Daly met with a top Los Angeles Rams official Thursday to "keep the 
lines of communication open" and reassure the team that the city is still 
trying to keep the team in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said John Shaw, the executive vice president of the Rams, "was neither 
really encouraging or discouraging" about the prospect of the team staying in 
Anaheim after the upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor said he did not discuss specific proposals with Shaw during the 
45-minute meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Daly and some business leaders, including sports agent Leigh 
Steinberg and former Disneyland President Jack L. Lindquist, have formed a 
"Save the Rams" committee to explore ways of enticing the football team to stay 
in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindquist and Steinberg also have tentatively scheduled a meeting with Shaw 
for Tuesday. Daly said any plan to keep the Rams here must have the 
participation of the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, city officials are quietly working on plans to overhaul Anaheim 
Stadium to make it more profitable for the Rams and the California Angels 
baseball team, as well as examining ways to finance construction of a new 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are soliciting offers from other cities throughout the country, 
including Baltimore and St. Louis, which want to lure the team away from 
Anaheim. Shaw has said the team's current financial arrangement and stadium are 
inferior to what other cities can offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams in May exercised a 15-month escape clause in their Anaheim Stadium 
lease. The notice can be revoked within that period. A source close to the Rams 
said the team may make a decision as early as September to move to another 
city.

 A real estate agent's disappearance has a small Santa Clarita Valley town in 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of her Val Verde neighbors joined Thursday with sheriff's 
search-and-rescue parties to look for Paula Harrington, 26, who vanished a day 
earlier. By late afternoon they abruptly suspended their search and announced 
that a man taken into custody earlier had been cleared and released. 
</P>
<P>
 But detectives said they believe foul play was involved in the disappearance 
after they discovered the back door unlocked on the last of five homes the 
woman showed to a prospective client. 
</P>
<P>
 They also discovered that the license plates of the Jeep Cherokee the client 
drove were stolen from a car in Pismo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of those and other things we can't go into, we're confident there was 
foul play," said Sheriff's Sgt. Ron Spear. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington also was seen by a bank security camera making an ATM withdrawal of 
$300 from a Bank of America branch in Hacienda Heights Wednesday night, said 
Lt. Donald Bear, a sheriff's homicide detective. Family members identified 
Harrington from a photo taken by the bank camera that showed only her head and 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not anyone obviously beside her or behind her," Bear said. "There 
weren't any obvious signs of her being stressed out." 
</P>
<P>
 Bear said four detectives are working on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members told investigators Harrington would not run off. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least we know she's a hostage as opposed to being hurt or worse," said the 
woman's husband, Chris Harrington. "There's no doubt in my mind she didn't run 
away. Our marriage is fine and she wouldn't leave her family to stress like 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington disappeared after leaving her office Wednesday afternoon with an 
unidentified man who asked to see vacant, remote houses in the unincorporated 
community of 1,500 off California 126 about five miles northwest of Magic 
Mountain amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
 DeAnne Tippetts, owner of Century 21 Country Realtors, said she grew 
suspicious when they hadn't returned after about 2 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just kind of an uneasy feeling," she said. "The more I thought about 
it -- how he wanted to see vacant homes in remote areas -- it started bothering 
me. That and the fact that he insisted they use his car." 
</P>
<P>
 A search began later, using ground teams and helicopters to scour the 
surrounding hills. "Everybody knows everybody out here," said Kimberly Pepin, 
who volunteered for the search effort. "They're very generous people." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County deputies found a Jeep Cherokee in Fillmore that matched the 
description of the vehicle Harrington was seen leaving the office in. The owner 
of the vehicle was detained by police while two witnesses were brought to the 
motel parking lot and identified him as the man who had accompanied the missing 
real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
 The identification turned out to be wrong and the man was released when it was 
determined he was attending a business meeting in Agoura on Wednesday 
afternoon, Bear said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives discovered later that the plates of the suspect's car were stolen, 
though they are not sure when. The man being sought by police is described as a 
white male of medium build in his 40s with thinning brown hair. 
</P>
<P>
 The missing woman is 5 feet, 3 inches tall, 120 pounds, with blond hair and 
blue eyes. She was last seen wearing a teal blouse and a jungle-print skirt, 
and may have been wearing glasses, deputies said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SANTA CLARITA TO CREATE PANEL TO ADDRESS 
RACIAL ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with a flurry of recent racially motivated incidents, City Council 
members this week authorized creation of a Cultural Diversity Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers hope to model it after Santa Clarita's existing Anti-Gang Task 
Force, created in 1991. That group has been boosted by strong citizen 
participation and has successfully pushed for city ordinances establishing 
curfews for youths and a reward program for information about taggers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we do that same type of thing, get a better indication of the issue and 
educate people. . . . I think it can be successful," said City Manager George 
Caravalho, who has the responsibility of creating the group. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is being formed in response to calls for action from local residents 
in the wake of two brawls between students and alleged white supremacists in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
 The exact format of the task force is undetermined. Caravalho said he will 
first meet informally with community members for ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he hopes to have the group operating by the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a hands-on kind of thing. I don't see it as a group of adults 
standing around and talking about issues," said Councilwoman Jan Heidt. "I'm 
envisioning the group as an idea provider, and I would solicit suggestions from 
the kids and the parents." 
</P>
<P>
 The fights at Canyon High were the latest in a string of racially motivated 
incidents that have plagued Santa Clarita in recent months. More than 200 
students at the school there signed a petition and billboard-sized poster, both 
denouncing racism, that they presented to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sad truth will come after the violence," wrote one student. "When we look 
at the cuts and . . . realize that we are all the same color on the inside." 
</P>
<P>
 "Wouldn't it be boring if everyone was the same?" wrote another. 
</P>
<P>
 Hate literature has appeared intermittently in Santa Clarita, beginning in 
December with a few anti-Latino leaflets tucked into grocery store products. 
Then in March, more than 1,000 of the anti-Latino flyers were stuffed into 
student lockers at Placerita Junior High School.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PROPOSED PALMDALE BUDGET WOULD REDUCE CITY'S 
SPENDING BY 8%; FINANCES: DESPITE CUTS, LAW ENFORCEMENT FUNDING WOULD BE 
INCREASED $1.2 MILLION. THE PLAN CALLS FOR HANDING CROSSING GUARD PROGRAM OVER 
TO LOCAL SCHOOLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the last day of the fiscal year, city officials Thursday unveiled a 
$28.7-million general fund budget for 1994-95, calling for a $1.2-million boost 
for law enforcement, but an overall 8% spending cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the budget plan, the city would also stop paying for crossing guards, 
handing the $224,000 program over to local schools. In another cost-cutting 
move announced last week, the city has laid off six employees and eliminated 
seven other jobs that were not currently filled. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is slated to hold a public hearing on the budget July 12, 
then vote on it the next day. To allow the city to continue operating without a 
budget in the meantime, the council adopted an ordinance allowing current 
spending levels to remain in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 In his budget message, City Administrator Robert W. Toone Jr. said, "Staff is 
committed to maintaining the service level that residents have come to expect. 
This will be a difficult task as our population is still increasing, and we 
have fewer city employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Between January, 1993, and January, 1994, Palmdale's population jumped 9.6% 
from 89,717 to 98,314, according to the state Department of Finance. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1980s, Palmdale was one of California's fastest-growing cities, but 
local officials said the economic slowdown, particularly in new construction, 
is a key reason for this year's tight budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale issued about 450 building permits for new single-family homes during 
the past year, compared with the 5,046 permits issued in fiscal 1989-90. The 
local unemployment rate is 9.3%, compared to 6% nationally. Sales-tax revenue, 
an important source of income for Palmdale, has leveled off after a decade of 
growth, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his message, Toone said the city's priorities have shifted from housing 
development and road-building to public safety and economic development, 
including the creation of more local jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Increased law enforcement was a key issue in last spring's Palmdale City 
Council election. The new budget allocates $8 million for law enforcement, 
provided by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Some of the additional 
money will put three more one-deputy patrol cars on the street, each for 56 
hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Other city departments would receive less money under the new budget proposal, 
particularly those that handle new development projects, such as planning, 
engineering and building and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Toone also recommended turning over the crossing guard program to the Palmdale 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last year, state law required cities and counties to pay for crossing 
guards in their jurisdiction. Because the state no longer mandates this, the 
city staff urged that the expense of using about 20 guards be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation caught the Palmdale School District off-guard, said Supt. 
Nancy K. Smith, who learned about it from news reporters. "We were very 
surprised because we usually have such good rapport with the city," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said taking over the crossing guard program would pose problems because 
the school district, which has 16,600 kindergarten through eighth-grade 
students, has already approved its 1994-95 budget. She said crossing guards 
cannot be eliminated because students need adult supervision at busy local 
intersections. 
</P>
<P>
 Other school programs might need to be cut if the district must take over the 
crossing guard program, and costs would increase because the school district 
runs under different labor laws than the city, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the school board will discuss the issue at a meeting Tuesday and may 
send a representative to the city's budget hearing to ask that the cutback be 
reconsidered. 
</P>
<P>
 Other sections of the city's 1994-95 spending plan call for construction of 
several civic projects, including a new City Hall, financed largely by 
developer fees, and a new park named for longtime resident Domenic Massari.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; LANCASTER MAN HANGS HIMSELF AFTER 
SPOUSAL-ABUSE ARREST 
</P>

<P>
 A Lancaster man hung himself in a holding cell at the Antelope Valley 
Sheriff's Station in an apparent suicide just six hours after being arrested on 
suspicion of spousal abuse, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 A cellmate discovered Todd Fenske, 25, hanging from his bed at 4 p.m. Monday, 
said Deputy Angie McLaughlin.The cellmate, whose identity was not released, had 
been sleeping prior to discovering Fenske. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin said deputies cut the 6-foot, 4-inch, 260-pound man free, but 
efforts by paramedics to revive him were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 Fenske was arrested at 10:45 a.m. Monday on suspicion of felony spousal abuse 
and was being held in lieu of $50,000 bail, said McLaughlin. He was to be 
arraigned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members declined to discuss Fenske's suicide and referred calls to 
Lancaster attorney David Wallin. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallin said he is still gathering details of Fenske's death but that the 
family may file a wrongful death suit against the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "If our investigation shows the Sheriff's Department was negligent in their 
duty to take care of one of their inmates, then wrongful death may be the 
result," Wallin said. "The family has some problems with some of the things the 
Sheriff's Department did in regard to this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallin said Fenske's wife only filed a report of spousal abuse on assurances 
that her husband would not be arrested. Fenske was arrested 30 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department was unable Thursday afternoon to provide information 
on the number of suicides that occur in sheriff's station holding cells.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; WASTE SHIPMENTS NEAR LANCASTER BEGIN TODAY; 
ENVIRONMENT: UP TO 150 TONS PER DAY WILL BE TRUCKED IN FROM EL CAJON. BIDS TO 
HALT THE PROJECT HAVE FAILED.

<P>
 Trucks full of garbage from the city of El Cajon will begin arriving in the 
Lancaster area today, despite repeated efforts by local environmentalists and 
other residents to keep them from coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Universal Refuse Removal, based in El Cajon, said it will initially haul as 
much as 150 tons of commercial waste a day to a privately owned landfill just 
outside the Lancaster city limits. By mid-July, when residential waste is also 
transported, the daily amount could reach 300 tons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very encouraged," said Rex Buck, general manager for Universal Refuse 
Removal. "It's a good deal for the citizens of El Cajon." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, San Diego Superior Court Judge William J. Howatt took under 
submission a request for an immediate stay and court order to prevent El Cajon 
from dumping its trash in Lancaster, but a decision could not come in time to 
stop at least the start of the dumping. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle Talbot, an Antelope Valley environmental activist, said Thursday that he 
is not optimistic the judge will rule in favor of the request. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel we will not win," said Talbot. "Our next administrative relief would 
be to go to the state Regional Water Quality Control Board." 
</P>
<P>
 Talbot said the water agency would be asked to review the permit it issued to 
Waste Management, the owner of the Lancaster landfill and also the parent 
company of Universal Refuse Removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the dumping plan already failed in an attempt to persuade the El 
Cajon City Council to derail it. Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich 
was also unsuccessful in his bid to get the board to prohibit the dumping of 
out-of-county garbage in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Buck said El Cajon residents will benefit from the long-distance 
disposal of their waste. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in the best interest of the citizens of El Cajon," he said. "The 
disposal rate at the San Diego County-run landfill has gone up every year for 
the past five years. This gives the citizens of El Cajon some relief." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the 320-mile round-trip trek the trash trucks will make six days a 
week to bring El Cajon's trash to Lancaster, residents of the San Diego area 
city will see their disposal rate drop $1 per month to $13.16. 
</P>
<P>
 Universal Refuse trash trucks, measuring 59 feet in length and with 18-ton 
capacities, will make as many as 12 round trips each day from El Cajon to 
Lancaster, said Buck. The round-trip distance is 320 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Buck said virtually all of El Cajon's residential, commercial and industrial 
waste -- about 75,000 tons annually -- will be disposed of in Lancaster.

CARJACKERS WHO DIED IN CRASH ARE IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The two young carjackers who died in a high-speed crash Wednesday have been 
identified as Esteban Agustin Nunez Jr. of Camarillo, 18, and his cousin, 
19-year-old Eugene Anthony Nunez of Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, 53-year-old Paul Castriades of Camarillo was sipping coffee at a 
McDonald's in Camarillo in his Hertz rental car about 3:25 p.m. when two men 
walked up and held a serrated steak knife to his throat, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After ordering Castriades out of the maroon Nissan Altima, the men drove off, 
only to be spotted minutes later speeding over the Conejo Grade on the Ventura 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The car was traveling 90 to 100 m.p.h. when the driver lost control, police 
said. A steak knife believed to have been used in the carjacking was found 
inside the crushed Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Sheriff's Lt. Craig Husband said Esteban Nunez was considered a 
gang member by the Sheriff's Department.  
</P>
<P>
 Police records show that Esteban Nunez was arrested Feb. 26 along with seven 
other people on suspicion of illegally entering a vacant home on Potrero Road 
in Newbury Park.

MS. FIXIT; IN O.C. CLASSROOMS, SUPPLY STORES WOMEN FIND THE RIGHT TOOLS TO BE 
HANDY AROUND THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Single mother Diane Thompson says she does a lot of things with her 
17-year-old son these days -- shooting hoops, helping with homework and 
replacing the rubber flappers on the toilets in their rented Huntington Beach 
home.  
</P>
<P>
 The plumbing may not be the most enjoyable activity the 34-year-old computer 
technician shares with her son, but it is a necessary part of living in the 
'90s for Thompson and many other women who, for reasons of pride and economy, 
choose to tackle their own household projects and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to fix things," said Thompson, who has done everything from minor 
wiring to re-plumbing the mobile home she used to live in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me frustrated when I can't do it myself." 
</P>
<P>
 With half of American marriages ending in divorce and more than 19 million 
mothers in the national work force, the women of today are fast replacing 
yesterday's handymen. And most claim that being the "lady of the house" today 
is a loftier title than it used to be, with a resume containing a list of 
domestic responsibilities longer than just decorating and hanging drapes. 
</P>
<P>
 This new breed of tool-toting handywomen comes from all economic strata -- 
from the young divorcee who owns a $2 million home in Anaheim Hills to the 
Santa Ana nurse who just wants to improve her modest surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 They say they're tired of being taken advantage of because they don't 
understand the details of home repair. They're also driven to save money as 
many struggle to raise children alone. More and more men are also content to 
let their mates do the handy work while they do other chores. 
</P>
<P>
 "I replaced the hose on the washing machine," boasts Costa Mesa mother Kim 
Anderson. "I like to do it myself," she said. "You know it's done right when 
you do it yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson says that in addition to a couple of preschoolers and a tight budget, 
her husband Jeff's 50- to 70-hour workweek has a lot to do with her role as 
Mrs. Fixit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do everything around here because my husband works so much, and we can't 
afford to have someone else come out and do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Anderson says he is both amazed and relieved by his wife's abilities. Her 
efforts save them a lot of money on costly labor, he says, while giving her a 
sense accomplishment. The couple is currently painting their home, a job they 
do together when he's not working. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really proud of her," he said. "She's always doing something." 
</P>
<P>
 Loreen Erdtsieck says she's an example of a modern-day divorcee who can afford 
to hire someone to fix leaky facets and make minor repairs but has come to 
enjoy doing it herself. With a Porsche and new Ford Explorer in the garage of 
her Corona del Mar house, the mother of 10-year-old twin boys says her reasons 
for doing her own household repairs isn't financial. Ironically, she says she 
credits her ex-husband with her ability as a handywoman of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lived in a 12,000-square-foot house in Anaheim Hills, and I did everything 
because he wouldn't do anything to keep it up," Erdtsieck said. "Now, I don't 
mind it at all, because I'm doing it for myself." 
</P>

 Home Depot reports that about half of the 1 million annual customers that come 
into each of the chain's 281 U.S. home improvement stores are women. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not unusual to see women being self-reliant, and we see that in our 
stores," said Home Depot spokesman Jerry Fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-headquartered Home Base reports a similar presence of women in its 
do-it-yourself chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five years ago, the 'weekend warriors' were men," says John Lang, manager of 
Home Base's Santa Ana store. "That's completely turned around now. You find 
yourself dealing a lot more with women, and they're doing the jobs themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 While giving a Saturday afternoon demonstration on how to lay ceramic tile, 
Home Base design specialist Carla Parga looked down at her own hands and smiled 
at the customers gathered around the table. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hands aren't women's hands; they're working hands," she said, trying to 
keep her long hair back as she smoothed the white grout over the tile. 
</P>
<P>
 Parga, who has more than one home-improvement store on her resume, says that 
"women can do anything, especially if they have the attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Carmen Blas held a fistful of how-to pamphlets and watched the demonstration 
from beginning to end, often asking common first-timer questions. She said she 
became interested in doing more things around the house after buying a 
fixer-upper in Santa Ana a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to learn to know more about it," she said, "The people you hire, they 
charge you money and cut corners to take advantage (of you)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Female do-it-yourselfers say the attitude toward them is beginning to change, 
but all have tales of being overlooked or patronized in neighborhood hardware 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, if you ask for a tool, they treat you like you're getting it for 
your husband or some other man," said Thompson, recalling a time when she was 
told a plumbing project she was working on was too dangerous for a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a whole lot of men who know a whole lot less than (women) know, and 
they don't treat them like that."  
</P>
<P>
 Rod Albright, manager of Albright Plumbing in Los Alamitos, agrees, saying 
women tend to be very good household plumbers -- even better than men in some 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women aren't afraid to ask questions, and they listen when you tell them how 
to do something," Albright said, "With men, there's this macho thing like, 
'Hey, I know how to do it,' then they get home and can't do the job." 
</P>
<P>
 In his nine years near the corner of Los Alamitos Boulevard and Cerritos, 
Albright says there has been a trend toward the female customer taking on jobs 
that she used to hire a plumber to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past five years, we've noticed that there's a lot more women doing 
their own plumbing, and we show them how to do it," he said. "They listen. You 
don't have that communication problem." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The surge of wrench-wielding women has made its way into the classroom, too, 
with more and more enrolling in how-to classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Coastline Community College spokeswoman Gail Jones says the number of women 
signing up for how-to classes from construction to auto repair has been 
"growing steadily," with a 10% increase each semester.

 "I get a wide variety (of women students)," says Don Hunsicker, who teaches 10 
building inspection courses at Coastline, "anywhere from secretaries to women 
who are inspectors already." 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, Hunsicker says, he has seen more female students in the 
past five years who just want to be educated about what has always been a 
male-dominated field. Many of his female students say they signed up because 
they don't want to be easy prey for building contractors and others workers 
they may hire to do large jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're simply women who have decided that they're going to do some sort of 
remodeling to their home, and they want to know what to expect," Hunsicker 
said. "They don't want to be bamboozled by some fast-talking individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Home Base spokeswoman Carol Elfstrom says that three-fourths of the chain's 
customers are do-it-yourselfers, and the company has recently put renewed 
emphasis on service. They offer several free how-to booklets and instructional 
clinics and try to keep a helpful, non-patronizing atmosphere, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "From your casual do-it-yourselfer to the contractors, it's recognition of the 
fact that any customer is well worth the time," Elfstrom said. "We didn't just 
single out women, saying 'you guys aren't being nice to women'; all customers 
are important, and the female is a very important customer to us."

 Although more Orange County women seem to be getting their hands dirty these 
days, Orange County handymen claim they haven't lost much work to tool-belted 
housewives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're busy seven days a week," says Susan Hussni of Kan Do-It-All in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Hussni says about 75% of the customers who call her labor-only handyman 
business are women, keeping the four guys on duty very busy. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of my customers are women who get great prices on a toilet or something 
and can't put it in," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Do-it-yourself stores such as Home Base and Home Depot have actually bolstered 
the 4-year-old business, Hussni says, because people buy the discounted 
hardware and hire their handymen to make it work. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't enough handymen out there; we're really busy." 
</P>

 Pushing the heavy metal cart of lumber toward the cashier's counter at Home 
Base, 63-year-old Rachel Sandoval moved with determination. She was building a 
bird cage in the yard of her Santa Ana home and seemed ready to pound some 
nails. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yep, I've always done everything," she said. "Let's see, I paint, I cut the 
lawn. . . . I enjoy it; it keeps my mind busy."

 Get this: I've been denied earthquake assistance on the grounds that it would 
interfere with freedom of the press and freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
 No kidding. The government told me so. Here's exactly what the May 21, 1994, 
letter from the Small Business Administration says: 
</P>
<P>
 "The applicant's main activity is not eligible for assistance under the 
economic injury disaster loan program. Concerns engaged in the creation, 
origination, expression, dissemination, preparation or distribution of ideas, 
values, thoughts, opinions, or similar intellectual property, are not eligible 
for Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) assistance. Such assistance is barred 
by federal regulation in order to avoid government interference, or the 
appearance of interference, with the constitutionally protected freedom of 
speech and press." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A nice guy I spoke to at the SBA in Sacramento explained it more succinctly: 
"It's strange, but because you traffic in ideas, we can't help you." 
</P>
<P>
 I've often heard that governments are threatened by ideas. Taxation without 
representation was a potent one. So is freedom. I had two reactions to the SBA 
decision: I found it flattering that the U.S. government would describe my kind 
of hack journalism "trafficking in ideas." And I wondered -- just what ideas I 
had been trafficking in? Hmmm. . . . Well, if there is a vague idealistic 
purpose to my writing, it has something to do with exposing absurdity, 
encouraging kindness and making snide remarks about Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
 That was it! Had Madonna dumped the NBA for someone at the SBA? Nah. The name 
alone would repel her. I thought some more. Yes, well, the government would 
have a great fear of someone bent on exposing absurdity. 
</P>
<P>
 The nice guy in Sacramento, however, assured me that the SBA decision was 
nothing personal -- just part of the Byzantine minutia of constitutional 
interpretation, more of the stuff that helps this great, free country remain 
great and free. What it comes down to, really, is that the government has 
recognized me as one-man media organization. In other words, if Uncle Sam helps 
me out, he's meddling with the free media (and, by implication, free speech). 
</P>
<P>
 So, in the interest of free speech, I don't get any free bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Understand, please, that this is no shock. I expected nothing, given my 
already peculiar post-quake dealings. (Brace yourself, Uncle Sam, I'm about to 
expose absurdity!) Here's what happened. My Sherman Oaks apartment building was 
well fractured by the Little Big One. All occupants except me and an elderly 
neighbor deserted within a week. I wanted to move, too, in those first few days 
but couldn't afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go to FEMA," one of my neighbors told me. "They're paying my moving 
expenses!" 
</P>
<P>
 Wow. That sounded pretty good. She qualified for a grant, she said, because a 
Federal Emergency Management Agency inspector deemed her apartment 
uninhabitable. This was encouraging -- her cubicle was hardly more cracked than 
mine. Still, I figured that a whole hell of a lot of people needed relocation 
money worse than I did. I had no stove or hot water for weeks, and a ceiling as 
scarred as Frankenstein's forehead, but I'd get by. Let the extremely needy get 
the immediate money. Besides, President Clinton's noble words of post-quake 
comfort echoed in my head, something about don't cheat the federal government. 
So inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, I phoned FEMA to ask for a grant (a grand or two) to cover the 
period (about one month) when I was unable to work because of displacement and 
cleanup. My first FEMA conversation, which could have been written by Joseph 
Heller, went about like this: 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to apply for a small business loan." 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm not a small business. I'm a free-lance writer. And I never borrow 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know, but if you want a grant, you have to apply for an SBA loan." 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't want an SBA loan. I'm not a small business." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know. But you'll get turned down for an SBA loan, then you qualify for a 
grant!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is that?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just how it works." 
</P>
<P>
 You can't argue with statements like that, so I applied for an SBA loan. At 
roughly the same time, a FEMA inspector came to my sorry hovel, glanced around 
for about three minutes and determined that it was one spiffy place to live. 
Weeks passed. I phoned FEMA again, but FEMA told me to call the SBA. When I 
phoned the SBA, I had to explain my situation to three or four more people. A 
few days later, the SBA asked in a letter for my monthly profit-loss 
statements, and liability information for employees. I phoned the SBA again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't fill out these forms because I'm not a small business," I said. "My 
only employees are my hands and investigatory senses." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're not a small business, then why did you apply for an SBA loan?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Because FEMA told me to." 
</P>
<P>
 After much clucking with supervisors, I was finally advised to voluntarily 
withdraw my SBA application. 
</P>
<P>
 "That way," the SBA person said, "you can qualify for a grant." 
</P>
<P>
 But, I protested, FEMA instructed that I had to be turned down for an SBA loan 
in order to qualify for a grant. The SBA person allowed that this might be 
true, but urged me to withdraw the loan application and apply directly for a 
grant, because I wasn't a small business. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I keep telling everyone," I said, and withdrew the application. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthropologists, take note. My next FEMA encounter provided dramatic evidence 
that we are all indeed the results of an extraterrestrial experiment on 
primates gone terribly wrong. It went like this: 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, sir," a FEMA supervisor said, "one of our inspectors pronounced your 
home fit to live in, so you don't qualify for a grant." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, but a neighbor of mine received a relocation grant, and she was not much 
more cracked than I was -- her walls, I mean." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I don't know anything about that, sir." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, that's why I'm telling you about it." 
</P>
<P>
 He merely grunted and announced that I should have, way back in January, asked 
for disaster welfare unemployment assistance. He apologized for his colleagues 
who had failed to suggest it. "That's OK," I said, "I have a friend who got it. 
It came to about $20 a week. I'll pass." 
</P>
<P>
 Follow me now, if you will, one last time to SBA headquarters in Sacramento. 
It seems those overworked folks never figured out that I had, on their advice, 
withdrawn my loan application. So, although I had canceled the request, the 
diligent SBA had continued soberly evaluating my situation, ultimately sending 
the remarkable letter disqualifying me on the basis of protecting the integrity 
of the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Phew. 
</P>
<P>
 It occurs to me that, because I am now recognized as a bona fide one-man free 
speech industry, I am duty-bound here to, um, traffic in a few ideas about my 
attempts to get earthquake relief. Here goes. First, I believe the agencies I 
dealt with, while well-intentioned, advised me very stupidly. Second, I think 
those who denied me funds on the basis of violating federal law, while 
well-intentioned, are possibly in need of long vacations. 
</P>
<P>
 And I believe my right to say that in a newspaper is part of the 
constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech and press. 
</P>
<P>
 Which also, sadly, protects the utterances of Madonna.

CUTTER'S WAY; RALPH CUTTER IS INTO FLY-FISHING -- REALLY, REALLY INTO 
FLY-FISHING. HE LIVES AND BREATHES TROUT. AND NOW, HE'S SHARING HIS PASSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Five hours into Ralph Cutter's two-day fly-fishing class, a woman's jaw goes 
slack. "My gawd!" she yelps. "You're really into this!" 
</P>
<P>
 Cutter pauses. With a digital tensile scale dangling from one hand, the 
fishing line whose strength he is about to test in another, he lets a sliver of 
boyish grin crack his face. 
</P>
<P>
 Other students, however, fix the woman with stares that say: "Duh!" 
</P>
<P>
 Most, after all, had noticed a bit sooner that Cutter's into- itiveness is on 
a different order, even for this notoriously obsession-prone pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 What tipped them off? How about: 
</P>
<P>
 * The way Cutter blurts, "I like bugs!" and explicates, "Without flies, there 
would be no fly-fishing," as he shows detailed charts depicting metamorphic 
cycles of aquatic insects. 
</P>
<P>
 * The way his eyes bulge troutlike as he wriggles a stuffed fabric fish around 
the room, imagining that the fish is hungry and that the ceiling is the river's 
bug-covered surface. 
</P>
<P>
 * His enthusiasm as he superimposes graphs on an overhead projector, 
demonstrating the precise point at which a stream's or lake's oxygenation level 
and water temperature combine to create optimum conditions for a trout's 
metabolism. 
</P>
<P>
 * The quaver in his voice as he rallies the class to watch an emerging mayfly 
in the insect-breeding aquarium in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 * The photograph above that aquarium of a hefty Yucatan crocodile Cutter 
hooked on a colorful dry fly. 
</P>
<P>
 * His insistence that students kneel on the floor to get a fish-eye view as he 
sprinkles nutritionally correct crickets into a tank containing a gorgeous 
Golden Trout. 
</P>
<P>
 * The story of that trout's genesis: 
</P>
<P>
 "About three years ago, I wanted to get photographs of an egg evolving, from 
the time it's fertilized till the time the head pokes out," Cutter says. "We 
hiked up to the headwaters of the Kern River. I had a little net, and caught a 
male and a female trout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took the female trout, and gently squeezed her flanks, till the eggs came 
out into a Sierra cup. Then I took the male and squeezed out the sperm. I 
swirled them together and let them sit for 24 hours in the river. Then I put 
the eggs in a water bottle, packed them in snow and hiked out. . . . One 
survived." 
</P>
<P>
 So, yes, Ralph Cutter would seem to be into fly-fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 That settled, though, students may well light upon another, bigger question. 
It's one they may also ask of themselves sometime during his $395 "Complete Fly 
Fishing" course: 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something about fly-fishing that's esoteric and cool," Cutter says, 
his fingers sparring nimbly with a wisp of knot that a hot, pine-scented wind 
is determined to confuse. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not the real answer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph, 39, and his wife Lisa, 38, run their California School of Fly Fishing 
in the modern, two-story, solar-heated home that Lisa designed and her brother 
built, on three pine- and fir-covered acres outside the Tahoe-area town of 
Truckee. 
</P>
<P>
 As Ralph teaches, his daughter Teal, 11, ferries a basket of mini-muffins to 
each of the 10 students. Her 9-year-old sister, Haley, hovers on the periphery, 
utterly at ease with the strangers in her house. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only wall or shelf in the home not dominated by trout paintings and 
bric-a-brac is the one featuring old family photographs -- and the ubiquitous 
motif creeps in here too. 
</P>
<P>
 One photo, from 1910, shows Cutter's great-grandfather, Ed, a Fresno-area 
veterinary pharmacist, with his three sons, in the Kennedy Meadows area of the 
Eastern Sierra. All clutch fly rods. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed explored and mapped parts of the Sierra. He also loaded mules with milk 
cans full of trout and planted the range's high, barren lakes. His three sons 
followed the same path, and their trips inspired two inventions that became as 
requisite in backpacks as gorp: Cutter's Insect Repellent and Cutter's Snake 
Bite Kits. 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest of five boys, Ralph spent his first six years on the Cutter 
family's huge ranch, in the rolling oak hills east of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, a devout kayaker, pioneered numerous stretches of California white 
water and chaired the rivers section of her Sierra Club chapter. She and 
Ralph's father -- a successful businessman who created the Medfly trap, among 
other inventions -- regularly dragged their kids into the Sierra on 
horse-packing trips. That wasn't Ralph's only early exposure to fish, though. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring, cutthroat trout battled their way up Bear Creek, from San 
Francisco Bay into the valley spanned by the Cutters' land. Then, when Ralph 
was 6, the utility district forced the family to sell. The dammed creek became 
a reservoir. The spawning run died. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of that incident resurfaced years later, in the vanity plate on 
Cutter's Ford pickup: "BOMADAM." 
</P>
<P>
 Long before he bought that plate, though, there was evidence of riparian 
influence on his life. 
</P>
<P>
 After high school, Cutter migrated through three junior colleges. "I would 
take all the biology courses I could, until they kicked me out. . . . I didn't 
want to be a marine biologist. I wanted to know about stuff that lives in the 
water." 
</P>
<P>
 At Diablo Valley College, in the East Bay, he met Lisa. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time he asked me out, he wanted to go camping," Lisa says. "I said, 
'No, I'd like to get to know you better.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So they went sky diving. 
</P>
<P>
 They married nine months later. For their honeymoon, they loaded up with 
fishing, rock-climbing and camera gear, and set off on a nine-month hike north 
from the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
 They hit the Sierra Nevada in mid-May and began "windshield wipering" their 
way back and forth across the range. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Lisa's first backpacking trip, and a good test of their marriage. In 
the span of one week, they hitchhiked to Bakersfield for supplies and wound up 
sleeping for three nights under a flickering neon sign that read, "Let's Eat!" 
The next day they hiked back into the high country and got caught in a 
homicidal snowstorm that forced them to ration their food. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found a cave and camped in it for five days, counting the number of 
species of lichen on the wall. We had a wonderful time," Cutter says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa recalls the adventure fondly, if less ebulliently: "It was one of those 
experiences that change your life." 
</P>
<P>
 The trip ended near Lake Tahoe, where Cutter worked his way into a job as a 
firefighter and paramedic. Today he puts in 24-hour shifts that leave 240 days 
a year for other pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
 His re-immersion into fishing came in the late '70s, when he and Lisa took a 
class with legendary fly-caster Mel Krieger. 
</P>
<P>
 What impressed Krieger most about Ralph was his "gentle nature." 
</P>
<P>
 It was another quality, however, that pushed Cutter's fusion with fly-fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Ralph gets into something, he goes full force," Lisa says with obvious 
admiration. "He's always been like that. He wants to know everything there is 
to know. He gets totally submerged." 
</P>
<P>
 Cutter explains: "I wanted to learn about how trout see, so I went into the 
computer and found that the best research library was Scripps in La Jolla. I 
went down there and read every paper ever written on trout vision. Then I 
interviewed the people who wrote the papers. I cleaned their minds, sat in 
their classes, went on field trips with them. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 What he learned there, and similar scientific arcana from the fields of 
limnology, hydrology, entomology, morphology and genetics, fill his classes -- 
which move from the classroom to lakes or streams and back again. Such insight 
has also turned his "Sierra Trout Guide" (Frank Amato Publications, 1991) into 
a cult favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, where devotees see a guru, some observers see frivolity -- stunning 
quantities of time and money wasted probing the behavior of dumb creatures that 
will be caught and immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
 But Paul Quinnett, a clinical psychologist in Spokane, Wash., bristles at the 
notion that fly-fishing is an irrational obsession. In his book "Pavlov's 
Trout" (Keokee Co., 1994) he argues that people who fish often enjoy unusually 
good mental health. And guides tend to be happier than most. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who devote themselves to the thing they're most passionate about -- 
artists, athletes -- if they can find a way to make a living at it, that's the 
best possible world." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Cutter limits his guiding to the high Sierra or exotic waters, 
such as the Amazon. Lisa, meanwhile, guides in the Tahoe area several days a 
week, and she and Teal will lead a horse-pack trip for mothers and daughters 
into the Sierra this August. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, students from the city comment that the family's life looks 
perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it weren't," Cutter says, "We'd change it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The epigram to "Sierra Trout Guide's" first chapter is from Izaak Walton's 
1653 classic, "The Compleat Angler": 
</P>
<P>
 "Rivers and the inhabitants of the watery element were made for wise men to 
contemplate and fools to pass by without consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 Walton had nothing to say about folks who actually climb in with the fish. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the Monday after his weekend class, with his students scattered back to 
their lives as oncologists, designers and attorneys, Cutter makes the 
five-minute drive down to a spot where the Truckee River runs alongside an old 
coolie-built railroad abutment. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulling on a dry-suit and air tanks, he sloshes in, disappearing into a 
shattered reflection of brush, trees and blue sky. Inscrutable from the bank, 
the river now becomes the dynamic ecosystem Cutter described in the classroom. 
Crayfish scuttle around submerged rocks. Caddis fly larvae, encased like hermit 
crabs in clusters of pebbles, pulse in the current beside puffy white snail 
eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 And there, flashing across murky pools, or finning calmly beneath a foaming 
riffle, big trout, invisible from above, go about their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past decade, Cutter has spent hundreds of hours snorkeling and scuba 
diving in streams, rivers and lakes. Only from within, he says, can he put the 
finishing touches on his picture of the river realm. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutter's flyers boast that his classes will push students into the ranks of 
"the 10% of anglers who catch 90% of the fish." 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, though, as he reels in more clients than he can handle, he is 
equally intent on releasing them with a new ethic, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching him clip off the whole hook on a hand-tied fly before casting; 
after hearing him argue against the way some angling advocacy groups turn 
rivers into "pee-wee golf courses for fishermen," students may well wonder on 
which side of the water's surface Cutter's true loyalties lie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lisa and I sit and talk about how to approach students," Cutter concedes. "We 
discuss how to teach them how neat fishing is without turning them off by 
talking about Zen, or about how nice it is to go fishing and not catch a fish. 
Until you feel it, and experience it, you'll never understand what I'm trying 
to say. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an art and there's a science to fishing," he continues. "I try to 
teach the science, and I think the art follows. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Very, very often, Lisa and I go fishing -- and never go fishing. We get down 
to the river with our fishing rods, sit down on the bank, and just watch -- 
watch the fish rise, watch the bugs hatch, watch the moon come over the water. 
. . ."

SURGERY STARTS OUTSIDE

newspaper at Canyon High School in Anaheim.

<P>
 Is plastic surgery a miracle of modern technology, or is it better to take 
yourself at face value? Canyon High School students Becky Burton and Leslie 
Larue debate the topic: 
</P>
<P>
 How do you feel about teen-agers having plastic surgery? 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie: I truly feel that teen-age plastic surgery is an external escape 
hiding behind a lack of inner-confidence. Getting something fixed won't solve 
your problem because it's all in your head. 
</P>
<P>
 Becky: Basically, I feel that plastic surgery could help a person's 
self-confidence. If only one imperfection is making them insecure around other 
people, I feel they should just change it. 
</P>
<P>
 L: It seems as though people have become too concerned about their outer 
self-images. What ever happened to personality? Besides, just changing one 
thing about yourself isn't going to solve a self-confidence problem. 
</P>
<P>
 B: If a teen-ager has a long list of things to correct, then yes, there is 
something wrong. But I see no harm in one or two things being changed. . . . If 
you have an attribute that is very noticeable and unattractive, then go have it 
fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 L: The amount of money teens spend on cosmetic surgery is ridiculous. And, 
what if there are complications or it doesn't turn our right? 
</P>
<P>
 B: If a teen doesn't have the money to do it and is skeptical about the 
outcome, then they shouldn't do it. It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks 
about your looks but you. Teen-agers wear makeup daily in the hopes of looking 
better. Plastic surgery is just a more drastic measure to look more beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 L: Then are teens changing to fit society's standards of beauty or their own? 
</P>
<P>
 Are teen-agers hiding their feelings behind the knife? 
</P>
<P>
 B: A plastic surgeon will usually refer teen-agers to a therapist beforehand 
because any physical change is shocking. Teen-agers should go for the therapy 
first. If that doesn't work, then they should change their appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 L: Our society revolves around perfection. We can change anything we want . . 
. soon teens will even be able to change their DNA makeup! We need to get back 
to the basics and return to what we came with. 
</P>
<P>
 If a teen has the money and desire to have plastic surgery, then what's the 
problem? 
</P>
<P>
 L: Because teen-agers are tampering with things they shouldn't be tampering 
with. Teen-agers have to be content with what they were born with and what they 
are naturally given. 
</P>
<P>
 B: All I can say is to each their own and, if a teen-ager wants an alternate 
look, then certainly do it.

 Nine-year-olds are twice as likely to spend free time reading as 17-year-olds, 
according to the American Federation of Teachers.Only 42% of 17-year-olds are 
likely to read a book each week, while 86% of all 9-year-olds read every week. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the discrepancy is that parents are more likely to encourage 
younger children to read.  
</P>
<P>
 An increase in other activities and television watching may be the reason for 
the decline in teen years, the AFT study said. For example, 52% of all teen 
males said they were involved in sports at school or on local leagues. Teen 
females said they spent the most amount of "home time" on the telephone.

THE GOODS; JOY RIDES; FASTER. LOOPIER. ROLLER COASTERS ARE ROARING BACK, GIVING 
FAMILY FUN A LITTLE EDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Forget the Peter Pan ride and the photo op with Snoopy. It's thrill time at 
many amusement parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Roller coasters are back and the battle's on "for the fastest highest scariest 
ride," says Susan Mosedale, spokeswoman for the International Assn. of 
Amusement Parks and Attractions in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 The thrills are also safe, or they wouldn't be amusement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is scary," says UCLA student Andrea White, 23, fresh from riding Six Flags 
Magic Mountain's Viper, which "plastered" her face to her head. "But that's 
what makes you laugh -- because you know nothing's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course not. But when amusements have such names as Raptor, Vortex and Shock 
Wave, and toss people upside-down at 60 m.p.h., you might well ask if the 
fright isn't justified. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rides mark the return of roller coasters in a new high-tech 
incarnation.  
</P>
<P>
 "The golden age of amusement parks was in the '20s and '30s," says Ron Toomer, 
president of Arrow Dynamics in Clearfield, Utah, the country's leading ride 
manufacturer. There were 1,500 wood roller coasters then, compared to 200 or 
300 coasters of all kinds now in the United States, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Depression took its toll, and postwar development took a lot of prime park 
land. In the '50s, Disney resuscitated the park concept with the theme park, 
which is not heavy on thrills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all going for clean, safe family entertainment, modeling ourselves 
after Disneyland," says Robin Innes, spokesman for Cedar Point amusement park 
in Sandusky, Ohio. "That meant a decline of interest in roller coasters." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone prospered. Magic Mountain almost went under trying to compete as 
a park themed with unattractive trolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrill rides came back with a roar and some new twists in the mid '70s. Magic 
Mountain has revived as Southern California's only thrill-ride park with nine 
roller coasters and half a dozen water plunges. Cedar Point, almost razed in 
the '50s, built the largest ride park in the world -- 56 rides, 11 of them 
coasters. 
</P>
<P>
 All coasters, new or old, follow the same principle: You take something up a 
hill and let gravity take it down. The pattern of descent today, however, given 
the flexibility of new tubular steel tracks gripped by multiple nylon wheels, 
provides twists and loops only dreamed of in the days of the Coney Island 
woodie, which plunged down a series of smaller and smaller hills, interspersed 
with long curves and slow climbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The new generation of design was born with Arrow Dynamics' Corkscrew rides for 
Knott's and Cedar Point in 1975 and 1976. Toomer describes these as "a 
pulled-out spiral laying on its side, with two upside-down elements." 
</P>
<P>
 Next came vertical loops with the track running inside, then suspended 
coasters with the seats hanging down below the track, then cobra rolls (a loop 
with twists) and boomerangs, then "inverted" loops with tracks running around 
the outside. Magic Mountain's Viper has three vertical loops, a corkscrew and a 
double-barrel boomerang, turning riders upside-down seven times. 
</P>
<P>
 They're fast -- up to 70 m.p.h. They're also the shortest coaster rides ever, 
about two minutes, sometimes less. They have to rake in the customers -- as 
many as 2,000 riders an hour. After all, Toomer says, "they cost a lot of 
money." And two minutes, he adds, is "about all you can take." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, few people get sick on these thrillers, partly because "it's over so 
quickly," says Jim Seay, Magic Mountain's engineering manager. The ride is 
smooth, given the bendable steel, the speed, the dynamics and the bucket seats 
and over-the-shoulder restraints holding the body in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Some riders find the new coasters less scary than the old. "You're going 
forward so fast, you don't feel like you're falling," says Lionel Johnson, 13, 
of Los Angeles, on a visit to Magic Mountain.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's totally controlled, while the wood ones give you a sense of going down a 
long drop, like you're on your own," says his friend, Nicholas Trikonis, 12.  
</P>
<P>
 Today's coaster aficionados -- and there are several national clubs of fans -- 
can describe the "maximum Gs" or gravity forces of a ride (the pressure that 
pushes riders into their seats, usually while coming out of a trough), or the 
"zero Gs" or weightlessness of another (usually coming off an apex). They have 
fine perceptions. They claim coasters run faster on hot days because their 
lubricants thin out. "You're talking about small amounts of time," Seay says, 
"but the transitions, as you go into a curve, do feel different." 
</P>
<P>
 What you needn't feel is unsafe. Over the two decades from 1973 through 1992, 
94 deaths on all rides, not just coasters, were reported to the U.S. Consumer 
Product Safety Commission, an average of fewer than five a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some accidents were problems of maintenance or operation -- poorly secured 
restraints, colliding cars, inattentive attendants. But others involved what 
CPSC project officer James DeMarco calls "patron error," the unanticipated 
dangerous behavior of riders who were foolish or drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers get some official protection. The CPSC has jurisdiction over mobile 
carnivals, its activity being more oversight than regular inspections, 
particularly in states that regulate carnivals. Fixed-site parks are under 
state jurisdiction, and only some states conduct inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 The state of California does not inspect parks, but some local authorities do. 
Los Angeles County's Department of Public Works, Building and Safety division 
regularly inspects park rides and maintenance. Orange County, site of two major 
parks, Disneyland and Knott's, does not, leaving the industry to self-regulate. 
</P>
<P>
 The big fixed-site parks do self-regulate, whether or not they have thrill 
rides, following, at a minimum, standards set by the American Society for 
Testing and Materials and endorsed by their trade group, the International 
Assn. of Amusement Parks and Attractions. They tend to do a lot more than the 
minimum, not wanting any incidents to mar their records: "The consequence of 
such negative publicity is the biggest insurance of all," says Knott's 
spokesman Bob Ochsner." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, fixed-site coasters are increasingly high-tech installations, 
engineered like high-performance aircraft and operated by computers -- not just 
one, but often two that operate independently, Seay says -- "but both run the 
ride, recognizing where the trains are at any given time, and what they're 
doing. If at any point they disagree, the ride goes into shutdown, although the 
trains continue to a safe stopping point." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Magic Mountain, Seay says, there's extensive self-inspection in addition to 
the county's inspection. Magic Mountain maintenance crews walk tracks before 
the park opens. If the track's unwalkable, they climb the structure at various 
points. Operations people take the first rides. 
</P>
<P>
 Seat restraints are crucial, "ensuring that the rider stays in the right 
position," Seay says. Padded steel tubing comes down over the shoulders; bars 
or belts cross the lap; there are headrests and handholds. Who can ride is 
dictated by height, not age -- commonly a 48-inch minimum (age 6 or 7), 54 
inches for more turbulent rides. Parks warn off pregnant women and people with 
back or heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller children are prohibited, Toomer says, not because they'd fall out, but 
"because the orthopedic guys tell us they don't have the proper neck muscles to 
control their heads." There's also a size maximum on a per-case basis; Earvin 
(Magic) Johnson was taken off Cedar Point's Mine Ride because the lap bar 
couldn't close on him. 
</P>
<P>
 A restraint has to be locked to work; a latch must be secured. And trained 
personnel should be checking that they are before the ride starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Accident reports show children have slipped out of restraints and jumped off 
various rides, including roller coasters. Parents should judge whether their 
children are mature enough to ride and be sure they understand the rules. 
Today's restraints may rein in much rider misbehavior, but the fact is, "if you 
tried hard enough, you could get out," Innes says.

 A group of students at Shasta High School in Redding has formed a 
free-thinkers club for "students who think before they believe." 
</P>
<P>
 Student Derek Trunk said he organized the club to counter a Christian Club on 
campus that he said was "making the students who don't believe in God feel that 
they're doing something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The group was originally called the Shasta Atheists Club but changed the name 
to more accurately reflect members' views. "I'm not an atheist per se; I have 
my own religion," said one member. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Christian Club says it isn't being pushy. "We just go around 
spreading friendship," an organizer said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials say there is room on campus for both groups.

THERE'S NO FIDDLING WITH DEVOTION TO BLUEGRASS; POP MUSIC: MEMBER BYRON BERLINE 
SAYS ASH GROVE'S MEMBERS ARE CASUAL ABOUT SUCCESS, NOT THE MUSIC. THEY'LL 
PERFORM IN HUNTINGTON BEACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It takes commitment in the music world for a band to make it to the top, a 
willingness to go full-tilt and do whatever is necessary to achieve fame. Then 
there is the new bluegrass group Ash Grove, which might be lacking in that 
particular brand of commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, let's just say we're not gonna buy a bus and get uniforms," said 
fiddler Byron Berline with a laugh, when asked how much a go of it he and his 
fellow members were planning to make. 
</P>
<P>
 Ash Grove, rather, came together casually in the San Fernando Valley living 
rooms of its five members, players joined by the mutual sense of fun they have 
playing bluegrass music.  
</P>
<P>
 The group hasn't played in public yet -- that happens for the first time 
Saturday at Montana & Lace Vintage Musical Instruments in Huntington Beach -- 
but there is little doubt there will be an understated yet evident sense of 
commitment along with that fun. Berline and his band-mates have a long-proven 
devotion to the music they're assaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Berline in the band are former Desert Rose Band members Herb Pedersen 
on banjo and Bill Bryson on bass, as well as onetime Kentucky Colonel Billy Ray 
Latham on guitar and Jethro Burns protege Kenny Blackwell on mandolin. 
</P>
<P>
 Berline, who turns 50 next week, made his first recording more than 30 years 
ago as the fiddlin' part of the classic 1963 "Pickin' and Fiddlin' " album by 
the Dillards (Pedersen and Latham also later passed through this outfit). 
</P>
<P>
 In 1967 he joined bluegrass progenitor Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys. Then in 
1969 he moved to Los Angeles and became a participant in the fermenting 
country-rock scene, recording with the Byrds, the Flying Burrito Brothers, the 
Rolling Stones and others. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ash Grove takes its name from the L.A. roots-music club of the same name, a 
focal point for the folk, blues and bluegrass scenes until an arsonist burned 
it down in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us hung out there back in the early days," Berline said. "Between the 
Ash Grove and the Troubadour it was really hopping back in those days. We'll 
hopefully bring back a lot of memories with these guys in the band, because 
we've all lived through those times, and there's a lot of history there. I 
guess you only have to get old enough, and people say, 'Gosh, those guys go way 
back don't they?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The songs certainly go way back, including a number of Bill Monroe, Osborne 
Brothers and Flatt & Scruggs tunes, along with some gospel and a cappella 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Berline and the other band members are all neighbors who started playing the 
music at their homes for fun before they considered taking it public. Though 
most of them have played some huge venues and festivals, the places they'll be 
playing, such as the 30-seat Huntington Beach show, won't be much bigger than 
their living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to play bluegrass, you can't get too particular," Berline 
said, noting it's not the most popular of music styles. The ideal isn't 
audience size and prestige, but attracting the small but engaged listening 
audiences that go to places such as the Montana shop or Laguna Niguel's Shade 
Tree Stringed Instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy just to find venues that we can play and enjoy, so it's still fun 
just to get together and do this. If we really wanted to push this to a real 
big level, we'd probably go about things a little differently. But we're not 
concerned with that at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Berline's other band, California, is still very much a going concern, he said. 
(With Orange County guitarist Dan Crary and others, California is a 
continuation of a band they started in the '70s called Sundance). 
</P>
<P>
 Although that outfit is known to mix styles and influences a bit, Berline 
said, "Ash Grove is much more traditional sounding, really trying to capture 
the sound of the way the music was done years ago, although with our own 
styles. I like doing both. It's fun doing traditional things in the old-time 
way, but, gosh, it's fun to do other things, too." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As one might surmise of a guy who says "gosh" this much, Berline isn't from 
these parts originally. He was born in Oklahoma, and got his first earful of 
fiddling from his father. 
</P>
<P>
 He later was influenced by the Texas fiddlers his father took him to hear, and 
he didn't really get the bluegrass bug until he was in college, on a football 
scholarship at the University of Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 It was there that he met the Dillards after a campus performance, and the 
group was so impressed with his playing they asked him to join. A couple of 
years later, his fiddling had a similarly immediate effect on Bill Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
 He hadn't heard much rock when growing up. "My dad was a strict Grand Ole Opry 
guy, and that's pretty much all we'd ever have on," Berline said. 
</P>
<P>
 His introduction to the rock world was a fairly auspicious one. In 1969 he was 
still residing in Oklahoma when he got a phone call, and the next thing he knew 
he was on a jet to Los Angeles to record with the Rolling Stones. He's featured 
on "Country Honk" on the "Let It Bleed" album, along with car horns and other 
traffic noise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd gone through the tune a few times when they got the bright idea to put me 
out on the street, on the sidewalk, and record me there. There was some 
construction going on, so Mick Jagger himself had to go out and stop this 
bulldozer from pushing dirt so we could record." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the Stones, the likes of the Doors and Leon Russell were also 
hanging around the studio, not that Berline was particularly impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me it was just 'Oh, well,' because I wasn't a big groupie-fan. I was just 
a country fiddler from Oklahoma, and the Rolling Stones weren't part of my 
world. When they had called me up in Oklahoma to get me out there it was the 
middle of the night. They said, 'Hey, man, this is so-and-so from the Stones.' 
I said, 'Yeah, I know you're stoned. Now who is this?' 'No, the Rolling 
Stones.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Berline had already planned to move to L.A. to work on a project with Doug 
Dillard, and he did make the move shortly after the Stones' session.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was amazing here then. All the groups were out here trying to make a go of 
it, and there was a big country scene also. The record companies were signing 
people left and right, and everybody was experimenting. The Byrds and Burritos 
came around experimenting with country rock, and more people jumped on that. It 
was great timing for me to come out here then." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he took readily to the musical experimentation, he was more cautious 
with his lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "In '69 it was pretty crazy, everybody experimenting with music, the drugs and 
so forth," he said. "As you can imagine coming in from Oklahoma -- even though 
I'd gone to the university there -- boy, it was amazing out here, very 
exciting. Everybody was out here: the big stars and the movie industry, which I 
also got involved in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was all so much more than I thought it would be. Luckily I stayed away 
from the drugs. I did my share of beer drinking but that's about it, and I've 
given that up too." 
</P>
<P>
 As an experienced fiddler young enough to be open to new ideas, Berline had 
the opportunity to record with the Byrds, the Burritos, Gram Parsons, Bob 
Dylan, the Band, Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt, the late Henry Mancini and a 
host of others. 
</P>
<P>
 And like seemingly every sideman of the '70s, he also got the urge to "do his 
own thing" with his own band. He and other like-minded pickers formed Country 
Gazette and got signed to United Artists.  
</P>
<P>
 The acoustic group's albums may have featured some solid tradition-rooted 
picking, but you'd scarcely know it by the covers. One, "Traitor in Our Midst," 
had a fold-out cover with a comic strip-like photo story featuring the band in 
weird banditos-in-drag get-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 "That wasn't our idea," he insisted. "They spent more money on that cover than 
they did recording the whole album." 
</P>
<P>
 The album cover also features Berline in a Tarzan outfit. It's not his 
proudest moment, but it has provided him with some fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hired to teach Arnold Schwarzenegger to look like he could play the 
fiddle in his first major movie, 'Stay Hungry.' " Berline also wound up doing 
the score for the 1976 Bob Rafelson flick. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came over for me to give him a lesson, and I showed him this album cover 
and said, 'Now here's a real bodybuilder.' He got a big kick out of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Berline has always been able to support himself and his family with his music, 
but it's required a fair amount of diversification. Along with his own musical 
projects, a solo CD and the two bands he now is part of, he is still a sideman 
on other performers' recordings (he recently worked with Matthew Sweet on a 
song for a Carpenters' tribute album), and he lends his talents to the demo 
tapes of aspiring artists.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He does TV and movie dates, with recent credits including "Northern Exposure" 
and "Maverick." He occasionally appears in films, though another of his jobs -- 
conducting music clinics -- recently precluded his appearance in an upcoming 
Jeff Bridges film about Wild Bill Hickock. 
</P>
<P>
 He's written columns for music magazines, and has put out instructional tapes 
and videos. He takes a novel approach to the latter: Rather than have a single 
generalized instructional video, Berline records his tapes on request. 
Customers will ask for specific songs, "and I'll just make a video here in the 
house and send it to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, I'll keep a copy of each one, because I don't want to have to do 
'Orange Blossom Special' 100 times. I've been doing real well with this and am 
the only one doing it as far as I know." (Fiddle fanatics can call (818) 
986-3791 regarding Berline's videos.) 
</P>
<P>
 Along with all the other hats he wears, Berline also is a cultural ambassador, 
a designation bestowed on him and the group California by the U.S. State 
Department. They have represented American culture on tours of Northern Africa 
and the South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as we got to play for the locals it was great," he said, "not just 
the ambassadors and all their parties." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a sad state of affairs that he can get gigs in Tonga and Samoa, but not 
so many here at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came out here people supported every kind of music, but the music 
scene has changed just so drastically. Now, as big as the Los Angeles area is, 
for bluegrass and acoustic music there are not too many places I've found that 
will support it anymore, just some of these little stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you know, it's the same way all over," he said. "I talk to people all 
over the United States, and they all say it's the same."

 Clashing sharply with Capitol Hill's customary pomp and circumstance, two 
Seattle grunge-rockers took center stage before a House panel Thursday to 
accuse Ticketmaster of maintaining an illegal monopoly over the concert ticket 
distribution business. 
</P>
<P>
 The appearance of Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard and bass player Jeff Ament 
at a House Governmental Operations subcommittee hearing drew a throng of 
curious congressional interns lining the halls outside the hearing room, which 
was packed with entertainment paparazzi. 
</P>
<P>
 The band, which has filed an antitrust complaint with the Justice Department 
against Los Angeles-based Ticketmaster, alleges that the company is violating 
federal law by controlling ticket prices and blocking new entrants to the 
distribution business. 
</P>
<P>
 Gossard and Ament, speaking on behalf of the five-member group, said an 
absence of competition has allowed Ticketmaster to tack exorbitant service fees 
onto the base price of concert tickets. Justice Department officials have 
launched a probe into the matter and are expected to testify before the House 
panel next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is almost impossible for a band to do a tour of large arenas or other 
significant venues in major cities and not deal with Ticketmaster," said 
Gossard, resplendent in a peach-colored shirt and blue velvet shorts.  
</P>
<P>
 Gossard said Pearl Jam had planned a coast-to-coast summer tour and wanted to 
cap the cost of concert tickets at $18. But the band members canceled the tour 
after realizing they could not prevent Ticketmaster from tacking on service 
fees that would increase the price substantially. 
</P>
<P>
 Gossard and Ament, who were joined at the hearing by managers of other rock 
bands, said they have become increasingly wary of Ticketmaster's control over 
pricing since the Justice Department allowed the company to buy Ticketron, its 
main competitor, in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticketmaster's chief executive, Fred Rosen, told subcommittee members that his 
company faces a "highly competitive" marketplace and takes in an average of 
only 10 cents for every ticket sold. Ticketmaster recorded profits of about 
$7.5 million last year, according to financial statements released at the 
hearing. The firm's share accounts for only a small fraction of combined 
national ticket sales of 1.5 billion tickets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under exclusive contracts with venue owners, Ticketmaster's service fees can 
add between $4 and $8 to the cost of admission. Gossard said the charges 
provide revenue to promoters and venues in an "incestuous relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all of us support lower ticket prices," said Rosen, who also 
distributed a written statement dismissing the band's antitrust memorandum to 
the Justice Department as "a work of fiction." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pearl Jam members were easy to spot in a hearing room full of gray suits 
and wing-tip shoes. Ament showed up wearing an army-green combat jacket and a 
Seattle Supersonics cap perched backward on his head. Both band members giggled 
during their swearing-in.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think you're just darling guys," said Rep. Lynn Woolsey (D-Petaluma), who 
warned that "the music won't rock if consumers get rolled." 
</P>
<P>
 The adulation was not universal, though. At one point, Gossard and Ament 
engaged in a heated exchange with Rep. Steve Horn (R-Long Beach), one of the 
few Republicans to attend the session. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn tried to inquire whether the band had exclusive contracts with its 
manager or its record label, but Gossard cut him short, saying, "I find your 
line of questioning very strange. This is about whether Ticketmaster has a 
monopoly." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Gary Condit (D-Ceres), chairman of the subcommittee, declined to discuss 
possible legislative intervention, preferring to await the results of the 
Justice Department inquiry. If Ticketmaster is found to be breaking the law, he 
said, "it would be incumbent on us" to consider changes in antitrust law. 
</P>
<P>
 Several music industry representatives at the hearing, including Aerosmith 
manager Tim Collins, urged Congress to impose new regulations on the ticket 
distribution industry.

NEW STATION AIMS TO GIVE POP FANS A CHOICE; RADIO: FM 101.9 CHANGES ITS FORMAT 
TODAY FROM EASY-LISTENING MUSIC TO AN ECLECTIC MIX KNOWN AS 'TRIPLE A.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A new station will be hitting the Los Angeles airwaves today, playing an 
eclectic mix of contemporary rock artists and singer-songwriters with a 
smattering of folk, soul, blues, reggae and world music in a broadcasting style 
that hearkens back to the spirit of progressive, underground rock radio of the 
'60s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 The station will replace the easy-listening KLIT-FM and be located at 101.9 on 
the dial. (The station is currently in the midst of developing new call 
letters.)  
</P>
<P>
 The format of the station is known in the radio industry as "Triple A, " or 
"Adult Album Alternative" rock, and there are a growing number -- about 50 -- 
of these stations cropping up around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best way to describe this is radio that has the spirit of early FM radio 
but sort of redefined for the '90s -- adventurous, exciting, with a passion for 
music and a curiosity about new music," said the station's program director 
Mike Morrison. "It won't be stuck in the past, not playing a bunch of old songs 
around in the '70s. There are hundreds of artists that are accepted by music 
fans around the world that are among the best making music today that don't get 
any radio exposure. We'll be giving them plenty of exposure." 
</P>
<P>
 Examples of some of the new station's core artists who get little or no 
exposure in Los Angeles include John Hiatt, Indigo Girls, Seal, Richard 
Thompson, Toad the Wet Sprocket, Cheryl Crow, Tori Amos and Shawn Colvin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than playing it safe and avoiding unfamiliar sounds and artists that 
might be sort of alienating to the average person on the first listen, we'll 
seek that stuff out," said Morrison, who will also be a deejay at the station. 
"With virtually every other radio station being as predictable as night and 
day, Triple A is unpredictable: It's diverse, you never know what you're going 
to hear next." 
</P>
<P>
 The station will also play a fuller repertoire of music by alternative or 
classic rockers whose airplay is currently limited to their big hits. Some 
examples of those include Los Lobos, Van Morrison, R.E.M., Counting Crows, the 
Cure, Elvis Costello and Tom Petty. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past couple of decades, radio station owners have played it safe, 
relying on research compiled by consultants to determine what music they will 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as the consultants took over in the late '70s and research became the 
primary tool for choosing music, gut and passion for music fell by the wayside 
and FM radio became very boring," the station's Morrison said. "When we play 
bigger names like Van Morrison or Elvis Costello or Bonnie Raitt, we won't be 
like the other stations playing three or four of their songs, the well-known 
songs. We'll be tapping the vast libraries of their magnificent music." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first new contemporary rock format since the station attempted an 
alternative-oriented mix known as "the Edge" five years ago. The format was on 
the air only five months with virtually no promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Then-program director and on-air personality) J.J. Jackson convinced 
(station management) to experiment a bit, but they were not behind the Edge," 
said Morrison. "This is a different story. They are 100% committed to this 
format. The Edge was a little bit before its time." 
</P>
<P>
 The station, which is owned by Gene Autry's Golden West Broadcasters, had 
ranked 31st in the most recent Arbitron ratings, so it has almost nowhere else 
to go but up, say station officials. Still, they don't expect this format to be 
the most popular in the city, but to attract a strong, loyal following, with 
plenty of discretionary income to attract advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
 The target audience for FM 101.9 ranges from 25-49, with greatest emphasis on 
baby boomers from 30-44, said General Manager Bill Ward. 
</P>
<P>
 "The demographic it appeals to is one that advertisers find very appealing for 
their education and financial status," said Kid Leo, who developed progressive 
radio in Cleveland in the '70s and is now vice president of album promotion for 
Columbia Records. "Even if the station only gets a certain level of success, 
those people are the ones that advertisers really want to get to." 
</P>
<P>
 Because it will provide the only Los Angeles outlet for many artists and 
musical styles, record executives are excited about the advent of Triple A in 
the nation's top media market. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to be a ton of support from record companies because a lot of 
our artists have not gotten exposure in L.A.," said Atlantic Records' promotion 
manager Bonnie Slifkin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exciting, a format that hasn't been around for a while and from the old 
deejay standpoint we need to have announcers associated with music again," said 
Leo. "You have Howard Stern and the morning shows around the country that have 
nothing to do with music. These (Triple A) announcers believe in music." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Leo has more than memories at stake in the station's success -- he 
has records to sell. The potential audience for FM 101.9 he says, is 
tailor-made for several of his artists, including Shawn Colvin, Harry Connick 
Jr. and singer-songwriter Jeff Buckley. 
</P>
<P>
 Colvin (whose new album, "Cover Girl," will be released in August) responded 
to the news of the station's advent with enthusiasm. "I love listening to 
Triple A, so that's the best news about L.A. getting a station," she said, 
adding, "No, the best news is that they'll play me."  
</P>
<P>
 Leo's list of his Triple A artists covers a fairly wide spectrum. So does that 
of Atlantic Records executives Andrea Ganis and Slifkin, ranging from young 
alternative folk group Frente to singer-songwriter Tori Amos and country 
maverick Jim Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
 But all those artists have two things in common: Before the advent of Triple A 
they had skirted the existing radio formats and found airplay hard to come by, 
and their fans fit into the prized baby boomer demographic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Intelligent thirtysomething people want to discover new music badly," said 
Will Botwin, who manages John Hiatt (whose "Perfectly Good Guitar" was the 
top-played album on Triple A stations in 1993), Los Lobos and Rosanne Cash -- 
all artists who have tended to fall between radio's cracks in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 But will a new station get the attention of those listeners in 
sensory-overloaded L.A.? 
</P>
<P>
 "In a city this size they'll have to make some noise about coming in," says 
Bruce Tennenbaum, MCA Records' senior vice president of promotion. "You're 
talking about an older demographic, so you have to go into their homes and get 
their attention and make sure they're not just watching 'NYPD Blue.' "

SHILEY INC. SETTLES FALSE-CLAIMS SUIT; COURTS: IRVINE-BASED FIRM AND ITS PARENT 
AGREE TO PAY $10.75 MILLION TO U.S. IN CASE INVOLVING FLAWED ARTIFICIAL HEART 
VALVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE MICHAUD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Heart-valve maker Shiley Inc. and its parent, Pfizer Inc., have agreed to pay 
the federal government $10.75 million to settle accusations that they made 
false claims about the potentially fatal artificial valves it manufactured from 
1979 to 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement amount is what the government estimates it paid for the valves 
and valve-related treatments through its health insurance programs, Medicare 
and the Veterans Health Administration, multiplied by 2 1/2 times, an amount 
determined in lieu of penalties. This civil suit against Shiley and Pfizer was 
brought under the False Claims Act and under common law, which allow the 
government to recoup damages and penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 The valve was implanted in about 83,000 heart patients worldwide. At least 250 
people died when the tiny struts that held their valves together snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Shiley agreed to pay the federal agencies for future medical 
costs related to the valves, for an estimated total of $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "This agreement represents a landmark settlement," Assistant U.S. Atty. Gen. 
Frank Hunger said in a statement. "It is significant that a company accused of 
false representations to the government has been held accountable not only for 
its statements but also for medical costs." 
</P>
<P>
 The companies admitted no liability in settling the case and said they did so 
to put the litigation behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Litigation is tremendously distracting and time-consuming, and it keeps us 
from the real issues at hand," said Bob Fauteux, spokesman for Irvine-based 
Shiley. He said the company has committed to spending $75 million to, among 
other things, research diagnostic techniques that would help determine which 
implanted valves are likely to crack. 
</P>
<P>
 Shiley settled last September with 259 valve recipients, for an undisclosed 
amount. Those close to the case estimated the settlement to be worth $26 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 other lawsuits remain unsettled, as well as a federal court 
appeal of a 1992 class-action settlement in Cincinnati, which includes all 
83,000 Shiley heart valve recipients around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately on Thursday, Shiley announced that it would spend an undetermined 
amount to reimburse third-party payers -- insurance companies and, in Europe, 
government health agencies -- for their costs to replace the valves when 
surgery is approved by a doctor. The agreement complements the provisions of 
the class action settlement, Fauteux said. 
</P>
<P>
 The valve, called the Bjork-Shiley convexo-concave valve, was approved for 
sale by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1979. Faced with negative 
publicity, the company pulled it off the market in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunger argued that the valve's FDA approval was based on false statements made 
by Shiley. Later, the company made further false statements to keep the 
mechanical valve on the market, Hunger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Shiley initially told the FDA that the valve caused less blood 
clotting than others on the market. The government said the Shiley valve's 
performance advantage was much smaller than the company represented. In 
addition, Shiley failed to provide the FDA with all the information it 
possessed concerning fractures of valves. Eighteen had fractured during 
prototype testing, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fracture problem became evident, Shiley argued to the FDA that the 
Bjork-Shiley valve should remain on the market because its purported 
blood-clotting advantage outweighed the threat to people's lives posed by the 
risk of fracture. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the government contended that Shiley's manufacturing process was 
considerably flawed. It said that scrap valves were rebuilt, valves were 
re-welded an excessive number of times, and cracked valve struts were polished 
rather than re-welded.

JOB-TRAINING COMPANY FILES 2ND SUIT AGAINST UAW AFFILIATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rands Systems Inc., an Orange County job-training firm, has filed a second 
lawsuit against the UAW-Labor Employment and Training Corp., a nonprofit 
statewide organization that counsels, trains and helps people find jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rands, formerly a subcontractor to UAW-Labor Employment and Training, claims 
in its latest suit that UAW-Labor Employment's president, Patricia Williams, 
interfered with Rands' effort to obtain a contract of its own from the 
Employment Training Panel, a state job-development agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that Williams, who is a member of the eight-person Employment 
Training Panel, cast the deciding vote against Rands' proposal, and as such had 
a conflict of interest. The suit was filed late last week in state Superior 
Court in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The UAW-Labor Employment and Training Corp., based in Bell, called Rands' suit 
"spurious." In a statement, UAW-Labor Employment said Williams had no conflict 
in voting on Rands' proposal because the outcome of that vote would not have 
affected any contract proposals of UAW-Labor Employment. 
</P>
<P>
 UAW-Labor Employment also said an earlier suit filed by Rands in Orange County 
Superior Court was "wholly without merit." In that previous suit, Rands alleged 
UAW-Labor Employment owed it at least $1.5 million for worker training it did 
as a subcontractor. Without elaborating, the suit also claimed that UAW-Labor 
Employment "intentionally placed ineligible job trainees" in state-funded 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 However, UAW-Labor Employment said it has met all of it obligations under the 
subcontract with Rands. UAW-Labor Employment also said it has never received 
state funds related to the placement of any ineligible participants, nor has it 
ever sought to place ineligible workers. On the contrary, the organization 
said, it has placed 1,700 participants into jobs from the state contracts at 
issue with Rands.

BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE SUES HILL WILLIAMS FIRM; INVESTING: SUIT SEEKS RETURN OF $89 
MILLION PLUS PUNITIVE DAMAGES ON BEHALF OF THOUSANDS OF INVESTORS. STATE CALLED 
IT 'A CLASSIC PONZI SCHEME.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Donald Hill Williams' now-bankrupt investment company conspired with its 
attorneys, accountants and brokers to fraudulently raise $89 million in 
investor funds that subsequently were misappropriated, according to a lawsuit 
filed this week in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed Wednesday by the bankruptcy trustee representing four limited 
partnerships with several thousand investors, seeks return of the $89 million 
plus unspecified punitive damages in connection with the February, 1993, 
failure of Anaheim-based Hill Williams Development Co. 
</P>
<P>
 State regulators last year said Williams operated "a classic Ponzi scheme" by 
using new investors' funds to pay off previously incurred obligations. Hill 
Williams' various real estate development deals attracted thousands of 
investors, many of whom pumped money into several different funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleges that only $5 million of investors' funds made its way into 
real estate projects. The rest, according to the suit, went to pay "opulent" 
salaries at Hill Williams, hefty commissions and fees for the company's agents, 
affiliated brokers, attorneys and accountants, and to pay obligations to other 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was unavailable for comment on Thursday. Attorney William C. Starrett 
II said that Williams is still living in Southern California, but that 
"unfortunately, because of all the broad allegations, he's been unable to find 
suitable work." 
</P>
<P>
 Starrett also maintained that his client did not engage in fraudulent activity 
at Hill Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was not named as a party in the suit filed Wednesday because he 
previously filed for personal bankruptcy. Disputed claims generated by 
Williams' personal bankruptcy filing could be settled in a trial scheduled to 
begin later this year, Starrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 The week's suit filed by attorney Ronald Rus in Irvine on behalf of trustee 
Charles W. Daff lists six pages of defendants, including Hill Williams 
executives Charles R. Roundtree, Jeff Rowerdink, Lawrence V. Dorn II, Richard 
F. Dickerson and Marvin L. Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that fraudulent actions at the failed company occurred in 
concert with David A. Colton's Irvine-based investment firms; Goodrich & 
Goodyear & Hinds, the company's accounting firm in Long Beach, and Higham, 
McConnell & Dunning, Hill Williams' Laguna Niguel-based law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for the law firm and the accounting firm did not return telephone 
calls on Thursday. Colton also could not be reached Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit maintains that the accounting firm fraudulently approved transfers of 
$75 million in investor loans from the limited partnerships to Hill Williams 
Development Corp., and failed to alert investors that Williams was running a 
Ponzi scheme. The suit also alleges that "a reasonable attorney" should have 
known that Williams was operating a Ponzi scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that Colton played a key role in "perpetrating the illegal 
and fraudulent schemes." Colton, the suit alleges, occasionally served as a 
"tour guide" on bus trips that were designed to show investors that the 
company's ill-fated real estate developments in Southern California were on 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also alleges that dozens of investment firms in Southern California 
fraudulently used their "relationship of friendship and/or trust and 
confidence" to steer investors into the dubious investments.

MAY FORECLOSURE RATE DROPS 4.4% FROM SAME PERIOD IN '93; REAL ESTATE: DEFAULTS 
OR NOTICES OF IMPENDING ACTION AFFECTED 2,004 HOMES LOCALLY COMPARED TO 2,097 
DURING PREVIOUS MAY, ACCORDING TO INFORMATION SERVICE. ANALYSTS EXPECT RATE TO 
STABILIZE.

<P>
 Orange County's home foreclosure rate dropped 4.4% in May compared to the same 
month a year earlier, according to a monthly survey by Dataquick Information 
Systems in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders foreclosed on or filed notices of default -- the first step in a 
foreclosure proceeding -- on 2,004 homes in Orange County during May, compared 
to 2,097 homes in May 1993, the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate analysts generally expect the foreclosure rate to stabilize in 
1994 as the overall economy gradually recovers. However, the reduced activity 
in May does not necessarily signal a trend. 
</P>
<P>
 The slight decrease doesn't make up for an escalation in county foreclosures 
earlier this year. Orange County's foreclosure rate rose 4.4% in the first five 
months of 1994 compared to the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate survey of both commercial and home foreclosure rates in Orange 
County by TRW Redi Property Data indicates that foreclosures were up 29.2% for 
the first five months of 1994 compared to the same period a year earlier. That 
compares to a 85% increase from 1992 to 1993 for the same five-month period, 
and a 110% increase from 1991 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers differ from the Dataquick survey, because TRW counts actual 
foreclosures of commercial and residential properties while Dataquick's review 
of residential foreclosures includes the notices of default, all of which do 
not result in actual foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rate of increase of foreclosures is slowing down in Orange County," said 
Nima Nattagh, an analyst for TRW in Riverside. "That is the best news we can 
get out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders foreclosed on 5,112 homes in Orange County from January through May of 
this year, compared to 4,894 in the same period last year, according to the 
Dataquick survey. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, foreclosures rose 2.2% to 37,385 in the same period, 
and throughout the state the foreclosure rate is up 7% to 52,731. 
</P>
<P>
 However, one sign of economic recovery is evident. The statewide foreclosure 
rate slowed in May to 10,155, down 12% from a year earlier and down 7.1% from 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald L. Cohn, chief executive of Dataquick, said the year-over-year decline 
in the state during May was the first drop in the foreclosure rate since it 
began climbing sharply two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now the economy is turning around, and home prices are much more stable 
than they have been during the past couple of years," Cohn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreclosure rate is a lagging indicator that shows signs of economic 
distress as much as a year in the past. Foreclosures rise when owners owe more 
on a property than its market value. 
</P>
<P>
 The current slowdown in foreclosure activity is most noticeable in Southern 
California, Dataquick reported, but foreclosure rates are still twice as high 
in Southern California than in other parts of the state. Home and Commercial 
Foreclosures 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders are foreclosing on more properties this year than last, continuing a 
four-year climb. The 2,532 foreclosures during the first five months of this 
year is a 29% increase from last year's 1,960 during the same period. The 
comparable totals for 1992 and 1991 were 1,059 and 504, respectively.

BRIEFCASE: TRAVEL AND TOURISM; AMERICAN AIRLINES DROPS 1 ROUND-TRIP FLIGHT TO 
SAN JOSE 
</P>

<P>
 American Airlines has shaken up its flight schedule at John Wayne Airport, 
even without the entry of Reno Air to take over some of its unprofitable 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
 American dropped one of its round-trip flights to San Jose Thursday, leaving 
the carrier with five on the daily schedule.That was the same route that Reno 
Air had planned to assume this week before a tiff developed between the airport 
and federal regulators about the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it planned to give up the route, American reassigned its San Jose 
planes to other routes around the country. As a result, there will be only 
three flights on the Orange County-San Jose route in July, but that number 
increases to five in August, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, American has been adding flights into its national long-haul 
hubs--the airports where it feeds passengers to make connecting flights. It 
added another flight to Dallas on Thursday, for a total of seven. Starting Aug. 
1, American plans to add two additional daily flights to Chicago for a total of 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
 American spokesman John Hotard said that the company is trying to concentrate 
on longer flights because they are more profitable than the short hauls. 
Southwest Airlines began service at John Wayne last month, slashing existing 
fares by almost half to $69 one way to San Jose and Oakland, a trend that is 
expected to continue.

 Cargo Flights: An environmental impact report on the potential problems caused 
by adding two daily jet freight flights at John Wayne Airport has found minimal 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
 John Wayne doesn't allow cargo flights at present.United Parcel Service and 
Federal Express have both indicated they would be interested in operating from 
there, saving their Orange County delivery trucks from having to drive to the 
Long Beach or Ontario airports. Many of their customers love the idea, because 
it would give them pickup times later than mid-afternoon for overnight 
shipments. 
</P>
<P>
 But since John Wayne has limited its number of flights, the fear was that the 
addition of each cargo flight would result in one less landing slot for a 
passenger flight. Those potential passengers instead would have to seek flights 
from other area airports. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, paid for by UPS, found that two daily cargo flights would cause no 
major increase in either noise from the Boeing 757s that would be used, or 
pollution or traffic tie-ups from airline passengers heading to other airports. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the report appears to favor air cargo, it won't be until next year 
that landing slots at the popular airfield could become available.

County locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers also are no longer going to be charged for receiving facsimile 
copies starting today. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes are the result of research into the needs of traveling business 
executives and what they want from a hotel, Marriott officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "By implementing these changes, we are helping them to do their job better 
while traveling," said Dave Babich, Western regional director.

ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS: ADVANCED LOGIC EXPECTS TO POST LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Advanced Logic Research Inc., a maker of personal computers, reported Thursday 
that it expects to report a net loss of less than $1.5 million for its third 
fiscal quarter ended June 30. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be 
slightly higher than the $36.1 million the company reported for the same period 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it expects to report final results in the last week of July. 
Gene Lu, chief executive of the Irvine-based firm, said he was disappointed 
with the third-quarter results, but he hopes new products will allow the 
company to regain its revenue momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 For the nine months, the company expects to report revenues of $135 million, 
compared to $122.5 million for the same period a year earlier. The net loss for 
the nine months is expected to be less than $700,000, the company said, 
compared to a loss of $5.8 million a year earlier.

TRAFFIC ACCIDENT TESTERS TO STUDY FATE OF PREGNANT WOMEN; SAFETY: EVEN 
LOW-SPEED CRASHES CAN THREATEN THE HEALTH OF AN UNBORN CHILD. IT'S AN 
UNEXPLORED AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE McKESSON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several thousand American women are involved in traffic accidents each year 
while pregnant, and even low-speed crashes can threaten the health of an unborn 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 With that fact in mind, researchers from General Motors Corp. and the 
University of Michigan have developed a "pregnant" test dummy to measure how 
crashes affect mothers-to-be and fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one (a pregnant woman) is probably the last member of the family to be 
studied in crash tests," David Viano, a biomedical engineer who is principal 
research scientist for GM, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The company already runs tests with dummies that simulate infants, 3- and 
6-year-olds, and adults of various sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 The new member of the crash-test family is a modified version of a 
state-of-the-art female dummy. She's 4-foot-11, 110 pounds and in her seventh 
month of pregnancy. Inside is a simulated 7-month fetus suspended in urethane 
gel that mimics amniotic fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 "The toughest thing is looking at what happens to the placenta in a motor 
vehicle crash," said Dr. Mark Pearlman, assistant professor of obstetrics and 
gynecology at Michigan and Viano's partner in the research. "A majority of the 
pregnancy losses in minor crashes is caused by . . . the separation of the 
placenta from the uterus." 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists don't completely understand what causes that to happen, but when it 
does happen, it deprives the fetus of oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
 By adding sophisticated sensing devices to the pregnant dummy, they hope to 
find a way to measure forces that affect the placenta in a crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've started refining the dummy tummy," Pearlman said. "The real question 
becomes: What is the safest restraint system for the pregnancy itself?" 
</P>
<P>
 His answer today is emphatic: "It is clear that safety belts save lives. It's 
also clear that when you compare pregnant women who buckle and those that do 
not, those who buckle suffer fewer injuries in crashes." 
</P>
<P>
 Research with the pregnant crash dummy will help engineers develop safety 
systems specifically designed for pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
 "My suspicion is the whole occupant restraint system hasn't really been 
optimized for pregnant women," Viano said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laboratory crash tests with the prototype dummy began about two weeks ago. "We 
want to use the first set of data to reinforce the advice on proper use of 
belts," Viano said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearlman, Viano and the physician group agree on that advice: Pregnant women 
should wear the lap portion of safety belts as low as possible, under the 
abdomen's bulge. The shoulder portion should be worn between the breasts and 
off to the side of the bulge. 
</P>
<P>
 In the upcoming tests, a sled on a track will be crashed carrying the dummy in 
several configurations: unbelted, belted improperly, belted properly and with 
and without air bags. 
</P>
<P>
 There is substantial research that shows air bags reduce injuries in certain 
crash conditions, Pearlman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's every indication that the same would be true for a pregnant woman," 
he said. "But because there are rare instances when people are injured by air 
bags, it's appropriate for us to do testing with the dummy tummy."

 You know the commercial.  
</P>
<P>
 Two beautiful teen-agers -- with sleek, well-toned bodies -- meet at the beach 
and fall in love over a can of soda. How often have you watched that commercial 
and thought, "If only I had a body like that, my troubles would melt into 
oblivion"? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you are munching potato chips and drinking the advertised soda as that 
thought drifts through your head. You shrug and return to the TV, convinced 
that no matter how hard you tried, you would never look like they do. 
</P>
<P>
 While it's true that none of us will ever look just like the teens in the 
commercial -- we were each born with our individual genetic makeup -- it is 
also true that there is much each person can do to affect his or her physical 
fitness. 
</P>
<P>
 For many body- and health-conscious teens, exercise has become an important 
part of their lives.  
</P>
<P>
 "Most teen-agers aren't really happy with their bodies, so working out makes 
them feel better about themselves," says Julie Deschenes, a student at El 
Modena High School in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 People who are heavyset are often ridiculed on campus and in the media, and 
most teens don't want to endure that ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
 As Christy Vollmer, a June graduate of Huntington Beach High School, says: "I 
want to stay fit because of society's pressure. I don't want to get fat." 
</P>
<P>
 Body image is not the only reason teens are choosing to exercise. For many, 
exercise allows them to clear their heads and vent their frustrations.  
</P>
<P>
 "Working out is a way to relieve myself from stress," says Mary Lou Soot, a 
student at El Modena High School. "It keeps me sane and helps my 
self-confidence. I like amazing myself, pushing myself to the limit to see how 
far I can go."  
</P>
<P>
 Physically fit people are less likely to have serious health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a desire to keep myself in shape. I've seen people who are not in 
shape who have medical problems. I don't want to end up like that," El Modena 
student Garrett Kerr says. 
</P>
<P>
 Student athletes often exercise in the off-season to increase their 
competitive chances next season. Vicki Crookshanks, who runs track at Santa 
Margarita High School in Rancho Santa Margarita, runs distance during the 
off-season to increase her stamina. Page Kishiyama, a wrestler at El Modena, 
builds his muscles during the off-season in an attempt to "intimidate" other 
wrestlers on the mats. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Some exercise-minded teens have memberships in gyms or fitness centers, giving 
them access to weights, aerobic classes, step machines, stationary bikes and 
treadmills. Members usually combine weight training with cardiovascular 
training, and many participate in aerobic classes, saying the dance-like 
routines help break the monotony of individual workouts.  
</P>
<P>
 While there are advantages to belonging to a fitness club, there is one 
glaring drawback -- the cost. The price of membership is more than many teens 
on limited budgets can afford. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not necessary to set foot inside a gym to achieve physical fitness. 
Bicycling and hiking allow you to enjoy nature and get in shape at the same 
time. Exercise videos (about $20) are an inexpensive substitute for aerobic 
classes, and many are aimed at particular "trouble spots" of the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever their reasons for giving it a try, teens are finding the benefits of 
exercise in an improved build, better health and increased peace of mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Exercise alone is not the key to physical fitness, though.  
</P>
<P>
 A healthy diet is necessary for healing and "feeding" developing muscles, 
according to Thomas Hollins, a fitness counselor and trainer at a Family 
Fitness Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Teens who work out but abuse their bodies in other ways, through diet and 
alcohol or drug abuse, lower the efficiency of their exercise. The cholesterol 
in fast food, a serious downfall in the diet of many teens, can clog arteries 
and diminish cardiovascular stamina. Alcohol depletes the body's vitamin 
resources and blocks the use of carbohydrates in muscle activities. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Back to the commercial with the two beautiful teen-agers with sleek, 
well-toned bodies. The next time you watch that commercial, put down your 
potato chips and remember that it's unlikely those teens just woke up one 
morning with perfect bodies. It is very likely, though, that they exercise 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 Becoming physically fit doesn't make troubles melt away, but the way you look 
at those troubles may change along with the shape of your body.

 Convicted officials -- The Capitol Journal column on Monday erred in stating 
that a statewide elected official is automatically removed from office when 
convicted by a jury of a felony. The removal does not come until sentencing or 
the trial judge denies motions to set aside the verdict. There is no such 
provision for removing a legislator, who may be expelled by the lawmaker's 
house.

Paper Chase" were incorrect. The picture under the headline "More Style Than 
Money" shows a green marbleized pen ($25), Noteworthy, Beverly Center. The

RUSSIANS LEAVE GERMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Russians Leave Germany Minus Fond Farewells," June 26: 
</P>
<P>
 The proper comparison, on the apples for apples principle, is to compare the 
339,000 troops plus the 211,000 dependents and civilian support personnel the 
former Soviet Union kept in the former East Germany with the several hundred 
thousand troops and dependents the U.S., Britain and France kept in West 
Germany, and the conclusion would have been that there indeed was a near parity 
of forces facing each other in the Cold War. To compare the Russian forces or 
former Soviet Union forces with the token force of 12,000 the U.S., Britain and 
France maintained in West Berlin alone is ridiculous.  
</P>
<P>
 Why should Germany allow Russian Gen. Matvei Burlakov and his troops to parade 
in West Berlin, which the Russians tried to destroy from 1948 until 1990? 
Remember the Berlin Airlift and the Berlin Wall! Why not let Burlakov parade in 
the dilapidated surroundings in East Germany, which he and his predecessors 
created in 45 years of oppressive, dictatorial rule? 
</P>
<P>
 Did the oppressed of 1956 in Hungary give the Russian aggressors a "fond 
farewell" when they finally left? They most certainly did not! Did the 1968 
Czech oppressed give their oppressors, the Russians, a "fond farewell"? No, 
they did not! Why would the Russian oppressors now expect a "fond farewell" 
from the 1953 oppressed? 
</P>

 * You are to be commended on your informative article. However, when you say 
that the 30,000 Germans who turned out to see the Russian farewell parade were 
"a much smaller crowd than turned out for the Allies," you have succumbed to 
the same kind of historical revisionism you expose. The Soviet Union was one of 
the (our!) Allies in World War II. That is not the only truth erased by the 
brainwashing of the Cold War.
