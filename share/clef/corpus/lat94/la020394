CITY HALL NEWS: TORRANCE; COUNCIL REJECTS BUS LOCATER SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Torrance will not spend $1.1 million to install a high-tech vehicle locater on 
city buses, the City Council decided Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 City Manager LeRoy J. Jackson said the city will improve safety for bus 
drivers by purchasing an "off-the-shelf" radio system instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle locater system uses satellites to automatically relay the position 
of the bus when the driver presses an alarm. The system would have been 
custom-built for the city, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding from the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a 
major contributor to the project, is uncertain, so city staff recommended 
rejecting the costly satellite system. The council vote was unanimous.  
</P>
<P>
 The city Transportation Department had recommended the system after six bus 
drivers were assaulted by passengers in six years. The city has been using 
security guards on some routes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said the city will look for a much simpler system, which he expects to 
bring back for council review in about 60 days. Funding for the system will 
come from a $300,000 federal Urban Mass Transportation Administration grant.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: BREWING UP A CULINARY FEAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the past several years, Southern California has seen the opening of several 
brew pubs -- bars that make their own beer. While it can be debated which one 
makes the best beer, there is little argument that the best food among the 
growing population of South Bay brew pubs can be found at the Redondo Beach 
Brewing Co. in the Hollywood Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
 What sets the Redondo Beach Brewing Co. apart is that one of the pub's owners, 
James Brown, just happens to be the brother of Christine Brown, the executive 
chef of the acclaimed Fino in Torrance. Christine recently revamped the menu at 
the pub, and now the RBBC is a worthy destination even if you don't like beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most brew pubs, it has a familiar selection of appetizers -- Buffalo 
chicken wings, curly French fries and onion rings. But the menu gets quite 
interesting in the pasta and pizza department. The most popular pasta is penne 
P.V. ($7.50), a plate of straight macaroni tubes with grilled chicken breast, 
mushrooms, tomatoes, green onions, Parmesan and tortilla chips in a chipotle 
pepper cream sauce. Farfalle ($7.50) comes with chicken sausage, zucchini, 
mushrooms, and garlic swathed in a roasted sweet red bell pepper sauce. Not 
exactly typical bar food. 
</P>
<P>
 The RBBC also offers a sophisticated version of that beloved culinary duo beer 
and pizza. To go with the 20 styles of ale, there are six pizza offerings, such 
as one made with chunks of barbecued chicken, mozzarella, smoked Gouda and 
sweet red onions ($7.50). The vegetarian pizza ($6.95) holds a mix of 
mozzarella and Fontina cheeses, red and yellow bell peppers, artichoke hearts, 
diced tomatoes, mushrooms, red onions, and fresh basil that is colorful enough 
to pass for Renoir's palette. 
</P>
<P>
 Beer drinkers will have fun sampling the various ales, which are available in 
five-ounce tasting glasses for $1. One of the more popular selections, Bohemian 
Pilsner, is patterned after Czechoslovakia's world famous Pilsner Urquell. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redondo Beach Brewing Co. is at 1814 S. Catalina Ave., Redondo Beach; 
316-8477. Open seven days 11:30 a.m. to 1 a.m.

STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Once again the President states that the tax increase was only on the top 1% 
of the wealthy and in his words "that is the truth." Apparently the President's 
advisers did not pass Arithmetic I; or they think that Social Security 
recipients are too old to know the difference; or someone is flat lying. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife and I are Social Security recipients whose taxes will go up 16% -- a 
much higher increase than on the wealthy. Why? Because the amount of Social 
Security income subject to tax has been increased. Somehow this part of the 
deficit reduction program gets little attention. As one of the millions of 
Americans who worked all his life and was counting on Social Security as part 
of my nest egg, much of President Clinton's "message" is clear -- the middle 
class, both young and old, will take it in the shorts again.

<P>
 * I believe we finally have a President that is intensely interested in our 
welfare. Every time he has suggested a way to change a poor system he has met 
strong opposition. The opposition is petty, spiteful and mean-spirited. 
</P>
<P>
 My husband is a very small business owner. He has four employees and pays 100% 
on insurance premiums for them and their families. Not only are the monthly 
premiums terribly expensive, but the stress of paying them is a monthly 
occurrence. We believe, however, that it is a responsibility that must be met. 
The biggest problem is the high deductible for each individual on the plan. In 
my opinion the insurance companies have it made. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time to realize that the only people who don't believe there is a health 
care crisis are the insurance companies; the doctors, who never stop telling us 
how bad it will be if the health care bill passes; and members of Congress, who 
have very good coverage for themselves and their families. They are also the 
ones who will vote on it. Don't we deserve at least what we are paying to cover 
our civil servants? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe President and Mrs. Clinton's plan needs work -- so quit fighting and 
work on it. Don't kill it or delay it. How come we are now hearing about all 
these other plans they have, and a chart to boot? Where were all these ideas 
when their Presidents were in office? 
</P>

 * Let me see if I understand this. In 1937 the Social Security tax was 2% of 
payroll with a maximum of $60 per year. In 1994 the rate is 15.30% and the 
maximum tax (for all practical purposes) is $9,271. Now the same government 
that did such a good job of managing and controlling Social Security costs is 
going to manage and control health insurance costs. Get serious, Mr. Clinton.

<P>
 * In his State of the Union address, President Clinton remarked that the 
people are way ahead of the politicians. That is certainly the case with Sen. 
Bob Dole (R-Kan.), whose weak rebuttal included the tired argument that 
American health care is the best in the world. What we really have is the 
world's most advanced medical technology, whose high-priced delivery is 
available only for those who can afford to pay for it. As for the medical care 
available for most Americans, we are dismally behind much of the world. Dole 
certainly knows this, but in trumpeting his contrived deception he reveals 
himself to be a cheap politician.

 * Why is it that three years ago when former Vice President Dan Quayle spoke 
about this country needing strong family values and that the importance of 
two-parent families should not be mocked, he was mercilessly ridiculed and 
shunned; but when President Clinton states fundamentally the same thing in 
1994, he is praised and respected? 
</P>
<P>
 Is it the obvious media double standard, or was Dan Quayle way ahead of his 
time, or has the Democratic Party finally realized that many problematic issues 
in this country can be solved with old-fashioned common sense and a logical 
approach?

TRANSPORTATION AND QUAKES

<TEXT>
<P>
 * Among the many sobering realities brought clearly into focus by the recent 
tragic earthquake is Southern California's extreme vulnerability to its 
transportation system. As the extent of damage inflicted becomes apparent, we 
must question critically the confidence we have placed in the automobile as our 
transport medium of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no single solution for Los Angeles. Expanding local bus service will 
help, but we have seen that when our highway systems are damaged, this option 
is also hindered. One bright spot that has emerged in this otherwise disastrous 
situation is our new rail transit network. Metro Link was in service just hours 
after the earthquake hit, transitioning smoothly from near-empty to 
overcapacity in a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Metro Red Line subway system Downtown and the Metro Blue Line light-rail 
system from Long Beach were undamaged and back in operation the next morning. 
In fact, if not for the 5.5 magnitude aftershock which prompted additional 
inspections, these rail systems could have been in service the same day, 
paralleling the critically important performance of San Francisco's BART system 
following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 The need to move people efficiently from one section of Los Angeles to another 
is of paramount importance if we are to rebuild and revitalize our local 
economy. As we continue the process of setting future priorities for Southern 
California, we need to escalate efforts to move more aggressively toward the 
implementation of a true multi-modal mass transportation system, incorporating 
our existing network of freeways with light and heavy rail transit and bus 
systems linked to our airports, seaports and centers of commerce.

 * Commuting by bicycle is among the ways to ease traffic congestion. Although 
many bicyclists have commuted long before the Northridge earthquake, many new 
and less experienced riders have taken to the road to avoid gridlock and "do 
their part." We do our best to move with the flow of traffic and avoid 
potential hazards, such as opening car doors, narrowed lanes, and careless 
drivers making left and right turns across our paths. In turn, we ask for a bit 
of attention paid to our presence, and perhaps some acknowledgment that we are 
decreasing the actual number of cars on the road.

EPA POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Bravo to The Times for its editorial supporting California in its ongoing 
battle against the heavy-handed tactics of EPA bureaucrats ("Whatever Happened 
to Give and Take?" Jan. 24). What is a bit surprising, however, is that The 
Times failed to mention the very different positions taken on this issue by 
California legislators.There were 17 House Democrats and one Senate Democrat 
who, when confronted with the choice of supporting California or Washington, 
came down squarely on the side of the feds. In fact, Sen. Barbara Boxer, Rep. 
Henry Waxman, and 16 of their liberal California colleagues wrote to Gov. Pete 
Wilson demanding that he buckle under to EPA demands, even though that would 
mean denying California $1 billion in highway funding that is due the state and 
result in 21,000 lost jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since this issue surfaced back in May I have authored several letters -- 
co-signed by 17 of my House Republican colleagues -- to Administration 
officials asking that they work with the state to develop an acceptable 
alternative plan that would avoid the adverse impact of the EPA's diktat -- a 
position The Times appears now to endorse (better late than never). 
</P>
<P>
 I have also introduced legislation, H.R. 3146, to specifically address this 
problem. My bill would allow California's inspection and maintenance program to 
meet the federal Clean Air Act requirements without interference from beltway 
bureaucrats. To date, not one California Democrat has co-sponsored my bill.

<P>
 In response to "Sigoloff Drops Bid for Top Schools Job," Jan. 28: 
</P>
<P>
 I was sorry for the children of California to learn that Sanford Sigoloff's 
name was withdrawn for state superintendent of public instruction. Again the 
special interest groups win and the people lose.What a shame that the 
legislators heard the fear of change from the teachers' union, which is such an 
important source of campaign funds for the politicians who follow the money 
instead of leading the public school system out of its low stature. 
</P>
<P>
 Sigoloff should have been given a chance to try something creative. Instead we 
will end up with someone who is controlled by the teachers' union and assures 
us of nothing more than the status quo, which has proven to be defective and 
very ill.

A YELLOW LIGHT ON ALAMEDA CORRIDOR DEAL; RAIL LINK: IT'S A LAUDABLE PROJECT BUT 
DON'T OVERPAY AND GET THE FINANCING IN PLACE FIRST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY B. EPSTEIN, Jerry B. Epstein is a member of the California 
Transportation Commission. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congratulations to Mayor Richard Riordan and our elected officials for their 
determination to purchase the Alameda Corridor right-of-way from the Southern 
Pacific Railroad. The improvement of this vital rail link from the ports of Los 
Angeles and Long Beach to the rest of the nation will be an important catalyst 
to our economic revival. 
</P>
<P>
 But before the cities of Los Angeles and Long Beach sign on the dotted line, 
especially in the post-earthquake environment, our officials ought to look 
skeptically at the deal. In their admirable zeal to jump-start the project, 
these officials may have let their enthusiasm get the best of their business 
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, would you pay the down payment on a house without knowing if you 
could get a loan? That, unfortunately, is what the cities have done with their 
well-intentioned efforts to secure the Alameda Corridor without ensuring its 
financing first. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the cities are simply paying too much for the right-of-way. The highest 
objective appraisal for the property was less than one-half the $240-million 
purchase price announced. By agreeing to this extravagant price, the cities are 
implicitly endorsing Southern Pacific's argument that it deserves to be 
compensated for its perceived "loss of competitive advantage," a dubious 
proposition that could have serious consequences for other right-of-way 
purchases for the public good. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, by negotiating on their own, the cities neglected the advice of 
Public Utilities Commission President Daniel Fessler to utilize the enormous 
clout of the state's eminent-domain powers. Recent legislation, designed with 
the Alameda Corridor in mind, gave the state Department of Transportation the 
right to condemn railroad property. In fact, the secretary of the state 
Business, Transportation and Housing Agency has also been directed to develop 
procedures for the fair valuation of railroad property by March, 1994. Given 
the high price tag, and the questionable legal arguments of the railroad, many 
Sacramento observers believe the cities should have sought the state's 
assistance and taken their chances in court. 
</P>
<P>
 What is often forgotten is that every dollar spent on right-of-way is one 
dollar less that is available for financing the track improvements necessary to 
upgrade the level of service on the Alameda Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the cities are purchasing the right-of-way without a financing plan in 
place for the project. However worthy it is, and it is clearly one of the most 
important infrastructure projects in our state, there is still no guarantee of 
federal or state backing for it. The cities could lose millions of dollars in 
interest income they could generate from the $240 million while they battle for 
federal and state money. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the recession, shortfalls in federal allocations and voter 
rejection of the last transportation bond issue, for example, it is unlikely 
that additional state funds would be available for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 And, now, because of the pressing need for federal disaster relief and the 
state's efforts to encourage federal assumption of the costs associated with 
illegal immigration, it will be all the more difficult to win the $700 million 
in federal funds the ports asked for just before the earthquake. If our 
congressional delegation fails to secure this funding, then the ports will be 
left without more than one-third of the money required to complete the desired 
improvements.  
</P>
<P>
 Texas recently axed a "bullet train" project because the financing plan fell 
apart. Los Angeles should take a lesson from this and not make the same 
mistake.  
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the proposed financing plan is also dependent upon raising port user 
fees to pay for $600 million in new revenue bonds. Southern Pacific is the only 
railroad that has agreed to the new fees, even though all the railroads and 
shippers will benefit greatly from the tripling of shipments and a fourfold 
increase in speeds as a result of the corridor improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it makes little sense for the public to have to bear any of the cost 
associated with the environmental clean-up of the railroad right-of-way. The 
cities may face an unpleasant surprise one day of millions of dollars in 
additional liability for toxic-waste removal and disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 No one with any concern for California's economic future wants to jeopardize 
the Alameda Corridor project, and the proactive efforts of the cities of Los 
Angeles and Long Beach to move this critical project forward should be 
applauded. It is particularly noteworthy that Mayor Riordan has consulted with 
our congressional delegation to enlist their vital support. 
</P>
<P>
 During these hard times, and with the likely prospect of even leaner federal, 
state and local budgets in the near future, our elected officials should 
question whether this is the best deal for the public -- or the best deal for 
one railroad, a company that has already received nearly $1 billion for other 
railroad property from state and local agencies since 1990.

COLUMN LEFT/ ALEXANDER COCKBURN: SPECULATION VS. DEMOCRACY IN TOPANGA; THE 
DISNEY FAMILY WANTS TO BLITZ THE HILLTOPS FOR A GOLF COURSE AND MANSION PADS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER COCKBURN, Alexander Cockburn, a visitor to Topanga Canyon with 
friends in the area, writes for the Nation and other publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Feb. 10, the five supervisors of Los Angeles County will vote on a 
real-estate scheme scheduled for the summit of Topanga Canyon: 257 acres to 
contain up to 97 sites, selling for up to $750,000 apiece, with all future 
mansions, assuming any get built, appropriately gated and guarded.  
</P>
<P>
 The whole development -- another word they've stolen from us -- will be 
anchored to a golf course and club house offering membership at $55,000 a pop.  
</P>
<P>
 Topanga Canyon links a state park to the mountains to the west. Particularly 
around the proposed site, "Canyon Oaks Estates," the landscape is still wild. 
Topanga Canyon creek flows naturally to the sea. The unpretentious community in 
the canyon, largely moderate in income, prudent in evolution, considerate of 
its environmental circumstance, has always heeded the values that generations 
of planners have said Los Angeles should pursue. 
</P>
<P>
 The area plan for Malibu and the Santa Monica Mountains, approved by 
supervisors more than a decade ago after careful review by citizens and 
relevant agencies, laid down sensible guidelines to protect natural habitat and 
recreational lands -- lungs for a crowded and suffocating city.  
</P>
<P>
 The Canyon Oaks scheme flouts all 10 goals of the area plan. It is a flatland 
project foisted on mountain terrain. It will require the drastic transformation 
of landscape. Up to 80% of this mountainous land would be recontoured and 
shoved flat by bulldozers.  
</P>
<P>
 Irretrievable alteration of landscape would be mere prelude to a shunting of 
Topanga Canyon from a modest corner of the greater L.A. Monopoly board to a 
corridor of water-intensive, environmentally devastating, community-ripping 
high-end speculations carving through from the San Fernando Valley to the sea.  
</P>
<P>
 The proposed golf course alone will require several times the daily water use 
of the community, up to 1.6 million gallons daily pumped up to the canyon's 
highest point to irrigate the toxic sump that any golf course inevitably 
becomes.  
</P>
<P>
 These are among the costs that economists call "externalities," meaning that 
the community at large will bear the environmental price.  
</P>
<P>
 And if the speculation fails, if the golf club -- fulcrum of the project -- 
attracts insufficient members, if the price of the sites is too high, there'll 
be no going back. The bulldozers will have gouged out the hills, bladed out the 
oaks, destroyed the ecosystem. The "developers" will have moved on. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Oaks has already led a prolonged and checkered existence. It was 
floated in 1977 as the Montevideo Country Club. Fourteen years later, after 35 
times at bat before county officials, the project went into Chapter 11, during 
which time the county supervisors voted it down 3-1 (Mike Antonovich not 
present). Antonovich later allowed it to creep back into the review process. 
</P>
<P>
 With the original promoter out of the picture, the prime partner in the 
enterprise until her death was Sharon Disney Lund, daughter of Walt. Disney 
family interests, including Lund's heirs, now control the scheme.  
</P>
<P>
 They wield great clout, not least that useful solvent of impasse and 
obstruction, money. Supervisors Antonovich and Deane Dana have accepted ample 
contributions running into many thousands from the Disneys and their 
representatives. Supervisors Ed Edelman and Gloria Molina have declined. The 
crucial vote is held by Supervisor Yvonne Burke, who has seen her own campaign 
coffers pleasingly augmented by very substantial contributions, including 
$20,000 from Canyon Oaks Estates and Lund early last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course this does not mean that Burke has committed herself to Canyon Oaks. 
Her moving New Year pledges about the future of Los Angeles would suggest 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 The scheme rejected in 1991 by Edelman, because it was utterly contrary to the 
area plan, is substantially unchanged. Molina's stance, that a gated enclave 
hacked from hillsides flouts the desires of a vibrant local community, is as 
valid as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 This is speculation versus democracy. The area's political representatives -- 
state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman 
(D-Brentwood), Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) -- are all opposed. 
So are the city councils of Calabasas and Malibu; the Hillside and Canyon 
Federation, representing 300,000 homeowners; the Topanga-Los Virgines 
Conservation District, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, both national 
and state park services, plus the Restoration Project for Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Drive up Topanga Canyon now and one sees hillsides seared by the November 
fires. They will recover. The community has come through fire and quake. Drive 
on up to the summit. If those bulldozers roll, there will be no recovery.

COLUMN RIGHT / TOM BETHELL: OF PRESIDENTS, STATE TROOPERS AND CHARACTER; IN THE 
STATE OF THE UNION, CLINTON SAID WE SHOULD TEACH VALUES 'BY OUR EXAMPLE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM BETHELL, Tom Bethell is Washington correspondent of the American 
Spectator. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following the allegations of sexual misconduct by Bill Clinton when he was 
governor of Arkansas, the conventional wisdom has been that, while readers may 
be interested in prurient fashion, they don't really think that such "private" 
behavior affects the President's handling of his job. The Whitewater business 
is another matter, we are told. That involves a failed savings and loan and 
possible influence peddling. Readers are interested in that. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me that this is quite wrong. There is no doubt that the great 
majority of readers do regard the extramarital behavior of the President-to-be 
as newsworthy. The real question is whether they ought to, whether it is a 
legitimate topic of inquiry. To be sure, there is bound to be "prurient 
interest" in such stories, but that does not necessarily exclude legitimate 
interest. "Worthy" news does not have to be dull news. 
</P>
<P>
 Some journalists may have, rather, played up Whitewater if only to show 
they're not soft on presidential peccadilloes. "Because journalists can't go 
after Clinton on the sex," Newsweek's Evan Thomas was quoted as saying the 
other day, "they're going after him on the finances." Finances, usually, make 
for boring reading. But OK, let's be good citizens, put on our green eyeshades 
and "follow the money." Perhaps the investigation will shed new light on the 
strange death of Vincent Foster. Whether by the standards of the stuffiest 
insider or the customer at the supermarket check-out counter, that might be big 
news. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, what about the sexual allegations? Have we really become so cynical 
in America that we are now indifferent to the observance of marriage vows? It 
was only a generation ago that Nelson Rockefeller was thought to be ineligible 
for the presidency because he was divorced. Polling suggests that values may 
not have changed quite as much as we imagine. About 90% of respondents have 
consistently said that sexual relations outside marriage are "always" or 
"almost always" wrong. In 1991, 35% of those surveyed in a Wall Street 
Journal-NBC poll thought that an extramarital affair should disqualify a 
candidate from becoming President. (The same percentage thought not, and the 
rest weren't sure). 
</P>
<P>
 Political biases strongly affect these responses, as might be expected. When 
Gallup recently asked whether the Arkansas troopers' charges "are important 
indicators of Clinton's character and ability to serve as President, and should 
be thoroughly examined by the news media," 54% of Republicans, but only 20% of 
Democrats, said yes. It is indeed difficult to dispense with political 
preference in answering such questions. Twenty years ago, the "character issue" 
was raised time and again by Democrats against President Nixon. Republicans 
were inclined to say that Nixon was still functioning adequately as President. 
In the end, however, that pretense could not be sustained. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps presidential "character" was more important during the Cold War, when 
there was legitimate concern about the finger on the nuclear button. But we 
have our own important issues today, among them the rising tide of illegitimacy 
as a major national concern. In the State of the Union address, the President 
admonished us "by our example" to teach children to "cherish our values." With 
such an agenda, allegations about his own conduct cannot simply be dismissed as 
irrelevant. His performance as President, recall, involves a good measure of 
persuasion -- and it is bound to be affected by perceptions of his own 
sincerity or hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington writer Sally Quinn said recently that "the stream of 
allegations out of Little Rock" has "taken its toll." When the President asks 
us to trust him on Bosnia or the defense budget, she added, "some of us feel 
uneasy. Words like 'character' and 'trust' become codes for the President's 
private behavior." In carefully impersonal language, she noted "a reluctance to 
actually confront the question of a president's past personal transgressions 
for fear that will make them true. . . . As long as we don't give the question 
official credence, don't take it more seriously than laughing at the nightly 
jokes, the soul of the presidency will not be tarnished." 
</P>
<P>
 A final note: There has been much talk in Washington about how "cynical" the 
public has become -- excessively distrustful of politicians, for example. But 
it may be that the cynicism is most pervasive inside the Beltway. When the 
"Troopergate" story broke, one journalist here publicly disparaged it as "two 
troopers who are trying to get a book deal." Is this not the soul of cynicism? 
The cash nexus explains all. We should not dismiss too lightly the possibility 
that a measure of legitimate moral disapproval was involved.

NEW AND USEFUL / LYNN SIMROSS: CARDS: YOUR VOICE HERE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For Valentine's Day, how about cards that talk -- in your own voice -- flowery 
picture frames or some handy gadgets that could make life a little brighter for 
a loved one? 
</P>
<P>
 Although talking greeting cards have been available for several years, the 
latest technology has brought them to another level. Now you can send your own 
greeting on Hallmark Recordable Greeting Cards. A voice chip allows the sender 
to record a 10-second message. If you mess up, you can re-record. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentine Recordable Greeting Cards ($7.95) come in six designs and are 
available nationally in card and gift stores. The only drawback? Because the 
computer chip adds weight, it will cost $1.45 to mail this valentine. 
</P>
<P>

 Frame It: The latest old-fashioned photo frames from Los Angeles designer 
Deborah Rhein would please a mom, aunt or grandmother. Rhein decorates pine 
frames with dried flowers. Among her new designs are one with a dozen single 
roses and one featuring traditional English garden flowers. They are available 
in sizes of 3 1/2 by 5 inches, 5 by 7 inches and 8 by 10 inches. Each is hand 
done and signed. 
</P>
<P>
 The frames, ranging in price from $28 to $90, are available at Nordstrom, Fred 
Segal and Saks Fifth Avenue stores; at A Room With a View and Z Gallerie in 
Santa Monica, and Jumping Dog in Century City. Or you can order them from 
Rhein, 318 W. 9th St., Suite 1009, Los Angeles, Calif. 90015; (213) 624-ROSE.

 Mug Magic: Drink holders in cars were designed for soda cans, not coffee mugs. 
So a practical gift for commuters or travelers is the Tower Travel Mug, one of 
few that fits almost every cup holder for the road -- or in the boat or the 
golf cart. Minneapolis marketing executive Tom Schaeppi designed the 
six-inch-tall mug "because of my own needs. I was using one of those 
wide-bottomed mugs and setting it over the drink holders in my van. That didn't 
make a lot of sense, so I started looking for one that would fit, and it wasn't 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Tower Travel Mug holds 12 ounces and has a spill-resistant lid. It comes in 
black recycled plastic (suggested retail, $3.99 to $5.99) or black, white, 
teal, rose or gray ceramic ($10.99 to $14.99). The mugs are available 
nationwide at Target stores, coffee and gourmet specialty shops, and selected 
auto dealerships, or by writing to TM Marketing, 510 1st Ave. N., Suite 403, 
P.O. Box 3200, Minneapolis, Minn. 55403; (800) 359-0794. By mail, the plastic 
mug is $5, plus $2 shipping; ceramic, $14, plus $2.50 shipping.

 Clutter's Gone: Perfumes are de rigueur for Valentine's Day, but don't rule 
out practical personal care items. An organizer called the Basket Case can help 
end cosmetic clutter. It's a lattice-work basket with a high-tech look made of 
recyclable plastic. The Basket Case comes in a small round (6 inches high, 12 
inches in diameter) or medium oval (6 by 11 by 16 inches) in cobalt blue, jade 
and ruby. Each has room for cosmetics, a hair dryer and large shampoo bottles, 
and there's a pullup tray with sections for soap, toothbrush and toothpaste, 
dental floss or manicure supplies, cotton swabs and razor. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufactured by Cosmepak in Morristown, N.J., the Basket Case ($11.99 round; 
$14.99 oval) is available nationwide at Wal-Mart, K mart, Target, J.C. Penney 
and Drug Emporium. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Tooling Around: Pocket Workshop is a nifty little tool with a variety of uses. 
It combines 11 tools in one and has a vinyl pouch for easy carrying in a pocket 
or on a belt. In a sturdy 5 1/2-ounce unit, Pocket Workshop contains pliers 
(regular and needle-nose), a file, a Phillips screwdriver, three sizes of slot 
screwdrivers, large and small knife blades, a wire cutter, and a can and bottle 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
 At $19.75, it is far more reasonably priced than other versions. To order, 
write to St. James, P.O. Box 558, Ventura, Calif. 93002. Shipping and handling 
are included in the price. 
</P>

<P>
 Control of the Remote: "Where's the remote?" is a frequent question in 
American households. A useful present to help organize your electronics at home 
or at the office is the Remote Center, a smoked bronze-colored acrylic case 
with four compartments to hold remote control units of all sizes. Measuring 10 
by 5 1/2 by 3 inches, the Remote Center has a lid with a hinged cover to 
protect the devices from dirt, spills and damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Remote Center ($19.95, plus $3 shipping and handling) is available from 
Milah Products, 6345 Denny Ave., Suite 4, North Hollywood, Calif. 91606; (818) 
503-3353.

 What's up? A to Z -- a potpourri. Colleagues could have Snoopy dancing for joy 
at their Neiman Marcus Valentino Spring Collection fashion show luncheon Feb. 
14 at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. With Charles Schulz collared as honoree, 
Betsy Bloomingdale and Anne Johnson are concocting fun and surprises. On hand 
will be new Colleagues members -- Marcia Hobbs, Travis Kranz, Joan Mackey, 
Kathleen McCarthy and Lisa Hornburg McGee. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Valentine's Day, the governors, trustees and Alliance Board of the 
Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County celebrate their official 
announcement, postponed because of the earthquake, of the coming "Genghis Khan 
Treasures from Inner Mongolia," a collaboration of priceless artifacts never 
exhibited outside China. The collection premieres March 5 at the annual 
black-tie Dinosaur Ball at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 More pizazz: Ray Charles highlights the American Heart Assn. Heart Ball Feb. 
25 at the Beverly Wilshire. Henry Mancini and Dudley Moore host the Composers & 
Arrangers Foundation scholarship fund-raiser Feb. 8 at the Wilshire Theatre. 
U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary keynotes the Black Business 
Assn.'s 20th annual Excellence in Business Awards Dinner on Feb. 17 at the 
Westin Bonaventure. 
</P>
<P>
 Superhosting: Most of the cracks in Jane and Marc Nathanson's Lloyd 
Wright-designed home in Holmby Hills were gone soon after the earthquake. 
Expecting about 160 for their Museum of Contemporary Art Directors Forum dinner 
honoring artist Roy Lichtenstein on Jan. 28, they quickly hired painters and 
plasterers to caulk up in a matter of several days. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, guests had absolutely no distractions while viewing the Nathansons' 
contemporary art collection and chatting with the honoree, who's been the 
center of attraction in Los Angeles because of his major retrospective on view 
at MOCA through April 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispensing hugs and kisses with the Nathansons in the foyer -- where 
Lichtenstein's "Interior With Three Lamps" hangs -- were the museum's director, 
Richard Koshalek, and his wife, Betty.  
</P>
<P>
 There were few regrets. The invitations sent to MOCA's most exclusive 
individual donor group were compelling -- Lucite renditions of Lichtenstein's 
famous, "Oh, Jeff . . . I Love You, Too . . . But," the 1964 oil from the 
Stefan T. Edlis Collection. Collector Joan Nicholas said she and Fred had 
theirs standing on a table. 
</P>
<P>
 Milling through the Nathanson home during cocktails were collectors Julian and 
Joann Ganz, Mary Lou and George Boone, Bob Tuttle with Maria Hummer, Lenore and 
Bernard Greenberg, and Audrey and Sydney Irmas. MOCA Chairman and Times Mirror 
Editor-at-Large David Laventhol and his wife, Esther, and MOCA President John 
Cushman and his wife, Jeanie, were prominent in the front hallway, along with 
show curator Diane Waldman and dealers Doug Christmas, Irving Blum, Leo 
Castelli and antiques dealer Rose Tarlow. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallis Annenberg arrived with John Gerace. Eventually, guests meandered 
through the Nathansons' kitchen to a white tent where they dined on chicken 
curry placed in pineapple rings. 
</P>
<P>
 Clustered to collect cars from valets: "Cheers" producer-director Jim Burrows, 
Eli and Edythe Broad, Aviva and Carl Covitz, Beatrice and Philip Gersh, artist 
Ellsworth Kelly, Melba and Stanley Sanders, Sheila and Wally Weisman, Andrea 
Van de Kamp, and Bob and Laura-Lee Woods. 
</P>
<P>
 On Buchwald: That same evening, Dove Audio owners Deborah Raffin and Michael 
Viner honored humorist Art Buchwald to celebrate the audio-book release of his 
autobiography, "Leaving Home: A Memoir," at the Bistro Garden. Dropping by for 
a book and a laugh: Angie Dickinson, Roddy McDowall, Warren Cowan, Maria 
Shriver, Nina Foch, Gene and Patricia Kelly, and Henry and Roz Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
 Circuit: The next evening, Eli and Edythe Broad hosted an eclectic 600 to see 
the installation of the Broad Family Foundation collection in Santa Monica.  
</P>
<P>
 Curator Shelley DeAngelus greeted Joel Wachs; Stefan Edlis; Roger Harman; John 
and Kathinka Tunney; Stephanie Barron, Robert Gore Rifkind and their son, Max 
(Eli Broad's godson); Kirstin and Jesse Ganz with their grandparents, Julian 
and Joann Ganz (headed to Michael's later for dinner); Burt Pines. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some detoured down Venice Boulevard to the Santa Monica Freeway, 
headed for the Scripter Awards at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 USC supporters -- including Dr. Edward Zapanto, Lorna Reed, Virginia Ramo and 
Adrienne Pingree -- and USC Librarian Peter Lyman and Jim Childs (head of the 
Friends of the Libraries) were among several hundred who clustered in 
candlelight in the Doheny Library with its vaulted ceilings and book-lined 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Australian author Thomas Keneally (he's founder of the Australian 
Republican Movement) and screenwriter/adapter Steven Zaillian took honors for 
"Schindler's List" over 47 other books and corresponding films considered by 
the Scripter selection committee, headed by Marjorie Lord Volk.  
</P>
<P>
 She was in the audience with husband Harry and her look-alike daughter, 
actress Anne Archer. Poldek Page introduced the author. He is the survivor of a 
World War II labor camp who inspired Keneally to write the book after the 
author bought a briefcase in his Los Angeles leather shop. Steven Spielberg (of 
whom emcee Hal Kanter said, "Nobody speaks movie more articulately") arrived to 
introduce Zaillian, who sat next to his wife, Elizabeth.  
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, he's modest," Elizabeth Zaillian said. "He's also a wonderful father." 
</P>
<P>
 Can They?: The question at the Club 100 of the Music Center luncheon and panel 
discussion was "Can the Arts Help to Heal Los Angeles?" 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton Stanfill, new president of the Music Center, commented that the arts 
alone cannot heal the city, but they have "a language" all their own and are 
"central to our lives as a way of knowing ourselves." Others on the panel, held 
in conjuction with Town Hall of California, were Stephanie Barron, Eunice 
David, Councilman Joel Wachs, Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite-Burke, Roelle Hsieh 
Louie and moderator Stanley Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Novel: The Auxiliary of the Kenneth Norris Jr. Comprehensive Cancer Hospital 
(USC) is suggesting a "stay-at-home evening party for you and your Valentine." 
The location -- home, sweet home. Just send a donation.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; HOLD ONTO YOUR HAT FOR THIS WILD RIDE; DRAWING DEAD BY 
PETE HAUTMAN ; SIMON & SCHUSTER, $21, 285 PAGES

 Imagine the classic film "It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World," but with tightly 
drawn, psychologically provocative characters. Or "The Sting," with even more 
plot twists. Imagine "The Hustler" centered around comic books instead of pool 
tables, "A Big Hand for the Little Lady," when the "little lady" in question is 
a tough-talking, tender-hearted, leather-clad female biker, "Topkapi" set in 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 It's little wonder that "Drawing Dead," a romp of a first novel by Pete 
Hautman -- who writes nonfiction for children under the pen name of Peter 
Murray -- evokes comparison with highly entertaining movies. The book is 
fast-paced and highly visual, leaving this reader as breathless as if he had 
just stepped off a particularly steep roller-coaster ride. 
</P>
<P>
 As the multilayered schemes and scams begin to unfold, the only choice is to 
hang on for the duration and hope for the best. 
</P>
<P>
 The intricate story is impossible to summarize without revealing too much, but 
the cast of players alone is worth the price of admission. Joe Crow is an 
ex-cop, reformed coke head and card shark who wistfully pines for a lake cabin 
in northern Minnesota -- if he ever gets his life in gear and gets out of debt. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to get that cabin might happen if Rich "Dickie" Wicky, "a blond Buddy 
Hackett," wealthy and dumb enough to be everybody's No. 1 mark, pays off his 
gambling debt to Crow. 
</P>
<P>
 The odds against that are weighted by the presence of Catfish, Wicky's wife, a 
woman whose sexual appetite makes ordinary promiscuity seem like virtue. Even 
the streetwise Crow is mesmerized when he meets her for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something about her features -- their relative size or shape, maybe -- was 
alarming, as though at any moment he might discover that she had two 
different-color eyes (though both now looked solid black), or that her nose had 
the wrong number of nostrils (but he counted two), or that her teeth had been 
sharpened. And perhaps they had. He had the strong sense that her parents ought 
not to have met." 
</P>
<P>
 Off in the wings, but aimed like an incoming missile, is Joe Cadillac, a 
small-time Chicago hood with a short fuse and a long arm: Freddy Wisnesky, 
"dumb as a stump. Tell him he's got a fly on his nose and he'll knock himself 
out trying to slap it." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's a klutzy pair of comic-book counterfeiters (one of whom 
claims to have invented the lava lamp and been Question Mark in the old band 
Question Mark and the Mysterians); a gangster's moll who "had a file of brief, 
circular conversations in her head, with a special variation for everyone she 
knew"; a determined rural realtor named Jimbo, and Crow's conniving, 
hard-drinking father, all of whom decidedly complicate the picture even 
further. 
</P>
<P>
 Most interesting of all is Laura Debrowski, the above-mentioned biker. Smart, 
outwardly cool, brave and independent, she's more than a match for any 
adversary and never shies from a fight. Here's the conclusion of her first 
encounter with the predatory Joe Cadillac: 
</P>
<P>
 "His face hit the rug, then something came down on the back of his neck, 
pushing his face into the thick pure-wool pile of the hand-woven Persian rug, 
three thousand bucks, right off the truck. From the corner of his eye, he could 
see the sole of her boot." 
</P>
<P>
 "Drawing Dead" is a difficult book to pigeonhole -- mainly because it's so 
good. A caper novel loaded with action, humor and close calls, it consistently 
surprises by transcending the genre in the manner of Elmore Leonard's best 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Hautman manages, with clipped, original observations, to create 
believable men and women, people defined by both quirks and shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the backdrop of what, in a lesser writer's hands, might be formula 
fiction, he establishes a sense of place, class and time with indelible 
accuracy. An impressive debut.

INK / PAUL D. COLFORD: A LIFE ONCE DISTILLED IN VODKA AND TONIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Warm and snug in the Lion's Head as an icy rain lashes the Greenwich Village 
streets outside, Pete Hamill is recalling when this bar built its following in 
the late '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Seamen, stockbrokers, communists, bohemians, entertainers and newspapermen all 
found the subterranean haunt on Christopher Street -- such an eclectic crew, he 
says, "that I think that's what kept the sense of excitement going." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamill -- longtime Lion's Head customer, novelist, veteran columnist and the 
editor of the New York Post during several tumultuous weeks last year -- paints 
this nostalgic picture fueled not by strong waters, of which he consumed an 
ocean through the years, but by a diet soda. Later, he switches to black 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the enduring image of hard-swilling news animal that adheres so 
readily to a few columnists, Hamill ended his drinking days and nights 22 years 
ago. He was seeing in the new year with a vodka and tonic in one hand, Shirley 
MacLaine's hand in the other and the lounge crooner Buddy Greco performing 
before a room rich with gangsters and beehive hairdos. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeling as if he was in a badly written play, he stared into his glass and 
said to himself, "I'm never going to do this again." Cold turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That scene ends Hamill's memoir, "A Drinking Life" (Little, Brown). He 
describes the moment when he decided "I will live my life from now on, I will 
not perform it," only after he retraces his lifelong intimacy with booze and 
the resulting wreckage.  
</P>
<P>
 As a result, his story becomes a memoir of Brooklyn during the '40s and '50s, 
the thirsty Irish who peopled its street corner taverns and the complicated 
yearnings among first-generation Americans such as himself who were bound by 
the suffocating code of The Neighborhood. It tells of Hemingway-esque 
wanderlust in Spain and Mexico and the uneasy love between a father and his 
oldest son. And always, the glass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of being a man was to drink," he writes. In Hamill's case, more than two 
decades of the drinking life -- working hard, but carousing with pals when he 
wasn't working -- cost him a marriage and left him with a lingering regret over 
unrealized opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing I wanted to do was write some kind of John Barleycorn, Jack 
London kind of screed about the evils of drink." Hamill says. "And I know that 
you can't separate the dancer from the dance. You can't deal with the problem, 
particularly if it's crucial to your life, without explaining the life and the 
way those two things were woven together." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamill, 58, originally began writing a book about the year 1955 in New York, 
seeking to answer the question: The city has gone to hell compared to when? 
"And I realized that there was a common bond to a lot of the research -- and 
that was drinking," he says. "It was everywhere in the culture then. If you 
went to the Cedar Tavern, there were Jackson Pollock and Franz Kline. It was 
all over, among the poets, among the writers. The '50s was still a very 
hard-drinking period in New York." 
</P>
<P>
 He decided to set aside thick files of research material to mine his own 
history and how he ended up drying out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To those who have passed nights secure in what Hamill calls "the leveling 
democracy of drink," his book may evoke a warm, perhaps dimly remembered 
feeling of those welcoming taverns where all are one and the past barely 
exists. A good bar is "the womb," Hamill says. "I don't think it's 
sentimentalizing or romanticizing it to acknowledge the power of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I call 'the drinking life' or 'the culture of drink' includes not just 
the stuff that's in the glass but everything that goes with it. A great bar 
when it's working has an element of forgiveness in it. If you're a total idiot, 
your friends forgive you." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Hamill concedes that, yes, he hopes that the honesty of his 
story will also prove helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 "If two people read it and say, 'I got to stop this bleep . I gotta live my 
life and not perform it,' then it's accomplished something," he says. "But I 
know from my own time as a drinker and from the lives of my friends and 
relatives who have had hard times with this thing, that the last thing you can 
do with a person is a sermon. You can't go in and say, 'Repent ye wicked, the 
day of judgment is nigh.' And most of the literature that I looked at is 
basically sermonizing." 
</P>
<P>
 Since draining that last vodka and tonic in 1972, Hamill has written pulp 
fiction, serious novels, short-story collections and books of reportage. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Drinking Life," his 11th book, may turn out to be his biggest hit. Although 
it reached stores only recently, sales in New York and Los Angeles have begun 
strong, and, based on mostly good reviews, Little, Brown and Co. has ordered 
what it calls a "sizable" second printing.

 On the Racks: Six years after the death of Louis L'Amour, Dell Magazines has 
launched Louis L'Amour Western Magazine with a 300,000-copy print run, 
including 75,000 subscriptions. The new bimonthly will concentrate on new 
western fiction, in the tradition of the so-called "pulps," the grainy 
publications that gave L'Amour an outlet for his stories starting in the 1940s. 
The premiere also features a travel piece about the Southwest by novelist Tony 
Hillerman.

MUSIC REVIEW; A TRIO'S SUM OUTSHINES ITS PARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anyone with brains is going to want to keep the Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson 
Trio from leaving town. Sigh. It's probably too late. 
</P>
<P>
 At least the trio left memories of a virtually ideal concert, co-sponsored by 
the Orange County Philharmonic Society and the Laguna Chamber Music Society at 
the Irvine Barclay Theatre Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Pianist Joseph Kalichstein, violinist Jaime Laredo and cellist Sharon Robinson 
played works by Haydn, Mendelssohn and Schubert with warmth and incandescent 
intelligence. Each musician made an individual contribution, but the sum was 
greater than the parts. The three matched, supported and spurred each other on, 
whether in matters of tone-color or phrasing or structure or dynamic. 
</P>
<P>
 The uncanny result was that the music (even though sometimes marred by 
Laredo's faulty intonation) sounded as if it were emerging for the first time, 
rather than resulting from rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio brought airy and easy grace, caressing phrases and popping good humor 
to Haydn's Trio in A, Hob. XV:18, a work that lavishes more responsibilities on 
the pianist than on the string players, and more on the violinist than on the 
poor cellist who has continuo duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson was rewarded for her attentive if inconspicuous labor in the Haydn by 
getting to initiate the noble first and the ardent second theme of 
Mendelssohn's Trio in D minor, Opus 49. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission, the musicians led the audience into the deeper, complex, 
wistful world of Schubert's Trio in E-flat, Opus 100, a work that was given 
exposure on the silver screen when Stanley Kubrick appropriated the second 
movement for endless repetitions during his 1975 film, "Barry Lyndon." 
</P>
<P>
 The work's own internal repetitions and lengths pose challenges to sustain 
interest. The trio met them and triumphed in all cases.

69 Oakland students were evicted after laughing during a showing of Steven 
Spielberg's "Schindler's List," have asked the State Board of Education to 
prove it is implementing a 1992 state law requiring that students in grades 
7-12 be taught about the Holocaust and slavery. Said Katz: "The purpose of this

 Music Prize: Finnish pianist Ralf Gothoni has been named winner of the 
$500,000 Irving S. Gilmore Artist Award, a piano competition so secretive that 
the contestants aren't even aware that they are in the running. The 48-year-old 
Gothoni is the second recipient of the lucrative 2-year-old prize. David 
Pocock, director of Detroit's Gilmore Festival, said award organizers go to 
such lengths to keep the competition secret that they even lured Gothoni to the 
United States last year by arranging a concert in Nashville, so judges could 
secretly assess him. Gothoni will receive about $115,000 in cash and $400,000 
more in management services.

"Forever Plaid" (Jan. 6-22), Paul Osborn's "On Borrowed Time" (March 3-19) and 
"The Wizard of Oz" (April 28-May 14), which probably won't star Rigby, who has

similar American venture out of business. In two months, the Ottawa-based 
Exxxtasy TV has signed up 18,000 U.S. subscribers for its $220-per-year

Assn., a watchdog group that has urged the U.S. Justice Department to pull the 
plug on the service by prosecuting the satellite owner on federal obscenity 
charges. In 1990, a U.S. satellite company also called Exxxtasy closed after it

VIDEO REVIEW; 'FACTS' COUNT AT ANNUAL AFI FESTIVAL; THIS YEAR'S PROGRAM SHOWS A 
CREEPING CNN-IZATION THAT OVERSHADOWS MORE INDIVIDUAL VISIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judging by the dozens of long and short videos on display at the American Film 
Institute's 1994 National Video Festival (starting tonight at 7 and continuing 
through Sunday at various venues on the AFI campus), what videomakers currently 
seem interested in are the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Or at least, their version of the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike past festivals, laden with works blending experiment and fiction 
pushing video closer to feature films, the dominant trend in the '94 crop is 
the report from the front lines, be it Nagorno-Karabah, South-Central L.A. or 
former Soviet military installations. Despite the inclusion of the always 
rule-breaking L.A. Freewaves series of local independent video into this year's 
program, there's a creeping CNN-ization dominating the four days and 
overshadowing the uncategorizable work of signature video artists. 
</P>
<P>
 The marginality of these videomakers is exemplified here by a tribute to the 
late Juan Downey (Saturday, 7 p.m.), whose works such as "Hard Times and 
Culture" showed a genuinely developing vision. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, some startling inventions do pop to the surface. Peggy 
Ahwesh and Margie Strosser's creepy, pulsating "Strange Weather" (billed with 
Terri Hanlon's weak "Inversion of Solitude," 10 a.m., Sunday) is a genuinely 
original fusion of naturalistic drama and choreographed camerawork depicting a 
group of young Florida crack addicts oblivious to the coming onslaught of 
Hurricane Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
 Indicative of how this year's sample of videomaking isn't so much art as about 
art is an assembly of works profiling writers, filmmakers, painters and 
performance artists. "Working With Orson Welles" (at 9:15 tonight) by Welles' 
last cameraman, Gary Graver, is long on anecdotes and short on any perspective 
on Welles' sad, waning career. 
</P>
<P>
 Another portrait of a master, John L. Reilly and Michelle Shaw-Smith's 
"Waiting for Beckett" (7 p.m., Saturday), is sure to stand as one of the 
lasting records of Samuel Beckett's life and work.  
</P>
<P>
 In Saturday's program on Latino artists (12:15 p.m.), Juan Garza's easygoing 
look at one of L.A.'s most vital painters, Gronk, titled "Fascinating 
Slippers," is an uncommon recording of the creative process, while Coco Fusco's 
amusing "Couple in the Cage: A Guatinaui Odyssey" documents how she and 
performance collaborator Guillermo Gomez Pena pulled a creative and cultural 
joke on audiences during a recent touring installation.  
</P>
<P>
 But topical issues are the order of the week, and no topic gets a bigger and 
more slanted examination than L.A.'s April, 1992, riots. Accompanying Elizabeth 
Canner and Julia Meltzer's "State of Emergency: Inside the Los Angeles Police 
Department" is Matt McDaniel's hip-hoppy "Birth of a Nation" (2:45 p.m., 
Saturday), which unconvincingly insists that the riots were actually the start 
of a revolution, while failing to show us where it's going. 
</P>
<P>
 The gutsiest video reporting comes from the former Soviet empire. The festival 
program rightly notes the "decidedly partisan . . . almost unrelievedly grim 
images" in Tsvetana Paskaleva's reports on the war between Armenia and 
Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabah region (10 a.m., Saturday). But few cameras 
have ever gotten as close to the face of war as Paskaleva's, whose Bulgarian 
background helps her understand the suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 More front-line reports come from Russia itself, with a pair of alternately 
boring and provocative Jacob Poselsky videos: "Red Dolphins," about military 
use of dolphins as sea-borne weapons carriers, and "Chemical Weapons in 
Russia," looking inside a former top-secret chemical weapons facility (12:15 
p.m., Sunday). 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of documentary heavyweights here previously aired on TV are Barbara 
Kopple's "Fallen Champ: The Untold Story of Mike Tyson" (7 p.m., Friday) and 
Michael Pack's thoughtful critique of PC on campus, "Campus Culture Wars" (9:15 
p.m., Friday). 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, relief from the hefty issues doesn't come from such sections as the 
Saturday animation program, but from an amusing documentary bill titled 
"Eccentrics" (2:30 p.m., Saturday). It starts with Gary Roma's admirably 
obsessive look at the uses and abuses of doorstops, "Off the Wall and Off the 
Ground," goes on to Berry Minott's gently humanistic "Leonard's Travels" and 
finishes with the festival's funniest hour, "Hawgwild in Sturgis," in which 
videomakers Ken Solomon, Chris Iovenko and Rusty Walden peer inside the ribald, 
nutty subculture of motorcyclists on parade in Sturgis, S.D.

JAZZ REVIEW; DRUMMER AND BASSIST HELP GRAFITTI PUT A FACE ON FUSION

<TEXT>
<P>
 With power drummer Dennis Chambers as the featured performer, fusion group 
Grafitti's opening set Tuesday at Catalina Bar & Grill was a high-decibel 
whirlwind of nonstop rolls, rim shots and cymbal crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Chambers is always a captivating player to watch, with his ability to generate 
a firestorm of percussion while maintaining a relatively cool-looking 
demeanor.Soloing on almost every number, flipping rhythmic bons mots back and 
forth with bassist Gary Grainger, Chambers brought constant fascination to 
Grafitti's funk-driven compositions. In its better moments, his drumming 
recalled both the swirling multi-meters of Elvin Jones and the fiery rhythmic 
preaching of Art Blakey. Without Chambers' perpetual energy and Grainger's 
thumb-popping bass accents, the music might easily have drifted into faceless 
fusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The work of Europeans Haakon Graf on keyboards and Ulf Wakening on guitar 
demonstrated the borderless character of much contemporary jazz. Like so many 
young musicians around the world, their mastery of fusion's rapid-fire 
technical qualities was total. What was missing was any real sense of emotional 
focus or creative individuality. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the vital contributions of Chambers and Grainger, Grafitti's most 
appealing quality was its crisp ensemble work and the engaging modesty of the 
players. Smiling, relaxed and musically interactive, they never fell prey to 
the artificial posturing that plagues many contemporary jazz groups.

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: UCLA TO PRESENT 'NEW ITALIAN CINEMA' SERIES; 'THE BLONDE' 
AND 'MANILA PALOMA BLANCA' ARE AMONG THE OFFERINGS AT THE MELNITZ THEATER 
BEGINNING TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Among the films screening today through Sunday in the UCLA Film Archives' "New 
Italian Cinema" at the university's Melnitz Theater are the very different but 
equally impressive "The Blonde" ("La Bionda") and "Manila Paloma Blanca," which 
play Saturday at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, actor Sergio Rubini made his directorial debut with "The 
Station," a sly charmer about an unprepossessing young stationmaster in a small 
town in Southern Italy who gives shelter to a beautiful but distraught young 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he's back with "The Blonde," once again casting himself as a wistful type, 
a student at a Milanese watch repair school whose life is turned upside down 
when a blond beauty (Nastassja Kinski, as elegant and poised as Catherine 
Deneuve) runs in front of his car and is knocked down, leaving her an amnesiac. 
He's soon captivated by her, but who is she anyway? What if she is to regain 
her memory? 
</P>
<P>
 "Manila Paloma Blanca," a nonsense title, is a one-of-a-kind movie in which 
actor Carlo Colnaghi collaborated with director Daniel Segre in depicting a 
once-renowned stage actor attempting to pull his life together after a decade 
in and out of mental institutions. The zinger here is that the film is loosely 
based on Colnaghi's own experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 When we meet Colnaghi's alter ego, Carlo Carbone, he's relying on medications 
to hold himself together -- more or less. He's intent on writing a theater 
piece for himself and making a comeback on the stage. He's a tall, rangy man of 
manic intensity, mercurial temperament and a strong-featured face like Boris 
Karloff's -- in an instant his expression can change from a benign cragginess 
to outright menace charged with pain and torment. He dares to hope for love and 
rejuvenation when he captures the imagination of an attractive, wealthy woman 
(Alessandra Comerio). 
</P>
<P>
 One is left wondering whether Colnaghi himself could ever regain the stability 
to sustain a return to the stage. Meanwhile, this film -- in which 
Colnaghi/Carbone comments on himself in brief asides shot in black-and-white -- 
allows him to command the screen unforgettably. While the line between the role 
and the actor blurs, Colnaghi makes it clear that we are in the presence of 
great, volcanic talent.

 'Mexican Cinema': On Saturday at the Chaplin Theater at Raleigh Studio, 5300 
Melrose Ave., the American Cinematheque will present "Hecho en Mexico: 
Contemporary Mexican Cinema." The all-day showcase of five films begins at 11 
a.m. with Guita Schyfter's warm, intimate, ironically titled "Bride to Be," a 
highly evocative, richly detailed story of two Jewish girls growing up in the 
1950s and '60s -- and, in the process, developing a resistance to traditional 
expectations. The film is believed to be the first to deal with Mexico's 
long-established Jewish community and its special challenges in co-existing 
with the heavily Catholic majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel Retes' "El Bulto" (1:45 p.m.) is an engaging and persuasive feat of 
the imagination in which Retes stars himself as an activist bludgeoned into a 
coma during a demonstration who awakens 20 years later to find that his radical 
views (combined amusingly with an old-fashioned machismo) clash with his 
family's comfortable bourgeois existence and values. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfonso Cuaron's "Love in the Time of Hysteria" (4:30 p.m.) is a wonderfully 
risque sex farce in which we meet a handsome young Mexico City advertising copy 
writer (Daniel Gimenez Cacho), an incorrigible Don Juan whose doctor routinely 
prescribes an HIV test with a physical exam. Suspense quickly generates as 
Cuaron deftly places a classic screwball comedy in a contemporary context with 
deadly serious implications. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Rotberg's "Angel of Fire" (7:45 p.m.), a lurid allegory of innocence and 
corruption, tells of the spiritual odyssey of a pretty teen-age performer 
(Evangelina Sosa) in a gloriously rag-tag circus. Pregnant by her own father, a 
dying clown, she is defiantly proud of her condition, which gets her thrown out 
of the circus and into the arms of a religious fanatic. Rotberg's tone is so 
relentlessly deadpan, and everything that happens is so ultra-dramatic and 
bizarre that the film becomes darkly humorous, intentionally or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing the series is Guillermo del Toro's horror picture "Cronos," which was 
unavailable for preview. All films will be accompanied by discussions with 
their makers.

ART REVIEWS; FRANK MAJORE'S LESS LURID PHOTOGRAPHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Advertisements are designed to trigger a psychodrama. The goal is to shame, 
seduce and/or deceive the target audience; proclaiming the virtues of a 
particular brand of soap or car is secondary. Of this, Frank Majore is 
well-aware. His photographs luxuriate in the sheen of the advertising image in 
order to crack the code from within -- not with the zeal of a consumer 
advocate, but the cunning of a practiced post-modernist. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '80s, Majore was known for hyper-saturated color prints in which 
martini glasses, lipsticked demi-mondaines and silk sheets floated through 
implied mini-narratives like Madison Avenue-sanctioned apparitions. His new 
photographs at Thomas Solomon's Garage are black and white, and considerably 
less lurid, less va-va-voom. Still, a series called "The Birth of Venus" 
resembles a Vogue spread on the wonders of bubble bath, and a chrysanthemum 
with a string of pearls wrapped around its stalk reads like an ad for 
Mikimoto's top-of-the-line gems. 
</P>
<P>
 Majore's juxtaposition of deep blacks and translucent whites recalls the 
graphic contrasts of Irving Penn, while his minimalist compositions conjure 
those of Paul Outerbridge Jr. Both photographers have been quietly transferred 
from the marketplace to the pantheon. Majore's images suggest that such 
transitions are redundant, for the art historical canon is nothing if not a 
genteel form of advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Majore's cloud photos, which take on Alfred Stieglitz's "Equivalents," play 
with this idea. Vaporous dissolves of white, the images are as complex and 
exquisite as any Symbolist reverie. These are, then, self-conscious exercises 
in one-upsmanship; they proselytize vigorously on behalf of Majore's "genius." 
Here, Majore masquerades as a newer and avowedly "improved" model -- the 
linchpin of many an advertising campaign, as well as the ironic jab of this 
sophisticated project. 
</P>
<P>
 * Frank Majore, Thomas Solomon's Garage, 928 N. Fairfax Ave., (213) 654-4731. 
Ends Saturday. *

 Sounds Like Art: Phyllis Baldino's mechanized playthings at TRI are polite -- 
at least initially. They wait patiently for you to enter the room before they 
begin to perform. Then, spurred into action by motion detectors, they go 
slightly mad, taking you along with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Neon-colored tubes spin, 120 r.p.m. motors whir, and an ungodly sound not 
unlike a chorus of sick whales fills the space. Any 11-year-old would be 
thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldino begins with the plastic tubes children buy at novelty shops, which 
produce a range of sounds when spun in circles. She mounts them to the wall, 
and powers them with motors so that they operate themselves. The ones in the 
front room move with deliberate grace -- a kiddie version of Rebecca Horn's 
mechanized balletics. The ones in the back rotate with manic glee -- and 
generate enough noise to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Baldino wants to go with all this, however, remains muddled. On the one 
hand, she seems to be thinking about the inevitably accelerating pace of 
childhood amusements. On the other, she is concerned with the way kinetic art 
plays upon juvenile desires. Disappointingly, the two thrusts of the work don't 
come together -- or perhaps they come together so obviously one craves 
something more. 
</P>
<P>
 A video installation called "Venice in Berlin in Venice" provides an oblique 
addendum to the exhibition. While visiting Berlin, Baldino discovered that 
footage of people frolicking on the beach in Venice, Calif., often runs on 
late-night German television. Baldino recorded the footage, brought it back to 
the States, played it on a portable monitor set up on Venice Beach, and then 
filmed the purloined footage, returned to its original site. 
</P>
<P>
 More interesting here than the visual conceit is the notion of sound as an 
arbiter of experience -- aesthetic and otherwise. It is the overwhelming din of 
static that cues you to the successive levels of alienation from the real, and 
to the inevitably mediated nature of both fantasy and distraction. If Baldino 
were to focus more directly on sound and the mechanisms of hearing, the work 
might well resonate on more complex -- if less ear-splitting -- levels. 
</P>
<P>
 * Phyllis Baldino, TRI, 1140 S. Hayworth, (213) 936-8255. Open 
Fridays-Sundays, through Feb. 28.

 Entrancing Revelations: Like the pages of a book of poetry, Merion Estes' 
diminutive paintings line the Jan Baum Gallery walls, each one precisely the 
same size, each one offering a minor revelation. Estes infuses her abstractions 
with a lyric beauty that seems -- at least when you are in the thrall of the 
best of them -- infinitely various. Even when you become aware of her habitual 
tropes, it's difficult not to be entranced. 
</P>
<P>
 Estes' technique, like that of Adam Ross, involves building up layers of 
pigment on panel and then sanding selectively, so as to reveal buried patterns, 
networks and meshes of color. Some of the works are marked with highly gestural 
overpainting; others feature sweeping vertical forms on either side which, like 
curtains, heighten the built-in drama. 
</P>
<P>
 The less successful paintings are those in which Estes attempts to conjure a 
female sensibility. These images are pint-sized Helen Frankenthalers -- all 
sunny yellows, luscious corals and tangled skeins of baby pink and blue. The 
problem is that Estes is already working in what amounts to a stereotypically 
"feminine" mode: She makes small, jewel-like objects that are staggeringly 
pretty. Her mandate, it would seem, is to counter such reductionist, 
gender-specific readings, not to reinforce them. To do anything less is naive 
-- and places a limit upon work that has the potential to be far more 
expansive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Merion Estes, Jan Baum Gallery, 170 S. La Brea Ave., (213) 932-0170. Closed 
Sundays and Mondays, through Feb. 26.

<P>
 Smaller Doses Needed: "Dance of the Melissae," Nancy Macko's large-scale 
installation at the Brand Library, literally overwhelms. The sounds include tap 
dancing, Tibetan chants and the swarming of bees; smells include sniffing vases 
filled with coriander and lavender; and visuals -- wooden panels incorporating 
beeswax, votives filled with pussy willows, cave-style wall drawings 
celebrating early honey gatherers, and the "Stations of the Goddess," featuring 
ritualistic items like dial-an-herb wheels, accouterments for inhaling pollen, 
and antique bee smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of bombardment is Macko's way of initiating us into a cult -- 
indeed, a cosmology -- in which the sensual, rather than the rational or the 
punitive, prevails. This is a world infused with a feminine spirit; and bees, 
which Macko refers to at various points in the installation as "souls of 
nymphs," "priestesses of the goddess" and "symbols of regeneration," are its 
reigning metaphor. 
</P>
<P>
 Macko is a fine artist, yet in many ways, she sets herself up. She hits the 
viewer with everything she's got -- with sledgehammer-like intensity. One finds 
oneself edging away, and latching onto the less didactic elements -- the 
cocktail dress, hat and gloves of a "modern-day bee-priestess"; a gold razor 
blade for cutting lines of powdered pollen; a Pepsi-stamped baby bottle filled 
with honey. Like honey itself, Macko's work is highly concentrated and most 
effective -- and affecting -- in small doses. Perhaps at this point, an 
operation as rational and punitive as editing is what is called for. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nancy Macko, Brand Library and Art Galleries, 1601 W. Mountain St., 
Glendale, (818) 548-2050. Closed Sundays, through Feb. 19.

TV REVIEW; '94 'I SPY' LEAVES COSBY, CULP UP A CREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A little more than a quarter-century after the last episode of "I Spy" aired, 
Bill Cosby and Robert Culp are partnered again. They spend a little less time 
actually spying than doing their "Grumpy Old Men" act, in which many 
self-conscious nods are made to how much time and thinness has passed in the 
interval. 
</P>
<P>
 "The walls of ivory seem to agree with you," Culp tells Cosby, who has retired 
from spydom to become a college professor. "You have that happy Buddha look." 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you," says Cos, whose physique indeed belies a more sedentary 
lifestyle. "Is that a hairpiece?" 
</P>
<P>
 And is that dust on this script, which resorts all too readily to cliches 
about aging action heroes who comically huff and puff on their way to 
breathlessly closing the case? For anyone awaiting the sitcom version of "In 
the Line of Fire," the TV movie "I Spy Returns" (on CBS, Channels 2 and 8, 
tonight at 8) happily steps into the breach. 
</P>
<P>
 Old-fashioned Commies do figure into the villainous mix here, but these two 
aren't fighting the Cold War, they're fighting the Cute War. 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out Cosby's daughter has joined the secret government agency that Dad 
once belonged to, unbeknown to him. When he finds out and makes an angry visit 
to Culp (now a high agency muck-a-muck) to protest, Cosby learns his daughter 
has been teamed with Culp's son. These two doting dads can't resist tagging 
along on the kids' first mission in Vienna, where, inevitably, routine 
surveillance of a defecting Russian biologist turns into a world-saving affair. 
</P>
<P>
 They spy; I sigh. You get paunch jokes aplenty, '70s-style car-chase climaxes 
and neat lessons about the complementarity of youth and experience, despite the 
comically intended ineptitude of all ages here. 
</P>
<P>
 Cosby at least has a natural way with the drollery attempted, and the fleeting 
amusement he affords offers a glimpse of how much fun a 25-year reunion 
could've been had he (as executive producer) commissioned a brighter script. 
Culp, meanwhile, overcompensatingly attacks the creaky gags more than he 
invests himself in them, and it's hard to blame him. The dully drawn offspring 
hardly register, despite their ample screen time, circumventing the likelihood 
of any "Next Generation" sequels.

NEWS BITES: PRAISE PERFECT PINT, PROCURE PUB

<TEXT>
<P>
 The contest sounds easy: Describe your perfect pint of Guinness stout and you 
may win your very own Irish pub. But the contest, sponsored by the Guinness 
company, has a catch.The week of May 15, the 10 U.S. finalists (age 21 or 
older) will be flown, all expenses covered, to Connie Doolan's Pub in Cobh, 
County Cork, to compete (here's the catch) in a second set of contests, lasting 
a week. Among them are pint pouring (hitting the glass is recommended), darts 
and "other pub games," says a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Uh, there's still another catch. The spokesman says the 10 finalists must also 
give "an oral essay." (No word on whether this will be after consuming a pint 
of Guinness, but it stands to reason.) A panel including reputable Irish 
publicans will judge and the winner will receive title to Connie Doolan's pub. 
</P>
<P>
 If the grand prize winner can't take title to the pub, he or she may accept a 
substitute award of $100,000. Essays of 50 words or less must be postmarked by 
March 24 and addressed to Guinness Win Your Own Pub Contest, PMI Station, P.O.

LOW FAT; AS LIGHT AS LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA DEANE, TIMES FOOD STYLIST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is the time of year when cooks in love start thinking of sweet ways to 
please a valentine. But what if the object of your affection is on a diet? One 
solution: meringue-filled chocolate crepes. These, for instance, each have just 
4 grams of fat. 
</P>
<P>
 And because we live in an age of limits, this recipe can be made ahead to 
eliminate last-minute preparation (of course, they're all the better if you can 
make them to order). Prepare the crepe batter a day ahead and cook the crepes 
several hours before serving. Wrap the cooked crepes in plastic wrap until 
you're ready to finish them. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce excess fat, cook the crepes in a non-stick skillet sprayed with 
butter-flavored non-stick cooking spray or very lightly brush the skillet with 
clarified butter. Turn the crepe when it is golden brown and cook the other 
side very quickly, just enough to set the crepe. Use about two tablespoons of 
batter for each crepe to keep them as thin and delicate as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The meringue must be prepared just before serving. Cream of tartar is added to 
the egg whites to stabilize them so the meringue doesn't collapse after baking. 
For each crepe spoon two generous tablespoons of meringue along one half of 
each crepe and fold over. The crepes are done when they are puffed and the 
meringue is lightly browned around the edges. Sprinkle each with almonds, 
powdered sugar and cocoa. 
</P>
<P>
 VALENTINE CREPES 3/4 cup flour Granulated sugar 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 
teaspoon salt 1 cup nonfat milk 1/4 cup nonfat egg substitute (equivalent to 1 
egg) 1 tablespoon butter, melted Vanilla 3 tablespoons grated bittersweet 
chocolate 3 egg whites 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar 1/4 cup chopped toasted 
almonds Powdered sugar Cocoa Shaved chocolate Berry Sauce 
</P>
<P>
 Combine flour, 1 tablespoon granulated sugar, baking powder and salt in bowl. 
In separate bowl, stir together milk, egg substitute, melted butter and 1/2 
teaspoon vanilla. Stir liquids into dry ingredients just until blended. Stir in 
grated chocolate. Let stand 1 hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Spray non-stick cooking spray in non-stick 6-inch skillet and heat over medium 
heat. Ladle in 2 tablespoons batter. Rotate and tip pan quickly so batter 
evenly covers bottom of crepe pan. Cook until underside is lightly browned. 
Flip crepe and cook just until set. Remove to paper towels. Repeat until all 
batter is used. 
</P>
<P>
 Beat egg whites with cream of tartar to soft peaks. Gradually beat in 6 
tablespoons granulated sugar until stiff peaks form. Beat in 1/4 teaspoon 
vanilla. Spoon about 2 heaping tablespoons meringue onto 1/2 of each crepe. 
Sprinkle over 1/2 teaspoon almonds. Fold over crepe. 
</P>
<P>
 Place filled crepes on baking sheet and bake at 400 degrees 3 to 5 minutes, 
just until meringue is puffed and browned around edges. After crepes have 
baked, sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon almonds over top of each, then sprinkle with 
powdered sugar and cocoa. Garnish with few pieces of shaved chocolate. Serve 
with Berry Sauce. Makes 12 crepes. 
</P>
<P>
 Each crepe contains about: 139 calories; 104 mg sodium; 3 mg cholesterol; 4 
grams fat; 22 grams carbohydrates; 4 grams protein; 1.12 grams fiber. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Berry Sauce 2 cups raspberries 3 tablespoons sugar 2 tablespoons raspberry 
liqueur 1/4 cup blackberries 
</P>
<P>
 Puree 1 3/4 cups of raspberries with sugar. Stir in liqueur. Stir in 
blackberries and remaining 1/4 cup raspberries. Makes about 1 3/4 cups sauce.

CHECK CHECKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Benoit Gateau-Cumin suggests that after Tom Keller left Checkers we haven't 
heard anything about (the restaurant) ("Conversations with a Headhunter," Jan. 
20). This would seem to imply that Checkers has become a mediocre, average 
place to dine. 
</P>
<P>
 This implication needs to be corrected since Checkers is alive and well and, 
in my opinion as a regular patron, provides some of the best and most creative 
food in Los Angeles. The chef who replaced Keller, William Valentine, has done 
an excellent job of maintaining and even exceeding the standards set by Keller 
and his predecessor, Jerry Comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 Checkers has been featured in your own Los Angeles Times magazine. A recent 
issue of Gourmet featured Checkers' Thanksgiving dinner and contained a brief 
interview with chef Valentine. Both the 1993 and 1994 Zagat guides have 
Checkers as one of the top 50 restaurants in the Los Angeles area. Checkers was 
also one of the top five restaurants in the guide serving California-style food 
and was one of the top three places for brunch in Los Angeles. It was voted one 
of the top romantic restaurants and also was one of the top 15 restaurants in 
regard to decor. 
</P>
<P>
 With the above in mind, it is difficult to believe that someone who claims to 
be in the business could state that we haven't heard anything about Checkers 
since Keller left.

 "As Good as Gold: Grand Prize Recipes From America's Cooking Contests," by 
Linda Davis-O'Brien (published by As Good As Gold, St. Michaels, Md.), gives 
more than 150 recipes that won prizes at contests -- everything from the 
Pillsbury Bake-Off to the National Pineapple Cooking Classic. But that's not 
all; it also contains chapters on recipe contest history and trivia, and . . . 
information on how to win recipe contests. In book stores. Bag That Coffee

 In case you haven't noticed, the latest convenience idea is coffee bags, which 
are just like tea bags only . . . well, you know. Maxwell House's Filter Pack 
Singles, for instance, are filled with a mixture of ground coffee and instant 
coffee. Another line, Cafe de Todd Gourmet Coffee Singles, is made entirely 
from ground coffee, with no instant, so it's more aromatic when you open the 
foil packet. Neither will replace espresso, but there are a lot of occasions 
(such as hiking) where you can't exactly carry an espresso machine. In

 If the idea of making your own cheese has ever occurred to you, you'll find 
this catalogue fascinating. It offers kits for making simple things like 
mascarpone (the rich tiramisu cheese) or fromage blanc (for the luscious French 
dessert coeur a la creme ), on up to hard cheeses like Cheddar, Stilton or even 
Swiss -- complete with holes. (Hard cheeses require much more commitment; 
you've got to get a cheese press, which runs $199.95.) There are also starters 
and equipment for making yogurt, kefir, creme fraiche and buttermilk. "Catalog 
of Supplies for Cheese Making" catalogue is $1 from New England Cheesemaking

 Health Sea, Inc. markets Silverbow salmon "ham," alderwood-smoked so it tastes 
like Canadian bacon (well, plus a little salmon flavor), only with the health 
advantages of fish, such as a total of 1% fat. The regular salmon ham comes in 
a collagen casing that makes it look just like a baby ham; the deli style uses 
a different casing which allows it to receive kosher certification from the 
Chicago Rabbinical Council. Available at Hughes, Bristol Farms and Phil's 
markets. Answer Time

 Answers to your top questions about recent Newsbites: Where to get Evert-Fresh 
vegetable bags? For the moment, health food stores such as Whole Foods Stores. 
Where to get the Bonny pepper mill? Target Stores. Why we gave SAUCES1, the 
(800) number of Specialty Sauces' (barbecue and Mexican sauces from famous 
restaurants), as 728-1271 instead of 728-2371? Might have been an aftershock.

COFFEE TALK; THE FRUSTRATING MECHANICS OF A CUP OF JOE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "In light of all the difficulties of making a good cup of coffee in the 19th 
Century," says Ian Bersten, "I really don't know why coffee-drinking 
continued." 
</P>
<P>
 Bersten, an ultra-jovial Australian and all-around coffee guy ("If you can put 
the word coffee in front of it, I've done it: roaster, grinder, brewer, shop 
owner"), has written a huge volume -- something between a scholarly study and 
a, well, coffee-table book -- on the history and technology of tea and coffee, 
entitled "Coffee Floats, Tea Sinks." 
</P>
<P>
 The name sums up the problem. Coffee grounds, buoyed by gases formed in 
roasting, float when hot water is added, while tea leaves immediately get wet 
and sink. When you're making coffee, you have to find some way of getting the 
water into the grounds so that you can brew the flavor, but before the bitter 
tannin starts to be extracted. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are always saying coffee never tastes as good as it smells," Bersten 
points out. "They never say that about tea." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the coffee-making inventions that the 19th Century produced so 
enthusiastically missed the mark most of the time. At that time, the French 
were at the center of coffee innovation, but their leading thinker, Antoine 
Alexis Cadet-de-Vaux, believed coffee should be "brewed" with cold water the 
day before and then heated up. "That would absolutely guarantee a bitter cup," 
says Bersten. 
</P>
<P>
 And wrong theories were only the beginning of coffee-lovers' troubles 150 
years ago. Bersten ticks off the problems: Roasting equipment was primitive, so 
coffee must often have had either a flat or a burnt flavor. The coffee itself 
was likely to be stale (beans were stored in leather pouches sealed with 
grease) or adulterated with chicory, acorns, figs or used grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Often the beans were physically damaged. Seawater turned them gray outside and 
green inside, and fresh water turned them white and smelly, so coffee merchants 
dyed them with rust, indigo or beef blood (caramelized in sulfuric acid), or 
glazed them with eggs or gelatin. An 1845 Dutch coffee-roasting recipe included 
cocoa beans, lemon pips, cinnamon and bread to improve the aroma, and added: 
"If the coffee has been damaged in any way, evidenced by false color, take out 
the bread and replace with onions. When the coffee is half-roasted, take out 
the onions, add two cloves and one peppercorn and continue roasting." 
</P>
<P>
 On top of all that, it was impossible to grind coffee properly. "You never 
read, 'Use fine grind' in 19th-Century writings," says Bersten. "Their grinders 
didn't have sharp enough cutting faces. The necessary precision was beyond 
their technology." He has scores of antique coffee grinders, and none of them 
can grind fine, so they would have made coffee that was either weak or bitter 
or both. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did people keep on drinking coffee? "Maybe," Bersten speculates, "it's 
the fact that coffee always smells good when it's just ground, even when badly 
roasted. This may have been the only thing that kept coffee-drinking going. It 
must have set up a Pavlovian conditioning." In our own time, coffee 
advertisements have often shown people delighting in the smell that comes out 
of a can of coffee when it's first opened, rather than in the aroma of the cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Back up there a second. Bersten owns scores of antique coffee grinders? Yes, 
scores, and hundreds of coffee makers, dating back as far as 1790. "I keep my 
antiques all over," he says, "150 in the dining room, 400 under the house, 200 
in the garage, crates of stuff in my factory. I'm building a 600-square-foot 
museum on top of my house in Sydney." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of photographs from this obsessional collection, together with 
diagrams from various European patent offices, fill his book, providing an 
oddly impressive view of human ingenuity at its most hopeful, deluded and 
downright cranky. All the designs were dealing with the same problem: It can 
take water as long as five minutes to penetrate to the center of the "foam bed" 
of floating coffee grounds, but the bitter tannin starts being extracted in 
about 45 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 What can you do about this? You can just pour hot water over the grounds and 
either accept the bitterness, as with Turkish coffee or cowboy coffee, or try 
to pour the liquid off the grounds before it gets too bitter. Probably most 
coffee was made in some such rough-and-ready way in the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Or you can push the spent grounds away from the water, as in the French 
plunger pot. This makes a good cup, Bersten says, if you make sure to stir the 
grounds so that they break up and start brewing quickly. (The plunger idea goes 
back to 1852, but like fine grinding, it was an idea ahead of its time. It 
wasn't until this century that we had the technology to make a plunger that 
actually separated all the grounds from the brew.) 
</P>
<P>
 All the other methods involve moving water through the grounds; for instance, 
letting it drip through a filter. The idea of filtered coffee goes back to the 
17th Century, and the world has seen porcelain filters, sock-shaped cloth 
filters, paper filters and even gold filters. Bersten says that if you pour 
boiling-hot water into a filter from the height of a foot or so, it 
conveniently cools down to the 198- to 205-degree range that makes the best 
coffee, so if you're careful to stir up the floating grounds so they brew, a 
filter can make good coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 The main problems with the drip method have always been the need to clean the 
filters all the time (unless they're disposable) and the inconvenience of 
having to pour the water onto the grounds. Even 200 years ago, people were 
already longing for an automatic coffee maker. 
</P>
<P>
 So the reversible filter coffee maker was invented. You boiled the water in 
one compartment, turned the device upside down and let the water drip through 
the coffee into another compartment. The 19th Century also created the pumping 
percolator, where the steam pressure of the boiling water forced it up a tube 
so that it dripped onto a filter full of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 The usual American percolator, a design that was patented in France in 1838, 
is technically a recirculating pumping percolator. Coffee purists despise it, 
because the brewed coffee continually returns to the chamber where the water is 
boiling, thereby losing its aroma into the air. Some people consider the 
American percolator basically a way of perfuming a house. After all, as Bersten 
points out, this is the only country in the world that uses the expression, 
"Wake up and smell the coffee." 
</P>
<P>
 Others dismiss the American percolator as evidence that Americans are suckers 
for anything that seems technological, but Bersten happens to disagree. In the 
19th Century, American authors had traditionally recommended horrifically long 
brewing times -- half an hour or more. "I think the American use of the 
percolator was a defense against bitter coffee," he says. "It uses a coarse 
grind, so there's less extraction of tannin." If the aroma mostly went into the 
air, well, it mostly went into the air with a lot of other 19th-Century 
coffee-brewing methods too. 
</P>
<P>
 The American love affair with the percolator continues, of course. "There's a 
wider range of coffee quality in the U.S. than any other country," says 
Bersten. "In most countries, there's a basic standard of quality around which 
all coffee revolves. But here you have both percolated lunch counter swill and 
exquisite espresso coffees." 
</P>
<P>
 Drip and percolator methods make relatively watery coffee. To make a stronger 
cup, the key is to force the water through the grounds. Then there can be a 
fair race between the brewing of flavor and the extraction of bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
 The earliest method, says Bersten, was the vacuum pot, first mentioned in 
1827. For this, the hot water is forced up onto the coffee by steam pressure, 
then the heat source is removed and the condensing steam creates a partial 
vacuum, which sucks the water back through the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The next method was the earliest sort of espresso, known as the "long" 
espresso (because it takes two minutes or longer to brew a cup), which is still 
used in stove-top espresso devices such as the Bialetti Moka. Here the boiling 
water is forced through the grounds by steam pressure from the boiling chamber 
-- direct steam pressure, rather than a vacuum. An 1837 design, invented by a 
French optician named Lebrun, was still being manufactured in the early 20th 
Century. You poured alcohol around the rim and lit it, and the heat drove the 
water through the coffee and out a little curved pipe. "It wasn't what we'd 
call espresso today," Bersten says. "It would have produced something a little 
stronger than filtered coffee." 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble with both vacuum and steam espresso methods is that the coffee 
grounds have to be tamped fairly tight into some sort of filter box or the 
water merely passes around them, rather than penetrating them. But coffee 
grounds swell up when they are wetted, and the 19th-Century machines were 
nowhere near as sturdy as the brewing basket of a modern espresso maker. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a high risk of explosion in all these models unless they had safety 
valves," says Bersten, "and a lot of them didn't. They could have been 
table-top grenades. Some patents point out that their design 'represents a 
distinct advance because it won't explode.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It's at this stage of coffee-maker evolution that the most gloriously absurd 
machines were invented. There were Loysel's gas-heated machines, which combined 
espresso and vacuum principles -- they pushed the water up through the grounds 
into a pot above, then sucked the brewed coffee back through the grounds by 
vacuum. Loysel's 8-foot-tall machine was the hit of the 1855 Paris Exposition. 
He eventually built one 11 feet high, the tallest coffee maker ever. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1872, a woman named Eriberta Predari invented a vacuum pot that boiled an 
egg while it made coffee. Other inventors hid pumping percolators in tabletop 
brewers that looked like toy locomotive engines. One of the most efficient 
19th-Century machines, says Bersten, was Eicke's 1878 model: An alcohol flame 
boiled the water, driving it into a coffee brewing apparatus on the other end 
of a balancing arm. When the coffee was brewed, it overweighed the boiler, 
which tipped up, releasing a lid that snuffed out the flame. Voila ! An 
automatic coffee maker! (In 1895, a man named Hertmann perfected this idea by 
setting up a clock to strike a match and light the alcohol burner at a 
predetermined hour -- the first real wake-up-and-smell-the-coffee machine.) 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until after World War II that the final development in coffee 
brewing was perfected, the true or short espresso (so called because it brews 
in a shorter time than the long espresso). In this method the water is forced 
through the grounds by mechanical force, such as an electric pump, rather than 
by steam. At last, water could be forced through the coffee grounds in 30 
seconds, safely before tannin extraction.  
</P>
<P>
 And not only that. Freed from their dependence on steam, coffee makers could 
experiment to discover the perfect water temperature (198-205 degrees) and the 
perfect pressure (nine atmospheres) for brewing. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a kind of coffee that had never existed before. Because of the 
high water pressure used in making true espresso, says Bersten, about 10% of 
the oils in the grounds become emulsified, and the aromas attach themselves to 
the oils. So espresso is more fragrant than other coffees, and has more body 
and roundness in the mouth. The crema or layer of foam on top of an espresso, 
by the way, consists of very tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide forced out of the 
grounds by water pressure, and it retards the evaporation of the coffee aroma. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bersten's opinion, we are now living in a golden age of coffee: "In the 
15th Century and for a long time afterward, people referred to coffee as a 
bitter beverage. Today there are 200 ways of making good coffee."  
</P>
<P>
 But he has nowhere near as sanguine a view of the coffee trade. "The coffee 
business has made an art form of raising barriers against information," he 
says. "Roasters try to keep you out. And they don't really understand what 
they're doing themselves."  
</P>
<P>
 His own first experience with this came when he was exploring the idea of 
opening an espresso shop in Australia 25 years ago: "When I asked a coffee 
seller for raw coffee beans, he pushed me down the stairs." To Bersten, who was 
trained as an economist, it was obvious that the markup on roasted beans had to 
be lucrative. He decided that day to go into the coffee-roasting business. 
Collecting information on coffee-making science, and coffee antiques, followed 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 And an all-around irreverent attitude toward coffee commonplaces. The decaf 
craze, for instance. "Coffee is everybody's whipping boy," he says. "Nobody 
says anything about the caffeine in tea or aspirin or cocoa -- and we think 
cocoa is a drink to give children." 
</P>
<P>
 Bersten does like tea, though, and his book has photographs of about 70 
teapots. The contrast with coffee makers is remarkable. Coffee equipment tends 
to look like industrial machinery, while teapots often have cozy, whimsical 
designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, of course -- tea sinks. There's been no need for technological advance 
in tea brewing for thousands of years. "Tea is so easy to make," he says, "it 
has no mystery. That may be why teapots often have fanciful shapes. You never 
find a coffeepot with a face painted on it."

BACK TO BASICS: HOT STICKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Until recently, I'd never met a potsticker I didn't like. That, however, was 
before I ordered them at a Chinese restaurant in the small town where I now 
live. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs announced, "We now have potstickers," so I placed an order and waited 
expectantly. What arrived at the table looked familiar, but it had a texture 
reminiscent of rubber. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to be an accomplished Chinese cook to make better dumplings 
than those, no matter where you live. 
</P>
<P>
 The wrappers can be bought already prepared in any Chinese market (if you 
can't find wrappers specifically made for potstickers, simply trim the corners 
of won-ton wrappers with scissors). The filling can simply be seasoned pork 
sausage, or ground pork combined with finely minced green onions, water 
chestnuts and fresh ginger, with soy sauce and sesame oil for flavoring. 
Carrots, cabbage and shrimp also make good additions. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with one potsticker skin at a time, dip your finger in water and 
lightly moisten the skin about 1/4 inch in from the edge all the way around 
(Step 1). Place a rounded teaspoon of the sausage mixture in the center (Step 
2). 
</P>
<P>
 Fold the skin over the filling (Step 3) and pinch it closed at the center of 
the arc. Working to one side of the center at a time, seal the edges by making 
three or four pleats toward the center (Step 4). As you work, the dumpling will 
form a flat-bottomed crescent with pleats along the top. 
</P>
<P>
 The potstickers may also be formed with a small press (Step 5), available at 
cookware stores. The directions tell you to place the wrapper on the open 
press, add the filling in the center, moisten the edge, then fold the press 
over. This method is a lot quicker, and the resulting shape is very similar 
(Step 6). 
</P>
<P>
 Potstickers are cooked by a combination of pan-frying and steaming. This 
causes the bottoms to stick slightly to the pan -- thus their name. Getting the 
right amount of "stick" without tearing the dumplings when removing them from 
the pan takes a little practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The dumplings should be cooked in a heavy or non-stick 12-inch skillet that 
has a tight-fitting lid. Place it over medium-high heat, then add enough oil to 
generously coat the bottom of the pan. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrange the potstickers close together in a circle around the edge of the pan 
with the pleated edges up (Step 7). If they don't all fit, a few can also be 
placed in the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook them until the bottoms begin to brown (Step 8), then add the water 
carefully to prevent spattering (Step 9). Immediately cover the pan, reduce the 
heat to medium and cook until the potstickers are puffed and the liquid is 
nearly evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove the lid and increase the heat again to medium-high. After the liquid 
boils away and the potstickers begin to sizzle in the remaining oil, continue 
cooking until the bottoms become crisp and browned (Step 10), adding a small 
amount of oil if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompany the dumplings with soy sauce, chile oil and hot Chinese mustard. 
POTSTICKERS 1/4 pound ground pork 2 tablespoons finely minced green onions 2 
tablespoons finely minced water chestnuts 1 tablespoon finely minced ginger 
root 1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil 18 potsticker 
skins Oil 3/4 cup water or diluted chicken stock Soy sauce, chile oil and hot 
Chinese mustard 
</P>
<P>
 Combine pork, green onions, water chestnuts, ginger, soy sauce and sesame oil. 
Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Place 1 potsticker skin at time on work surface. Lightly moisten around entire 
edge with small amount of water, then place 1 rounded teaspoon pork mixture in 
center of skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Fold skin over filling and pinch closed at center of arc. Working to 1 side of 
center at time, seal edges by making 3 to 4 pleats toward center. Dumpling will 
form flat-bottomed crescent with pleats across top. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat 12-inch heavy or non-stick skillet with tight-fitting lid over 
medium-high heat. Add enough oil to coat bottom of pan generously. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrange potstickers close together in circle around edge of pan, pleated edges 
up. Cook until bottoms begin to brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Add water carefully to prevent spattering and immediately cover pan. Reduce 
heat to medium and cook 6 to 8 minutes, until potstickers are puffed and liquid 
is nearly evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove lid and increase heat to medium-high. Cook until liquid boils away and 
potstickers begin to sizzle in remaining oil, then continue cooking until 
bottoms become crisp and browned, adding small amount of oil if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Serve with soy sauce, sesame-chile oil and hot Chinese mustard. Makes 18 
potstickers.

GOOD COOKING: VEGETARIAN SPICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It takes creativity to make low-fat and vegetarian foods as compelling as 
those laced with fat, which automatically boosts flavor. And certainly this 
kind of cooking is difficult to find in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 But the home cook has plenty of options. Consider this spicy vegetable curry. 
The sauce is made without an additional thickener -- meaning the flavors are 
clear and bright. You can use whatever vegetables you like, as long as you end 
up with six cups total. I used two (16-ounce) bags of frozen mixed broccoli, 
cauliflower and carrots, and when cooked until just tender, they were more than 
satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
 The best thing about this dish is that it can be completely cooked in less 
than 45 minutes, assuming that the sauce and rice cook concurrently and that 
the processor is used for mincing, chopping and slicing.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For convenience, this sauce can be made ahead and frozen. Vegetables work very 
well with this sauce, but for a non-vegetarian meal, cooked seafood, chicken or 
meat -- especially leftovers -- go just as well. Ladle over hot Rice With Green 
Onions and Cilantro and pass Cucumbers in Yogurt Sauce and chutney separately.  
</P>
<P>
 SPICY VEGETABLE CURRY 1 tablespoon oil 2 large cloves garlic, minced 1 
jalapeno chile, seeded if desired, minced 2 small onions, chopped 1 large 
carrot, scrubbed, chopped 1 Granny Smith apple, peeled, chopped 3 to 5 
teaspoons curry powder, Madras preferred 1/4 cup tomato paste 2 cups cider 2 
cups vegetable bouillon 1 teaspoon salt Freshly ground pepper 2 (16-ounce) bags 
frozen mixed broccoli, cauliflower and carrots, cooked according to 
instructions (about 6 cups), well drained 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add 
garlic, jalapeno, onions, carrot and apple. Cook until onions are tender, about 
4 minutes. Add curry powder, tomato paste, cider, bouillon, salt and pepper to 
taste. Stir to combine. Simmer, uncovered, until thickened, about 12 minutes, 
stirring occasionally. Can be made 2 days ahead to this point and refrigerated, 
or frozen as long as 3 months. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, combine sauce and vegetables and heat through. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>

 Each serving contain about: 245 calories; 553 mg sodium; trace cholesterol; 3 
grams fat; 34 grams carbohydrates; 16 grams protein; 2.4 grams fiber.

</P>
<P>
 Vegetable bouillon does add flavor to the rice but if you can't find it, 
substitute the same quantity of water and two teaspoons of salt. If you are 
making the rice ahead of time, add the green onions and cilantro just before 
serving.  
</P>
<P>
 RICE WITH GREEN ONIONS AND CILANTRO 3 cups vegetable bouillon 1 cup water 2 
cups rice 6 large green onions, thinly sliced 3 tablespoons minced fresh

</P>
<P>
 Bring bouillon and water to boil. Add rice. Stir well. Simmer, covered, until 
liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Let covered rice stand 10 minutes. Can be 
made day ahead and refrigerated. Gently reheat in double boiler or microwave 
oven. Add green onions and cilantro. Fluff with fork. Serve hot. Makes 6 
servings.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: QUESADILLA SERA, SERA  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the most intriguingly mixed neighborhoods in Los Angeles is that bit of 
Beverly Boulevard stretching west a few blocks from Vermont, where Koreatown 
and the Filipino neighborhood to the east crash headlong into the giant Central 
American community that stretches up into Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 I first hung out in the neighborhood, paused to map it and to understand its 
rhythms, for a cultural-geography paper my freshman year at UCLA, and though 
most of the actual businesses have changed, the essential tune has not. It's 
not a bad place for a Saturday afternoon food stroll, punctuated perhaps by a 
grilled Thai lemon-grass sausage from the pushcart in the parking lot of the 
Cathay supermarket, a cheese-stuffed pupusa from the Salvadoran place called 
Usulateco, an Indonesian coffee-avocado smoothie from the restaurant Agung, a 
super-caffeinated Cuban soft drink from the pan-Latin El Lechero market. 
</P>
<P>
 If you spend enough time around here, you are bound to discover the 
Guatemalteca Bakery, which more or less seems to be the locus of the large 
Guatemalan community in central Los Angeles. On the sidewalk in front, street 
vendors sell fuzzy stuffed apes and banda cassettes, homemade tamales and hot 
ears of corn. On Sundays and before holidays, the line at Guatemalteca often 
twists through the bakery, out onto the sidewalk and most of the way down the 
block, because Guatemalteca's soft white roll, perujo , is about the best 
Central American bread you can find. Even on a midweek afternoon, people line 
up for the rolls and cakes and super-sweet custard-filled pastries, along with 
maybe a bottle of hot sauce and a pound of herbed Guatemalan sausage links, 
longanizas . 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite thing to buy here is a sort of oblong, cream-cheese-enriched 
Guatemalan poundcake, quesadilla , which is sweet, rich and even better when 
you take it home and heat it up for breakfast. For a long time, Guatemalteca 
quesadillas were among my standard contributions to potluck dinners, and over 
the years I've experimented with quesadilla strawberry shortcake, toasted 
quesadillas with ice cream, and rum-soaked quesadilla bread pudding.  
</P>
<P>
 Next to the bakery, Guatemalteca runs a quick-service restaurant specializing 
in $4 steam-table lunches and the Guatemalan antojito -like snacks called 
chapines . The plate lunches here are pretty much what you might expect, the 
chunky, tart beef stew carne guisada and the tomato-y shredded-beef stew 
hilacha , intensely flavored longaniza sausages in tomato sauce that are better 
the fresher they are from the grill.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the terminology can be confusing here: What the restaurant calls a 
tostada , you'll call a fried tortilla smeared with beans, and what you might 
recognize as a tostada -- a crisp tortilla heaped with beans, cream, and a 
bright-purple mixture of beets and beet-stained cabbage -- Guatemalans call an 
enchilada . An enchilada might be the essential Guatemalteca snack. Tamales are 
the soft, airy kind, steamed in banana leaves, fluffed out with lard, filled 
with chunks of chile-stewed pork, and the flavor is terrific, but the texture 
might be a bit off-putting if you're used to the firmer Mexican tamales. 
</P>
<P>
 The fairly bland steam-table food may sometimes remind you of what a 
Woolworth's lunch counter might serve in Guatemala City, but I fairly often 
find myself stopping in here for a quick bite: fried plantains with black beans 
and thick Guatemalan cream, a delicious, simple sandwich of black beans on a 
roll, rellenitos , which is essentially sweet fried plantains wrapped around 
salty black beans. They like black beans here, and they know how to use them. 
</P>

daily. Cash only. No alcohol. Street parking. Takeout. Lunch for two, $8.

MASHED POTATOES: BRING ON THE GOAT CHEESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY ROSBOTTOM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walking past stands laden with produce at the Union Square green market in New 
York City recently, I came upon a crowd huddled around a chef. It was a cooking 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 A fellow onlooker handed me a bright-orange paper with the cook's recipes 
printed on it, but since I was in a hurry, I didn't look at the sheet until 
later that day, on the train home. Immediately an intriguing recipe for mashed 
potatoes, created by Lloyd Feit of Cafe Loup on West 13th Street, caught my 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
 The potatoes (Yukon Gold or red skin) were boiled, peeled, mashed and combined 
with sauteed shallots, crumbled goat cheese, milk and herbs. The dish can be 
assembled and set aside up to the point where the herbs are added. At serving 
time, the potatoes can be quickly heated and then stirred up with chopped fresh 
thyme, chives and parsley. 
</P>
<P>
 I made the potatoes for some friends later that week -- they all helped 
themselves to huge second servings. A roast leg of lamb would be terrific with 
the potatoes -- so would roast chicken or grilled steaks. Or you might like to 
include it as part of an all-vegetable fall supper. CAFE LOUP'S MASHED POTATOES 
WITH SHALLOTS, GOAT CHEESE AND HERBS 2 teaspoons olive oil 3/4 cup peeled and 
chopped shallots 2 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold or red skin potatoes, scrubbed but 
unpeeled 6 to 8 ounces soft goat cheese, crumbled 1 cup low-fat milk, heated 
until warm 3/4 teaspoon salt Freshly ground white or black pepper 1 tablespoon 
chopped thyme 1 tablespoon chopped chives 1 tablespoon chopped parsley Sprigs 
of fresh herbs to taste, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add shallots and 
saute, stirring, until tender and light-golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from 
heat and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring large pan of water to boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender, 30 to 40 
minutes, depending on size of potatoes. Drain. When cool enough to handle, peel 
potatoes. Puree potatoes in food mill or mash with wooden spoon or masher. Do 
not use food processor, which will make potatoes gluey. Stir in shallots, 
cheese and warm milk. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer mixture to 
buttered baking dish. 
</P>
<P>
 (Potatoes can be prepared day ahead to this point. Cover and refrigerate. When 
ready to use, heat in microwave on HIGH power several minutes, depending on 
microwave oven, until hot. Or heat in covered baking dish at 350 degree 15 to 
25 minutes in conventional oven.) 
</P>
<P>
 Stir in thyme, chives and parsley. Adjust seasonings to taste. Serve hot in 
dish, garnished with bundle of fresh herbs. Makes 6 servings.

GARDEN FRESH; LESSONS OF LEEKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In times when life is lived zip-zip-zip, it is comforting to slow down. My 
garden forces me to. It has much to teach in the ways of patience and humility. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Leeks, in particular, are a lesson. The seeds are slow to germinate, the stems 
are slow to develop, and it takes a year to complete the cycle of life. Now is 
the time to sow a new crop of leeks. And now is the time to dig the last of the 
leeks sowed a year ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Added to the rewards of virtue, leeks give us sweet eating. Carefully nurtured 
leeks, dug just before cooking, are guaranteed tender and luscious. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, these days young leeks are available the year around, brought in 
from various leek-producing climates, Mexico being a source right now. But not 
every produce buyer buys leeks young. Some markets offer overwintered or 
storage stalks, which can be tough and strongly flavored. Should the leeks you 
find have dry leaves or bulbs that are rounded at the tip, tell the produce 
manager they're unacceptable and take your business elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But if good leeks can be purchased, why go to the bother of growing them? With 
leeks, the answer will not be finer flavor -- because, frankly, all leeks are 
tasty. Availability and cost, though, will be a couple of reasons. Not every 
market offers leeks, and when it does, they can be pricey. 
</P>
<P>
 The real reason most of us grow leeks is the reason we grow cauliflower. For 
the love of it. For the challenge. For the mystery. Picking up leeks at the 
market, you can have no idea of the time they took, of the rhythms and 
ceremonies of their growing. 
</P>
<P>
 Leeks are members of the onion family that aren't meant to form bulbs -- 
that's why a bulbous bottom indicates a leek past its prime. As with onions, 
the translucent layers that form a leek's stem are leaves in embryo. To keep 
them white and to make them as long as they can possibly grow, blanch them and 
bury them in earth. The milky stems burrow into chocolate-brown soil while 
green leaves bask in sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
 Leeks love sunshine but not heat, so they must be started in cool weather. 
They can be harvested at any time (baby leeks are chic). Whether you need to 
beat summer's heat or are looking forward to a bunch of skinny beauties, order 
seeds ASAP -- or run down to the hardware store and pick up a packet of 
whatever it is they offer. Although there are nuances of flavor between 
cultivars, leeks aren't like tomatoes -- some flavorful, some blah. Any leek 
you grow will be thrilling. 
</P>
<P>
 (However, where summers are beastly and winters mild, you'd best sow leeks in 
early autumn when the weather cools. Mark your calendar.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Begun last year, my leeks are still less than an inch thick. They're Otinas, a 
French cultivar that has done best for me. Slenderness is in their genes. Had I 
planted the Giant Musselburg -- thick as a child's arm -- my leeks would be 
that size now. But having had it drummed into me that slender is tender and 
large is, well, vulgar, the idea of monster leeks appalls me. (Though I'd have 
to admit I've cooked one or two that size and they were succulent as can be.) 
</P>
<P>
 Leeks must have a sunny spot of luscious, well-drained soil. Their leaves are 
beautiful -- tall, flat banners of blue-green -- and would be pleasing in a 
garden border. But it's easiest to blanch leeks in a row in a trench. 
</P>
<P>
 Sow leeks indoors. When seedlings are the size of a pencil, dig a trench a 
foot deep and fill it with six inches of compost (or a reasonable facsimile 
from a sack at the nursery).  
</P>
<P>
 Set the seedlings in the trench six inches apart. Bury them up to their green 
leaves, adding soil as needed. Over the season, fill in the trench, then heap 
up earth around the leeks -- all you should ever see is leaves. Water gently so 
as not to dislodge the soil and keep the earth moist. And pull weeds, every 
last one of them.  
</P>
<P>
 Depending on which leeks you grow and when you take them, the stalks can be 
from six to 12 inches long. In the second spring, dig the leeks up before they 
start forming a flowering stalk -- that urge arrives with warm weather. (If 
you've ever found the center of a leek woody, the wood was a nascent flower 
stalk.) Harvest leeks with a long, strong, narrow tool that can wriggle down to 
where your leek is rooted. There's nothing more frustrating after you've 
nurtured it for months than having a leek snap in two. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Should you love the process as much I do, grow your next crop of leeks in a 
new place, to ward off soil-borne disease. 
</P>
<P>
 What to do with these aristocrats? Delicacy is what leeks are about. The way 
to get a sense of leeks -- past making traditional cock-a-leekie and 
vichyssoise soups -- is to try them in dishes in place of onions. But bear in 
mind: One of the beauties of onions is that they can be sent to the back of the 
chorus and their voices will still be heard. Leeks must be placed up front or 
their subtle song's lost. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, my mother, a fancier, adds raw sliced leeks and poppy seeds to 
her cornbread. A knockout. She softens coarsely chopped leeks in broth, then 
folds them into an omelet with sour cream and dill. And she lays her gorgeous 
steamed salmon on a bed of sauteed leeks. If my mother ate salad, she'd toss 
ribbons of leeks into a bowl with shreds of chicken, coins of watercress and 
purple violets.  
</P>
<P>
 For my part, I've created a salad of leeks to tempt her -- and to savor our 
little crop to the fullest. I added tastes of Greece and Italy for their warmth 
in this chilly season. Tonight the salad accompanied spaghetti and a 
nothing-but-tomatoes sauce topped with Reggiano-Parmigiano cheese. For guests, 
I'd add a lamb chop and a bowl of mandarin oranges for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare leeks for cooking, cut the stem from leaves at the point where 
leaves turn tough. Slice off the rootlet at one inch and save for planting. 
With market leeks, peel off leathery layers down to a tender one, if necessary. 
Slit stalks lengthwise from the top to the last inch above the bulb tip. Turn 
into a big pot of cold water. Swish gently to loosen hidden earth. Empty the 
water and repeat until no dirt is at the bottom of the pot. Unless you're 
cooking them with water, lay leeks on towels open sides down and pat dry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If leeks are to be surrounded with a sauce, they may be cut into the desired 
pieces before cooking. If leeks will be served with little dressing, they'll be 
more succulent if cooked whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Use every scrap of leeks. Turn trimmed leaves into your soup pot, cover with 
cold water and simmer. If they're from your leeks -- raised organically, one 
presumes -- you don't even need to rinse them. When the broth tastes leeky 
enough, strain it, pressing out all liquid, then pass the broth through a damp 
cloth to catch the grit. Season and use as you would chicken broth. Then give 
the leaves to the compost. 
</P>
<P>
 Past their lessons and their sweetness, leeks have more to offer. If you leave 
an inch of stem above the roots when you trim them off, you can plant the 
roots, setting tops just above the surface of the soil. In a couple of months 
you'll have fresh leeks -- the gift of new life.

 I have notions about the texture of a dish according to its place in the menu. 
Cooked thoroughly, leeks are soft -- in fact, mushiness can be a risk. I like 
soft leeks as a vegetable side dish. But I think of salad as having crispness. 
And so I cook the leeks for my salad just short of soft. And I think of salad 
as a lusty matter, so I slice the leeks into larger pieces than for a side 
dish. But cook and slice the leeks for your salad to please you. For color, 
serve on reddish leaves of lettuce, chicory, kale, cabbage or mustard. This 
makes a first course for a dinner party. For a larger, more casual salad, toss 
with crunchy lettuce. MEDITERRANEAN LEEK SALAD 1/3 cup olive oil 1/3 cup red 
wine vinegar 1/3 cup dry red wine 1 pound trimmed and washed tender leeks and 
leaves (start with about 1 1/2 pounds) Rounded 1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes 1/4 
cup dried black currants (dark raisins chopped currant size may be substituted) 
1/2 cup Kalamata olives, quartered lengthwise, pits removed 1/2 cup toasted 
pine nuts Salt Freshly ground pepper Balsamic vinegar or fresh lemon juice, 
optional Red-leafed lettuce or other edible leaves to line plates, or 1 head 
crisp lettuce, coarsely chopped, optional 1/2 cup chopped flat leaf parsley or 
cilantro  
</P>
<P>
 In heavy, non-reactive 11-inch skillet, blend olive oil, vinegar and wine. Fit 
in leeks in single layer. Add tomatoes, cover and bring to simmer over 
medium-high heat. Turn heat to medium, cover and simmer until leeks are tender 
with hint of crispness, depending on thickness and age, 7 to 14 minutes or 
until texture desired. Every 5 minutes, turn leeks with tongs, moistening in 
sauce. Remove from heat and sprinkle currants around edges of skillet. 
</P>
<P>
 When cool enough to handle, use kitchen scissors to cut up leeks and tomatoes 
in skillet. Snip leeks crosswise 1/2-inch wide, and cut tomatoes in 1/4-inch 
strips. Stir in olives and pine nuts. Season to taste with salt, pepper and 
balsamic vinegar. May be covered and refrigerated at this point.  
</P>
<P>
 Serve heaped on 6 leaf-lined salad plates sprinkled with parsley. Or toss in 
salad bowl with parsley, crisp lettuce and more vinegar to taste. Makes 6 
servings on individual salad plates, or 8 to 10 servings from salad bowl.

 Memory is a funny thing, absorbing some things and casting off others, 
seemingly without rhyme or reason. Lately I have been remembering spinach. More 
specifically, I've been trying to remember a method for cooking spinach that I 
read about years ago. I can't exactly say where it's from, but what I vividly 
recall is that it takes five days and incorporates almost a pound of butter. 
</P>
<P>
 Why can I remember that and not my phone number? My guess is that it has 
something to do with the way I feel about spinach. 
</P>
<P>
 Because spinach has been reviled by small minds for years, I will waste 
neither time nor space rising to its defense. If you don't like spinach, I say 
the heck with you. (Of course, I'm talking here about fresh spinach, not the 
noxious canned stuff that looks more like something you'd find at the bottom of 
a pond.) 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to ignore the drawbacks to fresh spinach. For one thing, it takes 
careful cleaning. Apparently the only thing spinach absorbs more readily than 
butter is sand. And since it thrives in sandy, moist soil, it can take several 
washings to get rid of the grit. The best way I've found is to fill a sink with 
cold water and unbind the leaves directly into it. Swirl the spinach, then let 
stand. Pull the spinach to a colander and let the water out, rinsing the bottom 
of the sink. Repeat two or three times, until you no longer see sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Once it is dirt-free, spinach has to be stemmed. When people complain of 
having spinach between their teeth, that green social blot is almost certainly 
the fibrous stem, as the leaf itself melts away to next to nothing. There are 
two ways to eliminate this problem. The quick and lazy one is simply to take a 
knife and trim the stems at the bottoms of the leaves. This is less than 
sure-fire, because in large leaves the stems can be coarse clear up the back of 
the leaf. To be sure you get everything, fold the leaf double along the stem, 
with the ridged side of the leaf pointing out. Grasp the stem and pull up. It 
will bring all the tough parts with it. Of course, doing this for four or five 
bound bunches of spinach is pretty tough too. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's effort well spent. With its verdant greenness, spinach is one of 
those foods that is nearly perfect in and of itself. It's richly flavored and 
restorative. There are nights in the winter when I think about cooking up a 
couple of pounds of spinach and then eating it by myself, hunched over the bowl 
like some cranky old miser.  
</P>
<P>
 I never do, of course; I'm a good sharer. And my family would never let me get 
away with it. They love spinach too. So I make twice the normal amount for 
three people and we fight over the last scraps. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spinach has a deep, green flavor with a metallic edge almost like the taste of 
a coin. Some feel that edge needs to be softened and they add cream or cheese 
(or even, in the celebrated case of French chef Michel Guerard, pureed pears!). 
But I like spinach best when it stands alone. A bit of garlic, perhaps . . . a 
grating of nutmeg, in some cases . . . butter (or olive oil), almost certainly. 
Anything more is risking over-complication. 
</P>
<P>
 There are exceptions, of course -- I love the way spinach melts into ricotta 
cheese as a filling for stuffed pastas, and one of the best dishes I've ever 
eaten was a simple plate of briefly cooked fresh spinach and lentils doused 
with neon-green recently pressed Umbrian olive oil. But those are exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Though spinach should be cooked simply, this is not strictly simple cooking. 
For one thing, never, ever cover it -- either during or even after cooking. 
Spinach contains oxalic acid, which is heat-sensitive. When you put a cover on 
hot spinach, the acid collects in the condensation on the underside of the lid, 
then rains back down on the spinach, turning it a particularly drab shade of 
olive. Salt will do the same thing, if applied too early. It breaks down the 
leaf's cell walls, spreading the acid. 
</P>
<P>
 More practically, you need to be sure you start spinach in a big enough pan. 
Spinach disappears more quickly than a memory. As the water cooks out of the 
vegetable, the leaves soften and crumple and end up nothing more than a lovely 
green near-puree. Just out of curiosity, the other day I measured spinach 
before and after cooking. Twenty cups of raw -- enough to nearly overflow a 
normal-sized wok -- concentrated to just less than two cups of cooked. 
</P>
<P>
 It's at this point that you want to start adding the butter. Do it a bit at a 
time, over low heat. It'll take a little while, but start with a couple of 
tablespoons and cook slowly. Within 10 minutes, or so, the butter will have 
disappeared. Add another couple of tablespoons and keep going. 
</P>
<P>
 Once I tried to go the full five days and pound of butter, but if memory 
serves, all the spinach vanished after only two. MISER'S SPINACH 3 pounds 
spinach (about 3 bunches) 4 cloves garlic, minced 1/4 cup butter, cut in pieces 
Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Rinse loose spinach in sink full of cold water, draining water and repeating 
as often as necessary. Remove spinach, shake dry and remove leaves from stems, 
either by tearing or cutting. (It is not necessary for leaves to be completely 
dry.) 
</P>
<P>
 Heat wok or large skillet. Add spinach, with any water still clinging, and 
garlic. Wok will be very full of spinach, but spinach will cook down in about 5 
minutes. Keep stirring and turning spinach to avoid burning and sticking. Add 2 
tablespoons butter and continue cooking, stirring, about 10 minutes. Spinach 
will absorb butter. Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter and continue cooking 
slowly until all butter is absorbed. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 180 calories; 461 mg sodium; 31 mg cholesterol; 
13 grams fat; 13 grams carbohydrates; 10 grams protein; 3.08 grams fiber.

PERSPECTIVE ON FOREIGN POLICY; HURLEYISM SWAMPS FOGGY BOTTOM; THEORISTS WITH NO 
PRACTICAL EXPERTISE ABOUT THE AREAS THEY TARGET COULD AGAIN POISON THE WELL FOR 
DECADES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHALMERS JOHNSON, Chalmers Johnson is a professor emeritus and a China and 
Japan specialist at UC San Diego. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first year of foreign policy under Bill Clinton displays all the marks of 
a typically American self-inflicted wound. This wound is caused by the reliance 
on "generalists," usually lawyers and professors, to carry out difficult new 
initiatives. Such people are trained in what they like to call "cutting-edge 
skills" but are totally innocent of the histories, cultures or languages of the 
countries where they so readily apply their theories. At best, they are engaged 
in expensive on-the-job training, which, if successful, will make them useful 
just as they are leaving office. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not just that most American political appointees are catastrophically 
misinformed about the countries they are dealing with. They are also 
ideologically blinded to the kinds of knowledge they would need to be 
effective. They believe that theory is all that matters, much as their 
Marxist-Leninist counterparts argued in Brezhnev's Russia and Mao's China. 
</P>
<P>
 Current examples of the results of theorists prevailing over people with 
practical expertise include the collapse of economic reform in Russia and the 
United States' inability to do anything about its $50-billion trade deficit 
with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 In Russia, economics professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard applied an 
ideologically rigid program of economic reform, based on some English-language 
textbooks intended to justify Anglo-American-type capitalism, without any 
attention to the country in which these reforms were being applied or even an 
ability to read Russian reports about how things were going. The results were 
predictable -- the movement toward democracy has been undercut, Boris Yeltsin 
is being discredited, Vladimir Zhirinovsky is advancing on an ultranationalist 
platform and many Russians are nostalgic for Lenin. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Sachs and his band of free-market shock-therapists read Alexander Yanov's 
"The Russian New Right," published in the late 1970s, they might have had a 
much better idea of how to shape their policies to make them effective. And 
they would have been forewarned that some measures of change in Russia, such as 
the strong reappearance of the Orthodox Church, do not mean the same thing that 
they might mean in Sachs' own society. 
</P>
<P>
 American policy toward Japan since last summer's collapse of the Liberal 
Democratic Party offers another example of ideological blindness. Lulled by the 
notion that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa was a "baby boomer" and a 
"consumer advocate," the United States, without a single high official who has 
substantial knowledge and experience of Japan and the ability to read the 
language, now faces yet another year of $50-billion-plus trade deficits with 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The intellectuals who have crafted recent American policy toward Japan include 
C. Fred Bergsten, a former Carter Administration official, whose idee fixe 
about the yen/dollar exchange rate has virtually destroyed the 
Japanese-American relationship, and Jagdish Bhagwati, a Columbia University 
economics professor whose Indian provenance has evidently given him a 
deep-seated distrust of economic planning. Bhagwati recently organized an 
economists' plea to Hosokawa to resist any efforts by the United States to 
consider results in making trade policy, even though a demand for results might 
force the Japanese government to end its policies of shielding Japanese 
manufacturers from international competition. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other recent examples of American myopia. For example, the NAFTA 
debate scrupulously tried to avoid any mention of Mexican economic conditions 
or social policies until guerrillas in Chiapas put them on the front pages. 
These and other cases suggest to me a return of the Patrick Hurley syndrome. 
Gen. Patrick J. Hurley is indelibly associated with what is surely one of the 
two or three greatest disasters in the history of American foreign policy -- 
the misanalysis of the Chinese revolution of the 1940s, leading to the collapse 
of U.S. foreign policy in the Pacific, the Korean and Vietnam wars, McCarthyism 
and American isolation from China for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurley was an Oklahoma politician, Herbert Hoover's secretary of war, an 
amateur diplomat and President Roosevelt's mediator between the Chinese 
Communists and the Chinese Nationalists in the civil war that followed the 
Japanese surrender. Hurley knew neither Chinese nor anything else about China. 
He bungled his mission because of overconfidence and because he totally misread 
the situation in terms of Chinese popular sentiments. But he dishonorably 
blamed his failure on the China specialists of the State Department, charging 
that they had predicted a communist victory (accurately, as it turned out) and 
were therefore pro-communist. Together with Sen. Joseph McCarthy, Hurley thus 
managed to poison American China policy for more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Our government again seems to be populated with Hurleys, this time from the 
legal profession, the professoriate and retreads from the Carter 
Administration. We have not learned what went wrong with Hurley. He was in over 
his head, and his credentials in domestic politics were not transferable to 
areas where there is no substitute for knowledge and experience. The return of 
Hurleyism to Washington suggests the likelihood of the recurrence of 
foreign-policy disasters comparable to the debacle of postwar China policy.

line of a computer company in Seattle, the clerk said, "Hey . . . you guys had

 Beckjord's Cube: Inspired that actor Jerry Van Dyke "survived the 6.6 quake 
due to having a four-posted bed that propped up his falling room," Jon Erik 
Beckjord has developed an earthquake-protection bed made out of pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more thick the pipe is, the more security," says Beckjord, who contacted 
The Times to share his specs. There are additional "bolt-down options and 
covering for the top of the cube, such as one-inch plywood. . . . And anyone 
can make one for under $200." 
</P>
<P>
 In the interests of journalistic disclosure, we should say that we attempted 
to induce Beckjord to go into business with us and market the invention. But he 
rejected several of our suggested accessories, such as wheels (so that a 
resident could move from room to room) and pontoons (in case there were some 
problems with the water heater).

 Old Unfaithful?We mentioned that a geyser in the northern California town of 
Calistoga began erupting at slower intervals last December -- just as it did 
before three other large earthquakes, including the 7.1 Loma Prieta (1989). 
</P>
<P>
 But Paul Silver, a geologist who believes California's Old Faithful may have a 
talent for predicting some shakers, isn't ready to say it was warning us about 
what was to befall Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen the the data yet," he said. "But there are a lot of other 
things that could affect the geyser. And it's really pretty far away (from 
Northridge). We've only been able to confirm cases of less than 150 miles 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, in that case, we'll stick with our detection method: earthquake weather.

 Naked assault: We've heard from several quake victims who were pelted Jan. 17

Clothes." Nice irony, we agree. But our question is: What's that revolutionary 
book doing in his house, anyway? miscelLAny:

THE CLINTONS' HEALTH CARE PLAN: LOOK AGAIN BEFORE WE LEAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is becoming obvious that the enormous edifice of ambitious reform 
represented by Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton's health care proposal needs to 
be tinkered with more than just around the edges. 
</P>
<P>
 That conclusion fills us with no great joy. U.S. health care may or may not be 
in "crisis" -- a much overused word -- but it certainly is in a great deal of 
difficulty. Far too many Americans can't afford care, and those who can are 
paying too much for less and less. 
</P>
<P>
 During his election campaign President Clinton promised action and the 
American people applauded; and during the first year of his presidency he, his 
top advisers and, most notably, the First Lady worked hard to propose a set of 
coherent reforms. Not surprisingly, the people support that effort. Across 
widely divergent groups there now is broad consensus that health care coverage 
needs to be made as universally available as possible and that the feverish 
rise in costs needs to be cooled. 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT IS THE REAL NEED?: When millions have no health insurance and thus cannot 
get proper routine and preventive care, all of us, whether through the specific 
risk of communicable disease or the general lowering of the public health, are 
affected. Tens of millions are shut off from everything other than emergency 
care. Worse yet -- and this is the Great American Health Care Paradox -- the 
nation continues to pay out, year after year, an ever-greater percentage of its 
national wealth to health care. 
</P>
<P>
 THE PRESIDENT'S RESPONSE: The President and the First Lady -- activist 
Democrats with a moderate, healthy tendency to want government involved -- have 
presented an extraordinarily detailed and ambitious blueprint for national 
health care reform. Perhaps not since Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal -- 
certainly at least not since Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society -- has there 
been such a comprehensive effort at redoing social policy. 
</P>
<P>
 One shortsighted contention -- largely from overly partisan Republicans -- is 
that the national health care problem has been overstated and therefore the 
proposed remedy is overwrought. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem definitely has not been overstated. But, and it's a big but , the 
proposed remedy -- "The President's Health Care Security Plan" -- may be the 
wrong medicine. In the final analysis the Clintons may well be proven better 
diagnosticians than surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
 THE OVER-ENGINEERING: What is proposed is incredibly complex. It is a daunting 
pastiche of idealism, federal interventionism and public policy modeling that 
is awesome and even a little frightening. It raises concern over the kind of 
controls the Clintons would have government exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 The fear within the medical community is that individual medical decisions 
might be made in the abstract by bureaucrats. That fear needs to be fully 
addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Our sense is that the proposal's reach needs to be more modest, the phasing in 
of reforms more gradual, the articulation of and public education on the 
choices and trade-offs more completely aired. 
</P>
<P>
 While the American system is no doubt the costliest in the world, it is by no 
means the worst: On the contrary, many aspects of the existing system work very 
well. And those are surely worth noting -- not to mention saving. 
</P>
<P>
 California, for instance, has a nationally admired health insurance system for 
public employees, run by CalPERS, that controls costs and keeps quality high. 
If the Clintons' plan were to pass intact, the CalPERS health plan would be 
history, superseded by regional health alliances. These alliances -- purchasing 
and administrative Goliaths -- would cross state boundaries and presumably roll 
over everything in their way. Doesn't that make you just a tad uneasy? 
</P>
<P>
 A NECESSARY CORRECTION: The plan needs to be reconsidered, but not in the 
semi-secrecy that characterized its formative stage last year. Reconsideration 
needs to be on glass-house display, wholly public in the various congressional 
committees. And the process needs to answer such basic questions as: 
</P>
<P>
 -- If the plan is an effort to establish a new federal entitlement program, is 
that what America wants, given the fact that it is the many government 
entitlement programs that fuel government deficits? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is it possible that a more creative use of powerful federal tax laws, to 
encourage universality of coverage and reduction of health care inflation, 
might in the end prove to be a more effective engine of reform than building 
new bureaucracies? 
</P>
<P>
 -- How will the plan affect employment and business activity if, as 
envisioned, employers are required to contribute the lion's share of the 
insurance costs? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Would it not make more sense to start the reform with a minimum of coverage 
-- a bare-bones plan -- and then ever so gradually and very carefully phase in 
new layers of benefits? Universality of coverage, absolutely; 
cost-consciousness, yes; but a basic menu first. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Would it not make sense to have a system that retained not only good state 
health care programs (like Hawaii's, and like California's if state Insurance 
Commissioner John Garamendi's plan were adopted) but also good public employee 
programs like CalPERS? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Would it not make sense for the federal government to set health care 
reform standards for the states to meet, rather than to impose over the states 
regional entities and therefore a federal plan? 
</P>
<P>
 Health reform is essential, but the nation needs to look further before it 
leaps. Americans need to hear out the criticisms and alternatives. After all, 
it's their health that's at stake.

ALL ROWING TOGETHER; COASTAL PANEL RETREATS AFTER RESISTING CITIES' BEACH 
CURFEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Coastal Commission wisely has revised its suggestion that it would 
not support locally imposed beach curfews it had said might violate the state 
Coastal Act by denying public access.  
</P>
<P>
 The change was disclosed last week in a meeting at Huntington Beach.Peter 
Douglas, the commission's executive director, told representatives of six 
Orange County cities that the state would not challenge the curfews the cities 
imposed recently in an effort to curb late-night crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In its earlier position the commission, however well-intentioned, did not 
calculate the full depth of local feeling. Many cities complain, 
understandably, that they can no longer afford the extra police patrols that 
longer beach hours require.

 One of the most compelling arguments for the cities has come from an official 
who wears two hats, that of a mayor and a commission member. Linda 
Moulton-Patterson of Huntington Beach said: "I am unwilling to turn over our 
beaches to gangs and violence. The decision is best left to the communities 
that are affected." 
</P>
<P>
 The disagreement started as a battle for turf on the anti-crime front, a 
dispute nobody wanted. The commission should stick to overseeing development 
along California's coastline to protect public interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission now suggests, more sensibly, that it draft guidelines to help 
enact curfews in a way that will not violate the law. We're glad to see people 
working together instead of fighting each other.

BLAKE, KINGS GIVE IT AWAY AS OILERS STAGE RARE RALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though the Edmonton Oilers had not won a game this season when they 
trailed after two periods, an 0-20-5 record, King Coach Barry Melrose mentioned 
the things that could change the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenseman Rob Blake heard the words in the intermission between the second 
and third periods and made Melrose's words seem prophetic in the final minutes 
here on Wednesday night. Blake's errant pass up the middle was batted down by 
Edmonton center Craig MacTavish, who scored the game-winner with 5:58 
remaining, leading the Oilers to a 6-4 victory over the Kings before 14,238 at 
Northlands Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a crushing loss for the Kings (19-26-6), who have won once in eight 
games, going 1-5-2. The Oilers, pulling within eight points of the Kings in the 
Pacific Division, had not won since Jan. 9 against Chicago and ended a 
nine-game winless streak. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Kings had two injured players back in the lineup -- Luc Robitaille and 
Tony Granato, who both missed Monday's game in Vancouver. Wayne Gretzky, still 
bothered by a sore neck, had said he might sit out but ended up playing and 
scoring a goal. 
</P>
<P>
 But on this night, mistakes lost it for the Kings. And Blake was not the sole 
villain. 
</P>
<P>
 He had plenty of company as the Kings' defensemen turned in a shoddy 
collective effort. But he took complete responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a stupid play by me. What was I doing?" Blake said. "You never go up 
the middle with five minutes left in the game.  
</P>
<P>
 "This was such an important game. It was a stupid, stupid, stupid mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 MacTavish, alone in the high slot, knocked down Blake's pass and blasted a 
shot past King goaltender Kelly Hrudey, beating him on the glove side. Then 
MacTavish completed the scoring with an empty-netter at 19:54 after Hrudey had 
been pulled for an extra attacker. 
</P>
<P>
 Said MacTavish: "I kind of anticipated that he would throw it up the middle, 
to be honest. I think he was shielded. I got fortunate. He doesn't make that 
mistake very often." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Blake: "I don't know why I made the pass. As soon as I did it, I knew 
something would happen. I put the puck right on stick, you couldn't ask for 
much better. I'm not showing the right example. We've got to win some hockey 
games." 
</P>
<P>
 Said center Pat Conacher: "We made some mistakes and they capitalized. We were 
our own worst enemies. Sometimes simple plays are overlooked in the game. Put 
it (the puck) up the boards. Why take a chance? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's everybody. Everyone was making mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 It was especially difficult since the Kings had established leads of 2-0 and 
3-1. They took a 3-1 lead at 12:08 of the second period when Gretzky scored 
from the right crease off a pinpoint pass from Jari Kurri. With the goal, his 
25th of the season, Gretzky is 11 goals away from tying Gordie Howe's all-time 
record of 801. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Oilers tied it by scoring twice in the next 2:37. Kurri scored his 
21st of the season to give the Kings a 4-3 lead with 23 seconds remaining in 
the second. The goal was his 545th, moving him past Maurice Richard for sole 
possession of 10th place. 
</P>
<P>
 King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 New York Ranger General Manager Neil Smith said Wednesday he has been talking 
to the Kings about re-acquiring forward Tomas Sandstrom. Both sides said a deal 
is not imminent, but it has been discussed. The Kings have always thought 
highly of Ranger defenseman Jeff Beukeboom, who would provide a much-needed 
physical presence. One reason the Kings might be willing to move Sandstrom: He 
is playing out his option. Sandstrom, who is making $1.33 million this season, 
said he and his agent have not had any serious contract talks with the Kings 
this season.

MORNING BRIEFING: NOW ONLY THE TEAM IS SECOND CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The most upbeat thing to happen to the San Diego Padres in recent memory is 
the opening of their new training camp in Peoria, Ariz., a 145-acre site they 
will share this spring with the Seattle Mariners. The cozy, earth-toned stadium 
will accommodate 10,000 fans, with ticket prices ranging from $4 to $15. For 
$7, you can buy a seat in some shade with your own misting system to keep cool; 
for $15, concession waiters will serve you.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's just nice to have something that's first class," Padre President Dick 
Freeman told Kevin Kernan of the San Diego Union, who added that Freeman is 
well aware that first class and Padres are not usually used in the same 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who is the all-time leading money winner on the PGA Tour? 
</P>
<P>
 Mere peanuts: So what's an extra week worth for major league players in the 
playoffs? Next October, it's about $37,000 each. That's the average projected 
share from the players' pool for the new first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Writes Phil Rogers of the Dallas Morning News: "That may sound like a lot of 
money, but it's a pay cut for most players. The average player made about 
$43,000 a week during the 1993 season. Ryne Sandberg, baseball's highest-paid 
player last season, drew $245,354.37 a week for each of the 26 weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a minute: Since the Albertville Games in 1992, the International Olympic 
Committee has tried to tighten qualifications for participation in the Winter 
Olympics, specifically limiting the field, to, well, athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Hodler, an IOC member and president of the International Ski Federation, 
said that in the '92 men's Alpine events, a South American country entered an 
athlete who had never skied before. Hodler was hardly consoled when organizers 
were assured that the racer would spend a few days in ski school before the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Olympic crackdown: A European official recalled a case of a particularly 
inept bobsled team at Albertville: "The bob was at a standstill, and they asked 
one of the starting officials for a push -- a gentle one because they didn't 
want to go too fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Enough already: After the Buffalo Bills lost the Super Bowl on Sunday, Jim 
Wright dived into the icy Monongahela River in Fredericktown, Pa., to settle a 
bet with a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive year that Wright, 37, had bet on the Bills and 
ended up in the river, about 30 miles south of Pittsburgh. Last year, he came 
down with pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Buffalo makes it next year, I'm not going in," a dripping wet Wright said 
after scrambling out of the 36-degree water. "No more Buffalo. Two years in a 
row Buffalo let me down." 
</P>
<P>
 Brought up right: Scott Fowler of the Miami Herald, commenting on the good 
manners of Heat player Harold Miner: "After Miner accidentally collided with a 
table containing at least 100 cups of Gatorade during an October practice, he 
grabbed a towel and started feverishly wiping." 
</P>
<P>
 Add heat: Fowler also explored the ever-changing hairstyles of Matt Geiger: 
"In order, clean-cut frat boy; bald with Fu Manchu mustache; New Year's 
celebrator with '94 shaved in; back to bald, semi-normal growth, and the 
now-infamous Mohawk." 
</P>
<P>
 Explained Geiger: "I've never had great hair to begin with. So I decided I 
should just start doing some crazy things with it. It puts me in a good mood 
when I look in the mirror. I think I look sort of tough. And you only live 
once, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Tom Kite, with more than $8 million in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Miami Heat forward Willie Burton, after he ordered a pizza from the 
bench, while sidelined with an injury, and sat there eating it during a game: 
"What's the big deal? I was hungry, man. It's not like I committed a crime."

DUCKS TAKE TOLL ON FLAMES BUT FALL, 4-2; HOCKEY: TREFILOV, CALGARY'S STANDOUT 
ROOKIE GOALTENDER, SUFFERS INJURED KNEE AND IS TAKEN OFF THE ICE ON A 
STRETCHER. 
</P>

<P>
 Another Mighty Duck game, another injured opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Calgary Flames' standout rookie goaltender, Andrei Trefilov, became the 
latest casualty. He left Wednesday night's game on a stretcher because of an 
undetermined injury to his right knee late in the second period of the Ducks' 
4-2 loss in front of 17,174 at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks are suddenly bad news for the other guys, and not simply by hanging 
close in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
 Winnipeg's Teemu Selanne suffered a partially torn Achilles' tendon against 
the Ducks last week, and the Kings had several injuries in their victory over 
the Ducks on Saturday -- Gary Shuchuk suffered an injured knee, Luc Robitaille 
a minor ankle injury and Wayne Gretzky was cut on the gum, the nose or nowhere 
at all, depending on whom you talk to. 
</P>
<P>
 At least this time, Duck defenseman Don McSween had nothing to do with it. 
McSween accidentally cut Selanne with his skate blade, was in on a collision 
with Shuchuk, and was the unintentional perpetrator of the controversial 
high-sticking major against Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 Trefilov was hurt when he tried to make a sudden move in the crease, but 
didn't appear to be hit by a Duck. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a serious collision or anything, he just goes down in a funny 
manner," said Calgary Coach Dave King, who reported that Trefilov was taken to 
a hospital, and there was concern about ligament damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was tied, 2-2, entering the third, but the Ducks made a couple of 
errors and Calgary's Robert Reichel scored twice to claim the two points for 
his team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a chance to make up some ground tonight because of the Kings' loss, 
but we had a couple of mental breakdowns that cost us goals," right wing Terry 
Yake said. "They just waited for us to make the mistakes, so in a sense they 
beat us at our own game." 
</P>
<P>
 Reichel scored the go-ahead goal at 2:05 after picking off a pass by Duck 
defenseman Bill Houlder in the Ducks' zone and beating goalie Ron Tugnutt from 
high in the slot. 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt, making his first start since Jan. 16, didn't appear to make much of a 
move to stop the shot, but the puck took a bit of a bad bounce after being 
partially deflected by a defenseman's stick. 
</P>
<P>
 Reichel gave the Flames a cushion at 14:55 with his 22nd goal when Calgary got 
out on a three-on-one rush. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously it was a disappointing loss," Duck Coach Ron Wilson said. "It was a 
strange goal on the third one. Then they just went into a defensive shell. Once 
they got that one-goal lead, they pretty much shut us down." 
</P>
<P>
 Trefilov, 24, had back-to-back shutouts earlier this season and entered the 
game with a 2.47 goals-against average. With All-Star Mike Vernon just on the 
verge of recovering from a twisted knee, he has been crucial to the Flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Trefilov went down in the crease as Tim Sweeney swung his stick in an attempt 
to swat in a rebound, but replays showed no contact. 
</P>
<P>
 With medical personnel deliberately moving Trefilov to a stretcher and only 
5.5 seconds remaining in the period, referee Ron Hoggarth sent the teams into 
the dressing rooms early. 
</P>
<P>
 Trevor Kidd took over, but wasn't really tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Nieuwendyk gave Calgary a 1-0 lead at 10:55 of the first, but the Ducks 
evened the score at 2:15 of the second on Joe Sacco's 65-foot slap shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks led, 2-1, after Yake scored his 16th goal of the season at 14:48 of 
the second, but Calgary's Gary Roberts tied the score 59 seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Anatoli Semenov, who played two games after returning from a seven-week layoff 
because of a dislocated left elbow, missed a second consecutive game because of 
soreness in the elbow. Defenseman Alexei Kasatonov (bruised right foot) was 
scratched for a second consecutive game.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm rooting for the Coliseum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I hope the earthquake victim will be well by football season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Too many people have told me that what happened was a blessing in disguise, 
that the gray old lady will be torn down and replaced by a gleaming new 
state-of-the-art stadium. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Sure it will. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If the Coliseum is leveled, how are we going to get the money to rebuild? 
Shucks, we couldn't even fund a promised makeover. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 We'll be lucky to get the $35-million-or-more needed for repairs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If the Coliseum isn't ready for next season, USC might play in Anaheim and the 
Raiders in Oakland or even farther away. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Coliseum has been my Fenway Park, my Tiger Stadium, my Wrigley Field. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 I grew up watching the Rams, taking the Pico Boulevard and Vermont Avenue 
trolley cars to the Coliseum and sitting in the "Free Football for Kids" 
section. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think I got in for nothing that day, but I remember when the Rams won 
their first and only NFL championship, beating the Cleveland Browns of Otto 
Graham and Lou (the Toe) Groza, 24-17, in 1951. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Waterfield, Elroy (Crazy Legs) Hirsch, Tom Fears, Tank Younger, Deacon Dan 
Towler and Don Paul were my first sports idols. The Rams were the only major 
league franchise around. No Raiders, Dodgers, Angels, Lakers, Clippers, Kings 
or Mighty Ducks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The 1958 Rams -- featuring the most acrobatic running back and kick returner 
of his era, Jaguar Jon Arnett -- finished second in the Western Conference, but 
set an NFL home attendance average record of 83,680 that still stands. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A year earlier, they drew a record 102,368 for a game against the San 
Francisco 49ers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I have seen five Heisman Trophy winners perform for the home team at the 
Coliseum -- Mike Garrett, O.J. Simpson, Charles White and Marcus Allen of USC 
and Gary Beban of UCLA. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A confident young Navy quarterback named Roger Staubach nearly pulled off an 
upset of unbeaten USC in 1962, and a strong, swift halfback from Syracuse named 
Ernie Davis ran through UCLA in 1959. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The great USC-UCLA and USC-Notre Dame games are too numerous to mention. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Coliseum is the only stadium ever to play host to the Super Bowl, Olympic 
Games and World Series. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, I'm just hoping that this L.A. treasure will play host to another 
football game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Miller still can't get any respect. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 When he was a scoring machine at UCLA, the skeptics said he wouldn't make it 
big in the NBA because of his temperament.Now that the Indiana Pacer is leading 
Eastern Conference guards in scoring, he's being left off the All-Star team. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver Miller has become the best passing center in the NBA. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If the Clippers ever get the opportunity to trade Danny Manning to the Phoenix 
Suns for Miller and Cedric Ceballos, they should jump at it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 No Laker made the All-Star team for the second consecutive year. They had been 
represented in 31 of the previous 32 games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to an item here last week about an "Oscar Night" canvas being 
painted for display at the Grand Olympic Auditorium, Bruce Davis, director of 
the Academy of Motion Picture, Arts and Sciences, told promoter Bob Arum that 
his organization held the rights to the name. As a compromise, the canvas will 
read "Oscar's Night." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Lionel Butler, who fights Jerry Jones Tuesday at the Country Club in Reseda, 
has been elevated to No. 3 in the World Boxing Council heavyweight rankings. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Butler, managed by former rock star Lee Michaels, had a 6-10 record when he 
came here two years ago to be promoted by Ten Goose and trained by Joe Goossen. 
Since then, he's 15-0 with 15 knockouts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Frankie Randall's 12-round upset of Julio Cesar Chavez will be replayed Friday 
at 9:50 p.m. and Saturday at 2:20 p.m. on Showtime. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State, which won the Big West pennant and reached the College World 
Series last season, will play the 49ers' pro alumni Saturday at 1 p.m. at Blair 
Field. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Bailey, who rode 133-1 longshot Arcangues to victory in the Breeders' 
Cup Classic last November, will return to Santa Anita to ride Kissin Kris in 
the $500,000 Strub Stakes Sunday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Free-agency season in the NFL opens Feb. 18. It will be especially important 
this year because of the salary cap. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Among running backs who might interest the Raiders is Lorenzo White. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Hank Aaron's 60th birthday is Saturday. Babe Ruth's 99th birthday is Sunday.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; NOTRE DAME FACES MORE TARNISH

 The 1991 "resignation" of Notre Dame's Digger Phelps always had the distinct 
smell of fish to it. Nothing against Phelps' social conscience, but since when 
does someone walk away from a life's work so he later can help observe 
Cambodian elections? 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps, who coached the Irish for 20 years, put on a happy face the day he 
announced his departure from Notre Dame, but it was obvious there was more to 
the story. How else do you explain the noticeable absence of any of the 
school's power brokers--Rev. E. William Beauchamp, executive vice president; 
Rev. Edward A. Malloy, president; Richard Rosenthal, athletic director--at the 
farewell news conference? Didn't 17 winning seasons, 14 NCAA tournament 
appearances, a trip to the Final Four and a perfect graduation rate deserve 
better than the generic "We-wish-Digger-well" statement Rosenthal later issued 
to the media? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, well, now comes Notre Dame's worst nightmare: another tell-all book on 
the inner workings of the school's hierarchy, this one by Teresa Godwin Phelps. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, Mrs. Digger. 
</P>
<P>
 First there was "Under the Tarnished Dome," a best-selling expose on Coach Lou 
Holtz and the Irish football program. Now this, "The Coach's Wife," sort of a 
stand-by-your-man look at the hypocrisy of college athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Phelps, a Notre Dame graduate who teaches at the university's law 
school, does what her husband wouldn't or couldn't do the day he announced his 
resignation: She fills in the blanks. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Terry Phelps, Rosenthal told Digger as early as March of 1990 
that the school wanted a new coach. Rosenthal then said the only reason Phelps 
wouldn't be fired immediately was so he could complete his 20th season at Notre 
Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Flabbergasted by the conversation, Digger told Rosenthal he wanted to coach 
the Irish five more years. Rosenthal told him fat chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Still thinking he could save his job, Phelps took his case to Malloy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Father Malloy said that even if I won the national title next year, I was 
still finished coaching here," Digger later told his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons? Malloy, Beauchamp and Rosenthal didn't like Phelps' style of 
play, were worried about the lack of top-20 rankings and decreasing ticket 
sales. Or as Terry Phelps wrote: "They measured success by the bottom 
line--money." DIGGER AND THE DOME--PART II 
</P>
<P>
 As one might expect, Rosenthal and Beauchamp don't fare well in the book. 
Among the revelations: 
</P>
<P>
 --Rosenthal was "irate" when Digger agreed to play Louisiana State in a 
nationally televised game in New Orleans, with a portion of the proceeds 
earmarked for a homeless center in South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 --Rosenthal wrested the scheduling duties from Phelps, the result being a 
ridiculously hard lineup of opponents that has contributed to the program's 
downfall, to say nothing of compromising the players' abilities to function as 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 --Rosenthal, as well as Malloy and Beauchamp, ignored Phelps' request that the 
basketball program shed its independent status and join a conference. 
</P>
<P>
 --Beauchamp sent a letter to Phelps in November of 1990. In it, Beauchamp said 
Phelps could return for the 1991-92 season if he accepted a $20,000 pay cut, 
allowed Rosenthal to have the final say on recruiting and announced his 
decision to resign at season's end. In a later letter, the offer was withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than fight the administration, as he had initially vowed to do, Phelps 
ultimately decided to retire. Said Phelps to his wife: "Look at what the 
response has been to questions about my future--'We review every coach every 
year.' After 20 years of opening my veins for Notre Dame, I'm to be 'reviewed.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps, now with ESPN, wasn't without his coaching faults. Of course, the same 
can be said of Phelps' replacement, John MacLeod, who has seen his victory 
totals go from 18 to nine to six and counting. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to the Notre Dame administration's newest fear: Does Carol 
MacLeod, the coach's wife, have a literary agent? THAT'S NOT THE WAY HE 
REMEMBERS IT 
</P>
<P>
 John Pelphrey, a first-year assistant coach at Oklahoma State, was watching 
videotape of a recent game when a commercial featuring a fat guy wearing a Duke 
jersey suddenly appeared on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Pelphrey didn't pay much attention to it until he noticed it was Chris Farley 
of "Saturday Night Live" fame, and that Farley was re-creating Christian 
Laettner's game-winning shot against Kentucky in the 1992 NCAA East Regional 
final. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was watching almost in disbelief," Pelphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the clever spot, Farley elbows his way past the five life-size cardboard 
cutouts of Kentucky players, lumbers toward the basket and then launches shot 
after shot until, finally, the ball drops through the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's the way it happened!" Farley shouts, followed later by, "Well, 
almost." 
</P>
<P>
 Pelphrey laughed when he saw it. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 Look quickly and you'll see Pelphrey's cardboard likeness knocked to the 
ground by Farley. That's because the former Wildcat forward was assigned to 
help cover Laettner on the final shot that night in Philadelphia. He did what 
he could, but Laettner made the magical jumper anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke went on to win a national championship. Pelphrey, his playing career 
ended by the shot, simply went home. 
</P>
<P>
 "All that pain and hurt is gone now," Pelphrey said. "It only took a year and 
a half." 
</P>
<P>
 Pelphrey never has watched a replay of the Kentucky loss, considered by some 
to be the most exciting NCAA tournament game of all time. However, he has seen 
the Farley spoof. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's a funny dude," Pelphrey said. "I thought it was really cute. But 
I've been wondering if I could get a piece of that money." 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, no residuals. THE TV GODS 
</P>
<P>
 In easy-to-understand language, the essence of coaching success, courtesy of 
Temple's John Chaney: 
</P>
<P>
 "You got to get players. I think the thing that gives you players, the thing 
that opens the doors in the homes of young people, (is) the fact that you're 
able to talk to them about something they're familiar with. They're familiar 
with having seen you on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "(North Carolina Coach) Dean Smith does not leave his door--and I know he 
doesn't leave his door. He's got assistant coaches out there working their 
tails off and the only thing he's got to do is get on a phone and say, 'Did you 
get the letter of intent?' That's all he's got to ask. He just mentions his 
name, 'This is Dean Smith.' That's all he's got to say to the average kid. 
Because he's a household word in this business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time a guy can come in at the 11th hour-- the 11th hour --and who was not 
even in the picture and recruit the top recruit in the country (7-foot center 
Rasheed Wallace of Philadelphia). . . . That does not happen because somebody 
is looking at the radio." 
</P>
<P>
 Temple, which plays football in the Big East Conference and basketball in the 
Atlantic 10, wants to become a full-time member of the Big East. Wherever the 
Owls wind up, Chaney said there had better be lots of television lights. Or 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've certainly got to look at that TV, because that seems to be what's 
wagging everybody around," he said. COUNTDOWN IN CAROLINA 
</P>
<P>
 Ten things you should know about tonight's game between No. 1-ranked Duke and 
No. 2 North Carolina at Chapel Hill: 
</P>
<P>
 (1) Even with North Carolina guard Donald Williams, the Final Four MVP, 
considered a longshot to play because of injury, the Tar Heels are favored. 
Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said it was the first time he could remember a 
top-ranked team relegated to underdog status. 
</P>
<P>
 (2) Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Cremins picks the Tar Heels to win: home-court 
advantage. Clemson's Cliff Ellis and Florida State's Pat Kennedy said Duke had 
a chance, but they didn't say it with much conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 (3) This is the 191st meeting of the teams, but only the first time they have 
entered the game ranked Nos. 1 and 2. 
</P>
<P>
 (4) In 12 of the last 32 games between the Blue Devils and Tar Heels, one of 
them has been ranked No. 1. That team has won nine of those 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
 (5) It is 11.1 miles from the doorstep of Cameron Indoor Stadium to the Dean 
E. Smith Center. We just thought you'd like to know. 
</P>
<P>
 (6) Krzyzewski says North Carolina is "more talented than we are." And: "It's 
astonishing how much talent they have coming off the bench." He's right. 
</P>
<P>
 (7) Duke or North Carolina has won the last three national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 (8) Clemson's Ellis says the game will have higher TV ratings than the Final 
Four. Doubtful--it's on ESPN2. 
</P>
<P>
 (9) The most telling matchup of the evening will feature much-improved Duke 
center Cherokee Parks vs. All-American Eric Montross, once dubbed, "Useless 
White Space," by the Blue Devil student newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 (10) Williams will play briefly, but it won't matter. Krzyzewski will figure 
out a way to semi-neutralize the Tar Heels' inside attack. That done, North 
Carolina's most glaring weakness will be exposed: no outside shooting. Duke 
wins. THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 Who has the best conference? "I think we've probably got the best athletes 
overall of any league," Arkansas' Nolan Richardson said of the Southeastern 
Conference. Countered Clemson's Ellis: "Without a doubt, this is the league." 
The weekly RPI rankings, which measure strength of conference, had the Big Ten 
No. 1, followed by the ACC and the Big Eight. The SEC was ninth. . . . If the 
season ended today, comeback-player-of-the-year honors would go to Texas point 
guard B.J. Tyler, who missed all but 13 games last season because of injuries 
and later entered the John Lucas Center in an effort to combat depression. The 
Longhorns have won 11 of their last 13 games, due in part to Tyler, who leads 
the Southwest Conference in scoring. With Tyler back in the lineup, Texas is 
averaging nearly 20 points more a game. Top 10

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Indiana trailed by as many as 11 points and lost Coach Bob Knight to an 
ejection, but the No. 14 Hoosiers still defeated Ohio State, 87-83, in overtime 
Wednesday night at Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight was ejected after receiving two technical fouls 69 seconds apart in the 
second half. Both technicals came for arguing with officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Without him, the Hoosiers overcame a second-half deficit and moved into a tie 
for first place in the Big Ten with Michigan. Indiana (13-4, 6-2) extended the 
nation's longest home winning streak to 40 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Pat Graham, who finished with 29 points, and Damon Bailey, who had 19,

McDyess' layup with 15:28 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Riddick's basket 25 seconds later got Kentucky going again and, after an 
Alabama turnover, Rhodes drove in for a dunk for a 51-44 advantage. 
</P>

seven of Saint Louis' school-record 14 three-point baskets, to lead the 
Billikens to a Great Midwest victory at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Saint Louis (17-1, 4-1) matched its victory total for the previous two 
seasons. The Billikens have made 154 three-pointers this season, including 13 
on two occasions. 
</P>

NBA ROUNDUP; WILKENS GAINS HIS 900TH WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a sellout crowd waving cards congratulating him on his 900th NBA victory, 
Lenny Wilkens did something he rarely does during a game -- smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reaching 900 wins is certainly an achievement, but my thoughts are always on 
the game," Wilkens said Wednesday night after his Atlanta Hawks defeated the 
Orlando Magic, 118-99, at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkens, at 900-760, trails only Red Auerbach's 938 in regular-season 
victories. Dominique Wilkins scored 26 points to lead the Hawks. Shaquille 
O'Neal scored 22 points for Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 85, Washington 80 -- Patrick Ewing scored 29 points, including the 
go-ahead basket with 1:06 remaining, as the Knicks stretched their winning 
streak to six games by defeating the Bullets at Landover, Md. Tom Gugliotta led 
Washington with 18 points. Charles Oakley had 18 points and 12 rebounds for New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 104, Milwaukee 90 -- Rookies Allan Houston and Lindsey Hunter combined 
for 36 second-half points at Auburn Hills, Mich., to help the Pistons end a 
six-game losing streak. Houston, who had with a career-high 28 points, and 
Hunter, who finished with 19, gained extra playing time because the Pistons 
played the second half without Isiah Thomas, who suffered a bruised calf, and 
Sean Elliott, who was ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 105, Philadelphia 97 -- Gerald Wilkins scored 20 points and Brad 
Daugherty added 18 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Cavaliers at 
Philadelphia. Rookie Shawn Bradley did not play after being suspended for one 
game without pay and fined $3,000 for pushing an official. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 92, Minnesota 88 -- Jamal Mashburn scored 26 points and Jim Jackson had 
19 as the Mavericks improved to 3-0 over the Timberwolves at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 124, Charlotte 112 -- The Pacers took an 80-50 halftime lead, tying a 
Hornet record for points given up in the first half. Indiana's Reggie Miller 
scored 25 points, including 12 in the first quarter at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 97, Boston 84 -- Detlef Schrempf had 21 points, and the Celtics made 
26 turnovers in the SuperSonics' victory at Boston.

 Owners of the New Jersey Nets have rejected a nine-year, $90-million contract 
proposal for Derrick Coleman that would have made the All-Star forward the 
highest paid player in sports, the New York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
 The veto of the deal came after Willis Reed, the club's vice president and 
general manager, had reached an agreement with Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed has been instructed by the owners to explore a trade for Coleman, 
according to the paper. Coleman's current contract would make him a free agent 
after next season.

NEWSWIRE: REPORTERS ACCUSE MARADONA OF FIRING AN AIR GUN AT THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Argentine police searched Diego Maradona's home and fingerprinted him 
Wednesday but did not find an air gun that journalists said the soccer star had 
fired at them, according to his attorney, Hugo Jofre. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being seen on television crouched behind an automobile aiming a rifle 
at the camera, Maradona was only fingerprinted after the police raid failed to 
discover a rifle.

 Maradona, fed up with journalists surrounding his home near Buenos Aires 
estate, lost his temper a day after his club, Newell's Old Boys, fired him 
after four months for repeatedly missing practice.

<P>
 At least five reporters were injured when they were hit by pellets from an air

on the scene said they saw him carrying a gun. One photographer said he took a 
photo of Maradona firing. Jurisprudence

ORANGE LEAGUE BOYS' BASKETBALL; STEADY MAGNOLIA POUNDS SAVANNA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Savanna came out against Magnolia looking as though it might set a record for 
three-point shooting. The Rebels made five three-pointers in the first quarter 
on their way to a six-point lead in the battle for first place in the Orange 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 But by game's end, they appeared to be going for another record -- most 
turnovers in a half. The visiting Rebels scored only 13 points in the second 
half and were soundly beaten by an opportunistic Magnolia team, 61-46, 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Savanna (11-10, 5-2), tied with Magnolia at 39 going into the fourth quarter, 
scored the first points of the fourth quarter on a Dan Avila jumper. From 
there, the Rebels turned the ball over six consecutive times and went nearly 
six minutes before scoring again. By the time Paul Waldrop made one of two free 
throws with 2 minutes 13 seconds left, Magnolia (16-6, 6-1) had a 52-42 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Magnolia decided to play defense tonight," Savanna Coach C.D. Snider said. 
"We usually don't turn it over much, but it happened (Wednesday). They're a lot 
bigger than we are and they have long arms, which makes it tough to throw over 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia center Brandon Hearvey said the defensive intensity came from his 
coach Al Wallin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put on the defense pretty hard," Hearvey said. "We got yelled at pretty 
bad at halftime. He told us to stop the three-pointers and to get in their 
face." 
</P>
<P>
 Savanna guard Malcolm Dougan scored 11 points on three three-pointers in the 
first quarter, but he attempted only one more three-pointer after that and he 
didn't score again. Savanna finished with six three-pointers as Jermaine 
Moore's second-quarter three was the Rebels' last one of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Hearvey (18 points, eight rebounds) and Todd Callahan (six points, 
10 rebounds) went to work inside and Shawn Scott (11 points, three 
three-pointers) and Frank Henderson (17 points) provided the outside punch.

SUNSET LEAGUE BOYS' BASKETBALL; BATTERED ARVESEN GIVES BARONS A VICTORY OVER 
HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Arvesen, bloodied once again, provided and symbolized Fountain Valley's 
57-56 Sunset League victory over Huntington Beach Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the Barons were beaten, bruised and a little worse for the wear, but 
they were still standing. 
</P>
<P>
 Arvesen, who had been elbowed in the mouth, made a three-point basket with 1 
minute 5 seconds left to give the Barons a one-point lead. They then survived 
several moments of potential disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers took three shots at victory. Tony Gonzalez missed an eight-footer 
with 14 seconds left. Matt Malmquist missed the front end of a one-and-one with 
two seconds left. Gonzalez then got the rebound and put up a shot that hit the 
rim at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those final seconds were an eternity," Baron Coach Gordon Billingsley said. 
</P>
<P>
 But worth the wait. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory put the Barons (17-5, 9-2) in sole possession of first place and 
has them tantalizingly close to their first championship in nine seasons. 
Fountain Valley won seven league titles in 12 seasons from 1974-85 but has not 
finished higher than third since. 
</P>
<P>
 With three games remaining, their future is in their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just numb all over," Arvesen said. "My tooth is numb, my mouth is numb, 
my body is numb." 
</P>
<P>
 He also left the Oilers numb. 
</P>
<P>
 Arvesen, who scored eight points, appeared to have been TKOd midway through 
the fourth quarter. He caught an elbow in the mouth, which pushed in his front 
tooth. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly a surprise. After all, Arvesen received a gash on his chin in a game 
three weeks ago. That cut required six stitches; he didn't miss a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, he returned with 1:22 left, set up at the top of the key, and sank 
a three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was confident and my tooth didn't hurt at all," Arvesen said, "so I shot." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the last lead change in a game of ebbs and flows. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach (14-9, 8-3) led by as many as 14 points in the first quarter 
and controlled the inside. The Oilers scored eight points after offensive 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Barons toughened up and countered. They went on a 19-0 run that gave 
them a 27-22 lead with less than four minutes left in the half. Daniel Keller, 
who scored 20 points, had nine during the run. The Oilers didn't score their 
first basket in the quarter for five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons also controlled Gonzalez, who is the second-leading scorer in the 
county. He finished with 18 points, getting only three in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Edison 73, Marina 59 -- Micah Kroeger had 26 points for visiting Edison (13-7, 
6-5). Andy Nieto had 25 for Marina (9-14, 3-8). 
</P>
<P>
 Servite 54, Ocean View 45 -- Kristian Vallas scored 19 points for Servite 
(15-7, 8-3). Kevin Johnson had 18 for Ocean View (12-11, 7-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana 72, Westminster 46 -- Raul Martinez scored 15 points for host Santa 
Ana (3-15, 2-9).

<P>
 Mister Jolie rallied from next to last to win the $46,000 feature by two 
lengths over Cimply A Winner at Santa Anita Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye, Mister Jolie went five wide into the home 
stretch and drew clear. The 4-year-old Florida-bred gelding covered six 
furlongs in 1:09. He paid $4.20, $3 and $2.40 as the 11-10 favorite in the 
field of seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince Wild, the 3-1 second choice, was four lengths back in third. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory, worth $25,300, increased Mister Jolie's career earnings to 
$91,925, with four victories in nine starts.

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: DRAGSTERS OPEN WITH ANXIETY, ANTICIPATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rarely in recent drag racing history has a National Hot Rod Assn. season 
opened with as much anxiety and anticipation as this year's series, which gets 
under way today at the Pomona Raceway with the first qualifying rounds of the 
34th annual Chief Auto Parts Winternationals. 
</P>
<P>
 A purse of $1,290,200 has attracted most of the country's top drag racers for 
the four-day festival of speed on a corner of the Los Angeles County 
Fairgrounds. Final eliminations are scheduled for Sunday, after qualifying runs 
today, Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Winternationals will have a different look from any previous season 
opener, as well as from last year's season closer at Pomona, the Winston 
Finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Changes begin at the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Loquacious John Force, the Yorba Linda driver who won Winston Racing Series 
funny car championships in two of the last three years while driving an 
Oldsmobile, has switched to a Chevrolet Lumina. Despite winning a record 11 
races last year to regain the championship he lost in 1992 to Cruz Pedregon, 
Force and his mechanical brain trust of Austin Coil, Bernie Fedderly and Larry 
Frazier chose to try different-looking sheet-metal on his Castrol funny car 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping we can run away with it, but the competition is going to be 
tougher," Force said. "It's going to be a lot different than last year, 
especially with K.C. (Spurlock) coming back with (crew chief) Ronnie 
Swearingen. I'm looking for that to be the hot rod to beat." 
</P>
<P>
 Force's Lumina made its debut with a 5.26-second run at the Budweiser Warm-Up 
two weeks ago at Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurlock, a flamboyant driver in the mold of Force, is returning to funny car 
competition after being away four years. He won the first event he entered, the 
1990 Winternationals, and was named NHRA rookie of the year that season. He has 
not raced since, but will be in a Dodge Daytona this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurlock is part of a new three-car team, VanLok Motorsports, which also 
includes Bob Vandergriff Jr. in a top fuel dragster and Gary Rettell in a top 
alcohol funny car. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other former Pomona winners, top fuel driver Connie Kalitta and pro stock 
veteran Darrell Alderman, are also making comebacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalitta, 55, who won the 1967 Winternationals in his Bounty Hunter fueler, is 
returning after a year's absence to be a teammate to his son, Scott, on the 
family-owned American International Airways team. 
</P>
<P>
 Alderman, 44, is a two-time pro stock champion returning from a two-year 
suspension for drug use. He will rejoin his old team, the Wayne County Speed 
Shop, as a teammate to Scott Geoffrion. In 1991, Alderman won 11 races, a pro 
stock record. 
</P>
<P>
 There are changes, too, in the top fuel lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Hill, the champion, will be back in his Pennzoil dragster as the oldest 
sponsored race driver in the country. Hill will be 58 next month. Also 
returning are five-time top fuel champion Joe Amato and four-time funny car 
champion Kenny Bernstein, still seeking his first top fuel championship. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cory McClenathan and Ed McCulloch, a couple of 300-m.p.h. racers, will be 
in different cars. McClenathan, who set an elapsed-time record of 4.762 seconds 
and had four runs of 300 m.p.h. or better in his family's car last year, has 
replaced McCulloch in the Larry Minor-owned McDonald's top fuel dragster. 
McCulloch, who had a 300-m.p.h. run at the Winston Finals, signed with 
baseball's Jack Clark to drive the Taco Bell dragster at Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 Another new two-driver team, Smokin' Joe's Racing, will have Jim Head in top 
fuel and Gordie Bonin in funny car. Bonin's car will mark the return of the old 
Candies and Hughes team. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Winternationals will start the Final Strike Tour for Don (Snake) 
Prudhomme, who has announced his retirement after the 1994 season. Prudhomme, 
who won more funny car races than anyone in the NHRA before returning to top 
fuel four years ago, will complete his career in the Skoal dragster. 
</P>
<P>
 A new top fuel driver making her American debut is Rachelle Splatt of 
Melbourne, Australia. Splatt, 24, will join Shelly Anderson as the only 
full-time female top fuel drivers in the NHRA. 
</P>
<P>
 Motor Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 COPPER WORLD -- The 17th annual Skoal Bandit Copper World Classic this weekend 
at Phoenix International Raceway will feature four distinctly different racing 
series: United States Auto Club midgets, super modifieds and Silver Crown dirt 
cars, and NASCAR Southwest Tour stock cars. Four reigning USAC champions -- Mel 
Kenyon, Indianapolis Speedrome midget series; Stevie Reeves, national midget 
series; Robby Flock, western regional midget series, and Mike Bliss, Silver 
Crown winner -- are among the entries. Ken Schrader, who has a record eight 
victories at Phoenix, will drive a Chevrolet Lumina in the Featherlite 
Southwest Tour race. It is the same car Schrader drove to victory in the Delco 
300 at Phoenix in 1982. All finals are Sunday, with 25-mile races for the 
midgets and super modifieds and 50 miles for the Silver Crown and Southwest 
Tour cars. 
</P>
<P>
 MOTOCROSS -- Jeremy McGrath, undefeated in three Camel Supercross events this 
season, will go for his fourth consecutive Saturday night victory in the Coors 
Light Challenge at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. McGrath, the defending series 
and San Diego champion on a Honda, was an easy winner last Saturday night at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 SPRINT CARS -- The competing California Racing Assn. and Sprint Car Racing 
Assn. will dilute the talent Saturday night when the CRA opens its season at 
Canyon Raceway, north of Phoenix, and the SCRA holds its races at Manzanita 
Speedway in Phoenix. Lealand McSpadden, switching from Frank Lewis' car to Andy 
Morales' Tamale Wagon, will face Northern California champion Brent Kaeding at 
Canyon, while former CRA champions Ron Shuman and Brad Noffsinger will be at 
Manzanita. Noffsinger, a racing instructor in Concord, N.H., will be taking his 
first sprint car ride in two years. Mike Kirby, the defending CRA champion, 
will also race with the new SCRA organization. 
</P>
<P>
 INDY CARS -- The Toyota Monterey Grand Prix at Laguna Seca Raceway, final 
event of the 16-race PPG Cup series, has been moved from its original date of 
Oct. 2 to Oct. 9 to accommodate ESPN's television schedule. . . . Mark Smith of 
McMinnville, Ore., who drove last year for Frank Arciero, has signed to drive a 
'94 Lola-Ford Cosworth for Derrick Walker's team, which also includes Robby 
Gordon and Willy T. Ribbs. . . . Dan Gurney and his All American Racers in 
Santa Ana have received the green light by Toyota to conduct an Indy car 
research and development program to determine whether Toyota is in a position 
to undertake a full Indy car racing effort. 
</P>
<P>
 MOTORCYCLES -- The 14th annual Adelanto Grand Prix, staged by the Desert 
Vipers Motorcycle Club and the city of Adelanto, is scheduled Saturday and 
Sunday. The 10-mile Grand Prix course incorporates city streets, desert roads 
and trails and a man-made motocross course. There will be 12 races in the 
two-day event. . . . Floyd Emde, the first motorcyclist to be named to the San 
Diego Automotive Museum's Hall of Fame, will be inducted Saturday night at the 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
 STOCK CARS -- Imperial Raceway in El Centro will feature IMCA modifieds and 
pro and factory stocks in its Saturday night program. 
</P>
<P>

LOYOLA PRESSES HARVARD, PULLS OUT 71-62 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just ask Tonya Harding or the Harvard-Westlake High basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to avoid the press. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola pressed and trapped the Wolverines into turnover after turnover and 
beat Harvard, 71-62, in a Mission League game Wednesday night at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's our style," Loyola Coach Bill Thomason said. "We have to make them 
play a full-court game. If we play two half-court games, we just get posted up 
to death." 
</P>
<P>
 That posting-up-to-death would have been done by Harvard's 6-foot-7 twins, 
Jason and Jarron Collins, but the freshmen got into foul trouble, each 
collecting three in the first half to complicate matters at both ends of the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We break the press with the big guys," Harvard Coach Greg Hilliard said. 
"Most of those turnovers were passes to Jason and he was afraid to go hard 
after it (because of the fouls). But they're young." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines' chances for a Mission League championship were all but ended 
with the loss. Harvard (18-2, 8-2 in league) has lost twice to Loyola (15-5, 
10-0). 
</P>
<P>
 But the Cubs' press was not so effective in the first meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "They trapped more this time," senior Scott Garson said. "This defense is 
really tenacious. Maybe they were fired up playing in their gym." 
</P>
<P>
 Garson was one of the bright spots for Harvard. He scored 25 points. Jason 
Collins added 16 points and Jarron Collins had 12 and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Moose Bailey scored 24 points and senior Toby Bailey, his brother who 
is headed to UCLA, had 23 for Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines dominated the early part of the game, capping a 13-0 run from 
the opening tip with a dunk by Jason Collins. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola then employed its press and pared the lead, mostly because of a 
hot-shooting half by Moose Bailey, who had 18 points at the break. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs tied the score, 32-32, on a put-back by Bobby Thomason in the closing 
seconds of the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola started the second half by jumping to 47-38 lead, taking advantage of 
turnovers and the Collins twins' foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard, which had not allowed more than 65 points all season, settled down 
and pulled back to within, 60-58, in the fourth quarter, but again, turnovers 
cost the Wolverines as Loyola bumped the lead to 67-60 with 2 minutes 30 
seconds to play.

KINGSMEN SHOW LA VERNE THAT IT'S A NEW YEAR, 87-73; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: CAL 
LUTHERAN REVERSES THE OUTCOME OF TWO CRITICAL LOSSES TO LEOPARDS LAST SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For Cal Lutheran's Rupert Sapwell, Wednesday night's Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference basketball game against La Verne was a 
chance for the Kingsmen to get some redemption. 
</P>
<P>
 To Cal Lutheran Coach Mike Dunlap, it was simply one of 14 SCIAC games the 
Kingsmen will play this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, Cal Lutheran won, 87-73, to stay tied for first place in the SCIAC 
with Pomona-Pitzer, a 94-90 winner over Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always great to beat La Verne," Sapwell said. "Last year, they were kind 
of our voodoo team, so to speak. They knocked us out of the playoffs, so we had 
all summer to dwell on it and get ready for this." 
</P>
<P>
 La Verne (8-10, 4-3 in conference play) tied Cal Lutheran (17-1, 6-1) for the 
SCIAC title last season, but defeated the Kingsmen in a playoff game to 
determine the conference's automatic entry in the NCAA Division III playoffs 
before knocking them off again in the second round of postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've held a grudge for a long time," Sapwell said. "So this is a really nice 
win for us. . . . We were more pumped up for this game than any other game this 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 Sapwell played a major role in Cal Lutheran's victory; he scored 25 points and 
grabbed nine rebounds to go along with five blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Working inside most of the game, Sapwell made nine of 12 shots, although his 
free-throw shooting (seven of 13) left something to be desired. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't plan to go inside that much," Dunlap said. "But when when we found 
out we could score in there, when we discovered a soft spot, we definitely 
started getting the ball inside, either by the pass or the dribble." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul LaMott, a 6-foot-6 junior transfer from Irvine Valley College, also had a 
big night inside for Cal Lutheran, scoring 14 points and hitting all six of his 
field goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 After trailing, 36-28, at halftime, La Verne narrowed its deficit to 50-44 
with 13 minutes left, but the Kingsmen did not allow the Leopards to draw any 
closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran extended its lead to 68-56 with 5:27 left and La Verne never came 
closer than eight points the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen gave the Leopards plenty of chances with some sloppy ball 
handling and several missed free throws, but they recovered in time to score 
points on their final five possessions to win going away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't use revenge to motivate the guys at all," Dunlap said when asked 
about last year's losses. "Sometimes that can be disastrous. If it means to 
much to you, you tend to play tight. I just wanted the guys to go out there and 
play hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Damon Ridley added 15 points for Cal Lutheran, Derrick Clark had 14 points and 
10 rebounds, and Paul Tapp scored 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Courseault finished with 29 points for La Verne after being held to five 
points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Courseault finished with 10-for-25 shooting from the field after hitting only 
two of 10 shots before intermission.

MUFF'S DEATH DULY NOTICED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was saddened to learn of the death of (Crespi High basketball) Coach Paul 
Muff.At a time when athletics at all levels of competition are being splintered 
by greed, unsportsmanlike behavior and general lack of direction, Paul was the 
epitome of class and sportsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a fierce competitor, yet a gracious loser and winner. Today's young 
coaches should copy this man's approach to athletics and young people. I will 
miss him.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: CSUN COACH LEFT TO PONDER SILVER LINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tearful, distraught woman approached Mike Johnson on Monday night, an 
offering in her trembling hand.  
</P>
<P>
 The woman recognized Johnson, a Northridge basketball assistant, from a 
television segment broadcast in South Bend, Ind., the day of the Matadors' game 
against Notre Dame. On it, Johnson answered questions about the devastating 
effects of the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 His replies obviously struck an emotional chord. Johnson said the woman 
expressed how lucky Notre Dame fans and the residents of South Bend were that 
they did not fall victim to such tragedies. She said that she wished she could 
be of some help to the Northridge players who lost their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Take this, she said, thrusting some money in Johnson's direction. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Johnson declined. But then he gave in, accepting the gift when it 
became obvious that the woman was not going to take no for an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 The donation: $7. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how much good I can do with it, but at least it made her feel 
better," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 As word of the incident spread, Johnson took a lot of ribbing. 
</P>
<P>
 When he boarded the flight back to Los Angeles, Athletic Director Bob Hiegert 
approached Johnson and offered him a quarter. "Here," Hiegert said, "I saw you 
on TV and wanted to make a contribution." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Hiegert gave another quarter to a flight attendant and set her up to 
make a similar donation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson, who is paid less than $5,000 to do the work of a full-time 
assistant, got the last laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 He sent the following message back to Hiegert: 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks for doubling my salary." CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
 Wowed by Mystery Guest 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors had a surprise visitor at the end of their Monday afternoon 
practice before the game that night against Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Northridge players were preparing to leave Joyce Center, in walked Lou 
Holtz, the Fighting Irish football coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Holtz signed autographs, posed for pictures and shook hands with the 
Northridge contingent for about 15 minutes, pausing to confide that he once 
wanted to be a basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He indicated that (coaching basketball) is very simple," Northridge Coach 
Pete Cassidy said. "He said that basically if one team shoots 45% and the other 
only shoots 38%, then that means the second team needs to work on shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 Just like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "He also indicated that there were only three officials in basketball to 
contend with and he had far too many in football to contend with, so that's 
another reason coaching basketball was simple," Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than argue, Cassidy chose to grin and bear it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him that I appreciated him simplifying the game so much for me, that I 
was very grateful." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most awe-struck among the Northridge contingent during Holtz's visit was 
Mike Cassidy, the youngest son of the Northridge coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike, once a standout point guard at Notre Dame High, had been attempting to 
meet Holtz for years. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, it appeared he might miss him again. 
</P>
<P>
 When Northridge first arrived for practice, a Northridge assistant coach went 
to Holtz's office to ask if the coach might be able to swing by for a few 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 A secretary said that Holtz had been out of town the past two weeks and had "a 
hundred meetings." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike DiCiccio, Notre Dame's fencing coach and a friend of one of Pete 
Cassidy's close friends, apparently persuaded Holtz to find the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was really nice of Mike DiCiccio," Cassidy said, "and a very class thing 
for Lou Holtz to do." 
</P>
<P>
 For Mike Cassidy, meeting Holtz was the climax of a rather eventful day. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, he and a small group of Northridge followers sneaked into Notre 
Dame's historic football stadium. Cassidy walked onto the snow-covered field, 
faked as if gathering in a kickoff in the end zone, and jogged the length of 
the field, juking several make-believe defenders along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Asked after the game how the earthquake and thousands of ensuing aftershocks 
might affect recruiting, Pete Cassidy was at his comedic best. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would expect that just out of natural curiosity we'd get a lot of visits," 
he said. "Now whether we can sign them or not. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 When pressed by reporters, Cassidy refused to give in, deadpanning that 
because disaster presumably never strikes in the same place twice that 
Northridge "might be the safest place for everyone to come to." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how recruits were responding, Cassidy replied, "They say, 'That's right, 
coach. Hey, you're really up on your geology.' " 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Tom Manning, an assistant sports information director at Northridge, has had 
enough. The elements have conspired against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning is leaving his post this weekend and moving back to the area around 
Chicago, his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning and his wife have lived in the Southland for 3 1/2 years.  
</P>
<P>
 In that time, he has seen the region experience debilitating earthquakes, 
brush fires, riots and floods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been quite an interesting time," said Manning, tongue firmly in cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning said he plans to enroll in graduate school. CAL LUTHERAN 
</P>
<P>
 Tough to Overcome 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Mike Dunlap knew the Kingsmen were in trouble after the first half of 
last week's 87-72 loss to Claremont-Mudd, and it wasn't only because they were 
losing by 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of plays before the intermission made Dunlap realize that Cal 
Lutheran's season-opening 15-game winning streak was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Claremont-Mudd scored after a Stag pass deflected off the hands of 
Kingsmen forward Derrick Clark and into the basket.  
</P>
<P>
 Then Claremont-Mudd guard Darren Gravley rebounded a Cal Lutheran miss with 
four seconds left in the half, drove the length of court and made an 
off-balance hook shot as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 "He threw up a prayer, but it was answered," Dunlap said. "It was just that 
type of a game for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran didn't help its cause by hitting only 21 of 57 shots from the 
field -- including six of 26 from three-point range -- but Dunlap blamed the 
anemic percentages on impatience more than poor marksmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We turned the ball over too much (20 times) and our shot selection was poor," 
he said. "There were times when our offense consisted of three passes and a 
chuck." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran's 101-41 victory over Caltech on Saturday could have been more 
decisive if Dunlap had played any of his starters more than 23 minutes, and it 
made one wonder how the Beavers (0-6 in SCIAC play entering Wednesday night's 
game against Claremont-Mudd) compiled an 8-0 record in pre-conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit a very weak schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech, which has lost 57 consecutive games in the SCIAC entering play 
Wednesday, defeated teams such as California Maritime Academy, Arizona College 
of Bible, L.I.F.E. Bible and Holy Names College. Around the Campuses . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * Brooklyn McLinn needs two three-point baskets to become Northridge's 
all-time leader in that department. The senior from Woodland Hills has made 120 
of 336 attempts. Derrick Gathers is the Matador record-holder both in 
three-point baskets and attempts. He made 121 of 347 from 1988-90. 
</P>
<P>
 * In one game, Andre Chevalier went from fifth to first on the Northridge 
career list for free throws. Chevalier, a senior from Landover, Md., made seven 
from the line against Northeastern Illinois, giving him 335 and moving him past 
Todd Bowser (328), Darren Matsubara (329), Pat Bolden (329) and Jim Malkin 
(332) on the Matadors' all-time list.  
</P>
<P>
 * Ventura continues to be the top-ranked men's basketball team in the state. 
The Pirates (27-1) had a 27-game winning streak going into Wednesday's Western 
State Conference game at Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 * Moorpark freshman forward Paul Foster was second in the state with a 66.4 
field-goal percentage (142 of 214) in the latest statistics released by the 
California JC Athletic Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sophomore guard Danny Prince of Antelope Valley started the week as the top 
three-point shooter among Foothill Conference players. Prince had made 125 of 
291 (43.0%) three-point attempts. He was third in the conference in scoring 
with a 21.7-point average. 
</P>
<P>
 * Emeka Okenwa of The Master's has been named the NAIA Far West Region 
Independents player of the week. Okenwa, a 6-foot-7, 230-pound center from 
Lagos, Nigeria, totaled 43 points and 21 rebounds in Mustang victories over Cal 
State San Bernardino and Cal State Dominguez Hills last week. 
</P>
<P>
 * Master's (21-3) still has six games left in the regular season, yet the 
Mustangs have already moved into a tie for third on the school's single-season 
victory list. Master's posted a 21-11 record during the 1969-70 season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Master's has shot 50.4% from the field during its current 10-game winning 
streak, but defense has been the biggest key to the Mustangs' success. 
Opponents have made only 41.8% of their shots during the streak. 
</P>
<P>
 * When Cal Lutheran swingman Jason Smith was sidelined by a knee injury at the 
start of Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference play, Coach 
Mike Dunlap said that Rupert Sapwell, Derrick Clark and Damon Ridley would have 
to pick up the rebounding slack left by Smith's absence. The trio had heeded 
their coach's call entering Wednesday night's game at La Verne as Sapwell 
(per-game average of 7.1 rebounds), Clark (7.8) and Ridley (4.8) were averaging 
9.3, 8.5 and 6.0 in SCIAC play.

 For Brandon Martin, a starting guard at USC, the thought of playing in 
tonight's basketball game against fourth-ranked UCLA is enough to make his 
shooting hand twitch. 
</P>
<P>
 But of far greater importance is the matter of survival, said Martin, a former 
standout at Cleveland High. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot more to this game than people think," he said. "It's not just 
the rivalry, but our entire season hinges on this game." 
</P>
<P>
 Not because it's the Bruins (14-1, 7-1 in Pacific 10 Conference play), who 
were ranked No. 1 last week before falling to California on Sunday, but because 
USC cannot afford to lose its sixth consecutive conference game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans started the season 10-2, 3-0 in Pac-10 play, but look what has 
happened since: 
</P>
<P>
 * Washington State 89, USC 59 
</P>
<P>
 * Arizona State 87, USC 62 
</P>
<P>
 * Arizona 83, USC 74 
</P>
<P>
 * Cal 77, USC 68 
</P>
<P>
 * Stanford 76, USC 67 
</P>
<P>
 Five consecutive defeats, by margins of 30, 25 and nine in each of the past 
three, have put Martin's team on red alert at 10-7, 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point of the season we can't look back at those games," said Martin, 
a 6-foot-4 shooting guard. "We have to find a way to beat UCLA and stay 
optimistic about the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we beat UCLA, that could be the turning point of the season. We could 
finish out stronger than we even started." 
</P>
<P>
 It won't be easy. The Bruins average 89.1 points a game and lead the Pac-10 in 
rebounding (45.1 per game) and shooting (50.5% from the field). They also limit 
opponents to 39.8% shooting from the field, best in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Martin points out, "We've beaten UCLA the last three out of four times we 
played them at Pauley (Pavilion). The team has to stay motivated." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, a sophomore, likely will be matched against UCLA senior Shon Tarver 
from Santa Clara High. Both are averaging 13.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited. Last year I was suited up but didn't get a chance to play," 
Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't a matter of winning a starting job this season but of waiting one's 
turn. When Martin signed to attend USC two years ago, he was compared to Harold 
Miner. Martin averaged 31 points his senior season at Washington High. He 
transferred to Washington because he was tired of long bus rides, wanted to 
play at his neighborhood school and was concerned about a high turnover of 
coaches at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 But Martin first made a name for himself at Cleveland, averaging 13 points as 
a sophomore and 26 as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year was a learning experience. In high school he was merely a scorer, 
running the floor, spotting up for jump shots or driving for baskets. But at 
USC, he has been forced to learn to play defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "(USC) Coach (George) Raveling always told me it's a matter of mental 
discipline," Martin said. "Think rebound, rebound, rebound instead of getting 
back down the floor. It's helped me. It's given me a greater appreciation of 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had to rate myself, though, I'd probably have to give me 70%. I've done 
a lot of good things, but there are things to get better at." 
</P>
<P>
 At least Martin is starting to provide the kind of offense he displayed in 
high school. Three times he has scored 18 points this season, and during the 
five-game losing streak he scored 23 against Washington State and 24 against 
Cal (including four three-pointers). 
</P>
<P>
 Martin ranks eighth in the Pac-10 in three-point shooting percentage (40.3%) 
and 10th in free-throw percentage (78%). And he handles the ball well. He has 
the fewest turnovers of any player in the conference with at least 400 minutes. 
He has 14 in 492 minutes -- or one every 35.3 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Guards usually rank among players with the most turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm starting to feel more comfortable and I'm doing things I'm confident in 
doing," Martin said. "And that's scoring." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Checking the fax: Forward Reggie Bell (College of the Canyons) leads Quincy 
University with a shooting percentage of 61.8%, a scoring average of 19.2 
points and a rebounding average of 11.1. . . . New Orleans point guard Tony 
Madison (Antelope Valley College) is averaging 11.5 points but scored 20 for 
the second time this season, last week against Southwestern Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
 In women's basketball, Oregon State sophomore guard Anjanette Dionne (Hart) is 
averaging 8.6 points and is tied for fourth in the Pac-10 in steals (2.9). . . 
. Oregon senior center Sara Wilson (Hart) is averaging 7.3 rebounds overall and 
16.1 points in Pac-10 play.

HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP; NORTH HOLLYWOOD WINS BY 65 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The North Hollywood Huskies enjoyed their biggest scoring night and largest 
victory margin of the season Wednesday in defeating Sherman Oaks CES, 112-47. 
</P>
<P>
 Four North Hollywood players posted double-doubles. Damon Ollie had 27 points 
and 21 rebounds; Arthur Lee had 16 points and 14 assists; Fantasia Johnson 14 
points and 15 assists, and Terry Smith-Harris added 16 points and 14 rebounds. 
Twelve North Hollywood players scored, five of them reaching double figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies, ranked second in the Valley area by The Times, improved to 10-5, 
5-0 in Valley Pac-8 Conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake 62, Thousand Oaks 58 -- Warrior guard Steve Aylsworth scored 13 of 
his game-high 25 points in the fourth quarter to propel Westlake to a Marmonte 
League comeback victory at Thousand Oaks (16-6, 7-3).  
</P>
<P>
 Westlake (13-5, 7-3) trailed by eight at halftime, 34-26. Jason Hartman led 
the Lancers with 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell-Jeff 65, La Salle 64 -- The Guards trailed, 51-39, at the end of three 
quarters, then Dan Mancinelli scored 14 of his 25 points in the final period. 
Mancinelli also had 10 rebounds.  
</P>
<P>
 With just under four minutes left, Anthony Couch (15 points) stole the ball 
and made a layup at the other end to give Bell-Jeff a 58-57 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 La Salle used the final 23 seconds to try for a winning shot, but a 
three-point attempt with one second left was an air ball. The Guards improved 
to 8-13, 3-4 in the Camino Real League. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal 36, Camarillo 35 (OT) -- Scott Hambly sank a free throw with two seconds 
remaining in overtime for the only points of the extra period, lifting Royal to 
a Marmonte League victory at Camarillo. Camarillo held the ball the final three 
minutes of regulation, working for the final shot, but Nathan Kaup missed a 
baseline jumper at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura 54, Oxnard 51 -- Cougar guard Ryan Studt made the winning free throws 
with 20 seconds left in a Channel League game at Ventura (8-11, 5-6). Studt's 
two shots gave the Cougars a 52-51 lead, and after an Oxnard miss, Ventura 
forward John-Ryan Kern closed the scoring with two more free throws. Kern 
scored a game-high 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Poly 66, Canoga Park 51 -- Darrin Drew scored 15 points for the Parrots in a 
Mid-Valley League game at Poly (9-5, 4-2). Jaime Cerna added 13 points and 13 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant 60, South Gate 52 -- Ron Patterson scored 14 points and added four 
steals to pace the visiting Lancers (13-3) in a nonleague contest. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first game for Grant since 6-foot-8 center Rick Forscutt moved to 
Utah with his family, and the Lancers had a difficult time adjusting to the 
loss, entering the locker room at halftime tied, 27-27. 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep 66, Maranatha 53 -- Wes Hinkston scored 10 of his 12 points in 
the fourth period as host Montclair Prep snapped a 42-42 tie and rolled to a 
nonleague victory.  
</P>
<P>
 Akil Anderson had 14 points and eight assists and Reed Berglund added 14 
points for Montclair Prep (15-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame 73, Crespi 46 -- Rich Igou had 13 points to lead four Notre Dame

WESTSIDE WATCH: ROOTS OF BEVERLY HILLS STREETS GO DEEPER THAN MOVIE ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's time to lay to rest some myths about the origins of the names of two 
Beverly Hills streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to the belief of some residents, Arnaz Drive was not named for Desi 
Arnaz, nor does Peck Drive honor Gregory Peck. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnaz Drive owes its name to Don Jose de Arnaz, who purchased the nearby 
Rancho Rincon de los Bueyes sometime between 1864 and 1875, according to the 
1934 "History of Beverly Hills," by Pierce E. Benedict and Don Kennedy. De 
Arnaz also founded the city of Ventura and opened the first drugstore in San 
Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Peck Drive was named for C.L. Peck, whose Peck Building, at the corner of 
present-day Beverly Drive and little Santa Monica Boulevard, was the city's 
central business structure in the early part of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other street facts: 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier Drive has no connection to poet John Greenleaf Whittier or former 
President Richard M. Nixon's hometown, but gets its name from Max Whittier, an 
early resident and an organizer of the Rodeo Land & Water Co., which developed 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Spalding Drive is named for the city's first mayor, Silsby M. Spalding, and 
Clark Drive for Percy Clark, the first agent who sold land in the Beverly Hills 
tract. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 BE PREPARED: Here's something you probably forgot to include in your 
earthquake kit. Adam Glickman is introducing the official condom of "The 1994 
Great L.A. Quake." 
</P>
<P>
 "In this world of AIDS, unwanted pregnancies combined with two-hour lines at 
the market, no power, no lights and nowhere to go, perhaps a condom in an 
earthquake kit is not such a crazy idea," said Glickman, president of a 
nationwide condom boutique based on Melrose. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the first time Glickman has tried to capitalize on a disaster. 
Glickman's company, Condomania, created the "Official 1992 L.A. Riot Condom" 
featuring the slogan, "When in L.A. Use Your Protective Gear." 
</P>
<P>
 He said sales of the riot condom raised several hundred dollars for local 
shelters. Proceeds from sales of the quake condom will be donated to the 
Earthquake Relief Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Glickman said his campaign may be just the antidote for the post-quake blues. 
"The people of Los Angeles need something to laugh about," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 After, maybe. Never during. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SECOND TRY: Sen. Tom Hayden once tried to require that universities notify 
students when their buildings do not meet seismic standards, only to have his 
proposal set aside by the Legislature amid protests by lobbyists for the 
University of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in the wake of the Jan. 17 quake that shook much of Southern California 
and caused significant damage at the campus of Cal State Northridge, he's 
trying again. 
</P>
<P>
 Only this time, not just college deans, but also property owners, hospital 
administrators and public and private employers would have to notify students, 
tenants, home buyers, patients and employees that their buildings are not up to 
current safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a minimum, Californians should be told that the buildings they're in 
couldn't be built under modern quake standards," Hayden said. "That way, they 
can make an informed decision whether they want to risk their lives in that 
building."

YOUNG RAPPERS DISH OUT POSITIVE VIBES; ENTERTAINMENT: THERE'S NO MINCING WORDS 
ON THURSDAY NIGHTS AT THE GOOD LIFE RESTAURANT, WHERE FRESH ARTISTS TEST THE 
HIP-HOP WATERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the Good Life Restaurant on Crenshaw Boulevard, a capacity crowd of about 
200 is hunkering down for an old-fashioned showdown. This duel, however, is 
about words, not guns, and the players are firing scattershot rap lyrics rather 
than bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 rappers crowd the small, brightly lighted stage, passing a microphone 
during the "freestyle" warm-up of the restaurant's Hip Hop Night. The 
performers, some swinging their arms nervously as they await their turn and 
others the picture of studied cool, reflect the diversity of the audience: 
Latino, African American and one white rapper. 
</P>
<P>
 In the four years it has been running, Hip Hop Night at the Good Life has 
established itself as the city's premier spot for fresh faces in rap, 
attracting not only hopeful performers, but also music industry types and the 
likes of film director John Singleton, who recently passed through shopping for 
an artist for his new record label.  
</P>
<P>
 From South Central to Long Beach to the San Fernando Valley, rappers of all 
persuasions and philosophies make their way on Thursday nights to the 
health-food spot along the Crenshaw strip for a chance to test the hip-hop 
waters or simply to check out what's new on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 On a typical Thursday, a warm-up session of "passing the mike" is followed by 
an hourlong concert, which showcases new and veteran Good Life artists who have 
signed up at the door and eagerly await their moments of glory. 
</P>
<P>
 Subjects of the improvised rap bites range from police brutality to romantic 
interludes, but conspicuously absent from the verbal assault is the profanity 
that peppers most hard-hitting rap. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't believe health is restricted to the body," said the restaurant's 
owner, who goes only by the name Omar. "Hip-hop can be positive and deal with 
the spiritual side of things. All we do is provide the venue." 
</P>
<P>
 In four years, Hip Hop Night has graduated 25 artists and groups who have 
signed recording contracts, including the Pharcyde, Urban Prop, S.I.N., the 
Alkaholiks and the Wraskals. Veteran rappers such as Biz Markie and Ice-T 
frequently stop by and are pressed into rocking the mike themselves. The Watts 
Prophets, the local granddaddies of rap with roots in the socially conscious 
'60s, also put in appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a place where everyone -- teen-agers, kids, their parents -- feel 
comfortable together," said Bee Hall, 49, founder of Youths for Positive 
Alternatives, a local nonprofit organization that sponsors Hip Hop Night. "You 
pay $3 to get in, and you can express yourself. That's the reason for the 
longevity of this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 For 24-year-old Ola Kennedy, the weekly event helps more than just rappers. 
"I'm a producer, and I look for new acts all the time," said Kennedy, one of 
the original performers at the restaurant who have since moved into other 
aspects of the music business. "This is a real training spot for rappers. Some 
are great, some are not so great, but it has a real reputation for turning out 
talent. People know the Good Life now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Good Life Health Food Centre began hosting the open-mike night for 
aspiring rappers in December, 1989. Three UCLA students in search of a regular 
community forum for hip-hop artists met with Hall, whose organization seeks to 
provide artistically inclined teen-agers with business and entrepreneurial 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall persuaded the owners of the Good Life, at that time on the verge of 
opening their restaurant and seeking live entertainment, to provide a space for 
rappers, graffiti artists and other young people who lacked creative outlets. 
Every Thursday night at eight, the restaurant's few tables and folding chairs 
are shoved aside to make room for Hip Hop patrons, who begin filing in at 7:45 
and are standing shoulder-to-shoulder half an hour later. The $3 admission goes 
to benefit Hall's youth foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The ground rules laid for rappers were in keeping with Hall's philosophy and 
the Good Life's emphasis on clean living and well-being -- no profanity or 
denigration of women or ethnic heritage is allowed. If a rapper tries to bend 
the rules, he or she is in danger of having the mike disconnected by the host. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to alter people's consciousness," said R. Kain Blaze, a guitarist and 
one of the founding members of Hip Hop Night, initially called Underground 
Radio Live. "I'm really a musician, not a rapper, but this was created to let 
other people come in and do their thing. That's my main reason for wanting to 
perpetuate it."

ARTS; PHOTOGRAPHY IS HER OWN POETIC JUSTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE MOFFET, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inside Linda Macaluso's West Los Angeles apartment, two spotlights shine on 
three large Plexiglass-covered posters on her wall. 
</P>
<P>
 In one, Silver Lake author Malcolm Boyd stares thoughtfully toward the camera; 
in another, Washington state poet Tess Gallagher wears a soft, expectant look; 
in the third, Downtown Los Angeles writer "Dr. Mongo" (Mongo Taribubu) stares 
seriously off-camera into darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 On each image, a poem by the pictured poet is printed in English and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the most prolific photographic chronicler of Southern California 
poetry readings -- and a published poet herself -- Macaluso, 46, began taking 
such photographs on impulse in 1982, when she barely knew the difference 
between telephoto and wide-angle lenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Macaluso learned as she went, taking photography classes at Santa Monica 
College for four years as she continued documenting poetry readings. Over the 
years, she has accumulated thousands of images. 
</P>
<P>
 Her goal, she said, is to improve the visibility of poets, whom she considers 
social catalysts. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I didn't believe in the power of poetry to change the world, I wouldn't 
write poetry and I wouldn't go to poetry readings and I certainly wouldn't 
photograph poets," Macaluso said. "These photos are really just giving body to 
what poets are doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Her photographs have been exhibited several times and have appeared in 
magazines and on the jackets of books and compact discs by Los Angeles area 
writers, including Holly Prado, Henry Morro and Lee Rossi. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, with the help of a $10,000 grant from the Los Angeles Cultural 
Affairs Department, multiple copies of Macaluso's three posters were placed in 
bus shelters in 15 Los Angeles council districts in time for the Los Angeles 
Poetry Festival. They were on display for about three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Macaluso said she viewed the posters "as ads for poetry." She added: "I find 
it tickling that they appeared next to Gap, Tom Cruise, Bugle Boy. It seems 
almost postmodern." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd said Macaluso has photographed him "dozens of times," often when he was 
unaware of it. That's good news to Macaluso, who makes a point not to disrupt 
readings. 
</P>
<P>
 Macaluso occasionally strays from photographing poets. Her non-literary 
pictures have appeared in Southern California Home and Garden, Skateboard 
Industry News and other publications. "I have more portfolios than God," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately she has not been able to photograph more than three poetry readings or 
so each month. She was laid off in June from her job as a legal secretary and 
has found only temporary positions since then. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being out of work and just having to scrounge for the money for film is hard 
for me," she said. Her photography also has been sidetracked by illnesses to 
her parents and to her sister. Macaluso also has had surgery to remove a 
non-malignant growth from her breast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do everything myself. If I don't have the energy or if my personal life 
intrudes, nothing happens," Macaluso said. These days she's occasionally paid 
to photograph Lannan Foundation poetry readings at the Pacific Design Center, 
but most of her work is done free. 
</P>
<P>
 She's trying to find another full-time secretarial position. She'd also like 
to find grant support to allow her to make more poetry posters and put them on 
public display in several cities; someday she'd like to publish a book of her 
photos. 
</P>
<P>
 What keeps her going, she said, is a deep faith in poetry's importance. She 
has written many poems herself, publishing them in L.A. Weekly and elsewhere, 
including the now-defunct literary journals Tsunami and Poetry/LA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poetry has saved a lot of people's lives. It's saved my life more than once," 
she said.

BRIEFLY: ENVIRONMENT: PLANTING NATIVE FLORA ON POINT DUME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A campaign to plant more native vegetation on the Point Dume headlands starts 
this weekend with a coastal restoration organized by the state Department of 
Parks and Recreation and the Malibu chapter of the environmental group Heal the 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 From 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday, volunteers will remove non-native plants and 
replace them with native seedlings in an effort to restore the headlands to a 
natural state that would support more animals that are native to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers are asked to take Pacific Coast Highway north to Heathercliff Road. 
Turn left on Heathercliff and left on Dume Drive. Turn right on Cliffside Drive 
and park on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a Heal the Bay banner at the entrance to the Point Dume Nature 
Preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Comfortable clothes, sturdy shoes and a hat or sunscreen are recommended.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CULVER CITY; PLAN TO EASE SCHOOL CROWDING UNVEILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to ease overcrowding in elementary schools, district officials 
have decided to reopen El Marino Elementary this fall, but only for 
foreign-language students. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's Spanish-language immersion program at El Rincon Elementary and 
the Japanese-language immersion program at Farragut Elementary will be 
transferred to El Marino. Students in the Japanese and Spanish immersion 
programs spend 90% of their time studying in the foreign language and 10% in 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 Superintendent Curtis Rethmeyer said he anticipates El Marino's enrollment to 
be 350 to 400 students. The district will spend about $1 million for structural 
and operational rehabilitation to prepare the school for reopening. 
</P>
<P>
 El Marino, which closed in 1981 because of low enrollment, has been leased to 
a number of private schools. The lease on the current tenant, Westside Prep, 
expires in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 2,100 elementary students in the district attend four schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the schools have reached their capacity," said James Crawford, the 
district's business director. Last fall, elementary enrollment increased 6%. 
Officials added portable classrooms at all four schools. 
</P>
<P>
 El Marino is a few hundred yards from Culver Park High, a school for students 
who have missed at least a semester. El Marino's proximity to Culver Park High 
prompted parents to circulate a petition asking the district to find an 
alternative site for the elementary school. About 600 signatures were 
collected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel it's unacceptable for 6-year-olds and 16-year-olds to be (close to) 
each other," said Kelly Pullan, whose two children attend El Rincon. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I fear is the exposure," Pullan said. "Nowadays, a lot of teens use bad 
language and smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 But Asst. Supt. Vera Jashni said the district doesn't have the money to lease 
another site. "If we lease, we're looking at $200,000 per year. So do teachers 
miss out on a salary increase if we lease?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Rethmeyer said there is no cause for concern. "We've had that (continuation 
school) program there for 12 years. We've had private schools leasing (El 
Marino) and there have been no problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pullan said her group will seek corporate sponsorship to help the district buy 
another school site.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW; ART EXHIBIT FOR BLACK HISTORY MONTH IS LARGEST IN 
NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 12th annual Artists' Salute to Black History Month, the largest exhibit of 
black art in the country, opened Wednesday at Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 150 exhibitors from 22 states are displaying paintings, ceramics, 
sculptures, quilts, lithographs, serigraphs, drawings, wearable art and 
mixed-media works on the plaza's two levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Several opportunities to chat with artists are planned. Among those exhibiting 
are Synthia St. James, William Tolliver, Bernard Stanley Hoyes, Sylvia Walker, 
Albert Mukasa Williams and Varnette Honeywood. A "Legends" exhibit will feature 
works by Benny Andrews, Claude Clark, Samella Lewis and Charles White. Painter 
Jacob Lawrence will conduct a symposium at 7 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's theme is "Our Children . . . Our Hope." Exhibit coordinator 
Barbara Wesson has planned several children's events, including storytelling 
sessions, crafts workshops, mask-making workshops, mime performances, juggling 
and a parade Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 "I want to honor more than just specially gifted children, but those who are 
really trying and improving," Wesson said of the parade and ceremony. "We're 
recognizing 200 'most improved' kids from neighborhood schools to give more 
young people a nod of appreciation." 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit will run from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. through Friday; 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
Saturday, and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LADERA HEIGHTS; PROPOSED LIMITS ON LABORERS PROTESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In yet another chapter in the conflict between day laborers and residents, a 
group of civil rights advocates gathered last week at a Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors meeting to protest a proposal that would prohibit day 
laborers from soliciting work on public streets and in private parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 About two dozen day laborers, members of the American Civil Liberties Union, 
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and other groups staged the 
demonstration, saying the proposed ordinance is racist and unconstitutional. 
After the Jan. 25 demonstration, the board postponed a vote on the ordinance 
for 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "These workers are engaged in speech protected by the 1st Amendment," said 
Ramona Ripston, executive director of the local ACLU. "They have a right to 
solicit work." Residents have complained for years about day laborers loitering 
near the HomeBase home improvement store at Slauson and Fairfax avenues. Last 
year, Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, the board's chairwoman and Ladera 
Heights representative, took action. She drafted a measure that would ban day 
laborers from soliciting work in public places and privately owned parking 
lots. Violations could result in $1,000 in fines and imprisonment for workers 
and their employers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was immediately assailed by civil rights advocates, who charged that the 
area's mostly affluent homeowners were trying to drive out mostly poor Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "All labor is dignity," said Joe Hicks, executive director of the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference. "Why are we trying to criminalize the 
activities of people who are simply offering themselves for a full day's work?" 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second time the supervisors have postponed voting on the measure 
to allow for mediation. Talks that started two months ago stagnated and need 
more time to progress, said Vicki Pipkin, a spokeswoman for Burke. 
</P>
<P>
 Pipkin said some supervisors suggested after the demonstration that a national 
mediating group be brought in. "Some homeowners felt that the day laborers 
weren't really speaking for themselves," she said. "We're going to try to get a 
fresh start." ERIN J. AUBRY

<P>
 Under an agreement with the Beverly Hills League of Women Voters, the eight 
candidates for the two open City Council seats have agreed to limit their 
campaign expenditures to no more than $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 League president Dorothy Kaufman said candidates had spent more than $100,000 
in past elections.The limit reflects a $10,000 inflationary increase over the 
1992 restriction on expenses, which typically cover campaign materials, mailing 
and event costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Contenders in the April 12 election include three first-time candidates and an 
incumbent. The winners will serve four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates' forums have been scheduled within the next two months. 
</P>
<P>
 The first forum, a brunch, will be hosted by the renters group Concern for 
Tenants Rights at 11 a.m. Sunday at the Roxbury Park auditorium, 471 S. Roxbury 
Drive. Forums are also planned in March by the League of Women Voters and the 
Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 First-time candidates are: Alan Robert Block, 47, an attorney; Les Bronte, 58, 
former Chamber of Commerce president, and MeraLee Goldman, a former planning 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-time candidates are Mary Levin Cutler, 60, a community activist; Bernie 
Hecht, a former councilman who lost his bid for reelection in 1992; Trisha 
Roth, 48, a pediatrician and community health advocate, and Herm Shultz, 71, a 
community activist who is president of Concern for Tenants Rights of Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>

CITY HALL ROUNDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 BEVERLY HILLS: City officials decided this week to move up plans to demolish 
and replace the aging Coldwater Reservoir, which was slightly damaged in last 
month's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Although water quality has not been affected by the quake-related cracks in 
the concrete, the temblor "made us aware of the fact that we need to go forward 
full speed ahead" with the project, city engineer Dave Gustavson said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1927, the underground 7.7-million-gallon reservoir on Beverly Drive 
is one of 10 water storage facilities owned by the city. The Coldwater facility 
serves the civic center and business district. The City Council on Tuesday 
decided to close the two-acre portion of Coldwater Canyon Park above the 
reservoir due to the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 A running track will be taken out of service, but picnic and other facilities 
at the 5 1/2-acre park will remain open, park officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city hopes to begin work on the $6.5-million reservoir project this 
summer, Gustavson said. The city will first build a 2.4-million gallon 
supplemental reservoir on nearby city property on Woodland Drive, and then 
begin demolition work on the Coldwater Reservoir early next year, he said. 
Water delivery to the business district and civic center will not be affected 
during construction, which is expected to take about three years.

WESTSIDE / COVER STORY; IT'S A DOWN TIME FOR UPSCALE RESTAURANTS. SOME HAVE CUT 
PRICES AND ALTERED THEIR MENUS, WHILE OTHERS HAVE CALLED IT QUITS. THE 
INDULGENT '80S ARE HISTORY. FOR MANY, THE MOOD HAS CHANGED FROM . . .; FEAST TO 
FAMINE

 Eric Stapelman, a partner in the recently defunct Luma restaurant on Montana 
Avenue, is in rescue mode. He's just returned to earthquake-ravaged Los Angeles 
and is rushing to meet someone who plans to open a restaurant in the Beverly 
Center area. The would-be restaurateur wants Stapelman's advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to discourage him," declared Stapelman, whose politically correct 
Santa Monica restaurant -- no meat, no sugar, no smoking -- survived 14 months 
of economic hard times before going under in December. "I'm going to tell him 
he's out of his mind." 
</P>
<P>
 At nearby Santa Monica Place, meanwhile, the lunchtime crowd throngs 
Rockenroll, a sandwich stand quite unlike chef Hans Rockenwagner's other 
creations: the critically acclaimed Rockenwagner and the California-Italian 
Fama, both in Santa Monica, and upscale ROX in West Los Angeles. At Rockenroll, 
for the price of an appetizer, even underpaid office workers can bite into 
Rockenwagner's gourmet cuisine. A smoked-chicken and grilled-eggplant sandwich 
on roasted onion bread costs $5.25. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nineties restaurants try to be as lean as possible," lamented Rockenwagner. 
"What we restaurateurs have to do is become more diverse in what we offer." 
</P>
<P>
 In a wrenching turnaround from a mere few years ago, the trend-setting 
Westside restaurants that delivered Los Angeles to culinary prominence -- and 
then preeminence -- among the nation's cities are taking a major battering. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, many of last decade's playgrounds for upwardly mobile and 
expense-accounted Angelenos are closing, dropping prices, scaling down menus or 
barely hanging on. Last year, once-trendy spots such as Bice, Angeli Rodeo, and 
Matrix all fell victim to the ice-cold economy, as diners turned away from the 
imaginative, yet exorbitantly priced dishes that characterized the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the operative word among L.A. diners is "value." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Michael McCarty, owner of Michael's, the Santa Monica restaurant 
specializing in California cuisine that typified L.A.'s high-flying dining 
experience: "No one I know is remotely doing the business they used to." 
</P>
<P>
 Concurred Stapelman: "I call L.A. 'the menu for disaster.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In a move typical of many Westside restaurants that now offer discounts and 
early-bird specials, the popular California Pizza Kitchen chain last week 
announced that its Brentwood location will begin serving a $6 mini pizza/pasta 
lunch combination. Both Rebecca's and Chaya Venice now offer happy hours. And 
Rockenroll, said Rockenwagner, is a frank attempt to respond to the flat 
market. "Our profit margins have shrunk to next to nothing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The downscaling can be witnessed in the 1994 Zagat Survey of the nation's 
restaurants. Released in December, the annual survey found that the average 
cost of dining out decreased 12% in Los Angeles, from $27.10 to $23.76 per 
person, the sharpest drop of any of the 10 major cities surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Zagat found that from 1991 to 1993, the average cost of a meal at 
surveyed restaurants in Los Angeles dipped nearly 15%, while the average cost 
of a meal at the city's 20 most expensive restaurants fell more than 11%. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Zagat editor Merrill Shindler said the results, while bad for 
restaurateurs, are a boon to diners. "We're still eating quite well; we're just 
paying less," he said. "You're getting high-end restaurants at fairly 
reasonable prices." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurateurs not only are reducing prices, but are seeking to expand their 
customer base. At Michael's, McCarty, has been cutting prices for the last 
several years. In 1989, McCarty dropped prices at Michael's and at his 
restaurants in Denver, Detroit and Washington by 30%. Two years later, at 
Michael's, he introduced a three-course prix fixe that at $16.50 for lunch and 
$26.50 for dinner has been termed "the best bargain in town" by one restaurant 
critic. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, McCarty expanded Michael's menu to include selections of beef, 
veal and lamb chops and lobster for prices about 20% cheaper than might be 
expected at a chophouse. A similar addition to the menu at his Manhattan 
restaurant boosted business there by 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if the message of such downscaling is that Angelenos will never eat 
lunch in this town again for $40 per person, there are plenty of diners taking 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Janie Hewson of Venice says that her favorite restaurants now either offer 
coupons or have substantially cut their prices. At one recent lunch at 
Gilliland's in Santa Monica, Hewson had a "spa-type" lunch complete with a 
Caesar salad made without oil, fresh bread and tea for $12. "They've definitely 
brought their prices in line," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the more diner-friendly times, however, some are troubled by the 
effect the recession has had on the culinary reputation of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Though few critics and gourmets took the city's cuisine seriously a dozen 
years ago, Los Angeles vaulted to prominence during the 1980s, with the 
emphasis on gourmet dining fueled by the region's booming economy. Such 
Westside restaurants as Michael's and Wolfgang Puck's Spago in West Hollywood 
and Chinois on Main in Santa Monica were on the cutting edge of the nation's 
cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the city's reputation as a spectacularly innovative restaurant town, 
confirmed in 1990 by Money magazine when it named Los Angeles the "Best Eating 
City in America," has gone south with the economy. Last year, Money ranked Los 
Angeles third behind New York and San Francisco, a result of the recession that 
"not only killed some of the area's brightest restaurant start-ups but knocked 
the daring out of the chefs who remained." 
</P>
<P>
 "When a city comes along so quickly, almost out of nowhere, money has to be an 
important part of the equation," said senior editor Joseph S. Coyle, author of 
the magazine's last two restaurant surveys. "When I first went there in the 
'60s, San Francisco was wonderful and Los Angeles was nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in today's economic climate, say some food critics and restaurateurs, 
chefs are reluctant to challenge diners with unfamiliar fare. "There's less of 
an inclination to be cutting-edge, to lead the customers to new things," said 
Richard Martin, West Coast bureau chief of the trade journal Nation's 
Restaurant News. "We're seeing greater value and less provocative dishes." 
</P>
<P>
 Rockenwagner agreed: "I have great concerns that this town's restaurants have 
moved a little toward mediocrity. We definitely have had a setback when it 
comes to creativity." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not all agree that the economy has killed innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging the slowing effects of the recession, some critics and 
restaurateurs say that the city's cuisine has simply settled down into a 
bedrock of unique yet dependable cuisine. "People don't necessarily want 
eccentricity," Shindler said. "After all, you get tired of doing silly things. 
And our tried and true is still radically different from anything else out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Some restaurateurs have resisted scaling back, either in price or innovation. 
Take Puck, the restaurateur who is credited with putting the city on the 
nation's culinary map. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he now operates a string of Wolfgang Puck Cafes and Wolfgang Puck 
Expresses, including one recently opened in the Santa Monica Promenade, the 
Austrian-born chef says plans for such low-key establishments were made a 
decade ago. Today, Puck says, he intends to provide more, not less, at his 
upscale Westside restaurants: Chinois on Main, Granita and Spago. 
</P>
<P>
 "To compromise is not the answer," said Puck, who remodeled Spago last year to 
provide a better atmosphere and replaced the stainless steel cutlery at Chinois 
on Main with silverware. "In our business, you have to give people the 
exceptional . . . and in a recession, you have to give people even more of a 
reason to go out. They should have the ultimate experience at the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "People come to our restaurants for something special," he added. "People are 
not going to think of L.A. as a food city in New York or Dallas if we grill a 
steak like everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Offering more of what L.A.'s chefs do best, say Puck and others, is the 
antidote to recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Puck says there's still a healthy demand for tables at his three Westside 
restaurants (a fourth, Eureka, went under last year because of the exorbitant 
cost of running the restaurant's microbrewery). 
</P>
<P>
 "In a big city, there are still enough people to enjoy quality food," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, at Matsuhisa, the restaurant's food and reputation has been enough 
to keep the reservation book full. Though chef Nobu Matsuhisa acknowledged that 
business has been slow lately, which he attributes to the recession and the 
recent earthquake, weekday evenings are still jammed with patrons diving into 
the restaurant's Japanese cuisine, such as baby squid in sea urchin sauce or 
tiger shrimp in hollandaise. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Coyle of Money magazine acknowledges that he'd rather eat at Chinois on 
Main than at any other restaurant, and that there's "no place in the world" 
like Matsuhisa. 
</P>
<P>
 Such tidings, however, mean little to the many Westside restaurateurs who 
continue to take a dour view of the future. This year, they say, is shaping up 
to be another one they simply hope to ride out. 
</P>
<P>
 "In New York, we're doing phenomenal," said Stapelman, comparing his defunct 
Santa Monica restaurant with a similar one on 9th Avenue in Manhattan. "Lines 
(are) out the door; it's sensational. I'm not opening another business in 
California until the economy changes." Cheaper Meals 
</P>
<P>
 In a survey of dining costs in nine major U.S. cities, all showed a decline in 
the average price per meal. Los Angeles' drop was the largest: 04,18,08,08,08 
CITY 1991 1993 CHANGE Los Angeles $27.91 $23.76 -14.9% Houston $15.91 $13.67

OUT AND ABOUT / KELBO'S: A POLYNESIAN GETAWAY

<P>
 It's not Tahiti, but the drinks are tropical, thatched huts abound and neon 
blowfish swim on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad, considering that this funky restaurant and bar is in West Los 
Angeles. In fact, Kelbo's, on Pico Boulevard just west of the San Diego 
Freeway, has been a fixture for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelbo's -- a shrine to the South Pacific -- is a good place to escape L.A.'s 
earthquake troubles. An old deep-sea diving suit welcomes you at the entryway. 
Nautical lighting fixtures illuminate the tables. Shells and old bottles hang 
from the rafters.  
</P>
<P>
 At the bar, customers sit under a bamboo overhang and sip liquor and 
fruit-juice drinks bearing such names as Skull & Bones, Hurricane Marj, Scarlet 
Surf and the infamous Coco Bowl. The menu is not extensive, but Kelbo's is 
known for its Hawaiian-style spareribs. The ribs are marinated for more than 10 
days and cooked in a wood-chip smoke oven. After dinner, slip into the Coco 
Bowl, a disco that spins everything from jazz to hip-hop, funk and music from 
the '40s. On weekends, bands play in a room to the right of the bar. There is 
no cover charge if you show up before 9 p.m. The charge is $7 if you arrive 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelbo's opened its doors in 1947. The name is derived from the last names of 
the two San Pedro ship welders who founded the place: Tom Kelly and Jack Bouck. 
It is still family owned. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place has been around forever," said Venice resident Brett Vadset, who 
considers himself a regular. "It's really comfortable and that's why I always 
come here." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelbo's is at 11434 Pico Blvd. (310) 473-3050. Hours are 4 p.m. to 2 a.m. 
Thursday through Sunday. Dinner is served until 10:30 p.m. on Thursday and 
Sunday, and 11:30 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. CHRISTINA V. GODBEY

REGIONAL REPORT: INGLEWOOD; $25,000 REWARD FOR ARREST IN GANG SLAYINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA RICHARDSON and GORDON DILLOW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Inglewood City Council has posted a $25,000 reward for the killers 
responsible for two nights of unprecedented gang violence last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven people were gunned down and five of them, including a 2-year-old girl 
and a 14-year-old cheerleader, were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The council made the $25,000 reward payable for an arrest, not necessarily a 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we've seen with even the Menendez case, a conviction isn't guaranteed even 
when the people confess to doing it," said Councilman Garland Hardeman, 
referring to hung juries in the trials of Erik and Lyle Menendez, who killed 
their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Inglewood police announced that a 16-year-old Los Angeles youth was 
arrested Monday and was expected to be charged with murder in the death of the 
cheerleader, Tila Lashay French. Police said they withheld announcing the 
arrest until Wednesday to avoid tipping off other suspects who are still wanted 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In last week's rampage, all the dead and four of the wounded were hit in what 
police believe were gang-related shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 The first to be killed was Kyiara Nicole Morrow-Jackson, 2, who was shot while 
her mother, Gina Morrow, 23, was standing in front of their home on West 78th 
Street, talking to a male friend shortly before 7 p.m. Jan. 26. Three men drove 
up and, according to police, might have thought Morrow's friend was a rival 
gang member. They got out of the car and opened fire with 9-millimeter 
semiautomatic pistols, wounding Morrow in the thigh and hitting her daughter in 
the chest. The young girl died later at a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 French was the second victim. She was shot about 7:30 p.m. while she stood 
with a group of friends in the 800 block of North Eucalyptus Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The next victims were three 21-year-old men sitting in a parked car on North 
Market Street shortly before 8:30 p.m. Thursday. Two or three men armed with 
assault rifles got out of a dark-colored small car and riddled the men's car 
with dozens of bullets. Garland E. Money, Sean Omar Williams and Kenneth Darryl 
Cannon were killed. LISA RICHARDSON and GORDON DILLOW

REGIONAL REPORT: CENTRAL CITY; PIECES OF HISTORY AMONG THE CASUALTIES OF QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pieces of the city's history were among the casualties of the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake as dozens of landmark buildings were reported damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary list compiled by the city's Cultural Affairs Department soon 
after the quake found at least 30 such structures were affected, with the 
damage ranging from a fallen sandstone facade at the Ecung-Ibbetson house on 
West Adams Boulevard to minor plaster cracks at the Auto Club of Southern 
California on South Figueroa Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Childs, chairman of the Adams-Dockweiler Historic Organizing Committee, 
estimated as many as 36 homes in that area were damaged by the 6.6 quake and 
subsequent aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The damages to historical monuments is large," said Childs, whose home 
sustained only minor damage. "The larger institutions, such as the Auto Club, 
had minimal damage and they have the resources to deal with it. But the 
individual homeowners had a lot of damage, and there is no program to help 
people with historical homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the hardest hit was the Ezra Stimson House at 2421 S. Figueroa St., 
where the roof was severely damaged. The chimney, parapets and tower were also 
damaged, said Sister Mary Allen of the Sister of St. Joseph of Carondelet, the 
order that moved into the house last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Masonic Temple at 4126 S. Figueroa St. was deemed unsafe by city 
inspectors. The 70-year-old brick-and-tile building, with elegant blue arches, 
was cracked throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Watts Towers Art Center, a large wall mural was severely damaged, but 
the towers survived without critical damage. SANDRA HERNANDEZ

REGIONAL REPORT: SAN PEDRO; KOREAN WAR MONUMENT CLEARS HURDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAMANTHA DUNN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than seven years of sometimes nasty debate, the Korean War Veterans 
Memorial Committee has cleared one of the last remaining hurdles to creating a 
monument in San Pedro to veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent public hearing, William E. Lillenberg, associate zoning 
administrator for the city, ordered a few minor changes in the city's 
application for the memorial on four acres in Angels Gate Park, and said the 
paperwork is finally ready to submit to the state Coastal Commission for 
approval.  
</P>
<P>
 "The nit-picking is over with," said Rick Seward, past president of the 
memorial committee. "There are men in this room with scars on their hearts and 
scars on their bodies who deserve this memorial." 
</P>
<P>
 The memorial was first approved by the parks commission in 1987, but criticism 
from the community brought considerable changes to its first configuration, 
which had huge bronze soldiers aiming guns at the enemy. Neighbors said the 
monument was too big and the image too violent. 
</P>
<P>
 They also complained that it was inappropriate to have such a statue near the 
Korean Friendship Bell, a symbol of goodwill given to the city by the people of 
South Korea. And 30-foot lighting would be a garish intrusion on the ocean 
vista, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a compromise, the monument will comprise life-sized statues of men and one 
woman in the lull of battle and will be placed on a site between two World War 
I batteries near the Ft. McArthur Military Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Parks Department will add ground-level security lighting and consider 
changing the landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 The memorial committee still needs a city building permit before getting the 
final OK on the project. That approval could come in March or April, said John 
Elliott, the committee's administrative services director. After that, four 
months are needed to construct the monument, he said. SAMANTHA DUNN

EDMISTON: PALISADES RESIDENT SPEAKS OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your (Jan. 13) article about and extolling Joe Edmiston was sickening. Have 
you ever heard what he has done to us here in the Pacific Palisades? Let me 
give you a few examples. 
</P>
<P>
 1. There was a beautiful parcel of property on Sunset Boulevard across from 
Palisades High School that was originally designated to be a junior high 
school. It would have made a wonderful park and needed play field for our 
children. This great conservationist has turned it into a paved parking lot -- 
a place to help concentrate further traffic jams and increase car pollution in 
our area. It is true that those who pay to park there have easier access to get 
to the canyon where they must now pay to hike. Sort of takes away the joys of 
nature, doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 2. He attempted to take in Marquez Canyon and wanted to sell it to private 
owners to pay for Fryman Canyon, which is so far away from us that no one in 
Pacific Palisades would have any benefits from it except to lose the privacy we 
now enjoy. It is an ideal area for a pocket park that would give our local 
neighbors a green place where the children could play and have easy access from 
our homes. We do need a spot so that our children can remember the color green. 
</P>
<P>
 3. He wanted to sell the land in Los Liones Canyon (big setback for Joe) to 
private parties. Had this happened he would have removed a natural gateway to 
the Santa Monica Mountains and deprived us again of a God-given resource that 
is rightfully ours. We all bought homes in Pacific Palisades for its natural 
beauty. 
</P>

 Thanks for your report on Upward Bound House (Jan. 13). I had no idea of First 
United Methodist Church's plans to build, among other things, a 500-plus 
parking structure in my area, a residential neighborhood. I submit the 
following in response.

EARTHQUAKE: CRITICISM OF SANTA MONICA TENANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is truly sickening to read newspaper reports that some Santa Monica tenants 
have been so quick to demand rent decreases from "landlords who don't repair 
quake-damaged apartments" (after only two days!). 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, this behavior is opportunistic and smacks of price gouging 
in reverse. It is especially sad considering how many families have been left 
homeless and shattered by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 This disaster has brought out the best qualities of so many Los Angeles 
residents, and the worst of some of Santa Monica's rent-controlled tenants.

TRAFFIC: APPEAL FOR BEVERLY HILLS TO CHIP IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that travel through the Westside has been further complicated by the loss 
of a portion of the Santa Monica Freeway for the next six months or more, it is 
to be hoped that the city of Beverly Hills will do its part by making transit 
easier on Santa Monica and, especially, Olympic boulevards. There is a traffic 
signal at practically every intersection, so poorly timed as to create a 
ridiculous stop-and-go situation even at 3 a.m.! At least between 6 a.m. and 8 
p.m., the lights at minor cross streets should be taken out of service.And at 
other times, if possible, the lights should be set up so that they turn red 
only if a car tries to cross the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 I know the citizens of Beverly Hills prefer us mere peons going around their 
city, but in circumstances under which everyone in Southern California is being 
asked to make little sacrifices, shouldn't they do their share?

 PROUD COACH 
</P>
<P>
 Although most people were rooting for a team -- either the Dallas Cowboys or 
the Buffalo Bills -- during Sunday's Super Bowl, Westchester High Coach Larry 
Wein cheered for a player -- former Comet and Dallas Cowboy linebacker Ken 
Norton Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 If it weren't for Wein, Norton may never have played football. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was entering his second season as Comet coach, Wein went searching for 
players and came across the then 6-foot-2, 220-pound Norton, who was running 
track and playing basketball and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at this guy and I knew that he was a warrior," Wein said. "One sport 
he should be playing and he's not playing it. I went over and talked to him and 
asked that his father give me a call." 
</P>
<P>
 Norton, the son of the former heavyweight boxing champion, was told by his 
father that he could not play football. After hearing his son's pleas, the 
elder Norton called Wein. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just told my wife that I met a player who would make a great tight end," 
Wein said. "That night the father called and said Kenny is really enthusiastic 
about playing football. He asked me 'Coach Wein. What position do you think he 
would be good at? I think he would be a good running back.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he might be a good running back too," Wein responded. "If he said 
'nose guard' I would have agreed to that too. It didn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Norton started two seasons at fullback and linebacker at Westchester before he 
attended UCLA. In 1988, he was drafted in the second round by the Cowboys. 
RECRUITING BLUES 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester quarterback Seka Edwards, the two-time Times' Westside offensive 
back of the year, has yet to receive a scholarship offer from a Division I 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-1, 170-pound Edwards passed for 2,053 yards and 28 touchdowns last 
season to help the Comets reach the City Section 4-A Division semifinals. He 
passed for 3,599 yards and 52 touchdowns in the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few schools have shown interest, but they have backed off," Wein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wein has called college recruiters in an attempt to get a tryout for Edwards. 
USC assistant Charles White was enthusiastic about Edwards in December, but the 
Trojans never called again. Edwards also took a trip to Missouri but did not 
receive an offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Wein cannot figure it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can I tell you?" Wein said. "It's frustrating. He certainly has the 
talent, grades and the character to be an outstanding player." 
</P>
<P>
 But scouts appear to be concerned over Edwards' lack of size. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called Cal and the coaches told me that they don't look at quarterbacks 
unless they are 6-4 or taller," Wein said. "I told them, 'I guess (San 
Francisco 6-2 quarterback) Steve Young wouldn't play for you.' " MILESTONE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 Crossroads girls' basketball Coach Larry Wiener needs three more victories to 
reach 200 for his career. He may get it by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 In 12 seasons as Crossroads coach, Wiener is 197-67. The Roadrunners, last 
season's Delphic League co-champions, play six games in two weeks, including 
games this week against Brentwood, Faith Baptist and Campbell Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-week layoff, the Roadrunners (12-3), rated No. 3 among area teams, 
struggled on Friday to defeat Holy Martyrs, 42-36. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to regain our sharpness we had during Christmas," Wiener said. "We 
need to raise our intensity level. We need to start playing together instead of 
having five superior individuals not working as one unit." THE REMATCH 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, the St. Bernard girls' basketball team lost consecutive 
Mission League games to Bishop Montgomery and Alemany. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings can avenge those loses this week. They played at Alemany on 
Tuesday and play host to Bishop Montgomery today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to avoid making turnovers," St. Bernard Coach Lori Pawinski said. "We 
must have made 35 in each of those games." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings should be helped by the return of 6-4 forward Marte Alexander, who 
suffered an ankle injury against Alemany and did not play against Bishop 
Montgomery. Alexander and 6-2 forward Olympia Scott are each averaging 16.3 
points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll probably try and do the same thing against them," Pawinski said. "We'll 
go inside and try and switch up the defenses a bit." BIG TURNAROUND 
</P>
<P>
 After a 3-11 nonconference record, St. Monica has rebounded to go 5-1 in 
Camino Real League play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners have three players scoring in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Herman Schultz leads the team with a 14.3 average. Gabe Pagtama, who has 
recovered from a broken bone in his foot, is averaging 13.9, and Tyler Murphy 
has improved to 11.9. BIG LETDOWN 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills had a six-point lead with about six minutes remaining in the 
fourth quarter of Friday's game against Mira Costa. A victory would have moved 
the Normans into a tie with the Mustangs for the Ocean League lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mira Costa held the Normans scoreless and won, 52-45, at Beverly Hills. 
Mira Costa is 5-0 in league play. The Normans are 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a 45-39 lead and didn't score from then on," Beverly Hills Coach Jason 
Newman said. "Mira Costa just outplayed us at the end. They were tougher, 
forced the action and took it away from us." 
</P>
<P>
 Norman center Luke Buffum, who averages more than 20 points a game, scored 
only 10. He played most of the game in foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss snapped a four-game winning streak for Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 25, the Normans overcame a 21-13 first quarter deficit to beat 
Redondo, 73-72. Buffum, The Times' 1993 Westside Player of the Year, had 33 
points in the game. BUNDLE OF JOY 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City Coach Jeff Perry and his wife, Jackie, celebrated the birth of 
their first child, Jazmin, on Jan. 18 at 10:40 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's an earthquake baby," said Perry, who has been kept awake taking care of 
his new child. "The night feedings started Friday (Jan. 21). On top of losing 
our game to Beverly Hills, I was up three times taking care of her." 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City snapped a four-game losing streak with an 80-66 win over Ocean 
League rival Morningside on Friday despite playing without leading scorer Louis 
Baity. 
</P>
<P>
 Baity missed the game because of the flu. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centaurs (9-10, 2-3 in league) played two games on the road this week 
against Redondo Tuesday and Morningside on Friday. DOING IT ALL 
</P>
<P>
 Windward freshman guard Kearney Visser nearly had a quadruple-double in the 
Wildcats' 44-39 overtime win Jan. 12 against Yeshiva. Visser had 23 points, 16 
rebounds, 13 steals and eight blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Visser is leading the team in scoring with an average of 10.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's been our bright spot in a difficult season," Windward Coach Andy 
Bernstein said. SEAN WATERS

 FLIGHT FOR RIGHTS: Anaheim pilot Henry Le will lend a bit of spectacle to 
opening ceremonies Saturday for the weekend Tet celebration at Golden West 
College (OC Live!). He'll lead a formation of four smoke-trailing planes. 
Another plane will fly a banner over the festival touting human rights for 
Vietnam. Le says it's important to not forget "the condition of the people over 
there. We've got to look to the future of the country."

 BACK TO SCHOOL: County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez will add to his busy 
schedule this spring. He'll return to his alma mater, Chapman University in 
Orange, to teach an undergraduate political science class. Vasquez said his 
experiences in politics have given him a hefty amount of material for the 
course, called "Governing the Golden State." . . . Says Vasquez: "I took 
political science classes there, and now I have a unique opportunity to return 
and teach. This is a full circle."

 HIGH HOPES: The movie version of "Hideaway," Dean Koontz's 1992 suspense 
thriller, goes into production later this month with Jeff Goldblum in the lead 
role (E1). The best-selling Newport Beach author hasn't been too happy with the 
movie versions of five of his previous books. But with an actor of Goldblum's 
stature aboard, Koontz says, he's "allowing myself to be excited" about 
"Hideaway." . . . "I think there's a damn good chance this will be something I 
don't have to apologize for," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 IDENTITY CRISIS? Some folks who live on Alvarado Place in Newport Beach are 
getting tired of their mail -- and their pizzas -- heading instead to nearby 
Alvarado Street. So they've asked the city to change the name of one-block 
Alvarado Street to Viva Way. . . . Problem is, one resident prefers that it be 
Bonita Place. And one councilwoman suggests Plummer Way, after former 
Councilwoman Ruthelyn Plummer. Council members won't decide until Feb. 14: They 
want to know what the people on Alvarado Street have to say.

 CHIEF FAN: You know things are going pretty well when the President of the 
United States wants to meet you. That's what happened when President Clinton 
was introduced to mystery writer Michael Connelly, an ex-Times Valley Edition 
reporter, during a December trip to Los Angeles. Then, on Wednesday, Clinton 
was given a galley proof of Connelly's next book, "The Concrete Blonde," at a 
Washington bookstore. "I was so nervous," Connelly said about their meeting. "I 
couldn't remember a lot of what we talked about." 
</P>
<P>
 TRIBUTE: Adam Slotnick died in the earthquake, but his co-workers haven't 
forgotten him. On Wednesday, they reopened the store he managed, Pizzeria Uno. 
It's the first shop in the Northridge Fashion Center to open since the quake. 
"It's not the money," one employee said. "It's what Adam would want." (B1) 
</P>
<P>
 DECISION DAY: Not long ago, the most challenging task of every pet's day was 
fetching sticks or taking afternoon naps -- tough life. Then came the 
earthquake, and hundreds of terrified animals escaped into the darkness. On 
Wednesday, many pets at the West Valley Animal Shelter, above, faced the 
possibility of being killed if not reclaimed by their former owners or adopted 
by new ones. (B1) 
</P>
<P>
 NOTHIN' SHAKIN': There's Norman Bates and his mother, and Jaws terrifying the 
swimmers. But still no earthquake ride at Universal Studios. It's been shut 
down since the real thing hit Jan. 17. . . . "It doesn't seem right," public 
relations director Jim Yeager said. "There are a lot of people homeless. If we 
go a week or two without shocks, we'll see. It's a day-to-day decision." 
</P>
<P>
 TAKE ME OUT: Sick of Jimmy Johnson and his ego? Burned out on Skategate? Well, 
sports fans, you can escape: Baseball is back. The junior college variety, that 
is. Valley teams will start playing this weekend at tournaments throughout the 
state. . . . Once again, the conferences have altered their alignment. (C8)

PIERRE BOULLE; WROTE 'RIVER KWAI,' 'PLANET OF THE APES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pierre Boulle, the French author of the best-selling novels "Bridge on the 
River Kwai" and "Planet of the Apes," which were turned into popular films, has 
died in Paris. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
 Boulle, an engineer with no literary training who began writing in middle age, 
died Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The highly successful 1957 film "Bridge on the River Kwai," starring William 
Holden and Sir Alec Guinness, won the Academy Award for best picture in 1958 
and five other Oscars, including best screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 Boulle accepted the writer's Oscar at the 1958 ceremony, but it was an open 
secret that he had not written the screenplay based on his 1952 novel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knew Boulle couldn't speak English, let alone write it," Hollywood 
historian Larry Ceplair told The Times years later. 
</P>
<P>
 The screen version was actually written by a "Michael Wilson," a false name 
for the blacklisted writer Carl Foreman. In 1985, the Academy of Motion Picture 
Arts and Sciences posthumously awarded Foreman an Oscar for the screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 Boulle, a native of Avignon, France, studied science and engineering at the 
Ecole Superieur d'Electricite, worked briefly as an engineer in France and 
moved to Malaya as a rubber planter. 
</P>
<P>
 His heroism during World War II provided ample material when he turned to 
writing in 1949. It also won him the French Legion of Honor, the Croix de 
Guerre and the Medal of the Resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Boulle joined the French Resistance in Malaya and the French Army in what was 
then Indochina, becoming a secret agent known as Peter John Rule, 
Mauritius-born Englishman. 
</P>
<P>
 He fought in Burma, China and Indochina before he was taken prisoner by the 
Japanese. He escaped in 1944 and returned to France until the end of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "Le Pont de la riviere Kwai," his third novel, involved Allied prisoners of 
the Japanese building a bridge in Burma for their captors. 
</P>
<P>
 Boulle wrote in French, but his work was translated into English and 
distributed around the world.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; COUNCIL PANEL BACKS BID TO RAZE PEIRANO 
BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying that needed seismic reinforcements would be too costly, a Ventura City 
Council subcommittee Wednesday recommended a developer's proposal to tear down 
the historic Peirano grocery store to reveal an 18th-Century Spanish laundry 
under its foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation dealt a serious blow to local history and art leaders who 
want to save the 117-year-old landmark across from San Buenaventura Mission and 
convert it into a municipal art gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-member subcommittee threw its support behind a proposal by Ventura 
Realty Co. to buy the Peirano building from the city and demolish it to show 
off a lavanderia that may have been used by Spanish missionaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Realty wants to raze the structure, then rebuild the facade of the 
Peirano building on Main Street. Under the proposal, the lavanderia would be 
the main focus of a courtyard surrounded by a restaurant, shops and offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Peirano building is designated a state landmark, the city can 
allow its demolition as long as a series of federal and state environmental 
reviews are conducted, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the building is not sold to Ventura Realty, the city could tear it down. 
Otherwise, the city would have to reinforce the structure at 204 E. Main St. 
and make other seismic repairs before leasing it to tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders have balked at the estimated $430,000 cost to repair the old 
brick grocery store, which is boarded up and vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to ask ourselves some pretty hard, cold questions," Councilwoman Rosa 
Lee Measures said. "At what point, at what cost, do we do historic 
preservation?" 
</P>
<P>
 Following last month's 6.6-magnitude earthquake, city officials said the 
unreinforced masonry building suffered some cracks in its walls, and some 
plaster is ready to collapse. No one is allowed to enter the building without a 
hard hat, Associate City Planner Monica Nolan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Realty's proposal to take the Peirano building off the city's hands is 
a tempting one for Ventura officials, who have been unsuccessful in leasing the 
building since 1987 because of the high costs to make it satisfy earthquake 
safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Discovery of the lavanderia under the building has further complicated its 
future. The lavanderia , a large pool that may have been used for the mission's 
laundry, is only one of seven discovered in the state. City officials unearthed 
it in September, 1991, when they were planning to replace part of the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Wood, president of Ventura Realty, said the lavanderia has a greater 
historical significance than Peirano's grocery store and would be highlighted 
in his proposed development. Wood said he would like to keep the Peirano 
building, but it would be too costly to upgrade. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a compromise, Wood met with historical and art leaders Wednesday to 
discuss the possibility of carving out space in his proposed development for a 
municipal art gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 History and art leaders want to keep both the building and showcase the 
lavanderia as part of the proposed art gallery. They argue that the city has an 
obligation to preserve the Peirano building, the oldest brick structure in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan submitted by the Ventura Artists' Union, art shows would be 
held at the Peirano building year-round, and the gallery would be rented out to 
groups for special events. The group is offering to operate the gallery for the 
city for free, and is asking that the city pay for restoration costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money is there if the City Council wanted to preserve it," Ventura artist 
Richard Peterson said. "It's obviously not a priority for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Miriam Mack, the city's former redevelopment director, said a previous council 
had purchased the building in 1987 for $185,000 for historic preservation 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We bought the building because we wanted to ensure that it would be 
rehabilitated correctly," Mack said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the political makeup of the council has changed since then. Most of the 
present council members were elected on pro-business platforms, and the 
three-member subcommittee's view is likely to be adopted by the entire council, 
since only one more vote on the seven-member City Council is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, the Ventura Artists' Union is marshaling for a political 
battle to win over a majority of the council. The 31-member group, made up of 
artists and historic preservation activists, is preparing to write letters of 
support to local newspapers and the council, and hold fund-raisers to help pay 
for the building's rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have 200 people at the council meeting, maybe we can change their 
minds," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the council is scheduled to make a decision on the Peirano 
building by early next month.

SECURITY DEBATED AFTER STABBING; VIOLENCE: FRIENDS OF SIMI STUDENT WHO WAS 
FATALLY ATTACKED SAY THERE ARE MANY WEAPONS ON CAMPUS. OFFICIALS INSIST SCHOOLS 
ARE SAFE.

 As students at Valley View Junior High School in Simi Valley struggled 
Wednesday to cope with their grief at the stabbing death of a ninth-grader, 
school officials and friends of the slain youth disagreed over the need for 
improved security at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of Chad Patrick Hubbard, 14, described Valley View as a potentially 
violent place where many kids carry knives, and they identified the 13-year-old 
suspect in the stabbing as a "tagger" who sought acceptance by emulating gang 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the dispute between the pair began months ago, but escalated 
recently after the 13-year-old stole Chad's baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just started when they looked at each other funny," Jon Henley, 16, said. 
"Then it got worse and worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Supt. Mary Beth Wolford insisted that Simi Valley's schools are safe, as 
more than 20 crisis counselors flocked to the junior high to aid students and 
employees in the wake of the first slaying ever on a Simi Valley school campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simi Valley is the second safest city of its size in the United States," 
Wolford said. "But I would tell parents that does not exclude us from reviewing 
all of our safety precautions carefully." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, school officials have considered building a fence around the 
school and getting more adults to volunteer as campus supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 But school board member Doug Crosse said such measures would not have 
prevented Tuesday's stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think another adult or two supervising on campus would have been able 
to intervene in this case," Crosse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, school administrators considered screening students with metal 
detectors, but police officials dissuaded them, saying such devices were not 
effective in stopping students from bringing weapons to school. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Debbie Sandland said parents and teachers should focus on 
intervening in the lives of students prone to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than treating the symptoms, I think we need to look at it at a much 
earlier age and teach children not to accept violence as a solution to their 
problems," Sandland said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Chad's friends said the slain boy was not involved in any gang and do 
not think gang animosity was a factor in the stabbing, they disputed assertions 
by school officials that violence is not a problem on the Valley View campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fights are going on all the time," said Kelly Cockings, 15, a 10th-grader at 
Simi Valley High School who attended Valley View last year. "A lot of kids 
carry knives; they just haven't used them before this." 
</P>
<P>
 Other students said they would welcome increased security on campus and at the 
nearby Convenient Food Mart store on Township Avenue where fights between 
students often break out. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to fight, you say 'meet me at Convenient,' " Jessica Hammerle, 
15, said. "I think it's time to do something about this, so nobody else gets 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 At school Wednesday, yellow police tape continued to mark off the open air 
hallway near where Chad was stabbed in the heart with a pocketknife by a 
classmate as classes ended Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Principals from area schools gathered at the junior high to help restore calm, 
and police swarmed the campus, interviewing witnesses and comforting weeping 
students, while school officials called parents to inform them of a special 
meeting tonight to discuss school safety. 
</P>
<P>
 School psychologist Pat Madden said he expected that counselors would talk 
with as many as one-fifth of the school's 1,000 students Wednesday. "Students 
may at first feel sadness at the loss of a friend, then they'll get angry that 
we have to lose somebody close to us," Madden said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's confusion also. They say 'What do I do now?' For many, this is their 
first time grieving a loss like this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Police Department also sent four officers from its DARE 
department to comfort Valley View students and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking home from school, eighth-grader Tony Bova, 13, said discussing his 
feelings of sadness and anger with teachers and classmates had not erased his 
fear since the stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't really trust anybody," he said. "If you fight with somebody, you 
don't know if they're going to pull a knife." 
</P>
<P>
 The 13-year-old suspect, who is being held at Juvenile Hall, is expected to be 
charged today, a spokesman for the Ventura County district attorney's office 
said. He will probably appear in court Friday, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he is not yet 16, the suspect cannot be tried as an adult, under 
California law. If found guilty, his maximum punishment would be confinement 
with the California Youth Authority until he reaches age 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County prosecutors said because of the gravity of the case, they were 
sidestepping the normal administrative process to obtain police reports of the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office assigned the case to one of its top homicide 
prosecutors, James D. Ellison. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin J. McGee said prosecutors have 48 hours after 
the arrest of a juvenile to file charges, giving them until 3:30 p.m. today to 
charge the youth suspected of stabbing Chad. 
</P>
<P>
 If charges are filed, a public hearing will be held today or Friday, McGee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley police interviewed several students who witnessed the stabbing, 
but disclosed little about their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my understanding that there was some sort of a confrontation between the 
two boys before the stabbing took place," Simi Valley Police Lt. Dick Thomas 
said. "Who initiated it or how, I just don't have that information." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of the slain youth said the stabbing was the culmination of an ongoing 
dispute between the two boys. They said the long-simmering dispute between the 
two boys heated up last week when the 13-year-old stole Chad's baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ken Miller, an uncle of the slain youth, said arrangements have 
been made for the funeral, scheduled for Saturday at Simi Covenant Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and family members have set up the Chad Hubbard Memorial Fund to help 
pay for the funeral, which is expected to cost more than $6,000. Donations can 
be sent to Valley View Junior High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got kids and neighbors coming over and everybody has just really been 
great," Miller said. "We're all pretty trashed, and it's just starting to sink 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Eichele, pastor of Our Saviour Lutheran Church where Chad was confirmed, 
on Wednesday said he was preparing remarks for the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Eichele said he hoped to ease the devastation felt by mourners by stressing 
that God shared the pain of Chad's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "God did not will that," Eichele said. "But he certainly enters our pain in 
that situation and walks with us, in that he lost his son in a very violent 
death." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said the slain youth's parents, Scott and Jackie Hubbard, spent the day 
talking to friends and looking through old photographs of their son, the eldest 
of their four children. 
</P>
<P>
 They found a poem Chad wrote to his mother several years ago: "You are the 
moon that sits in the sky, as you are the twinkle in my eye. You are the sun 
that sets in the west. You are my mom and you are the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Dwayne Bray and Times correspondents Julie Fields and James 
Maiella Jr. contributed to this story. How to Help Kids Cope 
</P>
<P>
 Children may show a variety of reactions to traumatic incidents such as the 
loss of a classmate, according to psychologist Pat Madden of the Simi Valley 
Unified School District. Here are some of her suggestions for parents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Relax: Do not worry if a child behaves in a highly emotional manner. This is 
a normal reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 * Listen: Let children talk about their feelings as often as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't rush: If a child does not want to talk, wait awhile and then again 
offer a listening ear. " 'I don't want to talk' usually means, 'I want to talk 
but I can't right now,' " Madden said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be flexible: Understand that emotions will ebb and flow. Inconsistency may 
indicate that the child is trying to resolve powerful or conflicting feelings 
in a manageable way, Madden said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be optimistic: Do not let children's overly negative views of the world go 
unchallenged. If a child believes that the world has gone awry and only bad 
things seem to happen, gently point out the good things. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Simi Valley Unified School District are holding a special 
meeting at 7:30 tonight at Sinaloa Junior High School, 601 Royal Ave., to meet 
with parents to discuss school safety. Services for Chad Hubbard will be held 
at 10 a.m. Saturday at Simi Covenant Church, 4680 Alamo St., Simi Valley. It 
will be followed by a graveside service at Assumption Cemetery, 1380 Fitzgerald 
Road, Simi Valley.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; COMMERCE SECRETARY BRINGS AID; FILLMORE: RONALD 
BROWN OFFERS RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES ENCOURAGEMENT. ASSISTANCE FOR SIMI VALLEY 
WILL TAKE LONGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Bringing cash and encouragement, U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown came 
to Fillmore on Wednesday, promising that the federal government will do all it 
can to help businesses and residents in earthquake-ravaged Ventura County 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to about 50 residents and city officials at Fillmore's Central Park, 
Brown expressed confidence in a quick recovery for Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not just about talk," Brown said. "We actually brought some money 
with us," referring to loan checks given to four Fillmore homeowners and one 
business owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Dortha and Raymond Miller, who have lived in Fillmore for 54 years, received 
$5,300 to pay for repairs to their house, which lost part of its roof in the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not have the money to repair the house," Raymond Miller said. "If we 
had not received this check, I have no idea what we would do." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Stewart, owner of the Ballard's Furniture store founded by his grandfather 
57 years ago, received a check for an undisclosed sum to start repairs at his 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I would be doing" without the assistance, Stewart said. "I 
did not know what to expect." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Supervisor Vicky Howard, who had lunch with Brown during his 
visit, said that residents of Fillmore were among the first to receive checks 
from the government because they applied early. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fillmore is such a small community that it is easier to get your arms around 
it and rebuild it in a quick fashion," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 For her Simi Valley district, however, it will take longer for many to get 
financial assistance because many in the community are still assessing the 
damage, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said Brown assured her that the destruction in Simi Valley will not be 
forgotten and that everyone in Ventura County who needs help will get it. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Clinton's instructions," Brown told the Fillmore crowd, "were to do 
everything that we can do, to be as helpful as we can in the economic recovery 
of communities like this all over the state of California." 
</P>
<P>
 His comments came as workers nearby continued to hammer together a 
prefabricated structure in the park where 10 to 12 local businesses will be 
temporarily relocated. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants moving into what Mayor Linda Brewster dubbed the Domed Mini-Mall 
Shopping Pavilion will pay the city $1 a month for the first six months. Then 
the city will reassess the economic situation and may increase the rent. 
</P>
<P>
 And by next Wednesday, the city hopes to have modular buildings installed in a 
city parking lot across from Central Park. The modular facilities will house 
private offices and the town's only health clinic, which has been operating in 
a trailer since the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Roy Payne said the city will do everything it can to prevent 
merchants from leaving town. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are extremely concerned that merchants will move out of town. We are going 
to get those structures ready as soon as possible so they will stay," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was accompanied by James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, and Richard Andrews, director of the Governor's Office of 
Emergency Services. All of them praised residents and city officials for 
working together to rebuild the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a lot to do and a long way to go, but we are doing it quickly," Witt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other quake-related developments, Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) 
introduced legislation to allow earthquake victims to use money from their 
Individual Retirement Accounts without tax penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 And a state agency, the California Coastal Rural Development Corp., opened a 
satellite office in Fillmore to assist small businesses with state-backed loan 
guarantees.

OXNARD REJECTS FIRE-POLICE MERGER; SAFETY: COUNCIL SCRAPS THE STAFF'S PROPOSAL. 
FIREFIGHTERS SAY THEY WILL WORK WITH THE CITY ON OTHER WAYS TO TRIM COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pressured by a boisterous crowd and an unprecedented outpouring of calls and 
letters, the Oxnard City Council has scrapped a money-saving plan to merge the 
city's police and fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, firefighters promised to work with city leaders to find 
alternative ways to trim the department's budget if the city is again forced to 
cut spending. 
</P>
<P>
 With a unanimous vote, the council rejected a staff proposal late Tuesday that 
would have joined the two agencies in a Department of Public Safety and would 
have required firefighters to take low-priority burglary reports during their 
spare time. 
</P>
<P>
 First proposed in June as part of a plan to reduce city bureaucracy to cope 
with budget cuts, the merger was viewed by city officials as a way to combine 
the two departments that concern public safety. City staff had predicted 
savings of $185,000 by combining administration and another $500,000 by having 
firefighters perform some police duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not interested in firefighters carrying guns or police officers 
carrying hoses and ladders, but in doing everything we can to improve public 
safety," City Manager Thomas Frutchey said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the proposal foundered in recent weeks after the Oxnard Firefighters Assn. 
rallied public opinion against the merger. By Tuesday, the city had received 
more than 2,000 postcards and letters opposing the plan and nearly 3,000 phone 
calls, which at times tied up phone lines into City Hall, City Clerk Daniel 
Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The volume of calls and letters dwarfed the public response to other recent 
controversies, including a proposal to build a card club and another to 
restrict pornography, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the city had already backed off from the initial proposal to cross-train 
the city's police officers and firefighters so each could do the others' job, a 
noisy, overflow crowd of 300 at Tuesday's council meeting adamantly opposed any 
consolidation of the two departments. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the stormy meeting, council members who had earlier voiced 
support for some type of merger agreed to keep the departments independent and 
find other ways to save money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe the savings we have been given are sufficient (to merge the 
departments) at this time," said Councilman Michael Plisky, who had drawn heat 
for criticizing the firefighters' campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is to work, it can't be forced on the city by staff or City Council. 
It must be embraced by the community," Plisky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials disputed the city's estimate of the savings that would be 
achieved, saying that the Fire Department had already realized what little 
savings were possible by leaving vacant an assistant fire chief position. 
</P>
<P>
 "Firefighters have (already) taken the budget cuts and program cuts," Oxnard 
Fire Capt. Michael O'Malia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of performing low-priority police functions, O'Malia said firefighters 
want to do other jobs they are specially trained for -- handling hazardous 
materials, urban search and rescue, disaster preparedness and rescues from 
confined spaces. To the extent firefighters have free time, he said, they 
should use it for fire-related education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Fire Capt. Robin Miller, after noting that Oxnard had created a 
combined Public Safety Department in 1986 only to abandon it three years later, 
pledged the department's support in the city's effort to cut spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the chief on down, we are willing to make the commitment to save you 
money," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Manuel Lopez, the council's lone critic of the merger prior to Tuesday's 
tumultuous showdown, suggested that the city could charge a fee for emergency 
medical responses as a way to keep costs in line. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said fire departments often lose out in mergers when the combined 
departments are headed by police administrators, and said a merger is 
unnecessary to save money. "Anything we can do through consolidation, we can do 
with separate departments," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 After listening to four hours of comments from a somewhat unruly audience, 
other council members agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The City Council has been preoccupied with efficiency and cost saving, and 
may have lost our perspective on the human values," Plisky said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; VALLEY EXODUS GIVES ECONOMY A WELCOME JOLT

<P>
 Ever since Jan. 17, business couldn't be better at Bud & Ken Lumber Co. in 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been getting lots of people from Simi, Fillmore, even Agoura," store 
manager Rick Barnes said of the many people flocking to his store to buy 
materials for doing repairs on their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of places were damaged in Simi, and lots of places there are already out 
of material, so we get a lot of (customers) from that area." 
</P>
<P>
 From Oxnard hardware stores supplying lumber to Simi Valley disaster victims 
to Conejo Valley businesses besieged by San Fernando Valley residents, Ventura 
County's commercial sector has benefited dramatically from the worst disaster 
to strike the greater Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is quite a boon," said Steve Rubenstein, president of the Conejo Valley 
Chamber of Commerce. "We're very pleased to help our neighbors to the south." 
</P>
<P>
 The change is particularly noticeable in the commercial rental market, where 
brokers say hardly a large industrial building remains vacant east of Oxnard. 
In the last two weeks alone, businesses looking for temporary or permanent 
working space have gobbled up about 500,000 square feet worth of rental space, 
said Rick Heath, a broker with Grubb & Ellis in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big companies needed to act within a week of the earthquake or they lost 
out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the many companies that have moved westward from the Valley are Vivitar, 
the camera manufacturer, which moved its corporate headquarters Monday from 
Chatsworth to Newbury Park, and computer giant Packard Bell, also formerly of 
Chatsworth, now relocating temporarily in Westlake Village and Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Between all the new workers trying out local businesses on their lunch breaks 
and Valley residents seeking a haven from Los Angeles' persistent aftershocks, 
business is flourishing in the east county, merchants say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been really hectic," said Gary Endicott, manager of the Thousand Oaks' 
Sears, Roebuck & Co. store, which has handled much of the overflow from the 
closed Sears stores in Northridge and Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Local hardware and glass stores say they too are swamped with customers since 
the quake jump-started the ailing construction business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every morning when I drive down the 101 to Oxnard from Thousand Oaks, I'm 
seeing hundreds of glass-carrying trucks heading toward the Valley from as far 
away as Santa Barbara and Goleta," said Dave Gulbranson, owner of Oxnard-based 
Oakstone Glass Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good time to be in the glass business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At The Oaks, shoppers from the Valley, such as Winona Roark of West Hills, 
fill the mall's boutiques and department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not expecting a 5.0 aftershock here like I am out there," Roark, 74, said 
as she searched for an athletics store where she could buy walking shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Roark said she had considered going to one of the malls near her in the West 
Valley, but finally hopped on the Ventura Freeway when she could not figure out 
which stores were open. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew some were open, but we didn't know which ones," she said. "We knew 
they were all open here." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Iovine, another customer at The Oaks, said the earthquake had made a 
Thousand Oaks convert out of her and her husband. The couple moved to Agoura 
four years ago after years living in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever they needed a mall, they headed to Topanga Plaza or the 
now-devastated Northridge Fashion Center. When they wanted to go out to dinner, 
they drove east again, to Calabasas and Woodland Hills. Then the earthquake 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Valley is home, but right now, it doesn't seem like home," said Iovine, 
55. "It gives me the feeling that a war's been through there, and I wanted to 
get out." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two weeks, the Iovines tried at least three new restaurants in 
Thousand Oaks and made extensive shopping trips to The Oaks. They've found that 
they like the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's less crowded out here -- just delightful," she said. "We're saying, 'Why 
didn't we do more of this before?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Iovines are not the only ones with that thought. The residential rental 
market in eastern Ventura County and Camarillo has skyrocketed since the Jan. 
17 temblor, with residents of hard-struck neighborhoods in San Fernando and 
Simi valleys looking for a temporary roof over their heads while their homes 
are rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're filling up fast," said Barbara Beck, operations manager at Hacienda de 
Camarillo Apartments, where about 40 units have been rented since the 
earthquake. "We've been renting to everybody from Northridge all the way to 
Simi Valley, and we're still having people come in today." 
</P>
<P>
 West county real estate agents, particularly those in Oxnard and Ventura, say 
the market has not changed much in the last few weeks. But Thousand Oaks agents 
say they can barely keep up with all the business that the quake dropped in 
their laps. 
</P>
<P>
 "The homes rent faster than they list," said Tricia Onsgard, an agent with 
Brown Realtors in Westlake. "I tell my clients, 'If you see something you like, 
go back to the office now and write an offer because the house may be gone 
before you finish.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some east county hotels too are near full occupancy since the quake left many 
area residents homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 At the 190-room Radisson Hotel in Simi Valley, 70% of the rooms are rented to 
earthquake evacuees, said Scott Cleaveland, the hotel's front office manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been sold out for awhile," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake victims are not only checking into hotels to find shelter, however. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ojai Valley Inn & Country Club, reservation clerks are fielding five 
calls a day from nervous Valley and east county residents looking for a place 
to rest and relax, said Alison Brainard, the inn's marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're finding is people have a bit of fear and panic, and they feel a 
bit calmer out here," she said.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: DEPUTY D.A. TO RETIRE NEXT MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year after receiving a demotion following a disagreement with her boss over 
a police-shooting investigation, Deputy Dist. Atty. Carol J. Nelson has 
announced plans to retire when she turns 50 next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson -- a homicide prosecutor until the February, 1992, controversy with 
Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury -- acknowledged Wednesday that her reassignment 
played a role in the retirement decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a factor, but I can't tell you how much, I really can't," she said. 
"Just as I have a right to my opinion, Mr. Bradbury has a right to his opinion 
. . . and he is the boss." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury had no comment on the issue, but a spokesman for his office said 
Nelson's trial skills will be missed. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's talented, and I think she is looking for a chance to use those talents 
in some other ways now," Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin J. McGee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four and a half months into her investigation of the shooting death of a 
Malibu millionaire, Nelson was pulled from the case, moved to a smaller office 
and reassigned to the less-prestigious sex-crimes unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Her report cleared Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies of wrongdoing in the 
death of rancher Donald P. Scott. A report Bradbury released six weeks later 
concluded that the deputies were on Scott's property illegally in hopes of 
seizing the $5-million property. 
</P>
<P>
 In retirement, Nelson will receive 18% of her yearly $79,221 salary, or 
$14,260 a year, county Personnel Director Ronald Komers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson is engaged to a psychology instructor at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 
where she plans to spend most of her time initially. She also would like to 
teach criminal justice, write for legal journals and handle some appellate 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really not an ambitious person," she said. "I see my job as protecting 
the weak from bullies by using my brain." DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; $250,000 EARMARKED FOR EARTHQUAKE AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lending a hand to Ventura County communities devastated by last month's 
earthquake, the Port Hueneme City Council voted Wednesday to advance $250,000 
in federal grants expected this year to the county's relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The money -- community block grants distributed by the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development -- will be used to provide emergency assistance to areas 
of the county hard hit by the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 While HUD has indicated that it will attempt to replace the funds, Port 
Hueneme officials said they were taking a risk because the city has used the 
grants to pay for services usually funded from city revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Potentially affected by the loss of funds are the city's crossing guards, 
housing rehabilitation, code enforcement, graffiti removal and senior citizen 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 In backing use of the funds for county disaster relief, Councilman Dorill 
Wright said the city was taking a risk that was necessary because of the 
hardship caused by the natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see too high a risk to help the needs of the suffering communities, 
to get damaged businesses back on line and damaged housing repaired," Wright 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said city programs funded by the HUD grants are not essential services.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: PROSECUTOR ACCUSED OF EAVESDROPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County prosecutor has been removed from a burglary case and given a 
new assignment after being accused of ordering a district attorney's 
investigator to eavesdrop on a conversation between the defendant and his 
attorney, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's office is investigating the complaint against Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Stacy A. Ratner, a six-year county prosecutor, district attorney's 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin J. McGee said a court bailiff reported that he 
thought Ratner had ordered the investigator to eavesdrop on the conversation 
between the suspect, Robert Lee Morrow, and Deputy Public Defender Mary L. 
Fielder. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow and Fielder were talking on Jan. 18 in a room that adjoins Courtroom 
No. 44 in the Hall of Justice, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, by Sheriff's Deputy Edward LeClair, was forwarded to Dist. Atty. 
Michael D. Bradbury for investigation. Bradbury asked the attorney general's 
office to look into the matter to avoid a conflict of interest, McGee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hopeful that when the A. G. is done reviewing this, they will be of the 
opinion that there was a misunderstanding or a miscommunication that occurred 
here," McGee said. 
</P>
<P>
 LeClair, Ratner and the investigator, Katherine Smith, declined comment. 
Public Defender Fielder could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 McGee said Morrow, who is being held in Ventura County Jail without bail, is 
accused of breaking into a room at a local hotel while its occupants were 
asleep. He had no other details about the case.  
</P>
<P>
 A jail spokesman said Morrow also faces charges of violating probation and 
multiple drug counts. His next court appearance is scheduled for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratner was responsible for handling the daily criminal calender for the 
prosecutor's office in Courtroom No. 44, which is presided over by Superior 
Court Judge James McNally. She is now doing the same job in Superior Court 
Judge Charles R. McGrath's courtroom. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; 3 MILITARY POLICEMEN DISPUTE CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three Port Hueneme military policemen facing court-martials for allegedly 
apprehending a deserter off base without permission said the charges against 
them have no basis and are a result of the whistle-blowing activities of one of 
the three. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials said Master at Arms George R. Taylor, Spec. 2nd Class Mark A. 
Bassett and Signalman 2nd Class Thomas S. Hinson all are charged with 
dereliction of duty for apprehending Richard V. Miller on Nov. 16, 1992, in 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the three men nor Navy officials would comment on the details of the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 But Taylor's Naval attorney, Lt. Carter Brod, said, "It is our contention that 
everything that was done by Senior Chief Taylor was completely within the 
guidelines of his job." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Wadley, a spokeswoman for the base, said the three, along with federal 
Police Officer Byron J. Frank, did not have the authority to apprehend Miller 
in Oxnard. Frank faces possible discipline pending the outcome of the 
court-martials. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do not have the authority to conduct police business off base unless 
authorized by the commanding officer," she said. "And they must be authorized 
for each specific instance." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, a 16-year veteran of the Navy, said he believes that the charges are a 
direct result of his whistle-blowing activities at a Naval station in Bermuda. 
</P>
<P>
 On a national TV news show in December, 1992, Taylor accused high-ranking Navy 
officials of keeping the base open because they enjoyed using it for vacations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people at the (Port Hueneme military police) know it's nothing more than 
a witch hunt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wadley denied Taylor's assertion. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's absolutely false," she said. "The charges have nothing to do with the 
incident in Bermuda." JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FIRMS ELIGIBLE FOR ENVIRONMENT AWARD

<P>
 The Ventura County Economic Development Assn. is asking business leaders and 
managers to submit entries for its Excellence in Environment Leadership Award, 
an annual honor designed to recognize environmentally sensitive businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 VECEDA, a business lobby and advocacy group, encourages entries from any 
business or organization that works with products or programs to enhance the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3M Co. in Camarillo won the award last year after the company 
significantly reduced its toxic air emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning the award resulted in the kind of positive news coverage that no 
amount of marketing funds could have ever purchased," Jerome Malmquist of 3M 
Co. said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Entries, which must be submitted by March 1, can focus on compliance with 
regulations on air or water quality, reducing hazardous or other waste, 
recycling, and preserving or restoring the environment.

SCOTT HARRIS: LIFE CALMS DOWN TO BEING MERELY EXTRAORDINARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "This time," Judy Horn said, "our dogs alerted us." 
</P>
<P>
 Holly, usually a picture of calm, grew nervous. After the 3.8 aftershock hit 
early Saturday morning, the black Lab forced her way into Judy's room. Soon 
Judy was up feeding biscuits to Holly, Rex and the chronically skittish Butch. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Judy decided to check on her ailing husband. She was at Bob's side when 
the 5.0 aftershock hit at 3:20 a.m., centered just a few miles north of their 
Winnetka home. 
</P>
<P>
 With one hand, Judy held on to Bob. With the other, she held on to his 
mechanical lung. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been more than two weeks since the 6.6 haymaker sent us reeling. True, we 
don't know when the aftershocks will end. But as I took my own secret shortcut 
to work this week, it was good to see that some of the fallen block walls were 
being rebuilt. Slowly, life seems to be returning to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 This also seems true for the Horn family -- and normal for them is 
extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bob is a former Cal State Northridge political science professor who five 
years ago was stricken with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Now virtually 
paralyzed by the disease, Horn survives with the aid of a ventilator -- a 
battery-powered box that feeds air to his windpipe through a plastic tube. 
Although his body has failed him, professor Horn still displays a sharp mind 
and an active wit with the help of a specially rigged computer or the coded 
movements of his eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Jan. 17 quake was frightening for you, imagine what it was like for the 
immobile Bob Horn, whose mechanical lung was pitched to the floor and damaged. 
Imagine what it was like for Judy as she heard the ventilator alarm, signaling 
that Bob wasn't getting any air. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I had time to go into the apprehension and fear," Judy says, 
"because I had so much to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy and Bob, fortunately, weren't alone. Their 22-year-old son, Chris, was at 
home, as was a nursing attendant. So was Judy's 77-year-old mother, Marion, 
who'd shuffled in from the cold of Buffalo, N. Y., for a visit, only to come 
down with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
 The others made it through the quake without harm. They focused their 
attention on Bob. 
</P>
<P>
 First they disconnected Bob's broken "vent" and hooked up a device known as an 
"ambu bag" -- a manually operated device that pumps air into his lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier that week, Bob had developed a bronchial infection that required that 
fluids be suctioned from his throat. With the power knocked out by the 
earthquake, they resorted to a portable, battery-powered suction device. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bob's breathing became so difficult that Judy hooked up the device to an 
oxygen tank. For close to an hour, Chris used the "ambu bag" to keep his father 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris tried to explain his father's ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's helpless all the time," Chris said. "And when you run into something 
like an earthquake, when people who are not sick are helpless, it magnifies his 
helpless feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared. My mom was scared. But that has to be shoved aside to make sure 
he gets through it. . . . It was amazing what my mom was able to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends pitched in as well. A neighbor shut off the gas line. Mario Hernandez, 
a nursing assistant who has been with the Horns for three years, left his own 
damaged apartment in Reseda to check on the Horns. Chris' friend Ben Turner 
also showed up. Together, Chris and Ben were able to lift Bob into his 
wheelchair and place him in the van for a trip to the hospital, Humana West 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Horn has nothing but praise for how the hospital's doctors, nurses and 
attendants reacted to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, 11 days after the 6.6 quake hit, Bob came home from the hospital 
-- just in time for a big aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy says they've learned a few lessons. Now Bob's ventilator is strapped to 
the table by a bungee cord. And his portable ventilator is close at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Horn tends to focus on the silver linings. One of the nice things about 
the Northridge earthquake, she says, is that old friends from all over the 
world have checked in to see how they're doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, these calls have a certain poignancy. The other day, the Horns 
received a call from one of Bob's old fraternity brothers. He had not been 
aware of Bob's illness. 
</P>
<P>
 But this friend, and all the others, would be happy to know that Bob's wit 
survived the quake just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking with eyebrows, Bob says there is only one reason he went to the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't deal with the cleanup."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCY CHIEF STEPS 
DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a decade at the helm of Thousand Oaks' most far-reaching social service 
agency, activist Fred Wilson has stepped down from the presidency of Community 
Conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, 66, retired from the agency's board of directors this month after new 
rules took effect limiting board presidents to two three-year terms. He will 
continue to raise money and guide policy for Community Conscience from his post 
on the agency's executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
 A certified public accountant, Wilson co-founded Community Conscience in 1981 
and led the long campaign to build the Human Services Center for nonprofit 
counseling and care groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people told us we had to be out of our mind to even think about it, but 
we decided to go for it," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 His determination to help local nonprofit groups was sparked by the 
budget-cutting frenzy of the Reagan Administration, when the federal government 
slashed funding for many social service programs. After establishing an 
endowment fund, Wilson began to lobby corporations, private citizens and city 
governments for money to help struggling local agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 With Thousand Oaks' donation of land, Wilson and his colleagues eventually 
raised enough money to build the Human Services Center -- also known as Under 
One Roof -- at 80 Hillcrest Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Human Services Center houses nearly two dozen agencies ranging from a 
thrift shop run by senior citizens to a clinic offering free legal advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in need can get counseling on how to avoid child abuse, how to apply for 
jobs, how to balance a checkbook and how to set a budget. They can seek aid 
from Catholic Charities, Lutheran Social Services, the Jewish Federation 
Council or several nondenominational agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Conscience offers free space to these tenants. But to ensure that 
the no-rent policy will continue, the agency needs to raise about $750,000 to 
pay off the rest of the mortgage on the Human Services Center. 
</P>
<P>
 With Wilson retired, Community Conscience's new president, Eugene Dowd, will 
take over the "Prevent Rent" fund-raising campaign. He's enthusiastic, 
optimistic -- and slightly daunted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's fantastic that Fred had the foresight, vision and tenacity to 
get this thing going and rally people around," said Dowd, who has retired from 
the manufacturing business. "I don't know how the heck I'm going to fill his 
shoes or follow his giant footsteps. He's a tough act to follow." 
</P>
<P>
 Community Conscience's next fund-raising event will be the annual Mardi Gras 
ball and auction Feb. 15 at Lake Sherwood Country Club. STEPHANIE SIMON

 A 59-year-old Simi Valley woman died when the car in which she was riding made 
a left turn in front of another car, police said Wednesday.

 Yvette Sandra Mohr died of multiple injuries, Deputy Coroner Craig Stevens 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Traffic Sgt. Jeff Malgren said the accident occurred at 5:38 p.m. 
Tuesday when Eugene James Mohr tried to make a left turn at the intersection of 
Cochran Street and Tracy Avenue in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 His car was broadsided on the passenger's side by a car driven by Carlos 
Morales, 23, who was traveling east on Tracy Avenue. There was no sign that 
alcohol played a factor in the crash, Malgren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yvette Mohr was taken to Simi Valley Hospital, where she was pronounced dead 
at 6:32 p.m., Stevens said. Her husband was not injured, and Morales complained 
of some pain but was not treated at the hospital. JULIE FIELDS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: COUNCIL APPROVES PRICE-GOUGING LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The issue looked straightforward at first: Should the Thousand Oaks City 
Council enact a law to prevent price gouging during a disaster? Three council 
members swiftly said yes. But Mayor Elois Zeanah and Councilwoman Jaime 
Zukowski recoiled. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the council passed the ordinance on a 4-1 vote late Tuesday night, 
with Zeanah agreeing to ban price hikes of more than 10% on emergency goods and 
services. Before voting, however, council members engaged in a half-hour debate 
about what message the law would send. 
</P>
<P>
 Zukowski argued that an anti-gouging law would unjustly blacken the reputation 
of Thousand Oaks' merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than go after unethical businessmen with a city ordinance, she said, 
residents could take complaints to the Chamber of Commerce or the Better 
Business Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah said some merchants might have legitimate reasons for raising prices. 
She cited the example of a merchant who began charging $3 per battery 
immediately after the Jan. 17th earthquake. "Maybe it was a conscious decision 
(to discourage bulk buying) so more people would be able to buy batteries," 
Zeanah said. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members Frank Schillo, Judy Lazar and Alex Fiore argued the 
anti-gouging law was necessary to deter dramatic price hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not very consoling to tell (the victim) you're going to call the Chamber 
of Commerce," Schillo said. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CONTINUED OPERATION OF LANDFILL URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A county report released this week recommends approval of a proposal to allow 
the Bailard Landfill to continue operating for another three years or until it 
reaches 3 million tons of trash. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Planning Department report said the Ventura County Planning 
Commission should approve the proposal when it hears the issue today, but with 
a series of strict measures to reduce dust, noise and odor. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's meeting will be held at 8:30 a.m. in the supervisors' meeting room at 
the County Government Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Without those measures, the landfill should not be considered a "compatible 
land use" with the nearby Sister Servants of Mary convent, the River Ridge and 
Cypress Point housing developments or the planned high school, and the proposal 
to extend its life should be rejected, the report states. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want (the landfill) to at least be able to coexist with the neighbors," 
said Lynne Kada, county planner in charge of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The report recommends that the Ventura Regional Sanitation District, which 
operates the landfill, use chemical dust suppressants on all unpaved areas. The 
district should also be required to investigate the use of cover material other 
than soil, which is now used.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, the district should be required to design and install a filtration 
system to reduce dust, noise and odor at the convent to an acceptable level.  
</P>
<P>
 The district has already agreed to the conditions, Kada said. Regardless of 
the commission's decision Thursday, the Board of Supervisors is scheduled to 
hear the issue March 1. JOANNA M. MILLER

PRIEST TAKES THE STAND IN THEFT TRIAL OF HIS FORMER ASSISTANT; COURT: JAMES 
MCKEON SAYS HE FOUND CASH AND KEYS IN DAVID PIROLI'S ROOM. HE TELLS OF HIS OWN 
ODD WAY OF HANDLING MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a scene that pitted priest against priest, Father James McKeon took the 
stand Wednesday in the collection-plate embezzlement trial of his former 
assistant, Father David Dean Piroli. 
</P>
<P>
 In less than two hours of testimony, McKeon -- once Piroli's supervisor at St. 
Peter Claver Church in Simi Valley -- supplied ammunition to both sides in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon testified that he discovered four missing sets of church keys, 
parishioners' money and collection envelopes in the younger priest's bedroom 
about two weeks before Piroli's arrest in May, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But McKeon also admitted under cross-examination that he himself used an 
unorthodox style of handling cash -- taking collection money for incidental 
church expenses without telling anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are trying to prove charges that Piroli stole $60,000 in 
parishioners' collection money from St. Peter Claver and from his previous 
posting, Sacred Heart Church in Saticoy. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, defense attorney Richard Beada has alleged that McKeon was the 
one taking collection money and that he planted it in Piroli's bedroom, office 
and car to frame the younger priest, whom McKeon feared would expose his own 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Under direct questioning Wednesday by Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary Peace, McKeon 
laid out details of the church's money-handling procedures and told how he 
first discovered a cache of collection money in Piroli's rooms in the spring of 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon testified he had lost his keys and thoroughly searched the church, 
rectory and residence for them. 
</P>
<P>
 He finally looked in Piroli's dresser drawer one day in mid-May, McKeon 
testified, explaining, "I looked anyplace. . . . I needed those keys." 
</P>
<P>
 There, McKeon found two complete sets of his own keys and two sets to a church 
car, but he did not find the church master key, he testified. The master key 
was found later in Piroli's closet, church employees have testified. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon said he also found cash and collection envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was angry," McKeon testified, but he did not confront Piroli. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he might be planning to put it back in the collection," McKeon 
testified. "I didn't know what he was going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, on May 29, Hollywood police arrested Piroli after finding him 
and another man sitting in a church car that contained about $10,000 in cash, 
collection envelopes and traces of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 After learning of the arrest, McKeon said he and other parish officials pooled 
their personal cash and took enough from the previous Sunday's collection money 
to pay Piroli's $500 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 But Piroli left June 3 in the church car -- the day church employees found the 
last of about $50,000 in collection money in his bedroom and office -- and 
never returned to St. Peter Claver, McKeon testified. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon said he had approved the search of Piroli's rooms, and he later agreed 
to have the money moved to the church secretary's house because there was too 
much to be counted in the church offices. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon testified that he called Simi Valley police about the money but told 
officers that he did not want Piroli to be prosecuted. He said he later turned 
the money over to police after parishioners had counted it. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon also testified about collection procedures that he had set up for the 
church. He said he would store collection money in his office until mid-Sunday 
morning, when the church's volunteer money counters would pick it up.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The counters then would separate general donations from those contributions 
designated to the church building and a special program for the poor. General 
donations went straight to the church's main bank account and the special 
donations were given to McKeon. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon said he or the church office staff then would count those special 
donations and deposit them into separate bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon testified that every Sunday, he asked the money counters to give him 
$125 cash from collection money so he could pay youth aides, buy dinners for 
himself and Piroli, or entertain visiting priests. 
</P>
<P>
 He logged such expenses in a ledger that he called his "little black book, so 
I'd have a written record of expenditures." 
</P>
<P>
 But later during cross-examination by Beada, McKeon acknowledged he sometimes 
took cash from the collection bag for church expenses without telling the 
counters, who were supposed to be keeping track of all collection money 
received by the church.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet, McKeon testified, he also logged those amounts in his book. 
</P>
<P>
 As court adjourned for the day, McKeon asked the bailiff if he could leave a 
prayer card on the stand where he is to offer more testimony today. 
</P>
<P>
 The card carried a picture of praying hands and the "serenity prayer."

THOUSAND OAKS TO BUY SITE NEAR OLD CIVIC CENTER; REAL ESTATE: THE FIREWORKS 
HILL PROPOSAL IGNITES A HEATED COUNCIL DEBATE, WITH TWO MEMBERS IN OPPOSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving to preserve a cherished ridgeline while boosting the development 
potential of an oak-dotted hill, the Thousand Oaks City Council has voted to 
buy a 27-acre parcel behind the old civic center on Hillcrest Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The property -- known as Fireworks Hill because of the annual Fourth of July 
celebration there -- has been listed for sale at $650,000, but Councilman Alex 
Fiore said he believes city negotiators can cut a better deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Now owned by City National Bank in Beverly Hills, the parcel had been valued 
at more than $1 million before the real estate market collapsed. The current 
price is somewhat flexible -- but not much, broker Joe Wilkins said. "We put it 
on the market at $650,000 with every intention of selling it at that price, or 
very close," said Wilkins, who is marketing the property through Young 
Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 Buying the flat-topped, chaparral-covered hill will allow the city to protect 
the plateau, which offers an unparalleled view of Thousand Oaks. Several 
residents this week vowed to raise money for a park atop the steep slopes, 
perhaps featuring a dramatic sculpture of an oak tree painted sparkling gold. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to preserve this prime piece of real estate for the benefit of the 
community," businessman Russ Goodenough said after describing his vision of a 
Golden Oak Park. "We may never have this opportunity again." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to augmenting the city's open-space holdings, the purchase of 
Fireworks Hill would allow Thousand Oaks politicians to control development on 
the entire civic center property at 401 W. Hillcrest Drive, Fiore said. 
Fireworks Hill is situated just north of the city-owned civic center parcel, in 
the crook between St. Charles Drive and McCloud Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is counting on selling the 32-acre civic center parcel for roughly 
$12 million to pay for the last stage of construction at the new Civic Arts 
Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 By adding some sections of Fireworks Hill to the old civic center property, 
the city might lure more buyers, Fiore said. "It would make our property much 
more marketable," he told the council late Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential developers would be able to design their projects knowing that the 
plateau looming above them will remain bare or become a city park. 
</P>
<P>
 To further encourage buyers, the city might consider a so-called "density 
transfer" -- allowing more intense development on the civic center property 
after ensuring protection of the ridgeline. A citizens committee recently 
recommended such an approach to give developers more flexibility in dealing 
with the rough terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 While all council members Tuesday praised Fireworks Hill as one of Thousand 
Oaks' most prominent and important properties, Mayor Elois Zeanah and 
Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski voted against the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 In a heated exchange with Fiore, the mayor argued that the city could control 
development through zoning instead of putting up cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Zeanah said, residents had ranked Fireworks Hill ninth on a list 
of 17 properties worthy of open-space protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many sensitive parcels in our city that residents have asked us 
to purchase," she said. "This parcel has been on the bottom of citizens' wish 
list." 
</P>
<P>
 The other council members sat quietly through the arguments. But when Zeanah 
tried to link purchase of Fireworks Hill to alleged cost overruns at the Civic 
Arts Plaza, the debate turned nasty. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition of Fireworks Hill was designed, at least in part, to help the 
city sell its civic center property and raise money for the Civic Arts Plaza, 
Zeanah said. Thus, she argued, the city should include the Fireworks Hill 
purchase price in calculations of the Civic Arts Plaza's real cost. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Fireworks Hill, the city has bought several small parcels to 
improve access to the Civic Arts Plaza -- including Robert Heggen's maintenance 
yard along Oakwood Drive, which cost $600,000. Factoring all these purchases 
into the Civic Arts Plaza's cost would swell the much-publicized $64-million 
construction budget, Zeanah said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her comments drew an anguished "No, no, no, no, no" from Fiore, who berated 
his colleague for "putting a spin" on the facts and "tossing out numbers" 
without providing proof. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as the meeting dragged on into its sixth hour, Fiore resigned himself to 
another 3-2 vote and stopped trying to persuade Zeanah and Zukowski to support 
his motion to purchase Fireworks Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, brother," he said. "I give up."

OBITUARIES ; * FATHER VINCENT J. MCGARVEY; ASSOCIATE PASTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Father Vincent J. McGarvey, associate pastor of St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic 
Church in Ojai, died of a cerebral hemorrhage Wednesday in San Diego. He was 
76. 
</P>
<P>
 McGarvey began to prepare for the priesthood when he was still in high school 
in Philadelphia. He joined the Augustinian Order in 1930 and was ordained a 
priest in 1942. McGarvey served in various parishes for the next 20 years. In 
1962, he was appointed to head the Augustinian Order in the Western United 
States, where he served for six years. During his tenure, the order opened its 
first West Coast seminary in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next 25 years, McGarvey served as pastor at churches in San Diego, 
Castro Valley and Oregon. In June, 1992, he arrived in Ojai to serve as 
associate pastor. Pastor Patrick Keane said McGarvey was in semi-retirement. 
Parishioners remembered him for his children's Masses, where he asked them to 
sit with him at the altar while he read from the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a very gentle, kind man," said Keane, who also remembered McGarvey as 
an avid sports fan. "He always supported the Philadelphia teams, of course." 
</P>
<P>
 McGarvey is survived by three brothers, Thomas, John and Leo. 
</P>
<P>
 A vigil service will be held at 7:30 p.m. Sunday at St. Patrick's Church in 
San Diego. McGarvey will be buried at 10 a.m. Monday at the Augustinian plot at 
Holy Cross Cemetery, San Diego.

FLAMES GET A VICTORY, KEY INJURY 
</P>

<P>
 Another Mighty Duck game, another injured opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrei Trefilov, Calgary's standout rookie goaltender, became the latest 
casualty when he left Wednesday night's game on a stretcher with an 
undetermined injury to his right knee late in the second period of the Ducks' 
4-2 loss in front of 17,174 at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks are suddenly bad news for the other guys, and not just by hanging 
close in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
 Winnipeg's Teemu Selanne suffered a partially torn Achilles' tendon against 
the Ducks last week, and the Kings had a passel of injuries in their victory 
over the Ducks on Saturday -- Gary Shuchuk hurt his knee, Luc Robitaille had a 
minor ankle injury, and Wayne Gretzky was cut on the gum, the nose or nowhere 
at all, depending on whom you talk to. 
</P>
<P>
 At least this time, Duck defenseman Don McSween had nothing to do with it. 
McSween accidentally cut Selanne with his skate blade, was in on a collision 
with Shuchuk and was the unintentional perpetrator of the controversial 
high-sticking major against Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 Trefilov was hurt when he tried to make a sudden move in the crease but didn't 
appear to be hit by a Duck. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a serious collision or anything, he just goes down in a funny 
manner," said Calgary Coach Dave King, who reported that Trefilov was taken to 
a hospital and there was concern about ligament damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks were trying to pick up a point or two against the top team in the 
Pacific Division, but they ended up learning what it feels like to play 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was tied, 2-2, entering the third, but the Ducks made a couple of 
errors and Calgary's Robert Reichel scored twice to claim two points for the 
Flames. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a chance to make up some ground tonight because of the Kings' loss 
(6-4 to Edmonton), but we had a couple of mental breakdowns that cost us 
goals," right wing Terry Yake said. "They just waited for us to make the 
mistakes, so in a sense they beat us at our own game." 
</P>
<P>
 Reichel scored the go-ahead goal at 2:05 after picking off a pass by Duck 
defenseman Bill Houlder in the Duck zone and beating goalie Ron Tugnutt from 
high in the slot. 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt, making his first start since Jan. 16, didn't appear to make much of a 
move to stop the shot, but the puck took a bit of a bad bounce after being 
partially deflected by a defenseman's stick. 
</P>
<P>
 Reichel gave the Flames a cushion at 14:55 with his 22nd goal of the season 
when Calgary got out on a 3-on-1 rush with McSween the only player back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously it was a disappointing loss," Duck Coach Ron Wilson said. "It was a 
strange goal on the third one. Then they just went into a defensive shell. Once 
they got that one-goal lead, they pretty much shut us down." 
</P>
<P>
 Trefilov, 24, had consecutive shutouts this season and entered the game with a 
2.47 goals-against average. With Mike Vernon on the verge of recovering from a 
twisted knee, he has been crucial to the Flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Trefilov went down in the crease as Tim Sweeney swung his stick in an attempt 
to swat in a rebound, but television replays showed no contact. 
</P>
<P>
 With medical personnel working deliberately to move Trefilov to a stretcher 
and carry him off the ice and only 5.5 seconds remaining in the period, referee 
Ron Hoggarth sent the teams into the dressing rooms early. 
</P>
<P>
 Trevor Kidd took over in goal, but not much was asked immediately from him. 
The Ducks had a harmless shot in the final seconds of the second period, but 
didn't manage another until 11:28 of the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Nieuwendyk gave Calgary a 1-0 lead at 10:55 of the first, but the Ducks 
evened the score at 2:15 of the second on Joe Sacco's 65-foot slap shot from 
the edge of the center faceoff circle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks led, 2-1, after Yake scored his 16th goal of the season at 14:48 of 
the second, but Calgary came right back, with Gary Roberts tying the score 59 
seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
 And once they got the lead, the Flames focused on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Calgary did the exact same to us as we're supposed to do to them," Yake said. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Anatoli Semenov, who played two games after returning from a seven-week layoff 
with a dislocated left elbow, missed a second consecutive game because of 
soreness in the elbow. Defenseman Alexei Kasatonov (bruised right foot) was 
also scratched for a second consecutive game.

U.S. WOMAN PREVAILS IN DOWNHILL; SKIING: LINDH WINS LAST WORLD CUP RACE BEFORE 
OLYMPICS. IN WAKE OF MAIER'S DEATH, AUSTRIAN TEAM DOES NOT COMPETE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In the last downhill race before the Lillehammer Winter Olympics and the first 
after the death of Austrian Ulrike Maier, America's Hilary Lindh scored her 
first World Cup victory Wednesday at Sierra Nevada, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindh, the 1992 Olympic silver medalist, won with a time of 2 minutes 4.21 
seconds, defeating Melanie Suchet of France by 0.01 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindh and others raced with the pall of Maier's death hanging over the women's 
World Cup circuit. Maier was killed Saturday after she crashed on the downhill 
course at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 In deference to Maier, who will be buried today, the Austrian women's team did 
not compete in Wednesday's race, which had been scheduled for Friday but was 
moved up to avoid a storm that is expected in the region later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup officials on Wednesday canceled a men's downhill ski race on the 
same course where the Austrian star broke her neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard to put it out of your mind," Lindh said of the Maier crash in a 
conference call from Sierra Nevada. "I view it as two different subjects: The 
Ulli accident was really freaky, we all know something like that can happen, 
but it doesn't happen often. We were all definitely thinking about her; I'm 
especially thinking about her daughter who she left behind. But that's separate 
from when you're out there skiing." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Lindh's first victory in eight World Cup seasons and her second top-10 
finish this season. She was fourth in a downhill at Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, 
on Jan. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindh, 24, of Juneau, Alaska, appears to have fully recovered from knee 
surgery that forced her to miss most of the 1992-93 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had two good, solid results," she said. "At the same time, I know the 
media will be a lot more interested to see how I'm doing; so will the people at 
home. Whatever happens, it will be worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 It was another strong showing for the U.S. speed contingent. Krista 
Schmidinger finished eighth in the race, Megan Gerety 14th.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: A CLOSET NEAT FREAK -- AN ORDERLY APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Neat people can be intimidating -- especially the ones who maintain order in 
places the rest of us can't even see. To me, the visible world is complicated 
enough without having to worry about the disposition of our cabinets, drawers 
and closets. Isn't that, in fact, why we invented cabinets, drawers and 
closets? So when Mom or other guests arrive unexpectedly, we can quickly stow 
our surplus goods? 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, not everyone shares this view. A friend of mine's closet is not 
merely neat, it looks like a Montessori classroom before the kids arrive. All 
the clothes are organized by type and color, with each item of clothing 
suspended from a color-coordinated hanger, and everything in proper rainbow 
order, according to the color spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 Pancho Doll, who wrote this week's cover piece on closet organization, also 
included an accompanying story -- a first-person confession on being a neat 
freak. This revelation was no surprise to those of us who know him. The week 
before he started working here, he showed up in the parking lot with the entire 
contents of his life in the back seat of his car, all of it neatly packed in an 
assortment of milk crates and 16-ounce yogurt containers. 
</P>
<P>
 Doll is rather proud of his reputation for being neat -- both in car and in 
closet. "After all, the closet is the most personal space in the home -- with 
the possible exception of the bedside table and the medicine chest," he said. 
Doll also seems to think that he might be on the cutting edge, at least the 
Ginzu-Knife edge, of popular culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Closets have drawn a lot of attention in recent years," he said. "A popular 
Japanese television show consisted of video closet muggings. Film crews 
approached people on the street and asked to follow them home and tape the 
contents of their closets." 
</P>
<P>
 As a variation on this, Doll decided to survey some closets in Ventura County. 
It turned out to be a tougher assignment than you might think. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would call people and ask them if I could come by with a photographer. A 
couple of them asked, 'What paper did you say you were from? Is this what the 
L. A. Times is doing now?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Doll insists that the story has merit, and he has managed to find 
some sociologists and psychologists to agree with him. But he and the experts 
agree that closet behavior, like closets, can be disordered. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to the famous psychologist Seymour Adler, neatness is one thing, 
compulsiveness is another," he said. "If your clothes arrive from the cleaner 
facing the wrong way on the hanger and you get so upset that you can't go to 
work, that is generally considered compulsive."

<P>
 ALHAMBRA: Mayor Barbara A. Messina will hold the first of a series of meetings 
with the community to talk about how City Hall works. The meeting will be at 
7:30 tonight at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has agreed to replace the Fire and Police departments' 
dispatch system with one that will allow officers to use computer terminals to 
get information on suspects and their records. 
</P>
<P>
 BRADBURY: Former City Manager Aurora (Dolly) Vollaire, 54, pleaded not guilty 
Friday to six felony counts relating to the alleged use of city money for 
personal items. A pretrial hearing was set for March 18. 
</P>
<P>
 DIAMOND BAR: The City Council will spend $60,000 to keep the town's branch of 
the county library open two more days a week through June. Beginning Feb. 14, 
the library will be open Thursdays and Saturdays, in addition to Monday through 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 GLENDORA: After 10 months of negotiations, the Glendora City Council approved 
a three-year police contract. Officers will receive an extra $33 dollars a 
month to pay for medical benefits for 1994. Increases in benefits and salary 
over the next two years will depend on a salary survey of 10 police departments 
across the valley.

CITY HALL NEWS; SWITCHING FIRE SERVICES TO COUNTY DRAWS CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE DONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pomona City Council's recent vote to contract its fire services to Los 
Angeles County ended a hot issue, but it hasn't doused debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, which passed by a 4-3 vote Jan. 10, will bring county fire 
protection for Pomona's nearly 140,000 residents.Logistics are still being 
worked out and there is no date yet set for the transfer. But many residents 
lament the conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is that there is absolutely nothing the county can do for us that 
we can't do for ourselves," said Bob Jackson, a member of the Support Committee 
to Keep the Pomona Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The council debate, and vote, came down to what made dollars and sense for a 
city facing a $3-million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's bid for services came in at nearly $500,000 less than the city's. 
The pro-city camp claimed, though, that the county would pass on expenses -- 
for station repairs, equipment maintenance, and wage increases -- that would 
eventually raise county costs above the city's. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what happens over five years that matters," said Mayor Eddie Cortez, who 
voted against the proposal.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Marco Robles said the move makes sense. "It's unrealistic to think 
we can keep a Fire Department through the year 2000 and beyond that meets our 
needs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Capt. Bob Baker, Pomona serves nearly twice as many residents 
with 40 fewer firefighters than when he joined the department 20 years ago. The 
county Fire Department can supplement Pomona's existing services with an 
additional 11 stations and 150 firefighters within five miles of the city.

STRUCTURES; MUSEUM BASKS IN ITS CLASSICAL GLORY; CARNEGIE IS RENOWNED FOR ITS 
GREEK STYLE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF ITS ART COLLECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There it stands, with its Greek classicism intact, beaming with bright 
white-walled authority. Ringed by towering columns that uphold ornamented 
pediments, the Carnegie Art Museum stands out in its downtown Oxnard 
neighborhood on South C Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The question remains: Is it a jewel of the city or a jewel out of context? Is 
the Carnegie an example of elegance set amid mediocrity, or a case of 
historical and stylistic irrelevance? 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, the Carnegie has a singular importance in the realm of local 
culture, as one of the consistently important art venues in Ventura County. 
Specializing in art from Southern California, past and present, the museum, for 
the most part, uses its ample spaces well. 
</P>
<P>
 On a larger historical scale, though, the structure's importance has less to 
do with the art than the Carnegie. Built in 1906 as part of the Carnegie 
Library chain, the building is one of the few Carnegie structures still 
standing. 
</P>
<P>
 Historical preservationists can be thanked for that -- just as the rustic 
Carnegie library built in 1903 in San Luis Obispo now serves as a historical 
museum. Oxnard's Carnegie building, which ceased being a library in 1963 when a 
new one was built, was designated as a County Historical landmark in 1971. For 
many years the site of the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce, it has been home to the 
city's art museum since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Carnegie, the mythic man behind it all, was a multimillionaire steel baron 
from Scotland, who, around the turn of the century, began divesting his fortune 
in philanthropic causes. One of his goals was to champion the creation of free 
libraries around the land. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote that "we have nothing to fear in our great Republic because of our 
Free School System and the Free Libraries. A reading people are of course an 
active people, full of new ideas and anxious to test them, which ensures 
peaceful development. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 News of Carnegie's offer to fund libraries spread quickly, and reached the 
young, burgeoning sugar beet town of Oxnard. Mayor Richard B. Haydock and City 
Atty. Isaac W. Stewart spearheaded the drive to take advantage of the Carnegie 
challenge, which required the individual cities to provide sites and promises 
of ongoing city support. 
</P>
<P>
 Prominent early figures in Oxnard's history figured into the realization of 
the plan. Henry T. Oxnard, one of the brothers after whom the city was named, 
donated the site. Achille Levy, the banker, was one of those who agreed to fund 
the furnishing of the library. 
</P>
<P>
 James Bertram, the reputedly irascible executor of Carnegie's library program, 
agreed to give $12,000 toward the building, which ultimately cost $16,016. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles architect Franklin P. Burnham was commissioned to design the 
classical structure, built by longtime local contractor Thomas Carroll. 
Building went slowly, in part because of the shortage of building materials in 
California following the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 When completed in 1907, the Oxnard Courier called it "a stately monument to 
art and literature . . . dedicated to the people in a simple yet beautifully 
impressive manner." 
</P>
<P>
 All told, 1,679 libraries, at least partly funded by Carnegie, were built in 
the United States between 1886 and 1919, 142 of them in California. 
</P>
<P>
 As the program went on, Carnegie and Bertram responded to architectural 
criticism and paid closer attention to the look of the libraries being erected 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Oxnard's Greek palace been planned several years later, it might have been 
vetoed by Carnegie, who suddenly decried the turning of libraries into "Greek 
temples." 
</P>
<P>
 Architectural tastes shift with the tides of fashion and individual 
perspective. What might be considered majestic and "a stately monument" by one 
observer is a cliche to another. 
</P>
<P>
 An 86-year-old structure such as the Carnegie, so shamelessly and 
unapologetically classicist and retro, is bound to get mixed reviews. In the 
1990s, it sits in lonely, lovingly maintained glory, a quaint relic from a time 
when classical revival was serious business. 
</P>
<P>
 Compare the former library, for instance, with the new, third Oxnard library, 
completed last year. The new building gently embraces ideals set forth by 
post-modernist thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, the monumentality is downplayed with supple, sculpted forms. Although 
larger than the Carnegie, it makes a more graceful pact with its huge property. 
Humbler in size but more pompous in its general impression, the Carnegie speaks 
in lofty tones. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever your opinion of the place, it is an impressive edifice. At a time 
when generic and corporate architecture dots the landscape, and numbs the 
senses to our surroundings, a little heroic Greek ostentation never hurts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of it, indifference is not an option. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Carnegie Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: 424 S. C St., Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>

BLIND TWINS SHARE A SPECIAL VISION OF RADIO'S PAST; BROADCASTING: JOHN AND 
LARRY GASSMAN, 39, HAVE TURNED THEIR PASSION FOR THE OLD-TIME DRAMA OF THE 
AIRWAVES INTO A WEEKLY SHOW ON KPCC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 John and Larry Gassman have never seen a picture of Superman. They can't. Born 
more than two months premature, their optic nerves never matured enough to 
allow them to ever see anything. 
</P>
<P>
 So they listen instead. Since childhood, the 39-year-old identical twins have 
been hooked on radio dramas, listening to shows that allow them to use their 
imaginations to follow the red-caped Man of Steel as he leaped tall buildings 
in a single bound. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of our earliest memories is hearing a radio drama when we were 5 or 6," 
said John, who along with his brother has developed a zealous determination to 
never let the recordings of old-time radio dramas such as "Superman," 
"Gunsmoke" and "The Green Hornet" vanish from the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Their collection of nearly 20,000 reel-to-reel tapes of vintage shows lines 
the walls and spreads onto the floor of the family room-turned-studio, from 
which the Gassmans produce a weekly show of classic radio drama for KPCC-FM 
(89.3) in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 John walks slowly among the stacks of tapes on the floor, some recently 
deposited on the carpet of their Whittier home by the Northridge earthquake. He 
puts on headphones as he nears a table covered in reel-to-reel tape machines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh great, now I can't hear where I'm going," he mumbles, reaching his hands 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it's never stopped you before," said Larry, who is already seated in 
front of his microphone. Their fingers dance deftly across the dials of their 
tape recorders and then the two launch into the introduction to their show, 
"Same Time, Same Channel" (heard Sundays from 5 to 7 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 "Got a lot of variety on the show this week," John says. He adds that the 
herniated disc that was pinching the nerves in Larry's neck has been removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we've found you can't play the disc (on a turntable) with acupuncture 
needles after all," John says. "So stop calling." 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got a lot of nerve mentioning that," Larry quips. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is timed using a talking clock that quietly rattles off 10-second 
increments in a canned digital voice out of range of the microphones, and their 
talking watches have a crowing-rooster alarm to stop them from running over. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers still make their tapes on reel-to-reel recorders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's harder to use the new tape recorders," Larry says. "We've always had to 
do everything by feel and sound, and the new buttons don't make any noise." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of their collection is taped from records donated by radio drama stars, 
such as the late Vincent Price, John says. The 16-inch discs captured about 15 
minutes of performance on each side of an aluminum-based record. During World 
War II, such records were made on glass to save the metal for the war effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put ads in the papers when we started collecting, and word spread from 
word-of-mouth that we wanted the recordings," John says. "People are usually 
glad to give (the records) to us because we have the turntables to play them 
and the equipment to preserve the discs," which are very fragile. 
</P>
<P>
 KPCC is a public radio station broadcasting from Pasadena City College, so the 
brothers do their show for free. They get by on Social Security and a little 
money they make from singing with a local barbershop quartet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gassmans started playing records at Rio Hondo College in the early 1970s. 
After earning degrees in communications from Cal Poly Pomona, they got their 
chance to fill the radio drama slot at KPCC in 1980 after an announcer moved to 
Arizona. They've been spinning stacks of old records ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're remarkable guys, and their knowledge and love of radio as an art form 
is just very special" said KPCC Program and News Director Larry Mantle, who has 
worked with the Gassmans for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Gassmans) appreciate a lot of things that made radio exciting before 
market-driven companies got into it," Mantle said. "So much of what we hear 
today on radio is commercialized and dull." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that radio drama is making it big-time. Arbitron ratings show that they 
attract about 15,000 listeners during their two-hour broadcasts. By comparison, 
KLSX's Howard Stern pulls in about 1.2 million listeners each morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gassmans continued to break new ground when they covered the Rose Parade 
for KPCC from 1987 to 1989. Their broadcasts, which won an advertising industry 
award, were the result of tours of the floats in which they were allowed to 
clamber all over the petal-covered creations and literally feel their sizes, 
shapes and textures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really popular because we described all the floats in detail, and 
nobody does that any more on TV. But we never got to drive one. I always wish 
we'd gotten to drive a float -- we asked but we couldn't because of insurance," 
John said.

NIGHT LIFE: SAN DIEGO CLUB SCENE GRADUATES; FIVE-MEMBER GROUP RECENTLY SIGNED A 
RECORD DEAL AND RELEASED A DEBUT CD, 'JAUNDICE.'

 Lucy's Fur Coat is this week's wise-guy rock band, as subtle as a tarantula on 
the wedding cake. And wise guy is right -- all five Lucy members are college 
dudes. 
</P>
<P>
 On a bill with an Equal Rights Amendment-fund-raising potential of a minus 
six, the Lucy band will be playing with Ventura's own can't-take-them anywhere 
band, the Hymen Blasters. Also performing are those blast-furnace-in-the-face 
rockers, Pinching Judy. All of this Friday night at the Midnight Hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lucy band got going a few years ago in San Diego, playing the local club 
scene, including the legendary Bodie's, which helped unleash the likes of the 
Beat Farmers and Mojo Nixon on an unsuspecting world. Lucy's Fur Coat recently 
was signed to Relativity Records, which released their debut CD, "Jaundice." 
</P>
<P>
 The boys in the band, who don't know a lot of slow ones, include: Charlie 
Ware, who sings, Tony Sanfilippo and Mike Santos on guitars, Rob Brown on bass 
and Scott Bauer on drums. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanging out in the 619 area code by their speaker phone, Sanfilippo and Ware 
talked about their favorite band, named after TV's favorite redhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We need to get the introductions out of the way; so who's Lucy? 
</P>
<P>
 Ware: Lucille Ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Where did you meet Judy? 
</P>
<P>
 Sanfilippo: We have the same manager, and we played with them once in New York 
City. Pinching Judy is cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your bio describes "Jaundice" as your long-awaited debut album. So who was 
waiting? 
</P>
<P>
 Sanfilippo: Our moms, dads and sisters were waiting. My parents were even at 
our last gig. They like us a lot, except my mom is always telling me to quit 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did it work? 
</P>
<P>
 Sanfilippo: Does it ever? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did you guys have a tape or anything before the CD? 
</P>
<P>
 Ware: Yeah, we had a demo tape. A one-day, six-song demo tape. We sounded like 
Foreigner. We hated it so much, we wouldn't give it to anyone. Then our friends 
hated us. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does San Diego rock? 
</P>
<P>
 Ware: Sure, there'll always be good bands here. We identify with all the bands 
we grew up with three years ago. Uncle John's Big Old Driver, Fluf, Inch and 
Rust all got signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's it like at Bodie's? 
</P>
<P>
 Ware: It's a place we play pretty often, but the Casbah, that's the place. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So you guys actually have day jobs? 
</P>
<P>
 Ware: Some of us really do. Mike Santos is a CPA, Rob Brown is a draftsman and 
Bauer is an X-ray technician. I just passed the bar exam, but right now I just 
do a little temporary work here and there. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanfilippo: I just got out of college and I don't do anything. It was great, 
especially if your mom and dad pay for it all. College is a time to hang out 
and be a kid some more. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did you guys get signed by playing one of those ASCAP showcases? 
</P>
<P>
 Ware: Hell if I know. We don't have a formula. I think that ASCAP showcase 
helped, but bands don't usually get signed by playing there. No one from 
Relativity was there, but a guy named Cliff Cultrei from their New York office 
called us later and set up another showcase just for him. After three or four 
songs, we thought he hated us, but instead, he offered us a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has the band changed since you got signed? 
</P>
<P>
 Ware: Not a bit; we haven't changed since we've been together. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Who writes the songs? 
</P>
<P>
 Ware: Santos writes all the songs on an acoustic guitar, sort of like Cracker, 
then Tony beefs them up. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's alternative music? 
</P>
<P>
 Ware: A label. It's music that no longer exists. We're not alternative. Maybe 
it has something to do with art. We stay away from art; we do rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When you play, do people dance, stare or merely run for their worthless 
lives? 
</P>
<P>
 Ware: They pretty much get into it. They sort of stay in their own little 
space and move around. We try not to encourage slamming. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So what's next? 
</P>
<P>
 Ware: Extensive touring after a video. Details

MEN SOUGHT IN TATTOO PARLOR KILLINGS; SHOOTING: THREE SUSPECTS FLEE LA PUENTE 
BUSINESS AFTER ARGUMENT LEAVES TWO DEAD AND ANOTHER WOUNDED. 
</P>

 Police were searching Wednesday for a gunman and two other suspects wanted in 
the slayings of two men at a La Puente tattoo parlor Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Tattoo artist Nicholas Marquez Sr., 43, of Hacienda Heights and Robert Jesse 
Rodriguez, 37, were struck by several bullets fired by an unidentified man 
about 2:31 p.m. after angry words were exchanged at Tattoo Land on Amar Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Both died at the scene about 15 minutes later, the Los Angeles County 
coroner's office reported. 
</P>
<P>
 A third man, Stephen Perez, 30, of Hacienda Heights was struck in the back and 
staggered around the corner to a Payless Shoe Store on North Hacienda 
Boulevard, where he pushed open the door and fell to the floor, said store 
manager Juan Estrada. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was saying, 'I'm shot, I'm shot' over and over and holding his back. Then 
he fell down on the floor and I dialed 911," said Estrada, 31, of West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez was taken by ambulance to Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina 
where he remains in fair condition and is expected to recover, said hospital 
spokeswoman Catherine Habel. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Bob Stoneman of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said the 
gunman and two other male suspects immediately fled the tattoo parlor after the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Though some employees of a furniture warehouse next door to the shooting scene 
reported a "suspicious character" with green-dyed hair lurking around the front 
of the tattoo parlor, investigators still have no solid descriptions of the 
suspects. Witnesses who were in the tattoo parlor during the slayings said 
there was an argument before the shooting, but said they didn't know what the 
argument was about and could not give a description of the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're searching for them now, but we don't have any better description than 
we're looking for three males involved in the shooting," Stoneman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada and other business owners in the strip mall complex where the tattoo 
parlor is located reported no previous violent incidents and described the area 
as quiet.

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: YODELER WITH GUITAR AND R & B ROOTS GETS THOSE FEET MOVING; 
DIANE LYNNE AND THE STARS & STRIPES BAND RETURN THIS WEEKEND TO THE FRONTIER 
NIGHT CLUB, KNOWN FOR ITS SPACIOUS DANCE FLOOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 If you've never visited the Frontier Night Club in Santa Paula, this weekend 
would be a great time to check it out. This self-proclaimed "Home of Western 
Music, Music for Life" -- is one of Ventura County's original honky tonks. So 
don't expect any line dance lessons, but do expect a spacious dance floor, high 
ceilings and great atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, owner Shelby Montes has booked some top-notch bands. This weekend 
marks the return of Diane Lynne and the Stars & Stripes Band. Whether you like 
to line dance or do the couples thing, you'll find this group will get your 
feet in gear. And Lynne's vocals are a knockout. 
</P>
<P>
 This yodeling, guitar-playing, R & B-turned-country-singer has been lighting 
up the San Fernando Valley country music club scene since January, 1992. But 
the New Jersey native started her career on that other coast in 1982 as the 
opening act for an Elvis impersonator. She also played the Tri-State casino 
circuit. Her album credits so far are with a jazz fusion group called "Axiom" 
on Cexton Records. Their CD is entitled "Spirit of Light." 
</P>
<P>
 But since Lynne's conversion to country music two years ago she has opened for 
the Bellamy Brothers in Las Vegas. And she has collaborated with Nashville 
songwriter, Joyce Harrison, on some original tunes, which appear on Lynne's 
demo tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throughout my career people always told me I should do country-Western," said 
Lynne, who puts her professionally trained five-octave range to good use on 
contemporary and some classic country tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We welcome requests and can do popular songs and obscure ones like Reba 
McEntire's 'Fancy.' " Lynne also does justice to Patsy Cline favorites. But 
yodeling took some time to master. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I actually heard one of my mentors do it was Suzy Bogguss in a 
concert singing 'Cowboy Sweetheart,' an old Patsy Montana song. I kept 
listening to that song over and over until I got it. It is a feeling of 
intervals and placement -- where you place the sound to determine which bones 
in your face it's going to vibrate off of," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynne said she's concentrating on developing her vocal style. She's backed by 
a solid, top-notch band that includes her husband and band leader, Gabe Lamog 
on bass, drummer Dean Brown, lead guitarist Barrett Tagliarino and Eddie 
Greeley on keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
 The band also played all the background on her two country demo tapes. And 
Greeley has written two new up-tempo country songs for her that haven't yet 
been recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's lush vocal harmonies on "Many a Lonely Night," present cowboy cha 
cha fans with a lovely change from the over-used "Neon Moon." And pedal steel 
and mandolin riffs enhance "Country Girl." This original fast, floor-polishin' 
two-step has lyrics that praise all forms of country dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Country dancing is all new to me," admitted Lynne. "But I really like to 
watch the cowboy cha cha and waltz. They're very graceful. And sometimes I even 
get out there and join the line dancers, especially at Cinnamon Cinder in 
Burbank. And the fans really feel like they're part of the show." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cousin's Country Saloon in Simi Valley has new times for dance lessons: 5 to 7 
p.m. Sundays; 6 to 8 p.m. Tuesdays; 6:30 to 8 p.m. Wednesdays and Thursdays; 7 
to 8:30 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. And now, in addition to her gig at 
Cousin's, instructor Kathy Bailey teaches country dancing 7:30 to 8:30 p.m. on 
Thursdays at Schooner Time (5710 Los Angeles Ave. in Simi Valley, 526-1488).

TOPICS / BUSINESS; FEES REDUCED AT SWAP MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Managers at the L.A. International Marketplace in Irwindale have given vendors 
a break on their rent, and the city has agreed to negotiate a discount on the 
business license fee for the swap meet operator. 
</P>
<P>
 Managers of the 64-acre outdoor swap meet, which opened in July, asked the 
city for financial relief, including exempting unoccupied vendor stations from 
a $5-per-space monthly business license fee. Vendor space occupancy is running 
about 50% among the 893 spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marketplace got off to a good start, with 90% occupancy during late summer 
and fall. But winter is a slow time for the business. 
</P>
<P>
 A vendor space of 15 feet square once cost $25 to $30 a day; now it costs $18.

TOPICS / HEALTH; 2 LOCAL HOSPITALS ON NATION'S TOP 100 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two San Gabriel Valley hospitals -- Methodist Hospital of Southern California 
in Arcadia and West Covina's Queen of the Valley Hospital -- are on a list of 
the country's top 100.  
</P>
<P>
 The list is from a study called "100 Top U.S. Hospitals -- Benchmarks for 
Success."It was released in January by two health care consulting firms -- 
Health Care Investment Analysts and Mercer Management Consulting. 
</P>
<P>
 The firms studied 1992 data from the country's 5,600 acute care hospitals and 
named the top 2% based on categories that included mortality, infection rates 
and financial stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitals were not ranked or cited individually. 
</P>
<P>
 At Queen of the Valley, President Pete Makowski said the hospital's "110% 
Club" recognizes staff members who go beyond the call of duty. A recent winner 
was an oncology nurse who surprised a terminally ill patient with an 
anniversary cake, he said. The nurse bought the cake herself after learning 
that the patient could not go home to celebrate with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Methodist Hospital President Dennis M. Lee said the medical staff, management 
and other employees work as a team to solve problems. One such team developed a 
plan that got laboratory test results to physicians hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The study's authors noted: "If all hospitals were able to perform at the level 
of these benchmark facilities, the results for the health care industry would 
be dramatic; hospital charges would decline by $40 billion; mortality rates 
would drop 12%, and morbidity rates would drop 13%."

TOPICS / EDUCATION; AT I-POLY, THE WORLD IS THEIR CLASSROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Around the globe, high school cyberspace is jamming with talk of Mortal Kombat 
video games, the rock sounds of the Smashing Pumpkins and Doc Martens 
grunge-wear boots. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, students at a new high school on the Cal Poly Pomona campus can't 
wait to jump into the action and read their computer E-mail from English 
classes in places such as Hong Kong, Japan and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The conversation is the fast and furious language of youth, in which debates 
on U.S. troops in Bosnia turn on a dime to, "Hey, did you read the messages 
from those 16-year-old boys in Europe who get to drink beer legally?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like we're all one people," said Sonya Torres, 14, a freshman at the Los 
Angeles County International Polytechnic High School, known as I-Poly. "There's 
one race, the human race. I've lost a lot of my prejudices . . . like the 
Japanese eat rice or whatever, or the Russians are, like, smarter," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Sonya and 11 other freshmen are part of the first class at I-Poly, a public 
high school in which international themes are woven through the curriculum. The 
students, for instance, study English through international E-mail pen pals, 
math through tracking stocks on the global market and foreign languages at Cal 
Poly's language laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 On Fridays, students review what they learned that week through class skits; a 
recent one involved mock interviews with President Clinton and former President 
George Bush, complete with presidential masks.  
</P>
<P>
 I-Poly, which is run by the county Office of Education and Cal Poly Pomona, 
was funded by a $150,000 grant from the state Department of Education's high 
school education office. Teachers and staff are from Cal Poly Pomona and local 
school districts. The county's two other specialty high schools are Cal State 
L.A.S' performing arts high school and Cal State Dominguez Hills' math/science 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Poly's high school is open to students in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, 
Riverside and Orange counties. Selection is based on applications, personal 
interviews and essays. The first class, which started in September, ranges from 
honors students to at-risk teen-agers with potential, said Principal Chris 
Dayian. This month, 60 more students will join the school. The numbers will 
gradually increase until enrollment reaches about 500. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next couple of years, Dayian plans to arrange for the students to spend 
a semester abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Anderson, 15, said I-Poly is more demanding than other high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, other schools teach out of a book," she said. At I-Poly, teachers 
"get right down into the culture."

COMMUNITY DIGEST: POMONA; COUNTY FAIR WON'T RAISE TICKET PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The price of an admission ticket to the Los Angeles County Fair will not 
change this year, fair officials announced recently. 
</P>
<P>
 As with last year's fair, regular adult prices will remain at $8 and children 
6 through 12 will pay $4.Children 5 and younger will be admitted free. However, 
parking for this year's fair, which will be Sept. 9 through Oct. 2, will cost 
$4, $1 more than last year.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, fair officials cut admission prices to 1991 levels because fair 
attendance and revenues plummeted in 1992 after a 20% increase in admission 
prices. Fair officials said last year's reduced ticket prices helped fair 
attendance reach about 1.4 million -- 162,000 more than in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 From an all-time high of $4.2 million in 1991, the fair association's earnings 
after expenses fell to $850,000 in 1992. Fair attendance dropped from an 
all-time high of 1.6 million in 1991 to 1.2 million in 1992.

 Volunteers should go to Eaton Canyon Nature Center at 8 a.m. Wednesdays, 
Saturdays and Sundays for the next four to five weeks. Wear hiking boots, warm 
clothing and bring water and a lunch. Four-wheel drive vehicles and pickup 
trucks are needed.

 Thanks in part to erosion-control efforts, the fire-ravaged Pasadena Glen area 
survived recent rains intact, but homeowners fear stronger torrents could cause 
serious mudslide damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Dean, a U.S. Soil Conservation official, said a recently built barrier at 
the end of Grambling Lane in Kinneloa blocked nine feet of debris from plunging 
into the Glen, and sandbag stacks and newly dredged channels kept water and mud 
from flowing off-course.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: PASADENA; ROSE BOWL TICKET FRAUD PROMPTS FEDERAL ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pressure from Wisconsin lawmakers seeking a solution to the type of ticket 
fraud problems that plagued many Badger fans at this year's Rose Bowl has the 
Department of Transportation working on changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Current regulations forbid charter operators from advertising Super Bowl tours 
unless fans are guaranteed seats.The federal agency has been urged to amend the 
rule to include major collegiate sporting events.  
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Scott Klug (R-Madison) spearheaded the effort to get the 1980 regulation 
changed to include college bowl games, the Final Four basketball tournament and 
possibly the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a touchdown, a home run and a slam dunk all in one," Klug said. 
"These regulations will put the squeeze on all levels to make sure we don't see 
a repeat of the Rose Bowl fiasco at other college bowl games." 
</P>
<P>
 Klug said his office has received thousands of calls from irate Wisconsin fans 
who spent hundreds of dollars to reserve Rose Bowl tickets only to arrive in 
Pasadena to find their tickets did not exist or had tripled in price. The new 
rule would require charter operators to have a "substantial number of tickets 
to games in hand" before advertising package tours.

THEATER REVIEW; RUSSIAN STORY OFFERS KIDS IMPORTANT LESSONS; 'THE OVERCOAT,' 
THE POLITICAL SATIRE ABOUT A POOR CLERK WHO NEEDS WARMER GARB, SHOULD APPEAL TO 
PARENTS TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russian literature made simple: an impossible task? Not in the hands of the 
Conejo Players, who are staging an adaptation of Nikolai Gogol's short story 
"The Overcoat" on weekends for their Conejo Afternoon Theater. The show is 
aimed at a young audience, and a crowd of kids who seemed to be 4 to 7 years 
old were laughing throughout Sunday's opening performance. Unlike most 
children's theater, though, "The Overcoat" -- a political satire -- should 
prove appealing to parents as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Gogol's story, adapted for the stage by Tom and Frank Torok, tells of a minor 
clerk in St. Petersburg whose overcoat is too threadbare to face the worst 
winter in eons. He can't afford to buy a new overcoat, but may freeze if he 
doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 During the adventure, youngsters will learn many valuable lessons -- among 
them, the effectiveness of flattery (always a marketable commodity, well into 
adulthood), the frustrations of dealing with a bureaucracy, and the 
inadvisability of wearing fancy new clothes on The Wrong Side of Town. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing the clerk Akaky Akakyavich is Jason Narvy, who may be known to 
youngsters for his portrayal of Skull on the afternoon TV adventure series 
"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers." That's the show whose quick-selling action 
figures were last Christmas' version of the Cabbage Patch Doll phenomenon. 
Narvy turns in a skilled and attractive performance here, one that depends as 
much on pantomime as speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel de la Vega, one of Ventura County's most talented character actors, is 
featured as Gogol, introducing and narrating the story and then stepping in to 
play a number of characters -- a tailor and a medium-ranking bureaucrat among 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Also playing a multitude of parts are Brett Golov, Jeff Scott, Melissa Wotkyns 
and Sara Quick, with Carol Barker appearing as Akakyavich's landlady. All are 
fine, though Golov gets to shine, especially, as the hero's godfather. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toroks' script has fun with the Russian names (though the set designer 
shies away from the Cyrillic alphabet), but shouldn't offend the culturally 
sensitive. Georgeanne Lees' direction is on the spot, with help from Yokav Noy, 
whose name is listed deep in the production staff credits as "mime humorist," 
and Linda Strangio-Hedberg as choreographer. Chad Smith's set design makes good 
use of the stage used for the Players' current evening production of "A View 
From the Bridge," and Elizabeth Holthofer has come up with some nice costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 The play lasts 68 minutes without an intermission -- just on the outer limit 
of what youngsters will tolerate without getting antsy. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "The Overcoat." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Saturdays and Sundays at 2:30 p.m. through Feb. 20.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / COVER STORY; THE SUSPICION IS MUTUAL; LATINOS IN POMONA 
SAY THEY'RE DOCUMENTING THE BORDER PATROL'S ENFORCEMENT TACTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carlos Pleitez, a baby-faced 18-year-old from El Salvador, stood on a Pomona 
street corner one day last year with a few dozen other men hoping for work, his 
green card tucked safely in his wallet. But on this day, the coveted document 
did him little good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had papers with me, but (a federal agent) threw me in the van and took me 
all the way to Riverside," the three-year Pomona resident said of a Border 
Patrol visit to the day labor site about seven months ago. "I said I had 
papers, but they told me, 'Shut up, wetback!' " 
</P>
<P>
 When agents learned his documents were valid, Pleitez was released. But he had 
lost a day's work and had to make his way back from Riverside on his own, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal immigrants throughout the San Gabriel Valley say they increasingly are 
feeling the sting of anti-immigrant backlash alongside their illegal neighbors. 
But nowhere are the sentiments stronger than in Pomona, a Latino-majority city 
and the only one in the valley cruised by the telltale lime-green vehicles of 
the U.S. Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 There, Latinos complain that their businesses have been affected when the 
Border Patrol hangs around; immigrants, legal or not, don't want to go near 
those businesses and risk being questioned, the merchants said. Also, an 
incident in which Border Patrol agents questioned Mayor Eddie Cortez last 
summer quickly became local legend, even though agents insist they stopped 
Cortez because he was following them around. 
</P>
<P>
 The activities of the Border Patrol have created such concern that community 
activists and residents have formed a watchdog organization to educate Pomona 
Latinos about their rights. Members, a few of them here illegally, also walk 
the streets to witness and document Border Patrol sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if you have papers, you feel uneasy," said Juan, 39, who has lived in 
the United States legally for 22 years and has run a small sewing business in 
Pomona for the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan, who is not involved with the watchdog group, declined to give his full 
name, fearing the patrol would raid his business. "You have to go to work and 
you have a certain amount of time to get there. They might stop you just 
because of the way you look," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona is the westernmost part of territory patrolled by agents based in 
Riverside, whose main task is to search for illegal immigrants. While the Los 
Angeles district of the Immigration and Naturalization Service -- the Border 
Patrol's parent agency -- covers a much wider terrain, the INS sets a higher 
priority on arresting illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The harassment goes beyond Pomona, say immigration activists, who are 
receiving increasing numbers of complaints from legal immigrants throughout the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hearing a lot of stories," said Nancy Cervantes of the Coalition for 
Humane Immigration Rights of Los Angeles. "Employers are threatening people, 
'If you're illegal, then you're going to be in a lot of trouble,' and I'm 
talking about legal people who have been here for years." 
</P>
<P>
 A Latina student at Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut recently complained that 
she and her French boyfriend were stopped by immigration officials who checked 
her residency documents. Her boyfriend, in the country illegally, wasn't 
questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 The fear of discrimination is running high among day laborers, many of whom 
are documented workers who gather on the streets to find jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Monrovia, where more than a hundred day laborers sometimes gather at the 
Home Depot on Huntington Boulevard, some who are documented said they have 
increasingly been mistaken for illegal immigrants. As a result, contractors 
offer lower wages or sometimes refuse to pay them at the end of the day, 
assuming they will be afraid to complain to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 And on a recent day in Pomona, one contractor angrily walked away from eager 
laborers, yelling that he wouldn't hire them for fear of being busted by Border 
Patrol agents who were on the scene at the time. But the agents already had 
checked the workers' immigration documents and found them valid. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding day jobs on street corners might soon get harder in unincorporated 
county areas. County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke is proposing an 
ordinance that would prohibit day laborers from seeking work in unincorporated 
county areas, which in the San Gabriel Valley includes Altadena and Hacienda 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ordinance states that day laborers create safety hazards by 
interfering with traffic and clogging sidewalks. But immigration activists and 
day laborers condemn the measure as an attempt to scapegoat immigrants -- legal 
and illegal -- for the region's economic woes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't keep up with all the complaints and calls we get from people saying, 
'Do something about it! I've lost my job. I used to make a good living and now 
they've replaced me with someone who makes minimum wage,' " said Agent In 
Charge Raymond Fuhrmann, who estimated that the Riverside station gets four or 
five calls a day from irate residents eager to report people they believe to be 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Since callers generally cannot verify whether an individual is here legally, 
Fuhrmann suggests they contact police regarding a person's illegal conduct 
rather than his immigration status. But his agents do respond to callers who 
complain about immigrants congregating on street corners, regardless of their 
legal status. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrmann said his officers usually can spot a phony immigration document, but 
he conceded they have on occasion pulled legal immigrants into the Riverside 
office before verifying their documents were valid. 
</P>
<P>
 While Pomona's Latinos say agents stepped up patrols in their city over the 
past year, particularly in the summer and early fall, Fuhrmann said arrests 
have not increased. With just 12 agents to cover 8,000 square miles, more 
arrests would not be possible, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Between October, 1992, and last September, agents from the Riverside station 
arrested 6,421 people -- 937 fewer than the previous year. That difference is 
likely due to tight budgets that cut two agents off the payroll in fiscal 1993, 
Fuhrmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Current statistics for October through the first half of January were 
comparable to the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Latino business owners and day laborers said visits by agents have 
increased, even if arrests haven't. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando Garcia, 22, a legal immigrant from Michoacan, Mexico, said the agents 
come by the Contractor Warehouse on West Mission Boulevard several times a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "They treat us very badly," said Garcia, a resident of Pomona for seven years. 
"When they arrive, they don't ask us whether we have papers or not. They just 
say, 'Hey, wetback!' and sometimes they grab us by the hair." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrmann said he has never seen his officers behave that way. Many are 
compassionate toward the people they arrest, he said, purchasing food and 
drinks or diapers for the children before they board the 4 p.m. daily bus for 
the border. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent day in the city, agents were not hard-pressed to find arrestees. 
As a team of lime-green vehicles and vans cruised Pomona's streets and alleys, 
one man abandoned his car and fled into a house as a woman yelled 'La migra! La 
migra!' from her front yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the day laborers at the site on West Mission Boulevard flashed their 
documents, but more than half a dozen were marched into waiting vans. Within an 
hour, 21 men were apprehended, most of them within Pomona's city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 In any group approached by agents, Fuhrmann said, there are bound to be legal 
residents, particularly in Pomona -- with a Latino-majority City Council and a 
school district whose Latino student population tops 60% 
</P>
<P>
 "It varies. Of 10 people, sometimes half take off running. Sometimes it's only 
one or two," he said, adding that sometimes legal residents run, too, as "a 
joke."  
</P>
<P>
 "When you approach a group like that, there's no way of knowing which is going 
to be illegal, especially if they're recent arrivals, other than by talking to 
them," Fuhrmann said. "But it doesn't take long. Within a few minutes, our 
agents usually know." 
</P>
<P>
 In September, seasoned community activists banded together with newly 
politicized immigrants to form the watchdog Alliance for Immigrant Rights. 
Members walk Pomona's streets on the lookout for the Border Patrol and hand out 
cards emblazoned: "Immigrant: Know Your Rights." 
</P>
<P>
 The group formed shortly after the run-in between Mayor Cortez and Border 
Patrol agents. Cortez was following agents on a sweep through town when he said 
he was pulled over and asked for identification. Cortez, who was driving an old 
pickup truck, said an agent told him he "fit the profile" of an illegal 
immigrant. Border Patrol officials said agents questioned Cortez because they 
considered his behavior unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident spurred rumors in the city and even made the papers in Mexico 
City. It also fueled Pomona's nascent immigrant rights movement. A September 
workshop on Border Patrol issues drew more than 80 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they start asking us for ID and papers, we think they're going to take 
us away. Sometimes we run, out of fear," said Roberto, a legal immigrant who 
attended the workshop to learn about his rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto, who has lived in Pomona since 1984 and supports nine children in 
Mexico, ducked into a hair salon when Border Patrol agents appeared at the day 
labor site recently, rather than face questioning he finds unpleasant and 
frightening. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Castro, 60, who was born in Pomona and has owned Realty World on West 
Mission Boulevard since 1967, said he is more concerned about the real estate 
market than the Border Patrol. But he knows many others feel differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several people have said to me, 'I'm not going to go out in the streets until 
noon or 1 p.m.,' " Castro said. The immigration patrols usually come through 
town in the early morning. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, Norma Y Nico was shopping for pinatas at the Rancho 
Pomona Market when the sight of Border Patrol agents across the street 
paralyzed her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I screamed to my nephew, 'Oh my God! La migra !"' said Nico, who owns 
Pomona's La Lupita meat market.  
</P>
<P>
 Nico and her nephew, both Mexican-born, are here legally. But the specter of 
immigrants fleeing from agents has planted an irrational fear in Nico.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Border Patrol shows up and people start running," Nico said. "They look 
like animals. It makes me feel very bad, because they are my people."

MUSIC; A BAND THAT IS REALLY GNARLY; THE ORANGE COUNTY ROCKERS PLAY A WIDE 
VARIETY OF MUSIC THAT CATERS TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS' LOVE OF DANCING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL LOCEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Much like the Ramones and the Smith Brothers, it's easy to call the Gnarly 
Bros for dinner. The roll call reads Phillip Gnarly on guitar, Tracy Gnarly on 
drums, Bill Gnarly on bass and Brewster Gnarly on keyboards and vocals. You can 
catch all the Gnarlys in the act when they appear at the Calypso in Santa 
Barbara Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Cool, boss, groovy, bitchin', bad and gnarly are not a law firm, just 
different adjectives describing something that is marvelous, wonderful or 
excellent. Adjectives that the Gnarly clearly believe describe their band. 
According to Phillip Gnarly, a fan came up to them during a show, and with all 
the wit and wisdom of a guy who had drank his weight in beer said, " 'You guys 
are gnarly.' There was our name." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hipgnotic" is their album on Tiki Beat Records. Tikis, along with St. 
Christopher medals and woodies invoke images of Southern California 30 years 
ago, or before the Beach Boys invited the nation to join us. 
</P>
<P>
 The current SoCal soundtrack is not Bob Segar or Prince, and Bruce ain't our 
Boss. Rather, the Grateful Dead -- and the new generation of bands that attract 
Deadheads such as Phish, Blues Traveler and the Samples -- along with reggae 
bands, surf music, ska and World Beat music has kept Southern Californians 
dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 "World Beat and reggae music have always been popular here," said Phillip. 
"And surf music is popular in Jamaica. People who live on islands seem to like 
easy, laid-back music. People who live in Southern California, basically, live 
on an island." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gnarly Bros' part of the "island" is Orange County, which has no more 
orange trees, but some good waves and some good bands. Along with Common Sense, 
another band that plays here a lot, the Bros all came from the Laguna 
Beach-Dana Point area. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a large reggae scene in Orange County when I was still in high 
school," Phillip said. "The Rebel Rockers played reggae and ska music even 
before the Untouchables. There were just a lot of bands that played all the 
time down there; then the scene moved to Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 When the guitar player was nearly Gnarly, he was a member of the Bonedaddys, a 
World Beat outfit with a million members that dressed is if every day was 
Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing about this band is that it's a lot smaller than the Bonedaddys," 
Phillip said. "Also, we play straight-ahead rock 'n' roll, and just a wider 
variety of music such as 70s soul music, reggae and funk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bonedaddys had more African styles, and even some New Orleans music. 
World Beat music is just country music from all over the world. The Gnarly Bros 
are not a World Beat band. . . . Our music is very Californian and fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip said the Gnarly Bros came together three years ago when he had to 
throw a band together to play at a club called the Sandpiper in Laguna Beach. 
He called all of the musicians he liked from various other bands, he said, and 
it just worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still play there on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. People that like to 
dance come to see us because we play all types of dance music. It makes me feel 
uncomfortable when people just stand there and stare at us." 
</P>
<P>
 They also play locally once or twice a month at places that encourage people 
to dance funny such as Metro Bay Club in Ventura and the Beach Shack in Santa 
Barbara -- right across the parking lot from the Calypso. 
</P>
<P>
 They've also been as far north as Alaska, south to Mexico and even to Las 
Vegas, where people from Iowa mistake each other for movie stars. They don't 
play much in L.A., however, despite the fact that Phillip lives there and 
spends his days doing session work. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a great L.A. scene, but there's so many bands that play for free that 
it ruins it for the professional bands. A lot of the young bands aren't that 
good, so you have to wade through 20 horrible bands to see one good one. A lot 
of it's pay-to-play or play for free, and we've never done a free gig. Maybe to 
get signed, you need to know the right lawyer." Details

THEATER REVIEW; 31-SONG RODGERS & HART TRIBUTE IS A ROMP DOWN MEMORY LANE; 
WITHOUT THE SAFETY NET OF A PLOT, THE PERFORMERS STAY ADMIRABLY ON TRACK 
THROUGH SOME ABRUPT MUSICAL GEAR SHIFTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You have to understand up front that "Sweet, Smart Rodgers & Hart" is a 
revuerather than a fully staged theatrical event. Calibrate your expectations 
accordingly, and you'll be in good shape to enjoy the charm, painstaking 
research and exceptionally accomplished performances that embellish this 
tribute culled from the canon of more than 650 songs penned during the 1920s 
and '30s by composer Richard Rodgers and his original lyricist, Lorenz Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the safety net of a plot or consistent characters, the four performers 
-- Linda Griffin, Marcia Mitzman, Karen Morrow and Bob Walton -- stay admirably 
on track through some abrupt gear shifts during the evening's 31 songs. Two 
pianos provide the accompaniment -- the rest is all chutzpah. 
</P>
<P>
 For those old enough to recall the Rodgers and Hart era, the show is a 
guaranteed romp down memory lane. 
</P>
<P>
 But the majority of viewers will find it a window into unfamiliar territory, 
since the Rodgers and Hart musicals are not the typical grist for perennial 
revivals by regional musical theater companies -- unlike the later 
collaborations between Rodgers and his second collaborator, Oscar Hammerstein 
II. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Rodgers and Hart weren't innovators. In their time, the team pushed 
the envelope of Broadway musicals in every direction -- from their freewheeling 
reincarnation of Shakespeare's twins from "The Comedy of Errors" as "The Boys 
from Syracuse," to their distinctly untraditional celebration of John O'Hara's 
scam-artist hero in "Pal Joey." 
</P>
<P>
 But the songs in this revue demonstrate how little the team exploited the use 
of song to develop a show's story. In contrast to Hammerstein's lyrics, which 
wedded the singer to the psychological and narrative details of his or her 
character, what's most striking here is the purity of feeling -- whether 
passion in "Isn't It Romantic?" or loneliness in "Little Girl Blue" or 
desperation in "Tell Me I Know How to Love." 
</P>
<P>
 It's precisely that innocent, almost generic outpouring that makes the Rodgers 
and Hart musicals so difficult for contemporary audiences to accept -- we've 
become so acclimated to Sondheimesque emotional complexity and ambivalence that 
their simplicity seems suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the revue format chosen by the show's creator and director, Steven 
Suskin, frees these Rodgers and Hart tunes from the burden of dramatic 
integration, and they're easier to appreciate on their own terms. The songs are 
grouped by theme -- songs of romance, unrequited love, Depression-era struggle, 
etc. -- with occasional biographical narration commendable for its insight as 
well as its brevity. 
</P>
<P>
 The background on the overwhelming sadness and self-loathing that ultimately 
led Hart to abandon the partnership and ultimately life itself brings extra 
poignancy to the material. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the concern as to whether "Sweet, Smart Rodgers & Hart" warrants 
a full-fledged theatrical ticket price is a legitimate one. The affection and 
hard work from those involved are certainly apparent, but the minimal staging, 
limited range and specialized appeal of the piece itself make it better suited 
to an intimate, cabaret-style venue than the expansive (and expensive) Lobero 
Theatre. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Sweet, Smart, Rodgers & Hart" 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Through Feb. 13, Thursdays through Saturdays at 8, Saturday and Sunday 
matinees at 2 p.m.

FOR THE KIDS; LABORS OF LOVE; CLASSES FOR KIDS AND PARENTS HELP THEM CREATE 
CUSTOM VALENTINES

 Love is in the air. You don't feel it yet? OK, so Valentine's Day is still 11 
days away. Now is the time to sign up your kids for one of several classes 
where they can actually make their own valentines. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, make . Sure, they can go to the store and buy a packet of 
valentines featuring Garfield the cat in some smug pose, or Snoopy in a 
love-sick dither. 
</P>
<P>
 But making a valentine for someone -- Mom, Dad, Grandma, a pal -- is so 
special. Those are the creations that get stashed away for keeps. 
</P>
<P>
 "People love getting homemade things," said artist Parmlee Duke, who teaches a 
valentine class for kids through the Pleasant Valley Recreation and Park 
District. It's kind of a lost art that is regaining popularity, she said, 
especially with the push to recycle paper and other stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke's class is on Friday from 4 to 5 p.m. at the Camarillo Community Center, 
1605 E. Burnley St. It's geared for kids 6 to 12 years old and costs $6. For 
registration information, call 482-1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke will show the kids how to make pop-up valentines, the old-fashioned kind 
that originated in Poland. To get the three-dimensional look, the paper is 
folded a certain way before it is cut. (Remember the snowflakes we made as kids 
by cutting folded paper?) 
</P>
<P>
 Duke will have some samples on hand, like the one of the cat that looks like 
it's running, and a Noah's Ark kind of creation with a slit for animals to be 
tucked into. She supplies all the materials for the class -- paper, glue, 
glitter, ribbon, stickers, stencils and envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, at the Carnegie Art Museum, families can participate in a valentine 
workshop Saturday from 10:30 a.m. to noon. The session is part of the Mervyn's 
Family Art Workshops, a program offered on Saturdays at the museum, 424 S. C 
St. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop, taught by artist Jenny Salazar, is for ages 6 and older. 
(Children under 10 must be accompanied by an older family member or friend.) 
The cost is $2 per person for museum members and $3 for non-members. Call 
385-8157 for registration information. 
</P>
<P>
 Salazar said the valentine workshop is a good opportunity for a parent or 
grandparent to sit down with a child and share in an activity. She supplies all 
the materials and lets them create whatever they wish. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members may bring a photo or other memorabilia, and Salazar will show 
them how to incorporate it into the valentine. She'll also show them how to 
take a photocopy of a photograph and tint it with pastels to include in a 
valentine. And she'll explain how to make some of the old-fashioned styles. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura, kids can take a valentine workshop from artist Christina Houlberg 
on Saturday from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at Barranca Vista Recreation Center, 
7050 E. Ralston St. Offered through Ventura's recreation department, the class 
is for kids 6 to 12 years of age. The cost is $12. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also has another Valentine's Day offering. On Feb. 10, artist 
Anne Matsuk will show kids how to make a Valentine's Day gift -- a decorated 
wooden heart for hanging jewelry or kitchen utensils. The class for children, 
ages 5 to 12, runs from 4 to 5 p.m. also at the Barranca Vista center. The cost 
is $8. To register for either class, call 658-4726. 
</P>
<P>
 Gull Wings Children's Museum in Oxnard also has some valentine activities 
lined up. This Saturday at 1 p.m., kids can join a workshop and learn how to 
make valentines. There is no charge for the session with the regular admission 
to the museum, at 418 W. 4th St. 
</P>

FASHION; FORMAL UNIFORMS HAVE WORN OUT THEIR WELCOME; NOW WORKERS TEND TO WEAR 
WHAT'S COMFORTABLE -- JEANS AND SNEAKERS. MILD WEATHER MAKES SHORTS A HIT WITH 
MANY.

 In case you're wondering, the "Repairman" who saves the day for the laundry 
lorn in Maytag TV commercials is not a real-life super-hero. His eight-point 
military cap and bow tie give him away. The guy's a phantom from the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 A service person arriving at your door today is as likely to wear that cap and 
tie as he (or she) is to call you by your last name. Fast-food franchises 
aside, uniform fashions have gone informal. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't think so, look at nuns. Or hair stylists, who have disdained 
their smocks. Or nurses. Once distinguished by the symbolic white cap, nurses 
now whisk bareheaded down hospital halls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been asked many times, 'Are you the real nurse?' " said Susan 
Maccioli, an R.N. at Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "Caps just went by the wayside. The patients like seeing it -- but they just 
weren't practical." 
</P>
<P>
 White dresses are nearly as extinct. In Maccioli's department, intensive care, 
nurses wear teal scrub suits with teal, green and pink lab coats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always say, 'Put three of us together, we look like a shower curtain,' " 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as a former nurse recently told us, "You can't tell a nurse from a 
cleaning lady." 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, potentially: You can't always tell a delivery person from a bandit. 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose you receive a Western Union telegram or money order. There was a time 
when it would be brought by a young man with buzzed hair, a military cap, coat 
and knickers with piping, and shined boots. 
</P>
<P>
 Overkill, you say. But now in Ventura County, the messenger, from a company 
called Go-Between, is an authorized agent of Western Union; and the drivers 
wear jeans and sneakers. (Unless you order a local singing telegram. But, 
that's another story.) 
</P>
<P>
 Most services still retain some formality. Federal Express drivers wear dark 
polo shirts and shorts; you know they're in uniform if you look closely. Postal 
carriers, once decked out in full uniform, hat and badge, now make their 
appointed rounds in optional shorts. On their heads are optional baseball caps, 
pith helmets -- which some like for the rain -- or nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula Postmaster Howard Rivera said the county also has about 20 rural 
carriers who deliver outside the city limits and wear whatever they please -- 
as long it's not short shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County's climate, shorts are a hit with drivers. Our neighborhood 
Chase Brothers Dairy routeman wears them most of the year -- but he's an 
independent contractor. If the company's wholesale supervisor, Frank Redburn, 
had his way, the drivers would look a bit more professional. 
</P>
<P>
 With uniforms, Redburn said, "You get the impression that things are going to 
be uniform. It's an illusion, but you have peace of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 When Redburn started delivering milk 18 years ago, the drivers all wore full 
white uniforms and bow ties. The white military caps had already been retired 
-- as it happens, in 1968, the year of general cultural rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 That classic cap, once a service icon, is almost gone from the uniform scene. 
Its use is down about 95% from a generation ago, according to Ed Sbertoli at 
Midway Cap Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Sbertoli custom-made the cap for Repairman's dramatic TV scenes. In real life, 
he said, baseball-style caps have taken over with uniformed services. Law 
enforcement agencies -- even our own Ventura County sheriffs -- tried them for 
awhile. Most abandoned them again, beginning in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "They found they weren't getting the distinct look that they needed as an 
officer. Guys were saying, 'Well, you had a baseball cap on -- I didn't know 
who the hell you were,' " Sbertoli said. 
</P>
<P>
 One figure closely associated with the eight-point cap was the cab driver. At 
Ventura Cab, spokesman John Datwyler said their drivers rejected the caps and 
uniforms in general when they became independent contractors in the early '80s. 
Personally, he thought it was a poor move. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they wore them, it was easier for them to find fares," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes. 
</P>
<P>
 But, going casual is not entirely uniform, so to speak. A bit of backlash has 
surfaced at Thousand Oaks Cab Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Duesterhoft is buying uniforms for her staff of drivers for the first 
time since the company began in 1960. No caps; but men and women alike will 
wear white shirts, navy blue jackets, navy neckties and trousers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought it would look nicer," said Duesterhoft, who said she sometimes 
has to monitor younger drivers' casual styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, the new, more formal look has not been fully accepted by some of 
her employees, Duesterhoft said, particularly the night drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the sort of concern you'd never hear expressed by Repairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're afraid they are going to get laughed out of the bars," she said.

SHOP TALK; CHOCOLATE PIANOS -- AND OTHER VALENTINE'S GIFTS; FOR THAT SPECIAL 
GUY IN YOUR LIFE, A TOKEN OF ENDEARMENT CAN BE SIMPLE: GET HIM A PRE- SENT HE 
CAN ENJOY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Please, Ventura County women, none of those boxer shorts with hearts on them. 
We know we're speaking for ourselves, but we're willing to bet the majority of 
guys out there would prefer some other token of your affection on Valentine's 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Like maybe a chocolate golf ball. 
</P>
<P>
 We checked out a few gift possibilities for that special (at least on Feb. 14) 
guy in your life. You can go all out, or spend pocket change. It's up to you. 
</P>
<P>
 But remember, it's not always the thought that counts; he'd probably 
appreciate something he actually likes. So, how about chocolate? Guys like 
chocolate as much as anyone. There are any number of heart-shaped boxes of 
assorted chocolates out there. Take your pick. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you want to add that special touch, go to a candy store that takes 
special orders -- where they will mold chocolate into various shapes, like 
cars, computers, something that fits the recipient. These stores will generally 
sell pre-molded chocolates as well. 
</P>
<P>
 At Love at First Bite in Simi Valley, the better all-chocolate gift items 
range from $5 to $100, depending on how much detail goes into them and how much 
chocolate is used. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do personal things," said owner Maggie Urpin. "If somebody's into golf, or 
whatever, they might like a golf bag and golf balls with initials on it. All 
done in chocolate." 
</P>
<P>
 You could spend some bucks on a whole set of clubs. On the other hand, a 
simple, single golf ball, priced at about 75 cents, might suffice. 
</P>
<P>
 At Johanna's Ice Cream and Candy shop in Ventura you can buy your jock husband 
or boyfriend a pre-made chocolate ski set -- two skis, one boot -- for $3.25. 
Or, if he's more the musical type, you can pick him up a pre-made chocolate 
piano for $3.75. And of course, you can put in special orders there too. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of this column, we suggested avoiding underwear. But we've got 
nothing against another old standard: ties. The Broadway in Thousand Oaks is 
selling them for between $14.95 and $29. 
</P>
<P>
 But really, for the money, it's hard to beat thrift shops when you're tie 
hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 We took a stroll down Main Street in Ventura to see what we could dig up. To 
our mild surprise, we found a couple of really nice, stylish tie selections. 
The Retarded Children's Thrift Store was selling ties for 95 cents each. The 
Mission Bargain Center Thrift Store had them for 99 cents per. 
</P>
<P>
 On our tour of the thrifts we stopped at The Coalition Thrift Store, which 
helps support battered women. We couldn't find any ties, but for $1.50 you can 
pick up a recording of Rod McKuen reading poetry. That's pretty romantic. 
</P>
<P>
 Now if that special man in your life is real special -- we mean real special 
-- you may want to make an extra big deal out of Valentine's Day. And we can 
tell you, without hesitation, that most guys would love to be picked up at work 
(or at home, wherever they spend their days) and whisked off to a nearby hotel 
for an evening or two, assuming that there are no major sporting events on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 We checked with two local establishments to see what the going rate is for 
such extravagance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hyatt Westlake Plaza in Westlake Village has a special Valentine's rate 
Feb. 11 through 13 for guests who specifically request it. It will be $79 per 
room for the first night, a savings of $6 off the regular price. If you stay a 
second night during the special offer period, the room is half the discount 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 On Valentine's Day, the hotel's restaurant will serve a five-course dinner 
with a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine. Price: $40 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mandalay Beach Resort in Oxnard is offering its usual Romance Package: For 
$210 per couple you get a room with partial ocean view, choice of a sunset 
dinner for two or gourmet picnic lunch, a gift basket with food items, and a 
complimentary bottle of champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, if it's the champagne you want, you could just drop by Trader 
Joe's, pick up a bottle of Chateau Diana's 1987 Monterey Champagne Blanc de 
Noirs for $5.99, grab a pair of the store's champagne glasses for $1.25 each, 
rent your guy a video, maybe a heart-wrenching sports movie like "Brian's 
Song," and stay at home on Valentine's Day.

COVER STORY: HANGING ROOM ONLY; CLOSET CHAOS HAS BECOME A FACT OF LIFE FOR MANY 
-- BLAME IT ON CONSUMERISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PANCHO DOLL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Look at the calendar. You're now more than a month late on your New Year's 
resolution to clean and organize the closet. Every morning it mocks you and 
your inability to order your life in even the most basic way. 
</P>
<P>
 Household organization is, after all, the oldest occupation in the world. When 
God put Adam in the Garden of Eden, he told him to keep the place straight. The 
task was greatly simplified since Adam and Eve had no clothes and, by 
extension, no closet to fuss with. 
</P>
<P>
 A peek into the tangle that is most people's wardrobe demonstrates the depth 
of humanity's fall from grace. 
</P>
<P>
 "People start piling one thing on top of another and pretty soon they no 
longer realize what they own," said Mary Femino, a veteran closet designer with 
Closet World in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 In an evolutionary sense, we have an excuse because we've had little 
experience organizing closets. As late as the 1940s, the closet was still 
unusual in middle-class homes, said UCSB architectural historian David 
Gebhardt. Before that, most closets were pieces of furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 The wardrobes, chifforobes and armoires that solemnly line the walls in 
antique stores today were part of the cluttered look that characterized 
turn-of-the-century decor. 
</P>
<P>
 When lighter tastes dispatched bulky Victorian furniture and decorations, it 
didn't take long before someone popularized the idea of framing a small part of 
the room, hanging a door on it, and making the clothes disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 "The California bungalow style probably did more to bring clothes closets to 
the masses than anything else," Gebhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
 At about the same time the closet made its general appearance, the United 
States was entering a period of unprecedented consumerism, whipped up by that 
most powerful engine of consumption, the television. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: lots of stuff to put in the closet. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, other areas of home storage were shrinking or disappearing 
altogether. Basements lost ground as contractors tried to make homes more 
affordable, especially in California. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, only 4% of homes have any kind of basement, while the average 
nationwide is 21%, according to the National Housing Survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquakes are the reason. Architects said that the cost of reinforcing 
poured concrete makes it prohibitively expensive for residential construction. 
</P>
<P>
 No basement. More stuff in the closet. 
</P>
<P>
 Walk-in attics are almost as rare. Kevin Karami, an architect who designs 
houses for Pardee Construction, said pre-assembled trusses and hip roofs are 
cheaper and easier to install than gabled roofs, but their low pitch makes them 
little more than crawl spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 No attic. More stuff in the closet. PACKING IT IN 
</P>
<P>
 All of this helps explain why Ventura Councilman Gary Tuttle has pink, plastic 
buttocks on the top shelf of his closet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I built this walk-in when my wife and I got married three years ago," he 
said. "She added lots of stuff when she moved in." 
</P>
<P>
 The butt, he said, was part of her Halloween costume last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle's closet has some similarities to his athletic store. The Inside Track 
on East Main Street in Ventura is so packed with shoes, shorts and warm-up 
suits that there's not enough room to sneeze. 
</P>
<P>
 His closet is only slightly less cramped, due in part to the 200 T-shirts 
stored there. They are a portion of the 1,000 T-shirts that Tuttle estimates he 
owns, mementos of races in which the former world-class runner has 
participated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep the rest out in the garage and rotate them every six months." 
</P>
<P>
 If 1,000 T-shirts seem like an impossible amount, consider the man at the 
other end of the wardrobe spectrum: Petty Officer 2nd Class Stephen Robinson, 
the poster child for sartorial minimalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, a Navy journalist stationed at Point Mugu, has a locker that 
contains little more than five uniforms, the same amount of clothing sailors 
are issued in boot camp. 
</P>
<P>
 All of it is meticulously stored: Socks are neatly stacked; underwear is 
folded facing forward. His dress uniform, the one most people recognize from 
the Cracker Jack box, is stored inside out to protect it from sunlight. 
Dungarees are folded, according to regulation, so they don't have a crease. 
</P>
<P>
 "To fold them you grab them at the crotch and cuff, then snap the seams 
together," he said, demonstrating the technique with a smart pop. 
</P>
<P>
 How do sailors manage with so few clothes? 
</P>
<P>
 "We changed our clothes every other day in the Persian Gulf," Robinson said. 
"Down in Australia, it was maybe once a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Not too many people would be willing to gain closet simplicity at the expense 
of week-old socks. 
</P>
<P>
 But you could gain dominion over your wardrobe by borrowing your 
brother-in-law's table saw and building your own shelving -- given you know the 
difference between a dado joint, a butt joint and the hole in the wall where 
the anchor bolts go. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-cabinetmakers with a strong do-it-yourself impulse can visit stores that 
specialize in modular closet products -- the industry term for those white 
enamel shelves and sliding baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many sizes and shapes, modular products are like Lego for adults. And 
like Lego (a Danish company), the brand names Elfa and Keije suggest that there 
may be some connection between Scandinavians and things that snap together. 
FINDING A NICHE 
</P>
<P>
 America, on the other hand, is the country of origin for the custom closet 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, a young carpenter named Neil Balter found a niche by modifying the 
space-wasting pole-and-shelf design of most closets. His company, California 
Closets formerly based in Woodland Hills, became the largest closet remodeler 
with about 100 franchises worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Seigel owns the California Closets franchise in Newbury Park. He said the 
average price for an eight-foot-wide custom closet is about $600, but you 
certainly could pay more if you add drawer inserts, tie racks and shoe racks. 
</P>
<P>
 Seigel said there are hundreds of options for people who want to simplify 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 If "hundreds of options to achieve simplicity" seems like an oxymoron that 
only the 20th Century could produce, architectural historian Gebhardt said it's 
happened before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Upper class homes in 1870s through the 1890s had drawers, shelving and 
hanging systems every bit as elaborate and inventive as what you can buy 
today," he said. "It's fascinating the role that closets have had 
architecturally and even socially." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe there's a psychological role, as well. Because the closet is a place 
where things are hidden, it seems inevitable that sometime, somewhere a Ph.D. 
candidate will write a dissertation on closets as a psychographic tool for 
evaluating personality. 
</P>
<P>
 Seymour Adler, a New York psychologist whose specialty is understanding 
personality and how it affects behavior in the home, said that a closet's 
orderliness, or lack thereof, can offer insights into aspects of our inner 
selves. Conscientiousness or desire for social acceptance, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 "A person who matches his socks might be detail-oriented and generally careful 
in mechanical activities, or he might be driven by a desire to make a positive 
impression on others, to avoid choosing one navy blue and one black sock by 
accident." 
</P>
<P>
 But are there any repressed desires expressed in the way we store our personal 
garments? Can we draw conclusions about a subject's relationship with his 
mother based on how he stores his socks, whether rolled in fetal position or 
laid one atop another in Oedipal array. 
</P>
<P>
 Do we hang ourselves in effigy each time we hook our shirts on the pole? 
</P>
<P>
 Does organizing pocket change by denominations represent an abhorrence of 
decomposition and ultimately, a denial of death? 
</P>
<P>
 Adler thinks not. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like Freud said: 'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.' " Calling the 
Consultants 
</P>

FAMILY BACKGROUND OF CLUTTER LEADS TO ORDERLY CLOSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PANCHO DOLL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been said that college psychology classes are full of people trying to 
better understand themselves. I don't know if that's true, but it's in that 
spirit of self-examination that I wrote a story on clothes closets. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most people, who wonder why their wardrobe is a mess, I'm puzzled about 
why mine is so straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Hangers all face the same direction. T-shirts and sweat pants are rolled into 
cylinders, each exactly 12 inches long. Running shorts and underwear are rolled 
into cylinders, each exactly six inches long. 
</P>
<P>
 My sock basket alone merits a prescription for tranquilizers. The socks are 
rolled into spheres and stacked pyramid style, like cannonballs at a national 
historic site. 
</P>
<P>
 This, against a family background of cultivated clutter beyond anything a 
closet could contain. 
</P>
<P>
 Our farm was overrun with knickknacks and bric-a-brac purchased for pennies, 
but easily worth twice that amount. The machine shed was strewn with a 
collection of antique clothes irons. The feed shed was stacked with empty 
suitcases. Three legged tables dominated one stall of the horse barn and two 
legged stools filled a corner of the hay barn. 
</P>
<P>
 The low point came when we turned the chickens out of the hen house to make 
space for a room-size cabinet that a defunct lumber store used to hold hundreds 
of different nuts and bolts. Meanwhile we continued keeping our loose hardware 
in coffee cans while coyotes ate the chickens. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensing an error in my family's methodology, I started looking for an 
alternative way of ordering my existence, a task characterized by many 
backpacking trips, some of them months long. I learned two things: 
</P>
<P>
 Clothes like to be stored as a volume, rather than as a plane. Fold them flat 
and they shift around in your backpack, redistributing weight and generally 
resisting order. Roll them into cylinders and they stack neat as cordwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, that Antoine de St. Exupery, author of the "Little Prince," figured it 
out a lot better than I could when he said that a perfect design was not one in 
which there is nothing left to add, but one in which there is nothing left to 
take away. 
</P>
<P>
 In practical terms that meant personal possessions needed for an indefinite 
stay anywhere will total no more than one's body weight (roughly the baggage 
limit on international flights). 
</P>
<P>
 This I learned during the two years that I worked in California and Spain, 
during which time I ricocheted back and forth more times than I remember. My 
desk and dresser was a fiberglass dog cage formerly used to transport a German 
shepherd across the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the kennel, four feet of nylon webbing had the central processing unit 
of my desktop computer snugly suspended near the top. That left just enough 
room underneath for two milk crates, one holding T-shirts rolled into cylinders 
exactly 12 inches long, the other holding shorts rolled into cylinders exactly 
six inches long and socks stacked in a pyramid. PANCHO DOLL

 Plaza Park is Ventura's oldest park -- so old, in fact, that during the 1870s 
and 1880s livestock grazed on its 3.6 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how old, you ask? The downtown park shows up on the fledgling city's 
first official map in 1869. 
</P>
<P>
 These and many other historical tidbits about the park and the surrounding 
neighborhood will be shared by historian Richard Senate during a city-sponsored 
tour Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The hourlong walk begins at 11 a.m. at the park, bounded by Thompson Boulevard 
and Santa Clara, Chestnut and Fir streets. The cost is $4 for adults and $3 for 
seniors and children under 12. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're impressed by those lofty, old Moreton Bay fig trees, Plaza Park has 
a real gem. Planted in 1874, the tree rises more than 70 feet and has a spread 
of 128 feet. According to Senate, it's one of the state's oldest and largest. 
</P>
<P>
 The park has also attracted some lofty figures during its history. On a 
campaign swing to the West Coast, Theodore Roosevelt stumped for the presidency 
at the park. 
</P>
<P>
 And bandleader John Philip Sousa put in an appearance back when brass band 
concerts in the park were all the rage, Senate said. At that time the park 
sported a gazebo, which was torn down just before World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The park's most historic relic is a bronze cannon that never saw action on U. 
S. soil. In fact, the cannon originated about 200 years ago in Manila, in the 
Philippines, in a foundry run by Spanish priests. It was inscribed "San 
Buenaventura," apparently named for the newly founded mission here. 
</P>
<P>
 The cannon was mounted at Fort Santiago in Manila to protect the local harbor. 
It remained there until 1898, when it was captured by American forces during 
the Spanish-American War. It was junked in a military scrap pile in San Pedro 
until a Ventura city official spotted it in 1902, Senate said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The City Council requested that the Navy give it to the city, and it arrived 
in 1903," he said. "Almost no one knows it was used to defend the city of 
Manila." Today it serves as a memorial to all soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate's tour includes a look at the historic Mitchell block, those Victorian 
brick homes that border the park on Thompson Boulevard. Perhaps the most 
striking is the original home of Mary Mitchell, a three-story building with a 
tower in the center that combines a number of architectural styles. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour also takes in the mural in the post office, next to the park on Santa 
Clara Street. Painted by Gordon Grant, the stark, bleak mural of local farmers 
and ranchers was a WPA (Works Progress Administration) project painted in 1936.

AT THE MARKET: COOKED OR COLD, KOHLRABI HAS VARIETY OF DISTINCTIVE FLAVORS; THE 
WINTER HARVEST OF THE BULBOUS, TURNIP- LIKE VEGETABLE PROMISES 'HIGH-QUALITY 
STUFF' AT REASONABLE PRICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Kohlrabi is a German word for "cabbage turnip." Not exactly a term that 
conjures up culinary delight. Nonetheless, this vegetable oddity is worthy of 
some attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulbous plant -- although a member of the cabbage family -- is not a 
hybrid of that veggie, as its German translation might suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 And though it appears to be a root, its turnip-shaped, enlarged stem actually 
grows above ground. This swollen stem -- ranging in size from a golf ball to a 
tennis ball -- is encased in a fibrous skin similar to that of broccoli stalks. 
Sprouting out of this portion of the plant are numerous lengthy, collard-like 
leaves that are also edible. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the skin has been pared back, you'll find a crisp flesh that is juicier 
and more delicate than any turnip you'll come across. Eaten raw or cooked, 
kohlrabi bulbs are defined by a variety of mild, yet distinct, flavors. In its 
raw state, you'll taste hints of sweetness, radish and broccoli stem flavors. 
Its leaves offer a kale-collard flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant is available most of the year and is raised in two versions -- pale 
green and violet. The flavors and texture do not vary between the two, said 
Marco Chan, sales manager of Brostoff-Celle, a large distributor of kohlrabi. 
</P>
<P>
 "Supplies are better during the spring and summer," Chan said, "but the winter 
harvest is normally high-quality stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Current prices are certainly reasonable. A bunch of four medium-size bulbs -- 
bushy leaves attached -- is going for about $1.50. You'll find kohlrabi at most 
supermarkets and gourmet markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Popular in European communities, kohlrabi has remained a little-used product 
in the United States, though it has its core of faithful enthusiasts, according 
to the Fresh Produce Council, a Los Angeles-based industry trade group. 
</P>
<P>
 Its versatility might surprise you. The peeled raw bulbs can be sliced, diced 
or julienned and added to salads and stir fry. Steamed kohlrabi can be 
marinated in a vinaigrette and served alone or tossed into a salad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kohlrabi is kind of a hit-and-miss thing," said Ruben Mondragon, produce 
manager at Mrs. Gooch's Natural Foods in Thousand Oaks. Mondragon said kohlrabi 
is a good seller at their Los Angeles area stores, "but here it's popular with 
only a handful of customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Educating and familiarizing the public is key, Mondragon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've tried (demonstrations) in the store to show people how to use it in 
soups and other recipes," he said. "But it's been kind of tough getting it to 
catch on." 
</P>
<P>
 For a simple vegetable side dish, shred the peeled bulbs coarsely with a food 
processor or hand grater. Saute for a few minutes in a little olive oil or 
butter until desired tenderness is reached. Season simply with salt and pepper 
or embellish with your favorite herbs and spices. (A lemon-herb seasoning we 
tried in the preparation produced a delicious result.) 
</P>
<P>
 Vegetable soup lovers should give kohlrabi a try. Toss the cubed or diced 
bulbs into your usual recipe or puree it to thicken soups, stews and sauces. 
</P>
<P>
 When purchasing kohlrabi, look to the leaves for a fresh, healthful 
appearance, which are free of yellowing, said Fillmore kohlrabi grower Ken 
Rogers Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 When storing the vegetable, be sure to separate the stalks and leaves from the 
bulbs and refrigerate separately in a plastic bag. This will prolong freshness. 
Details 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Kohlrabi, a member of the cruciferous family, is an ideal nutritional 
addition to your diet. The plant, including the bulbs and leaves, is an 
excellent source of vitamins A and C. You'll also benefit from its high fiber 
content and low calories.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; THE EARLIER THE BETTER AT OTANI'S; THE SEAFOOD IS FRESH, BUT 
THE PREDOMINANTLY DEEP-FRIED FARE GETS HEAVIER AS THE DAY PROGRESSES. 
</P>

<P>
 Lunch is the best meal at Otani's Tempura-Ya Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Otani's dishes -- many of which are deep-fried -- tend to get a bit heavy as 
the day wears on. Besides, it is quite cozy to sit at the six-seat counter, 
sipping a paper cup of Budweiser ($1 on tap) and waiting for a plate of fish, 
oysters, clams or shrimp, while the midday Oxnard sun streams in through the 
storefront windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, the salads seem to get just a little bit soggy and the oils 
and the breading are not as light or as fresh as they were in those lunchtime 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 You're not looking at a ritzy restaurant, but a neighborhood place with a 
consistent clientele. And it's nice to see the Otani family bustling around 
behind the counters. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a combination restaurant and seafood market, with catfish, oysters, 
shrimp, squid and a variety of other denizens of the deep displayed on ice in 
the cases on two sides of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 The place is cavernous, its high ceilings sporting industrial beams, and the 
booths are the traditional orange plastic ones. On the wall behind the counter, 
the menu is written on long sheets of butcher paper. 
</P>
<P>
 The place doesn't look as if it has changed much since the Otani family 
started running it more than 40 years ago. Four generations have been involved 
in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Stick with the seafood, which is fresh. Items like the teriyaki chicken 
($4.98) or the teriyaki hamburger ($2.89) are not what you'd come here for. 
</P>
<P>
 And even the seafood -- with the preponderance of fried items on the menu -- 
can be a bit heavy. But earlier in the day, when the oil is still light and 
golden, the deep-fried seafood plates are hearty and filling. The thick 
breading is a Japanese bread-crumb mixture called panko.  
</P>
<P>
 The oyster plate, as an example, offers large, plump oysters ($4.98), and 
plenty of them. On the side are rice, tempura-fried vegetables and a salad, 
which comes with nearly every meal. It consists of tossed greens, with some 
cabbage, lots of onions and a creamy garlic dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 The tempura combo ($4.98) comes as lots of softly cooked fish and shrimp, 
fried, with the vegetables, rice and salad on the side. 
</P>
<P>
 Still looking toward the fried side of the menu, the clams and shrimp ($4.98) 
come with all of the same fixings. The shrimp is all right, but the clams -- 
actually clam strips -- are an overcooked version of those that helped make the 
Howard Johnson restaurants famous. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most interesting dish on the menu is the Japanese taco ($3.25). 
Although the description says it's filled with fish, the one I ate seemed to 
have some shrimp in it. It is a deep-fried egg roll skin, sort of folded in 
half, and stuffed with fish (shrimp?) and vegetables such as celery and bell 
pepper, onions and carrots, with flavoring of ginger and soy. 
</P>
<P>
 If deep-fried, breaded seafood is not your thing, then what the butcher paper 
menu sheets refer to as the "diet special ($6.95)" may be. It can be albacore 
or swordfish, but the mahi-mahi -- a generous, tender, firm piece of fish that 
comes broiled, with a teriyaki sauce -- was perhaps the best dish at Otani's.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; RAIDERS INVITED TO OAKLAND; FOOTBALL: TEAM SAYS 
IT HASN'T TALKED OF MOVING FROM DAMAGED COLISEUM. ALAMEDA COUNTY DENIES IT IS 
TRYING TO RECAPTURE THE FRANCHISE. 
</P>

<P>
 Oakland authorities Wednesday extended a written invitation to the Los Angeles 
Raiders to play next fall in the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum if the 
earthquake-damaged Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum cannot be repaired in time for 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Alameda County Supervisor Don Perata said the invitation was not part of an 
attempt to bring the Raiders back to Oakland on a permanent basis, but was an 
offer of assistance during a time of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to appear to be doing anything other than offering assistance 
the same way people offered us assistance after the '89 earthquake," Perata 
said. "We're not trying to profit from someone else's misery." 
</P>
<P>
 Perata's remarks, however, drew a caustic retort from the new president of the 
Los Angeles Coliseum Commission, Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke. 
</P>
<P>
 "He says he's doing us a favor," said Burke. "Some favor! " 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said she would call Oakland Mayor Elihu Harris to get a further 
explanation of what Oakland was doing. Several years ago, Oakland made a 
determined but ultimately unsuccessful attempt to win back the Raiders, who had 
moved to Los Angeles in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Raiders, meanwhile, issued a "categorical denial" of 
reports broadcast on some stations Wednesday that the team is talking to 
Oakland about a possible move there for the next season, or, as one report 
said, has already reached an agreement in principle to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 The team spokeswoman, who declined to be identified by name, called all such 
reports "Alice in Wonderland" and "a cockamamie story." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Raider Executive Assistant Al LoCasale said that the team 
was waiting for reports from structural engineers on the Coliseum damage. In 
the meantime, he said, the Raiders had not put out feelers to anyone -- not to 
Oakland or Dodger Stadium or the Rose Bowl, which are possible local playing 
alternatives to the Coliseum next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Wednesday, the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission unanimously approved a 
motion giving the team six more months before it would have to commit itself to 
playing in the stadium next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the collapse in 1992 of a major plan to renovate the Coliseum, putting 
in a second deck and luxury boxes, the team's lease to play in the stadium has 
been on a year-to-year basis, Coliseum officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under this arrangement, the team is normally given only 30 days after playing 
its last game of one season to commit itself to the next, a timetable that 
would have given the Raiders only one more week to make such a commitment for 
1994, perhaps even before the structural engineer's report on quake damage 
would be received. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Coliseum Commission action gives both the commission and the team 
time to see what the total damage is, whether federal grants and other funds 
can be obtained to repair it, and just how long the repairs will take. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, whose football team also plays in the Coliseum, has also said it is 
awaiting results of inspections of quake damage before exploring alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke on Wednesday said the damage is so extensive that the work ought to be 
called a "reconstruction" of the 71-year-old stadium rather than a "repair." 
But she and others said they were not giving up on the hope of finishing the 
job by the start of the football season. 
</P>
<P>
 With Burke leading the way, the commission quickly voted to retain consultants 
who are expert in obtaining money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, 
and to set up a special earthquake committee to deal with the manifold problems 
of reopening the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's project director for recent Coliseum renovations, Don C. 
Webb, reported that substantial demolition on at least upper levels would be 
needed before the quake damage could be corrected, and he said it is possible 
that the alluvial fill on which the stadium is built would need to be reworked. 
Webb said the work would cost at least $33 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also voted to authorize another $330,000 in earthquake repairs 
to the Sports Arena, on top of $112,000 in emergency repairs made before the 
facility was reopened Saturday. And it directed that federal financing be 
sought to make another $800,000 to $900,000 in repairs to the arena, home of 
the Clippers and USC basketball teams, that eventually will be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 As the commission met Wednesday, a controversy raged over whether a 1991 
report by its principal structural engineer, which said the Coliseum walls did 
not meet current seismic safety codes and would be seriously damaged in a 
magnitude 7.0 quake, should have been turned over to the commission by the 
Spectacor Management Group, the company that manages the Coliseum and Sports 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was finally delivered to commissioners at the end of the meeting 
Wednesday, and when she read it Burke said she felt that it should have been 
delivered in 1991, at least to key commissioners charged with supervising 
Coliseum renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a normal thing to turn it over to them," Burke said. "I can't 
imagine why it wasn't turned over. It is strange. Spectacor had nothing to gain 
or lose by not passing it on." 
</P>
<P>
 Two Spectacor officials, the present Coliseum general manager, Jay Hagerman, 
and the prior manager, Peter Luucko, who was performing the duty in 1991, both 
explained Wednesday that the report by engineer Nabib Youssef was generally 
prepared in the context of work that was to be done on the projected massive 
renovation that never took place. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, they said, it had been directed to the Coliseum's architects, HNTB in 
Kansas City, and only a copy was given to Spectacor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The executive summary of the report stated that the structural system of the 
existing Coliseum included "ordinary" concrete when both the Uniform Building 
Code and the Los Angeles City Building Code "prohibit the use of ordinary 
concrete frames in regions of high seismicity." The stadium, however, was built 
before those standards were in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Youssef's report went on to say that during a "maximum credible level 
earthquake," a magnitude 8.3 on the San Andreas Fault, or a 7.0 on the nearby 
Newport-Inglewood Fault, there would be "damage to longitudinal beams . . . 
considerable damage to transverse beams . . . and localized damage at base and 
top of columns." 
</P>
<P>
 All of these kinds of damage occurred at the Coliseum on Jan. 17, when a 
smaller quake, the magnitude 6.6 Northridge temblor, struck an area farther 
from the stadium than the Newport-Inglewood Fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Paddock reported from San Francisco and Reich from Los Angeles.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; RAIL RIDERSHIP DROPS AS COMMUTERS RETURN TO 
ROADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Average daily ridership on the Metrolink commuter trains dropped 30% this 
week, disappointing mass-transit advocates who hoped the earthquake might 
motivate commuters to permanently relinquish their cars.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials, who said they anticipated the decline but hoped it would be more 
gradual, attributed the lower ridership to recent openings of better freeway 
detours.  
</P>
<P>
 At its peak, ridership on the commuter trains soared to a record high of 
31,276 daily passengers last week. More than two-thirds of the riders were 
Santa Clarita Valley residents who bypassed quake-damaged freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, however, Santa Clarita ridership fell by 40%, to 13,149 from nearly 
22,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's natural that people would want to see what the commute (on freeways) is 
like right now," said Richard Stanger, executive director of Metrolink. "It was 
obvious that people were going to try the roads again." 
</P>
<P>
 For the year-old rail system, the throngs of travelers still represent a boon 
in post-quake ridership as well as publicity. In December, for instance, about 
10,500 passengers rode the periwinkle-and-white trains on an average day; of 
those, only 1,439 rode the Santa Clarita line. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we thought three weeks ago that we'd be up to carrying 13,000, we would 
have been dancing in the street," Stanger said. "It's a tremendous gain in 
ridership." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar fluctuations in ridership were experienced in the weeks after the 1989 
Loma Prieta earthquake on Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) trains. After that 
earthquake, ridership reached an all-time high of 357,000, up from the average 
pre-earthquake ridership of 210,000. But BART, too, suffered a disappointing 
drop of about 100,000 riders when the San Francisco-Oakland Bridge reopened 
after it had been shut one month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we weren't going to keep all those riders because we knew that the 
bridge would open," said BART spokeswoman Vicki Wills. "We were just hoping we 
would keep more than we did. But they found another route -- the automobile. 
It's a shame." 
</P>
<P>
 Urban planners say ridership on the Metrolink will probably mimic the pattern 
of BART. But fluctuations may continue as commuters continue trying out 
different methods of reaching their jobs -- train, bus, car pool and driving 
solo. Patterns of behavior are affected by employers, who in some cases are 
demonstrating a newfound flexibility, offering more accommodating work hours or 
allowing people to work at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in a period of tremendous flux and experimentation," said Genevieve 
Giuliano, associate professor of urban and regional planning at USC. "For those 
who experimented with the train and found problems, they have probably moved on 
to other things." 
</P>
<P>
 In the days after the Jan. 17 quake, which damaged portions of six freeways, 
Metrolink officials had an all but captive audience along the Santa Clarita 
train line. But last weekend, Caltrans opened shorter, vastly improved detours 
around the Golden State Freeway.  
</P>
<P>
 At its worst, motorists suffered delays last week of more than two hours as 
they attempted to navigate the Golden State-Antelope Valley freeway interchange 
during rush hour. By contrast, on Monday, with additional detour lanes open, 
the delay around the interchange had shrunk to seven minutes, said Caltrans 
spokesman Russell Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to diminish additional ridership dips, Metrolink officials are 
attempting to better their service in the months ahead, hoping to carve off 10% 
of travel time, Stanger said. On the newly opened tracks from Lancaster to 
Union Station, for instance, the 78-mile trip takes two hours and 25 minutes. 
By June, the trip should take 40 minutes less as workers improve the old 
freight tracks, which have slowed trains to speeds of as little as 35 m.p.h. 
along certain sections, Stanger said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Los Angeles County transportation officials also approved a 
two-for-one monthly deal for passengers from the Santa Clarita and Antelope 
valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the motion unanimously adopted by the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority board, Metrolink passes bought by north county commuters for February 
will be valid through March as well.  
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the earthquake, we have a captured audience here," MTA board 
member Mel Wilson said. "Let's not gouge the captured audience. Let's help them 
where we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink officials opened new stations in Palmdale, Lancaster and Acton after 
the quake. But some new riders have complained about ticket prices. Currently, 
a monthly Metrolink pass for travel into downtown Los Angeles from the Santa 
Clarita Valley costs $144 and $208 from the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Some passengers have said they were led to believe the 2-for-1 special was 
already in place when they purchased their passes. Metrolink officials traced 
the confusion to a bureaucratic tangle. Although Metrolink officials approved 
the idea of a discount two weeks ago, the reduction had still to be ratified by 
the MTA on behalf of Los Angeles County as the affected area. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, MTA board members also approved $316 million for the 
construction of 85 miles of new car pool lanes over the next three years, 
including several projects on San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope Valley 
freeways. Car-pool lanes are scheduled to be built on sections of the Ventura, 
Antelope Valley, Hollywood, Simi Valley and San Diego freeways, in addition to 
other locations throughout the county.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; OPEN FOR THE MEMORIES; RECOVERY: EMPLOYEES OF 
PIZZERIA UNO RETURN TO WORK IN TRIBUTE TO THEIR BOSS, WHO DIED IN THE QUAKE. IT 
IS THE FIRST BUSINESS TO REOPEN IN NORTHRIDGE FASHION CENTER.

 The employees at Pizzeria Uno in Northridge came to work Wednesday and opened 
the place for business, but it wasn't for the paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 They did it for Adam Slotnick. In memory of their former boss, who died in the 
quake -- and as part of an unspoken way of getting on with their lives -- the 
employees rallied to become the first shop in the badly damaged Northridge 
Fashion Center to open since the Jan. 17 temblor. On that morning, part of 
their mall collapsed for all the world to see, and it became a symbol of the 
damage wrought in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the restaurant's employees were refugees from the Northridge 
earthquake, with damaged apartments and lost possessions. But they started 
showing up for cleanup duty the first day without really saying why. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of everyone being down, they all came in and volunteered to help," 
said general manager Keith Ishibashi. "It's been a healing process." 
</P>
<P>
 As they work, talk always seems to turn to Slotnick. At 27, he wasn't the 
oldest victim of the quake or the youngest, noteworthy neither for his heroism 
nor his folly. He was a just a nice guy, they say, a recent East Coast 
transplant trying to make friends and to make it up the career ladder at the 
close-knit restaurant chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "For myself, if I dwelled on the loss of a good friend without replacing it 
with fond memories, it leaves an empty spot and an empty feeling," Ishibashi 
said. "When you stay busy at a restaurant where he worked hard, it brings back 
fond memories." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the money," he said. "It's what Adam would want." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if the mall was a focal point of the disaster, Ishibashi and other 
Uno's employees said, they also wanted it to be a visible sign of the recovery, 
proving that Angelenos can dust themselves off and get on with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrapped in their work once more Wednesday, some said they could almost forget 
the quake and kept expecting to hear Slotnick's familiar voice. "I'm still 
feeling that today; waiting for him to come around the corner," said Lori 
Rudolph, 27, as she worked the bar. "And it's just not going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 After snooping around for an hour Wednesday afternoon, a Fire Department 
inspector gave the restaurant permission to open, even though a tag remained 
telling customers the mall is closed. He warned Ishibashi to keep the 
looky-loos away from the construction next door, where workers were trying to 
shore up the damaged Broadway. On the other side of Pizzeria Uno is the 
Bullock's store, which all but imploded. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the doors opened, several customers were eating deep-dish pizza or 
having a midday cocktail. Some were construction workers fixing the mall, which 
is expected to open in July. For others returning to their favorite lunch 
haunt, just being able to sit in a familiar Naugahyde booth was a small but 
welcome consolation in a world of drastic changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost so much. It's really comforting that the restaurant is still 
here," said Judy Palmer, who works in security at the Broadway. "It's like 
family. We're friends with everyone here." 
</P>
<P>
 When Slotnick failed to show up the morning of the quake, some employees 
rushed to the ill-fated Northridge Meadows complex where he lived in a 
ground-floor apartment. Amy Barcellos was one of those there when firefighters 
pulled him out of the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire chief said he died instantly," Barcellos said, "that he didn't 
suffer any pain." 
</P>
<P>
 That pain, employees said, was saved for those who worked with Slotnick. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an unspoken feeling," said hostess Mary LaRouche, 60, "that even 
though we're stronger for going through this together, that Adam isn't with us 
anymore. But you have to get back doing something, or you're scared."

FBI INVESTIGATING POLICE SLAYING OF WOMAN; VIOLENCE: CIVIL RIGHTS INQUIRY WILL 
FOCUS ON DEC. 16 DEATH OF SONJI DANESE TAYLOR, WHO WAS SHOT REPEATEDLY BY LAPD 
OFFICERS DURING A ROOFTOP CONFRONTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The FBI has opened a civil rights investigation into the fatal shooting of a 
woman Dec. 16 by Los Angeles police officers who confronted her on a hospital 
rooftop, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've instituted a preliminary investigation into allegations of a civil 
rights violation in the death of Sonji Danese Taylor," said Special Agent John 
L. Hoos, a spokesman for the FBI's Los Angeles field division. "When it is 
completed, results of the preliminary investigation will be forwarded to the 
Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division." 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI is at least the third agency to become involved in the investigation 
of the shooting -- in which Taylor received 10 bullet wounds, seven of them in 
the back. The Los Angeles County district attorney's office also is 
investigating, as is the LAPD's officer-involved shooting unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of officer-involved shootings or other uses of force by 
police officers are investigated without the involvement of the FBI, but 
federal agents can open a civil rights investigation if they learn of an 
incident and believe it merits at least a preliminary inquiry. Many 
investigations are sparked by complaints, but in this case, news reports about 
the shooting prompted the FBI to open its preliminary probe. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI officials would not comment Wednesday on the specifics of the Taylor case. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD officials also have declined comment in detail, except to confirm that 
they are investigating, as is typical in any shooting involving a police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The department fully intends to conduct a thorough investigation, which will 
be forwarded to the chief of police and from him to the Police Commission," 
LAPD Cmdr. David J. Gascon said Wednesday. "At the same time, we recognize the 
authority of other entities to examine such events." 
</P>
<P>
 Gascon, a spokesman for the Police Department, said the LAPD opened its 
investigation shortly after the shooting. The results of that investigation, he 
added, will become public once Chief Willie L. Williams transmits them to the 
Police Commission. Neither Gascon nor other police officials would predict how 
long the LAPD inquiry might take. 
</P>
<P>
 In the incident under review, security guards from the St. Vincent Medical 
Center called police after discovering Taylor, 27, on the hospital roof. Police 
say she was holding a butcher knife in her left hand and her 3-year-old son in 
her right, and that she was shouting "For the blood of Jesus!" 
</P>
<P>
 Officers used pepper spray on Taylor, and said later that the gas caused her 
to drop the child. But, according to police, Taylor continued to threaten them 
with the knife. When she refused to drop it, LAPD officials say the officers 
fired nine shots while a number of witnesses looked on. 
</P>
<P>
 A coroner's report found that Taylor had been shot 10 times -- though one shot 
may have passed through her hand and struck her body again. Of the 10 gunshot 
wounds, seven hit Taylor in the back, a finding that angered Taylor's family 
and her lawyer, Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., who hinted Tuesday that race may have 
been a factor in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The two police officers involved in the shooting -- Sgt. Michael Long and 
Officer Craig Liedahl -- are white. Taylor was black. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran was unavailable for comment Wednesday, but Taylor's grandmother, 
Bobbie McDonald, said she was heartened by the FBI's interest in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't think this was right," McDonald said. "These police officers 
are supposed to be trained to save people's lives. They sprayed her, and then 
they still shot her. How can that be right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although FBI agents will not comment on how they intend to investigate the 
case, civil rights inquiries typically proceed immediately, regardless of what 
other agencies are involved. In most cases, the federal government defers to 
local authorities when it comes to a possible prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 That was what happened, for instance, in the March 3, 1991, beating of Rodney 
G. King. The district attorney's office prosecuted its case first in state 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only after the officers were found not guilty there that federal 
authorities reopened their investigation and eventually prosecuted the same 
officers in federal court. On April 17, 1993, Sgt. Stacey C. Koon and Officer 
Laurence M. Powell were convicted of violating King's civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finding that police officers violated federal civil rights laws does not 
require that prosecutors prove they acted out of racial malice. In cases such 
as the Taylor shooting, agents generally focus on the allegation that officers 
intentionally used more force than was necessary -- in violation of the 
victim's right to be safe from the intentional use of excessive force by 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 That right is guaranteed by the 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

NORTH COUNTY COMMUTERS ON METROLINK GET 2-FOR-1 DEAL; TRANSIT: PASSES BOUGHT BY 
SANTA CLARITA AND ANTELOPE VALLEY RIDERS FOR FEBRUARY WILL BE VALID THROUGH 
MARCH. THE GOAL IS TO RETAIN NEW PASSENGERS. 
</P>

<P>
 In a gesture to new Metrolink riders following the Northridge earthquake, Los 
Angeles County transportation officials Wednesday approved a 2-for-1 monthly 
deal for passengers from the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the motion unanimously adopted by the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority board, Metrolink passes bought by north county commuters for February 
will also be valid through March. Ridership from those communities has soared 
since the Jan. 17 temblor, which prompted thousands of motorists to turn to the 
trains for relief from bottlenecked freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the earthquake, we have a captured audience here," MTA board 
member Mel Wilson said. "Let's not gouge the captured audience. Let's help them 
where we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Average daily ridership on Metrolink has already dropped as Caltrans officials 
have opened up more lanes of the Antelope Valley Freeway and as commuters find 
alternate routes to Los Angeles, such as Angeles Crest Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuter train ridership dropped 30% this week, disappointing mass-transit 
advocates who had hoped that the earthquake might persuade commuters to 
permanently relinquish their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they anticipated the drop-off but hoped that it would be more 
gradual. At its peak, ridership on the commuter trains soared to a record high 
of 31,276 daily passengers last week. More than two-thirds of the riders were 
Santa Clarita Valley residents who bypassed quake-damaged freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, however, Santa Clarita ridership fell by 40%, to 13,149 from nearly 
22,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's natural that people would want to see what the commute (on freeways) is 
like right now," said Richard Stanger, executive director of Metrolink. "It was 
obvious that people were going to try the roads again." 
</P>
<P>
 For the year-old rail system, the throngs of travelers still represent a boon 
in post-quake ridership as well as publicity. In December, about 10,500 
passengers rode the periwinkle-and-white trains on an average day; of those, 
only 1,439 rode the Santa Clarita line. 
</P>
<P>
 As for keeping the new Metrolink riders on the trains, MTA officials said 
Wednesday that the 2-for-1 discount would be a good marketing tool that might 
also attract new customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some new riders have complained about ticket prices and asked transportation 
officials to take into account the lower income levels of many north county 
residents. Currently, a monthly Metrolink pass for travel into downtown Los 
Angeles from the Santa Clarita Valley costs $144 and $208 from the Antelope 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot afford $208" every month, Palmdale City Councilman David Myers told 
the MTA board Wednesday. He said the transit board's action would answer the 
question of "whether the board wants to make Metrolink service to the Antelope 
Valley work." 
</P>
<P>
 Other passengers have said they were led to believe that the 2-for-1 special 
was already in place when they purchased their passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink officials traced the confusion to a bureaucratic tangle. Although 
Metrolink officials approved the idea of a discount two weeks ago, the 
reduction had still to be formally ratified by the MTA for Los Angeles County 
riders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Transportation Commission will decide the same issue Friday 
for riders on the Moorpark Metrolink line. 
</P>
<P>
 In approving the Santa Clarita/Antelope Valley discount, MTA directors went 
against recommendations by their staff members not to offer a fare reduction. 
Staff analysts warned that while federal disaster relief funds could subsidize 
the difference between full- and half-price passes for new passengers, the MTA 
would have to cover the gap for discounted passes bought by pre-existing riders 
-- about $200,000 in all. 
</P>
<P>
 But directors dismissed the $200,000 as not too significant. And to address 
concerns over fairness, the board passed an amendment authorizing the MTA to 
issue free bus vouchers, good for a month, to residents in emergency shelters 
who have qualified for some type of federal disaster aid. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, board members approved $316 million for the construction of 
new car-pool lanes over the next three years, including several projects on San 
Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope Valley freeways. Car-pool lanes are 
scheduled to be built on sections of the Ventura, Antelope Valley, Hollywood, 
Simi Valley and San Diego freeways, in addition to other sites throughout the 
county.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; HIGH SCHOOL TO BE SHUT AT LEAST A MONTH; 
EDUCATION: PARENTS REACT ANGRILY TO THE DELAY. STUDENTS AT A GRANADA HILLS 
SCHOOL WILL RELOCATE IN TWO WEEKS. 
</P>

 Students at an earthquake-damaged elementary school in Granada Hills will be 
able to enroll in a nearby middle school in two weeks, parents learned 
Wednesday -- but students at El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills will 
be out for at least four weeks and may not be back in their usual classrooms 
until April. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting attended by more than 1,000 parents and students Wednesday night, 
parents reacted with outrage to the news of the expected long delay in 
reopening El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified School District officials said they plan to bring in 50 
portable classrooms at a cost of $5 million to resume classes in about four 
weeks, hoping they will bridge the gap until repairs to the school's buildings 
can be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take until at least April 1 to repair quake damage to the school's 
three main buildings, which hold 120 classrooms and the main office, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The alternative plans I just heard tonight are not acceptable," said Ike 
August, whose daughter is a senior at the high school. "The federal government 
in two days was able to shelter thousands of people -- we're talking about 
April." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of students at Van Gogh Street Elementary School received somewhat 
more optimistic news earlier in the day. School officials said their children's 
classes will be resumed at nearby Frost Middle School within the next two weeks 
while a study is begun to determine if the soil beneath the Van Gogh Street 
school is stable. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura Chick and school board member Mark Slavkin 
-- who had announced his candidacy for the state Assembly earlier in the day -- 
pledged to try to speed up the process, but could offer no alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can brainstorm, but we will proceed with the bungalow plan until a 
workable plan emerges," Slavkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students from John F. Kennedy and El Camino high schools will be permitted to 
enroll in nearby high schools provided there is room, said Dick Browning, the 
district's director of high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Doug Brown, the Los Angeles Unified School District's 
director of facilities, told a group of about 150 Van Gogh parents that while 
inspectors have declared their school building structurally sound, deep 
fissures that cracked the school's floors could indicate a more serious soil 
problem. A study of the soil problem could take as long as three months, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Gogh's 370 students will be relocated to Frost as soon as that school's 26 
damaged classrooms can be restored, Brown said. The district is also exploring 
the possibility of using portable classrooms at the Frost campus, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost Principal Jay Peterman, who also attended an afternoon meeting with Van 
Gogh parents, said his school can hold 2,000 students and has an enrollment of 
1,300. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents expressed concern about when -- and if -- their school would reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying I want my kids to come back here if it's unsafe, but why can 
they so quickly decide to rebuild Northridge mall and Cal State Northridge with 
that devastation and we're sitting here in limbo?" asked Mara Cohen, a mother 
of a second-grade student. "Why are mall shoppers more important than 
students?" 
</P>
<P>
 Brown told parents that after an independent geologic and seismic evaluation 
last week indicated that the school may not be safe in future quakes or 
aftershocks, district officials would rather err on the side of caution. He 
gave the school a 50-50 chance of reopening. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ground is so unstable and we know so little about it that for your safety 
and for your children's safety, we need to make a temporary relocation," Brown 
said. "I would not put my own children or grandchildren in this school at this 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, City Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents the area around Van 
Gogh, said he questioned whether the school district was using the soil survey 
as an excuse to shut down the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he did not speak at the meeting, he said afterward that he questioned 
whether the move to Frost was hasty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see them determine if it's safe, and I think it is if it 
withstood this tremendous earthquake," Bernson said. "I think their real agenda 
is to close this site." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Schools Supt. Sid Thompson said Wednesday that he would not 
speculate on whether the site will be closed until the reviews are complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm responsible for these kids -- not the city of Los Angeles," Thompson 
said. "Our latest reports show us it's not safe at this point." Principal 
Maureen Diekmann said the Frost site was chosen because the younger children 
could be segregated from the older students. Thompson said that district 
officials are also examining the possibility of using other sites -- including 
Rinaldi Adult Education Center -- on a more permanent basis if Van Gogh is 
determined to be unsafe.

BACK IN BUSINESS BUT SADLY; AFTERMATH: PIZZERIA UNO STAFF MOURNS COLLEAGUE AND 
QUAKE VICTIM ADAM SLOTNICK.

 The employees at Pizzeria Uno in Northridge came to work Wednesday and opened 
the place for business, but it wasn't for the paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 They did it for Adam Slotnick. In memory of their boss, who died in the quake 
-- and as an unspoken way of getting on with their lives -- the employees 
rallied to become the first shop in the badly damaged Northridge Fashion Center 
to open since the Jan. 17 temblor. On that wretched morning, part of their mall 
collapsed for all the world to see, becoming a symbol of the havoc wreaked on 
the shopper-friendly San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the restaurant's employees are refugees of the Northridge earthquake 
themselves, with doomed apartments and lost possessions. But they started 
showing up for cleanup duty the first day, without really saying why. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of everyone being down, they all came in and volunteered to help," 
said general manager Keith Ishibashi. "It's been a healing process." 
</P>
<P>
 As they work, talk always seems to turn to Slotnick. At 27, he wasn't the 
oldest victim of the quake nor the youngest, noteworthy neither for his heroism 
nor his folly. He was just a nice guy, they say, a recent East Coast transplant 
trying to make friends and make it up the career ladder at the close-knit 
restaurant chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "For myself, if I dwelled on the loss of a good friend without replacing it 
with fond memories, it leaves an empty spot and an empty feeling," Ishibashi 
said while overseeing the final cleaning and polishing. "When you stay busy at 
a restaurant where he worked hard, it brings back fond memories." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the money," he said. "It's what Adam would want." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if the mall was a focal point of the disaster, Ishibashi and others 
said, they wanted it to also be a visible sign of the recovery, proving that 
Angelenos can dust themselves off and get on with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrapped in their work once again Wednesday, some said they could almost forget 
the quake and kept expecting to hear Slotnick's familiar voice. "I'm still 
feeling that today, waiting for him to come around the corner," said Lori 
Rudolph, 27, as she worked the bar. "And it's just not going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 After snooping around for an hour Wednesday afternoon, a Fire Department 
inspector gave the restaurant permission to open, even though a yellow tag 
remained to tell customers that the mall itself is closed. The inspector warned 
Ishibashi to keep the looky-loos away from the construction next door, where 
workers were trying to shore up the damaged Broadway department store. On the 
other side of Pizzeria Uno is the Bullock's that all but imploded. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the doors opened, several customers already were munching on 
deep-dish pizza or having a midday cocktail. Some were construction workers 
fixing up the mall, which is expected to reopen in July. For others returning 
to their favorite lunch haunt, just being able to sit in a familiar Naugahyde 
booth was a small but welcome consolation in a world of disconsolate changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost so much. It's really comforting that the restaurant is still 
here," said Judy Palmer, who works security at the Broadway. "It's like family. 
We're friends with everyone here." 
</P>
<P>
 That closeness, that camaraderie, is the reason the folks at Uno's have taken 
Slotnick's death so hard. He wasn't just the boss. He was a friend, someone 
whom Amy Barcellos, 21, and other employees could go to for advice. After work, 
they often would pal around together. 
</P>
<P>
 When Slotnick failed to show up the morning of the quake, some employees 
rushed to the ill-fated Northridge Meadows complex where he lived in a 
ground-floor apartment. Barcellos was still there at midnight when firefighters 
pulled him out of the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire chief said he died instantly," Barcellos said, "that he didn't 
suffer any pain." 
</P>
<P>
 That pain, Barcellos and others said, was saved for those who worked with 
Slotnick. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, they say, they are overcome by sadness -- for themselves, their 
beleaguered city and their shy friend who worked so hard and worked even harder 
at making everyone like him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all discussed it. Some days we're better at it than others," said 
hostess Mary LaRouche, 60, who describes herself as the "grandmother" of Uno's 
cadre of students and other young people. "Some days, we just hug each other." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an unspoken feeling," said LaRouche, "that even though we're stronger 
for going through this together, that Adam isn't with us anymore. But you have 
to get back doing something, or you're scared."

PICK OF THE LITTER; ANIMALS: HUNDREDS OF DOGS AND CATS FOUND WANDERING AFTER 
THE QUAKE ARE AT RISK. BUT PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING TO THE WEST VALLEY SHELTER'S 
CALL FOR ADOPTION.

 At the West Valley Animal Shelter Wednesday, Spot, Rover and Lucky were facing 
what was certainly the most important day of their dog and cat lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone were the carefree days of fetching sticks, afternoon naps on sunny window 
sills and monthly baths in the kitchen sink. Instead, about 300 animals found 
wandering in the days after the Jan. 17 earthquake faced the prospect of being 
killed by the shelter if they were not reunited with their owners or picked up 
by surrogate masters. 
</P>
<P>
 The lives of the earthquake animals already have been extended longer than the 
shelter's customary eight-to-10-day holding period because the city's 
Department of Animal Regulation wants to give shaken quake victims time to put 
their lives in order before they worry about lost pets. Wednesday was the 
second day that animals found after the quake were available for public 
adoption. Previously, they could only be picked up by their owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Though officials said they had not decided when unclaimed animals would be 
destroyed, one shelter employee, who requested anonymity, said many of the dogs 
and cats had been locked in cages for almost three weeks and something had to 
happen soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are getting a lot of sick dogs and a lot of dogfights because they've 
been here so long," the employee said. "People . . . just don't understand that 
you can't keep them here forever." 
</P>
<P>
 At the West Valley shelter Wednesday morning, emotions ranged from giddy 
celebration to deep despair as about 70 people braved the cold to line up 
before the 8 a.m. opening. Some were missing school. Others had skipped work. 
All came for a new pet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was bumper-to-bumper on the Ventura Freeway, but it was worth it," said 
Kimi Peck of Toluca Lake, who showed up for the second consecutive day and 
adopted her second dog -- a Chihuahua this time. She had taken home another 
smallish dog, whose breed she wasn't sure of, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Park drove in from Mid-Wilshire to find a pet for his children, ages 8 
and 5, whose two cats ran away during the quake. After slowly scanning the 
caged animals, Park settled on a cocker spaniel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's for the family," he explained. "I have to be careful so I pick something 
everyone will like." 
</P>
<P>
 But 8-year-old Krista Dunlop fell hard and she fell fast. "I want that one!" 
she said, pointing to a frisky black Labrador puppy that was trying to stick 
its face through a small hole in the cage. 
</P>
<P>
 And why? 
</P>
<P>
 "She started biting on my finger," she gushed happily. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Krista's glee turned to tears when she learned that at least 
one other person wanted the pup, and she and her mother would be forced to bid 
on it in an auction set up by the shelter.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 
RIORDAN REJECTS PROPOSAL TO TEMPORARILY REOPEN DUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Los Angeles sanitation officials study the possibility of hauling trash to 
Utah, Mayor Richard Riordan has rejected a proposal to temporarily reopen a 
controversial landfill north of Granada Hills to accept earthquake rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's office notified operators of the closed Sunshine Canyon Landfill 
Tuesday that there is no immediate need to reopen the dump because adequate 
landfill space exists for the debris created by the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the landfill's operator, Browning Ferris Industries, called 
the decision "preposterous," saying that BFI is willing to take rubble for free 
from public agencies for 30 days; the Utah landfill will charge $45 per ton. 
"If they say they can take it to Utah for $45 per ton, then we can do it for 
$45 cheaper," said BFI spokesman Arnie Berghoff. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials said the Utah trash-hauling idea is only being considered 
as a long-term landfill alternative and that landfills serving Los Angeles have 
enough capacity to meet the immediate needs following the quake. However, if 
the city decides to implement the Utah dumping proposal to accept earthquake 
rubble, federal emergency funding may be available to subsidize the cost, said 
Lillian Kawasaki, general manager of the city's Environmental Affairs 
Department, which regulates landfills.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; BAIL 
REFUSED FOR SUSPECT IN 1980 MAIL-BOMB MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge refused Wednesday to set bail for William Ross, a former 
Hawthorne real estate agent accused of complicity in the 1980 mail-bomb murder 
of a Manhattan Beach secretary.  
</P>
<P>
 Ross, 57, fled to Canada in July, 1992, a month before he was indicted a 
second time in connection with the bombing.He was arrested there Nov. 23. 
Jurors deadlocked in an earlier trial of Ross and co-defendant Rochelle 
Manning, 53. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning's husband, Robert, was convicted Oct. 14 of federal charges stemming 
from the attack and faces a likely life prison term when he is sentenced later 
this month. Rochelle Manning is still fighting extradition from Israel.  
</P>
<P>
 Ross was denied bail after his return to Los Angeles, but Wednesday sought a 
new hearing on the issue from U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian. Attorney 
Mitchell Egers said Ross fled to escape the "pain and humiliation" of another 
arrest.  
</P>
<P>
 Egers said the agents who originally arrested Ross did so in front of his 
family and friends, purposely tightened handcuffs until they hurt and refused 
to let him use the bathroom. The attorney added that Ross was willing to put up 
"everything he owns" as bail, assets worth $2 million.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 
YAROSLAVSKY RAISES $70,000 IN BID FOR SUPERVISOR'S POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, an outspoken advocate of campaign 
finance reform, has amassed more than $700,000 in his bid for county 
supervisor, much of it in donations of more than $1,000 from special interests. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Telephoning prominent lobbyists, developers and other potential contributors 
to support his candidacy, Yaroslavsky raised more than half the money -- about 
$400,000 -- during the last three weeks of 1993.The rest was left over from his 
previous council campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky, who kicked off his campaign last month with a pledge to push for 
limits on political contributions, acknowledged Wednesday that his fund-raising 
task was made easier by the absence of restrictions on county elections. 
Candidates for City Council cannot accept more than $500 from a single donor, a 
law that does not apply to county elections. Thus, Yaroslavsky was able to 
raise the $400,000 in three weeks from 189 contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Yaroslavsky's only opponent so far, retired city firefighter Don 
Wallace, has raised about $10,000 in his bid for the 3rd District seat.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: UNUSUALLY DRY WINTER 
LINKED TO RETURN OF EL NINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It isn't a drought yet, but if you think it's been a lot drier than usual this 
winter, you're right. 
</P>
<P>
 During December and January, normally two of the wettest months, only 1.11 
inches of rain fell on Los Angeles, compared to a normal total of 4.95 inches. 
The total so far for the season, which began July 1, is only 1.93 inches, 
compared to an average total through Feb. 1 of 7.93 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters say it all probably has something to do with El Nino , the 
little-understood weather phenomenon that usually means more rain than usual, 
but this year apparently means a lot less. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very unpredictable thing," Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with 
WeatherData Inc., admitted during a telephone interview. "I'm not sure what to 
say." 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, one of Brack's associates, fellow WeatherData meteorologist James 
McCutcheon, noted that photographs from National Oceanographic and Atmospheric 
Administration satellites had confirmed a return of El Nino -- a reversal of 
the normal trade-wind patterns that cause the pooling of warm water off Peru. 
</P>
<P>
 McCutcheon said that for reasons not fully understood, El Nino usually leads 
to a strengthening of the subtropical jet steam north of the Equator. When that 
happens, masses of warm, moist air off the east coast of Hawaii start drifting 
toward Southern California, bringing with them increasing chances of 
substantial rain. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what happened last winter, when Southern California and Baja California 
were hammered by storms that caused disastrous flooding. When McCutcheon saw 
three months ago that El Nino was back, he saw a good chance of more of the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had to make your wager right now, I'd bet on another wet winter in 
Southern California," he said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for McCutcheon, he's not a gambler. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, high-pressure ridge after high-pressure ridge has been developing 
along the West Coast, blocking the storm systems from reaching Southern 
California," Brack said. " El Nino supposedly is still there, but it's not 
doing what it usually does. This year it seems to be causing dry weather." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Thoren, another WeatherData meteorologist, said Wednesday there could be 
a few light showers here tonight and early Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Brack is still optimistic about the prospects of rain in coming 
months. But even if this springs's rains don't amount to much -- and despite 
relatively little snow in the eastern High Sierra, source of much of the city's 
drinking water -- continuing conservation and a surplus from last year's heavy 
rains mean Los Angeles will have plenty of water this summer, city officials 
say. ERIC MALNIC

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; YMCA EXTENDS CHILD CARE FOR QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a single mother raising three children, Teresa Olea struggled to find day 
care for her three children so she could return to work after the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so worried," said Olea, 37, who missed a week of work because she could 
not find day care. "For two days, I brought them with me to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Olea, who works for Electro Adapter in Chatsworth, said because she feared 
that something might happen to the children, she could barely concentrate on 
her work. 
</P>
<P>
 That was until the Mid-Valley YMCA opened its doors the week after the quake 
to provide extended day care for children unable to attend school. Although the 
building that houses the YMCA had suffered minor damage, staff members worked 
vigorously in the days following the quake to clean up and prepare for 
providing child care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without them, I don't know what I would do with my kids," Olea said. "They 
saved my life." 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross reported that 365 people are staying in four Red Cross shelters 
in Van Nuys and 96 are living in the community's parks. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 of those families took advantage of the extended day care, officials 
said. The center did not charge for the extended care and lengthened its hours 
to accommodate parents in the disaster, opening at 6:30 a.m. and closing at 
6:30 p.m. Normal hours are 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members coaxed the children to express their feelings about the 
earthquake, giving them paper and crayons to draw the effects of the quake on 
their homes, and talking about each child's experience, said Dave Newman, 
senior program director at the YMCA. Although many of the older children were 
able to express themselves, the smaller children, Newman said, still clung to 
their fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been sleeping next to this little girl here until she falls asleep 
everyday since the earthquake," said Adelyn Thimote, director of the preschool 
there. "All the children are feeling very insecure." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything fell down," said 6-year-old Jonpatrick Edjedawe. "It made me feel 
very bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the YMCA staff members were dealing with their own disasters. 
Newman said he was worried about his wife, who gave birth to their fourth child 
days after the temblor. He said his Simi Valley house was in shambles, forcing 
him to move his family to a nearby hotel while he worked at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had our own problems, but we were there for the community," Newman said. 
About 10 out of the center's 60 staff members lost their homes or were 
displaced by the quake, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center also expanded their "shower hours" from a half-hour to 10 hours so 
people in the parks could utilize them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although important, day care wasn't the only thing on Olea's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 After her Van Nuys apartment was damaged in the quake, her family moved to the 
Van Nuys Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to stay in the park for four days with my kids," Olea said. "They were 
coughing a lot and I was feeling so terrible," she said. "Besides the 
earthquake, we were on the street with no place to go. I was very frustrated 
and anxious." 
</P>
<P>
 Olea said her two youngest children, Lydia, 6, and Eric, 4, caught colds, 
forcing her to move back into her apartment building in a less damaged unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Since separating from her husband two years ago, Olea has depended on the YMCA 
for child care. JEANNETTE REGALADO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; AREA SPARED FROM MOST OF QUAKE'S WRATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It may be the question that puzzles Encino residents for years to come: Why 
not us? 
</P>
<P>
 When the Northridge quake struck on Jan. 17, houses shook, windows broke and 
nerves rattled. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the dust settled, Encino residents and business owners found that 
most of the quake damage to their community was cosmetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very, very fortunate," said Jan Sobel, executive director of the 
Encino Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fared very well." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sobel, none of the chamber's 625 members suffered damage severe 
enough to shut their doors for more than a few days.  
</P>
<P>
 Some businesses along Ventura Boulevard lost plate glass windows and 
merchandise in the temblor, Sobel said, but no buildings were condemned. 
</P>
<P>
 While the entire 11th District -- including Woodland Hills, Encino, Tarzana, 
and parts of Van Nuys and Sherman Oaks -- suffered an estimated $98 million in 
damage, fewer than half a dozen buildings in Encino were red-tagged by the 
Department of Building and Safety, according to Glenn Barr, a spokesman for 
Councilman Marvin Braude. 
</P>
<P>
 Impact totals for Encino alone are not available, but Barr said the estimated 
damage for the Encino buildings deemed unsafe in initial surveys was about $3 
million.  
</P>
<P>
 Four of those were 70-unit apartment buildings on the 5300 and 5400 blocks of 
Newcastle Avenue near the northwestern corner of Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a conclave of apartment buildings north of Ventura Boulevard where 
there was a lot of damage," Barr said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But by and large, there's not that much damage on other streets in Encino," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 509-unit condominium complex on White Oak Avenue, also north of Ventura 
Boulevard, sustained more than a $1 million in damage, but very little of it 
was structural. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Arthur Rosenberg, president of the Encino Oaks Homeowners Assn., 
which represents the complex's 1,200 residents, most of the damage to the 38 
units, now closed for repairs, was to the stucco and plaster walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first floor looks like a bad ride at Disneyland," Rosenberg said.  
</P>
<P>
 "In my place, the walls were split wide open." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rosenberg said the damage looks worse than it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're the lucky ones," Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake was less forgiving to two Encino schools -- Lanai Road Elementary 
and Encino Elementary -- which remained closed several days longer than most 
schools in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Encino Elementary suffered structural damage to a two-story building that 
houses nine classrooms, but the extended closure at Lanai was due to a gas 
leak.  
</P>
<P>
 Both schools have reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Encino residents wonder why their community fared so much better than 
the surrounding communities of Reseda, Van Nuys and Sherman Oaks -- all 
pummeled severely by the quake.  
</P>
<P>
 It's a question seismologists are asking too. 
</P>
<P>
 James Mori, the scientist in charge of the U.S. Geological Survey in Pasadena, 
said there are a number of factors that contribute to the destruction an 
earthquake causes -- from the force of the quake, to the direction the waves 
travel, to the density of the soil and, finally, to the construction of the 
buildings.  
</P>
<P>
 He said it will take months to understand why some communities fared better 
than their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, some questions may never be answered. 
</P>
<P>
 "The damage in earthquakes is never wholesale destruction," Mori said. "You 
don't get a consistent damage pattern. It's always very irregular." SUSAN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE IS SETBACK FOR ADOBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The public opening of the oldest structure in Agoura Hills, the historic Reyes 
Adobe, suffered a $50,000 setback from earthquake damage, but the city 
otherwise fared well compared to its neighbors to the east. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reyes Adobe, completed in 1820, was the only building in Agoura Hills to 
be deemed temporarily uninhabitable after the Jan. 17 quake, said City Manager 
Terry Matz. 
</P>
<P>
 The adobe was declared structurally sound this week, said Director of 
Community Services Audrey Brown, although the temblor did about $50,000 worth 
of damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has applied for repair funds from the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a major setback," Brown said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Even more than before, I don't know when we are going to be able to open it 
up to the public." 
</P>
<P>
 The Reyes Adobe received a $158,000 face lift in 1988, but about $250,000 in 
needed landscaping and other repairs went unfunded and no opening date had been 
set. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, city officials inspected about 200 homes, noting cracked chimneys 
and patios.  
</P>
<P>
 The Chesebro Road bridge over the Ventura Freeway sustained $5,000 in damages, 
but no lanes were closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The pre-dawn quake also provided the most dramatic test to date for the Agoura 
Hills Disaster Response Team, a group of about 60 volunteers formed in 1988 to 
provide assistance if the town is ever cut off from professional emergency 
crews during a calamity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within minutes of the earthquake," said team Director Scott Brewer, "the 
emergency operations center in City Hall was activated by volunteers, some of 
whom were worried about family members who live closer to the epicenter.  
</P>
<P>
 "But they responded like professionals." 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen volunteers made a street-by-street check of Agoura Hills for severe 
damage, fires or other emergencies, Brewer said.  
</P>
<P>
 By 8:15 a.m., they were satisfied that there were none. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, Brewer said, several drove to Northridge and other sites in the 
Valley to join relief efforts of the Red Cross and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get that initial rush of adrenaline," said Brewer, a trained emergency 
medical technician who went to Northridge Hospital Medical Center.  
</P>
<P>
 "But when you realize that you and your family are all right, and your home 
and your town are OK, those of us with emergency training usually want to help 
out where we're needed." KURT PITZER

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: INGLEWOOD; 16-YEAR-OLD 
BOY ARRESTED IN MURDER OF GIRL, 14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acting on a citizen's tip, Inglewood police have arrested a 16-year-old Los 
Angeles youth in connection with the murder of a 14-year-old Inglewood girl 
last week, one of a series of shooting attacks that left five people dead and 
six wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, whose name was withheld because of his age, was taken into 
custody Monday but the arrest was not revealed until Wednesday because police 
are still looking for at least two other suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Tila Lashay French, 14, a freshman at Hawthorne High School, was killed Jan. 
26 when three men believed to be gang members opened fire on a group of youths 
in front of an apartment building on North Eucalyptus Avenue. Two other 
teen-agers were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the same men may have fired shots that killed a 2-year-old girl 
and wounded her mother in front of their home on West 78th Street in Inglewood 
less than an hour earlier. The next night three 21-year-old men were shot to 
death while sitting in a car on North Market Street; the same suspects may have 
been involved, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Inglewood City Council on Tuesday offered a $25,000 reward for information 
leading to arrests of the suspects in the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Police refused to say where in Los Angeles the 16-year-old suspect was 
arrested, but law enforcement authorities believe the killings in Inglewood 
were part of an ongoing war between Inglewood gangs and gangs centered in the 
Crenshaw District of Los Angeles. Police stressed, however, that almost all of 
the Inglewood victims were not affiliated with gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (gang members) seem to be satisfied if they shoot anybody in the enemy's 
territory," Inglewood Police Sgt. Alex Perez said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SUNLAND; BOY ON BICYCLE 
KILLED BY METROLINK TRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ignoring an engineer's warning signals, a boy rode his bicycle around a 
railroad crossing barrier in Sunland and was killed Wednesday by a Metrolink 
train traveling about 50 m.p.h, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told authorities that the unidentified youth ignored warning signs 
not to cross the tracks at Sunland Boulevard and San Fernando Road.The victim's 
body was thrown about 200 feet by the impact of the Los Angels-bound train, 
Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The train was slowing as it approached the new Burbank station about 6 p.m., 
Hidalgo said. The posted speed limit in the area for Metrolink trains is 59 
m.p.h., he added. None of the 30 passengers or crew members aboard the train, 
carrying passengers from Santa Clarita, were injured, Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been 14 fatal accidents since Metrolink began operations in 
October, 1992, half of them declared suicides by the county coroner's office.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: DOWNTOWN L.A.; 
TELECOMMUTING PLAN OKD FOR 15,000 CITY WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles City Council committee approved a plan Tuesday that would cut 
Downtown traffic by allowing a third of the city work force to participate in a 
new telecommuting plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 15,000 workers would be able to work out of their homes or from 
satellite offices under the plan approved by the council's Administrative 
Services Committee. It will be considered by the full council later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, which has been in the works for almost two years, would reduce 
traffic and air pollution and help the city meet a mandate by the Southern 
California Air Quality Management District to reduce the number of workers 
commuting at peak hours, officials said.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUNLAND-TUJUNGA; LANDMARK RESTAURANT STILL AWAITS REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since Jan. 17, Ben Caputo has been playing the waiting game. 
</P>
<P>
 The co-owner of the landmark Sterling's Restaurant in Sunland gets asked 
almost every day whether he will reopen the business that has hosted hundreds 
of wedding receptions, civic club meetings and community events. 
</P>
<P>
 Each time the question is answered the same: He doesn't know. He's waiting -- 
waiting for inspectors; waiting for insurance agents; waiting, waiting, 
waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Down the line, everybody suffers, everybody hurts," Caputo said. "My main 
concern is with my employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of his 21 employees, who now have to seek disaster assistance, have been 
with the restaurant longer than he has. Some have been there since 1965, when 
the restaurant, in Sunland since 1938, opened at its current location on 
Fenwick Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake that struck in the early morning of Jan. 17 spared much of 
Sunland-Tujunga, a hillside area above the San Fernando Valley in northeast Los 
Angeles. But the damage to Sterling's -- cracked ceilings and walls, kitchen 
equipment pulled out of the walls, damage to the floors -- has already had a 
major ripple effect in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really going to be hard for the community if they don't reopen," said 
Joan Slater, president of the Sunland-Tujunga Chamber of Commerce. Sterling's 
Restaurant has been the major meeting place for many of the local community 
groups and functions for the area. Caputo said the restaurant also draws groups 
from Lake View Terrace, Sylmar, Burbank and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 By one estimate, Caputo said it could cost as much as $350,000 to fix the 
building, but how to get it repaired is the problem. He has been forced to play 
a waiting game with contractors, insurance companies and government assistance 
agencies. He is often asked when he will reopen, and he has no answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very frustrating, really," said Caputo, who co-owns the restaurant 
with his partner, Al Jesenski. "My usual routine is getting down there at 7 or 
7:30 in the morning and after a while say 'Hell, I can't do anything. I might 
as well leave.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Another damaged building important to the community is the gym at the Sunland 
Recreation Center, across the street from Sterling's. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've either canceled some of our classes or transferred them to somewhere 
else," said Greg Perkins, senior recreation director for the center. About 20 
bricks were lost from the center's gym wall, forcing the building to close the 
day after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball, square dancing and country-Western programs have been relocated. 
The archery program is looking for a new site. The women's volleyball program 
is hoping to relocate to the Stonehurst Recreation Center in Sun Valley after 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency moves out. But a free-play volleyball 
program and the archery program needs to find a new site. 
</P>
<P>
 The only program that has given refunds is ice skating, which uses a rink in 
North Hollywood damaged by the earthquake, Perkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Slater said, "it looks like we were pretty fortunate up here. We didn't 
have nearly the damage we had in the 1971 quake." ED BOND

DAMAGE MIGHT SPEED COUNTY HOSPITAL PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS P. SHUIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Extensive earthquake damage to the pediatric and psychiatric hospitals within 
the County-USC Medical Center complex could bring in money to help speed up a 
$1-billion replacement project for the center scheduled for completion in 2002, 
Los Angeles County health officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pediatric Pavilion, a children's hospital within the complex, was the 
latest victim of the earthquake and its aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershocks, particularly the 5.0 jolt on Saturday, left the structure so 
badly weakened that the hospital was evacuated Tuesday night, county officials 
said. The 37 children and 16 adults in the hospital were moved to other 
facilities within the Medical Center complex. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, eight buildings at the Medical Center were damaged, the worst 
destruction absorbed by the pediatric and psychiatric hospitals, both of which 
are now empty. The preliminary estimate of damage to the Medical Center 
buildings is $389 million. 
</P>
<P>
 County administrators, as well as state and federal health officials, must 
decide whether to pump millions of dollars into the hospitals to repair quake 
damage and bring them up to current safety codes, or perform temporary repairs 
and use the money for a major new replacement hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said they were encouraged by comments over the weekend by 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, who 
toured the medical center Saturday. Shalala told Federal Emergency Management 
Agency Director James Lee Witt outside the Pediatric Pavilion, "We ought to see 
this as an opportunity to plan for health care in the 21st Century, not rebuild 
what we had." 
</P>
<P>
 One state official, Neal Hardman, principal architect for the Office of 
Statewide Health Planning and Assistance, cautioned against expecting too much 
of a windfall. He said state disaster relief could provide some help, but it 
would be on the order of an insurance agency weighing the claim for an older 
car totaled in an accident. "If you have a Chevrolet, we won't buy you a 
Cadillac," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Groundbreaking for the replacement hospital is scheduled to begin in 1995, but 
the county is still in the process of completing its environmental impact 
report. It still must submit its architectural plans to the state for approval. 
Financing for the $1-billion project also remains murky, with county officials 
hopeful of getting state bond money to pay for it. Another obstacle is the need 
to reach agreements with local property owners to buy homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Health planners envision a new hospital with a 15-story tower, plus a 
five-story diagnostic and treatment facility. The new Medical Center would 
house services now performed in two outpatient facilities and four separate 
hospitals in the County-USC Medical Center complex -- the historic General 
Hospital, Women's Hospital, Psychiatric Hospital and Pediatric Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the buildings are at least 30 years old and do not meet codes for 
fire, evacuation and earthquake safety. Because some of the facilities do not 
have modern fire alarm systems, fire patrols routinely walk hospital corridors 
looking for smoke. General Hospital, the backdrop for numerous movies and 
television shows, was completed in 1932; the Pediatric Pavilion went up in the 
mid-1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Holland, the administrator for plant management at the medical center 
complex, said at a news conference Wednesday that he thinks the earthquake 
damage will hasten approval of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see it much sooner," Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Bagley, a regional administrative chief for the county Department of 
Health Services who is in charge of the County-USC Medical Center, was more 
cautious but still optimistic based on discussions with Shalala and Witt. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made what we thought were general policy statements that we interpreted 
as very positive," he said, cautioning that firm commitments are a long way 
off.

KING'S REQUEST TO BAR JUDGE FROM TRIAL IS DENIED; COURTS: AN APPELLATE COURT 
JUSTICE SUGGESTS, HOWEVER, THAT JOHN G. DAVIES REMOVE HIMSELF FROM HEARING THE 
CIVIL SUIT AGAINST THE CITY AND POLICE OFFICERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal appeals court in San Francisco on Wednesday denied Rodney G. King's 
request that U.S. District Judge John G. Davies be prevented from presiding 
over King's civil case against the city of Los Angeles and the police officers 
who beat him. 
</P>
<P>
 However, one of the three appellate judges, Stephen Reinhardt, suggested that 
Davies voluntarily bow out. 
</P>
<P>
 Davies' statements and rulings strongly suggest that he has "expressed firm 
conclusions regarding the factual issues that are critical to the outcome of 
King's civil trial, and that, as a result, his impartiality might reasonably be 
questioned," Reinhardt wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinhardt stressed that he considered Davies "a fair-minded individual." 
</P>
<P>
 However, "the important point is that there is an appearance that he is 
possessed of firm opinions regarding the merits of virtually every important 
factual issue underlying King's civil claim," Reinhardt wrote. "Under these 
circumstances the public might well have cause seriously to question the 
fairness of the civil proceedings." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By coincidence, Davies was assigned to hear both King's multimillion-dollar 
lawsuit and the criminal civil rights case against Sgt. Stacey C. Koon and 
officers Laurence M. Powell, Timothy E. Wind and Theodore J. Briseno. Koon and 
Powell were convicted in that case last year. Davies' comments during 
sentencing and rulings he made in the criminal and civil cases served as the 
basis for the removal motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinhardt and his U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeal colleagues ruled that 
King's attorneys had not met the burden of proof to disqualify Davies. They 
upheld an earlier ruling by U.S. District Judge W. Matthew Byrne Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges usually are disqualified only for exhibiting bias or prejudice outside 
the courtroom. However, King's attorneys contended that Davies should be 
removed because his courtroom remarks demonstrated "pervasive bias." 
</P>
<P>
 King's attorney, Victoria E. King, cited several of Davies' actions, which 
also were noted by Reinhardt in his opinion. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Davies made sympathetic statements about the defendants in the criminal 
case, including describing them as having "distinguished records of public 
service," even though he knew that each had been involved in at least one prior 
incident involving excessive force and falsification of reports to supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Davies excluded evidence of the officers' racist comments from the criminal 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * Davies found that "the incident . . . would not have occurred at all, but 
for Mr. King's initial misconduct," a reference to the fact that King was 
speeding on the highway and led officers on a chase after they tried to pull 
him over. 
</P>
<P>
 * Davies said that King had "no serious injuries" and that there was only one 
blow to his head or face (possibly "inadvertent"). 
</P>
<P>
 "It is hard to conceive of a factual issue more critical to the damages 
question" in King's civil trial "than the severity of King's injuries," 
Reinhardt wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 King was struck 56 times during the videotaped March, 1991, beating.

FAULT FOUND UNDERNEATH WILSHIRE BOULEVARD; GEOLOGY: RIFT EXTENDS UNDER 
HOLLYWOOD AND BEVERLY HILLS. EXPERTS SAY IT COULD PRODUCE A QUAKE OF 5.7 
MAGNITUDE OR GREATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Geologists have discovered a buried thrust fault, like the one that triggered 
the Northridge earthquake, running for several miles beneath Wilshire Boulevard 
and extending under Hollywood and Beverly Hills in one of the most densely 
populated sections of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientists cautioned that there is no evidence that the fault has produced 
a major quake since the city was settled, and there is no way to know if it 
ever will.  
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the team of six geologists from Oregon State University and 
Caltech said the newly identified Wilshire Fault "poses a seismic hazard to 
some of the most expensive real estate in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The fault could trigger a quake of magnitude 5.7 or more, they said, and cause 
severe property damage in an area with many older buildings that have not been 
structurally reinforced to meet newer, more stringent building codes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilshire Fault, they said, represents a hazard common throughout the Los 
Angeles basin. They believe it poses no greater hazard than any of dozens of 
other so-called blind thrust faults believed to run under the metropolitan 
area.  
</P>
<P>
 Other major faults have been found nearby, one under MacArthur Park, another 
directly under Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, and one under Santa Monica 
Boulevard running west to the coastline along the Pacific Palisades.  
</P>
<P>
 Buried thrust faults are difficult to detect even under the best of 
circumstances because they do not break the surface. The Wilshire fault is more 
than two miles deep.  
</P>
<P>
 When buried thrust faults do rupture, as happened on Jan. 17 in the Northridge 
quake, the energy is directed almost straight up in a violent vertical heave. 
Only recently have scientists begun to appreciate the danger such faults pose 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one of a couple of dozen faults we have identified under Los Angeles 
that are capable of producing damaging earthquakes," said Caltech earthquake 
expert James F. Dolan, who helped prepare the research. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Geological Society of America plans to publish the research in the April 
issue of Geology.  
</P>
<P>
 The new fault is believed to run from east to west, uplifting the terrain from 
the Elysian Hills on the east to Beverly Hills on the northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of variables and a lot of assumptions we had to make," said 
Cheryl Hummon, one of two OSU graduate students who prepared the study. "This 
is our best guess about where the fault is located. We just don't have enough 
data to pinpoint it. 
</P>
<P>
 The geologists located the fault by analyzing core samples from oil wells and 
test drilling conducted as part of subway construction. They also studied a 
pattern of six very small earthquakes in the immediate area of the fault 
between 1970 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as we can tell, this fold started growing a million years ago," Hummon 
said. "Where there is a fold, there is a thrust fault or a reverse fault 
underneath it uplifting it. Folds grow during an earthquake on the fault 
underlying the fold," she said. "That was true in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 The fault has pushed up the sediments above it by about 1,300 feet over the 
millennia. Normally, the two sides of the fault move by each other at a speed 
barely exceeding one-tenth of an inch a year. But preliminary evidence suggests 
that the fault may have been responsible for about 2,000 serious "oblique slip" 
earthquakes since it started to lift the sediments above it about 800,000 years 
ago.  
</P>
<P>
 "Until 1987, we did not even realize that blind thrust faults could cause 
quakes," Dolan said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Forewarned is forearmed. If people understand what they are up against, they 
will do a much better job of preparing for an earthquake," he said. New Fault 
Geologists at Oregon State University and Caltech have discovered a potentially 
dangerous buried thrust fault running along Wilshire Boulevard in Hollywood and 
Beverly Hills. There has not been a major earthquake on the fault in recorded 
history but if it did rupture, it could cause an earthquake of magnitude 5.7 or 
greater, geologists said.

FOOD STAMPS DENIED IN FRAUD CRACKDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As part of an effort to crack down on fraudulent claims, federal officials 
said Wednesday they have denied 4,334 applications for emergency food stamps by 
residents in the Los Angeles area during the last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowds of more than 1,000 earthquake victims continued this week to line up at 
Dodger Stadium and three other large processing centers to obtain coupons that 
can be redeemed for food at grocery stores, Department of Agriculture officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, authorities arrested five people on charges of buying and 
reselling food stamps outside a South-Central Los Angeles check-cashing store. 
More arrests are expected as a task force of 29 undercover investigators fans 
out across Southern California streets in search of fraudulent transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when you have so many hundreds of thousands of people who have stood 
on lines and are so desperate, we are going to have many of those desperate 
people acting out street crimes the same way they would in any instance," said 
Ellen Haas, assistant secretary for food and consumer services. 
</P>
<P>
 Haas testified Wednesday, at a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing on fraud 
and abuse in nutrition assistance programs, that illegal food stamp trafficking 
exceeded $1 billion last year. In some cases, she said, coupons were exchanged 
for guns and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government began distributing emergency food stamps Jan. 24. So 
far, 117,419 earthquake victims have received $35.7 million in vouchers, in 
addition to the more than $60 million in food stamps issued each month in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The daily number of rejected applications has increased from 30 on Jan. 24 to 
1,212 Tuesday as federal officials employed various tactics to crack down on 
fraud in Los Angeles. These include warning applicants through flyers and 
loudspeaker announcements that food stamp fraud is punishable by fines up to 
$250,000, reducing the number of application sites from 29 to 16 and 
instituting a three-day waiting period before providing benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are doing so much aggressively to prevent (fraud)," Haas said. "A lot of 
fraud isn't just street trafficking; a lot of people are double-dipping." 
</P>
<P>
 Once applications are received, inspectors use a state computer system to 
check for repeat applications and use information from various sources to 
verify statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, food stamp fraud often takes place at some of the 207,000 retail 
stores authorized to accept the vouchers. Last year, Department of Agriculture 
officials reported finding violations in 2,147 stores. In Illinois, authorities 
indicted 19 individuals and 12 corporations on fraud and money laundering 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "The integrity of the food stamp program is at stake," Sen. Richard G. Lugar 
(R-Ind.) told Agriculture Department officials at Wednesday's hearing. "The 
amount of press attention emphasizing fraud is devastating."

AROUND THE VALLEY: EARTHQUAKE CAN'T CRACK THE FOUNDATION OF THIS NEW MARRIAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forgive the pun, but our marriage is off to a shaky start. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks to the day after we set up our first household as husband and wife, 
we were jolted awake by the bed shaking, not in the throes of marital bliss, 
but in the violence of a magnitude 6.6 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 What a way to wake up. 
</P>
<P>
 And what a way to start a marriage -- especially since my wife is a Colorado 
native whose disdain for Los Angeles is second only to her contempt for skiing 
Texans. Even before the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, she was convinced that 
Southern California was little more than a haven for crackheads and crackpots. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the cracks in our walls have her scared that the whole place -- freeways 
and Disneyland and all -- is sliding straight into the Pacific Ocean, a notion 
native Californians like me tend to laugh off as quaint. We might ultimately 
end up around San Francisco, but, hey, that's still millions of years away. 
</P>
<P>
 If I sound glib, forgive me. But I am a California boy and earthquakes -- 
terrifying as they are -- are a fact of life in California, just like traffic 
jams and cellular phones. Love it or leave it. One of my favorite bumper 
sticker slogans is, "Welcome to California . . . now get out," to which my wife 
promptly replies, "Gladly." 
</P>
<P>
 Except it's not that easy. 
</P>
<P>
 My family came to the Golden State before anyone knew there was gold in them 
thar hills. Our ancestors were the sorts who dueled with pistols on the dunes 
of San Francisco over personal affronts. They met their ends in violent and 
romantic ways, but never, so far as anyone can tell, in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake, though: This shaker scared the bejabbers out of me and likely 
rattled the bones of my long-dead California forebears. My wife tells me that 
all I did during the initial jolt was hold onto her as I muttered "Oh, God" 
over and over and over. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm still not sure how she heard me over her screaming. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 30 of the most frightening seconds of our lives, most of what we owned 
was flung about as if in a blender -- including us. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedding dishes we had unpacked just a few nights before were smashed to bits 
on the kitchen linoleum. The refrigerator dumped its contents and then promptly 
stopped working. Pictures tumbled in shards of glass or spun on the walls like 
something out of "Mr. Toad's Wild Ride." A seven-foot-tall wood armoire tipped 
over onto the coffee table, wrecking both. Carefully alphabetized books and 
compact discs lay in piles -- "Return of the Native" mixed in with The 
Cranberries and Voice of the Beehive. 
</P>
<P>
 But the delicate crystal champagne glasses we used to toast each other at our 
wedding survived untouched and uncracked, almost as if to remind us that the 
vows we made to each other were stronger than the seismic forces that pummeled 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 On the whole, our experience was not all that much different from thousands of 
others. The earth shook and all of us shook along with it. We held each other 
and shut our eyes in the deafening darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 Random possessions were destroyed: a dining table, a set of margarita glasses. 
Others survived: a crystal vase, a cookie jar, a wall clock. Death snatched the 
sleeping from their beds, but left neighbors unmolested. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a humbling reminder that we are transients whose bonds to life and to 
the earth are tenuous at best. 
</P>
<P>
 Easy come, easy go. 
</P>
<P>
 It is easy to look back now and understand how lucky we are. Our home is safe 
and dry, while others sleep on cots in gymnasiums. We wake up together every 
morning, while others mourn the empty side of the bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, my wife still has trouble sleeping through the night. Every time the 
cat jumps on the bed, she sits up and braces for another shock. "Just when I'm 
beginning to feel comfortable here, this happens," she said the other day, as 
we scrounged together enough cups and plates to eat breakfast. The quake has 
shaken her faith in the ground beneath us. 
</P>
<P>
 I could only shrug. Like most natives, I deny the danger, for better or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 It was scary. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is also over. 
</P>
<P>
 As we jogged through our neighborhood one evening, I harped on and on about 
the mechanics of earthquakes, hoping my A-minus college geology would help her 
understand what happened beneath our feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't care," she finally said in exasperation. "It doesn't make me 
feel any better." 
</P>
<P>
 Only time will. 
</P>
<P>
 And over time our lives will gradually return to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, though, we both make a point of reminding ourselves how much we have 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 We call each other more often during the day, just to say hi. 
</P>
<P>
 We are thankful for quiet nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the cat gets more attention than usual -- something I never thought 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the fragile crystal that survived the shaking, I hope our new marriage -- 
delicate and unpredictable -- will survive the tensions and fears that persist 
like constant, unsettling aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 As it toppled buildings, the quake also knocked away the inconsequential 
detritus that builds up in any relationship. There are cracks in the drywall, 
to be sure -- fear, insecurity, powerlessness -- but our structure appears to 
be sound, a green-tag romance in current terms. 
</P>
<P>
 We support each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe our marriage is on pretty firm ground after all.

TRAIN KILLS BOY WHO RODE BIKE ONTO TRACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

 Ignoring the engineer's warning signals, a boy rode his bicycle around a 
railroad crossing barrier Wednesday and was killed by a Metrolink train 
traveling about 50 m.p.h., authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told Metrolink officials and police officers that the unidentified 
youth ignored all warning signs not to cross the tracks at Sunland Boulevard 
and San Fernando Road, near the Burbank station. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just rode around the lowered gates," Metrolink spokesman Peter Hidalgo 
said. "Our engineer was blowing his horn and the youth just ignored it." 
</P>
<P>
 The engineer of the Los Angeles-bound train came to a stop about a quarter of 
a mile south of the accident, Hidalgo said. The victim's body was thrown about 
200 feet by the impact, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The train was slowing as it approached the station about 6 p.m., Hidalgo said. 
The posted speed limit in the area for Metrolink trains is 59 m.p.h., he added. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the 30 passengers or crew members aboard the train, carrying 
passengers from Santa Clarita, was injured, Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a continuing safety program, the agency conducted safety 
presentations at schools in the Sunland area about three months ago, Hidalgo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The death occurred about eight miles south of a stretch of track where four 
lives were lost in an eight-month period. There have been 14 fatal accidents 
since Metrolink began operation in October, 1992, half of them declared 
suicides by the Los Angeles County coroner's office.

PROSECUTION RESTS IN PAROLEE'S RAPE TRIAL; COURTS: MONETTE JOHNSON IS ACCUSED 
OF 28 FELONIES STEMMING FROM A SERIES OF ATTACKS IN THE VALLEY IN 1991 AND 
1992. 
</P>

<P>
 The prosecution ended its case Wednesday against a prison parolee accused of 
raping half a dozen women during a series of late-night attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Monette Johnson, 35, is on trial for 28 felonies, including rape, sodomy and 
robbery, stemming from a series of attacks in San Fernando Valley residences in 
1991 and early 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In a trial interrupted for a week and a half because of the Northridge 
earthquake, a Van Nuys Superior Court jury has heard the victims testify about 
the assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every one of them is very relieved this case has gone to trial, that they've 
been able to testify to try to put this all behind them," said Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Phillip H. Rabichow, the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 Four victims who won court orders forcing testing of Johnson for acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome have been alerted that they had been possibly 
exposed to the HIV virus. But the notifications from the county Department of 
Health did not specify the source of the exposure because of state 
confidentiality laws. Other victims, including nine whose cases lacked enough 
evidence to prosecute, are legally not entitled to the information. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's medical status was not part of the prosecution's case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can say the only mention of AIDS or HIV was when one of the victims" 
testified that she attempted to scare away her attacker by claiming that she 
was infected with HIV, Rabichow said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this didn't discourage him." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one of the victims could identify Johnson as her assailant. Another woman 
identified the defendant during a live lineup after hearing his voice, but she 
was not able to do so at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's fingerprints were found at one crime scene, according to testimony, 
and items stolen during each sexual assault were found in Johnson's Lake View 
Terrace apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 And DNA evidence conclusively shows that the odds are extremely remote -- 1 in 
43 million in five of the attacks -- that someone other than Johnson is the 
rapist, according to the testimony. This figure is obtained by comparing the 
genetic material in Johnson's blood with the DNA in the semen collected after 
the rapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney M. David Houchin will challenge the DNA evidence next week.

RIORDAN REFUSES TO REOPEN LANDFILL FOR QUAKE RUBBLE; SANITATION: COMPANY OFFERS 
TO TEMPORARILY ACCEPT DEBRIS FOR FREE AT SUNSHINE CANYON DUMP. BUT MAYOR SAYS 
FACILITIES SERVING L.A. ARE ADEQUATE. 
</P>

<P>
 As Los Angeles sanitation officials study the possibility of hauling trash to 
Utah, Mayor Richard Riordan has rejected a proposal to temporarily reopen a 
controversial landfill north of Granada Hills to accept earthquake rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's office notified operators of the closed Sunshine Canyon Landfill on 
Tuesday that there is no immediate need to reopen the dump because adequate 
landfill space exists for the debris created by the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the landfill's operator, Browning Ferris Industries, called 
the decision "preposterous," saying BFI is willing to take rubble for free from 
public agencies for 30 days while the Utah landfill will charge $45 per ton. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they say they can take it to Utah for $45 per ton, then we can do it for 
$45 cheaper," said BFI spokesman Arnie Berghoff. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials said that the Utah trash-hauling idea is only being 
considered as a long-term landfill alternative and that landfills serving Los 
Angeles have enough capacity to meet the immediate needs after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if the city decides to implement the Utah dumping proposal to accept 
earthquake rubble, federal emergency funding may be available to subsidize the 
cost, said Lillian Kawasaki, general manager of the city's Environmental 
Affairs Department, which regulates landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 A study by city and state agencies concluded that landfills in the area are 
accepting only 38% of the maximum amounts allowed under emergency limits issued 
after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on that study, Riordan decided not to exercise his emergency powers to 
grant a permit allowing Sunshine Canyon to open because "it just wasn't 
needed," said Riordan spokeswoman Annette Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 BFI first proposed the idea of reopening a portion of the landfill to 
earthquake rubble in letters to Riordan and all 15 members of the City Council 
three days after the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The 200-acre landfill, which straddles the city-county boundary in the Santa 
Susana Mountains above Granada Hills, closed in September, 1991, after its 
operating permit expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Berghoff said BFI would temporarily open the city portion of the landfill -- 
part of it lies in the unincorporated county and part in the city -- to accept 
earthquake rubble and charge no dumping fees to city, county and state agencies 
and local residents for 30 days. Private firms would be charged the regular fee 
of about $20 per ton. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Hal Bernson, whose district includes part of the landfill and 
who has worked for years to close it, has vehemently opposed the idea, calling 
it "just another way to get in." 
</P>
<P>
 "They were closed because they violated a lot of rules and now they have an 
application to reopen the landfill," Bernson said, referring to zoning 
violations against BFI in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson proposed his alternative Tuesday when he instructed sanitation 
officials to investigate the idea of hauling trash by rail to Utah to meet the 
city's long-term landfill needs once current landfills reach capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Kawasaki said she plans to schedule a meeting soon with city officials to 
investigate the feasibility of Bernson's trash-hauling idea.

YAROSLAVSKY AMASSES $700,000 IN BID FOR COUNTY SUPERVISOR'S JOB; ELECTIONS: THE 
COUNCILMAN SAYS HE WANTS LIMITS ON CONTRIBUTIONS. AN OPPONENT LABELS HIM A 
HYPOCRITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, an outspoken advocate of campaign 
finance reform, has amassed more than $700,000 in his bid for county 
supervisor, much of it in donations of more than $1,000 from special interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Telephoning prominent lobbyists, developers and other potential contributors 
to support his candidacy, Yaroslavsky raised more than half the money -- about 
$400,000 -- during the last three weeks of 1993. The rest of the funds are left 
over from his previous City Council campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky, who kicked off his campaign last month with a pledge to push for 
limits on political contributions, acknowledged in an interview Wednesday that 
his fund-raising task was made much easier by the absence of restrictions on 
county elections. Candidates for City Council cannot accept more than $500 from 
a single donor, a law that does not apply to county elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Yaroslavsky was able to raise $400,000 in three weeks from 189 
contributors, instead of the 800 donors he would have had to persuade under 
city laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly made it less time-consuming," Yaroslavsky said. "I don't think 
the county rules are the best. . . . But I have to play by county rules because 
everyone else is playing by those rules." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Yaroslavsky's only opponent so far, retired Los Angeles 
firefighter Don Wallace, has raised about $10,000 in his bid for the 3rd 
District seat, which includes Hollywood, parts of western Los Angeles, Santa 
Monica and the San Fernando Valley. Incumbent Supervisor Ed Edelman is retiring 
next year after his fifth term in office, leaving the seat vacant for the first 
time in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline to enter the race is March 11. The primary is June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace, who received most of his contributions in increments of $100 or less, 
said Yaroslavsky was being hypocritical for promising reform while benefiting 
from the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 "This race is going to be like David against Goliath," Wallace said. "People 
are absolutely disgusted by the obscene amounts of money that career 
politicians raise to keep themselves in office. And there's going to be a 
backlash against it." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky defended his actions, saying his record of more than 18 years on 
the council proves that he can take money without being influenced. He pointed 
out that he has been endorsed by Geoff Cowan, former chairman of the citizens 
ethics commission that drafted the city's tough campaign finance laws. 
</P>
<P>
 And Yaroslavsky renewed his promise to seek campaign finance limits on county 
elections if he is elected, saying his first move would be to restrict 
donations by companies seeking or holding county contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 However, this time around, Yaroslavsky accepted donations from several county 
contractors, including BKK Corp., which runs a landfill in West Covina and 
contributed $5,000; Browning-Ferris Industries, which provides the county with 
chemical toilets and contributed $4,000, and Five Star Parking, which operates 
county parking lots and gave Yaroslavsky $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky's single largest donation -- $25,000 -- came from communications 
mogul Jerry A. Perenchio. Other contributors include such prominent lobbyists 
as Morey/Seymour Associates, which represents the developer who wants to build 
the controversial Canyon Oaks Estates project in Topanga Canyon and donated 
$1,000, and Maureen Kindel, who also contributed $1,000 and represents a large 
bond underwriting company that has sought county contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky's huge war chest is a key weapon in his continuing battle to ward 
off challenges from political or financial heavyweights, including entrepreneur 
Nikolas Patsaouras, who is weighing a bid for the seat, said Parke Skelton, one 
of Yaroslavsky's political consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patsaouras could put a million bucks into the campaign and not miss it," 
Skelton said. "Zev also intends to run a full-fledged, aggressive campaign to 
avoid a runoff with any of the other challengers that are sure to file in a 
race like this, and that costs money." 
</P>
<P>
 Patsaouras said that if he decides to run, he will raise the funds from 
supporters.

SEMINARY HOSTS DISPLACED STUDENTS; EDUCATION: CLASSES FROM NEARBY ALEMANY HIGH 
RESUME. PROSPECTS ARE DIM FOR A RETURN TO THE CAMPUS' QUAKE-DAMAGED BUILDINGS. 
</P>

<P>
 The 1,600-member student body of quake-wracked Alemany Catholic High School in 
Mission Hills resumed classes Wednesday in temporary quarters at a nearby high 
school-level Catholic seminary -- with a treat offered by the teen-age 
priests-in-training. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 seminarians -- dressed in navy blue sweaters, ties and khaki pants 
-- handed out a chocolate sucker to 11th- and 12th-graders arriving for morning 
classes and to the 9th- and 10th-graders arriving for afternoon classes. 
</P>
<P>
 While he said he was "real satisfied" with the smooth resumption of classes at 
Our Lady Queen of Angels High School Seminary, Alemany Vice Principal Robert 
Gebauer said prospects are dim for ever returning to Alemany's buildings on 
Rinaldi Street. Only three of 12 buildings there are usable, and only one of 
those three contains classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to build a new school and the archdiocese is beginning to 
agree," Gebauer said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, temporary relief was provided by the seminary, which is next 
to the San Fernando Mission and a short walk from the Alemany campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Dick Martini, rector of the seminary, said beds and other furniture 
were removed from dormitories on the east side of the seminary campus to make 
space for 31 classrooms. The dormitories have been used by church retreat 
organizations and other church activities in recent years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Pat Tobin, an Alemany counselor, praised the "cooperative, adaptive 
spirit" of the students on the first day back. 
</P>
<P>
 One student conceded, however, that it was difficult to find her classes, 
despite carrying around a map of the seminary's maze of tile-roofed, one-story 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The classes are only a half-hour long, and I was 15 minutes late to each 
class," senior Celerina Aguirre joked with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, Alemany teachers will begin teaching in 26 trailer-like movable 
classrooms, the first three of which were set in place on the seminary grounds 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Church officials do not expect any problem with the increased mingling of 
young "expectant fathers," as 14-year-old seminarian Joseph Reyes quipped, and 
the girls of the coeducational Alemany student body. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alemany has come over before to use our swimming pool, and seminarians have 
been over there socializing at their football games," Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at Our Lady Queen of Angels Seminary have the chance to explore 
whether they want to become priests while getting an accredited high school 
education, administrators said. About half the graduates continue studies at 
the Los Angeles Archdiocese's St. John's College Seminary in Camarillo.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; THEATRE GROUP MAKES PLANS TO REPAIR EL PORTAL; 
LANDMARKS: ACTORS ALLEY SEEKS FUNDS TO FIX $1.5 MILLION IN QUAKE DAMAGE TO THE 
NOHO ARTS DISTRICT ANCHOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Facing more than $1.5 million in estimated damage to its earthquake-hobbled 
home at the El Portal Theatre in North Hollywood, Actors Alley Repertory 
Theatre has begun to seek money to repair the structure and keep the theater 
organization operating. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, concerns persist about how soon the facility -- the linchpin 
of the ambitious NoHo arts district, the first of its kind in the San Fernando 
Valley -- will be operational. 
</P>
<P>
 In one indication that the company is not planning to close or go into hiatus, 
the group is moving ahead with plans to announce its 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we will find a temporary venue before we reopen at the El Portal," said 
Actors Alley artistic director Jeremiah Morris. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Actors Alley was close to securing a Valley-based venue for its 
March 1 opening of Peter Lefcourt's play, "The Audit," and a late March opening 
for James Thurber's "The Male Animal." 
</P>
<P>
 Another indication that the show would go on was the unanimous decision by 
Actors Alley's 23-member board of directors Jan. 27 to accelerate what had been 
originally planned as a five- to six-year fund-raising plan. The nonprofit 
organization is immediately applying for a loan from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, while raising between $30,000 and $40,000 from private 
sources for the current season's immediate needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The maximum FEMA loan for which the group is eligible, said Actors Alley 
managing director Robert Caine, happens to be $1.5 million -- the approximate 
repair cost for the El Portal. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the company, which subleases the building, nor the main leaseholder, 
El Portal Partners, carried earthquake insurance, Caine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caine did not anticipate problems in securing the full loan, despite demands 
for far larger government loan amounts from such institutions as Cal State 
Northridge, the Los Angeles Coliseum and other key public facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the quake, the former vaudeville house and cinema, built in 1926 at 5269 
Lankershim Blvd., had been undergoing $300,000 worth of redesign and 
restoration, and was "95% ready" for the early February reopening, said site 
project manager Terry Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 The temblor's force brought most of the theater's ceiling crashing to the 
floor. Richard McCann, architect of the El Portal face lift, said that although 
the fallen ceiling did not damage the newly designed "arena" stage built inside 
the auditorium, it did release a large amount of asbestos throughout the 
building and the lobby area, while damaging some of the auditorium's 
decades-old decorative wall art, loosening the large chandelier, and twisting 
and pulling apart the theater's old electrical duct work. The building's south 
and east facades were also damaged, McCann said. 
</P>
<P>
 A complete assessment of interior damage cannot be made until the asbestos is 
removed, which is expected to cost $275,000 and take four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the long term, officials don't expect the El Portal to open for another 
year to 15 months. Caine said this factors in five or six months of repair work 
and an equal amount of time for fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake's effect, which was also seriously felt at another key NoHo arts 
district theater, American Renegade Theatre, "is certainly a setback," said 
Fred Bower, chairman of the NoHo art district committee. "Actors Alley's 
presence at the El Portal is an anchor of the district. But I would term it a 
knockdown, not a knockout."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CLASSES MOVE OUTDOORS AT COLLEGE OF THE 
CANYONS; EDUCATION: STUDENTS TAKE COURSES IN 21 TENTS ERECTED AFTER THE JAN. 17 
EARTHQUAKE DAMAGED CAMPUS BUILDINGS. 
</P>

<P>
 College of the Canyons students who wished that they could be outside rather 
than in a stuffy classroom may be having second thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake caused $3.2 million in damage to the campus and delayed 
the start of the spring semester by a week.Many of the college's 6,500 students 
are taking courses out of 21 large tents erected on the campus's upper practice 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most students are affected. There are very few who aren't," said Sue Bozman, 
spokeswoman for the Valencia campus. "If they are going full time, with four or 
five classes, they're taking at least one class in a tent." 
</P>
<P>
 A few science building classrooms were approved for occupancy Wednesday, and 
the campus library is slated to reopen next week. The L building that houses 
science labs was not damaged, but has been closed while workers remove spilled 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 White with primary-color stripes, the tents give the field the look of a 
circus grounds. Bozman said officials hope to get out of the makeshift 
classrooms before rain comes, but courses will continue even in wet weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tents are kind of festive and it's nice on a warm day, but yesterday it 
was cold and it was tough to get comfortable," Bozman said. "We're operating 
and that's great, but it's not the best way to operate." 
</P>
<P>
 Ongoing renovation projects at the college have made recovery from the 
6.6-magnitude earthquake smoother. Administration and counseling offices on the 
first floor and computer labs on the second floor of the damaged C building 
were already slated to move to other parts of the campus by the end of the 
semester. Students are still displaced from classrooms on the third floor of 
that building.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; TAPS PLANNED FOR VINTAGE JET FIGHTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last two F-104 jets in use by a government agency will go out with a sonic 
boom today in a retirement ceremony at NASA's Dryden Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyover event, originally scheduled for Tuesday, was postponed when one of 
the jets had engine trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Built by Lockheed in 1954, the F-104 was the first aircraft to travel at twice 
the speed of sound, roughly 1,400 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Although built for combat, the F-104, nicknamed Starfighter, has been used by 
NASA in research and test missions designed to improve technology in both 
military and civilian aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Though still in use in Taiwan, Turkey and Italy, the F-104s have been replaced 
by F/A-18s in the United States because of the high cost of replacement parts 
for the older jet, said NASA spokesman Don Nolan. 
</P>
<P>
 The F-104 cost $1.4 million when built, compared with $30 million for the 
F/A-18s.

UCLA WITH THE CREAM; USC FAILS TO RISE; BRUINS: DEFENSE, REBOUNDING AND RUNNING 
GAME ARE THE KEYS FOR HARRICK'S NO. 4-RANKED TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Now that they're 14-1, fresh from holding the No. 1 ranking at least for a 
week and looking for the most part as smooth as Ed O'Bannon's shaved head, UCLA 
probably ought to go ahead and ask itself one very sensitive question: 
</P>
<P>
 Will success spoil the Bruins? 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, it could happen. Take for instance Jim Harrick. Normally, the UCLA coach 
appears at his weekly news conference wearing shorts, sneakers and a jacket, 
looking as if he had just lettered in water polo. This week, Harrick showed up 
in slacks, shiny black shoes, a gray checked jacket and a stylish black 
T-shirt, as if he had just stepped out of the green room for a guest spot on 
Letterman. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, make that Roy Firestone's show on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
 Joked Firestone: "He was trying to look stylish, but I don't think that word 
is in his dictionary." 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes for Harrick and UCLA. You know you've made it when they start 
poking fun at you. 
</P>
<P>
 With a straight face, Harrick offered his assessment of tonight's game at 
Pauley Pavilion against USC and the one Saturday afternoon in South Bend, Ind., 
against Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's another difficult week for us . . . but they all are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Excuse me, but what has been so difficult about this season? Even after 
Sunday's 85-70 loss to California, the Bruins are still outscoring the other 
teams by 17 points a game, outrebounding them by eight, blocking three times as 
many shots and looking very much like a team destined for something big by 
tournament time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins are the best-shooting team in the Pacific 10 Conference, which they 
also lead in rebounding and rebounding margin, and have held opponents to a 
lower shooting percentage than any other team. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago at this time, the Bruins were 11-4, Charles O'Bannon was in high 
school and George Zidek had 18 field goals, 41 fewer than he has now. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing like the present at UCLA, at least in modern times, which 
began after John Wooden's 10th and last NCAA title in 1975. Most likely, 
Harrick is correct when he says the games will be tougher and the results a lot 
closer the rest of the way in the Pac-10 race, but the Bruins might be more 
prepared for the test because they're a lot further along than most people 
figured they would be. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, after the Bruins defeated Arizona and Arizona State, UCLA earned 
its first No. 1 ranking in 11 years. They're down to No. 4 now, after the 
defeat by Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick said that's probably about right, even if he never saw it coming. "I 
didn't think we were probably good enough to be No. 1 in the country at any 
time of the year, or be 14-1," he said. "But it's been a pleasant surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 So what has gone right for UCLA? "Defense, rebounding and the running game," 
Harrick said. "The defense hasn't been great all the time, but it has been 
consistent. Those three things are probably the reason we are where we are 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
 If Tyus Edney is responsible for running the fast break, the rebounding and 
defensive burdens are more evenly distributed, but mostly they belong as part 
of the O'Bannon factor. Charles has given a flair to the Bruins, which might be 
as important as his ability to run the floor, block shots and defend in the 
front court. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is Ed O'Bannon who has stepped up to become the key Bruin. Against 
Cal, he matched his season high with 24 points. He also had 19 rebounds, the 
most by any UCLA player in 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed O'Bannon has gone over 20 points seven times this season and is third in 
the Pac-10 in scoring, rebounding and blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Unofficially, he also is first at UCLA in leadership, which pleases his coach 
to no end. Said Harrick: "Ed O'Bannon is all about winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed O'Bannon said that just about sums it up. After the California game, he was 
asked if the pressure of the No. 1 ranking was off as a result of the defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to continue on Thursday," he said. "I'll say it again, we're going 
to come out and play as hard as we possibly can, whether we are No. 1 or No. 
101." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the fallout from losing to Cal, USC's George Raveling said UCLA might 
wind up benefiting from it. "It could be a blessing in disguise, take a little 
bit of pressure off and lessen people's expectations of them," Raveling said. 
"I tend to think Jim might be a little bit relieved." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, no he isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Make no mistake about it, I'd rather win than lose, have the ball than not 
have the ball, take the last shot than not take the last shot," Harrick said. 
"I never ever thought we would go undefeated, but I'll take where we are right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Who wouldn't?

UCLA WITH THE CREAM; USC FAILS TO RISE; TROJANS: DESPITE 10-2 START AND FOUR 
TOUTED FRESHMEN, RAVELING'S TEAM IS FAILING CHEMISTRY TEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Riding a five-game slump into tonight's showdown with UCLA at Pauley Pavilion, 
USC is not on the type of streak it had imagined at the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 With several key players back from last season's National Invitation 
Tournament team, along with four highly touted freshmen, the Trojans had high 
expectations for this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I envisioned this game differently," said Lorenzo Orr, USC's leading scorer 
and rebounder. "I saw both teams coming in rated high in the country, as far as 
rankings were concerned. I definitely didn't see us like this." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first six weeks, the Trojans appeared close to living up to their 
potential. Starting out 3-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference for the first time 
since 1979, they had a 10-2 overall record at that point. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, however, the season has fallen apart for USC. Beginning with a 
30-point loss at Washington State, the Trojans have played more like an 
inexperienced team in need of some good luck than as the Pac-10 force they had 
hoped to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "When your back is up against the wall, you have to come up with something 
positive," Coach George Raveling said. "I told the team in practice the other 
day that even if the clock on the wall was broken with both hands stuck on 12, 
you still would have the right time two times a day. You just have to look at 
things from a positive perspective and not feel sorry for yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their current 10-7 record, the Trojans still seem to have enough 
talent to win in the Pac-10, but they need to find the right chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting consistent backcourt play and outside shooting would be a good start. 
Point guards Burt Harris and Damaine Powell have both played well at times, but 
have come up short in a conference dominated by guards such as Jason Kidd of 
California, Khalid Reeves of Arizona and Stevin Smith of Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans are at their best when Orr, Mark Boyd and Tremayne Anchrum are 
effective inside. However, the lack of reliable outside shooting has hampered 
the Trojans' half-court offense. 
</P>
<P>
 When able to get clear shots, sophomore Brandon Martin has proven to be a 
scoring threat, but opponents have too often been able to shut him down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no secret that we have had problems with our half-court offense," said 
Martin, who is averaging 13.5 points. "We have a lot of new guys and we're 
still learning. But at some point, we have to step up and show some growth. 
We're that close (to) being a good team." 
</P>
<P>
 For freshmen Avondre Jones, Jaha Wilson, Stais Boseman and Claude Green, the 
lack of steady playing time has been especially disappointing. In 17 games, 
they have combined for averages of 15 points and 8.4 rebounds, well below the 
numbers they had anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has not been the type of season I expected," said Jones, a 6-foot-11 
center, who is averaging three points and three rebounds in 12 minutes a game. 
"It's been frustrating for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling acknowledges USC's freshmen have struggled, but he is not about to 
make radical changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are probably all a lot better than they have had an opportunity to 
show," Raveling said. "Some of the blame falls on my shoulders because I'm not 
totally convinced in my own mind that I've done the best coaching job with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tend to have a format that I feel comfortable with, and I tend to try to 
get people to fit into that format. In this case, I may be trying to get a 
round ball to fit into a square peg. If in fact this is the case, the problem 
is more with me than with them, but after 31 years you get comfortable with a 
system that has been productive. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the teaching process I value is one that doesn't just take place on the 
basketball court. It spills onto other areas. I have my own style -- my own 
management style and my own coaching style -- and I think some players adjust 
quicker than others. Just about every kid I've had had some difficulty at the 
beginning, but at the end it all worked out for the best."

KERRIGAN GETS OK TO COMPETE; OLYMPICS: AFTER HER PRACTICE, JUDGES SAY SHE IS 
PHYSICALLY READY TO SKATE AT LILLEHAMMER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<P>
 A panel of figure skating judges pronounced Nancy Kerrigan physically and 
mentally fit for the Olympics, despite an attack last month that knocked her 
out of the national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there were any doubt or any questions about Nancy Kerrigan's skating 
condition, she answered them for us this afternoon," said Chuck Foster, 
secretary to the U.S. Olympic Committee and one of the four judges who watched 
Kerrigan in a closed workout at her practice rink. "We expect that she is going 
to do very well in Norway." 
</P>
<P>
 In Portland, Ore., Jeff Gillooly, ex-husband of skating champion Tonya 
Harding, met with investigators at the FBI office one day after he pleaded 
guilty to racketeering in the Jan. 6 attack on Kerrigan, whose right leg was 
smashed with a collapsible baton just before the national championships in 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, ABC News reported that the USOC is planning a hearing next week on 
Harding's Olympic eligibility, but a USOC spokesman denied it. U.S. Figure 
Skating Assn. officials are expected to have a recommendation on Harding by the 
end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan's selection to the Olympic team had been contingent upon Wednesday's 
evaluation of her skating. The judges said they were impressed by Kerrigan's 
stamina after she skated her long program twice, which Foster said "people in 
the best of conditions haven't done." 
</P>
<P>
 "What we saw was not only good physical condition with a high level of 
stamina, but her mental condition was very good," said Kathleen Kelly-Cutone, a 
judge who was national collegiate champion in 1987, the year before Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan left the rink several hours after her performance, smiling broadly 
but declining to answer questions. She is to perform in a charity exhibition 
Friday night at Northeastern University. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding also skated Wednesday at a suburban Portland shopping mall, but she 
fell the first two times she tried her trademark triple axel before 
successfully landing a third one. Her workout lasted only half an hour because 
she had trouble starting her truck and was 45 minutes late to practice.

JIM MURRAY: NFL SHOULD KICK AROUND WAYS TO LIMIT FIELD GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The NFL has a few big problems other than how to keep Buffalo out of its 
showcase game, the Super Bowl, for at least the next few years. Lord knows, 
that's big enough. One year, Thurman Thomas forgets his helmet, the next he 
forgets the football. For Buffalo, the Super Bowl is a soup kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 But the major threat to the professional football game, it seems to me, is not 
Super Bowl personnel or even salary cap. It's how to get the foot out of 
football. 
</P>
<P>
 The field goal has threatened to take over the game, turn it into soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the commissioner addressed the problem in Atlanta. It has cheapened the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 It is almost like letting the bunt equal a home run in baseball. It is 
rewarded way out of proportion to its degree of difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at it this way: A team recruits a whole lockerful of the resident giants 
of the planet -- powerful, fast, resourceful, athletic young men. It gives them 
a football and points them toward a goal line defended by another passel of 
powerful, fast, resourceful young giants. 
</P>
<P>
 They lock in combat, painstakingly gain yards. They pass, block, run. If 
they're lucky, they finally cross a goal line at a major cost in nosebleeds, 
concussions, hamstrings, pinched nerves and limp-offs. They get six points. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, if they reach a stalemate, some 155-pound ex-tie salesman or soccer 
player, without shoulder pads or game shoes, flicks a windbreaker off his 
narrow chest, runs out, sweeps his foot -- and puts three points on the board. 
His nose isn't bleeding, his ears aren't ringing, he has all his teeth and 
ears, he'll never have a limp -- but he might leave the game as the leading 
scorer in the history of his franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Karras, the great Detroit tackle, once sneeringly described the breed 
when he noted that he and his teammates played 58 minutes of head-knocking, 
gut-busting football whereupon a "skinny little guy who came to this country on 
a banana boat runs out there and wins the game and gets carried off screaming, 
'I keek a touchdown! I keek a touchdown!' " 
</P>
<P>
 The field goal was an integral -- and deserving -- part of the game in the 
days when the dropkick was in vogue. But when they perfected the hold and the 
placekick, it became a cheaper and cheaper way to score. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps you noted in this year's Super Bowl, played indoors minus any vagrant 
wind currents for or against, a 53-yard field goal was thrown into the mix. 
Guys were being carried off the field in groups, but of the 19 points scored in 
the first half, 12 were bloodless placekicks. There were four touchdowns and 
five field goals scored in the entire game. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-yard field goals are becoming commonplace. There is little doubt that as 
the state of the art advances, it's only a matter of time before they'll be 
kicking them 70 yards or more. 
</P>
<P>
 It has long been the notion in this corner that no playoff or Super Bowl game 
should be decided by an overtime field goal. It puts the premium on the coin 
toss. Whoever gets the ball in OT has merely to advance it a first down or so 
and then kick it through the uprights for the victory. You win the coin flip, 
eight chances out of 10 you win the overtime game. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, it was not too long ago the goal posts were on the goal line in pro 
football. They moved them back because -- guess why? -- field goals were too 
easy! 
</P>
<P>
 They still are. There were 671 field goals in 1993, a 20% increase over the 
561 in '92. Touchdowns decreased from 958 in 1992 to 906 in '93. 
</P>
<P>
 What to do about it? Well, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue has his competition 
committee working on it. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal step would be to reinstitute the two-point conversion, making a 
touchdown worth a potential eight points and increasing the discrepancy between 
it and the field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 That should probably pass with ease at the next league meeting in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 Other solutions are less foregone. One school of thought holds that the reward 
should be greater the longer the distance of the field goal. For instance, make 
the field goal inside the opponents' 20-yard-line count only one point, the 
field goal between the 20 and 40 count two points and anything over 40 yards 
count the obligatory three. 
</P>
<P>
 But the other school of thought holds that this is the opposite of what you 
really want to do. They would make the long field goal count only one point, 
the medium two points and the close-in three points. Their notion is that a 
team should be rewarded for moving the ball close. 
</P>
<P>
 But, you ask, isn't this tampering with the rules? Hey! Tampering with 
football rules is as American as turkey. Recall it wasn't too long ago an 
incomplete pass in the end zone was a touchback and meant the ball went over to 
the other team on its 20-yard line and two incomplete passes in a row resulted 
in a five-yard penalty. They didn't want the game to resemble what they called 
"aerial circuses" in those days, i.e., any game in which one team might throw 
as many as 10 passes. 
</P>
<P>
 No one's going to want to watch a game between dueling kickers who might spend 
the night making field goals from their own 20. You may have seen the hamburger 
commercial in which kickers split the uprights from the roof of the stadium, 
off a passing blimp or off two statues and a flagpole. Given the advancement of 
the craft, it's not so fanciful as it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Devaluing the field goal has to be a priority. Whether you do it by inflating 
the touchdown or other means is moot. You have to find a way to put guys 
nicknamed, "Galloping Ghost," back into deciding games, not guys nicknamed, 
"The Toe," who never touch the football with anything but their foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe we should take a cue from that commercial and have it count only if they 
kick it from the top of the Goodyear dirigible. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, they'll probably start making two out of three.

KWAN WILL GET A TICKET TO SKATE; OLYMPICS: BECAUSE SHE IS AN ALTERNATE, DETAILS 
OF WHEN OR WHERE THE 13-YEAR-OLD WILL GO HAVE NOT BEEN DETERMINED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michelle Kwan of Torrance has been notified by U.S. Figure Skating Assn. 
officials that they will send her a plane ticket. They have not, however, told 
her when or where she is going. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the association announced Wednesday that Kwan will travel to Norway 
to train for the Feb. 12-27 Winter Olympics, officials acknowledged that they 
have to work out numerous details, including her exact destination. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Kwan, as an alternate, is not allowed to live in the athletes' village 
with the other figure skaters or to train with them at the official practice 
rink, other accommodations are being sought, preferably 80 miles south of here 
in Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
 But if they cannot arrange ice time in the Norwegian capital, they will have 
to look elsewhere. A spokesman for the Kwan family said Copenhagen and London 
have been mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know quite when we're going or where or what else is happening," said 
Frank Carroll, who coaches Kwan at Lake Arrowhead's Ice Castle International 
Training Center. "All I know is we're going. Now, at least we can get 
organized, do our laundry and pack." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the larger question of whether Kwan will actually compete in the 
Games still looms. 
</P>
<P>
 When she became the first alternate for the two berths the United States has 
in the women's competition here by finishing second to Tonya Harding in last 
month's national championships, it appeared that Kwan might replace Nancy 
Kerrigan. The defending champion withdrew from the U.S. competition because of 
knee injuries sustained in an assault the day before the skating began. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that judges have decided Kerrigan can compete, it is more likely that 
Kwan will be called upon to replace Harding. A hearing panel appointed by the 
USFSA will reconvene Friday to decide whether it should recommend Harding's 
removal from the team because of code of ethics violations, including her 
failure to report immediately all that she knew about the assault on Kerrigan 
to law enforcement authorities. The U.S. Olympic Committee has until Feb. 21, 
two days before the women's skating competition begins, to substitute Kwan for 
Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll said the USFSA has discussed Feb. 12 and Feb. 16 as possible departure 
dates for Kwan. 
</P>
<P>
 "In light of developments in the last month concerning both Nancy Kerrigan and 
Tonya Harding, we felt it would be a sensible move to send Michelle Kwan to 
Norway," Claire Ferguson, the association's president, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michelle is still a relatively young competitor, and by allowing her to train 
in Norway, we hope she will have a chance to get acclimated and prepared in 
case she is called upon to compete." 
</P>
<P>
 If she competes, Kwan, 13, would become the youngest U.S. figure skater to 
participate in the Winter Olympics. "The only thing that has changed is that 
now I get to train in Norway, and that will be fun," Kwan said.

USC GETS HIGH MARKS IN ITS RECRUITING CLASS; FOOTBALL: TROJANS SIGN TOP RUNNING 
BACK, KICKER AND DEFENSIVE LINEMAN. BRUINS GET EISENHOWER'S THOMPKINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 John Robinson's first full recruiting season since he took over as USC's 
football coach last year apparently left him so drained that he declined 
comment on the class of 29 players he signed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just too tired to talk to everyone," a school spokeswoman said. "He 
wants to rest." 
</P>
<P>
 When he replaced Larry Smith early last year, Robinson had only a month to 
sign 12 players to scholarships, and his top prospect, running back Saladin 
McCullough of Pasadena Muir High, still has not qualified academically. The 
Trojans finished last season with an 8-5 record and a victory over Utah in the 
Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Robinson had a year to reacquaint himself with local high school 
and junior college coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 In hopes of getting immediate help at several positions, Robinson signed 10 
junior college players, more than any other school in the Pacific 10 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is three Southern California high school players -- running back Rodney 
Sermons of La Puente Bishop Amat, kicker Adam Abrams of La Jolla The Bishop's 
and defensive tackle Darrell Russell of St. Augustine in San Diego -- who are 
expected to have the biggest impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Sermons, who rushed for more than 1,000 yards in each of the last two seasons 
while leading Bishop Amat to a 26-1 record, should help in the backfield. The 
Trojans also need a kicker, and Abrams, a consensus All-American, had field 
goals of 50 and 52 yards, and converted all 30 extra-point attempts last 
season. Russell, 6 feet 4 and 288 pounds, is a quick defensive lineman who had 
15 sacks as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson also announced that sophomore Brad Otton, who passed for 2,307 yards 
last season at Division I-AA Weber State, is transferring to USC and will be 
immediately eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA, Coach Terry Donahue took advantage of the Bruins' appearance in the 
Rose Bowl to recruit well in Southern California. Of the 17 players who signed 
national letters of intent with the Bruins, 10 are from local high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in that group is Glenn Thompkins, The Times' player of the year. 
Thompkins played quarterback and defensive back at Rialto Eisenhower, leading 
the Eagles to a 14-0 record and the Southern Section Division I championship 
last season. Because he is only 5-9 and 165, Thompkins is expected to play 
either wide receiver or defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA recruited several skill-position players but signed only two linemen, 
Terry Williams of Placentia El Dorado High and Vavae Tata of Honolulu St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did particularly well in the areas of wide receiver and tight end on 
offense, and linebacker and defensive back on defense," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State also recruited well in Southern California, with 11 of its 24 
recruits coming from local high schools, including 6-7 quarterback Steve 
Campbell of Norco.

RECRUITING ROUNDUP; REMPEL TAKES WALK-ON BID FROM UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jason Rempel twice was named first-team All-Valley by The Times. In 1993 he 
was named first-team all-state by Cal-Hi Sports, but all he got from college 
recruiters was the cold shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Many schools have expressed interest in Rempel but none offered the 6-foot-4, 
255-pound tackle from Calabasas High a scholarship until this week. And when 
the only offer came from San Jose State, Rempel gave the Spartans the cold 
shoulder and chose to walk on at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was discouraged last week I wasn't hearing from anybody," said Rempel, 
named the co-most valuable player in the Frontier League. "But then I got a 
call from UCLA on Wednesday. They said they didn't have a scholarship for me, 
but I asked them this week if I could walk on. They said yes and they got me 
into the school." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Rempel wouldn't have been accepted anyway. He carries a 3.0 
grade-point average and scored 1,050 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. The 
Bruins told him they were investing most of their scholarships on defensive 
players and they had only one full ride for an offensive lineman. It went to 
Terry Williams of El Dorado High in Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
 "(San Jose State) was all right, but I had a better feel for UCLA," he said. 
"I've wanted to go there since I was in seventh grade. It's been a dream, and 
now I have a chance. I'm getting all the benefits of the athletes; tutoring, 
first crack at registration. . . . I get everything but the money." 
</P>

 UCLA told Rempel he could earn a scholarship within the next two years with 
ample progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't consider it a risk (turning down San Jose State)," Rempel said. 
"Football is one thing, but it's not the end-all. Maybe I'd be able to play 
next year at San Jose State. But UCLA is a great school and, who knows, maybe 
I'll be playing there in a couple of years."

 Kennedy linebacker Vincent Carthron became the third member of his team to 
commit to play at San Jose State.  
</P>
<P>
 Carthron (6-1, 150) was a standout outside linebacker who missed several games 
last fall after undergoing surgery on his left knee. Carthron has not scored 
the required 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, but San Jose State has agreed 
to accept him as a Proposition 48 player if necessary, Kennedy Coach Bob 
Francola said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Donte Scarbrough and receiver Shaun Dudra already have committed to 
San Jose State.

 Missouri Coach Larry Smith might have a trio of Glendale College football 
players on his roster next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Running backs Jerome Casey and Pathon Rucker could end up with the Tigers if 
they get their Associate in Arts degrees before next fall. And Miguel Gonzalez, 
a 6-3, 225-pound tight end, signed a letter of intent to play at Missouri next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Coach John Cicuto said Casey has orally committed to attend Missouri 
and Rucker has an offer from the same university. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey, a former All-City player at Sylmar High, would be used at defensive 
back by the Tigers, Cicuto said. Casey was hampered by ankle problems last 
season and rushed for 487 yards in seven games for Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Rucker was second in the state in rushing with 1,684 yards, scored 14 
touchdowns and finished as the career rushing leader at Glendale with 2,900 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, a former Grant High standout, had 21 receptions for 237 yards last 
season. 
</P>

<P>
 Chaminade High's Katy Bloodgood signed a letter of intent to play volleyball 
at Georgetown. The 5-7 setter was an All-Mission League selection. Bloodgood 
was also an all-league guard for the Eagles' basketball team.

 Thousand Oaks soccer player Shannon Thomas has committed to play at UCLA. The 
senior midfielder has nine goals and six assists this season.

JUNIOR COLLEGE BASEBALL PREVIEW; WSC DIVIDES, WITH HOPES TO CONQUER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's see now. It's February, so junior college baseball teams throughout the 
state will get rolling this weekend, many in tournament play, others in 
nonconference games. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also time -- surprise! surprise! -- for the ceremonial unveiling of yet 
another schedule change in the Western State Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Prompted by two factors -- money and a bruised ego -- the WSC will operate 
under a new format for conference games for the third consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 "What else is new?" asked Bob Lofrano, the Pierce coach. 
</P>
<P>
 This much is. 
</P>
<P>
 After playing as an 11-team conference the past two seasons, the WSC will 
split into North and South divisions this year. Teams will play four times 
against each school in their division, two at home and two away. 
</P>
<P>
 They also will play each team in the other division once, but this is where 
the books won't balance because the divisions don't have the same number of 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Not yet. But more on that later. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the North Division will be disputed among Moorpark, Oxnard, Ventura, 
Cuesta and Santa Barbara. The South Division will have Canyons, Glendale, 
Pierce, Valley, Bakersfield and Santa Monica. That means North Division teams 
will play 22 conference games, three fewer than South Division squads. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, WSC teams played a three-round, 30-game schedule. Two seasons ago, 
it was 20 conference games, or twice against each opponent. That schedule 
afforded teams ample room for nonconference games within the 36-game season 
limit (not including playoffs) permitted under state rules. But the 30-game 
conference schedule was another story. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the additional conference competition, WSC coaches believed their 
teams were overlooked for playoff consideration, except for the two that 
automatically qualified. Allegedly, coaches in other conferences questioned the 
strength of WSC teams because they did not play enough nonconference games. 
</P>
<P>
 Those sentiments apparently cost Valley a playoff berth last year, even though 
the Monarchs finished tied for second with Pierce and had a 20-16 overall 
record. Pierce advanced to the regionals as the second-place qualifier behind 
WSC champion Canyons because the Brahmas swept their three-game series with 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Coach Chris Johnson questioned the seeding committee's motives, saying 
at the time, "We (WSC) got a slap in the face." 
</P>
<P>
 With the new divisional breakdown, WSC coaches hope that perhaps as many as 
two teams from each division will earn playoff berths. But Johnson and his 
colleagues say there is more to the new schedule than past slights. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest part of it was travel, just flat out finances," Johnson said. 
"Money is tight and that was a big part of the motivation. Those trips to 
Cuesta (in San Luis Obispo) cost a bundle." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Canyons Coach Len Mohney said the push to adopt a more financially 
friendly schedule wasn't altogether developed by the coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not really our idea," Mohney said. "It was more of (a conference-wide) 
administrative idea. But we didn't balk at it." 
</P>
<P>
 By splitting the conference, Cuesta won't have to travel as far to play. And 
it will fuel some of the natural geographical rivalries already in place but 
that have been somewhat lost in the shuffle in the larger conference. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, for instance, Moorpark, Oxnard and Ventura will do battle 
and the Valley area will have Canyons, Glendale, Pierce and Valley engaged in 
potentially intense games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the southernmost team in our division, so it's not going to help us as 
much as far as travel, but it will help Cuesta," Moorpark Coach Ken Wagner 
said. "They won't have to make all those long trips." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Mohney said he is not enamored with the plan even though he accepted 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked playing the (North Division) schools," Mohney said. "I just don't 
like not being able to play those guys as much. The Western State Conference is 
a fun league and it's a shame we can't play each other the same number of 
times." 
</P>
<P>
 Lofrano, however, is willing to trade that experience for less time on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of nice not having to travel that much," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference will make one more minor adjustment next season when Hancock is 
expected to join the ranks.  
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Maria school, now in the Coast Valley Conference that will be 
disbanded after the current school year, will play in the North Division, 
giving each division six teams. It will be just one more change for Ventura 
Coach Gary Anglin, now in his 17th season with the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here so long, I've been through all of them (changes)," he said.

LUCK, NOT LAYOFF, WORKS AGAINST TUGNUTT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Tugnutt -- remember him? -- started in goal for the Mighty Ducks on 
Wednesday night at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 His world has changed considerably since his last start on Jan. 16 against the 
Vancouver Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
 On a personal note, his son, Jacob, was born. On the ice, Guy Hebert was solid 
in goal for five of his six starts. The Ducks went 2-2-2 and found themselves 
battling the Kings for a playoff spot. And now each game seems to mean so much 
more than only two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A loss to the Pacific Division-leading Calgary Flames would figure to come 
with the territory when Tugnutt made his last start. But no longer, and Tugnutt 
made that clear after Wednesday's 4-2 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The layoff didn't hurt as much as all those missed opportunities and fortunate 
bounces for the Flames, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt made 30 saves, but all the postgame talk was about the one that got 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 Or perhaps more accurately, the one the Ducks gave away. Calgary's Robert 
Reichel intercepted a bad clearing pass from Duck defenseman Bill Houlder, 
skated into the Duck zone and fired a shot that glanced off a defender's stick, 
fluttered, dipped, hit the ice, then bounced into the back of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 That bad-hop goal gave Calgary a 3-2 lead and seemed to be the break the 
Flames needed to subdue the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was going to my blocker side," Tugnutt said. "When it went off the stick, 
it went in the opposite direction. Even then I thought I could stop it. It 
caught me off guard." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal was the turning point. When the Ducks began pressing offensively late 
in the game, they gave up a 3-on-1 break and Reichel beat Tugnutt again. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was deeply disappointing to Tugnutt, who missed a two-game trip to 
Toronto and Detroit to be with his wife, Lisa, who was expecting the couple's 
first child at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he sat and watched while Hebert went through a hot streak, losing only 
to St. Louis, 3-2, in overtime in the next three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt finally got a chance to play when he relieved Hebert in a scoreless, 
16-minute appearance of a 5-1 loss to the Kings Saturday at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on the bench wasn't to blame for Wednesday's outcome, Tugnutt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt fine," he said. "It's nice to get out there again. I was looking 
forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Chomping at the bit is probably more like it. Until Hebert's recent streak, 
neither goalie had come close to making six consecutive starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything, going in against the Kings helped give me a chance to get a 
little ice time," Tugnutt said. "I felt comfortable (tonight). I was confident. 
It was just bad luck on the third goal."

<P>
 Orange Coast, the dominant Orange County football team this season, also has 
sent the most players to four-year colleges. The Pirates (8-3) have 13 players 
advancing, including three to Pac-10 schools. 
</P>
<P>
 OCC's Justin Sogoian, who led the Mission Conference in punting, signed with 
UCLA. Israel Ifeanya, a defensive end from Nigeria, is going to USC. Anthoni 
Davis, a defensive back, is headed for Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 Noa Pua, who with Ifeanya gave OCC the quickest defensive ends in the 
conference, signed with San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Mather, who started most of two seasons at quarterback for OCC, is 
attending Tennessee Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback's Scott von der Ahe, the only first-team J.C. Grid-Wire 
All-American from Orange County this season, signed with Iowa. Von der Ahe set 
the Saddleback career mark for tackles with 206 and sacks with 22 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago's Jesse Gomez and George Burge, both powerful offensive 
linemen, signed with USC and New Mexico State. It will be the second trip to a 
Pac-10 school for Gomez, who signed with Oregon in 1990 after playing at Santa 
Ana High. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Caringella, a defensive back from Golden West, signed with Northern 
Illinois, and teammate Tafa Jefferson, another in a long line of standout 
offensive linemen for the Rustlers, signed with Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Nelson (quarterback) and Ryan Roskelly (wide receiver/kick returner) of 
Fullerton also signed. Nelson is going to Mississippi and Roskelly to Memphis 
State. Local Community College Signings

SHAW WILL HAVE KNEE SURGERY, LOST TO CSUN FOR THE SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First baseman Andy Shaw, expected to provide power to a Cal State Northridge 
offense that has few proven hitters, will miss the season because of an injury 
to his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, who has a damaged patellar tendon, is scheduled to have surgery on the 
knee for the second time Tuesday and will be sidelined for up to 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot, 200-pounder had his knee examined Wednesday in Los Angeles by Dr. 
Lewis Yocum of the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic. Shaw was a projected starter 
at first base or designated hitter for the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw was selected the Western State Conference player of the year last spring 
as a freshman at College of the Canyons. He won the WSC triple crown with a 
conference average of .405, with 12 home runs and 51 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw already has used his redshirt season. After graduating from Montclair 
Prep in 1991, he enrolled at Cal State Fullerton, where he injured the knee and 
had surgery for the first time. He later transferred to Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 The knee continued to bother Shaw, however, and Yocum said Wednesday that the 
tendon could rupture if it is not repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, I'm bummed," Shaw said. "I don't want to sit for another year." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said he went through 14 months of rehabilitation after the first surgery, 
which was performed Dec. 11, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge will open the season Friday at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.

 ANTELOPE VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
 CO-COACHES: Tim Fieckert and Joe Watts, second season 
</P>
<P>
 LAST SEASON: 6-26; eighth in Foothill Conference, 5-19 
</P>
<P>
 PLAYERS TO WATCH: When scanning the roster, one name rises to the surface 
immediately -- catcher Jack Cox. The 6-foot-2, 210-pound sophomore was an 
All-Foothill Conference selection last season after leading the team in several 
offensive categories. Cox, from Antelope Valley High, batted .353 with seven 
home runs and 28 runs batted in. However, he committed 14 errors, but Watts 
said Cox has worked hard to improve his defensive skills. Also back are 
shortstop Ryan Branch, third baseman Brandon Yount and right-handed pitcher 
Ryan Wilson. Branch batted .347 and Yount, nephew of Milwaukee Brewer center 
fielder Robin Yount, finished at .231. Wilson was 1-9 with a 4.73 earned-run 
average. He will be in a rotation that will include right-hander Ricardo 
Dominguez, a transfer from Victor Valley. Watts said the other pitching spots 
are undetermined. "They are all freshmen and I can't say much about them yet," 
Watts said. But four players he could mention and who will play regularly are 
first baseman Travis Wilson (.254 with 13 RBIs his senior season at Palmdale 
High in 1991), center fielder Will Wallace (.476, eight home runs, 32 RBIs at 
Quartz Hill High in 1993), utility infielder Eric Cole (.480, seven home runs, 
34 RBIs at Antelope Valley High) and outfielder Jeff Bowne (.357 and 13 RBIs at 
Quartz Hill). 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK: During one stretch last season, the Marauders lost 13 of 14 games, 
and Watts hopes the new crop of players will help turn the program around. "We 
have been down for so long," Watts said. "Our goal is to play at least .500 
ball." The team's defense should be improved but Watts is worried about the 
inexperienced pitching corps. CANYONS 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Len Mohney, eighth season 
</P>
<P>
 LAST SEASON: 29-10; first in Western State Conference, 26-4 
</P>
<P>
 PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Cougars don't have a returning pitcher and will depend 
on six pitchers, five of them fresh off outstanding senior seasons in high 
school, to help them defend their WSC title. Mohney has tabbed right-handers 
Bobby Cowan, Gary Stephenson and Jnani Matson as starters. Cowan was 4-6 with a 
1.66 ERA and 64 strikeouts in 54 1/3 innings at Saugus High, and Stephenson was 
9-4 with an 0.98 ERA at Hart. Matson pitched last at Santa Monica High in 1989. 
The long reliever or set-up man will be right-hander John Bowman (8-4, 2.45 ERA 
at Sylmar) and the closers will be left-hander Tom Manning (9-2, 1.47 at 
Kennedy) and right-hander Brad Coukos (5-5, 2.77 at Canyon). They will work 
with two catchers, returnee Jim Traylor and transfer David Castillo. Last 
year's starting catcher, Chris Pfatenhauer, will move to shortstop. Traylor had 
only two at-bats for the Cougars last season and Castillo, who Mohney said 
probably will be the starter, played at Pasadena City in 1993. Pfatenhauer 
(.277, 19 RBIs) will be joined in the infield by returnees Tom Nickels at 
first, Ari Jacobs at second and all-state second-team pick Ted Kiester at 
third. Jacobs batted .298 last season and Kiester was fourth in the WSC in 
batting at .414. Nickels will replace Andy Shaw (now at Cal State Northridge), 
who won the WSC triple crown last season with a .405 batting average, 12 home 
runs and 51 RBIs. The outfield will be anchored by sophomore center fielder 
John Davis (.308, three home runs, 24 RBIs) when he recovers from surgery for a 
cut nerve on the index finger of his left hand. Davis suffered the injury 
during the Jan. 17 earthquake. Sophomore J.T. Billingslea will be in right 
field, with sophomore R.J. Fenolio in left. The designated hitter duties will 
be handled by one of two newcomers, Dave Supple (six home runs, 25 RBIs at 
Notre Dame High last year) or Brian Powers (.494, two home runs, 32 RBIs at 
Chaminade). 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK: All those freshmen pitchers are making Mohney feel a bit uneasy. "We 
are scared," he said. "We are counting on them to mature real fast. But the 
real question might be our offense. We are concerned we are not going to score 
a lot of runs." Mohney is hoping the Cougars can pick up the slack in the 
field. "I think we'll wind up being a pretty consistent team on defense, which 
we were not last season," he said. GLENDALE 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Steve Coots, 17th season 
</P>
<P>
 LAST SEASON: 18-20; tied for eighth in WSC, 13-17 
</P>
<P>
 PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Vaqueros will do battle with a squad loaded with 
freshmen and only two returning starters -- outfielder Lance Evans and pitcher 
John Nall. Evans, a unanimous All-WSC first-team selection last season after 
batting .344 with 32 RBIs and eight home runs, moves to left field from 
designated hitter and catcher. Nall, a 6-foot-5 left-handed starter, is coming 
off a 5-4 season with a 5.69 ERA. He figures to share the pitching load with 
left-hander Josh Parker, 0-1 with a 6.45 ERA in 22 1/3 innings last year. 
Freshman right-hander Rick Luna (4-6, 5.77 ERA at St. Francis High) figures to 
see action in relief. Evans, freshman catcher Andy Reitz and freshman third 
baseman Chris Padron, both from Bishop Amat High, and freshman right fielder 
Bryan Warner from Monrovia High also will see mound duty. Another Bishop Amat 
graduate, freshman Nathan Baez, will compete with sophomore Rob Turner at first 
base. Catcher Pat Lodes and 6-4 shortstop Randy Vickers, freshmen from South 
Hills in West Covina, also are expected to contribute. Jack Wickersham, a 
freshman from La Canada High, will patrol center field, and Ed Gillis, a 
transfer from Santa Monica College, will play second base. Padron, Warner, 
Vickers and Wickersham played on the San Gabriel Valley all-star team that won 
the Babe Ruth senior World Series in August. That team was coached by former 
Dodger outfielder Mike Marshall, a Glendale assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK: The Vaqueros lack experience, which Coots said is the team's biggest 
drawback. "I think we'll play good defense and we'll hit a little," said Coots, 
whose teams have won 302 games. MISSION 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: John Klitsner, sixth season 
</P>
<P>
 LAST SEASON: 25-15; second in So. California Athletic Conference, 14-6 
</P>
<P>
 PLAYERS TO WATCH: Two talented transfers and some key returnees lend 
much-needed experience to a team laden with freshmen. Among the players 
Klitsner will rely on for offense are shortstop Erik Lazerus, who batted .667 
in six games for Cal State Northridge last season, and third baseman Dave 
Valdez (.307 with 14 RBIs at UC San Diego in 1992). "(Lazerus) should be one of 
the best (junior college) infielders in the state and (Valdez) has been our 
most consistent player throughout the fall. He has a lot of offensive skills," 
said Klitsner, who is also counting on sophomore outfielders Jesus Perez, Gary 
Matthews and Dereck Ornelas. Perez batted .382 and drove in 16 runs last 
season. Matthews, who was drafted in the 13th round last June by the San Diego 
Padres, is back after batting .320 with two home runs and 22 RBIs. Ornelas was 
sidelined because of a shoulder injury and redshirted last season. Klitsner 
also figures that freshman second baseman John Toven, who batted .390 with 18 
RBIs at Kennedy High last season, will contribute. Sophomore starting catcher 
Joey Gandara (.258, 16 RBIs) joins pitchers Rob Walley and Eric Diaz on the 
list of returnees. Walley, a left-hander, was 1-1 with a 6.82 ERA last season 
and Diaz, a right-hander, was 3-1 with a 7.92 ERA. They will lead a pitching 
corps that will feature newcomers John Romero and Raymond Rivera (San Fernando 
High), Robert Ballester (Monroe High), Freddy Esqueda (Poly High) and Justin 
Sampley (Montclair Prep), but that will have to make do without last year's ace 
Josh Brown (11-3, 3.11 ERA), now at Southern Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK: This season could mirror 1993 for the Free Spirit: There's plenty of 
hitting but the pitching is suspect. "I think we should hit. I think we have 
to," Klitsner said. "The guys who have the potential to hit are going to have 
to get it done. Our guys are going to have to play good defense because we 
don't have the overpowering pitching." Mission finished one game behind East 
L.A. in the conference race last season, and Klitsner hopes a solid effort can 
put the Free Spirit in the thick of things again. MOORPARK 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Ken Wagner, fifth season 
</P>
<P>
 LAST SEASON: 20-21; seventh in WSC, 14-16 
</P>
<P>
 PLAYERS TO WATCH: Five players from last season's powerful Simi Valley High 
team will be in the Raider lineup. Designated hitter Britten Pond and catcher 
Kevin Nykoluk will give considerable sock to the Moorpark offense. Pond batted 
.532 with six home runs and 47 RBIs last season, and also hit 15 doubles and 
four triples. Nykoluk batted .467 with 10 home runs and 50 RBIs. Their high 
school teammates, shortstop Ryan Briggs (.347, 20 RBIs), and outfielders Aaron 
Whitley (.362, 18 RBIs, 21 stolen bases) and Jason Alcala (.259, 16 RBIs) will 
join four returnees who should give the Raiders a formidable offense. "The kids 
we got from Simi Valley have done well (in fall competition)," Wagner said. 
Among the sophomores Wagner will try to blend with the new crop are first 
baseman Aaron Fischer (.288, three home runs, 25 RBIs), second baseman Sean 
Mitchell (.324), third baseman Ken Cote (.409) and center fielder Wayne 
Northern (.370, 12 stolen bases). Sophomore Tom Anderson will be in right 
field. The pitching staff will include sophomore right-handers Jeff Naster, who 
redshirted last season, and Brad Taylor. Freshmen right-hander Keith Loitz 
(5-5, 1.90 ERA at Royal High in 1993) and left-hander Dale Robinson, who played 
high school baseball in Utah, add pitching depth. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK: If any team should benefit from the new two-division format in the 
WSC, the Raiders are it. Moorpark shows great hitting potential and, Wagner 
said, a steady defense that should help them challenge for the North Division 
championship. "I think we'll be pretty competitive," Wagner said. "We have a 
real good infield and I like our pitching staff." OXNARD 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Chris Stevens, third season 
</P>
<P>
 LAST SEASON: 12-28; 10th in WSC, 7-23 
</P>
<P>
 PLAYERS TO WATCH: Youth abounds on the Condor roster this season, but maybe 
that's a good sign. Oxnard had 13 sophomores on the squad in 1993 but all that 
experience didn't help much. With the exception of five sophomores, including 
four starting pitchers, the Condors are laden with freshmen. Stevens will rely 
on right-handers Greg Arnold, Joey Vargas and Chad Olthoff, and left-handed 
freshman John Cooper as starting pitchers, with right-handers Alex Zavala and 
Ryan Glass in relief. Arnold was 2-1 with a 7.36 ERA last season. Olthoff 
redshirted and Zavala, who will be used in long relief, was 1-1 with a 
team-leading 3.24 ERA. Glass, a freshman from Thousand Oaks High, will be the 
closer. They will throw to one of two freshmen catchers, Robert Sanchez from 
Camarillo High or Adam Basua from Rio Mesa. Basua redshirted last season after 
he suffered a broken leg during a practice before the 1993 season got under 
way. "I'm still undecided about who is going to start," Stevens said. "Basua 
has the slight edge right now on hitting over Robert." The infield features 
nothing but freshmen and former shortstops in high schools. The keystone 
combination will be formed by second baseman Jason Young (25 runs at University 
High in Irvine last season) and shortstop Jess Olivares (.356 with 16 RBIs at 
Hueneme High in 1993). Armando Marcial, from Santa Clara High, will handle 
first base and either Ryan Gause (Temecula Valley High) or Josh Silverstein 
(Thousand Oaks) will play third. Four freshmen will be in the outfield -- 
right-fielder Joe Torres (Oxnard High), center fielder Andy Wilson (Thousand 
Oaks) and left fielder Adrian Castellon (Channel Islands). Jim Seguine (Buena 
High) will play when Torres pitches in relief. Wilson, who batted .388 with 19 
RBIs and 28 stolen bases last season, will lead off. Young, a four-year starter 
at shortstop in high school, will bat second. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK: Even with an inexperienced club, Stevens is anxious to get the season 
rolling. "This is the first time in the last two years where I've felt we are 
ready to (play) right now," he said. "This is probably the most intelligent 
team I've ever had. They have adapted real well." PIERCE 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Bob Lofrano, fourth season 
</P>
<P>
 LAST SEASON: 23-17; tied for second in WSC, 19-11 
</P>
<P>
 PLAYERS TO WATCH: With six newcomers in the Brahmas' eight-man starting 
lineup, Lofrano is looking to his experienced pitching corps for leadership. 
The ace of the staff will be returning left-hander Adam West (3-4, 7.06 ERA in 
1993), who Lofrano said had an excellent fall. The other likely starters will 
be returnees Brandon Nickens, a right-hander who was 0-2 with a 7.55 ERA last 
season, and Tony Dellamano (3-1, 5.63 ERA). Newcomer Jason Warren, a 
right-hander who was 2-9 with a 4.96 ERA at Agoura High last year, also will be 
in the running for a starting spot. The stopper again will be right-hander 
Chris Frith-Smith (4-3 and a team-best 3.41 ERA), who tied with Ventura's Marco 
Grajales for the WSC lead in saves with seven. Around the horn, the Brahmas 
will go with sophomore Kevin Milligan (.325 with two home runs and 32 RBIs last 
season, mostly as the designated hitter) at first base, freshman Cesar Martinez 
(.375 and 22 stolen bases at Notre Dame High in 1993) at second base, former 
Thousand Oaks High standout Brian Sturges, who played sparingly at Cal State 
Sacramento last year, at shortstop, and Louis Tapia, the only returnee on the 
infield, at third base. Tapia led the Brahmas in hitting last year at .391 and 
knocked in 36 runs. The outfield will be occupied by Heath McElwee (.370 in 20 
games at Canyons last season) in left field, returnee Brian Basowski (.280 with 
three home runs and 17 RBIs) in center and returnee Robert Vazquez (.275 with 
15 RBIs) in right. Basowski was a backup outfielder last year. Crespi High 
graduate Brett Farlow, a transfer from Long Beach State, will do the catching 
and John Novak, who batted .297 with 22 RBIs at El Camino Real High last 
season, will be the designated hitter. Edgar Maldonado (who batted .324 in 
limited play) returns as a utility player. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK: The Brahmas had plenty of firepower last season and shaky pitching 
but the roles might be reversed this time. "I'm more encouraged by our starting 
pitching," Lofrano said. "I've been really pleased with their work (in the 
fall). But I think our offense will produce." Lofrano said he will stick with 
mainly eight or 10 regular players. VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Chris Johnson, seventh season 
</P>
<P>
 LAST SEASON: 20-16; tied for second in WSC, 19-11 
</P>
<P>
 PLAYERS TO WATCH: Although the Monarchs appear strong in all facets of the 
game, hitting probably will be their calling card. The top gun in Valley's 
arsenal is first baseman David Stevenson, who last season took the team triple 
crown with a .407 batting average, five home runs and 34 RBIs. Stevenson, who 
has signed to play next season for former Valley Coach Dave Snow at Long Beach 
State, also had team-high numbers in hits (55) and stolen bases (17). He will 
have plenty of help from Ozzie Areu (.350, 17 RBI)s, who moves to center field 
from right field. Another returnee, Jamie Zeichick (.256, three home runs, 26 
RBIs), will be in right field. Three players -- Carl Grissom, power-hitting 
Marlon Hamilton and Will Skett -- will battle for left field. Grissom hit .196 
at Pierce last season, Hamilton played at El Camino College in 1992 but sat out 
last season, and Skett is a redshirt freshman who is also in the running for 
the starting job at second base. Johnson said Eric Morante, who redshirted two 
years ago and was cut last season, might have a slight advantage over sophomore 
Ted Gonzalez at shortstop. Third base again will be patrolled by Vic Seper 
(.267 and 30 RBIs) and returnee Doug Rubin (.160 in only 25 at-bats), the 
backup catcher last season, takes over behind the plate. One newcomer who 
Johnson said "will definitely be involved" is former Monroe High pitching ace 
Jorge Dorado (8-0, 2.20 ERA last season). The right-hander, who batted .486 
with 18 RBIs in 1993, has been bothered by tendinitis in his pitching arm and 
will play strictly middle infield. His brother, Juan, will be one of the 
relievers on a talented pitching staff. The mainstays will be returning 
right-hander Juan Velazquez (2-3, 5.65 ERA), who Johnson said has "developed 
big time over the fall," and right-hander Shaik Nabi, a transfer from College 
of the Redwoods. Probable spot starters will be left-hander returnee Jason Litt 
(1-0, 4.97 ERA) and freshmen right-handers Kevin Szymanski (10-1, 1.26 ERA at 
El Camino Real High last season) and Francisco Mere, who pitched at Monroe in 
the mid-1980s. Sophomore left-hander Ryan Messervier (3.09 ERA, two saves) will 
be the closer. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK: Because of the way his team is rounding into form, Johnson is looking 
to challenge seriously for the WSC South Division title. "We just don't have 
too many holes," he said. "We have some depth in the pitching staff. 
Theoretically, we should be very good offensively. Now I look down to the 
on-deck circle through nine (players) and I feel really good." VENTURA 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Gary Anglin, 17th season 
</P>
<P>
 LAST SEASON: 18-20; tied for eighth in WSC, 13-17 
</P>
<P>
 PLAYERS TO WATCH: Perhaps scared by Ventura's poor pitching last season (5.39 
ERA), Anglin will open the season with only two starters, right-hander Marco 
Grajales and left-hander Eric Rafter. The two sophomores head an inexperienced 
staff. Grajales (0-1 last season) led the Pirates with a 2.40 ERA and set a 
school single-season record with seven saves. Rafter was 3-4 with 5.07 ERA. 
Left-hander Bryant Fick (0-2, 7.56 ERA) and right-hander Jeff Hook (0-1, 36.00 
ERA) also return. Also expected to pitch will be freshmen right-handers Brandon 
Knight, who was 6-2 with a 2.05 ERA at Buena High last season, and Tim Farris, 
who was 2-3 with a 4.20 ERA at Newbury Park High. However, the 
left-handed-hitting Knight (.429, two home runs, 16 RBIs) will play primarily 
in right field, and Farris (.346, two home runs, 18 RBIs) will back up Clint 
Harris at first base. Harris batted .528 with three home runs and 27 RBIs at 
Thousand Oaks High last season. One infield spot the Pirates will have well 
guarded this season will be second base, where David Frazier returns after 
being academically ineligible last season. Frazier batted .403 and was an 
All-WSC selection in 1992. Jorge Macias, who batted .339 in conference play 
last year, is back at shortstop, and freshman Sam Monroy takes over at third 
base. Monroy batted .394, knocked in 13 runs and stole 24 bases in 25 attempts 
at Channel Islands High in 1993. With Monroy and freshman center fielder Jamal 
Nichols, who stole 37 bases at Thousand Oaks last season, the Pirates could 
give headaches to opposing catchers. Nichols (.454, five home runs, 18 RBIs) 
also should provide some punch. Returnee Chris Mace (.317, 30 RBIs) will be in 
left field. Shoulder surgery kept redshirt freshman catcher Robert Fick out of 
action last season, but the former Newbury Park standout (.315 his senior 
season) has recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK: As in 1993, Anglin is concerned about one team component -- pitching. 
"Like most junior colleges, our pitching will be a question mark," he said. But 
Anglin hopes his team's defense and hitting will override the potential 
pitching deficiencies. "Through the fall, we fielded over .950. I think we'll 
hit well and play good defense," Anglin said.

OLSON CLOSES THE DOOR ON ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Free-agent reliever Gregg Olson, who the Angels had hoped would be their 
closer the next four seasons, has decided to sign elsewhere, according to 
sources familiar with the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're moving toward a deal," agent Jeff Moorad said."But I'm still not sure 
where the deal will end up, or with what team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our talks with the Angels progress nicely, but Gregg and I felt it was 
appropriate to explore other opportunities. The Angels were very sincere and 
professional in their negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 Olson, who has saved at least 27 games in each of the last five seasons with 
the Baltimore Orioles, is expected to sign with the Toronto Blue Jays, or 
possibly the New York Yankees by this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are expected to use a bullpen-by-committee this season, led by Mike 
Butcher, who saved eight games last season. 
</P>
<P>
 In other news, the Angels signed starter John Dopson to a triple-A contract 
and will invite him to spring training. Dopson, who was 7-11 with a 4.97 ERA 
last season with the Boston Red Sox, will join Russ Springer, Hilly Hathaway 
and John Farrell as candidates for the fifth starter's spot. He has a 29-43 
career record with a 4.10 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels also signed left-hander Mark Holzemer to a contract Wednesday that 
will pay him $112,500 if he makes the major league team. Holzemer was 9-6 with 
a 4.82 ERA in 24 games (23 starts) with triple-A Vancouver last season before 
being recalled Aug. 20 to the Angels. BOB NIGHTENGALE

<P>
 The Rams have granted offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese permission to begin 
negotiations with the Dallas Cowboys to fill the spot vacated by Norv Turner, 
who was named head coach of the Washington Redskins Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Zampese is expected to meet with Cowboy Coach Jimmy Johnson next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams were not obligated to free Zampese, who has a year remaining on his 
contract. But in answer to Zampese's concern about the team's possible move 
from Anaheim, Ram Coach Chuck Knox gave him permission to discuss the Cowboy 
vacancy. T.J. SIMERS

 Ram receivers coach Milt Jackson has signed a three-year contract to be the 
receivers coach for the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, whose contract with the Rams expires this month, becomes the sixth 
assistant coach to join new Coach June Jones' staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson becomes the second member of Ram Coach Chuck Knox's staff to leave. 
Quarterbacks coach Ted Tollner left after the season to become San Diego 
State's head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The move reunites Jackson and Jones, who were assistant coaches on Jerry 
Glanville's staff in Houston for two seasons in the late 1980s. Jackson also 
was the receivers' coach at Indianapolis in 1989, when Atlanta wide receiver 
Andre Rison was in his rookie season with the Colts. MIKE REILLEY

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: FOR RUSSIAN CRUISE LINE OPERATORS, THEIR SHIP IS COMING 
IN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MOSCOW ON THE HARBOR: Russia isn't exactly the first country that comes to 
mind when you think of luxury cruise ships -- or even the second, or the third, 
or the 20th. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, as Russian emigre comedian Yakov Smirnoff says: "In Russia they don't 
have the Love Boat; they have the Love Barge." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Russian cruise ships are becoming an increasingly common sight 
in the Port of Los Angeles. This week, the 650-passenger Maxim Gorkiy berthed 
here for the second time in two years, steaming in from Mexico and spending 
about a day before heading to San Francisco. Last year, the inelegantly named 
Kazakhstan cruise ship also made Los Angeles one of its ports of call. And in 
March, the Russian cruise ship Odessa will stop by. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Russians are coming, the Russians are coming!" joked Port of Los Angeles 
marketing manager Karen Tozer. "We don't see a lot of Russian cruise ships, but 
they do come in occasionally. They're really very nice ships." 
</P>
<P>
 So who takes a cruise in a Russian cruise ship? Well, it's not Russians. Tozer 
said almost all of the passengers aboard the Maxim Gorkiy were Germans. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 SMOOTH TRANSITION: A month ago, it looked as if Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del 
Rey) would lose a connection to the Pentagon's top chief with the departure of 
Defense Secretary Les Aspin. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspin -- a friend since her days in the Carter Administration -- helped Harman 
get on powerful House committees. And their friendship didn't suffer when she 
and other lawmakers successfully lobbied to keep the Los Angeles Air Force Base 
in El Segundo open. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman, however, didn't have the same ties to Bobby Ray Inman, President 
Clinton's first choice for Pentagon chief. And one opponent in this year's 
election predicted she would "lose her sympathetic ear." 
</P>
<P>
 But with Clinton's latest nomination, Deputy Defense Secretary William Perry, 
Harman once again may have a friend in the top spot. She knew Perry also from 
the Carter Administration.  
</P>
<P>
 "He is an excellent choice," she said. "He's very good for the South Bay and 
very good for this Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, he has set foot in the neighborhood. In June, he went to a 
Hughes Aircraft Co. plant in El Segundo to survey some company projects. 
</P>

<P>
 HORSE POWER: Rancho Palos Verdes needs more money to maintain its 
long-cherished equestrian trails and to keep tabs on horse vaccinations. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution, city officials said, would be $50 horse licenses -- a proposal 
bound to rile horse enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble is, that's only enough to cover the cost of handing out the licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the question of who gets charged: the horse owner, the stable 
owner or the rider. (The horse, it can be assumed, won't pay). 
</P>
<P>
 Those wary of the proposal argue that it's the horses that are getting singled 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "What about hikers and others who use the trails?" said Hirsh Marantz, vice 
president of the Palos Verdes Peninsula Horsemen's Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 So it's back to the drawing boards.

 COFFER CRUNCH: With a little more than a month to go until the election, 
Torrance's mayoral candidates have amassed sizable war chests in the race to 
succeed Katy Geissert. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bill Applegate had $52,678 in cash as of Jan. 22, and Councilwoman 
Dee Hardison had $27,250. Applegate has spent $22,621 so far, and Hardison has 
shelled out $13,558. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for City Council, urban planner Jack Messerlian has $10,198, the 
most of any of the 11 candidates running. Retired accountant Marcia Cribbs 
leads spending with $10,111. 
</P>
<P>
 All that may seem like a lot of money. But Hardison says she and other 
candidates in the race for City Council are finding it tougher raising cash 
than in previous elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sign of the times," Hardison said. "There's less money out there, so 
everyone is pretty much drawing from the same sources." Even the big spender in 
1992's council campaign, El Camino college professor Burton Fletcher, appears 
to have slowed down. He shelled out $61,000 in '92. He has a way to go to match 
that. He's spent only $2,574.55. QUOTE OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 "If I need to do something, it gets done before it gets dark. I'm telling you, 
this madness has got to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sally Ann Hoofe of Inglewood, on how gang violence, which killed five 
people and injured six in two days last week, has changed the way she lives.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; CITY TO GET $13.6 MILLION IN PORT SURPLUS FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long Beach Harbor commissioners recently agreed to transfer $13.6 million in 
surplus money to the city's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Port Finance Director Michael Slavin said the transfer would not have a major 
impact on the port's $455-million annual budget. Under the arrangement, the 
first half of the sum was transferred Jan. 24. The city will receive the 
remainder in June. 
</P>
<P>
 A bill passed by the Legislature in 1992 allows port cities to tap into port 
revenues to offset the loss of property tax funds from the state.

 The City Council voted this week to rearrange the dates of local elections, 
paving the way for some members to remain in office nearly an extra year. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted to move local spring elections from even years to odd years 
to avoid a conflict with the California presidential primary, which has been 
shifted from June to March by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The April, 1996, city election will be moved to March, 1997, which means the 
terms of council members Esther Corona Caldwell and Gerald A. Mulrooney will be 
extended another 11 months. And whoever wins the three seats in this April's 
election will serve until 1999 instead of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes were approved by a 4-0 vote. Councilwoman Elvira Oropeza was 
absent. JOHN POPE

CITY HALL JOURNAL: PICO RIVERA; LARGE HOUSING PROJECT RECEIVES CITY APPROVAL

<P>
 The City Council has approved a controversial housing project on 12.6 acres at 
the intersection of Washington and Rosemead boulevards, ending three years of 
wrangling. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics said the project, which will include 116 single-family houses and 150 
apartments, is too big for the site and will create traffic problems. The 
development is across the street from Northrop Corp. Other residents questioned 
the decision to include a mixture of low- and moderate-income residences with 
more expensive homes. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, however, said the project means an improvement, replacing 
aging buildings with new homes. Construction is expected to begin by early next 
year and the residences should be finished within three years. ANN GRIFFITH

SOUTH BAY NEWS; SVORINICH GRAPPLES WITH EXODUS OF STAFF MEMBERS; GOVERNMENT: 
FORMER AIDES AIR CRITICISM OF FRESHMAN COUNCILMAN. BUT HE DISMISSES BARBS AS 
ACTS OF REPRISAL. 
</P>

<P>
 Barely seven months after winning election, Los Angeles City Councilman Rudy 
Svorinich Jr. finds his office in upheaval with the departure of six aides, 
including his chief deputy and longtime friend, John Vidovich. 
</P>
<P>
 While the long-term impact of the firings and resignations is uncertain, what 
is clear is that the paint-store-owner-turned-politician must spend the coming 
weeks repairing an office that has seen the biggest City Hall exodus in recent 
years. And that alone could make his next few months as bumpy as the last ones, 
especially with once-loyal former aides now airing sharp criticism of their 
former boss, whose district stretches from Watts to San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very betrayed," said Brian Hannon, who had been Svorinich's field 
deputy in Harbor City and Harbor Gateway. "I truly believed in him, believed he 
was the common man -- the man with grass-roots support -- who could make a 
difference at City Hall." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Hannon said: "I don't know what to believe. I have lost all respect for 
him. I have lost all trust in him." 
</P>
<P>
 Said another former aide, John Barbieri: "We have all reached the same 
conclusion that Rudy has a problem: He is simply unable to tell the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview this week, Svorinich dismissed the criticism as predictable 
reactions to his decision to overhaul the office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't you think if you were the person who was asked to leave that you would 
be very ashamed that your employer no longer had confidence in you (and) that 
you were going to rationalize any way you could that you . . . are not the bad 
guy?" Svorinich said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also sought to discount any long-term consequences to his office stemming 
from the departures. 
</P>
<P>
 "When all else is said and done, I have to do what is best for people of the 
15th Council District. That's my job. And I will continue to do that," he said, 
predicting the staff positions -- almost half his office -- would be filled 
within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The turmoil began Jan. 20 when Vidovich resigned with a biting four-page memo 
to Svorinich. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rudy, we have been friends for a long time, and I feel that this position I'm 
in is on the verge of seriously damaging a 20-year friendship," wrote Vidovich, 
an L.A. city fire captain who took a leave from that job to join Svorinich's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Vidovich, 33, intended to work in the office up to two years. But his memo 
portrays his tenure with Svorinich as an exasperating experience. Among other 
things, the memo claims, Svorinich often ignored his staff, was indecisive on 
important issues and had alienated both staff and other council members with 
his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rudy, you have to get your act together. You have to stop canceling meetings, 
stop lying to your staff, and spend more time developing relationships with 
your colleagues," Vidovich wrote. "Basically, you have to mature and grow up." 
</P>
<P>
 Hannon, 29, who left teaching to become a field deputy, said he decided to 
leave after a frustrating two-hour meeting with Svorinich the same day Vidovich 
resigned. During that meeting, Hannon said, he confronted Svorinich over the 
councilman's refusal to follow recommendations of his staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbieri, an aide to former Rep. Glenn Anderson (D-Long Beach) and a 
congressional candidate himself, charged that Svorinich had undermined his 
staff and its ability to serve the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your compulsive lying, lack of personal integrity and outright bumbling of 
your official duties does great harm to the community that has placed its trust 
in you, and diminishes the value of the office you hold," Barbieri wrote in a 
resignation memo submitted after a meeting with Svorinich. 
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich insisted that such criticism was news to him -- proving, he said, 
the attacks were motivated by reprisal. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my first seven months in office, I never had a harsh word, a reprimand or 
any significant disagreement with any member of my staff. Ever. Nor did a staff 
member, until the resignation of John Vidovich . . . ever come up to me and 
say, 'I have a problem with you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, there was additional criticism involving Svorinich's office that 
is unlikely to disappear in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 Several former aides, for example, have alleged that political contributions 
were accepted by staff at a San Pedro field office -- a practice that violates 
the city's ethics laws. 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance, the date of which is unclear, an envelope containing 
contribution checks to Svorinich were delivered to the office and taken by a 
council aide who later reported the incident to the city's Ethics Commission. 
And though Svorinich said the matter was closed, an Ethics Commission official, 
as is common practice, refused to confirm or deny whether an inquiry is under 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, as Svorinich confidently announced his search for new staff, some 
former aides predicted his quest would all but cripple his political agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the whole district is going to suffer," Hannon said, "(because) Rudy 
is going to become so consumed with dealing with this one problem -- all the 
resignations -- that he is not going to be able to do anything else in the 
district . . . He won't be able to do his job effectively."

SOUTH BAY NEWS; INGLEWOOD POSTS REWARD IN KILLING SPREE BY GANGS; CRIME: 
$25,000 IS OFFERED FOR THE ARREST -- NOT NECESSARILY CONVICTION -- OF A 
SUSPECT. RANDOM VIOLENCE HAS CAUSED SOME RESIDENTS TO CHANGE THE WAY THEY LIVE.

<P>
 While anguished parents mourned their dead children and fearful Inglewood 
residents altered their daily routines to avoid violence, the Inglewood City 
Council posted a $25,000 reward for the killers responsible for two nights of 
unprecedented gang violence last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven people were gunned down and five of them, including a 2-year-old girl 
and a 14-year-old cheerleader, were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Inglewood police announced that a 16-year-old Los Angeles youth was 
arrested Monday and was expected to be charged with murder in the death of the 
cheerleader, Tila Lashay French. Police said they withheld announcing the 
arrest until Wednesday to avoid tipping off other suspects who are still wanted 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood Police Sgt. Alex Perez offered few details concerning the arrest, 
except to say that leads were developed through citizen tips. At least two 
other suspects in the French shooting were still being sought, Perez said. He 
said he did not know whether the youth is also suspected in the other slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 After protests from residents at the council meeting that a proposed $10,000 
reward was not enough either to lure someone to turn in a suspect or to show 
the city's anger, the council increased the reward. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about five lives, and ($10,000) is not enough," said Beverly 
Burris, who knew three of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Burris showed the council and a standing-room-only crowd of about 150 a photo 
of victim Garland E. Money, a family friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here to humanize him for you," Burris said. "He was a good boy." 
</P>
<P>
 The council made the award payable for an arrest, not necessarily a 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we've seen with even the Menendez case, a conviction isn't guaranteed even 
when the people confess to doing it," said Councilman Garland Hardeman, 
referring to hung juries in the trials of Erik and Lyle Menendez, who killed 
their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood city officials have been notified that the Los Angeles County Board 
of Supervisors intends to offer an additional $5,000 for information leading to 
convictions in the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 In last week's rampage, all the dead and four of the wounded were hit in what 
police believe were gang-related shootings. Two other people were wounded 
during apparent attempted robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on witness descriptions, police believe some assailants might have been 
involved in several of the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 The first to be killed was Kyiara Nicole Morrow-Jackson, 2, who was shot while 
her mother, Gina Morrow, 23, was standing in front of their home on West 78th 
Street, talking to a male friend shortly before 7 p.m. Jan. 26. Three men in a 
brown or gray Cadillac drove up and, according to police, might have thought 
Morrow's friend was a rival gang member because he was wearing a red shirt. 
They got out of the car and opened fire with 9-millimeter semiautomatic 
pistols, wounding Morrow in the thigh and hitting her daughter in the chest. 
The young girl died later at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 French was the second victim. She was shot about 7:30 p.m. while she stood 
with a group of friends in the 800 block of North Eucalyptus Avenue. The 
Inglewood teen-ager was a freshman at Hawthorne High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was so funny and lively and outgoing," said French's longtime friend Kona 
Tamba. "I can't picture her dead. Just the other day I was talking to her and 
laughing with her." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The next victims were three 21-year-old men sitting in a parked car on North 
Market Street shortly before 8:30 p.m. Thursday. Two or three men armed with 
assault rifles got out of a dark-colored small car, possibly a Honda or 
Hyundai, and riddled the men's car with dozens of bullets. Garland E. Money, 
Sean Omar Williams and Kenneth Darryl Cannon were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence has changed many Inglewood residents' lives. All those 
interviewed at random on city streets say their fear level has increased. Some 
take different routes to work to avoid dangerous areas. Most say they don't 
venture out at night unless they have to -- and some won't leave their homes 
after dark for any reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Runnels, 32, a barber who has lived in Inglewood for about 20 years, 
said the gang violence has altered his daily movements -- and his wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worry about what to wear every morning," Runnels said. An African American 
male, he never wears red or blue clothing, lest gang members mistake him for a 
member of a rival gang identified by those colors.  
</P>
<P>
 "I used to walk home from work at night, but now I get a ride. It's only four 
or five blocks, but it's a dangerous walk. I never used to be nervous about 
walking home before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Sally Ann Hoofe, an Inglewood resident for five years, the fear began in a 
hail of bullets two months ago as she walked to the laundry. Three men in a car 
began shooting at a man running on the sidewalk. "I ran and threw myself down 
behind a car. I almost had a heart attack and I'm still not over it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoofe doesn't go out in the evening anymore. "If I need to do something, it 
gets done before it gets dark. I'm telling you, this madness has got to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood police believe the violence was part of an ongoing war between 
Inglewood gangs and members of a rival gang in the Crenshaw district of Los 
Angeles. The killings in Inglewood might have been prompted by earlier killings 
outside the city by Inglewood gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Police stress that in almost all the cases, the Inglewood victims were not 
gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang members "seem to be satisfied if they shoot anybody in the enemy's 
territory," Sgt. Perez said. "It's just random. We aren't dealing with brain 
surgeons here."  
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood Police Chief Oliver M. Thompson said last week that it would be 
"appropriate" for Inglewood residents to remain at home after dark to avoid 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite last week's blood bath, Inglewood police said gang-related crime in 
this city of 112,000 has declined 27% in the past two years. Police released 
crime statistics indicating gang-related homicides dropped 19%, from 31 in 1992 
to 25 in 1993. Gang-related assaults also declined 19%, from 339 to 275.  
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the statistics showed that shooting at an inhabited 
dwelling increased 38%, from 37 incidents in 1992 to 51 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said there have been similar decreases in gang-related violence 
throughout the county. Several well-publicized gang truces might have been a 
factor, he said.

DOWNEY WILL GIVE BUS LINE A TRIAL RUN; TRANSIT: COUNCIL VOTES TO SPEND $458,000 
FOR INTRA-CITY MINIVAN SERVICE DESPITE FORECASTS THAT THE PILOT PROGRAM WILL 
NOT BE FULLY UTILIZED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An experimental intra-city bus line will begin in Downey this spring despite a 
recent report that said few residents use public transportation already 
available.  
</P>
<P>
 City Council members recently allocated $458,000 in state transportation funds 
to pay for the pilot program, a four-route system that will use minivans to 
haul riders within the 12.7-square-mile city. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's newest bus line will be evaluated after a year, said James Jarrett, 
director of community services. The city signed a one-year contract with 
Mayflower Contract Services Inc., which will provide the vehicles and the 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just glad that we are finally going to try (the buses)," Jarrett said. 
"We'll wait to see if (the new line) gets used or not, then make a decision on 
its future." 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation consultants hired by the city last year found that just 12% of 
Downey's 91,444 residents use public transportation such as Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority buses, Dial-A-Ride services for senior citizens and 
special services for youth and handicapped riders. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultants estimated that the new line would probably attract an average 
of 14 to 19 riders per hour, or fewer than five riders per vehicle. The 
minivans can carry up to 20 passengers.  
</P>
<P>
 "The (ridership) predictions look questionable," Councilwoman Barbara J. Riley 
said. "I don't want to spend a fortune on a system that is not going to be 
used. I'd rather give out vouchers for taxis -- it's much cheaper."  
</P>
<P>
 Still, Riley and three others on the council said they were willing to give 
the bus system a trial run. Despite the dismal ridership figures, Riley said 
she thinks there is a need for low-cost transportation within the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The MTA runs in and out of the city, but you can't really get around unless 
you have a car," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gary P. McCaughan voted against the new bus line, preferring 
instead to sell the transportation funds to another city, which would yield 
about 50 cents on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying that public transit isn't important," McCaughan said. "But it 
is something we can wait on. I think we could have used the money to get us 
through these lean times." 
</P>
<P>
 The money comes from Proposition A, the half-cent sales tax initiative that 
voters approved in the early 1980s. Since 1982, Downey has received about $1 
million each year for transportation, paying for Dial-A-Ride and other 
transportation-related services.  
</P>
<P>
 The proposed bus service drew mixed responses from Downey residents in a 
survey last year by two transportation consultants, Santa Ana-based DAVE 
Transportation Services Inc. and Claremont-based A-M-M-A. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most respondents said they would welcome the bus, others said that by 
providing low-cost transportation, the city would attract more 
"non-English-speaking" residents and those who are "unemployed and homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 Others said they feared that the new bus line would bring higher taxes. Some 
said the city isn't big enough to have its own bus line. "Downey is so small," 
wrote one resident, "we can walk to almost anywhere we need to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they hope some Downey residents who also work in the city will 
use the new bus service. About 25% of the Downey work force lives in the city, 
according to the 1990 census.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials are also counting on members of one-car families, who make up more 
than half the city's residents, to use the minivans for shopping and other 
errands. The final destination point for each of the bus routes is the 
Stonewood Shopping Center  
</P>
<P>
 The vans will run Monday through Friday from 6:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. beginning 
April 1. The fare will be 25 cents per ride.

LOCAL ECONOMY GETS HEFTY CUT FROM HAIR SHOW 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sitting on the arm of a raggedy couch backstage at the Terrace Theater, 
Stephen Moody watches four women in light mesh tops and filmy shorts dance to 
synthesized music.  
</P>
<P>
 The choreography is incidental. Moody is concentrating on the models' 
close-cropped hair, glimmering in a rainbow of blond shades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Short, textured hair with quite a lot of height in the center, along the top, 
that's what's new," said Moody, principal of Vidal Sassoon's internationally 
known hair academy in Los Angeles. "And blond is big, very big." 
</P>
<P>
 Moody nodded. The models were ready to hit the theater's stage in the Long 
Beach Convention Center, where hundreds of hairdressers were waiting for just 
such trend-setting pronouncements from Sassoon and other national and 
international stylists who trotted out their designs. 
</P>
<P>
 The models danced. The company's top stylists also demonstrated new cuts on 
other models. Instamatic cameras flashed throughout the audience to record the 
latest trends. And then, armed with The Word (blond is big, short is hot), the 
hairdressers would return home. 
</P>
<P>
 This three-day Long Beach Beauty and Trade Show has an impact on fashion as 
well as the local economy, promoters and city officials say. Yet it came and 
went last weekend with hardly a ripple in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 52,000 stylists, salespeople and models arrived from throughout the 
country and abroad, and dropped about $33.8 million into the local economy by 
the time the show ended Monday, according to promoters.  
</P>
<P>
 The show's economic impact is second only to the Grand Prix, according to 
figures offered by the Long Beach Area Convention and Visitors Council. The big 
race brings in more than 200,000 visitors a year and adds $40 million to $60 
million to the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the beauty and trade show gathering, which began in 1939 as a competition 
among local hairdressers in the basement of the Masonic Temple on Locust 
Street, may be harder to ignore in the future. The show will be expanded to 
five days instead of three. Although the show isn't open to the general public, 
the crowd is expected to approach 80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers also expect to take advantage of an expanded Convention Center, 
nearly quadrupling exhibition space to 320,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors hope to attract stylists and beauty manufacturers from Japan, South 
Korea, Europe and South America, said William Prather, president of Long Beach 
Hairdressers, which organizes the show. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, the Long Beach event is the only hair show of this 
size. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was an L.A. show like this, but it bombed," said Sassoon's Moody. "It 
was downtown and was just not conducive to young girls walking around looking 
like this." 
</P>
<P>
 He gestured at dozens of young women, staring into mirrors or accepting yet 
another coating of hair spray. These models had quarter-inch yellow buzz cuts, 
fountains of red hair springing into space, or mountains of complicated, 
multicolored curls. 
</P>
<P>
 The haircuts shown on stage are usually not everyday styles. This is the 
avant-garde, the idea factory for your local beautician, who might try to sell 
the short and blond idea, but probably not that red fountain of hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the theater, stylists were buying more modest hairpieces, along with 
bagloads of hair spray, coloring agents and combs. They stopped at various 
booths to see the latest permanent wave techniques and test new nail enamels. 
</P>
<P>
 But they weren't immune to the lure of the avant-garde from the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come on," one woman said, tugging a friend by the elbow. "I heard they have 
dresses made of human hair." They rushed back inside.

 El Rancho Unified School board members will be looking for their fourth school 
superintendent in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members have voted 4-3 not to renew Supt. John T. Sherman's 
contract when it expires in June. Sherman, who has worked in the district 32 
years, has been superintendent for 16 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members Raul Salcido, John Garcia, Rita Jo Ramirez and Eleanor Cole 
voted to replace Sherman, but have refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman, 55, has served as superintendent since September, 1992, when he 
replaced former Supt. Fernando Elizondo, who left the district for unspecified 
personal reasons after 20 months on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The turnover began in 1990 when Supt. Thomas Sakalis retired after eight 
years. The board named Assistant Supt. Arthur Narvaez interim superintendent. 
He headed the district until January, 1991, when Elizondo was hired and given a 
three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 When Elizondo departed unexpectedly, the board turned to Sherman, citing his 
longevity with the 10,700-student district. A graduate of El Rancho High 
School, Sherman held several teaching and administrative posts in the district. 
He was assistant superintendent of operations before being named to the top 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman said he has not decided what he will do when he leaves his 
$92,750-a-year job. He would not comment further on the board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Some community leaders criticized the board's decision, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think John got a raw deal," said Pico Rivera resident Frank Millan, a 
former board member who lost his seat in the school board election last 
November. "As far as I was concerned, he was an outstanding superintendent." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had four (superintendents) leave," said parent Angie Lora, who has 
lived in the district 21 years. "It's very gloomy . . . this turnover we've 
been having lately." 
</P>
<P>
 Others characterized Sherman as a lackluster administrator. "He's just a 
stand-in," parent Darlene Hancox said. "I don't see anything he's 
accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
 Board members Mary Eva Gomez, Frank Boyce and Cecilia Chavez opposed the 
decision to replace Sherman.

SOUTH BAY NEWS; KOREAN WAR MONUMENT CLEARS MAJOR HURDLE; MEMORIAL: SAN PEDRO 
WRAPS UP PAPERWORK AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF DEBATE ON PROJECT HONORING VETERANS. 
PLAN NEEDS APPROVAL OF STATE COASTAL COMMISSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than seven years of sometimes nasty debate, the Korean War Veterans 
Memorial Committee has cleared one of the last remaining hurdles to creating a 
monument in San Pedro to veterans of that war.  
</P>
<P>
 At a recent public hearing, William E. Lillenberg, associate zoning 
administrator for the city, ordered a few minor changes in the city's 
application for the memorial on four acres in Angels Gate Park, and said the 
paperwork is finally ready to submit to the state Coastal Commission for 
approval.  
</P>
<P>
 "The nit-picking is over with," said Rick Seward, past president of the 
memorial committee. "There are men in this room with scars on their hearts and 
scars on their bodies who deserve this memorial." 
</P>
<P>
 The memorial was first approved by the parks commission in 1987, but criticism 
from the community sparked considerable changes to its first configuration, 
which had huge bronze soldiers aiming guns at the enemy. Neighbors said the 
monument was too big and the image too violent. 
</P>
<P>
 They also complained that it was inappropriate to have such a statue near the 
Korean Friendship Bell, a symbol of goodwill given to the city by the people of 
South Korea. And 30-foot-high lighting for statues would be a garish intrusion 
on the ocean vista, area residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to these and other concerns, the monument will comprise life-sized 
statues of men and one woman in the lull of battle and will be placed on a site 
between two World War I batteries near the Ft. McArthur Military Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Parks Department will add ground-level security lighting and consider 
changing the proposed landscaping so ocean views are not blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this is good," said parks spokesman David L. Connetta. "There have 
been many changes to the original design, but we believe the meaning and the 
spirit of the project remains intact. It has become an even better project than 
originally proposed."  
</P>
<P>
 The memorial committee still needs to obtain a city building permit before 
getting the final green light on the project. That approval could come in March 
or April, said John Elliott, the committee's administrative services director. 
After that, another four months are needed to construct the monument, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee had hoped to have the monument dedicated by July 17, 1993, the 
40th anniversary of the war. Now it is shooting for the end of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest leap -- raising $2.5 million for the maintenance of the memorial 
once it is built -- still looms, he said. "But, frankly, that's a lot easier 
when you have a dedication," Elliott said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: HUNTINGTON PARK; EAST L.A. COLLEGE SATELLITE CAMPUS OPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The East Los Angeles College satellite campus will have a grand opening 
ceremony at 11 a.m. Friday at the Pacific Bell building, 2677 Zoe Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus, called the Southeast Annex, will enable area residents to receive 
education and compete in the job market, said Assemblywoman Martha Escutia, 
(D-Huntington Park). 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the Southeast cities have problems, which include overcrowded 
schools, a high level of uneducated residents, high unemployment and increased 
gang activity," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes began at the satellite school on Jan. 18. More than 800 students have 
enrolled, said Silvia Hernandez, administrative assistant to Escutia. She added 
that there is still time to register for classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The new campus, suggested by Mayor Ric Loya five months ago, offers 45 
courses, including classes in accounting, business, child development, health, 
mathematics, real estate, political science and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes cost $13 a credit, and most credits can be transferred to four-year 
state schools.

SOUTH BAY NEWS; UNION SEEKS SCHOOL PERSONNEL PANEL; EDUCATION: PETITION FORCES 
AN ELECTION BY NON-TEACHING EMPLOYEES ON INDEPENDENT COMMISSION TO OVERSEE 
PROMOTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A union for Centinela Valley School District workers has filed a petition to 
force the school board to create a personnel commission that would oversee 
promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapter 47 of the California School Employees Assn., which represents 
Centinela Valley clerks, maintenance workers, cafeteria workers and other 
non-teaching employees, submitted the petition to the board of trustees 
recently. . District regulations require the board to schedule an election 
within four months so employees may vote on the issue.  
</P>
<P>
 A merit system, proponents say, would standardize tests and performance 
requirements used to promote employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The personnel commission would have three members: one chosen by the school 
board, one by the union and the third chosen by the other two members. It would 
be independent of Supt. Joseph Carrillo and the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Relations between the union and the board have been strained for the last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Members remain angry about the board's decision to reduce their work -- and 
consequently their pay -- from 12 months to 10 or 11 months a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of trustees also lowered the cap on its contribution to the union's 
health benefits from $4,550 to $3,900. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that we were all in the same boat," union President Joan Harmon 
said. "If we took a 10% pay cut, then they (administration) did too. Now you 
feel like a yacht is pulling a rowboat -- and we're the rowboat." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrillo said that cuts in the classified employee staff and their salaries 
were necessary and that more cuts may be required. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the perception of CSEA bargaining unit members that . . . the 
classified employees continue to suffer unfair workloads, and unnecessary 
manipulation of their jobs and duties," said a letter submitted to the board by 
J. Travers Devine, union representative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Justified or not, the perception is that normalization of a reasonable and 
productive relationship between the district and its employees will not occur 
under the present administration," Devine wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Union and administration officials dispute how much it would cost to set up 
the commission. "This is happening out of frustration for economic measures . . 
. which neither employer nor employees have control over," Carrillo said. 
"They're looking for something that might help them from impending layoffs. But 
if you're on a fixed income -- and the district is -- you cannot continue with 
the same work force intact."  
</P>
<P>
 The district adopted a $20.9-million budget last year that included 31 layoffs 
and pay cuts for 131 non-teaching employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan to set up a commission is sure to backfire, Carrillo said, because if 
the board has to find money to create a personnel commission, it will most 
likely do so by laying off employees.  
</P>
<P>
 "The average employee who works a regular eight-hour day makes about $27,000 a 
year," Carrillo said. "If you take that and divide it into $150,000, that's 5.5 
people they're saying they'll do without." 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials said a personnel commission would cost the district $40,000 to 
$50,000 a year. Devine said that under an agreement between the district and 
the union, commission members are allowed a stipend of $50 per meeting but no 
more than $200 per month. The commission would hire a director of classified 
personnel and a secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrillo said the figure would be closer to $150,000 to $180,000 yearly, 
including benefits, office space and supplies.  
</P>
<P>
 Harmon said a personnel commission may not prevent layoffs, but it could lead 
to more discussion before decisions are made.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, she said, the administration recommended and the board voted to 
lay off all groundskeepers last year, rather than spread layoffs through the 
ranks of school employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of cutting the maintenance and operation evenly, they laid off all of 
the groundskeepers, the whole classification," Harmon said. "What you have now 
are leaky toilets, lights that are burned out and the maintenance staff so busy 
picking up trash that they don't have time for repairs."

COMMUNITY NEWS: WHITTIER; TAKING A BYTE OUT OF CRIME

<TEXT>
<P>
 After computer thieves hit an East Whittier City School District campus last 
summer, maintenance supervisor Juan Luevanos hit the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillview Middle School had lost six computers -- about $9,000 worth of 
equipment -- after burglars snipped the cables used to secure them.Luevanos 
inspected the cable system, which cost about $75 per computer, and decided he 
could do better. 
</P>
<P>
 He designed a steel cage that wraps around the computer's disk drive and the 
base of the monitor screen. It is bolted to desks on one side by anti-theft 
hinges and secured with a steel padlock on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 The brackets have been attached to 100 of the district's computers so far, as 
well as some televisions and videocassette recorders. The school district plans 
to install the device on all of its 600 computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most computer thefts are the snatch-and-run type thefts, where they want to 
just grab it and get (out). That's what this will prevent," said Gary Drabeck, 
head of the district's maintenance department, which also handles classroom 
security. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is another advantage. The brackets cost $27 apiece, about a third of 
what the district paid for the cables. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are tough times," said Luevanos, 41, of La Mirada, who started his job 
at the district six years ago. "These schools have to watch every penny." JOHN

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; MORE YOUTHS GET VIRUS CAUSING PNEUMONIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A higher number of children are being treated this season for a respiratory 
virus that causes pneumonia, a Long Beach hospital has reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Memorial Hospital has admitted about 300 children since late 
November with respiratory syncytial virus, known as RSV, a common cause of 
viral pneumonia among young children through age 5, officials said.The number 
of cases at the hospital is expected to peak at 350 to 400 this month, up from 
about 240 cases in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "As RSV years go, this is among the heavier we've seen," said Harris Stutman, 
director of pediatric and infectious diseases at Long Beach Memorial. About 
five children with the infection are being admitted daily, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The virus generally is transmitted from adults who show only symptoms of a 
common cold, Stutman said. No children have died this year from the RSV 
pneumonia at Long Beach Memorial. Last year, three children who had underlying 
heart problems died when they contracted RSV, but otherwise healthy youngsters 
are expected to survive the infection, he said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: PARAMOUNT; SCHOOL BOARD TO BAN SMOKING NEXT YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students in the Paramount Unified School District have never been allowed to 
smoke on campus, and now the school board is extending the ban to teachers and 
even parents who might want to light up at their kids' ballgames. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees voted unanimously last week to ban smoking on all district property 
beginning next Jan. 1.Smoking will not be allowed at sporting events or in 
district-owned vehicles. To prepare for the total ban, the board decided to 
restrict smoking to small designated outdoor areas starting March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, employees can smoke in certain designated rooms, such as teacher 
lounges. 
</P>
<P>
 District health adviser Patti Cummings, who helped draft the proposal, said 
the district will launch an anti-smoking campaign and provide help for staff 
members who want to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the policy is designed to be more educational than punitive, but 
employees who continue to smoke on district grounds could be disciplined by the 
superintendent or school board. "I can't see anyone losing their job for 
smoking," she said. "But leverage can be applied if they neglect the policy. 
Peer pressure will help too." 
</P>
<P>
 The ABC Unified School District in Cerritos and the Los Angeles Unified School 
District have passed similar edicts.

COMMUNITY NEWS: NORWALK-LA MIRADA; SCHOOL BOARD DUMPS FAST-FOOD CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Norwalk-La Mirada high school students will have to go back to eating 
cafeteria fare next September after a school board decision to junk a fast-food 
chain's contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Cafeterias at Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District's three high schools 
serve Taco Bell burritos, but some board members complained that Taco Bell was 
charging $1 for burritos at school, compared to 59 cents at the chain's 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members also said the district's cafeterias already prepare fast food 
such as nachos, hamburgers and burritos. "It was duplication of services," 
board member Rudy Bermudez said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members directed staff not to renew Taco Bell's contract when it runs 
out at the end of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell burritos were introduced on high school campuses last fall, partly 
in response to the district's decision not to allow students off campus at 
lunch. Some students said at the time that they preferred Taco Bell's food to 
the cafeteria menu.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CARSON; JAPAN'S GOVERNMENT HONORS CITY CLERK FOR GOODWILL WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRIS YOKOI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Helen Kawagoe always considered herself a "lightweight" in the Japanese 
American community, compared to others she felt were better known for helping 
Japanese Americans and fostering goodwill between the United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Japanese government feels differently. It recently awarded Kawagoe the 
Order of the Precious Crown in recognition of her 20 years of public service as 
Carson city clerk and the many cultural exchanges she has helped organize. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by a certificate with the Japanese emperor's seal and the prime 
minister's signature, the medal is one of the highest honors presented to 
individuals who contribute to the Japanese American community or to the 
strengthening of U.S.-Japan relations.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was so surprised!" said Kawagoe, 66. "I didn't feel I was a heavyweight, 
like the other people whom I'd seen get the award." 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese Consulate in Los Angeles presents the awards to eight local 
people each year. Past recipients include Mayor Tom Bradley, other civic 
leaders and specialists in medicine, agriculture and the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 The consulate considers nominations from local organizations, such as the 
Japanese American Cultural and Community Center and the Japanese Chamber of 
Commerce. In Tokyo, officials painstakingly check the backgrounds of the 
nominees, said Nancy Hamai-Smith of the consulate staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Kawagoe became the first Japanese American woman in the mainland United States 
to hold a municipal office when she was elected city clerk in 1974. She has 
held that office since then and is credited with streamlining the city's 
election procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member and past president of the International Institute of Municipal 
Clerks, Kawagoe has traveled to Japan, Europe, Australia and Israel to promote 
exchanges among municipal clerks around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 A second-generation Japanese American, Kawagoe was born and raised in 
Pasadena. She, her parents and her 13 siblings were sent to internment camps 
during World War II, but the family was able to return to their home in 
Pasadena after the war. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1947 she married Takeshi (Tak) Kawagoe, who died in 1992. "My husband was 
like a stand-up comic. He always made people laugh," Kawagoe said. 
</P>
<P>
 His good humor and support helped the couple endure the loss of their only 
child, a daughter who died at age 5 of brain cancer. Kawagoe said she tells few 
people of this difficult experience, which she said helped influence her "way 
of thinking and looking at life." 
</P>
<P>
 "Tak and I had a greater appreciation for people than for material things," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kawagoe and her husband operated their business, Carson Nursery, from 1962 to 
1971. She also worked three years as vice president of marketing and public 
relations for a savings and loan before she ran for city clerk. IRIS YOKOI

 Tilton Jones is not an extremist. He's not even a vegetarian. But when he was 
offered a room in what will become one of America's only self-sustaining, 
environmentally correct communities, he accepted the offer without hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
 What separates Jones from the rest of wasteful America is his attitude more 
than anything else, he said. "My lifestyle hasn't changed that much. What's 
changed is that I'm living with a group of pioneers trying to live a different 
(way)." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' new home is the Center for Regenerative Studies -- sometimes called 
"Biosphere without a lid," in a reference to the much-publicized $150-million 
Biosphere II in Arizona. On 16 acres surrounded by walnut trees atop a hill on 
the Cal Poly Pomona campus, 18 students, a resident manager and one visiting 
scholar live in several energy-efficient buildings, trying to build and sustain 
a community that will eventually recycle or reuse all its waste, grow its own 
food and stop using fossil fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're more realistic than Biosphere," said Jones, 31, a mechanical 
engineering major from Hawthorne. "We don't live in a bubble. We can come and 
go as we like. I'm a realistic environmentalist. I realize you just can't take 
away people's conveniences."  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Jones and the other center residents are creating energy-efficient 
alternatives they hope will be convenient enough for consumers to use. 
Eventually, 90 people will live in the center and research ways to waste fewer 
of the Earth's expensive and exhaustible natural resources.  
</P>
<P>
 Jones expects to stay three years. By the time his stint is up, he hopes the 
community will waste nothing. The resident students -- from a variety of 
disciplines -- will have learned how to recycle human waste, build rooftop 
gardens and completely convert to solar power, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been given the foundation, and we're trying to make it grow from 
there," Jones said. The center "wasn't outfitted for recycling and solar 
energy. We have to put it together. We have to make it work. We've been given 
the dream and a few of the materials.' 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the center was born in 1976. Prof. John Lyle, who teaches 
landscape architecture, said he thought, "We need to design an environment 
according to ecological principles so that civilization can survive." Right 
now, he said, "the world's not on the right track."  
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Lyle and others were able to secure $4 million in grants, with 
$2.7 million coming from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, to launch the center; an 
additional $6 million is needed to complete the development, he said. "What the 
center is trying to do is design the human environment in a way that is 
sustainable, that works with the natural processes rather than against them." 
</P>
<P>
 Students, who must apply to live at the center, pay $225 per month, excluding 
food. They do research, keep journals that record their energy use, and are 
required to minor in regenerative studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tilton is particularly enthusiastic, and that impressed us," Lyle said. "He 
has a good ability to adapt to conditions that can be difficult. And he is 
genuinely committed to the subject. He had been involved in (environmental 
work) before."  
</P>
<P>
 The route Jones took to the center was circuitous. He grew up in Manhattan 
Beach, where he went to high school. After graduation, "I was a beach bum," he 
said, working at various jobs, including tending bar. "It was just an everyday 
routine with no meaning. In order to find my niche, I had to go away." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones went to a junior college in the Sierra Nevada, where he discovered "a 
more simple way of living. Up there, you could see the problems more. A 
Styrofoam cup in the river really stood out. Before, I'd go to the beach and 
there was trash all over, but I never noticed it because I was so used to it. 
So when I came back to the city, I started seeing things more. The sky wasn't 
blue, and the water was so dirty." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones entered Cal Poly Pomona with a goal: to begin a career as a solar 
engineer, committed to helping communities and individuals devise and use such 
renewable energy sources as the sun, water and wind. 
</P>
<P>
 The research Jones and others are doing at the center "is just one way to 
solve environmental problems in a more realistic way," he said. "We don't have 
all the immediate answers. What we have is a dream that we're working toward. 
But we understand it's going to take time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have to change the way that people look at life. That's the 
only way to change people. And this is one way to let them see another way of 
living."

CITY HALL NEWS: MANHATTAN BEACH; COUNTY PLEA FOR FUNDS REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Manhattan Beach City Council turned down a request from Los Angeles County 
for more money to subsidize lifeguards and beach groomers on the county's 31 
miles of coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing a $400,000 budget shortfall, the county Beaches and Harbors Department 
requested an increase in funding from area cities, including $200,000 from 
Manhattan Beach.The department hires lifeguards for the beaches owned by the 
state, county and cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The city already contributes $220,000 a year collected from parking meters. 
City Manager Bill Smith recommended giving an additional one-time payment of 
$100,000, but council members balked, saying that other cities in the county 
are not being asked to pay their share. 
</P>
<P>
 "Giving (county officials) more money enables them to waste more money," Mayor 
Steve Napolitano said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Hermosa Beach City Council reluctantly agreed in December to 
increase its contribution by $107,000 a year to pay for the services, county 
officials were hopeful that Manhattan Beach and Redondo Beach would follow 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redondo Beach council voted Jan. 25 against boosting its contribution from 
$140,000 to $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Avalon officials agreed last week to increase its annual contribution 
for paramedic and lifeguard services from $46,000 to $300,000. It will reduce 
the county's $400,000 budget shortfall by $254,000, said Ken Johnson, a 
spokesman for the Beaches and Harbors Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he was unsure how the county Beaches and Harbors Department will 
offset the remaining shortfall.

CITY HALL NEWS: TORRANCE; COUNCIL REJECTS BUS LOCATER SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Torrance will not spend $1.1 million to install a high-tech vehicle locater on 
city buses, the City Council decided Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 City Manager LeRoy J. Jackson said the city will improve safety for bus 
drivers by purchasing an "off-the-shelf" radio system instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle locater system uses satellites to automatically relay the position 
of the bus when the driver presses an alarm. The system would have been 
custom-built for the city, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding from the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a 
major contributor to the project, is uncertain, so city staff recommended 
rejecting the costly satellite system. The council vote was unanimous.  
</P>
<P>
 The city Transportation Department had recommended the system after six bus 
drivers were assaulted by passengers in six years. The city has been using 
security guards on some routes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said the city will look for a much simpler system, which he expects to 
bring back for council review in about 60 days. Funding for the system will 
come from a $300,000 federal Urban Mass Transportation Administration grant.

COMMUNITY NEWS: INGLEWOOD; CUTBACKS FORCE LIBRARY TO CANCEL SUBSCRIPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Inglewood Public Library has canceled its subscriptions to dozens of 
newspapers and magazines -- from "Alaska" to "Yoga Journal" -- because of 
recent budget cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Desperate to satisfy the demand for some popular periodicals, library 
officials are asking citizens to help by donating money toward subscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The library has developed a wish list of about 60 periodicals. The list is 
available at the main library, 101 W. Manchester Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Alaniz, the library's director, said canceling the subscriptions should 
save the library about $2,200 in the current fiscal year.

SOUTH BAY / COVER STORY; CYBERSCHOOL; SOUTH BAY CAMPUSES PUT NEW TWISTS ON OLD 
IDEAS WITH HANDS-ON ACADEMIC PROGRAMS THAT STRESS INNOVATION IN THE COMPUTER 
AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For several days last month at North High School in Torrance, the ninth grade 
talked about virtually nothing but dead fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Math classes, using various-colored dried beans, learned how the state 
Department of Fish and Game estimates the number of fish killed in polluted 
water. In physical education, students considered how a pond full of dead fish 
would affect the health of people nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 In science, they studied how polluted water kills fish. And language classes 
concentrated on different cultural beliefs about the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept hearing, 'Oh my God, here it comes again,' " said Principal Timothy 
Scully. "But (students) saw that the subjects are related and how you could 
take a project and relate it to everything . . . After all, no science exists 
purely in application. There's really no such thing as just biology or just 
chemistry or just geology." 
</P>
<P>
 North High is among several South Bay schools on the crest of educational 
reform that are shelving old assumptions about teaching and learning while 
seeking innovative ways to engage students' interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the unusual cooperation among its teachers, North was selected for 
a statewide network arranged to encourage schools to adopt sweeping reforms 
proposed by California's Second to None program. 
</P>
<P>
 Second to None, started in 1992, asks high schools to change almost every 
aspect of school life. The program advises schools to prepare students for work 
as well as college, to create subjects for students to "major" in and to 
promote teacher collaboration whenever possible, so students will learn to 
approach a problem from several perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools competed for $4,000 grants, and the winners organized into local 
networks last month. They were required to pool their money and must decide 
together how to spend it. 
</P>
<P>
 North, Peninsula High School in Rancho Palos Verdes and Mira Costa in 
Manhattan Beach are the only South Bay schools selected for the networks. 
</P>
<P>
 At North High School, Second to None has meant encouraging teachers to 
collaborate with colleagues. Mira Costa is trying to help ninth-graders make a 
smoother transition to high school and to use technology in all aspects of 
learning. Peninsula also is increasing the use of technology and setting up a 
Pacific Rim curriculum similar to a college major program. 
</P>
<P>
 North High created an integrated science course for ninth- and 10th-graders to 
demonstrate how, in daily life, problem-solving can require a combination of 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in a forensics project last month, students analyzed the scene of 
a fabricated hit-and-run, assault or murder. To solve the crime, students used 
principles of biology and chemistry to test blood, fibers, fingerprints and 
hair samples. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to understand about swirl patterns to do the fingerprinting and 
fiber analysis because some fabric filaments won't (show up) under ultraviolet 
light and others will," said teacher Glen Tanaka. "Then they have to determine 
whether they have enough evidence to move ahead and prosecute." During a mock 
trial, Dawn Tsuyuki acted as an attorney presenting evidence to a jury. Tsuyuki 
grilled students posing as medical examiners and other specialists about blood 
under the fingernails of a subject and fingerprints on a gun. The jury finally 
found the "suspect" guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Mira Costa officials determined their school, which is in an affluent district 
and sends about 85% of its students to two- or four-year colleges, had dismal 
computer and technological resources. The school now has two up-to-date 
computer labs for students and has computerized its library. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the recently formed network, school officials hope to learn how other 
schools integrate computers into their classroom lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Mira Costa was selected for the network in part because it aggressively seeks 
grants and partnerships with businesses to help pay for technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just had a demonstration from Microsoft (Corp.) on an amazing new laser 
disc program that showed how kids can take, for example, the solar system and 
learn about it from scientific, historical, mathematical and cultural 
perspectives," Vice Principal Kate Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mira Costa also is working on more effective ways to help freshmen make a 
smoother transition into high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do well in preparing our students for college," said Principal Darlene 
Gorey. But we need to do something for our entering students." 
</P>
<P>
 A team of teachers will help the students understand how expectations change 
in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "In middle school you tell the teacher, 'My dog ate my term paper,' (and the 
teacher says) 'That's fine, turn it in next week,' " Gorey said. "In high 
school you say that, and the teacher says, 'That's fine, and you've failed the 
course.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula High has created a Pacific Rim major for about 70 students who study 
Asian economics, history, cultures and languages for four years. If the Pacific 
Rim option is successful, majors in health and technology may be added, said 
Peninsula Principal Kelly Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technology has to be a part of everything," Kelly said. "We're trying to 
upgrade the technology here, and the goal is to put it in every classroom. We 
would like to have instant communication in each class with a classroom in 
Russia or the Library of Congress or a school in Princeton, N.J." 
</P>
<P>
 Already a school that sends more than 90% of its students to college in a 
year, Peninsula is seeking to improve its track record with students who aren't 
doing as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can everyone be a neurosurgeon?" Johnson asks. "No. But can people always 
reach higher and achieve more? Absolutely." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson uses his own career as an example for students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a janitor at this high school when it was Rolling Hills High School -- 
and I was a good janitor," Johnson said. He tells them success is linked to 
high expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know some people will think that's easy to say because we're in an affluent 
community, but we spend less than $3,000 per kid at this high school," Johnson 
said. Los Angeles Unified School District spends $3,900 per student.  
</P>
<P>
 Expectations are high and rules are few but strictly enforced at the school, 
Johnson said. Students who are late to class seven times or who skip class 
three times must withdraw from the class and attend study hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The high expectations seem to work in physics teacher John McGehee's class. 
</P>
<P>
 At the front of McGehee's room is a poster of Sir Isaac Newton dropping an 
apple with a bite out of it. A UCLA poster leans against a bookcase, and 
posters of planets and a space shuttle round out the physics ambience. 
</P>
<P>
 McGehee is showing a baffling tangle of algebraic equations that he jokingly 
calls "an orgy," on an overhead projector.  
</P>
<P>
 "Oh no, we're talking about orgies and here comes the principal," McGehee 
exclaims as Johnson walks into the room. 
</P>
<P>
 McGehee is teaching the class how to calculate the velocity of two objects 
before they collide, and he is trying to coax the answer from the students. 
</P>
<P>
 In the back of the room, Elyse Co tentatively raises her hand and gives the 
correct answer. The class chatters appreciatively and McGehee hurls her a 
lollipop. Correct answers to his questions are rewarded with candy. Wrong 
answers can inspire McGehee, a UCLA alumnus, to beat up on the USC Trojan 
mascot hanging from the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 On days she isn't tutoring other students, Co can be found in McGehee's 
classroom after school, building a rubber-band-powered car, which each student 
is required to build to study power and velocity. Then it's home to study for 
several hours.  
</P>
<P>
 "You can spend 10 zillion dollars on reform and it ain't gonna do a darn bit 
of good unless that kid will sit down at home," McGehee said. 
</P>
<P>
 McGehee, who was given a Presidential Award for Excellence in science and math 
teaching in 1985, also tries to show students that physics is not just an 
exercise in abstract ideas but something that contributes to their fun. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been taking his physics students to Magic Mountain for years so that 
they can see vividly the properties of mechanics and energy.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have them do seven 'physics olympics' events using the rides and they have 
to solve all kinds of problems," he said. "In fact, the next olympics is coming 
up soon. We always go the Sunday before Einstein's birthday." 
</P>
<P>
 Which, for the physics neophyte, is March 15.

COVER STORY; BEACH EROSION; WAVES CONSTANTLY RESHAPE SANDY STRIP BETWEEN 
EXPENSIVE HOMES AND SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Hey, we better call the water company," O.B. Hughes said to his wife one 
evening a few years ago. "It looks like a water-main break." Standing at his 
front window, Hughes could see water burbling like a mountain brook across 
Ocean Boulevard, the Alamitos Bay peninsula's main drag. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was no problem with pipes. This was one of the Pacific Ocean's 
periodic visits to the Hugheses' Long Beach neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Every couple of years or so, the sea prances over the bulkhead next to the 
peninsula's beachfront houses, makes itself at home in people's garages, soaks 
into carpets and then -- like a hotel guest stealing towels -- departs with a 
big chunk of the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The city fights back, bringing in truckload after truckload of sand -- 25,824 
cubic yards of it last year -- scooped up from wider beaches to the east. But 
the sea keeps coming, dashing over the wall or just gnawing, gnawing, gnawing 
at the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, at high tide, waves have been lapping perilously close to the beach 
houses between 62nd and 64th places, and a stretch of beach next to the 
Alamitos Bay jetty, once a popular surfing spot, has been dissolving like sugar 
in the waves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We dump sand there (next to the jetty) every day, and it just washes away," 
said Rosie Bouquin, capital projects coordinator for the Long Beach Department 
of Parks, Recreation and Marine. "It's really scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, an unusually high tide sent water rushing over a five-foot 
sand berm city workers had constructed, lapping over the boardwalk near a house 
at the corner of 64th Place and Ocean Boulevard. The sea nuzzled against the 
front door and rushed around the side to flood the back patio. Then it receded, 
taking about 50 feet of the beach with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never had that before," said a woman who lives in the house. She asked 
that her name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Beach erosion -- whether it is an implacable wearing away of the shoreline or 
a sudden loss of big scoops of sand -- is a problem that beachfront cities from 
Santa Barbara to San Diego have been struggling with for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 And like other California cities, Long Beach finds itself tackling the big 
problems with less money. In recent years, the state has seized ever greater 
shares of property taxes and revenues from city oil wells, while the recession 
and Defense Department cutbacks were shrinking other sources of municipal 
income. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget problems or not, residents of the peninsula -- where homes cost between 
$600,000 and $700,000, with beachfront houses going for as high as $2 million 
-- want the city to do more for their disappearing beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been furious about the whole thing, the way we keep losing the beach 
time and again and they keep promising to replace it," said the woman with the 
flooded patio at 64th Place. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a dilemma, city officials concede. The beach, which three years ago was 
an expansive 150 feet from boardwalk to ocean, was recently down to 25 feet 
near the point where seawater flooded the back-yard patio. It dwindled to 
virtually nothing at the east end eight blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 So what to do? 
</P>
<P>
 The first line of defense against beach loss has always been the city, which 
tends to the shoreline. Aside from its annual rebuilding efforts, using heavy 
equipment to dump sand into the skinny parts, the city has spent $3.5 million 
in recent years on experimental solutions, some of them fanciful enough to be 
right out of an H.G. Wells story. 
</P>
<P>
 City workers have planted rows of artificial kelp in the harbor on the theory 
that undulating plastic leaves would stabilize the sand. They have laid a bed 
of 70,000 cubic yards of pea gravel in front of the narrow beach sections in 
hope that the coarse gravel would hold the finer sand. They have built a "reef" 
out of "sand pillows," two-ton nylon bags of sand, to try to slow the waves. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing worked for long. 
</P>
<P>
 "You won't stop erosion," said Preston Smith, a retired dentist who has become 
one of the peninsula's most outspoken beach preservationists. "You just try to 
slow it down." 
</P>
<P>
 But with the new budget constraints, the city is under pressure to come up 
with the final solution, said Phil Hester, parks manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The costs of fighting beach erosion, more than $500,000 last year, are 
soaring, city officials say, and other beach communities have demands of their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ninety percent of our beaches are not affected by erosion," Hester said. 
"Those people want us to work on trash removal. The other 10% want us to work 
on erosion. We just don't have the resources to move sand all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Should the city invest in new protective structures to keep the sea away from 
the peninsula beach or resign itself to paying to reconstruct the beach every 
time the sand washes away? 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council, acting on a motion by Councilman Douglas S. Drummond, who 
represents the peninsula area, has directed the city's nine-member Marine 
Advisory Commission to hold hearings on the problem to determine how the 
community wants to solve it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't afford to replenish the beach with sand year after year," said 
Drummond, who has pressed for a long-term remedy, maybe another rock jetty 
extending at a right angle from the tip of the existing jetty. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk like that makes peninsula residents nervous. It's not that the city would 
abandon their beach to the waves, residents say. It's that city officials might 
feel compelled to build another seawall to block the open sea altogether. "If 
we're enclosed in a horseshoe," Smith said, "it will cut off all circulation." 
</P>
<P>
 Without the cleansing of waves and currents, Smith says, the peninsula would 
soon begin to look like the notorious West Beach area where the Los Angeles 
River empties into the sea, near the Queen Mary. 
</P>
<P>
 "That darkness there -- algae," he said, pointing westward with a look of 
distaste. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime residents of the peninsula, a tidy two-block-wide community of about 
2,000, tend to be philosophical about the give and take with the sea. "It's 
hell on your Persian rugs," laughed one resident. But it's part of life there. 
</P>
<P>
 A winter storm could blow in any day now, O.B. Hughes and others point out, 
rumbling through the gap between the breakwater and the jetties that define the 
channel into Alamitos Bay, leaving a ragged row of rocks where sand used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever there's a high tide backed by a storm, that's when we can get a real 
beaut," said Pat Kempster, who has lived on the peninsula more than 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's those storms from Baja," said Hughes, a retired high school coach, 
looking edgily to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Geologists and oceanographers who have studied beach erosion in Southern 
California blame it largely on the rising level of the sea and the grinding of 
tectonic plates against each other, creating a steep coastline that is 
vulnerable to fast-moving waves. But man-made structures have been speeding up 
the process, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Development, both along the shore and inland, has interrupted the natural 
cycle of loss and replenishment, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
 Dams and flood basins in the Santa Monica and San Gabriel Mountains are 
bulging with the sandy material that used to wash down stream beds to nourish 
the beaches. Man-made seawalls prevent cliffs from crumbling and feeding the 
beaches with new sand. And the beaches are starving. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rivers are all cemented in," said Douglas Inman, former director of the 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography. "They're no longer sand-yielding rivers." 
</P>
<P>
 Water in the world's oceans has been rising since the early Middle Ages at a 
rate of about 20 centimeters per century. "It doesn't sound like much, but put 
a few centuries together and you've got significantly deeper water," Inman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists estimate that by 2100, with industrially related global warming 
bringing even more water from polar icecaps, there could be as much as three 
more feet of water in the oceans, lapping hungrily at oceanfront communities. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, it is the beaches that stand between the irresistible 
force of the ocean and the not-so-immovable object of oceanfront homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beach is a dissipating medium," Inman said. "Waves break and all the 
wave's energy is extended across the surf zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Without those broad buffers of sand to absorb the power of storms and slow the 
waves, beach dwellers can suddenly find themselves eyeball to eyeball with a 
moving wall of water carrying all of the destructive power of a pile driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Kempster shows snapshots of herself and a friend on the peninsula during the 
"hurricane" of 1939. The storm -- not really a hurricane but a particularly 
violent squall -- carried most of the peninsula beach away, and waves rained 
down in billowing sheets on the two young women, cringing giddily on the 
boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us it was fun," Kempster said. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the residents whose houses were either swept away or left high and dry 
on skeletal pilings, the storm was a graphic demonstration of the vulnerability 
of beachless coasts. 
</P>
<P>
 A century ago, the Long Beach shore was broad and untouched, with new sand 
washed in by the Los Angeles and San Gabriel rivers to make up for the losses 
from storms and longshore currents. "Some considered it the finest beach in the 
country," said Smith, who has made the study of erosion one of his passions. 
</P>
<P>
 In a normal year, probably between 200,000 and 300,000 cubic yards of sand 
washed down from the mountains, as an equivalent amount was swept down the 
coast by currents, oceanographers say. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1899 workers began a project that would take nearly 50 years -- 
building the breakwater to protect the shore from currents and head-on storms, 
establishing the sort of wave-free environment necessary for Long Beach Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 There followed the U.S. Naval Station, the Long Beach Naval Shipyard and, at 
the east end of the city, the Alamitos Bay jetties, extending 2,000 feet into 
the ocean. Meanwhile, 20 miles to the north, Los Angeles County was building 
its vast flood control system, a 2,500-mile network of open channels and 
underground storm drains, with 15 major dams and 354 debris basins to capture 
sand and rocky material. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1946, Long Beach was sealed off from the open sea except for a two-mile gap 
between the end of the breakwater and the tip of the jetties at the border with 
Orange County. The city's beaches had become the most protected in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 And there still have been erosion problems. 
</P>
<P>
 It is through the gap, due south of the peninsula, that the storms and those 
gnawing winter waves arrive. "Winter waves tend to be smaller and quicker, like 
lawn-mower blades," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with all the construction in place, the beach began to narrow and widen 
unpredictably. 
</P>
<P>
 There were times when a bather -- a reckless one -- could have done a swan 
dive into the sea from the peninsula boardwalk. There were times when the beach 
was luxuriantly broad, particularly after dredging operations in the 1960s and 
1970s deposited tons of sand on the shore. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, as far as an army of beach consultants has been able to 
determine, the sand appears to have been washing away from the east end of the 
peninsula and accumulating near the west end. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultants still have not pinpointed a cause, but the results are 
striking. A boat-launching ramp at Claremont Avenue, 12 blocks west of the 
point where ocean waves have been lapping against houses, jutted into the sea 
two years ago. Now the ramp is more than 100 feet from the waves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It comes and it goes," said Bouquin, the capital projects coordinator. "The 
problem is holding a continuous piece of beach." 
</P>
<P>
 The trend nowadays is against "hard solutions" to keep beaches from eroding, 
scientists say. At its most extreme, the trend says: Leave the beaches alone 
and allow them to find a natural balance, even if it means losing beachfront 
homes and piers. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke University geologist Orrin Pilkey, the most outspoken proponent of 
allowing the beaches to follow their own course, says that seawalls and other 
types of hard structures have been built to protect the rights of wealthy 
property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're the ones who create difficulties of access to the beaches and create 
a demand for building more seawalls, taxing the many to save their beaches," 
said Pilkey, though even he concedes that urban recreational beaches should be 
protected. 
</P>
<P>
 On the peninsula, however, people who live in million-dollar beachfront homes 
have joined with renters and less well-to-do homeowners to try to keep the 
beaches as natural as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 A meeting of the Alamitos Bay Peninsula Beach Preservation Group can sound at 
times like a conclave of civil engineers, with lawyers, real estate agents and 
construction workers talking knowledgeably about berms, wave energy and dynamic 
contouring. 
</P>
<P>
 The consensus is that the city is obliged to keep shoveling sand their way. 
"The beach is one of the city's most valuable assets," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has persuaded city officials to try some soft approaches, such as 
building a sandy bulge -- a salient -- near the critically narrow part of the 
beach, in hopes that it will deflect some of those destructive currents. 
</P>
<P>
 Some scientists see nothing wrong with protecting the beaches. They're part of 
the urban infrastructure as much as parks or streets, says Scripps 
oceanographer Reinhold Flick, who advocates a policy of "constructive 
interference." 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California beaches are largely man-made, Flick said. Beaches between 
Santa Barbara and San Diego have been bolstered and artificially widened with 
100 million cubic yards of sand, mostly from large dredging operations before 
1960. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a city," Flick said, talking generally about Southern California 
beach communities. "Fine. You've got to change the bulbs in the street lights. 
So you change the sand every once in a while. So what?" Cost of Erosion 
</P>
<P>
 Expenditures by the city of Long Beach to fight Alamitos Bay Peninsula beach 
erosion. 
</P>

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: BREWING UP A CULINARY FEAST

<P>
 In the past several years, Southern California has seen the opening of several 
brew pubs -- bars that make their own beer. While it can be debated which one 
makes the best beer, there is little argument that the best food among the 
growing population of South Bay brew pubs can be found at the Redondo Beach 
Brewing Co. in the Hollywood Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
 What sets the Redondo Beach Brewing Co. apart is that one of the pub's owners, 
James Brown, just happens to be the brother of Christine Brown, the executive 
chef of the acclaimed Fino in Torrance. Christine recently revamped the menu at 
the pub, and now the RBBC is a worthy destination even if you don't like beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most brew pubs, it has a familiar selection of appetizers -- Buffalo 
chicken wings, curly French fries and onion rings. But the menu gets quite 
interesting in the pasta and pizza department. The most popular pasta is penne 
P.V. ($7.50), a plate of straight macaroni tubes with grilled chicken breast, 
mushrooms, tomatoes, green onions, Parmesan and tortilla chips in a chipotle 
pepper cream sauce. Farfalle ($7.50) comes with chicken sausage, zucchini, 
mushrooms, and garlic swathed in a roasted sweet red bell pepper sauce. Not 
exactly typical bar food. 
</P>
<P>
 The RBBC also offers a sophisticated version of that beloved culinary duo beer 
and pizza. To go with the 20 styles of ale, there are six pizza offerings, such 
as one made with chunks of barbecued chicken, mozzarella, smoked Gouda and 
sweet red onions ($7.50). The vegetarian pizza ($6.95) holds a mix of 
mozzarella and Fontina cheeses, red and yellow bell peppers, artichoke hearts, 
diced tomatoes, mushrooms, red onions, and fresh basil that is colorful enough 
to pass for Renoir's palette. 
</P>
<P>
 Beer drinkers will have fun sampling the various ales, which are available in 
five-ounce tasting glasses for $1. One of the more popular selections, Bohemian 
Pilsner, is patterned after Czechoslovakia's world famous Pilsner Urquell. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redondo Beach Brewing Co. is at 1814 S. Catalina Ave., Redondo Beach; 
316-8477. Open seven days 11:30 a.m. to 1 a.m.

 PICKING UP THE PIECES 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, the Carson High basketball team was playing at a high level. 
The Colts were 12-4 and tied for the Southern League lead at 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was before the season was interrupted by the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
After a two-week layoff, what type of basketball should we expect from City 
Section teams? 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably very ugly," Carson Coach Richard Masson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Masson's prediction is understandable. Most City teams were scheduled to 
resume play Wednesday after not having games since Jan. 14. Naturally, the long 
layoff is bound to affect everyone to some degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although we've been practicing since (Jan. 25), it has been ragged," Masson 
said. "You lose an edge conditioning-wise, and you lose an edge in executing 
the little things you went through the whole preseason to get to." 
</P>
<P>
 Carson was scheduled to play at Dorsey on Wednesday, the first of seven games 
the Colts will play in three weeks in order to complete the regular season by 
Feb. 18. The playoffs were originally scheduled to begin Feb. 18, but have been 
pushed back to Feb. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a lot of games in three weeks," Masson said. "For teams with a lot of 
talent, it probably won't make a huge difference. But for everybody else, it 
will have an effect." 
</P>
<P>
 Masson said Carson is in a difficult position because its first three 
post-earthquake games are on the road, the result of adding make-up games to 
the schedule. The Colts play at Washington on Friday and at Banning on Monday 
before playing host to powerful Crenshaw on Wednesday. PLAYOFF CHANGES 
</P>
<P>
 The City basketball playoffs will be seeded and played under a different 
format this season. 
</P>
<P>
 A seven-member committee headed by first-year athletics Commissioner Barbara 
Fiege will conduct a seeding meeting Feb. 19 to determine the 16-team draws for 
the 4-A and 3-A division playoffs. This breaks from the tradition of having 
coaches in charge of the meeting, a free-for-all process that led some to argue 
that coaches who yelled the loudest often received the most favorable draws. 
</P>
<P>
 The other notable change is that higher-seeded teams will no longer be awarded 
home games throughout the playoffs. After the first round, the team having the 
fewest number of home games will be designated as the home team. When both 
teams have had an equal number of home games, a coin flip will decide the home 
team. This is the way the Southern Section conducts its playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. City has been a laughingstock for quite a while," said Carson's Masson, 
a member of the section's basketball advisory committee. "I think these are 
ways to make (the playoffs) more equitable." BOMBS AWAY 
</P>
<P>
 Chadwick, led by the sharpshooting duo of Neil Thakur and Todd Ammons, is 
closing in on the Southern Section record for most three-point field goals in a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins entered Wednesday's Prep League game against Flintridge Prep with 
216 three-point baskets. The section record is 234, set by Rolling Hills in 
1989-90. Chadwick has already passed the 1988-89 Rolling Hills team (203) for 
second place on the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Tom Maier said the Dolphins rely on three-point baskets out of 
necessity. Their tallest player, Ammons, is 6-foot-2. 
</P>
<P>
 A lack of height didn't hurt Chadwick in a 78-60 nonleague victory over 
Brethren Christian on Saturday. The Dolphins made 15 of 28 three-point shots, 
eight by Ammons, who scored 33 points, and six by Thakur, who scored 32. 
</P>
<P>
 Thakur, a senior guard, leads the team with a 25-point average. Ammons, a 
junior forward, averages 21 points. Chadwick entered the week 14-7. MAN FOR ALL 
SEASONS 
</P>
<P>
 Is there anything Phil Fonua can't do? 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, the 6-2, 265-pound junior was a dominating force at fullback and 
nose tackle, helping Mira Costa win the Southern Section Division VII football 
title, the school's first. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Fonua has turned his attention to basketball, with similar results. 
</P>
<P>
 Matched against one of the area's top centers, Fonua scored a game-high 16 
points and grabbed 10 rebounds Friday to lead Mira Costa over host Beverly 
Hills, 52-45, in an important Ocean League game. 
</P>
<P>
 Fonua outplayed Beverly Hills' Luke Buffum, a highly regarded 6-7 senior. 
Buffum scored 10 points, well below his average. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave Mira Costa (17-5, 5-0 in league play) a two-game lead over 
Beverly Hills with three to play. The Mustangs can clinch the Ocean title 
Friday night at home by beating Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 Fonua's talents don't end with football and basketball. He is scheduled to 
compete in the shotput at the Sunkist Invitational track meet Feb. 19 at the 
Sports Arena, but he might withdraw if Mira Costa is still competing in the 
playoffs. His best mark in the shotput is 55 feet 6 1/2 inches. RECRUITING NEWS 
</P>
<P>
 Two Leuzinger standouts joined a lengthy list of area football players who 
plan to sign letters of intent with four-year colleges. The monthlong signing 
period for prep seniors began Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Leuzinger Coach Fred Boehm said wide receiver Jason Sharp will sign with 
California and defensive back Jason Simmons will sign with Arizona State. 
Simmons, who played quarterback for the Olympians, was also recruited by UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The following is a list of other area players who were expected to sign. Most 
have already given unwritten commitments: 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive linemen John Welbourn of Peninsula and Tate McCallister of Mira 
Costa (California), Peninsula offensive lineman Matt Redman (Iowa), Hawthorne 
receiver-defensive back Justin Stallings (Washington State), Carson offensive 
lineman Damien Howard (Nevada Las Vegas), Carson defensive back Daks Blanks 
(Northern Arizona), and three players bound for Utah State -- defensive back 
London McBride and running back Melvin Blue of Banning and defensive back Ukeje 
Agu of South Bay Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Peninsula All-American Mimi McKinney, one of the Southland's top girls' 
basketball players, made her first recruiting trip last weekend to Virginia. 
Her hostess was former Peninsula center Jeffra Gausepohl, a Cavalier sophomore. 
McKinney has visits planned to Arizona and Auburn. SOUTH BAY CLASSIC 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor College, ranked eighth nationally and third in the state, will open the 
baseball season Friday as co-host of the inaugural South Bay Classic with El 
Camino. 
</P>
<P>
 In 2 p.m. home openers, Harbor plays L.A. Valley and El Camino meets Mt. San 
Jacinto. Rounding out the eight-team field are East L.A., Rancho Santiago, 
Oxnard and Mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor, winner of three state titles and eight consecutive conference 
championships, expects to have one of its better teams. The Seahawks return 
seven starters from last season's 30-13 team. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners for Coach Tony Bloomfield's squad include infielder Grant Hohman 
(St. Bernard High), catcher Jeff Poor (El Segundo), shortstop Jay Uhlman 
(Redondo), infielder Ryan Shannon (Torrance), outfielder David Mauney (Carson) 
and pitcher Mark Chavez (Banning). One of the top newcomers is outfielder Chris 
Feeny (El Segundo), a transfer from the University of San Diego. PLAY BALL 
</P>
<P>
 The Loyola Marymount baseball team opens the season with two home games 
against National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics schools, playing Concordia 
University at 2 p.m. Friday and Biola College at 1 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions' first game against a Division I opponent is at 2 p.m. Tuesday when 
they visit Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-year Loyola Coach Jody Robinson welcomes back 15 lettermen, including 
seven starters from last season's 23-33 team. Leading the way is junior third 
baseman Jesse Ibarra, a preseason All-American who batted .299 and hit 17 home 
runs last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions' roster also includes several South Bay products, including junior 
pitcher Brian Fitzgerald (West Torrance High), junior first baseman John 
Mastandrea (Loyola High, Rancho Palos Verdes resident), sophomore infielder 
Paul Lemire (Miraleste), junior third baseman Brian Shackelford (St. Bernard, 
Inglewood resident) and freshman pitcher Vince DiLeva (Mary Star). BASEBALL 
REUNION 
</P>
<P>
 El Segundo High will have its annual baseball alumni game and reunion Saturday 
at Recreation Park. Batting practice begins at 10 a.m., followed by a home run 
derby at 12:45 p.m., introductions at 1 and the game at 1:05. 
</P>
<P>
 All former Eagle varsity baseball players from 1927 to 1989 are invited to 
play in the game, matching odd-year graduates against even-year graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 Autographed baseballs by former El Segundo standout George Brett will be on 
sale for $35. Admission is $3 for adults and $1 for children. ROB FERNAS

ENTERTAINMENT; CARPENTER CENTER IS SLEEK, SHOCKPROOF

<P>
 The new Richard and Karen Carpenter Performing Arts Center aced its first big 
test, enduring the recent Northridge earthquake unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fared well," center executive director Rich Kerlin said between recent 
aftershocks. "We had no broken glass, no structural damage." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,162-seat hall at Cal State Long Beach seemed to handily survive another 
trial last week with the presentation of its first touring troupe, Susanne 
Linke's modern-dance company of Frankfurt, Germany. Although there were some 
gripes, many in attendance gave the place a thumbs-up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a nice theater," said Neil Elliott, a Redondo Beach engineer. 
"It's impressive, it's big." 
</P>
<P>
 "The seats are really comfortable," said Michelle Wilson, a Cal State Long 
Beach communications major. 
</P>
<P>
 The $27-million center, a crescent-shaped, streamlined facility completed in 
December, will present events ranging from Tex-Mex music to film to comedy. It 
operates under a public-private partnership with the university, where siblings 
Karen and Richard Carpenter majored in music in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of signage on the center itself or posted on nearby streets was a 
common complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spent 15 minutes driving around" before finding it, said Los Angeles 
choreographer Rose Polesky. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior signs identifying seat rows would have helped too, patrons said. And, 
while many admired the theater's gently curved, floor-to-ceiling glass facade, 
its airy lobby and muted purple, aqua and burgundy color scheme, some wished 
for adornment on its expansive blank walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need a Chagall mural," like that inside New York's Metropolitan Opera 
house, said Ricardo Trimillos, a UCLA visiting professor of world arts and 
culture. "When you look in from outside, it's very sterile." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Kerlin, the theater will have signs installed at its main 
entrance, at street entrances to its 700-space, front-yard parking lot, as well 
as signage inside, guiding patrons to restrooms and to seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Artwork will be added to the walls, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many patrons, however, praised the new facility, named in honor of Richard 
Carpenter's $1-million donation toward its endowment. It was designed by Irvine 
architect Kurt Gibbs, who designed the college's new arena, still under 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Steeply raked seats providing easy viewing and its acoustics won high marks.  
</P>
<P>
 "Both speaking voices and recorded sound were very clear," said Trimillos, who 
also is a musician and ethnomusicologist. "The sight lines were very good too. 
We sat about eight rows back, near stage left, but we took a walk around the 
entire hall" before the performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The capacity can be scaled back to 765 seats for smaller events. The center's 
large stage, modeled after the New York State Theater's, is 70 feet wide and 65 
feet deep, officials said, and has a so-called floating floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Dancers in Linke's athletic piece, "RUHR-ORT," who tromped, jogged and flung 
their bodies onto the stage, pronounced it "perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's big and wide and like a stage for dance is supposed to be," said Ari 
Fastman, who has performed around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Large dance troupes, from New York City Ballet to the Martha Graham Dance 
Company, may be booked at the center, Kerlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But much of its programming will target the area's "underserved and 
underrepresented audiences," he said, including gays and lesbians, Latinos and 
seniors, in order to avoid competition with local producing arts organizations 
or other nearby theaters. The Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, the 
Terrace Theater in Long Beach and the Orange County Performing Arts Center are 
each roughly within a 20-minute drive, he said.

 Construction was financed with state bonds, but it will operate without 
additional government subsidy. Its initial operating budget, Kerlin said, will 
be about $500,000 annually, generated from facility rentals, ticket sales, 
parking fees and other revenue sources.

 The center's first full season begins Feb. 12 with the Nat Adderley jazz 
quintet. It will proceed with comedian Paul Rodriguez (March 12), the San 
Francisco Girls Chorus (March 27), the Joe Goode Performance Group (April 16), 
and country/Tejano singer Tish Hinojosa (May 5).

THEATER; 'LADY'S MEN' FOCUSES ON LERNER, LOEWE'S STORMY RELATIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Show business partnerships are sometimes stormy. That's the price of blending 
volatile talents into an artistic whole. The team of Alan Jay Lerner and 
Frederick Loewe was no exception, but their differing lifestyles, the sharp 
contrast in their personalities and professional integrity didn't keep them 
from creating some of the century's most memorable musical theater scores. 
</P>
<P>
 This dichotomy is at the core of William Graham's one-man show about the duo, 
"Lerner & Loewe: My Fair Lady's Men," playing Friday at the Norris Theatre in 
Rolling Hills Estates, and Saturday at Brea's Curtis Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "For people who know anything at all about them, it certainly is no secret 
that they were not compatible individuals," said Graham, remembered for his 
previous show, "Cole Porter: One of a Kind."  
</P>
<P>
 "As Fritz Loewe says in the show, the papers make them out to be happy 
brothers, but that was not true. He says sometimes it's like being tied to the 
devil himself to work with Alan." 
</P>
<P>
 Lerner was inclined to shirk his duty in turning out lyrics for Loewe to set 
to music, particularly in his later years when he was under the influence of 
"Dr. Feel Good," an infamous New York doctor who treated his patients with 
heavy doses of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Loewe, known to friends as a happy-go-lucky type, often found himself forced 
to reveal a less cheerful personality in his dealings with his partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham didn't want his "Lerner & Loewe" to be another "and then I wrote . . ." 
kind of a show. He wanted to go beyond his subjects' professional lives and 
show what made them the richly endowed creators they were. His detailed 
research into their personal peccadilloes, he feels, give the show depth and 
shading beyond the surface enjoyment of their music. 
</P>
<P>
 It also gives Graham more opportunities as an actor and playwright. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to think of myself as three different artists," he says. "I'm an actor. 
I'm a pianist. And I'm a singer. In this show it works out pretty well, because 
Fritz Loewe was a concert pianist, so this gives me a chance to try and play a 
piano well. In the second act I become primarily a singer. This gives me a 
chance to sing the songs and dwell upon the lyrics." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing both roles is challenging, he says, "how to come back after 
intermission and become a completely different figure, so people don't say, 
'Hey, there's that guy we just saw, with a wig.' " 
</P>

 ON THE RUN 
</P>
<P>
 One of the largest fields in years is expected for Sunday's 13th annual Long 
Beach Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Fernald, the race's executive director, said the event, which begins at 
7:30 a.m., could match the size of the 1990 marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year's registration numbers have increased substantially and I won't be 
surprised if we get more than 3,000 (entries)," Fernald said. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of favorites includes Sam Rotich of Albuquerque, N.M., in the men's 
division and Maria Trujillo of Salinas, Calif., in the women's division. Rotich 
has finished second the past two years and Trujillo won the women's division in 
1991 in 
</P>
<P>
 2 hours 35.50 seconds and was second in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other men who are expected to be among the front-runners are Jose Ramone 
Ramirez of Mexico City, with a best of 2:15, and Aurelio Rodriguez and Genero 
Tavares of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Other women runners considered as favorites are Kathy Bowman of Bellingham, 
Wash., Terry Schmidt of Reno, Nev., and Maria Gomez from Brazil. Bowman's best 
time is 2:35.20. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be $21,200 in prize money distributed to the top finishers in the 
open men's and women's divisions and the men's and women's masters and 
wheelchair divisions. The top men's and women's finishers in the open division 
will each receive $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected to lead the way in the women's wheelchair division is defending 
champion DeAnna Sodoma, who set a course record with a time of 1:57.10 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the athletes who will compete in the marathon, 3,000 children are 
expected for a mini-marathon, in addition to about 50,000 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 Runners can register until 7:30 a.m. on Sunday. Information: Fernald at (310) 
494-7089. ON THE ROAD 
</P>
<P>
 After snapping its losing streak with two wins at home last week, the Long 
Beach State men's basketball faces perhaps its most difficult road trip of the 
Big West Conference season when it visits UC Santa Barbara and Nevada Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers (10-5, 5-3 in the Big West) will play Santa Barbara at 7:30 p.m. 
Saturday at the Thunderdome and UNLV at 9 p.m. Monday at the Thomas and Mack 
Center -- two places where they haven't won since the 1987-88 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara has been struggling at 8-11 and 4-5, but the Gauchos defeated 
the 49ers, 82-66, on Jan. 22 at Long Beach. UNLV is 9-7 and 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers turned in one of their better performances of the season in a 91-69 
win Saturday over Cal State Fullerton. Forward Mike Atkinson and guard Rod 
Hannibal led the way. Playing his best game since he injured an ankle against 
Nevada on Jan. 10, Atkinson led Long Beach with 24 points and Hannibal had 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Hannibal, a senior from Long Beach Poly, scored a career-high 29 points in the 
49ers' 111-106 overtime victory against UC Irvine last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The next home game for the 49ers is Thursday against Pacific. BATTLE FOR NO. 1 
</P>
<P>
 First place in the South Coast Conference will be at stake when the Cerritos 
College men's basketball team plays host to Long Beach City at 7:30 p.m. 
Saturday at Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons defeated Long Beach, 93-82, in the first half of the conference 
season Jan. 15 at Long Beach. The teams split two nonconference tournament 
games in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos is 21-4 and 5-0, and Long Beach is 19-6 and 4-1. The teams appear 
primed for the rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos, ranked No. 2 in the state behind Ventura by the JC Athletic Bureau, 
used the inside play of center Javan Rouzan and the outside work of guards 
Kelly Hambrick and Ryan Brass for an 80-69 victory against Mt. San Antonio last 
week. Rouzan, the team's leading scorer and rebounder, had 25 points and 11 
rebounds against Mt. San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth-ranked Long Beach tuned up for the Falcons with a 116-73 victory over El 
Camino. The Vikings have been sparked by forwards Marc Neal and Kevin Beal and 
guard Marcus Rogers. Long Beach has also benefited from the return of forward 
Chris Blanton, who appears to have recovered from a knee injury early in the 
season. IMPACT PLAYER 
</P>
<P>
 Former Glenn High standout Faye Hagan has made quite an impression in the 
seven games since she became eligible to play for the Cal State Dominguez Hills 
women's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan, a 5-8 sophomore who transferred from Division I Cal State Fullerton, 
has averaged 14.7 points and 10.1 rebounds. Hagan, a two-time All-Suburban 
League selection who was also named All-Southern Section Division II as a 
senior, averaged 5.3 points as a freshman at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan ranks among Dominguez Hills leaders in scoring and rebounding. Teammate 
Trimecka Jackson, a former standout at Long Beach Poly High and Long Beach City 
College, is averaging 11.8 points and 10.5 rebounds. PLAY BALL 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State will unveil its 1994 baseball team when it plays an 
exhibition against its pro alumni at 1 p.m. Saturday at Blair Field. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers, who finished third at the 1993 College World Series and are ranked 
in the top 25 in preseason polls, will meet an alumni squad that features major 
league pitchers Tom Urbani of the St. Louis Cardinals and Steve Trachsel of the 
Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Other players for the alumni include first baseman Scott Talanoa of the 
Milwaukee Brewers and outfielder Darrell Sherman of the Colorado Rockies. The 
Long Beach varsity is expected to be led by pitchers Mike Fontana and Gabe 
Gonzalez. BRIEFLY 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach State men's volleyball team, ranked No. 10 in the nation by 
Volleyball Monthly, won its first Mountain Pacific Sports Federation match of 
the season with a three-game sweep of UC San Diego on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers, coached by Ray Ratelle, who is in his 13th season as coach, 
defeated the Tritons by scores of 15-9, 15-2 and 15-7. Long Beach, which is 
playing at Hawaii this week, competes in a tournament at San Diego State next 
weekend before returning for its home opener against UC Irvine on Feb. 16.

 Robert Fernandez, a 13-year-old from Whittier, has advanced to the Silver 
Gloves national boxing tournament today through Saturday in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez, who fights in the 125-pound intermediate division, has a 10-2 
record since starting his amateur career in November, 1992. He won the Southern 
California, state and regional tournaments to advance to nationals. MITCH POLIN

MAYOR KELL'S VIEW ON NAVY LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I agree completely with Mayor Van Nostran on only one point in his recent 
letter (Dec. 30) to your newspaper. It is indeed a shame that Lakewood must 
spend one penny on its efforts to derail the Long Beach Base Reuse Plan.That 
money should be directed instead to participating with Long Beach in our 
efforts to save the naval shipyard and support the C-17 production efforts. 
Lakewood has always been strongly absent from such causes which, by Mayor Van 
Nostran's logic, must be regionally significant. Instead, they are requiring 
Long Beach to spend time, energy and money defending a reuse strategy which 
includes the regional benefits of port expansion, a University Research Park, a 
new high school, homeless housing and job training, all because they are 
threatened by the competition of one relatively small component of our overall 
reuse strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 We do not dispute that other cities have an interest in the defense 
downsizing. But, amazingly, they have had little interest in working with us to 
minimize the impacts by retaining the bases and defense jobs in the first 
place. After all, Long Beach has provided the land for the naval station, the 
naval hospital and the university, all of which are regional economic 
generators. We even provided the land for the Hawaiian Gardens Civic Center. To 
deprive this city, with a population of 436,000, of the opportunity to develop 
a 1-million-square-foot power center because the owners of Lakewood's 
2.5-million-square-foot mall are doing poorly is a travesty, and should be held 
up for what it represents -- greed! 
</P>
<P>
 That there is a market niche for this center is indisputable.

TAKING A STAND AGAINST UNIFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am a seventh-grader at Charles Evans Hughes Middle School and am upset about 
the recent decision regarding uniforms (Times, Jan. 20). I think this is a 
totally unnecessary measure. 
</P>
<P>
 I understand the desire to keep our schools gang-free, but why should those of 
us who aren't gang-related have to suffer? How bad could the problem be in 
elementary schools? 
</P>
<P>
 Uniforms will not solve the gang problem. Gangs always find a way to let 
people know who they are. Also, we don't need uniforms to feel safe and 
unthreatened at school. In my two years at Hughes, neither I nor anyone I know 
has been bothered by a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 In middle school, we are at a stage in our lives when fashion is very 
important to us. It's a way of expressing ourselves, of finding out who we are. 
At Hughes, the dress code is already extremely rigid. How can anyone take away 
what freedom we have left?  
</P>
<P>
 The 1st Amendment guarantees freedom of speech, which allows everyone to 
express their feelings. Isn't clothing a form of expression? Public schools are 
supposed to represent the positive aspects of America. One of the things that 
Americans are noted for is their individuality. We children will get the wrong 
idea that being different than anyone else is wrong and unwanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Uniformity is not the American way.

WELCOMING THE TET; VIETNAMESE NEW YEAR CELEBRATIONS FEATURE DRAGON DANCES AND 
FRESH STARTS, AMONG OTHER THINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick VanderKnyff is a free-lance writer who contributes 
regularly to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a tumultuous January in Orange County's Vietnamese American community. 
</P>
<P>
 In Little Saigon, where anti-Communist feelings run high, passions have been 
stirred by Oliver Stone's film "Heaven and Earth," by the U.S. Senate's 
recommendation to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam and even by the visit 
of a popular Vietnamese movie actress, who was labeled a Communist tool by some 
local Vietnamese-language newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the election of a "president" of Southern California's Vietnamese 
American community, intended as an act of unification, ended up bitterly 
divisive. 
</P>
<P>
 A tough way to start the year? By Western calendars, perhaps, but in 
Vietnamese tradition the year is actually drawing to a close. The beginning of 
the lunar new year, the Year of the Dog, is Feb. 10 and marks for many an 
opportunity to start anew and put differences aside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely, it's like the new year in any culture. You have to start the new 
year afresh, to look at it as a new beginning," said Van Tran, spokesman for a 
Tet festival planned in Little Saigon. "People make New Year's resolutions to 
forget their past angers or worries." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County boasts the largest Vietnamese community in the United States, 
and annual observances of Tet (the festival marking the lunar new year) have 
grown each year. The first day of Tet falls in the middle of the week this year 
and will be bookended by two major celebrations: one this weekend in Huntington 
Beach at Golden West College, expected to draw 70,000 or more, and one the 
following weekend in the Little Saigon area of Westminster that could attract 
more than 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Another, smaller festival will be held Saturday at the Vietnamese Community 
Center in Santa Ana. The center caters to seniors, but the Tet celebration is 
open to everyone and will begin with a traditional dragon dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of both events say Tet is an opportunity to promote traditional 
culture and keep it alive among the younger generation of Vietnamese Americans, 
many of whom fled Vietnam at a very young age or were born in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a traditional Vietnamese New Year's celebration," said Frances 
The-Thuy Nguyen, one of the organizers of the event at Golden West, which takes 
place Saturday and Sunday. There will be dance and music, food, art exhibits, 
martial arts demonstrations and games, along with carnival rides and Vietnamese 
pop singers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal, mainly, is to promote cultural awareness," she said, especially 
among young Vietnamese Americans. Nguyen has been involved in organizing the 
festival for 10 of its 13 years as a member of the sponsoring group, the 
Westminster-based Union of Vietnamese Student Assn., which joins Vietnamese 
student groups at more than 20 college campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen said she has maintained her involvement since graduation from Cal Poly 
Pomona because she knows how hard it can be for students to maintain their 
cultural roots, and she wants to help. "If they're not involved (in tradition), 
they will lose it," said Nguyen, who came to the United States in 1975. "I have 
to kind of maintain both cultures. I didn't speak English before I came here." 
</P>
<P>
 Tran agreed that history can seem remote to younger members of the community. 
Tet, he said, is "an opportunity to revisit that history, especially for young 
people like myself, who have lived two-thirds of our lives here." 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, the Tet festival in Little Saigon has been sponsored by the 
Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce, but this year it has been taken over by an 
independent committee of nine, including three non-Vietnamese. Tran said the 
goal is to turn what has been a largely commercial celebration back to a more 
traditional flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme for the festival is "United We Build for the Future," and Tran said 
that is intended to mean not only unity within the Vietnamese community but 
also unity between different ethnic groups. To that end, organizers have 
invited performers representing the Korean, Laotian, Cambodian and Latino 
communities to take part in the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, Tet has had a reputation that it is insular, only for the 
Vietnamese," Tran said. That is an image he is hoping to erase, noting that Tet 
offers an introduction to Vietnamese culture for those who are unfamiliar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be a cultural experience for anyone who hasn't visited the Little 
Saigon area," he said. "In many ways, it's no different from any other 
festival, like the Orange County Fair or the California State Fair." 
</P>
<P>
 No different in its general atmosphere of festival but distinctive in its 
particulars. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Tet traditions recall those of the Chinese lunar New Year, celebrated at 
the same time. Children in both cultures are given money in red envelopes by 
their parents, and then by other relatives as they spend the day visiting. In 
Vietnam, the tradition is called li xi . 
</P>
<P>
 "I can still remember this as a child in Saigon," Tran said. "It's almost like 
trick or treat." 
</P>
<P>
 Other traditions that appear similar, at least on the surface, include a 
dragon dance -- performed only for royalty in feudal times -- and the use of 
firecrackers, the sound of which (according to tradition) will drive away evil 
spirits or haunted souls. 
</P>
<P>
 As in China, in Vietnam the years are named for animals, in 12-year cycles 
(although there are some differences between the two cultures in the animals 
symbolized in the cycle). 
</P>
<P>
 In Vietnam, Tet is also heralded by a profusion of bright yellow peach 
blossoms, mai , and by a number of traditional foods. Chief among these is banh 
chung , a square cake of glutinous rice with a circular filling of pork and 
cooked beans, served with pickled cabbage and carrots. Also known as an "earth 
cake," banh chung is a symbolic representation of the ancient view of Earth and 
sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Also popular are watermelon seeds, roasted and dyed red ( hat dua ), along 
with fruit preserves ( mut ), five kinds of fruit, collectively called ngu qua 
and sweet white rice cakes ( banh day ). 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to feast and celebration, Tet is a time of ancestral worship and 
of many wishes for prosperity and harmony in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dat Vo, another organizer of the Golden West festival, said that in Vietnam, 
Tet is a weeklong celebration, the biggest holiday of the year and anticipated 
much the same way Christmas is in European cultures. "In Vietnam, the children 
cannot sleep at night" before Tet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in the United States, especially when the first day of Tet falls in the 
middle of the week, it can be difficult for workers or students to properly 
celebrate -- Vo remembers getting out of lab at 9 p.m. when he was a student 
and rushing to temple for Tet.  
</P>
<P>
 Many local Vietnamese Americans say they look forward to a day when they can 
return to Vietnam, to visit if not to stay. Although travel is becoming more 
common, many will not go back until there is a new government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope that someday, we can go back to Vietnam and celebrate the New Year 
together," Vo said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the games and carnival rides, the food booths and contests, this 
weekend's Tet festival at Golden West College will offer something new and 
unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "My Vietnam: My People, My Homeland" is an elaborate, eight-minute slide 
presentation focusing on the Vietnam of today. The project is the brainchild of 
Costa Mesa resident Pascal Tran, a professional photographer who came to the 
United States 17 years ago, at age 15. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to Vietnam in September and snapped 120 rolls of film in a month 
of travel. When he returned, he secured the underwriting of long distance phone 
company MCI and began work on the presentation, working with creative director 
Greg King and audio producer Stephen Bittle at Killingsworth Productions in 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of their monthlong effort is a lush travelogue that focuses on 
details of everyday life in Vietnam, aspects that survived the war and almost 
20 years of Communist rule: quiet rural scenes, depictions of family life, 
girls in traditional white dresses cycling to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran said his goal was to evoke the essence of the country for those who fled 
in the aftermath of the war, and to give a sense of the landscape and lifestyle 
to those who are too young to remember or who were born here. It is a 
resolutely apolitical view. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you mention Vietnam, people think about war," Tran said. In the slide 
show, "no war will be even mentioned. There is no politics. . . . The idea is 
to bring Vietnam to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Tran said he realizes that some may criticize him for traveling to Vietnam or 
may misunderstand his intentions and believe he is soft-peddling the effects of 
Communism. Nothing could be further from the truth, he said. 
</P>
<P>

BULLY FOR HIM!; WILSON USES MEAN-SPIRITED CHARACTER AS SPRINGBOARD TO COWBOY 
TOMMY, NICE GUY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, Glenn Doggrell writes about comedy for The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Talk about a classic case of miscasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than being 6-foot-2 and weighing 200 pounds, Tom Wilson is woeful bully 
material. He's thoughtful, measures his words carefully, plays music at church 
with his wife, Caroline, and likes to spend time with their three daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 His selection to play Biff in the "Back to the Future" trilogy is even more 
surprising when you compare his speech with that of the character. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson: "The stairway to being a big star is a journey taking a lot of 
serendipitous events, which may or may not take place." 
</P>
<P>
 Biff: "What are you looking at, Butt-head?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson: "I like my show to be participatory. By bringing a few people onto the 
stage, others can live vicariously through those members." 
</P>
<P>
 Biff: "What are you looking at, Butt-head?" 
</P>
<P>
 And so on and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, however, doesn't regret playing Biff, Griff and Buford (Mad Dog) 
Tannen in the trilogy. Not in the least. 
</P>
<P>
 "The movies are classics," Wilson said from his Encino home, after cutting 
short a call on another line to start the interview on time. "They were a 
tremendous thing to be a part of. I wouldn't trade it for the world. But the 
fact remains it's a very large and difficult shadow to walk out from behind. 
Admittedly, I'm in the process of doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 Helping him do that is his latest venture, "Cowboy Tommy's All-American 
Round-Up." In fact, the one-man show -- playing at the Brea Improv through 
Sunday -- owes a debt to the Michael J. Fox trilogy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was filming 'Back to Future 3,' " Wilson recalled. "And performing that 
bad-guy character every single day gave me the idea to dress up as the ultimate 
good-guy singing cowboy. I did it one day as a joke. Everybody came up and said 
I should do it, the last singing cowboy in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried it as a bit in my stand-up act, and it struck a chord with the 
audience. They were coming up and telling me the cowboy was great." 
</P>
<P>
 An L.A. club owner liked the bit, too, and gave Wilson stage time to expand 
his "Tommy." The bit is now a fine-tuned 50 to 60 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 One hurdle Wilson had to overcome was the audience. Typical stand-up crowds 
expect -- demand, actually -- rapid-fire monologues. Wilson is giving them a 
slower-developing, theater-like piece. It doesn't help that he's generally the 
third act to take the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm following other performers in a very different style. I was asking the 
audience to pay attention, but it wasn't funny right away. Plainly, a stand-up 
audience is not willing to (wait)." 
</P>
<P>
 So Wilson took matters into his own hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm applying stand-up skills from over 15 years and injecting them into the 
show. Injecting those skills into the Cowboy Tommy character has been 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the Philadelphia native has Cowboy Tommy up and singing, he's trying 
to turn the character into a TV series, working with Universal Studios and 
Global TV, a Canadian network. 
</P>
<P>
 "We signed a development contract, and now it's a matter of writing out a 
script." 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the works is a new movie, "Camp Nowhere," with "Back to the Future" 
buddy Christopher Lloyd, who plays a crooked camp counselor. Wilson is a state 
trooper who smells a rat. Shooting is scheduled to start in the middle of this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just heading forward, not to any particular place," Wilson, 34, said. "I 
enjoy being on stage and in film. I plan on continuing that, paying attention 
to interesting things." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson got his start in entertainment as a freshman at Arizona State 
University, where he studied theater for a year. He went from there to the 
American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York and basement acting seminars. 
</P>
<P>
 "You remember people lying on the floor, reliving painful childhood memories? 
I was among them," Wilson said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was 19 and doing "Richard III" in summer stock, Wilson followed some 
friends into stand-up, starting at a small Pennsylvania club. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since then, I've done both," said Wilson, who moved to California in 1981 to 
pursue TV and films. "People tend to think of you as just one thing. I don't 
have just one thing to offer. What I'm most proud of in my career is showing 
versatility. In our media age, though, that doesn't lend itself to a great deal 
of celebrity. You need to align yourself with one thing." 
</P>
<P>
 In his stand-up routine, which he still performs every couple of months, 
Wilson looks to his own life for self-deprecating storytelling. He also throws 
in a bit of tuba playing, which some fans will remember him doing on his 
"Tonight Show" debut in 1990, when he led the audience in a football march 
song. The bit went over so well, Johnny Carson invited him back. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite its early success, the instrument has been relegated to 
second-chair status.  
</P>
<P>
 "My tuba is now in the garage, waiting for my next stand-up foray," Wilson 
said. "But I'm sure Tommy will someday play tuba." 
</P>
<P>
 A tuba-playing, singing cowboy. That untapped niche might be the one thing 
Wilson could hang his hat on. 
</P>
<P>
 Who: Tom Wilson in "Cowboy Tommy's All-American Round-Up."

<P>
 When: Today, Feb. 3, at 8:30 p.m.; Friday, Feb. 4, at 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.;

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: JOHN CALE "PARIS 1919" (1973) REPRISE  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the great benefits of the compact disc revolution is that hundreds of 
underappreciated -- indeed, previously deleted -- albums have been given new 
life. Among them: John Cale's "Paris 1919," an inspired, sometimes elegant 
work, arguably the iconoclastic Welshman's most accessible effort.Some of the 
melodies here are so rich and enticing that it's hard to understand why this 
album didn't make more of a commercial dent when it was released more than 20 
years ago. The opening "Child's Christmas in Wales," for instance, is an 
instantly inviting dose of upbeat pop laced with a tad of bluesy rock 'n' roll 
courtesy of some members of Little Feat. Still, there is a striking complexity 
to much of the material here. The elegiac "Endless Plain of Fortune" is 
flavored by artfully arranged strings, horns and percussion, and the exotic, 
hypnotically moody title track has a similar classical-pop coloration (a 
founding member of the Velvet Underground, Cale is a classically trained 
musician). Lyrically, "Paris 1919" also is far more sophisticated than the 
average pop album; Cale tells poetic, occasionally cryptic tales (talk about 
literary: two of the tracks are called "Macbeth" and "Graham Greene"). Yet 
rather than sounding stuffy, Cale's words tend to interlock naturally with his 
compellingly melancholy (if technically limited) baritone. JON MATSUMOTO

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: OYSTERBAND "HOLY BANDITS" RYKODISC  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This veteran English folk-rock band may have contracted its name from two 
words to one with its latest release, but "Holy Bandits" is full of music with 
an expansive spirit. Factor in Oysterband's Celtic roots, the elegant side that 
enters with the use of string orchestrations, and an ability to muster a 
slashing, full-on guitar rock attack, and you have an expansive sound as well. 
</P>
<P>
 These assets are united on a cohesive album that carries a strong group vision 
of how the world can wear out strivers, stomp on underdogs, and yet not quite 
vanquish those who hold to their ideals and inner fire. While reggae is one 
roots-music strand you won't hear from the Oysterband, "Holy Bandits" is 
kindred to Bob Marley's "Natty Dread" as a chronicle of struggle and 
comradeship. Like Marley, singer John Jones and his mates know that part of the 
burden of the songwriter who takes on weighty issues is, in the reggae great's 
words, to "lively up yourself" from time to time by throwing down the burden 
and having some fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Holy Bandits" opens with a couple of rollicking, defiant songs set to wild 
Irish strains, then slows for more plaintive and reflective moments that 
acknowledge that pumped-up spirits are fleeting, after all, while struggles are 
never-ending. The album grows darkest toward the end, but the stance remains 
unyielding, with a final, comically upbeat wedding song suggesting that 
perseverance has its momentary but real rewards. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of the Pogues should take to this like leprechauns to rainbows; U2 
admirers pining for the rattle-the-battlements days of "War" and "The 
Unforgettable Fire" also could do worse than ordering Oysters. MIKE BOEHM

WANNA DANCE?: 2 BENEFIT SHOWS FOR A ROCKIN' CAUSE

 The quake that rocked and rolled Southlanders out of their beds two weeks ago 
could be written off as a memory for most Orange County residents, whose only 
inconvenience was losing a little sleep or having to straighten a picture or 
replace knickknacks on a shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 While it's easy to avoid the incessant TV coverage on the disaster by escaping 
to a nightclub or bar, some folks in the local music scene aren't letting 
patrons off so easy. Nightclub owners, promoters and bands are trying to shake 
off the apathy with a pair of concerts next week to benefit the American Red 
Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides putting only a tiny dent in your pocketbook, the shows are a perfect 
opportunity to check out what's happening among local alternative bands -- all 
in the name of a good cause. All proceeds from both shows will go to the Red 
Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 First up, on Sunday, the Electric Circus in Anaheim will hold Richter Relief, 
a marathon charity benefit featuring 21 bands in 11 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Club owner Allen Ornstein organized the event in part because of relatives 
living in Northridge, the quake's epicenter, who suffered from the Jan. 17 
temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Just $4 gets patrons of all ages a wristband with in-and-out privileges during 
the 1 p.m. to 2 a.m. concert. Additional money and donations of clothes and 
canned food will also be accepted. Ornstein estimates the event will draw about 
2,000 fans throughout the day; the club holds a maximum of 400 patrons at any 
one time. 
</P>
<P>
 Local performers include Joy Ride, National Peoples Gang, Lidsville, Sol and 
Bitch Funky Sex Machine. Each band will jam for a 25-minute set. 
</P>
<P>
 Local sponsors involved in getting equipment, printing posters and 
coordinating the show include the county-based Bionic Records chain, Dr. Dream 
Records in Orange, Band West of Anaheim, Little Caesar's Pizza and the Nomad 
Production Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Electric Circus will keep its kitchen open throughout the day, serving a menu 
of burgers, hot wings and other Americana fare. 
</P>
<P>
 Richter Relief, Sunday, Feb. 6, at Electric Circus, 314 N. Beach Blvd., 
Anaheim. (714) 826-9686. Cover is $4. Hours: 1 p.m. to 2 a.m.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In Huntington Beach, "Shake, Rattle & Rock," a showcase of live music ranging 
from rap to blues, will hit Wednesday, courtesy of Club 5902, Lethal Records 
and club promoters J.P. Productions. 
</P>
<P>
 The event will feature Lethal recording artists Rule 62 and Raggabash, in 
addition to bands not on the Fullerton-based indie label such as Bitch Funky 
Sex Machine, Back Lash, the Grabbers, Milk N Honey and Manhole. Not to be 
missed is the last band, Manhole, from Los Angeles, which dishes out a caustic 
mesh of funk-flavored rock fronted by a hard-core rapping female. 
</P>
<P>
 The lineup is hush until the night of the show, according to organizers. A 
minimum donation of $6.60 is requested, and doors open at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shake, Rattle & Rock," Wednesday, Feb. 9, at Club 5902 is at 5902 Warner 
Ave., Huntington Beach. (714) 840-6118. Cover is $6.60. Hours: 8 p.m. to 2 a.m.

 Tonight and every Thursday night hereafter, the Newport Beach super-club 
Bacchus becomes Alive, with guest host Bonzo. Live bands will perform weekly, 
debuting this evening with local favorites, the Shrinky Dinx. The Inside 
performs acoustic sets through the month in the VIP room, while deejays 
Scorchman and Ewok spin the vinyl in the dance rooms. This is one night when 
you can see the Egyptian-themed fantasy club for cheap. Cover is only $5. 
</P>
<P>
 Alive at Bacchus, 3505 Via Oporto, Newport Beach. (714) 675-8712. Hours: 9 
p.m. to 2 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Irvine comes out of the closet this weekend with the opening of the Sunday 
night-only PleasureDome at Metropolis. "Boys will be boys" is the motto, but 
everyone with an open mind is encouraged to dance the night away, promoters 
say. D.J. Eddie-X of the Temple in L.A. will spin the tunes. The club and its 
sushi bar, Octopussy, will open at 7 p.m. Drink specials run from 7 to 9 p.m. 
Freebies include condoms. 
</P>
<P>
 PleasureDome at Metropolis, 4255 Campus Drive, Irvine. (714) 725-0300. Cover

JAZZ; SAYING HELLO TO ERA THAT IS GOODBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, Bill Kohlhaase is a free-lance writer who regularly covers 
jazz for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a note of truth in the title of bassist Charlie Haden's upcoming 
recording, "Always Say Goodbye" (Verve). The Los Angeles resident says "goodby" 
often in his travels across the country and to Europe, giving concerts and 
seminars individually and with his Quartet West. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, for instance, will find him at the University of Virginia in 
Charlottesville, where he will be joined by other distinguished bassists -- 
Dave Holland, Milt Hinton and Richard Davis -- in a clinic on jazz history and 
the role of the bass. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Haden, 56, will discuss jazz as a music of protest and will 
conduct a student version of his Liberation Orchestra and choir in the kind of 
politically minded material that has made Haden's large ensemble one of the 
most honored on the planet. On Saturday, he'll be back in California, leading 
Quartet West at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 While the orchestra plays jazz arrangements of politically inspired music, 
European and Latin American folk songs and Haden originals, Quartet West has 
taken a more romantic view. The quartet's new album will follow the format of 
the previous three, Haden says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seeks to evoke feelings of Los Angeles during the '40s and '50s, and the 
days of film noir , Raymond Chandler, the art deco architecture and all the 
things that were part of the Los Angeles culture in that time period," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 What results is a romantic mix of ballads, be-bop and originals from Haden and 
pianist Alan Broadbent that mirror a time since lost. Rounding out the quartet 
are saxophonist Ernie Watts and drummer Larance Marable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to touch people's lives," says Haden, "in a way that causes them to 
think of that era which was more peaceful, deeper, and more meaningful. I'm not 
saying that that period was better than this one, but it's a time that is 
deeply fascinating to me. We're not dwelling on the past, but playing in the 
present, inspired by the depth of that period and its emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quartet West is also about the improvised art form of jazz," continues Haden, 
who was born in Iowa and traveled with his family's country band before moving 
to Los Angeles as a teen-ager. "When we play together, magical things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Who: Charlie Haden's Quartet West. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Saturday, Feb. 5, at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: The Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Centre Drive, Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: San Diego (405) Freeway to Bristol Avenue exit north, turn right 
onto Town Center Drive.

 Orange County has a Black History Parade again after a two-year absence, and 
organizers say the return of the event is helping to bring local African 
Americans together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our whole premise and our slogan for this year is building unity in the 
community," said Chuck Mosely, one of three main organizers for this year's 
parade and cultural fair. "It's the common thing that everybody wants." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Black History Parade will begin Saturday at 10 a.m. at 
Broadway and 15th Street in Santa Ana and will proceed along Broadway to Santa 
Ana Stadium. The stadium will be the site of the cultural fair, from 11:30 a.m. 
to 5 p.m., which will feature continuous live entertainment, food, craft and 
merchandise booths, children's activities and rides. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Carroll, a local news anchor, is grand marshal. Admission to both events 
is free. For information, call (714) 850-1577. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosely said he was frustrated by the inability to organize a parade in the 
past two years. "There were many false starts," he said, but this year things 
have been different: "It's brought about a sense of unity and a sense of 
wanting to help." 
</P>

DO IT!: LONG BEACH RACE ADDS HALF-MARATHON AND RELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick VanderKnyff is a free-lance writer who regularly 
contributes to The Times Orange County Edition.

<P>
 The Long Beach Marathon, returning for its 13th year Sunday, is one of the 
prime marathons in Southern California and is consistently rated among the Top 
20 nationwide by running magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that success, however, organizers have been hurt by the general slump 
in registration numbers that have hit running events, particularly marathons. 
So this year, they've expanded the event to attract non-marathoners and boost 
overall participation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest change is the addition of the half-marathon and the relay," said 
Jay Beeler, a spokesman for the event. "The goal of the marathon this year is 
to get more community involvement. One way to do that is to get those people 
who don't feel like tapping their total body strength" by running the 26.2 
miles of a full marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 There's more entertainment this year, too, with more than 40 musical groups 
lining the marathon course, from Bach to rock, said spokesman Hugh Siler. The 
nearby Queen Mary will sound its horns at the 8 a.m. start of the runners' 
marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 The relay is designed for five-person teams. The first four members will run 
five miles each, and the fifth will do the final 6.2 miles. The event was 
introduced on a limited basis last year, primarily to test the logistics before 
expanding. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no immediate danger to the marathon's future, but organizers wanted 
to halt the downturn in attendance, which has afflicted even the biggest events 
in the country, such as the Boston Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing what we can to keep it rolling along," Beeler said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-'80s, when running was in its heyday, participation in the Long 
Beach race was in the neighborhood of 4,000. Last year's race drew 2,100, but 
this year organizers had almost that many registrations 10 days before the 
event, and expect 2,500 or more runners, wheelchair racers and race walkers. 
</P>
<P>
 The marathon course, which follows the shore for much of the way, is 
essentially unchanged. Course records for the event are: men, Rex Wilson at 2 
hours, 12 minutes and 27 seconds, in 1989; women, Olga Appell at 2:30:43 in 
1992; men's wheelchair, seven-time winner Jim Knaub, 1:38:47 in 1991; women's 
wheelchair, DeAnna Sodoma, 1:57:10 in 1993; men's race walker, Timothy Lewis, 
3:28:39 in 1986; women's race walker, Jeanie Mendelson, 4:19:56 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 In last year's trial run of the five-person relay, the winners (from Long 
Beach Millikan High School) came in at 2:39:00. 
</P>
<P>
 The top three finishers in both the men's and women's categories will win 
$5,000, $3,000 and $1,000, respectively. Cash prizes of $500 to $100 will be 
awarded to the top finishers in the masters (40 and over) and wheelchair 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
 A health and fitness fair will take place after the race, free to competitors 
and $3 for the general public. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Long Beach Marathon (with half marathon and team relay). 
</P>
<P>
 When: Sunday, Feb. 6. Race-day registration will open at 6 a.m.; race walkers 
will take off at 7:30 a.m., wheelchairs at 7:55 a.m., runners at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Long Beach Convention Center, 300 E. Ocean Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: From the Long Beach (710) Freeway southbound, exit at Broadway. 
Go east to Long Beach Boulevard and turn right; follow signs to available 
parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $40 for marathon, $30 for half-marathon, $125 per team for relay. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to call: (310) 494-2664.

SURFING / ROCKIN' FIG & DAVE: QUIETLY, EPOXY BOARDS MAKE INROADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rockin' Fig & Dave, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington Beach 
surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. surf 
teams competing in Bali and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A quiet revolution in the making of epoxy surfboards has been taking shape, 
and Rockin' Fig supports the evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Most modern surfboards are shaped from polyurethane foam blanks, wrapped in 
fiberglass cloth and sealed with polyester resin. Epoxy boards use a 
super-light Styrofoam core and the same fiberglass cloth but are sealed with a 
super-hard epoxy resin. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of people seem to like them, and they're gaining in popularity. But 
conventional boards still outsell epoxies, 4 to 1.  
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason for that is epoxy boards cost about $100 more than 
conventional boards, and many surfers are aware only of the first-generation 
epoxies, which had their drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Fig, why are people buying the new ones? They worth the extra money? 
</P>
<P>
 They're really light, they have a good strength factor and are more buoyant in 
the water than conventional boards, especially when you hit the white water -- 
they kinda just go whooooosh.  
</P>
<P>
 One thing about epoxy boards, however, is they're susceptible to heat. Surfers 
who leave them in a parked car where interior temps can soar can soften the 
blank and cause the board to delaminate. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier Huarcaya-Pro, a 34-year-old Peruvian surfer now living in Oceanside, 
laminates epoxy blanks for dozens of shapers and surf shops. Already, epoxy 
boards are popular in Australia, Europe and South America, he said last week 
during an interview at the Action Sports Retailer trade show in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 For the generally small Southern California surf, light and maneuverable 
surfboards are the ticket. But the lighter you go, the greater chance for the 
polyurethane boards to dent, ding or snap in two. This is where paying extra 
for the latest epoxy boards can actually save you money in the long run. And 
for heavy-set surfers who are hard on boards and need flotation, the epoxies 
are tougher and more buoyant than their super-light polyurethane counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Early generation epoxy boards, Huarcaya-Pro said, were shaped from Styrofoam 
blanks, covered with fiberglass cloth and sealed with epoxy resin. But the foam 
was open-celled. When dinged, the blank would soak up water like a sponge and 
take a week to dry before the ding could be repaired, a definite minus when 
compared to polyurethane cores, which dry in a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, Huarcaya-Pro uses lighter and stronger extruded Styrofoam, 
similar to that used in Styrofoam coffee cups but with a wooden stringer down 
the middle for strength. He then bakes them in large ovens at 134 degrees for 
nearly four hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is something much different than earlier epoxy surfboards, which 
weren't baked, didn't have stringers and used the water-sucking Styrofoam. 
</P>
<P>
 Huarcaya-Pro acknowledges the misunderstandings of epoxy boards but thinks the 
new models will convert the cynics. He should know. He has a bachelor's in 
industrial engineering from the University of Lima, and his thesis was on the 
epoxy surfboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The extruded Styrofoam is a denser, closed cell than the earlier blanks," 
Huarcaya-Pro explained. "Unlike the earlier boards, the new one's will not fill 
with water and they're stronger. One more thing, they're recyclable." 
</P>
<P>
 Huarcaya-Pro and his Styrofoam blank supplier, Pedro Vasquez, owner of SVF Co. 
in Oceanside, said that Dow Chemical, which makes the new blank, has developed 
a way to reuse excess foam and old blanks. They can be ground up into pellets 
for making new blanks. Also, any excess foam can be glued together to make a 
whole board. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regular boards using polyester resin are OK," Huarcaya-Pro said. "But that's 
the technology of the '60s. These epoxies are finally fitting in with the 
environmental '90s."

KIDS ON FILM: HILARIOUS ACE TRACKS LAUGHS AS BLUNDERING 'PET DETECTIVE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for The Times' View section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective," TV comic Jim Carrey plays a goofball 
investigator who tackles the theft of a famous dolphin -- the mascot of the 
Miami football team -- and in the process sends up other famous movie moments, 
including the surprise from "The Crying Game." (Rated PG-13.)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Carrey is funny. Head lowered, neck out, eyes full of childlike 
enthusiasm, his whole face quivers and stretches into places no human face has 
ventured before. 
</P>
<P>
 In this movie, kids -- especially those familiar with Carrey's Fire Marshal 
Bill character from "In Living Color" -- loved him hands down.  
</P>
<P>
 The film itself, however, earned mixed reviews.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing much to the plot; it's not involved or anything," said Tod 
McGill, 13. "It was a little corny, (but) it was funny enough to make it good. 
It was funny because (Carrey) was always overacting. For his first movie, he 
did really well." 
</P>
<P>
 Like "Wayne's World" without the wit, this movie celebrates adolescent boys' 
humor: slapstick, bathroom jokes and raunch. Mostly, it seemed to attract and 
delight boys 12 to 14, who laughed straight through from the beginning credits, 
when Carrey in a delivery-man disguise manhandles a box marked "fragile," to 
the ending credits, when he picks a fistfight with another football mascot, a 
parrot. 
</P>
<P>
 One group of boys, pumped up by TV trailers and the celebration of a friend's 
birthday ("the Big One-Three"), couldn't praise "Ace Ventura" enough. Asked to 
rank it on a scale of 1 to 5, they variously awarded the movie a 5, a 6, a 7 
1/2 and a 99. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's laugh after laugh," said birthday guy Chris Defarkas, sounding 
suspiciously like a plant from the publicity department. "There isn't a slow 
moment."  
</P>
<P>
 His friends all waved two thumbs in the air; some mimicked Fire Marshal Bill, 
while others hoped for a sequel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm there," said Shane Ellis, 14. 
</P>
<P>
 But teen-age boys weren't the only ones who liked the teen-age boy humor, as 
Jon Hugstad, 14, pointed out. "I had an older gentleman sitting next to me. He 
was laughing just as hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Shane said his favorite part was one that made some other kids uncomfortable 
-- a scene in which a woman's true sexual identity is discovered by a telltale 
bulge in her skivvies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was dying!" he said. "I watched 'The Crying Game,' and I got that part. And 
the music just added to it. It was 'Crying Game' music."  
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany Thair, 11, was also dying, but for another reason. "It was just kind 
of sick," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Mike Wile, 13, said he also saw the R-rated "The Crying Game" and thought it, 
too, was sick. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that I had dinner, and I didn't even feel good enough to eat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another group of boys gave the movie lower marks -- a 4, a 3 and a 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was funny, but it had no plot," said Evan Kennedy, 12. 
</P>
<P>
 As I recall, and none too easily, the story line follows the laughingstock pet 
detective Ventura as he traces a tiny gemstone found in the empty dolphin tank 
to the rings awarded in a past Super Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 He tracks down every team member (while jogging, in the shower, mailing a 
letter, at a fancy cocktail party) to check out their rings, before he finally 
narrows down the list of suspects.  
</P>
<P>
 "The plot kept changing," said Elliott Rushovich, 13. "They kept making it 
more funny so you wouldn't really care if you didn't understand it, because it 
was so funny."  
</P>
<P>
 Like me, they agreed Carrey can be hilarious. I was amazed by his on-target 
imitation of a football player in slow motion and then in reverse. But a little 
goes a very long way. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they had a sequel, that would be overdoing it," Tod said. "It would be too 
much of a funny thing."

SPECIAL SCREENING: BITTER CRUELTY IS LEGACY OF 'HEIRESS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Heiress" has one of Hollywood's more memorable lines: "Yes, I can be very 
cruel . . . I've been taught by masters." 
</P>
<P>
 That bit of spleen is uttered by Olivia de Havilland near the movie's end. Her 
face is darkened with taut vindictiveness, even sadism. The masters she's 
talking about are the father of her character, Catherine Sloper, and the gigolo 
who seduced her. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1949 picture, screening Friday night as the latest installment in UC 
Irvine's "Tragedy and Comedy" series, is all about cruelty. It's based on one 
of Henry James' cruelest novels, "Washington Square," and as an adaptation, 
it's true to the book's meanness. 
</P>
<P>
 De Havilland won an Oscar as best actress for her performance, and it must 
have been more for the last 30 minutes than the more than an hour that precedes 
it. Her portrayal as the early, naive Catherine is fraught with fidgety, 
girlish overacting (her blundering seems more silly than complex), but when 
Catherine is finally left with a bitter heart, watch out. De Havilland 
transforms her into a quiet gargoyle, able to exact vengeance with a tight 
smile of glee. 
</P>
<P>
 The story settles on Catherine, a plain girl with the self-conscious shyness 
of a born neurotic. We know right off that this moth has the beautiful soul of 
a butterfly (something about her pained, overly aware eyes), but all of life 
ruins and distorts her. She can't seem to do anything right, except embroidery, 
which her domineering father (Ralph Richardson) routinely points out. 
</P>
<P>
 Director William Wyler pushes relentlessly at the bitter relationship between 
father and daughter but somehow keeps the simmering contentiousness genteel, 
even refined -- the tale is, after all, set in New York high society. In this 
respect, Wyler captures the politely mannered viciousness of James' novel. 
</P>
<P>
 The father, a successful doctor, lives in a past populated by his now-dead but 
once beautiful wife. Catherine can't compare with her memory, and her father 
won't let her forget it. When she puts on her mother's red dress in a desperate 
effort to please, he frowns, abruptly telling Catherine that her mother was 
lovely and "dominated the color," something she'll never do. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, like a miracle too good to be true, arrives Morris Townsend (Montgomery 
Clift), a handsome, liquid-tongued suitor with one obvious defect -- he has no 
money. With his eye on the prize of her large inheritance, he woos Catherine, a 
frail game too easily snared. 
</P>
<P>
 But her father sees through his scam and intervenes, leaving Catherine in a 
vise created by the two men and her conflicted emotions. Catherine's cynical 
revelations about her father and Morris, really the only men in her life, is 
the gyre on which "The Heiress" turns. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson and Clift are outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially fine is Richardson, conveying with ease the father's deeply rooted 
and complicated motivations, based on an almost savage disappointment, for 
mistreating his daughter.  
</P>
<P>
 Clift's performance reminds us once again what a remarkably natural actor he 
could be. He was Brando before there was a Brando. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: William Wyler's "The Heiress." 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Friday, Feb. 4, at 7 and 9 p.m.

AT MANGIA MANGIA, PATRONS ARE MOTIVATED TO EAT, EAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for The Times Orange County Edition.

<P>
 The sound system was playing "That's Amore" when we sat down to eat our first 
dinner at Mangia Mangia. Call me a curmudgeon, but that is usually a warning 
signal: Red sauce alert. Clear the area . 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, this time we got a reprieve. Chef-owner Pietro Cefalu, the gentleman 
you see behind the stove as you enter, is a fortysomething Sicilian, but he's 
hardly your typical southern Italian chef. He has cooked in various European 
countries, on cruise ships and in several of Italy's major cities. That 
explains why his thrown-together-looking menu of Italian favorites contains 
more than just occasional surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Cefalu is a crackerjack sauce chef and pasta-maker. He also adds rustic 
touches to many of the simple dishes. In his hands, a minestrone soup based on 
a full-flavored vegetable stock is thick with tiny white beans and crunchy bits 
of celery, and sprinkled with pungent Parmesan. He makes gnocchi, those little 
potato dumplings which are tricky for even the best of Italian chefs, that are 
almost light enough to float through the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of being open for nearly seven years at a stubbornly suburban 
location (the intersection of Edinger Avenue and Golden West Street in 
Huntington Beach), Mangia Mangia is still a tough place to get into. Visit at 
lunch, and there is invariably a logjam of young, well-groomed office types at 
the door. Dinners are equally busy, mostly with local families and couples 
looking for a low-priced, romantic spot. You can even expect a gathering at the 
counter, because the restaurant does a healthy takeout trade. My last visit was 
a Sunday evening, and there were more than 15 names ahead of mine on the 
seating list. I didn't mind the wait.  
</P>
<P>
 In appearance, Mangia Mangia is basic -- a large, well-lighted space enclosing 
tables covered by faded red and white checked oilcloths, various framed 
photographs of panoramas up and down the Amalfi coast and an indoor awning 
embossed with the restaurant's name. 
</P>
<P>
 The service is engaging, though, so the room begins to feel warm in short 
order. One evening we were ministered to by a waitress named Francesca, a real 
charmer from Milan who fawned over us like a mother hen, giving us admonishing 
stares when we left food on our plates. ( Mangia mangia means "eat, eat" -- get 
it?)  
</P>
<P>
 So the next time we came hungrier, ate more heartily, and what do you think we 
got? Riiight . Admiring smiles from the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Cefalu's antipasti can be tempting. His calamari fritti are almost as delicate 
as Japanese tempura, fried in oil just hot enough to prevent the batter from 
soaking up an excess. You get a small crock of chunky marinara sauce for 
dipping, though I prefer nothing more than a squeeze of lemon and some chopped 
parsley.  
</P>
<P>
 Vitello tonnato is thinly sliced veal blanketed with a rich sauce containing 
tuna, capers and brandy. This may be one of the smoothest I've ever tasted. One 
complaint: It would be better with plain bread. Cefalu plies his customers with 
an excessively buttery garlic bread that's definitely not Italian. 
</P>
<P>
 There's more in the way of excess here. A typical pasta serving, for instance, 
would feed a small dance band. Take agnolotti , those diaphanous semicircular 
ravioli characteristic of Italy's Piedmont region, where they are often filled 
with a light ragu of rabbit, veal and pork. Cefalu's enormous agnolotti are 
stuffed with crab and lobster and served in an uppity French-inspired sauce 
Nantua that would be at home in a silver sauce boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigatoni is the foil for salsa puttanesca , a powerful Neapolitan sauce made 
with black olives, capers, fresh tomato and garlic (Cefalu has left out the 
traditional anchovies -- he says this crowd doesn't favor them). Salty, 
imported olives give this dish a powerful tang.  
</P>
<P>
 Mostaccioli arriminati is named for the resort city Rimini. It's an eccentric 
blend of broccoli, pine nuts and raisins, a combination I might find daunting 
were it not overwhelmed by the wonderful house marinara sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 But the most impressive pasta here is easily the gnocchi. When they are good, 
they are very, very good, and when they are bad -- well, you know. "Mine are 
all potato," boasts the chef, and who will argue? They melt in your mouth, as 
does the creamy Gorgonzola sauce on them. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a smattering of non-pasta entrees. Saltimbocca (literally "jump in the 
mouth") consists of thinly pounded veal topped with prosciutto and a thin layer 
of Italian cheese, in this case Fontina. What makes it soar is Cefalu's 
phenomenal brown sauce, which tastes as if the chef stood over it for days 
while it was reducing.  
</P>
<P>
 Eggplant Mangia Mangia, deliciously smoky, is also relatively free of oil, 
baked with good fresh tomatoes and layered with bufala mozzarella. Chicken 
Mangia Mangia, the only chicken dish here, resembles fajitas, but surprise 
ingredients such as ginger, shallots, white wine and asparagus make it far more 
sophisticated. Perhaps the one dish to avoid is braciola , a tired, excessively 
sweet steak rolled around a prosciutto, pine nut and raisin filling. 
</P>
<P>
 The desserts aren't much, apart from the chef's homemade cannoli , filled with 
with sweet cheese, candied cherries and chocolate bits. Pass on the drab, 
slightly tart tirami su , though the colorful store-bought spumoni ice cream is 
properly cold and creamy.  
</P>
<P>
 By the time you finish, the stereo should be playing Pavarotti. And here in 
the suburbs, as far as I'm concerned, that's amore.  
</P>
<P>
 Mangia Mangia is high-end moderate. Antipasti are $4.95 to $7.95. Pastas are 
$7.95 to $12.95. Entrees are $11.95 to $14.95.

TRIED & TRUE: SPEED GOLF IN 18 HOLES? FAST CHANCE; BACK NINE AT BIG CANYON IS 
RAPID-PLAY HEAVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott is a free-lance writer who regularly contributes 
to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The numbers whizzed around in the darkness between my face and the ceiling, 
leering, sticking out their tongues. 60 minutes, 6,400 yards, 18 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour?? How was I going to do it in an hour?  
</P>
<P>
 I tried to sleep, but it was no use. Midnight came, then 2 a.m., then 4, and 
still the numbers razzed me: nearly 6,400 yards -- that's about 3.6 miles -- 
uphill and downhill and through trees and around lakes and sand. Eighteen holes 
in one hour. That's what? About 3.5 minutes per hole? Less? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, less. I'd never make it. Why did I tell everybody I could do it in an 
hour? I mean, I'd have a cart and everything -- I'd be driving the course 
instead of sprinting it with a bag over my shoulder. One hour seemed to be the 
magic time. After all, most weekend foursomes don't get around a regulation 
course in less than four hours. I would be playing alone. The math seemed 
simple. 
</P>
<P>
 But still, there was that matter of getting the ball from the tee to the green 
and into the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 This was something I'd wanted to try for years: a round of what might be 
called speed golf. Playing a regulation course as fast as possible. I'd had it 
worked out, theoretically, for a long time. Tee off before the first group in 
the morning, so no one would get in my way. Drive a nice, juiced-up cart. Get 
to the ball almost before it stops rolling. Set up quickly and hit. Then move 
on and do it again. Beat the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 I decided on Willowick Golf Course in Santa Ana, my local track. I had played 
it dozens of times and knew it well. It was flat, broad, not terribly 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 But I didn't count on darkness. Sure, said course manager Chris Donovan, I was 
welcome to try it. But to be first on the course I'd have to tee off about 
5:20, in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get some real fanatics out here who like to start that early and still get 
to work on time," Donovan explained. She suggested that if I wanted the luxury 
of daylight I might want to try to talk someone at a less busy, private course 
into the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 I called my friend Joe De Franco, a founding member of Big Canyon Country Club 
in Newport Beach. He agreed to intercede on my behalf with the head pro, Bob 
Lovejoy, who called back within the hour and agreed, if I could do it the next 
morning, Saturday, at 6:30. 
</P>
<P>
 I arrived, bleary and yawning, at 6. There would be no practicing on the 
driving range. Still too dark. Affable assistant pro Dennis McGavack arrived 
about 10 minutes later, opened the starter's shack and gave me a few 
navigational tips, most of which I was too sleepy to hear. Photographer Henry 
DiRocco showed up shortly after to ride with me for the first nine holes and 
record the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, still in half darkness, Henry and I drove out in a comfortable but 
less-than-supersonic cart to the first tee (after taking a wrong turn) and, at 
exactly 6:30 by my watch, I stroked an anemic pop fly into the gloom. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Henry nor I saw it fly or land, but I guessed it was on the left side 
of the fairway. I rammed the driver back in the bag, dived for the cart and 
gunned off after it. It was indeed where I thought it would be, but I ruined 
the good luck by dashing up to the ball, setting up in about .00006 seconds and 
punching the ball on a low line drive across the fairway far short of the 
green. 
</P>
<P>
 I swore for the first of dozens of times that morning and sped off after it, 
down a short little hill. I applied the brakes at the bottom, near where the 
ball came to rest . . . and nearly ended the day with Henry and me in the 
hospital. The brakes locked and, NASCAR-like, the cart spun on the dewy rough a 
full 180 degrees and slid down the rest of the hill backward. I sat, pop-eyed, 
clutching the wheel. Henry hugged his cameras and stared at me as if I had just 
taken a swing at him with a 5-iron. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The next eight holes didn't get much better. I never spun the cart out again, 
but after the first three holes I was 15 minutes into the round, and I found 
myself panting while standing over putts -- far from ideal. Nearly every second 
out of the cart was spent at a trot. The combination of fatigue and my frantic 
state of mind ("Faster, faster, you're behind!") made for truly chaotic golf. 
Few shots went where I wanted them to. Putts skittered around the green like 
water bugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry dove out of the cart at the clubhouse turn, pleading another assignment, 
and I accelerated off for the back nine -- in the wrong direction. McGavack 
darted out of the starter's shack and rescued me. 
</P>
<P>
 But he couldn't save my elapsed time: 59 minutes and change. Front nine score: 
57. 
</P>
<P>
 But suddenly the evil golf gods took a coffee break . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Fatalism is a wonderful quality in a golfer, and it suddenly kicked in with a 
will. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," I thought to myself, "You've already made a hash of it. Why not change 
your tactics and think of the back nine as an experiment? Slow down. Be 
deliberate. Don't rush. Don't run. Analyze. Strategize. Take an extra few 
seconds at the address and hit it cleanly." 
</P>
<P>
 I stepped up the the ball on the 10th tee, waggled comfortably into place . . 
. and clouted the ball straight down the middle. A long, long way out there. I 
grinned like a fool, watching as it arced gracefully into the dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Two holes later, I had given up rushing around, I had stopped sweating, and, a 
few minutes later, I canned my first par of the round on the par-3, 176-yard 
15th hole after hitting a dead straight shot to the green and into a flock of 
feeding ducks, who turned and scowled. 
</P>
<P>
 It began to be fun. Really fun. Weekend golfers are fond of complaining about 
slow play, and here I was in rapid-play heaven, and I was scoring acceptably on 
one of the loveliest courses I'd ever seen. I bogeyed all the rest of the holes 
save one, which is pretty usual for my standard of play. It was wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
 When I finally put my putter in the bag after finishing 18, I looked at my 
watch and found that I had finished the full round in -- almost to the tick -- 
one hour and 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Elapsed time on the back nine: 45 minutes. Back-nine score: 48. 
</P>
<P>
 Total time: 105 minutes. Total score: 105. Who says golf isn't poetic? 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the clubhouse, the traditional excuses started almost immediately, as 
De Franco and I puffed on cigars. With faultless golfing logic, I decided that:

NEWS ANALYSIS; QUAKE BRINGS IMMIGRATION ISSUE TO NATIONAL FOREFRONT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The seismic aftershocks of the Northridge quake may be subsiding, but intense 
political temblors are radiating from California to Washington over providing 
rent and other long-term disaster assistance to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast urban destruction of the Jan. 17 quake -- and the images of many 
poor, Latino victims marooned in shelters and waiting in lines for government 
aid -- has given a new face and force to the debate over U.S. taxpayers' 
obligation to provide public funds to those living here illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this crisis will crystallize the issue for two reasons," said Rep. 
Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles). "This catastrophe was played out on a national 
stage, not just a California stage. Everybody saw the damage and takes an 
interest in that. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we have the (state elected leaders) legitimately coming back and asking 
for full funding for benefits (for illegal immigrants) they must provide by 
law. Those two things make a lawmaker from Nebraska start tuning in." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one of this disaster's lasting legacies may be that it lifted 
California's bitter internal political conflicts over treatment of undocumented 
residents to the national dais. 
</P>
<P>
 In the months before the quake, Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, citing state 
budget problems, urged a cutoff of health and education benefits for 
California's illegal immigrants, estimated by the Census Bureau to total about 
1.3 million statewide. The state's two Democratic U.S. Senators, Dianne 
Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, also issued calls to greatly increase border 
security to curb illegal immigration. Latino lawmakers and civil rights 
advocates have condemned the proposals as immigrant bashing. 
</P>
<P>
 Against that backdrop, and with the intense national media coverage of the 
quake and the costly recovery efforts, President Clinton's record $8.6-billion 
earthquake aid package offered an opportune vehicle for those seeking to limit 
assistance to undocumented residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure from California Republicans, but with the support of Democrats 
such as Dixon who are feeling constituent pressure on both sides of the issue, 
the earthquake aid package was amended in the powerful Appropriations Committee 
on Tuesday to deny non-emergency relief benefits to those known to be illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The provision does not require disaster relief workers to ask which applicants 
are living here legally. And, in a compromise worked out by Democrats, the bill 
specifically permits emergency food, shelter and medical treatment to be 
offered to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Many, like Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina, say the victory is 
more symbolic than real. Practical problems in enforcing the restriction are 
significant and many forms of aid, such as quake-related Small Business 
Administration loans, are not available to illegal immigrants anyway, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the number of illegal immigrants lining up for quake aid is unknown. 
Immigration rights specialists say many Latinos seeking assistance are legal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if the provision is approved -- and some lawmakers say efforts to 
further restrict quake aid for undocumented residents are still possible in 
Congress -- it will be a major departure from past disaster relief packages, 
which were not tied to applicants' legal status. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say leaders of the effort to curtail access to government programs 
took political advantage of a climate ripe for immigrant bashing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bad economy is feeding it and the horrendous crime that exists in our 
communities," said Rep. Matthew G. Martinez (D-Monterey Park), who criticizes 
the aid restriction for being immoral and fostering a "condition for 
discrimination" against all Latinos. "It only manifests a sentiment that 
already was there and already growing." 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters of the restriction, including some Democrats, said the quake 
bill provided a breakthrough in the debate over illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first shot over the bow," said Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside), 
who authored the provision restricting the quake aid. "It establishes the 
principle (that) taxpayer money should not go to make illegal aliens whole on 
the same basis we make United States citizens whole." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), an advocate of other measures to 
limit illegal immigration, said he argued to his party's leadership that they 
should seize the initiative on limiting quake aid to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the taxpayers of this country should be asked to pay for two 
months or more rent, or to replace the cost of furniture and clothing that may 
have been lost by people who have knowingly broken our laws," said the 
congressman, who said he has fielded many such complaints from constituents in 
his quake-damaged San Fernando Valley district. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberal Democrats like Dixon and Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) worked 
together to broker a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping we will dodge this issue (for now)," Dixon said. "We need money 
and don't want to hold it up on a major national policy debate." But even Dixon 
says "there is a legitimate debate when you talk about long-term kinds of 
federal support" for quake victims who are illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Democrats are being forced to endorse restrictions on quake aid 
shows the issue is gaining momentum, some analysts say. "It is a clear clue . . 
. this issue has lots of resonance. It's not just an ideological issue," said 
William Schneider, of the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be harder to explain to your constituents why you supported aid to 
illegal immigrants than why you opposed it. And (elected officials) always do 
what's easier to explain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though critics contend the quake aid restriction would have little if any 
practical effect on the current relief efforts, they are concerned about where 
such legislative efforts may lead next. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extremely dangerous," said David Hayes-Bautista, a professor at the UCLA 
School of Medicine who studies public policy issues affecting Latinos. "It is 
setting up a wedge (and) racializing policy in a very nasty way."

NO EVIDENCE OF 'SUGAR HIGH' IN CHILDREN FOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The myth of the "sugar high" may finally be laid to rest by a comprehensive 
new study that concludes that consuming large quantities of sugar does not make 
children hyperactive, experts said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Many scientists have long believed that sugar-laced foods pose no threat to 
children other than tooth decay and obesity, but the new study, published today 
in the New England Journal of Medicine "should have a great impact with the 
general public," said Dr. Joseph Biederman of Massachusetts General Hospital in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 In the study, researchers prepared all food eaten by 48 children and their 
families for nine weeks and carefully observed their behavior. "There is no 
evidence sugar has an adverse effect on children's behavior," said Dr. Mark L. 
Wolraich of Vanderbilt University, who directed the research. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every well-controlled study has now shown that there is no link between sugar 
and behavior," said Dr. Judith Rapoport of the National Institute of Mental 
Health. "This is absolutely a dead issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea that sugar causes hyperactivity is the second widely accepted myth 
about the disorder to be discredited in recent years. During the 1980s, similar 
research disproved the belief that food additives and coloring agents, such as 
red dye, caused hyperactivity. That notion had caused many parents to adopt the 
so-called Feingold diet, in which the additives were rigorously excluded from 
children's diets. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many insisted that the diet was effective, most researchers now 
believe that the perceived benefits were really a result of the increased 
parental attention necessary to keep the children on the diet. 
</P>
<P>
 The links to sugar and dyes, Rapoport said, "have nothing to do with real 
data, but a lot to do with people's frustration and needing answers and better 
treatment that are not yet forthcoming." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the elimination of sugar and food additives leaves the world without 
a pop-culture explanation of hyperactivity, researchers believe they are making 
progress in identifying its causes. Scientists are zeroing in on a gene that 
seems to be associated with the disorder, and others have identified subtle 
brain differences that may contribute to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyperactivity, more properly known as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
or ADHD, is the most common psychiatric diagnosis in American children, 
affecting as many as 9%. Its major symptoms include a short attention span, 
difficulty with or inability to finish projects, a low tolerance for 
frustration and inability to get along with other children and adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians had thought that most children outgrew the condition, but new 
evidence suggests that it can be a lifelong problem that is manifested as drug 
abuse, frequent job changes and even criminal behavior among adults. By some 
estimates, as many as 15 million adult Americans suffer from the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common treatment for children and teen-agers involves the central 
nervous system stimulant Ritalin, which -- paradoxically -- seems to calm 
children and enable them to focus on tasks. Many critics argue that Ritalin is 
overprescribed; recent surveys have shown that it is taken by about 3.6% of 
elementary school children and 1.5% of those in middle school and junior high. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolraich's study involved 25 children ages 3 to 5, and 23 children ages 6 to 
10. The older group had all been identified by their parents as being sensitive 
to sugar. Psychiatric screening identified nearly a third as having attention 
deficit disorder or a related disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of the study, dietitians went into each of the homes and 
removed all food. They provided the family with precooked meals and all the 
other food they needed each week, including snacks, food for guests and even 
food for parties at school. The families spent three weeks on each of three 
diets -- one containing sugar, one containing the artificial sweetener 
aspartame (better known as Nutrasweet) and one containing saccharin. Neither 
the families nor the researchers knew which diets they were receiving. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents, teachers and baby-sitters all provided careful evaluations of the 
children's activities each week. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line, Wolraich said, was that the older children's behavior did not 
change, no matter what diet they were eating. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the younger children, small differences turned up in three of 31 
measurements. In one of these, the parents' ratings of their children's school 
performance, behavior actually improved when they were on the sugar diets. The 
two other measurements showed that the youngsters moved more slowly on a 
pegboard test when they were eating sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 Those results suggest that sugar does not trigger hyperactivity and in some 
cases might actually have a calming effect, but the effect was very small, 
Wolraich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts noted that sugar can provide an energy boost, but that does not 
normally produce a behavioral change. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolraich concedes that his results may not convince everyone. "With some 
parents, it's a belief and no matter what we say they are not likely to make a 
change. The best we can do is provide a good quality study and make them aware 
of it, and then let them make their own decision."

NEWS ANALYSIS; PARAMOUNT COULD PROVE BARGAIN IN RIGHT HANDS; ACQUISITIONS: KEY 
IS EXPLOITING ENTERTAINMENT ASSETS IN ERA OF NEW TECHNOLOGY. TED TURNER IS 
MODEL OF SUCCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES and KATHRYN HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the late 1980s, Hollywood and Wall Street labeled cable mogul Ted Turner a 
fool who had overpaid for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's library of films that included 
such classics as "The Wizard of Oz" and "Gone With the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
 Today Turner is widely regarded as a visionary, after using the $1.2-billion 
deal as a linchpin to build lucrative cable channels that generate hundreds of 
millions of dollars a year. Some even consider the MGM library a steal. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be helpful to keep that in mind as the frenetic $10-billion bidding war 
for Paramount Communications lurches toward a climax over the next 11 days, 
amid criticism that rival suitors QVC Network and Viacom Inc. are offering too 
much. Observers say Paramount may look like a Blue Light Special within five 
years, if the victor skillfully exploits the company's movie, publishing, TV 
and sports assets in the technological new world. 
</P>
<P>
 With the ballyhooed information superhighway taking shape amid promises that 
TV viewers will have access to hundreds of channels, the demand for movies and 
TV programs is expected to grow exponentially -- making vast film libraries 
such as Paramount's even more valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say, yes, they are overpaying today," said one top Hollywood executive 
who asked not to be named. "But my gut tells me I'll be saying 'no' tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount's board is expected to meet Friday to assess the final bids and make 
a recommendation to shareholders. But based on Wall Street's reaction 
Wednesday, Viacom will be the victor. "The market has spoken," said one major 
investor. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also rumors Wednesday that BellSouth Corp. will try to boost QVC's 
stock price -- and thus the value of its bid -- by buying QVC stock on the open 
market. BellSouth, QVC's main financial backer in the Paramount bidding, had no 
immediate comment, but two Wall Street sources said they believed the regional 
phone company would have to obtain a federal judge's permission before making 
such a move -- unlikely to happen before Feb. 14 -- when Paramount shareholders 
must pledge their shares to either Viacom or QVC. 
</P>
<P>
 As the bidding has dragged on over five months, shareholders have learned that 
putting a price tag on any company these days is nearly impossible, with the 
technology revolution driving values into outer space. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend began 20 years ago, when the proliferation of home videocassette 
recorders, specialty cable channels and foreign TV channels began to add 
billions of dollars to the value of films that otherwise would have gathered 
dust after their box office and broadcast TV runs. 
</P>
<P>
 A film such as Walt Disney's 1940 animated classic "Pinocchio" used to sit in 
a vault, trotted out every five to seven years to play again in theaters. But 
Disney has reaped about $125 million in revenue selling "Pinocchio" 
videocassettes over the past 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Other recent studio deals -- such as Japanese manufacturing giant Matsushita's 
$6.6-billion purchase of MCA Inc. in 1990 -- also look like bargains now. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts estimate that the New York-based company's current value is $8 
billion to $9 billion. Its biggest asset, Paramount Pictures studio, is said to 
be worth $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion, and Paramount's 50% share of the USA 
cable network is valued at $450 million to $600 million. Its huge Paramount 
Publishing unit is put in the neighborhood of $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many of those estimates are based on the current rather than potential 
value, with the key factor being the amount of cash the company generates. Most 
often, a multiple of that cash flow is used to make overall value estimates, 
often using previous sales as a guide. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimates also vary widely on specific assets. Seidler Cos. analyst Jeffrey 
Logsdon, for instance, values Paramount's five theme parks at $500 million. 
Some other analysts value the parks slightly higher, at nearly $550 million, 
but some entertainment executives believe they are worth less than $500 million 
because most are in areas with harsh climates. 
</P>
<P>
 But those estimates pale next to the $750-million value placed on the parks by 
Viacom and its proposed merger partner, Blockbuster Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Valuing entertainment assets is also tricky because no one knows how much 
revenue a slate of films and television shows will generate. That was clear on 
Wednesday, when Paramount disclosed that it will lose from $35 million to $40 
million in the financial quarter ended Jan. 31, in part because its holiday 
films failed to deliver as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The company cited "Addams Family Values," a sequel Paramount had counted on to 
be a hit but that will result in an "unexpected write-down." In addition, the 
company said it lost $18 million on its 50% share in the USA Network, blamed 
largely on the unexpectedly dismal ratings for the syndication debut of "Major 
Dad." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, some assets may prove more valuable than expected. Paramount's 
Star Trek franchise, worth little in the 1970s, was resuscitated by a hit 
feature film in 1979, resulting in a successful string of sequels and 
merchandise sales that have brought the studio more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Paramount is making sure the franchise lives long and prospers by passing 
the baton to a younger cast in "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and "Star Trek: 
Deep Space Nine." Yet another spinoff, "Star Trek: Voyager," is planned. A 
"Next Generation" feature film is in the works, which, if successful, could 
result in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue from sequels, the sale of 
Star Trek toys and the development of video games. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Paramount's value also hinges on who ends up at the helm. Most 
observers give Viacom the edge in assets -- such as its Showtime and MTV 
networks and its successful television syndication business. But they give the 
nod to QVC Chairman Barry Diller when it comes to the vision and creativity 
needed to take advantage of new technologies. "It's worth something to one 
person, and something else to another. It's worth what you can make of it," 
said one studio chief. 
</P>
<P>
 To calculate the value of the competing Paramount bids, Wall Street is trying 
to forecast the price of Viacom or QVC stock immediately after a victory in the 
Paramount auction. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Viacom increased the value of the securities it is offering for 
49.9% of Paramount shares (cash would be used to buy the remainder) and 
improved the terms of the partial guarantee it is offering in the event Viacom 
stock trades lower than expected a year or two after the merger. 
</P>
<P>
 QVC, for its part, reconfigured its bid to boost its cash component by $750 
million but did not effectively increase its overall value. For that reason, 
Wall Street arbitrager Curtis Schenker said, "I can't imagine that the board is 
not going to endorse Viacom." 
</P>
<P>
 Schenker, the managing partner of Scoggin Capital Management, added: "To us it 
is very clear that Viacom is a superior bid . . . having protection on the back 
end is very important." 
</P>
<P>
 S. G. Warburg analyst Lisbeth Barron calculated that the bids are worth $82 to 
$83 a share, or about $10.1 billion to $10.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 On a daily stock price basis, however, the value of the bids reflects a 
greater disparity because the perceived winner's stock declines, due to the 
impact of absorbing a new company and assuming more debt. Based on Wednesday's 
prices, Barron estimated QVC's bid was $87.26 and Viacom's bid was about $84.23 
per share, or $10.3 billion to $10.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount fell $1.875 to $78, while QVC jumped $2 to close at $46.75. Viacom A 
fell $1.125 to $37.875, just above its 52-week low of $37.125, while Viacom B 
fell 62.5 cents to $33.50 -- setting a new 52-week low. Blockbuster fell 75 
cents to close at $26.875; BellSouth declined 75 cents to $59.

HUNDREDS GET UNREQUESTED QUAKE FUNDS FROM FEMA; AID: HOUSING CHECKS OF UP TO 
$3,450 GO TO PEOPLE WHOSE HOMES ARE LIVABLE. AGENCY SAYS ERRORS COME IN RUSH TO 
HELP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of government checks have been mailed to people living in areas hit 
hard by the Northridge earthquake -- even though some of the recipients say 
they never asked for the emergency funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the checks, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency for up 
to $3,450 apiece, seem to be intended for emergency housing needs, although 
some people receiving them say their homes are still habitable. Others say that 
when they called FEMA to ask about the checks, they were told the money could 
be used for any earthquake-related costs. But the checks also come with a 
warning that people who cash them are subject to audits and should keep 
detailed records and receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA officials conceded Wednesday that there were problems in the assistance 
program but said they stemmed from the effort to get aid to victims as quickly 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that about 21,000 emergency housing checks totaling about $67 
million had been issued to date and only a small percentage -- perhaps 2% -- 
went to those who had not asked for them. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency used city maps of areas most heavily damaged to identify priorities 
in the assistance program. But officials urged patience and said all earthquake 
victims who qualify for aid will get it. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of the unrequested checks are cropping up all over the region, from 
Simi Valley to Northridge to the Westside, with some people reporting whole 
blocks of neighbors receiving them. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the government's unexpected largess has only added to the overall 
confusion of recovery efforts. They don't know whether the checks are grants or 
loans or whether they can be applied to any bona fide earthquake repair, and 
are unsure where to return them. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the checks also raise the question of whether the government, 
criticized for its lax response during past disasters, may have overcompensated 
this time and whether irregularities in the assistance program, if there are 
any, will be reconciled. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those contacted said the checks arrived after they had called a hot 
line set up by FEMA to handle the flood of aid applications and inquiries from 
earthquake victims. Normally, FEMA requires that the homes of applicants for 
emergency assistance be inspected to determine the extent of damage before 
checks are released. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this case, check recipients say, no one checked to make sure they were 
eligible and the money turned up out of the blue. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who received the unanticipated checks, meanwhile, voiced both concern 
and indifference. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just one more thing to deal with, as if you didn't have enough to do 
already," laughed one woman, an employee in the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office. She said her Westside home needs some structural repairs but 
was not seriously damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 She called the FEMA hot line a few days after the Jan. 17 quake to ask about 
non-emergency loans she might qualify for. She was asked specifically whether 
she needed emergency aid and said no. 
</P>
<P>
 However, last weekend the woman received a check for $3,450 for emergency 
housing. She said no one has come to inspect her house to verify that there is 
any damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's commendable that the government is responding so quickly but I 
don't know if they are allocating money properly, certainly not in my case." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman said she was particularly concerned that some money being hastily 
dispensed may not be getting to people who truly need it. Her sister, for 
example, lived in a Sherman Oaks apartment building that was leveled but has 
been able to get only $500 in emergency aid, so far, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Northridge resident said he called the hot line shortly after the quake to 
inquire about a Small Business Administration loan and this week received a 
$3,450 check for emergency housing. 
</P>
<P>
 A notice accompanying the check reads: "This is in response to your 
application for FEMA disaster housing assistance. Because your application 
indicates that your home was damaged or destroyed during the earthquake you are 
being provided FEMA assistance. By cashing the enclosed check you are 
confirming that the information on your application is true and correct. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "I called the hot line again and asked what this (check) was for and the guy 
looked up my control number and said I was entitled to it," said the man, who 
added his house had suffered damage -- a fallen chimney and a damaged roof -- 
but was still habitable. "There was no screening or any processing of 
information other than what I had given them over the phone. I'd like to ask 
them what are the auditing procedures and when do I have to supply them with 
these receipts." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrie Goodman, FEMA's director of public affairs, said he was sensitive to 
such concerns but said his organization was doing its best under the 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know this is an agency where you're damned if you do and damned if you 
don't," Goodman said. "The system is not infallible because it was put into 
place virtually overnight. There are things to work out and we are working at 
them furiously. But the bottom line is we are getting aid to people -- the vast 
majority to people who need it desperately." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Kishton, FEMA's coordinating officer for the earthquake, added that 
eventually the homes of all people who receive checks will be inspected and the 
agency has instituted auditing procedures to ensure against fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those who received unrequested checks were more understanding of the 
early hitches than others. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think we're eligible and would like to return the check," said one 
woman, a Simi Valley resident who received a $3,300 emergency housing check. 
The woman estimates that her home suffered about $20,000 in damage but it is 
mostly cosmetic and the house is still being lived in. 
</P>
<P>
 "But with all the criticism we've heard and read about FEMA and government 
agencies taking so long to respond, the one thing you have to say is they 
certainly acted quickly in this case. Maybe they feel it is more important to 
get the money out there right away for people and to reconcile things later. 
Actually, it made me feel pretty good about the government."

COLUMN ONE; DANCING AWAY FROM TROUBLE; SOME YOUTHS HAVE LEFT GANGS IN FAVOR OF 
CLUBS DEVOTED TO BANDA MUSIC. THEIR PARTIES CAN SPARK PROBLEMS, POLICE SAY, BUT 
THE CRAZE IS VIEWED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO VIOLENCE. 
</P>

<P>
 Four beefy guys with ponytails and tattoos strut through the crowd at a 
South-Central Los Angeles party. 
</P>
<P>
 They confront three other guys wearing baseball caps airbrushed with words 
such as machos and maldito. Without speaking, each side flashes signs -- 
indicating who they are and where they're from. Speaking with their hands, they 
twist their fingers and rapidly open and close their fists -- often a signal 
that a gang fight is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 But these youths are throwing club signs, symbolizing their allegiance to the 
quebradita dance clubs for which they have abandoned their gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 The clubs, whose members are united by a passion for dancing to Mexican banda 
music, have helped steer youths from gangs and have the potential for keeping 
more off the streets, say police, school officials and former gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I've seen is something unreal," said Jose Vargas, a Santa Ana police 
officer. "I went to one of the parties and I was amazed to see about 300 kids 
between the ages of 8 and 30, all dressed up in the cowboy clothes and dancing. 
By God, if we could get all the kids in Santa Ana in clubs, dancing like this, 
we could stop all the shootings on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 30,000 Latinos are fueling the quebradita club craze, which has 
swept Southern California and is quickly gaining popularity across the country 
and in Mexico, according to KLAX-FM (97.9), a radio station that registers the 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the first group was organized in Huntington Park in 1990, more than 800 
have formed -- attracting both former and present gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 With names such as Sheriff de Chocolate , Super Bandido and Los Tres 
Mosqueteros , the clubs operate like dance fraternities. Every weekend, members 
of different clubs meet one another at a network of parties held at homes, 
halls and warehouses across Los Angeles and Orange counties. Most party-goers 
are 10 to 25 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows how many youths have left gangs for quebradita clubs, and no one 
sees the clubs as a cure-all for the gang problem. But officials say many 
youths have either given up gangbanging or are less active because of their 
club involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see a lot of gang members I deal with now wearing the cowboy boots," said 
Manuel Velasquez, a San Fernando Valley crisis intervention worker for 
Community Youth and Gang Services. "When they see me, they get embarrassed and 
say, 'Don't say anything to anyone.' I say to them, 'No, that's cool.' We 
encourage kids to join the clubs because it provides them with another 
alternative to gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 Sergio Castellanos, an 18-year-old former Pacoima gang president, saw his 
older brother shot to death during a gang fight. Now he spends weekends dressed 
in cowboy boots and black button-fly jeans, dancing to banda music at parties 
across Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been shot in the chest and leg, and I've lost a lot of friends to gang 
fights," said Castellanos, who is president of the club Orgullo Maldito. "So 
when I moved to Huntington Park, I didn't want to be in anything gang-related. 
Instead of being out on the streets killing people, a lot of gang members are 
now in clubs having fun, meeting people and dancing." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Vargas and others say the creation of quebradita clubs is a "great 
thing to happen in the (Latino) community," they also have sparked controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say they sometimes have to break up parties because of fights, loud 
music and rowdiness. Sometimes, alcohol shows up, but most clubs say they do 
not promote drinking and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say members routinely break the law when they throw parties at homes 
and charge guests $2 to $10 to get in. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that club members wear tight jeans instead of baggy 
gangster-style clothes, they are frequently mistaken for gang members because 
they hang out in groups, flash hand signs and wear matching clothes emblazoned 
with their club names. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a little apprehensive about them because the clubs are not all 
positive," said Raul Moreno, principal of South Gate High School. "Some of the 
clubs adopt bad names and have the same idiosyncrasies as gangs. Any time you 
get a group of kids together, it can take on positive or negative 
characteristics." 
</P>
<P>
 But for the most part, school officials who are familiar with the clubs 
support them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The clubs don't have the same rivalries that gangs have," said Antonio 
Garcia, principal of Huntington Park High. "They seem to promote having a good 
time, rather than getting into trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 The club phenomenon began in 1990 when 18 Huntington Park youths decided to 
start a fan club for the group Banda Vallarta Show. Calling themselves Te Ves 
Bien Buena, the youths met regularly to dance the quebradita , which combines 
elements of country-Western, polka, lambada and flamenco-style dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Banda fans in other areas soon decided to start their own groups, using names 
of their favorite banda songs and performers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It caught on in different neighborhoods because it wasn't possible for 
someone in Pasadena, for instance, to be part of a club in Huntington Park," 
said Jacobo Rodriguez, director of promotions for Kora Records in Downey, which 
produces and promotes banda music. "So it was suggested that they form their 
own clubs in their own neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the clubs formed, the parties began. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, they were small. Members would gather in someone's living room or 
back yard and spend hours dancing to the festive horns and oom-pah bass 
blasting from a boombox or stereo. 
</P>
<P>
 Bands and deejays have replaced the boomboxes, and parties are held at sites 
large enough to accommodate hundreds of guests. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 people recently crammed into a South-Central tire shop to 
attend a party sponsored by one of Los Angeles' oldest and largest clubs, 
Casimira, which has more than 150 members. As two bands played in the 
smoke-filled warehouse, people rocked to the distinct banda beat. 
</P>
<P>
 No fights broke out and alcohol was restricted to those over 21. Only a few 
adults walked around with beer cans. Two security guards patrolled the area, 
and every person who paid the $5 admission fee was frisked at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all get along well with the other clubs," said Rick Ruiz, a member of the 
Ritmo Vaquero club, which has 75 members throughout Los Angeles County. "We 
don't get into fights because we all just want to have fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Members adhere to special customs and speak a language that few others 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, there's "baptizing." To complete this ritual, which symbolizes 
solidarity between two groups, members of one club will go to a party and pour 
champagne on another club's members. 
</P>
<P>
 While at parties, revelers also will shout their club names during breaks in 
the music, and gather in circles and toss one of their comrades into the air. 
After doing a couple of flips waving a club baseball cap, the high flier is 
caught in a basket of arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in suede charro boots, a silk shirt and a black cowboy hat, Ricardo 
Contreras, 18, spent most of a recent night dancing the quebradita -- which 
means "little break" -- to banda renditions of such songs as "Proud Mary" and 
"Deep in the Heart of Texas." 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be a tagger and would write stuff all over the walls and on the MTA 
buses," said Contreras, a Bell High graduate and member of Casimira . "I used 
to make fun of people who liked banda music. But then I went to one party, saw 
all the pretty girls, and then went out and bought myself the boots and the 
hat." 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras said he also used to go to so-called rave parties, where alternative 
music is played. They are held in abandoned buildings and often involve drugs 
and alcohol. He stopped after he became part of the quebradita club scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got bored of the raves, and I'd rather do this because it's not worth it 
getting into trouble all the time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The roots of banda music, once considered mostly a blue-collar phenomenon, go 
back to brass bands brought to Mexico by the 19th-Century immigration of 
Germans. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, many Latino youths -- particularly those who were born in the 
United States -- used to balk at banda music, dismissing it as a kind of 
hillbilly music. Now, young people are banda's biggest fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Club members, some of whom once shunned their Mexican culture, say banda music 
and quebradita dancing make them feel proud of their heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Former gang member Castellanos has seen how banda music and quebradita clubs 
turn young people around. Not only are he and his friends more culturally 
aware, he said, but they are avoiding deadly confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better to be out partying because at least that way you can stay alive," 
said Castellanos, who strictly enforces his club's exclusion of gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such precautions, the parties can lead to trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "(They) sometimes attract problems because of the large numbers of people who 
go," said a Los Angeles Police Department officer from the Southeast Division 
who requested anonymity. "There also have been fights and shootings, and 
sometimes people who go to the parties block the streets. Basically, they do 
what they want." 
</P>
<P>
 It is illegal in most cities in Southern California to charge admission to a 
party held at a private home, or to have a party at a business unless it is 
properly zoned. Richard Sanchez, Los Angeles' chief building inspector, said he 
did not know if any club members have been cited. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Vargas, the Santa Ana police officer, said many officers are critical of 
club members because they are unfamiliar with the club movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard stories from some members of quebradita groups who say they were 
in a park wearing the hats and dancing when the police came and started taking 
their names down," Vargas said. "They said they were part of a quebradita 
group, and the officers said, 'What the heck is quebradita? ' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are hundreds of clubs, most outside the Latino community know 
nothing about them. When first asked about them, Huntington Park Police Chief 
Frank Sullivan said he was "totally unaware" of the clubs. Fifteen minutes 
later, he called to say that a friend had just given him a rundown on the 
craze. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told me about all the parties and all the kids that are involved," 
Sullivan said. "She got all excited when she started talking about it. One of 
the reasons we may not know about this is because we're always dealing with the 
negatives. We don't always hear about the positive things going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Quebradita clubs still are a predominantly Latino trend because its members 
advertise their parties solely in Spanish, through flyers and on 
Spanish-language KLAX-FM -- which started playing banda music in August, 1992, 
and is L.A.'s highest-rated radio station. 
</P>
<P>
 KLAX, known as La Equis (The X), is credited with fueling the phenomenon by 
publicizing parties and allowing members to visit its Hollywood studios to make 
promotional announcements. Various groups have asked the station's disc jockeys 
to become their padrinos or godfathers -- the highest distinction in the club 
hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We promote the clubs because this is the best way to get kids out of gangs," 
said disc jockey Juan Carlos Hidalgo, whose morning ratings top Howard Stern's. 
"But if we don't like the name of the club, we won't promote it. We don't want 
to support clubs who are into anything negative." 
</P>
<P>
 The rage also prompted Carmen Moran to start La Quebradita, a free weekly 
magazine with a circulation of 50,000. The colorful tabloid, which began in 
July, includes articles about different clubs and membership information. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my husband's idea to start the magazine," said Moran, who works out of 
a small Hollywood office. "He said this is a good way to help young people." 
</P>
<P>
 As a way to counteract the negative perceptions, several clubs are 
participating in charitable projects, using proceeds from their parties. About 
a dozen clubs formed a confederation and recently threw a party to buy toys for 
poor children in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Jan. 17 earthquake, KLAX announced that it was sponsoring a food 
drive. A thousand people, most of them club members, came to the station's 
parking lot with donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents are also getting in on the action, encouraging their children to learn 
the dance, attending parties and sometimes even starting their own clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Irene Hernandez and a group of other Eastside parents started El Sherif de 
Chocolate for their children. Although the parents dance too, most members are 
ages 3 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to do this so our kids won't be out on the streets getting into 
trouble," Hernandez said. "The kids have fun dancing, and the parents like it 
as much as their kids."

U.S. PLANS EFFORT TO STEM ILLEGAL ENTRY AT BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Administration will announce a two-year "border initiative" today to 
reduce illegal immigration, deport illegal immigrants from state jails, step up 
enforcement of employer sanctions, streamline asylum procedures and make it 
easier for 8 million immigrants to become citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will add 400 Border Patrol agents to the 996 now on the border in 
the San Diego area this fiscal year -- 300 of them new and 100 reassigned from 
desk and other support work, Administration officials told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Added resources and technology, ranging from improved sensors and mobile 
infrared scopes to new lighting and fencing, will be targeted on the two areas 
where 65% of illegal entries take place -- San Diego and El Paso. Too often in 
the past, additional agents and equipment were "sprinkled" along the entire 
U.S.-Mexico border, an official said. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of fiscal 1995, a total of 1,010 new and reassigned agents will be 
added to San Diego and El Paso, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Focusing on limited stretches of the border is in line with a recommendation 
of a study done for the Immigration and Naturalization Service during the last 
year of the George Bush Administration. The study concluded that concentrating 
resources on a relatively limited section of the border could have a high 
payoff in reducing illegal entries. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, officials said, the fiscal 1995 budget will include funds 
for encouraging permanent resident immigrants to become citizens, an effort 
that INS Commissioner Doris Meissner has made a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 About $30 million will be budgeted for the citizenship drive in fiscal 1995, 
aimed largely at the 5 million legal residents who came to the United States 
since 1965 and another 3 million -- 70% of them from Mexico -- many of whom 
came illegally but have received amnesty and will become eligible for 
citizenship this year through 1996, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The move to increase enforcement of the law against knowingly hiring illegal 
immigrants will include an improved verification procedure for employers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 400 additional agents on the border fell short of the need cited by four 
Southern California congressmen. Republicans Duncan Hunter of El Cajon, Carlos 
J. Moorhead of Glendale and Randy (Duke) Cunningham of San Diego and Democrat 
Lynn Schenk of San Diego said they had been assured by managers of last year's 
Justice Department appropriation that the bill would permit the placement of 
600 agents. They urged Atty. Gen. Janet Reno in a Jan. 24 letter to add the 
full 600. 
</P>
<P>
 "After years of fighting for adequate funding and a substantive increase in 
agents, we are unwilling to accept a lesser number," they wrote. "We are 
counting on the new agents to help us abate the crisis along the border and ask 
that you hire the full amount appropriated." 
</P>
<P>
 Reno, however, decided that it would be better to transfer 100 agents, now 
performing clerical and other support work, to border assignments and to hire 
only 300 new agents, Administration officials said. The agents transferred from 
support work can be replaced with less costly new hires. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who has urged that a larger number of new 
agents be hired for the border and who will take part in today's announcement, 
said the initiative is the best package that could be obtained. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attorney general wants to reorganize, wants to use manpower differently, 
wants to have them adequately trained and equipped," Feinstein said. "She is 
prepared to make a major commitment to the Southwest border and San Diego. So 
California does, I think, come out very well in this package."

BUSINESS LEADERS REJECT HEALTH PLAN; REFORMS: KEY GROUP OF EXECUTIVES CRITICIZE 
CLINTON PROPOSAL, ENDORSE LESS SWEEPING RIVAL MEASURE. WHITE HOUSE DOWNPLAYS 
MOVE, BUT ANALYSTS SEE A SEVERE BLOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a major setback for President Clinton's health care reform plan, the 
nation's top business leaders Wednesday embraced a rival, less ambitious plan 
that has bipartisan congressional support. 
</P>
<P>
 The move by the influential Business Roundtable, composed of 225 heads of 
America's largest corporations, came despite intense White House pressure on 
the executives to remain neutral. 
</P>
<P>
 In embracing the reform plan of Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) as "the starting 
point" of the health care debate, the business chiefs signaled their intention 
to support decidedly less sweeping reforms than those proposed by the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 The business group contended that the President's plan would place too much 
control over the health care system in the hands of the federal government, 
according to Roundtable Chairman John D. Ong, head of B.F. Goodrich Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, he said, members expressed fear that Clinton's plan could create 
a vast and uncontrollable entitlement program. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ong also said business leaders would like to see some modifications in the 
Cooper plan as well. Cooper, in an interview, readily signaled his willingness 
to work with the Roundtable, conceding that his bill "isn't perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 While many analysts said the Roundtable's endorsement of Cooper's bill by a 
majority of the 65 members present is a blow to the Administration, the White 
House sought to minimize the effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a serious, crippling blow, and it means that the Clinton bill will 
not be enacted in certain key respects: the big alliances, the caps on 
insurance premiums, the global budgets and the employer mandate," said Deborah 
Steelman, a Washington health care industry lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
 But senior Clinton adviser David Gergen said: "I don't think we ever claimed 
that we have strong business support" 
</P>
<P>
 Other Administration officials conceded, however, that they have been 
surprised by the absence of broad business support for the President's plan, 
especially because many large companies -- but not all -- are likely to see 
their health care spending go down if Clinton's plan is enacted. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials dismissed the Roundtable vote as largely an attempt 
by big business to enhance its bargaining leverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Administration officials, as well as their congressional allies, also 
privately blamed the vote on what they called high-handed, behind-the-scenes 
maneuvering by insurance and drug company executives within the Roundtable 
health care task force. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ong disputed that characterization, noting that the group's broad 
membership is not dominated by health care interests, which dislike much of 
Clinton's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 65 Roundtable members who voted Wednesday, only 17 represented health 
insurers, drug-makers or other health care concerns, according to Johanna 
Schneider, a Roundtable spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Roundtable members include the chief executives of companies such as Procter & 
Gamble, Pepsico, United Airlines, IBM, AT&T, DuPont and Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the Roundtable vote, some Administration allies blamed the 
White House for what they regarded as its belated and ultimately ineffective 
effort to derail growing support for the Cooper bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're entering a new period now where every single thing counts," said Sen. 
John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-W. Va.), a staunch Clinton ally. 
</P>
<P>
 White House lobbying of the Business Roundtable intensified after an informal 
poll of the group's 85-member policy committee last month revealed support for 
Cooper's bill by a 3-to-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
 "That really spooked the White House," said one knowledgeable health care 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House's behest, the Roundtable's policy-making body agreed to 
delay a formal vote until after the President's State of the Union message. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, numerous CEOs were invited to White House meetings with senior 
Administration officials and, in some cases, with First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton or the President himself. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement Wednesday night, the White House called the Roundtable vote "a 
mistake," adding: "A more accurate starting point would have been to express 
what they like and what they don't like about the variety of plans and to move 
forward with a constructive dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton will continue to work with the business community on his goal of 
providing all Americans with affordable health care coverage, said Jeff Eller, 
a White House spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President is a lot more concerned about how the process ends rather than 
how it begins," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cooper bill is attractive to many businesses because, unlike Clinton's 
plan, it would not force employers to pay at least 80% of a full-time worker's 
health insurance premiums. Rather, Cooper's bill requires firms to make 
coverage accessible. Individuals would decide whether to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's bill does not contain price controls, while the President's would 
limit the growth of insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's plan would require all firms with fewer than 5,000 employees to join 
regional health alliances; Cooper's plan would require companies to participate 
only if they have fewer than 100 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, Clinton's congressional allies called attention to 
what they perceive to be the Cooper bill's political weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 During a hearing at which Cooper and Rep. Fred Grandy (R-Iowa) were the 
principal defenders of the plan that they co-sponsor, Rep. Henry A. Waxman 
(D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on 
health and the environment, called it an "experiment of social engineering." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the Clinton plan focused much of their criticism on a provision 
of the Cooper plan that would limit the tax deductibility of employer 
contributions to workers' health care coverage -- an element also criticized by 
the Roundtable. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would allow companies to deduct only the cost of the 
lowest-priced plan available through their local health-purchasing cooperative.

 Times staff writer Marlene Cimons contributed to this story. Clinton Versus 
Cooper 
</P>
<P>
 A comparison of the health reform packages proposed by President Clinton and 
by Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.). 
</P>
<P>
 BASIC GOALS 
</P>
<P>
 * Clinton and Cooper: Both claim that their plans follow the theory of 
"managed competition": They seek to give consumers more clout in the 
marketplace by banding them together in large purchasing groups, known as 
alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 COVERAGE 
</P>
<P>
 * Clinton: Plan would make coverage mandatory, primarily by requiring 
employers to provide health coverage for their workers. It advocates that the 
poor get help paying for their share of premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cooper: Bill would make coverage voluntary through group-purchased plans. 
Like Clinton plan, it advocates that the poor get help paying for their share 
of premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 EMPLOYER'S ROLE 
</P>
<P>
 * Clinton: Plan would require that employers pay 80% of the average health 
care premiums for full-time workers and their families, and pro-rated shares 
for part-timers and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cooper: No employer mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 BENEFITS 
</P>
<P>
 * Clinton: Plan spells out the health benefits to which every American would 
be entitled. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cooper: Benefits package would be put together by a commission, similar to 
the one that targeted military-base closures. Congress would be required to 
accept or reject the full benefits package. 
</P>
<P>
 COST CONTAINMENT 
</P>
<P>
 Both plans rely upon increasing competition in the health care market to put 
downward pressure on prices, but they add other features to hold down costs as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clinton: Plan includes limits on health care premiums -- in essence, price 
controls. In the year 2004, it would also require that taxes be paid on 
employee health benefits more generous than those spelled out under the act. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cooper: Bill has no cost controls. It would limit the amount of health 
premium payments that employers may deduct for tax purposes.

PREMIERS OF 2 MUSLIM NATIONS VISIT SARAJEVO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Muslim world's two leading stateswomen braved artillery fire during a 
visit here Wednesday to show solidarity with besieged civilians and appeal to 
fellow world leaders to defend the European ideals that would be destroyed by a 
division of Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Ministers Tansu Ciller of Turkey and Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan were 
whisked through this shattered Bosnian capital in helmets, flak jackets and 
armored vehicles on a five-hour tour that took them from the halls of the 
presidency to the bedsides of wounded children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world seems to have forgotten about the Bosnian people," said Ciller, who 
along with Bhutto appealed for a lifting of the U.N. arms embargo that has 
hobbled the Muslim-led government here in its effort to defend 
Bosnia-Herzegovina against nationalists armed and supported by Serbia and 
Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 Bhutto also said air strikes against rebels besieging civilian communities 
should be "urgently considered" by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and 
the United Nations to break the stranglehold that nationalist forces have on 
Sarajevo and other towns and cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is shocking that this appalling human tragedy is being enacted in the 
heart of a continent which prides itself on its commitment to human rights and 
respect for human dignity," Ciller and Bhutto said in a joint declaration. They 
added, "A sovereign and independent state is being violently dismembered along 
racial lines and genocide perpetrated against a peaceful and enlightened 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 While claiming to be visiting more as sympathetic mothers than as politicians, 
the stateswomen delivered the same message at every stop on their whirlwind 
itinerary: The West has turned its back on the suffering in Bosnia and is 
seeking a quick-fix solution that would reward Serbian rebel aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 Their visit coincides with growing indications from some Western countries 
that they have tired of the costly and dangerous humanitarian mission in 
Bosnia, where 2 million have been made homeless and 250,000 reported killed or 
missing in the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain, France, Spain and Canada have threatened to withdraw their troops 
from the U.N. mission here unless there is a negotiated settlement by spring; 
this has stepped up diplomatic pressure on Bosnia's government to capitulate to 
the attackers' terms for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ciller and Bhutto repeatedly warned against forcing an unjust solution, 
claiming it would encourage nationalist aggression and further shackle what 
they said is the Bosnian people's "just struggle" to protect the country's 
territorial integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed division of Bosnia that has won U.N. and European Union backing 
at Geneva-based peace talks was drafted by Serbian and Croatian rebel leaders. 
It would leave the Sarajevo government in control of heavily damaged and 
isolated enclaves covering about one-third of the country, while the Serbian 
rebels who sparked the war with an armed rebellion in 1992 would be granted 
sovereignty over half of Bosnia and have the right to annex that territory to 
an emerging Greater Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciller and Bhutto arrived on a U.N. flight from the Croatian capital of Zagreb 
amid unusual quiet on a clear day, but they were soon exposed to the daily 
cacophony of booming artillery from the Serb-held high ground surrounding the 
city. None of the shells landed near the visiting entourage. 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Prime Minister 
Haris Silajdzic, the prime ministers toured the children's ward of beleaguered 
Kosevo Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are here less as prime ministers and more as mothers, as daughters, as 
wives, as women, to show solidarity with the suffering people of Bosnia and 
also to draw world attention to this place where so much suffering is taking 
place," Bhutto told journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Both women appeared critical of the international community's current approach 
to the Bosnian crisis, which has been aimed at feeding and caring for civilian 
victims while doing little to stop the fighting. Virtually all of the 
population left in Bosnia is now dependent on humanitarian aid that only 
sporadically makes its way across more than 1,000 miles of meandering 
battlefront. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we go on searching for peace, civilians are being killed," Ciller said 
in an apparent reprimand to Western-mediated peace talks in Geneva that have 
dragged on without result for 18 months. "We need to draw the attention of the 
world one more time to this moral issue. Values are no good unless we defend 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Bhutto suggested that the Geneva talks, scheduled to resume next Thursday, 
have become "simply an excuse to buy time." 
</P>
<P>
 If the international community is not prepared to end the fighting, it should 
at least lift the arms embargo to allow Bosnia to defend itself, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciller described Sarajevo as a bastion of the European ideal of different 
religions, nationalities and cultures living together in peace and exhibiting 
"global" values worthy of the international community's heartfelt support. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciller's participation in the trip, which may have been aimed in part at 
shaming the Islamic world into stronger support for Bosnia, was watched warily 
by the Serbs, who continue to resent Turkey for the Ottoman Empire's 500-year 
occupation of the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 Bhutto may have gained some political capital from the Bosnian visit. Three 
months into her second stint as Pakistan's head of government, she has been 
under unrelenting attack by opposition leader Nawaz Sharif. Himself a former 
prime minister, he accuses her of failing miserably to defend Muslim interests 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharif gained an advantage over Bhutto by coming to Bosnia a month ago himself 
and meeting Muslim families in the war zone whose lives have been devastated by 
the fighting. His trip received lavish exposure in many of Pakistan's media, 
implicitly raising the question of what Bhutto was doing to ease her fellow 
Muslims' sufferings.

VOTES SET ON SPENDING CUTS TO OFFSET QUAKE AID; CONGRESS: HOUSE ACTION 
COMPLICATES EFFORTS TO QUICKLY PASS $8.6-BILLION PACKAGE. THREE FUNDING 
PROPOSALS OFFERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Complicating efforts to quickly pass an $8.6-billion earthquake assistance 
package, the House Democratic leadership reluctantly took steps late Wednesday 
virtually assuring that at least some of the aid will be offset by spending 
cuts in other federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, House leaders set up a showdown on the floor today over three 
different proposals to pay for some or all of the emergency funds for Southern 
California by trimming transportation, community development, defense and other 
programs nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, which sent the relief proposal to Congress, 
supports following the previous practice of waiving pay-as-you-go budget rules 
to add disaster costs to the federal deficit. House Democratic leaders also 
have sought to defeat initiatives backed by most Republicans and some 
Democratic hawks on the deficit to balance the aid with spending reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It endangers the bill dramatically because a large number of members will 
refuse to go along with the unprecedented notion that we cut programs in their 
districts to help us," said Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), whose San 
Fernando Valley district was hit hard by the Northridge quake last month. "We 
have a lot of work to do." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, some Republicans, including Rep. David Dreier of San Dimas, 
maintained that inclusion of a spending reduction provision will enhance the 
bill's prospects by attracting more GOP backing even if it makes the measure 
unacceptable to some Democrats. Advocates of the offset proposals say they 
support earthquake aid but some vow to vote against it without spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The eleventh-hour maneuvering Wednesday took place in the House Rules 
Committee as it determined the scope of debate on the assistance bill that 
would be permitted on the floor. Rep. John T. Myers (R-Ind.) offered an 
amendment specifying $7.5 billion in spending cuts; a coalition of Reps. Jim 
Nussle (R-Iowa), John R. Kasich (R-Ohio), Timothy J. Penny (D-Minn.) and 
Californian Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres) proposed a competing amendment to reduce 
spending by $9.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The bipartisan group increased its figure from $7.1 billion this week after 
the Administration boosted the size of its emergency aid proposal, which also 
contains nearly $1.2 billion in funds for military peacekeeping missions and 
nearly $750 million largely for additional costs of last year's Midwestern 
floods and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaker Tom Foley (D-Wash.) said earlier Wednesday that he expected the Rules 
Committee to permit a single offset amendment to be taken up on the House floor 
but predicted it that would be defeated. Many members expected it to be the 
larger bipartisan amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Democratic strategists huddled late Wednesday afternoon, they were 
uncertain that they had enough votes to defeat that proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, Rep. Vic Fazio (D-West Sacramento), a leader in the House, offered 
a third proposal to trim spending by a more modest $2.5 billion. Fazio said he 
is including a set of cuts that the Clinton Administration had supported last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 In a complex parliamentary maneuver called "king of the hill," the Rules 
Committee agreed to allow consideration of Myers' amendment to cut $7.5 
billion, the bipartisan amendment to cut $9.7 billion and Fazio's 
Democratic-backed amendment to cut $2.5 billion -- in that order. If more than 
one of the measures pass, the last one to do so would take effect and negate 
the others. 
</P>
<P>
 This little-used tactic is considered a last-ditch tool for escaping a tough 
spot. In an election year, it would allow deficit-conscious lawmakers to vote 
for all three budget-cutting amendments -- and thereby achieve the Democratic 
leadership's goal of minimizing the size of the reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 House Democratic Whip David E. Bonior (D-Mich.), a member of the Rules 
Committee, said the approach was chosen to avoid any chance of delaying the 
badly needed relief funds for emergency housing, business and home loans and 
reconstruction of freeways, schools and other public facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 He asserted that the "petty politics" of those seeking to link the aid to 
deficit reduction is "pitting the people in California against people in the 
Midwest and the Northeast." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonior said that the House leadership would attempt to defeat both of the 
first two amendments that impose larger cuts but that, failing to do so, it 
would push for the Fazio alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman said that including offsets could drag out the legislative process by 
leading to prolonged negotiations to reconcile versions of the bill passed by 
the House and Senate. He said it might reduce the final aid figure because some 
lawmakers would try to scale back the assistance in an attempt to lessen the 
offsetting spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman also criticized California Republicans, who he said have failed to 
stand up against imposing offsets for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Republicans should have been "leading the charge to ensure the 
prospects for passing the bill, not undermining the prospects of its passage." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreier, a Rules Committee member who supports the offsets but has pledged to 
back the measure under any circumstances, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I thought for a second that offsets would impose any delay in the process, 
I wouldn't support them," he said. "There is no doubt in my mind that we will 
overwhelmingly pass it. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Gerald B. Solomon of New York, the ranking Republican on the Rules 
Committee, predicted that the House would adopt either or both of two 
GOP-backed spending-cut amendments and would then defeat the proposal to 
nullify them with a smaller reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, there have been increasing demands by deficit hawks for some 
method of financing the cost of disaster relief without adding to the massive 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake aid bill also reflects another one of the most contentious 
political issues on Capitol Hill: illegal immigration. On Tuesday, the House 
Appropriations Committee agreed to a compromise amendment that would prohibit 
longer-term post-quake assistance, including housing, to those known to be 
illegal immigrants.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: POLS SHOULD READ POLLS ON QUAKE RELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Politicians pressured by an approaching election intuitively try to 
psychoanalyze the public and mimic its views. That's the democratic process at 
work if you happen to agree with a particular politician or view. If you don't, 
it's political pandering. 
</P>
<P>
 The rhetoric of crime, illegal immigration and taxes comes to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently in California, the tax issue has become embedded in a larger 
controversy -- earthquake relief and repair -- that temporarily has replaced 
crime, immigration and everything else as topic No. 1 for politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 And it appears that some politicians' analyses of the public psyche may be off 
the mark -- not that any ever would admit to being swayed by public opinion, as 
if this were an intrinsic evil. 
</P>
<P>
 These politicians -- most notably Gov. Pete Wilson, Treasurer Kathleen Brown 
and new state Senate leader Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) -- who prefer bond 
financing over a temporary sales tax increase to pay for the state's share of 
earthquake repair, might want to look at recent polling data. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Times Poll and the Field Poll have found that the public 
overwhelmingly prefers raising the sales tax. That puts voters in sync with 
Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco) and Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), the rebel liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a survey of Los Angeles County residents Jan. 22-23, the Times Poll found 
that 68% of the people favored a quarter-cent, one-year increase in the sales 
tax. Only 29% were opposed. This attitude was bipartisan: A sales tax hike was 
supported by 75% of Democrats, 65% of Republicans and 55% of independents. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of a $2-billion bond issue generated less enthusiasm. It was 
favored by a margin of 54% to 24%, with a substantial number of people, 22%, 
not sure. Republicans were less supportive than Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of increasing the gasoline tax by two to four cents a gallon received 
even less support. It was favored by a margin of only 52% to 42%, with 
Democrats in support, Republicans evenly divided and independents opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Field Poll found similar views in a statewide survey completed Monday. 
Asked their preferred method of raising money for earthquake repair and relief, 
46% of the people said a sales tax, 28% a gas tax and 18% bonds. Of various 
sales tax options, a quarter-cent hike for two years was overwhelmingly 
supported, by a margin of 63% to 34%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I phoned some of the people interviewed by the Times Poll to ask why they 
preferred a sales tax increase. They all had thought it out carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sales tax spreads it around a bit more instead of just hitting the poor 
guy who has to drive a car 100 miles a day," noted Kenneth Jones, 64, a retired 
construction manager in South Pasadena. "And I think we have a lot of bonds out 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 He's right. The state is paying on $13.6 billion in general obligation bonds 
and has an unsold backlog of $5.4 billion. Annual interest alone on these bonds 
is $919 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ned Mitchell, 77, of West Covina, a retired security specialist: "Bonds, 
you end up paying more. The interest is ridiculous. The gas tax is bad enough 
as it is. The sales tax isn't good, but what the hell -- it's the lesser of 
evils." 
</P>
<P>
 California motorists pay gasoline taxes of 36.4 cents on the gallon, basically 
divided between Washington and Sacramento. The sales tax varies from 7 1/4 to 8 
1/2 cents, depending on the county. In Los Angeles, it's 8 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and others who oppose a tax hike argue that with Californians still 
burdened by a deep recession, this is the worst time to raise taxes. Anyway, 
they add, nobody yet knows how much Washington will pay or how much the quake 
ultimately will cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the opportunity in Sacramento for a quick political consensus has 
slipped away. The Legislature is cautiously crawling in many directions. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills), whose district 
includes the quake's epicenter, adamantly opposes a tax increase. What 
Washington doesn't pay, she says, should be financed by suspending prevailing 
wage and environmental review requirements in rebuilding, and by abolishing the 
state Coastal, Energy and Lands commissions, the state architect and state fire 
marshal. 
</P>
<P>
 Observes Hayden: "I think people are disoriented. When reality sinks in, 
they'll set aside ideology and say we have to raise taxes -- not to rebuild it 
the way it was, but to rebuild it a new way which is going to even cost more, 
but is going to be safer." 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere between Boland and Hayden is where most politicians will land, as 
they usually do after a proper psychoanalysis of voters, commonly called their 
own polling.

MARIJUANA FOUND IN ANTI-CRIME LEGISLATOR'S HOME; BURGLARY: ASSEMBLYMAN SAYS 
SMALL AMOUNT DISCOVERED BY INVESTIGATORS WAS NOT HIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblyman Jim Costa, author of a "three strikes and you're out" anti-crime 
bill, said Wednesday that police investigating a burglary at his Fresno 
condominium found a small quantity of marijuana, but that it was not his. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic legislator issued a press announcement reporting that the home 
was burglarized last Thursday while he was working on anti-crime legislation in 
Sacramento. Among other things, thieves took electronic equipment, cuff links, 
a keepsake watch, wine and beer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa said officers investigating the break-in found the marijuana. "I'm not 
sure if it was dropped by the burglars or if this was a politically motivated 
act," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno Police Lt. Roger Enmark said that there were no suspects in the 
burglary and that it was not known who owned the marijuana. He said that 
"residue and two ends of partially smoked marijuana cigarettes" were found in a 
shirt box lid in a bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no way to tell whether the burglars brought it in, it was (Costa's) 
or anybody else's," Enmark said. He said the marijuana investigation would not 
be pursued because of limited police resources and because the fine for 
possession of such a small amount would only be $100. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa, who said the break-in was his fourth burglary, received unwanted 
publicity in 1986 after he and a 19-year-old solicited a police informant for a 
"threesome" act of prostitution. He pleaded no contest, was fined $255 and put 
on probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa said the burglary "reminded me once again how painful it is to be a 
crime victim." 
</P>
<P>
 Costa, along with Assemblyman Bill Jones (R-Fresno), is the author of one of 
several bills that would increase the penalties for repeat felony offenders. 
The bills, with strong public backing, were approved by the Assembly on Monday 
and sent to the Senate.

GROUP ISSUES REFORM PLAN FOR URBAN EDUCATION; CITIES: CHANGES WOULD INCLUDE 
GOVERNMENT-FUNDED PRESCHOOLS AND FULL ACCESS FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leaders of California's urban school districts issued a list of proposed 
education reforms Wednesday ranging from government-funded preschool to an 
overhaul of teacher training and full access to schools for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The unprecedented statement, which represents the urban agenda in school 
reform, was drawn up in a daylong session in Los Angeles attended by about 100 
teachers, administrators, parents and political leaders in the state's large 
urban school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Urban education today is a very tough task for all of us," said Rudy 
Castruita, superintendent of the Santa Ana Unified School District and 
president of the Assn. of California Urban School Districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, made up of 17 districts, represents one-fourth of all California 
public school students in kindergarten through 12th grade. The districts serve 
half the California students living in poverty and half the students who speak 
little or no English. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting Wednesday was part of a growing consensus among education, 
business and political leaders that Californians want their public schools to 
do better and would be willing to pay for improvements if presented with a 
credible strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after voters rejected a ballot initiative that would have provided tax 
dollars for parents to spend on private school tuition, for example, Gov. Pete 
Wilson arranged for the head of a nationwide school policy advisory group, the 
Education Commission of the States, to help come up with a plan for improving 
public education. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this month, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) will convene 
a statewide education summit to evaluate public schools and propose solutions 
to their myriad problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The urban schools group will take the agenda fashioned Wednesday to the 
summit, to be held Feb. 15-16 in San Francisco. Castruita said he also expects 
the urban schools' proposals to provide a framework for other measures over the 
next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this, the Legislature can see for the first time what urban educators 
agree on that needs to be done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the proposals are costly, including bringing the amount California 
spends per child up to at least the national average, providing preschool for 
4-year-olds and giving teachers more time for planning, consulting with 
colleagues and updating their skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the reforms -- such as eliminating most state and federal laws and 
regulations that apply to public schools and exacting stiffer penalties for 
crimes committed near schools -- require approval by the Legislature or 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Others promise to be highly controversial, including revamping the process for 
collective bargaining by teachers and ensuring that immigrant children and 
their families have full access to public education and get additional help 
with English lessons and preparation for citizenship.

REINCARNATED ON RADIO; JERRY BROWN IS DOING WHAT COMES NATURALLY IN HIS NEW 
SHOW: TALKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Jerry Brown is living proof of reincarnation. This time, the onetime seminary 
student, California governor and perennial candidate has been reborn as a radio 
talk show host. 
</P>
<P>
 For the brilliant, if distant, philosopher-politician, it is the perfect job. 
All he has to do is talk and, once in a while, give out a toll-free number. 
</P>
<P>
 Bearing his message that special-interest money is corrupting American 
politics, Brown began his nationally syndicated talk show this week. He 
broadcasts live for two hours every weekday afternoon from a studio here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to take apart the conventional wisdom -- the dumb ideas that are 
wrecking the country, the lies politicians tell, the greed of the corporate 
high and mighty, the phoniness of the wanna-be liberals," Brown says at the 
start of each broadcast. "There are no sacred cows on this show." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, more than 20 radio stations from Seattle to Biloxi, Miss., have picked 
up the program, but none yet in Los Angeles, San Diego or the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown sees his broadcasts as a way to broaden the populist political movement 
he began during his 1992 presidential campaign, hitting such themes as 
political reform, term limits for elected officials and preservation of the 
environment. Some suggest he will serve as a liberal counterpoint to 
conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to stir up citizen involvement for more progressive causes," Brown 
said in an interview. "That's what interests me." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown calls his show "We the People" -- taken from the preamble of the 
Constitution and also the name of his grass-roots political organization. 
Striving for an all-American image, Brown begins each program with a 
country-Western theme song and a group of children reading the preamble. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first broadcasts, the man once branded as Gov. Moonbeam was engaging 
and down-to-earth, answering questions from callers, reading highlights from 
the day's news and at times revealing bits of insight into himself. 
</P>
<P>
 When one caller asked him if he was influenced as governor by contributions 
from special interests, Brown quickly admitted that he was. 
</P>
<P>
 "You bet I was influenced," he said. "You think you can collect $10 million or 
$20 million and not let it affect your judgment? Your behavior is influenced 
and that is the vice that is destroying us." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also hopes to use the show to prompt public activism on specific issues. 
At one point, he gave out the White House telephone number and urged his 
listeners to call President Clinton to voice support for production of 
non-polluting cars. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, this is the role Edmund G. Brown Jr. has been training for all his 
many lives. 
</P>
<P>
 He grew up as the son of a politician, Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, and studied 
under the Jesuits before abandoning the idea of the priesthood. He got into 
politics as a member of the Los Angeles Community College Board, then won 
election as secretary of state in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Running as a political reformer in 1974, he was elected governor and served 
two terms. In some ways, he was ahead of his time, preaching an "era of 
limits," satellite communications and car-pool lanes before many people were 
ready. He ran for president twice, in 1976 and 1980, earning a national 
reputation for his visionary, if sometimes flaky, ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 But as governor, he also presided over the initial decline of the school 
system and got poor marks for his management of state government. In 1982, when 
he ran for the U.S. Senate, his reputation had fallen so low that he was 
defeated by the then-mayor of San Diego, Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 What followed was a period of self-examination. For a time, he grew a beard 
and studied Buddhism in Japan and learned Spanish in Mexico. He did some 
writing and visited Mother Teresa in India. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, he staged a comeback as chairman of the California Democratic Party, 
but again drew criticism over his management style when the party's 
gubernatorial nominee, Dianne Feinstein, lost to Wilson, then a senator. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he says serving as party chairman and raising millions of dollars from 
interest groups finally opened his eyes to the influence of money in politics. 
The experience prompted him to run for president in 1992 on a pledge that he 
would accept no contribution greater than $100. 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining his belated metamorphosis, Brown said, "People who work in a fish 
factory don't realize they stink." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the 55-year-old Brown -- with a decided middle-age paunch and a 
growing bald spot -- seems more relaxed than in the past, but still has the 
riveting brown eyes, the prominent eyebrows and the sharp profile that helped 
make him a charismatic leader in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown got started on his new radio career after he was a guest on columnist 
Jack Anderson's talk show and mentioned it was something he would like to do. 
Afterward, the network that carries Anderson's show, Talk America, contacted 
the former governor and signed him up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really believe this is the avenue Jerry has been looking for for a long 
time," said Tom Star, a Talk America vice president who helped put the show 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first week, Brown has yet to crack the big radio markets in California, 
but stations in Santa Barbara, Sacramento, Fresno, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, 
Redding and Alturas have signed up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're picking up stations every single day," Star said. "We're confident 
we'll have a Los Angeles station within two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 The show is owned by Brown's We the People group, and is free to radio 
stations. Brown said he does not plan to take a salary and will pump ad 
revenues -- when there are some -- into his organization. 
</P>
<P>
 During the shows, Brown talks about some of the people he ran across -- or ran 
against -- during his years in politics. President Clinton, Ross Perot, former 
President George Bush, Oliver North and others are all targets of his wit. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown says he doubts his show will have any effect on the gubernatorial 
campaign of his sister, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown. "We're on a totally 
different track here." The two are close and talk frequently, he said. During 
his first day on the air Monday, one of the calls was from a "Kathy in D.C.," 
who turned out to be sister Kathleen, in Washington on state business, calling 
to wish him luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown plans to pick a different theme for each program, bashing the oil 
companies one day and hitting political contributions the next. "I'm enjoying 
it," he told his listeners. "I hope you are." 
</P>
<P>
 But can the man who would be president find happiness in a radio booth? 
Perhaps. Will he be tempted once again to seek an elective post? "I don't think 
so," he says, "but . . . I obviously enjoy running for office. That's pretty 
clear."

CONSERVATIVE LEGISLATORS SAVOR THEIR VICTORY; POLITICS: CALIFORNIANS CELEBRATE 
SUCCESS IN ATTACHING TO QUAKE RELIEF MEASURE AN AMENDMENT TO BAN LONG-TERM AID 
FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Rep. Ron Packard was beaming. Dana Rohrabacher, his younger, more rambunctious 
Orange County Republican colleague, was brimming with the usual combative 
flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by several other conservative California members during an upbeat 
morning news conference Wednesday in the Capitol, they were luxuriating in a 
rare moment of victory over more liberal Democratic forces that so often have 
been able to dismiss their protestations about illegal immigration as political 
posturing. 
</P>
<P>
 After some hardheaded bargaining with other Appropriations Committee members 
Tuesday, Packard succeeded in attaching an amendment to the California 
earthquake relief package that would deny long-term emergency benefits to 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring a "huge, huge victory," Packard said, "This is the beginning of 
changing government policy on how we spend our social dollars." It also 
appeared to be the curtain-raising on a more prominent Washington role for 
Packard, who has usually chosen a behind-the-scenes persona. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Carlsbad mayor, midway through his sixth term in the House, has 
long been engaged by the immigration issue, and his ascension to the 
Appropriations Committee last year gives him increased visibility and clout. 
</P>
<P>
 But Packard has generally kept his focus on the issue's politically safer 
aspects, such as cracking down on illegal immigration at the border and 
pressing the federal government to reimburse the state for the billions it 
spends on education, health care and imprisonment of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 By taking a lead role in the attempt to restrict emergency funds to illegal 
immigrants, Packard, a former dentist from Oceanside, has stepped into a 
political mine field. It is a move that he felt he had to make, but one that 
runs counter to his make-no-waves Capitol Hill pragmatism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not want to exacerbate what was already a sensitive issue," Packard 
said. "But it's the biggest issue in my district . . . the most crucial problem 
all my cities struggle with." 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to constituents in December, he vowed to add his amendment to 
every appropriations bill. 
</P>
<P>
 But he wishes some other legislation would have been the guinea pig. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little disappointed that this is the first bill out of the chute. The 
amendment will fit a lot better and be more acceptable to other members of 
Congress on several other appropriations bills. This is not the issue that I 
would have preferred to be the very first test." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some Republicans were surprised that the avuncular Packard, who once was 
named by a Capitol Hill newspaper to its "obscure caucus," would tackle such an 
explosive topic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is he fighting this fight? You naturally expect others to do it," said a 
veteran California Republican staffer. "He tapped into something very emotional 
and it makes you wonder if he was put up to it by some of his colleagues on the 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Others noted that he appeared awkward, even ill-prepared, when the interplay 
with committee Democrats became heated and personal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a vocal or outspoken person," Packard said. "I don't get heated up 
quickly. But when some members of (the) committee accused me of 
immigrant-bashing and being mean-spirited, I wanted to make it clear that was 
not my motivation at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I represent a lot of Hispanic-surnamed families, I hired Hispanic citizens in 
my office long before I got to Congress. . . . I have nothing but compassion 
and love for them as a people, but I am sworn to uphold the Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite any personal unease that Packard may have felt going into the 
committee negotiations Tuesday, he entered them with optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not surprised (by the outcome). I had talked to (California Democrats 
on the Appropriations Committee) Reps. (Esteban) Torres, (Julian) Dixon and 
(Vic) Fazio, and I knew they were anxious to move the bill. I thought we could 
reach some compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) thought the amendment language was too vague 
because it didn't spell out what emergency services -- except medical care -- 
would be offered to illegal immigrants; Rep. Ronald D. Coleman (D-Texas) 
foresaw problems in determining whether quake victims were illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard immediately agreed to be more specific about benefits, and Dixon 
offered a compromise to keep the bill alive. 
</P>
<P>
 And Rep. Jose E. Serrano (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Congressional Hispanic 
Caucus, railed: "This issue is not an honest issue. . . . This issue speaks to 
meanness, it speaks to immigrant-bashing . . . it says that everyone who looks 
different is going to be questioned over and over and over again." Then Coleman 
proposed language that would key emergency benefits to existing immigration 
laws and the U.S. Constitution. Saying the move merely clouded the issue, 
Republicans objected but the Demorats tacked it onto the Dixon amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard then withdrew the entire amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fazio, Torres and Dixon huddled with Packard and Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) 
at a long table in a committee hearing room, hoping to find some middle ground. 
The Democrats wanted to avoid potentially more damaging attacks on the House 
floor by addressing the amendment in committee, whereas Republicans saw an 
opening to win a slightly diluted ideological point. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres offered a revised amendment -- stripped of the Coleman language -- and 
Packard had his victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimate success depends on the outcome of floor debate today, but Packard and 
his fellow Republicans had clearly lifted the illegal immigration issue to a 
new plateau. 
</P>
<P>
 For Rohrabacher, of Huntington Beach, the legislative victory gave flight to 
his more visceral kind of rhetoric. "This will have real impact on federal 
agencies' ability to put out a flyer, saying (to illegal immigrants), 'Come on 
in and get the money.' We're all part of the same family, of all racial 
backgrounds. When you're in an emergency situation, what kind of person takes 
limited emergency resources from his own family and gives it to a stranger? We 
cannot afford to supply benefits for illegals without hurting our citizens and 
legal residents."

S. AFRICA CAMPAIGN BUSTS WIDE OPEN; POLITICS: NELSON MANDELA AND SUPPORTERS 
RALLY TO CELEBRATE FREEDOM. PRESIDENT DE KLERK'S PARTY TAKES CREDIT FOR IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The campaign for this nation's future, largely a political fight over who gets 
the credit for ending the bitter apartheid past, erupted into a free-for-all 
Wednesday, the fourth anniversary of the day President Frederik W. de Klerk 
legalized Nelson Mandela's African National Congress and 35 other opposition 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in the Western Cape wine country, Mandela and scores of other former 
political prisoners sought to grab the moral high ground by lighting a "torch 
of freedom," releasing doves and laying a wreath of white flowers on coils of 
razor wire outside Victor Verster prison, where Mandela served the last 14 
months of his 27 years in harsh incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have no imagination of the cruelties that are committed behind those 
walls," Mandela told a sun-splashed rally of chanting, singing supporters at a 
jammed sports stadium in Paarl, north of Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men wearing prison chains and manacles stood mutely in front of the stage 
under a huge banner that proclaimed "Never Again!" 
</P>
<P>
 The solemn scene took on a festive air, however, when the former inmates, many 
now balding and bulging, paraded and danced around the dusty track under 
college-like banners marking their alma maters: "Death Row," "Pretoria 
Central," "Robben Island" and other notorious political prisons of the 
apartheid years. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience was in no mood for anything more formal. 
</P>
<P>
 They surged into a block of seats reserved for dignitaries and cheerfully 
ignored an announcer who vainly appealed through a microphone, "Please 
comrades, a revolutionary call is made on you to leave that area." 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, formality was the order of the night at the National Party congress 
at the World Trade Center in Kempton Park, outside Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
 There, De Klerk launched his party's campaign by seeking -- uncomfortably -- 
to infuse several thousand of his button-down followers with a little bit of 
political soul. 
</P>
<P>
 After leading several still-born chants and cheers, a black minister tried to 
lead the mostly white audience in three verses of "Nkosi Sikeleli i'Afrika," or 
"God Bless Africa," the haunting call-and-response Xhosa hymn that the ANC has 
used for years as a liberation anthem. It is sung with passion at the start of 
every ANC rally, with the audience holding clenched fists aloft and singing in 
unison. 
</P>
<P>
 But the National Party's all-white, six-man band in ill-fitting tuxedos 
mangled the tune. And after a few tries, most delegates gave up and silently 
followed the unfamiliar lyrics distributed on sheets of paper and shown on 
giant video screens at the front of the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk used his speech to claim credit for the liberation of the past and to 
issue a fervent call to arms against the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ANC would cast us back into the Dark Ages," he warned, as the crowd 
politely waved tiny flags. "It is a party secretly controlled by Communists, 
militants and extremists." 
</P>
<P>
 The ANC, he said, "lusts for power and . . . is paying no more than lip 
service to the rights of minorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Its only political experience, he added, "has been in the politics of protest 
and destruction." 
</P>
<P>
 For voters who missed the two events, the parties also faced off in the 
nation's newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Party took out full-page ads in papers across the country. The 
ads not only claimed credit for the end of apartheid but tried to hijack 
Mandela's prison ceremony as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today Mr. Nelson Mandela honors President de Klerk with a 'Flame of Freedom,' 
" the ads read in bold type. 
</P>
<P>
 The fine print said De Klerk had "announced the death of apartheid and set 
South Africa on the road to democracy," including releasing political 
prisoners, abolishing apartheid laws, negotiating a new constitution and 
setting the stage for elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In most papers, the ANC fired back with a two-page ad that was equally 
audacious. 
</P>
<P>
 A huge cartoon showed Mandela as a boxer, with a fallen figure marked 
"apartheid" at his feet. Outside the ring, De Klerk, wearing a white jacket and 
bow tie, clasped his own hands overhead in triumph, saying: "I did it! I did 
it!" 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath the cartoon, the ad warned that "the so-called 'new National Party' is 
looking remarkably similar to the old one. In their latest version of history, 
they are the heroes that changed South Africa. According to them, the people of 
this country played no part in ending apartheid oppression. . . . Next thing 
they'll be telling us apartheid never existed." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the skirmishing was a day of rich political symbolism and ironies. 
</P>
<P>
 But it also showed how the two parties have already identified the voters they 
need and the issues they hope to exploit in the run-up to the country's first 
democratic elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The voting will take place over three days; after two recent changes, it is 
now scheduled for April 26-28. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite published reports, no separate ballot is planned or likely for 
right-wing whites who have threatened repeatedly to launch a campaign of 
violence unless given the right to create a self-ruled white homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Less clear, however, is whether the ANC will give in this week to growing 
demands by members of the Freedom Alliance, a coalition of black and white 
conservative leaders, for voters to be given two ballots instead of one. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the interim constitution, voters will mark only one ballot to show their 
party preference for both the national and provincial assemblies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Freedom Alliance, which includes Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's 
Inkatha Freedom Party, has insisted that it will boycott the elections unless 
voters can split the ticket and choose different parties for the different 
assemblies. 
</P>
<P>
 The ANC has argued that two ballots might be too confusing for illiterate 
voters and would lead to spoiled ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 But a growing number of business leaders, non-governmental groups and Western 
diplomats have urged the ANC to reconsider, saying multiple ballots have been 
used in several emerging democracies without ill effect.

IRA ALLY'S U.S. SUCCESS RILES LONDON; NORTHERN IRELAND: GERRY ADAMS PACKS TWO 
DAYS IN NEW YORK WITH MEDIA APPEARANCES. THE BRITISH COMPLAIN HE WASN'T ASKED 
TOUGH QUESTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN J. GOLDMAN and WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At one point before returning home on Wednesday after his brief visit to New 
York, Gerry Adams looked into the massed lenses of no less than 20 television 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 If the medium was the message, the head of the political wing of the outlawed 
Irish Republican Army was an omnipresent messenger. In the 48 hours his visa 
allowed, the bearded, professorial-looking leader of Ireland's islandwide, 
legal Sinn Fein party appeared on CNN's "Larry King Live," cut a broad swath 
through the morning talk shows, showed up on "The Phil Donahue Show" in the 
afternoon, held several news conferences and even did a stint on public 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Adams boarded a flight out of Kennedy Airport on Wednesday night, 
the British government was lamenting his success and diplomats were scrambling 
to repair bruises on the "special relationship" between the United States and 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 British officials appeared taken aback by the blaze of favorable publicity 
attending Adams' visit, which London had staunchly opposed and which President 
Clinton allowed despite advice to the contrary from his own Cabinet. Adams had 
been barred from the United States on eight previous occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 The British complained that U.S. news media seemed uninterested in hearing 
their side of Adams' argument for an end to London's rule in Northern Ireland. 
And they maintained that the media let Adams off lightly in interviews, rarely 
asking tough questions or pinning him down after evasive answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is now a member of Parliament for West Belfast who replaced, who kicked 
out, Gerry Adams," British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd lamented from London 
on Wednesday on CNN. "Who is going to ask that member of Parliament into chat 
shows in the United States?" 
</P>
<P>
 Adams was elected to the British Parliament as the representative of West 
Belfast in June, 1983. He did not take his seat because it required pledging an 
oath to Queen Elizabeth II. 
</P>
<P>
 And speaking in the House of Commons, Hurd declared: "The test is whether Mr. 
Adams is now prepared at last to bring violence to a permanent end. He is a 
failed politician. . . . It would be quite wrong if he were given some special 
treatment simply because he has used the bomb and the bullet to disguise the 
fact that electorally he has not been successful." 
</P>
<P>
 British Prime Minister John Major was said by a senior aide to regard Adams' 
New York statements as "a smoke screen of evasions and falsehoods." 
</P>
<P>
 "While Adams was telling the Americas he favored peace," the aide said, "his 
movement was firing mortars in Northern Ireland." 
</P>
<P>
 Major welcomed Clinton's rejection of Adams' call for U.S. intervention in the 
process of searching for peace in Northern Ireland, his aides said. Further, 
Major was reported to be thankful that Clinton decided to abandon a campaign 
pledge to send an American envoy to Northern Ireland to assess the 25-year-old 
sectarian conflict -- a move opposed by the British. 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring that Adams produced no new ideas, Major's aides said it was nonsense 
for Adams to state, as he did on his visit, that the "ball was in the British 
court." 
</P>
<P>
 "He arrived in New York with the ball firmly at his feet," said one. "He 
leaves with the ball firmly at his feet. Sinn Fein has been challenged to enter 
the democratic arena and has not so far had the courage to take up that 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Major and Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds in December produced a 
framework for peace negotiations in which Sinn Fein could participate, but only 
after the IRA laid down its arms. 
</P>
<P>
 The aides warned that the peace process "cannot and will not wait for Sinn 
Fein." 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Seitz, the U.S. ambassador to Britain, acknowledged Wednesday that the 
decision to admit Adams to the United States had caused a "big tussle" in the 
Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people argued against it and a lot of people argued for it," Seitz 
told a parliamentary press lunch in London. "The President took a chance. I 
hope the experience in the U.S. will persuade Gerry Adams that respectability 
and legitimacy are nice things to have. I hope it will act as an encouragement 
for him to renounce violence and condemn it when it occurs. We will have to 
wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the Adams visa decision did not signal "a collapse of confidence 
across the Atlantic." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry denied that Adams' 
visit had damaged the "special relationship" between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the gloomy assessment that you've heard from some sources in the 
British media is not an accurate characterization of the relationship," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman reported from New York, Tuohy from London.

VETERANS GROUPS FIGHT A FINAL VIETNAM BATTLE -- THE TRADE EMBARGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Veterans organizations and families of missing Vietnam War-era servicemen 
mounted a last-ditch effort Wednesday to dissuade President Clinton from 
lifting the trade embargo against Vietnam -- even as Clinton confirmed that his 
decision is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 In brief remarks at the White House before meeting with congressional leaders, 
Clinton insisted that he has still not decided whether to lift the 2-decade-old 
embargo but will do so within "the next couple of days." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials and congressional sources have been saying for some 
time that he will end the trade ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the timing of the move has remained in doubt as the President's political 
advisers have tried to assess the level of opposition to the move. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans organizations and family members, who want a fuller accounting of the 
missing servicemen before the embargo is lifted, have been very vocal in their 
disapproval. 
</P>
<P>
 But their opposition has failed to produce the groundswell of criticism from 
other quarters that some White House advisers had been anticipating -- and to 
which Clinton is vulnerable politically, since he avoided military service 
during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people just seem to be getting tired of the issue," said a 
congressional source, adding that his office has been surprised by the muted 
reaction last week when the Senate recommended in a non-binding resolution that 
Clinton lift the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 The source said his Senate office received the expected protests from the 
leaders of POW-MIA family groups but only six calls from constituents 
expressing an opinion about the 62-38 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Another source close to the issue said senators favoring an end to the embargo 
were urging Clinton to act swiftly after the Senate vote to take advantage of 
the "political cover" that it was meant to afford him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will never be an easy decision. But on the other hand, it will never be 
easier than it is now," the source added. 
</P>
<P>
 That impression was reinforced by the congressional leaders who met with 
Clinton at the White House and said afterward that they urged him to act 
quickly so that U.S. companies eager to trade with Vietnam are not preempted by 
European and Japanese competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies have been pressuring the Administration to lift the embargo, which 
outlawed all American trade with the Southeast Asian nation after the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanoi too has eagerly sought renewed relations to help boost its economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ought to look . . . at the potential market. To delay and delay and delay, 
we're simply going to be preempted by others," House Minority Leader Robert H. 
Michel (R-Ill.) said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to put the war behind us," added Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), 
expressing what appeared to be the bipartisan consensus of the lawmakers who 
conferred with Clinton. "I hope he will go forward. I hope the decision will be 
favorable." 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging privately that they may have been slow in organizing their 
opposition, family groups and veterans organizations said they will redouble 
their efforts over the next few days to persuade Clinton that the embargo 
should not be lifted until Hanoi does more to account for the 2,200 servicemen 
officially listed as missing in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the American Legion said his organization is reassessing its 
strategy after the Senate vote and is urging its 3.1 million members to call or 
send telegrams to the White House protesting the apparent decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast 
Asia, the nation's largest POW-MIA family group, also appealed to Clinton to 
withhold his decision until the group can visit Hanoi to determine whether 
Vietnam is cooperating "as fully as possible" in the effort to account for 
missing Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Administration has repeatedly urged us to go to Vietnam and see for 
ourselves" if the Vietnamese are being fully cooperative, League Executive 
Director Ann Mills Griffiths said. "Now we are asking the Vietnamese if we can 
do just that and . . . we hope that (Clinton) will not undercut our trip" by 
lifting the embargo before the mission has returned. 
</P>
<P>
 In making its case for lifting the embargo, the Administration has contended 
that, although 2,200 servicemen are still officially listed as missing, only a 
dozen or so cases actually remain unresolved.

WHITEWATER PAPER TRAIL IS PROVING HAUNTING TO SOME; CLINTON ARKANSAS 
ACQUAINTANCES COMPLAIN THEY MUST PROVIDE DETAILED ACCOUNTING OF S&L AFFAIR, 
WHILE WHITE HOUSE STAYS SILENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 At 2:30 each afternoon, Beverly Bassett Schaffer leaves her downtown law 
offices to pick up her 6-year-old daughter, then the two of them go home to 
watch children's shows on the Nickelodeon cable channel. For Schaffer, a figure 
in the political affair known simply as Whitewater, it's a way to briefly shut 
out the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's how I deal with the stress," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't really worked. Schaffer moved to this college town in northwestern 
Arkansas in part to escape the pressures of her former life as a public 
official. But now she can't hide from the flood of press calls, the camera 
crews, the constant questions about her actions nine years ago as a top 
securities regulator in Bill Clinton's state government. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, she approved a petition by Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan 
to sell preferred stock to raise enough money to satisfy the capital 
requirements of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. The lawyer retained by 
Madison owner James B. McDougal to submit the plan was Hillary Rodham Clinton, 
a partner in the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Ark. The Clintons were partners 
with McDougal in the Whitewater land development company. 
</P>
<P>
 Madison's condition deteriorated so rapidly that it never took advantage of 
Schaffer's ruling, and was closed in 1989 by federal regulators. Nevertheless, 
Schaffer is part of the widening circle of people from Bill Clinton's past who 
find themselves increasingly on the spot as the White House public relations 
machinery moves to insulate the First Family from the controversy and shift 
attention to other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Clintons deciding not to open their records on the affair to the 
public or provide a detailed public accounting of it, this group in Arkansas -- 
bankers who loaned Clinton money, state officials who had banking oversight, 
contributors to Clinton's campaigns -- are being pressed to fill in the vacuum 
with what they know of what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, like Schaffer, the frustration of this position is growing. "I don't 
have any spin doctors," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to defend herself and her actions as commissioner of the Arkansas 
Securities Department, Schaffer is now preparing her own personal "white paper 
on Whitewater." She says that she wants to lay out her side of the story and 
get the country off her back. 
</P>
<P>
 The central questions in the Whitewater affair include whether the Clintons, 
as half-owners of the land development venture, were aware that their partner 
may have been mingling funds from his savings and loan in the land business' 
accounts. Also raised is whether political influence helped keep that 
high-rolling savings and loan open longer than it would otherwise have been, 
increasing the cost to the federal government of its eventual federal bailout. 
Robert B. Fiske Jr., the special counsel appointed by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, 
will take over the federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton acquaintances in Arkansas are increasingly complaining that their 
pieces of the puzzle are receiving exaggerated attention because the Clintons, 
at center stage, have not been forthcoming with theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaffer insists that her place falls in the category of guilt by association 
-- or, more precisely, guilt by false assumption. "People don't understand 
Arkansas," she said. "This is a small state, and everybody knows everybody 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 For Schaffer, the connections in question were with the Clintons and with 
Madison Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 While working as a securities lawyer at a Little Rock law firm in the summer 
of 1984, Schaffer says, she was assigned by one of the firm's partners to 
complete some paperwork for Madison Guaranty. The Arkansas Securities 
Commission, then run by Lee Thalheimer, had questions about Madison's far-flung 
and heavily leveraged real estate ventures, so Schaffer said she wrote a cover 
letter accompanying Madison owner McDougal's response. The Whitewater project 
was not included; most of the regulatory questions concerned McDougal's plan to 
build an island resort complex off the coast of Nova Scotia. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaffer insists the assignment was so routine she didn't think to mention it 
to Clinton or to anyone else in state government when Clinton appointed her to 
succeed Thalheimer a few months later. 
</P>
<P>
 But the assignment left behind a paper trail that would haunt Schaffer when 
Whitewater finally blew up. The questions only intensified when McDougal 
alleged in press interviews that Clinton appointed Schaffer as securities 
commissioner as a favor to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaffer, who held the securities post for six years, angrily denies the 
allegation, insisting that she had never met or talked with McDougal. "I still 
wouldn't know the man if he was in the same room with me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she judged the Madison proposal strictly on its merits and wonders 
why the Clintons have not come forward to help stand up for her, or why Mrs. 
Clinton herself has not been more forthcoming about her own role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why she hasn't been more open," Schaffer says. In the end, she 
said, "the people left behind in Arkansas are bearing the brunt of this."

CLINTON AND GOP COMPETE TO STEAL LIMELIGHT ON CRIME ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The federal war on crime may be in danger of being overshadowed by a struggle 
over which political party is tougher on lawbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle has been touched off by President Clinton, who -- in his 
determination to prove himself a different kind of Democrat -- is taking a hard 
line on crime. It is an issue the Republicans have owned for a generation, and 
one they can ill afford to lose at a time when other weapons in their 
ideological arsenal have lost their potency. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal-justice experts contend that this competition has more to do with 
symbolism than substance -- and they warn that whichever side wins, citizens 
hoping for safer neighborhoods are likely to be disappointed because most of 
the remedies under debate don't reach the root causes of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But as analysts point out, symbolism is often decisive in national politics. 
"The fact of the matter is that politics is a game of perception of reality," 
said GOP pollster Anthony Fabrizio. "Polls measure people's perceptions, and 
their perceptions become our reality." 
</P>
<P>
 It is easy to see why Clinton's rhetoric on crime alarms the GOP. Republicans 
have always had difficulty competing on certain issues, largely those linked to 
social programs and government activism. 
</P>
<P>
 And Republicans contend that Clinton sounds like Democrats have always sounded 
on such issues. "He is saying: 'Give us your money and we'll take care of you,' 
" said conservative Republican leader and 1996 presidential prospect, William 
J. Bennett. "Republicans cannot win the 'I can take care of you' game." 
</P>
<P>
 During the Ronald Reagan Administration, Republicans could depend on the 
public's fear of communism and confidence in GOP economic management to build 
presidential majorities. But the collapse of the Soviet Union and President 
George Bush's failure to deal with the recession left crime as one of the few 
issues on which they could reasonably expect to out-poll the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton started taking the issue away during the 1992 campaign. Unlike recent 
Democratic standard-bearers, the Arkansas governor supported capital punishment 
-- even returning to Little Rock, Ark., in the midst of his presidential 
campaign to oversee an execution. 
</P>
<P>
 But his most dramatic bid to seize the issue came in his State of the Union 
Address last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Most notable was Clinton's endorsement of the "three-strikes-and-you're-out" 
idea embodied in the crime bill passed by the Senate last year. Clinton 
specifically backed life sentences for criminals convicted of three violent 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime bill -- which has an uncertain future in the House -- would 
authorize $22.5 billion over five years to fight crime. It includes money for a 
host of projects, including $6 billion for construction of prisons and 
military-style boot camps for criminals; almost $8 billion to help communities 
put 100,000 more police officers on the streets; and more than $8 billion in 
social and crime-prevention programs, such as drug treatment for prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Stung by Clinton, the Republicans struck back. Led by Senate GOP leader Bob 
Dole of Kansas and Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip, 10 
GOP lawmakers used a Capitol Hill press conference to accuse Clinton of being 
unwilling to back up his tough talk on crime with money and action. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Ronald Reagan speech, Jimmy Carter details," said Florida Sen. Connie Mack. 
And Texas Sen. Phil Gramm claimed that Clinton's budget proposals last year cut 
funding for prison construction by $580 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But some criminal-justice experts say both parties are deluding the public by 
promoting superficial solutions to a complex problem that is caused in large 
part by fundamental weaknesses in society. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must deal with prevention or you will drown in enforcement," said Donald 
E. Santarelli, who headed the Federal Law Enforcement Assistance Administration 
under President Richard Nixon and is now chairman of the National Committee on 
Community Corrections, a nonpartisan group working to link the correctional 
system more closely to local communities.

NOMINEE TAKES HARD LINE ON N. KOREA; ARMS: DEFENSE SECRETARY-DESIGNATE PERRY 
TELLS SENATE PANEL THAT PYONGYANG FACES SANCTIONS IF IT DOES NOT SUBMIT TO 
WEAPONS INSPECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defense Secretary-designate William J. Perry warned Wednesday that the Clinton 
Administration is almost out of patience with North Korea over its refusal to 
submit to international weapons inspections and might soon seek imposition of 
economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry's remarks, echoed by the State Department, came in testimony at his 
confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 He cautioned that if North Korea remains recalcitrant, the Administration 
might have to decide on the sanctions question "very soon." 
</P>
<P>
 The new, tougher language followed a series of signals from North Korea that, 
in the view of American officials, show Pyongyang's unwillingness to go along 
with international inspection efforts, despite assurances a week ago that it 
was ready to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 Goaded by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who charged that the Administration is 
concentrating on "appeasement" of North Korea when it should be wielding 
"sticks," Perry snapped: "There are sticks downstream also." 
</P>
<P>
 He then pointed to the possibility of sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 In a later exchange, McCain suggested that the Administration intensify 
American pressure on China to stop its human rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry replied that the Administration hopes to persuade China to pressure 
North Korea on the nuclear front. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he fully supports the human rights issue, Perry said, "it . . . will 
pale in comparison with the prospects of a nuclear war on the Korean 
Peninsula." 
</P>
<P>
 The warning by Perry came in an otherwise routine hearing with the committee, 
in which senators made it clear that he will win confirmation easily. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel is expected to endorse his nomination today in time for quick Senate 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea's behavior has embarrassed the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, senior Administration officials announced an agreement under which 
North Korea would begin to comply with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 But since then, the North Koreans have resumed their defiance of American 
wishes, feigning ignorance about inspection procedures and threatening to 
withdraw from the treaty again -- the same action that, early last year, 
precipitated the current conflict with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes after Perry spoke, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry 
called the North Korean actions "provocative." 
</P>
<P>
 He too warned that the "diplomatic path" the United States has been pursuing 
"is not an endless path." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry's testimony on Wednesday ranged over an array of defense and national 
security issues, designed partly to show that the 66-year-old former 
engineering professor is not just a narrow-interest technology and procurement 
specialist, as some critics have implied. 
</P>
<P>
 In prepared testimony, he also pointedly listed five broad defense issues -- 
ranging from overseeing military operations and maintaining readiness to 
setting broad strategy and deciding budget issues -- as major responsibilities, 
with priority over technology and acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in a conspicuous reference to the refusal by departing Defense Secretary 
Les Aspin last autumn to send tanks to back up American troops in Somalia, 
Perry pledged "to provide the required support (to U.S. military commanders) as 
they direct our forces in the field." 
</P>
<P>
 His performance appeared to delight committee members, many of whom praised 
his articulate answers and grasp of issues.

U.S. OFFICIALS PLAY DOWN ABUSES IN MEXICO UPRISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Department officials acknowledged on Wednesday that "some human rights 
abuses may have occurred" after last month's peasant uprising in Mexico, but 
they asserted that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari responded in "a 
forthcoming and responsible way." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Clinton Administration's first public testimony on the insurrection in 
the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, officials said they had been assured 
that those found guilty of abuses will be punished. 
</P>
<P>
 But other witnesses at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing took a 
harsher view of events in Chiapas, where 2,000 members of the Zapatista 
National Liberation Army took control of four county seats on New Year's Day 
before relinquishing control several days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando Hernandez, a Mayan leader in Chiapas, testified that the killing and 
disappearance of native people by the army "is a common and daily occurrence." 
</P>
<P>
 Juan E. Mendez, executive director of Human Rights Watch/Americas, said 
members of his group who visited Chiapas found evidence of summary executions, 
disappearances and torture. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chiapas, Salinas' political party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party 
(PRI), "bears little resemblance to the image of modernization . . . that 
Salinas has carefully cultivated," Mendez said. He added that "rural bosses 
with close ties to the PRI own not only the land -- they also own the local 
police, civil authorities and judges." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander F. Watson, assistant secretary of state for Latin American affairs, 
said he does not wish to challenge the Mexicans' testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 But he told the Western Hemisphere subcommittee that Salinas should be 
commended for "attempting to establish a peaceful dialogue with the rebels." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said Salinas had taken steps to resolve the crisis, including 
instructing government officials on Jan. 6 "to respect the human rights of the 
civilian population." 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, he replaced his interior minister and appointed Foreign 
Minister Manuel Camacho Solis, known as a skilled negotiator, to serve as 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation, Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A resolution of the broader problems in Chiapas will not be achieved 
overnight," he testified. "It is an area of deep inequalities, where powerful 
landlords and local bosses have conspired to thwart the aspirations for justice 
and better standards of living for the rural populations." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson also responded to critics who assert that the uprising showed Mexico to 
be an unworthy economic partner of the United States in the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, which the Administration pushed through Congress last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The legitimate grievances of the people of southern Mexico were neither 
caused by NAFTA nor should NAFTA be in any way compromised by these 
developments," he said. "Indeed, the events in Chiapas demonstrated more 
clearly than ever the need for NAFTA (because) Mexico will be drawn more into 
the Western community of nations." 
</P>
<P>
 Amnesty International, confirming statements by the group in Mexico City last 
month, gave the subcommittee a report charging the army with gross violations 
of human rights -- terrorizing Indian villages and beating, torturing and 
kidnaping inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, in Mexico, officials reacted to the American hearings with 
equanimity that would have been surprising only a few years ago; this, perhaps, 
was a reflection of the closer U.S.-Mexican relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 The most critical comment came from Andres Rosenthal, undersecretary of 
foreign relations, who said they "were hardly a friendly thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 But Senate Majority Leader Emilio M. Gonzalez said American legislators "have 
every right to express their opinions. Criticisms between countries are 
inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Juanita Darling in Mexico City contributed to this report.

WIDESPREAD ABUSE OF WOMEN REPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Women around the world are being subject to widespread abuses ranging from 
denial of the vote to mutilation and murder, says the State Department's annual 
report on global human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The report includes a country-by-country look at conditions affecting 
women.Several of the 193 country reports were released this week, with the full 
study to be published later. 
</P>
<P>
 Genital mutilation in African countries, rape of female prisoners in Pakistan, 
exploitation of servants in the Persian Gulf states and wife murders in India 
and Bangladesh are among the problems cited in the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "That female life is not valued as much as male life is apparent in countries 
such as China, where it is reported that more female fetuses than male are 
aborted," an overview of the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond physical abuse, it said, "women throughout the world were subjected to 
onerous and discriminatory restrictions of such fundamental freedoms as voting, 
marriage, travel, testifying in court, inheriting and owning property and 
obtaining custody of children."

 * If several thousand more U.N. ground troops are deployed to Bosnia first to 
defend those already vulnerable to a hostile reaction -- an expansion of the 
operation that would take weeks if not months to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the purported authorization for close NATO air support and 
possible air strikes varies little from the United Nations' longstanding 
approach of trying to feed and care for what remains of Bosnia's population 
while the war that has made them victims is left to burn on. 
</P>
<P>
 Aid officials and U.N. sources say they are baffled by the verbal 
saber-rattling, which has provoked bellicose warnings from Bosnian Serb leaders 
while offering no real prospects for resolving the ever more intractable war. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12,000 U.N. troops currently deployed in Bosnia are assigned to escort aid 
convoys across ubiquitous roadblocks and a meandering 1,000-mile-long series of 
front lines that cut through this country like a jigsaw. 
</P>
<P>
 The lightly armed U.N. forces are mostly tolerated by the warring factions, 
because they are neutral and because the food convoys they protect are 
sustaining Bosnians of all ethnic backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the mission were to lose its humanitarian character, the prevailing 
sentiment is that the ground troops and the aid agencies would have to pull 
out," said one official of the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 But he conceded that the refugee agency's success rate in getting food to 
hungry civilians has suffered tremendously this winter, with increasing 
attempts by all combatants to prevent aid from getting through to rival 
populations. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the U.N. refugee agency report that only about 20% of the 
starvation ration they were attempting to get through to Muslim communities in 
central Bosnia actually reached its target in December and early January. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. military and administrative sources complain that the renewed threats of 
NATO force are probably unnecessary to achieve the Srebrenica troop rotation 
and that they are irrelevant regarding Tuzla airport, because the U.N. 
Protection Force has neither the soldiers nor the equipment to operate an 
airlift there like the one that feeds 380,000 in Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has already conceded some ground in the 
Srebrenica standoff, saying his gunmen ringing the Muslim enclave will allow a 
Dutch company to replace the 156 Canadian troops now stationed there, as long 
as the rotation does not increase the size or the defensive capabilities of the 
U.N.-designated "safe area." An advance group of Dutch troops reportedly has 
now entered the area. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Serbian forces that occupy 70% of Bosnia have drawn the line at 
opening Tuzla airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every plane which lands at the airport in Tuzla by force would never take off 
again," Bosnian Serb Gen. Manojlo Milovanovic threatened over the weekend, 
adding that his forces had the Tuzla runway within their gun sights. 
</P>
<P>
 Road convoys headed for the Tuzla region -- where nearly 1 million people live 
in the largest enclave still under government control -- have been repeatedly 
thwarted by fighting between Muslims and Croatian rebels in central Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic has said he objects to allowing U.N. relief goods to be flown into 
Tuzla because he fears the airport would become a conduit for weapons being 
smuggled in for the underdog government army. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.N. officials and Western diplomats who monitor the Bosnian crisis from 
surrounding countries note that the Sarajevo airlift has sustained embattled 
residents of the capital and allowed them to resist being overrun by the 
surrounding Serbs. They speculate that regular food deliveries to Tuzla would 
also strengthen government and Muslim resolve to fight off the ethnic 
partitioning the Serbs are trying to impose. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic has said he would allow Tuzla airport to be opened for relief flights 
only if his forces had control of the facility. The airport, closed since the 
war broke out, remains in the hands of the government but within about five 
miles of Serbian tanks and artillery. 
</P>
<P>
 By making Srebrenica and Tuzla into test cases for the possible use of Western 
force in the Balkans, Boutros-Ghali may be banking on successful achievement of 
the troop rotation without conflict and playing for time on the Tuzla relief 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Debate within NATO, particularly between the United States and France, has 
become heated over the need to stop the fighting in Bosnia, and Boutros-Ghali 
may be using the threat of air strikes to compel the feuding allies to agree on 
a common approach to the Balkan crisis.

ADMINISTRATION TO ASK REFORM OF SUPERFUND; ENVIRONMENT: PROPOSAL WOULD SPEED 
CLEANUPS OF TOXIC SITES AND TRIM LAWSUITS. IT WOULD ALSO APPORTION LIABILITY 
AMONG POTENTIAL POLLUTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, in an effort to reform the $15.2-billion Superfund 
program, today will send Congress a proposal designed to make the process of 
cleaning the nation's most polluted places fairer and faster. 
</P>
<P>
 Included are taxes on the insurance industry, a scheme to apportion liability 
among polluters and powerful incentives for polluters to accept their 
responsibility and proceed with costly cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
 While the prospect of these reforms has raised fear and suspicion among the 
nation's insurers and manufacturers, community leaders are expected to find 
much in the Administration's reform plan to cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has sought to preserve a principle dear to the hearts of 
environmentalists and communities -- that polluters should pay to clean up the 
messes they create -- and to strengthen the communities' hands in the cleanup 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Before cleanups begin, communities would negotiate with the Environmental 
Protection Agency over how clean the Superfund site should be made and what its 
future use should be. 
</P>
<P>
 And to the relief of virtually all parties to the debate, the Administration 
will seek to control the lawsuits that now swirl around Superfund cleanups. 
With roughly one Superfund dollar in four going toward legal fees, the program 
has been a boon for attorneys but a bane for those wishing that more of the 
$500 million in annual legal costs were going to cleanup operations. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton last May called Superfund "a disaster" and directed the EPA 
to overhaul the 1980 act that established a legal framework for the cleanup of 
thousands of abandoned landfills, manufacturing sites, mines and federal 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 By last April, 1,286 polluted sites, 96 of them in California, had been put on 
the Superfund's "national priority list," while another 11,500 potential sites 
awaited further consideration. But after government expenditures of roughly 
$1.5 billion yearly -- and far more by private industry -- only 217 sites have 
officially been declared clean. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech at a Superfund site in Cleveland last November, EPA Administrator 
Carol Browner told community leaders: "This is our last chance. If we care 
about cleaning up these toxic sites, if we care about giving industry a strong 
incentive to be mindful of our environment, if we care about rebuilding our 
cities, then we have to seize this opportunity and fix Superfund." 
</P>
<P>
 The fixes proposed by the Administration, while baffling in their technical 
and legal complexity, are simple in their concept. They would make cleanups 
faster and lawsuits fewer by establishing a system in which EPA-approved 
arbitrators, called "private allocators," would apportion liability among 
potential polluters. 
</P>
<P>
 If those found liable accepted the judgments and conducted cleanups, they 
would receive two substantial benefits. The federal government, and not the 
surviving polluters, would pick up the tab for polluters who had disappeared or 
gone out of business. And the government would reimburse those found liable for 
20% to 60% of the money they spent on cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
 To raise these funds, the Administration will ask Congress to approve between 
$500 million and $800 million a year in "fees and assessments" on the property 
and casualty insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the current Superfund law, liable parties get stuck with the cleanup 
bill for many "orphan companies" that have gone out of business or disappeared. 
Rather than foot the bill for all of the cleanup, the existing polluters have 
sought to spread the expense by suing their insurance companies as well as 
smaller firms that may have contributed to the pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, experts said, has been a flurry of lawsuits that divert funds and 
energy away from cleanups. The EPA officials estimated that the reform would 
induce 80% to 95% of the liable parties to settle and proceed with cleaning up 
fouled sites rather than suing. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers are skeptical of the new "private allocators" and the insurance 
industry has expressed concern about the new taxes.

EX-POLICEMAN OFFERS ALIBI FOR BECKWITH IN MURDER CASE; TRIAL: REPEATING 
30-YEAR-OLD TESTIMONY, WITNESS SAYS ACCUSED WAS 90 MILES AWAY WHEN MEDGAR EVERS 
WAS KILLED. HE ADMITS FRIENDSHIP WITH SUSPECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Unwavering and sometimes combative, a retired police officer Wednesday 
repeated the testimony he gave 30 years ago in the Medgar Evers murder trial: 
that he had seen accused assassin Byron De La Beckwith 90 miles away from 
Jackson less than an hour after Evers was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination, James Holley also said he was a longtime friend of 
Beckwith, whom he referred to by his nickname, Delay. Holley, 65, who is white, 
also said that in 1963 he was a strong believer in segregation. Beckwith is an 
avowed racist. 
</P>
<P>
 Evers, the Mississippi field secretary for the NAACP, was slain about 12:30 
a.m. on June 12, 1963, as he got out of his car at his home in Jackson. 
Holley's testimony -- and that of two other officers -- placing Beckwith at a 
gas station in Greenwood, Miss., was considered crucial in 1964, when two 
all-white juries failed to reach verdicts in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time eight of the 12 jury members are African Americans. And in the 
current trial -- Beckwith's third for the murder -- the officers' testimony 
must be weighed against that of witnesses who say they heard Beckwith brag over 
the years that he killed the 37-year-old civil rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Evers had spearheaded voter-registration drives and campaigns to end 
segregation of schools and public facilities in Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 According to previous testimony, Beckwith was an outspoken racist and gun 
enthusiast given to threatening violence against civil rights leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Ed Peters tried to discredit Holley, accusing him of coordinating 
his testimony with Lt. Hollis Cresswell, his former partner who was ruled to be 
too ill to testify at this trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters suggested that Holley lied to help a "buddy." Holley, who earlier said 
he and Beckwith had been friends since the late 1940s or early 1950s, replied 
that he and Beckwith were not close and said: "There were very few times I ever 
talked to the man." 
</P>
<P>
 Holley also contradicted himself when answering questions about Beckwith's 
racial views. He first said he knew Beckwith's views regarding segregation, 
adding: "He's outspoken." 
</P>
<P>
 But Holley later said he did not know if Beckwith was a segregationist. 
</P>
<P>
 Holley also acknowledged that he never reported seeing Beckwith in Greenwood 
to anyone other than Beckwith's attorney during the seven months the suspect 
was in jail awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "You let your buddy Delay stay there all that time and never once went to any 
law enforcement officer to say: 'You've got the wrong m" Peters asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No police officer ever asked me," Holley answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Evers' death is one of a number of unsolved murders stemming from the civil 
rights struggle of the 1960s. Interest in the case was evidenced by the packed 
courtroom and the presence of civil rights leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 During a break in the trial, National NAACP Chairman William Gibson said he 
hoped this trial would be a step toward resolving the others, which include the 
deaths of three civil rights workers in Philadelphia, Miss., a NAACP official 
in Florida and a civil rights worker in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 "Statements have been made that maybe there should not be another trial 
because so much time has passed or there's been too many trials," Gibson said. 
"But the NAACP stands firmly supporting this trial." Calling Evers a "great man 
and a great civil rights warrior, husband and father," he said: "We hope that 
justice is done finally, finally."  
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that this trial is going on is a sign of change," said D'Army 
Bailey, a circuit court judge in Memphis who helped found the National Civil 
Rights Museum in Memphis. "The makeup of the jury is evidence that there has 
been change."

19 CHILDREN FOUND LIVING IN ROACH-INFESTED APARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Chicago Police Department officers staging a drug raid on a two-bedroom 
apartment Wednesday instead found 19 small children living in utter squalor, 
eating out of dog bowls and sleeping on the floor among hordes of cockroaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw babies everywhere," said Police Officer Linda Burns. "The apartment was 
filthy. I'm talking feces, garbage, food on the floor. I don't know how to 
describe it -- it was just filth." 
</P>
<P>
 Two adults were in the apartment when police arrived, and four more showed up 
while police were there. The adults were charged with contributing to the 
neglect of a child, a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen of the children were under 8 years old. Several soiled tots shared 
an unmade roach-covered mattress on the floor of a room with crumbling walls. 
Another six children slept on the floor wearing only dirty underwear. Two small 
children were found squabbling over a neck bone with a dog. The stove was 
inoperable and the refrigerator held only moldy, crusted food. 
</P>
<P>
 A 4-year-old boy who suffered from cerebral palsy lay on the cold floor. 
Police said he showed signs of abuse, including bruises and what appeared to be 
cigarette burns on his body. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was taken to a hospital, and the others to a Department of Children 
and Family Services shelter. Angry police officers said the oldest child, a 
14-year-old, acted more responsibly than the adults did in helping the police 
find clothing among the mess for the rest of the children. Not one clean diaper 
could be found. 
</P>
<P>
 The police were admitted to the apartment by Maxine Melton, 26, the mother of 
five of the children. Police said she also had taken in at least three 
displaced sisters, their 14 children and two men related to some of the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother of two of the children was traced later Wednesday to a hospital 
where she had just given birth to her third child. 
</P>
<P>
 One hour after being booked, the adults fell asleep in the holding cell. 
"That's as much as they gave a heck about their kids," said Lt. Fred Bosse.

DOORWAY KILLING BRINGS NO INDICTMENT

<P>
 A grand jury Wednesday refused to indict a homeowner who shot and killed a 
Scottish businessman who was banging on his back door in the middle of the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew De Vries, 28, was shot Jan. 7 in an affluent Houston 
neighborhood.Homeowner Jeffrey Agee told police that he opened fire because he 
feared that De Vries was a burglar. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harris County grand jury deliberated for less than 30 minutes before 
announcing its decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Gelt and Fiona De Vries, who traveled from Scotland to seek answers in their 
son's death, said they were outraged and refused Agee's request to meet with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the whole bunch are cowards," De Vries said. "We're disgusted," Mrs. 
De Vries added. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, De Vries rang Agee's doorbell twice, hiding each time 
that Agee came to the door. He then jumped a back yard fence and banged on 
glass doors. Agee fired three times through the doors, hitting De Vries twice.

CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS RENOUNCES FARRAKHAN PACT; RACE RELATIONS: PANEL 
CHAIRMAN MFUME LABELS ANTI-SEMITIC REMARKS MADE BY AIDE TO LEADER OF NATION OF 
ISLAM 'EVIL AND VICIOUS.' REPLY IS EXPECTED TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Congressional Black Caucus Wednesday renounced its "sacred covenant" to 
cooperate with controversial Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan in the wake 
of mounting furor over Farrakhan's refusal to repudiate an anti-Semitic 
outburst by one of his aides. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.), chairman of the caucus, who proclaimed the 
so-called covenant last September, told a press conference that his group's 
ability to work with Farrakhan has been severely jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
 Mfume labeled "evil and vicious" the remarks made by Khalid Abdul Muhammad on 
Nov. 29 at Keene College in New Jersey, when he referred to Jews as "blood 
suckers of the black nation." Mfume said: "Nowhere in American life can we give 
sanctuary to such garbage." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the pressure on Farrakhan to denounce the remarks, the Senate voted 
its own unanimous condemnation of them Wednesday in a resolution offered by 
Sens. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.) and Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). 
</P>
<P>
 "If Mr. Farrakhan wants to enter the political and social mainstream, then his 
actions will have to speak louder than the words of some of his associates," 
said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
 Mfume said that Farrakhan has scheduled a press conference here today to 
announce how he will deal with Muhammad. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what Farrakhan says, however, the episode has laid bare what one 
analyst called "an open wound" in American urban society: the pervasive 
friction between two minority groups that have suffered discrimination and 
often find themselves in an intense rivalry for jobs, education and the chance 
to live in a peaceful neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a failure of many Jews to understand the sense of crisis in the 
black community," said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. On the other hand, 
Mellman contended, "there is a lack of appreciation by blacks of Jewish 
anxieties over their embracing people like Farrakhan who are vicious 
anti-Semites." 
</P>
<P>
 In political terms, this latest eruption is a sign of a dangerous erosion in 
the time-worn alliance of constituency groups that elected Bill Clinton to the 
presidency and on which nearly all Democratic office-seekers depend. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just another sign of a fracturing of the traditional Democratic 
coalition," said Steve Erie, a UC San Diego specialist in urban politics. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed out that many of the elements melded together by Franklin D. 
Roosevelt more than a half-century ago, such as blue-collar workers and Roman 
Catholics, already have defected in large measure to the Republican Party. The 
friction between blacks and Jews, Erie said, amounts to "a squabble among the 
surviving remnants of the New Deal coalition." 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House, aides to President Clinton claimed that they were 
heartened by the number of black leaders -- such as the Rev. Jesse Jackson and 
NAACP head Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. -- who have denounced Muhammad's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 But one Democratic consultant speculated that if the current tension "gets to 
be even more of an open wound," more direct action by party leaders may be 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore, who has strong ties to Jewish groups, took on the 
assignment of adding the Administration's voice to the chorus of protest, 
calling Muhammad's speech "the vilest kind of racism," in an address to the 
United Jewish Appeal earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing out that, besides castigating Jews, Muhammad had attacked the Pope, 
whites in South Africa and the mentally handicapped, Gore added: "It sickens me 
to hear it. Farrakhan should reject it." 
</P>
<P>
 But the most severe blow to Farrakhan of all was Wednesday's rejection by 
Mfume and the Black Caucus -- just as Mfume's public embrace in September was 
the biggest boost Farrakhan had received in his drive to gain respectability 
and broaden his influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Mfume said that in pledging to work with the Nation of Islam the caucus was 
trying to tap into Farrakhan's reputed ability to improve the quality of life 
among urban-core blacks by promoting the concepts of self-help and 
self-discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know full well the tremendous things the Nation of Islam has been able to 
do to bring safety to public housing projects, to create a climate of 
self-esteem among young people, to stop the killing, the violence and pain and 
to work toward economic development," Mfume said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said that Mfume is eager to preserve the appearance of unity 
among blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is tremendous pressure to present a solid front and not to be critical 
of others on our side," said Milton Morris, vice president of the Joint Center 
of Political Studies, a think tank focusing on African American affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever had prompted Mfume to declare a working partnership between the Black 
Caucus and Farrakhan, his move had alarmed many Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can work with the Black Caucus," said Jess Hordes, Washington director of 
the Anti-Defamation League. "We cannot work with Farrakhan."

COVERAGE OF OFFICIALS' PERSONAL BEHAVIOR EXCESSIVE, SURVEY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS B. ROSENSTIEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although few Americans followed Adm. Bobby Ray Inman's abrupt withdrawal from 
consideration for the defense secretary's job, many agree with his condemnation 
of the media, according to a survey released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A growing number of Americans say press coverage of politicians' personal and 
ethical behavior has become excessive and is discouraging qualified people from 
entering public life, says the survey by the Times Mirror Center for People and 
the Press. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, although a plurality of Americans think the media 
exercise more power than political leaders or other groups in setting the 
national agenda, most do not believe that the media exaggerate such national 
phenomena as the level of violent crime -- even in view of national statistics 
that indicate the crime rate is declining. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-four percent of respondents said they believe that the media accurately 
reflect violence in America, whereas only 28% think the problem is exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 A plurality of 43% described the media as the most powerful force in setting 
the national agenda, whereas 22% cited political leaders in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Surveyors interviewed 1,207 adults from Jan. 27 to Jan. 30. The poll has a 
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. In addition, the results 
could be biased by the wording of the questions. The Times Mirror Center is 
owned by Times Mirror Co., publisher of The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 In his controversial withdrawal as defense secretary-designate, Inman charged 
the press with engaging in a kind of "new McCarthyism." Public officials are 
being driven from office, he said, by a negativism in press coverage that 
distorts their records. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found that 59% of Americans think the coverage of personal and 
ethical behavior is excessive -- an increase from 52% who expressed that 
opinion in a similar poll in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 66% of the public still views the press as an important public 
watchdog, according to the survey, considerably fewer than five years ago think 
it helps weed out unfit politicians. Now only 45% see it that way, contrasted 
with 60% in 1989. By 64% to 31%, the survey found, Americans think that press 
coverage is discouraging qualified people from entering public life. 
</P>
<P>
 Those polled also said the stories they followed most closely last month were 
neither the beating of skating star Nancy Kerrigan nor the malicious-wounding 
trial of Lorena Bobbitt, but the Southern California earthquake and the Eastern 
cold snap.

 NASA began fueling the space shuttle Discovery late Wednesday for a scheduled 
4:10 a.m. PST launch today with Russian cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev and five U.S. 
astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the first time a Russian has flown on a U.S. shuttle, and the first 
joint U.S.-Russian human space mission since the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz docking. 
Both countries expect Discovery's eight-day voyage to lead to more shared 
missions and, by 2001, a shared space station.

PROBE FINDS NO BROWN BRIBE ON VIETNAM TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Justice Department on Wednesday closed its investigation into whether 
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown had taken a $700,000 bribe to facilitate 
lifting the trade embargo against Vietnam, and Brown's lawyer said that he had 
been "completely exonerated." 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno left the announcement of the action to the Commerce 
Department, which said Brown "is pleased that the inquiry has fully and fairly 
exonerated him of any wrongdoing." 
</P>
<P>
 Reno, it was learned, decided against releasing the letter to Brown's attorney 
and issuing a statement on grounds that the Justice Department does not do that 
for ordinary citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department disseminated copies of the letter from Joseph E. 
Gangloff, acting chief of Justice's public integrity section, to Reid 
Weingarten, Brown's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that it has been investigating whether Brown had improperly agreed to 
use his influence to change U.S. trade policy toward Vietnam, Gangloff's letter 
said: "We have completed a thorough investigation and have concluded that the 
evidence does not substantiate the allegation that Mr. Brown entered into any 
such agreement. No further investigation is warranted. Accordingly, we are 
closing the investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Gangloff said he appreciated "Secretary Brown's cooperation with the 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 The inquiry was initiated after Binh T. Ly, a Vietnamese American businessman 
who acknowledged that he had never met Brown, said he had been told of the 
alleged payoff scheme by a former business associate, Nguyen Van Hao. Ly said 
that Brown was to have been paid through a secret bank account in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, Brown acknowledged meeting three times with Hao -- in November 
and December, 1992, and February, 1993 -- but denied receiving money from him 
or having any kind of business relationship with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Hao, a Vietnamese businessman and former Vietnamese government official, and 
Ly, who passed an FBI polygraph examination, appeared before a federal grand 
jury in Miami that looked into the allegations, sources familiar with the 
inquiry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hao, who lives in Miami, contended that Ly made up the story after being 
forced out of a business venture with Hao. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), who had called unsuccessfully for 
appointment of an independent counsel in the case, said Wednesday that "the 
charges certainly warranted a thorough investigation. If after looking at the 
proceeding, I'm satisfied that it was an adequate investigation -- if Ron Brown 
indeed was innocent of solicitation of a bribe -- I couldn't be happier. But 
there was plenty of reason to examine the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has said he took no part in Administration deliberations about lifting 
the trade embargo. President Clinton relaxed the embargo last September, and 
the Senate last week urged him to remove it. He is expected to end the embargo 
this week.

PANEL TO STUDY CLOSING SOME OF NATIONAL LABS; RESEARCH: ENERGY SECRETARY 
O'LEARY APPEARS TO TAKE AIM AT 'BIG THREE' IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA. ALL NINE 
FACILITIES EMPLOY 19,000 SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary on Wednesday established a task force headed by 
a leading industrialist to study the nation's nine national laboratories, with 
an eye toward the possibility of closing some of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the end of the Cold War and growing concerns about global economic 
competition, now is the time to plan how the department's laboratories can best 
help meet the energy, environmental, economic, scientific and defense needs of 
the future," O'Leary said at a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The energy secretary, who has shaken up her department's nuclear weapons 
bureaucracy by calling for investigations of radiation experiments, appeared to 
take special aim at the "big three" labs traditionally engaged in nuclear 
weapons research -- all of which are important to California. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Livermore Laboratory is based in Livermore. The Los Alamos National 
Laboratory in New Mexico is administered by the University of California. And 
Sandia National Labs operate from Livermore and Albuquerque. The University of 
California system also administers a fourth national lab, the Lawrence Berkeley 
Laboratory in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary charged the task force with the responsibility of assessing whether 
the labs needlessly duplicate each other's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 While saying that she is not certain that closing any of the labs is 
necessary, she said that the issue "is certainly one that (task force members) 
should be examining and making recommendations about." She selected Motorola 
chief executive Robert W. Galvin to lead the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine national labs are owned by the department, which contracts with 
private concerns to run them. While the three major labs concentrate primarily 
on nuclear research, the network also does other energy and environmental 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 With annual budgets of more than $6 billion and employment rolls of more than 
19,000 scientists and engineers, the facilities are a potent force both in the 
nation's economy and in the communities they occupy. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary's comments Wednesday mark the first time since the establishment of 
the Energy Department in 1977 that its secretary has spoken publicly about the 
possibility of shrinking the network of laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
 The move comes at a time when many of the labs, especially those that have 
specialized in nuclear weapons design, have been reshaping their staffs and 
their research agendas to reflect the declining importance of the Energy 
Department's military research. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, all three of the labs engaged primarily in bomb design recently 
signed on to multimillion-dollar research programs in which they will cooperate 
with the nation's domestic auto makers in an effort to develop safer cars that 
meet higher emission standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooperative programs between the national labs and private industry are 
gaining new interest both from manufacturers and the Clinton Administration, 
which has been more active than its predecessors in using the powers of the 
federal government to meet the needs of American industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Other labs under examination are the Argonne National Lab in Argonne, Ill.; 
the Brookhaven National Lab in Upton, N.Y.; the Idaho National Engineering 
Laboratory in Idaho Falls, Ida.; Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, 
Tenn., and the Pacific Northwest Laboratory in Richland, Wash.

COPS TRY TO BLOW HOLES IN UCI MARKSMANSHIP STUDY; CRIMINOLOGY: EX-DEPUTY'S 
RESEARCH SHOWS THE ODDS OF POLICE HITTING THE BAD GUY HAVEN'T IMPROVED IN A 
CENTURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They aren't exactly ready to challenge UC Irvine criminologist Bryan Vila to a 
duel, but law enforcement officials think his cops-can't-shoot-straight theory 
is a little off target. 
</P>
<P>
 Vila, a one-time Los Angeles County deputy sheriff, and UCI graduate student 
Gregory Morrison have completed an intriguing, if curious, study they say 
indicates police officers today don't perform any better in gunfights than 
lawmen did 100 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Polling major law enforcement agencies across the country, Vila and Morrison 
found that a shot fired during a gun battle by today's officer struck its 
intended target, on average, 15% to 30% of the time -- the same degree of 
accuracy New Orleans police officers reported in the late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, Wyatt Earps and Dirty Harries they ain't. 
</P>
<P>
 And while today's police officers enjoy the benefits of semiautomatic weapons, 
souped-up bullets and hundreds of hours of training, New Orleans officers of 
that period toted cock-and-pull six-shooters, and received little or no 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears as if our guys today don't shoot any better than their 
counterparts in the last century," said Vila. 
</P>
<P>
 To which police here and elsewhere responded in utter disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob MacLeod, general manager of the Orange County Deputy Sheriff's Assn.: "Any 
study is only as good as the data you start with, and I'm sure in 1880 in New 
Orleans when they shot somebody, they wrote a report when they damn well wanted 
to, and if a guy missed, and he didn't report it, that would affect the 
percentages." 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Dees, publisher of "Police Marksman" magazine in Montgomery, Ala.: "How 
can that be? A hundred years ago, they didn't do any training. They'd hire 
somebody, pin a badge on 'em and say, boom, you're a deputy." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Pledger, chief of the FBI's firearms training center in Quantico, Va.: "I 
don't buy it. If I had to face an average gunman from 1894 with his equipment 
and his training, or a police officer today with his equipment and his 
training, I'd take the 1890s guy any day." 
</P>
<P>
 Vila confessed that it sounds odd, but he said the study, which included 
mathematical modeling, indicates that humans can only perform so well in 
gunfights, regardless of training or weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Morrison, who is also an ex-police officer, theorize that "it just may 
be humanly impossible to do any better than people did 100 years ago. We may be 
up against a biological limit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Vila and Morrison were marksmen when they were in law enforcement, but in 
light of their study, it is unclear what that means. 
</P>
<P>
 While the modern data came from some of the country's biggest police agencies, 
such as Los Angeles, Houston and Portland, Ore., Vila acknowledged that the 
historical data may be a little iffy, if only because it involves only one 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the only study available back then," said Vila, an assistant 
professor of criminology who is presenting the findings to UCI's School of 
Social Ecology today and is scheduled to be published in American Journal of 
Police soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at contemporary departments what you find is performances just 
like you had in New Orleans 100 years ago, and New Orleans wasn't a progressive 
department 100 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gimme a break," said Dean Moser with the National Sheriff's Assn. in 
Alexandria, Va. "A hundred years ago? That's a ringer. I'm sorry, I'm from 
Missouri, and they'd have to prove that one on me." 
</P>
<P>
 After he finished snickering, Don Blankenship, president of the Santa Ana 
Police Officers Assn., said there may be something to the study, titled 
"Biological Limits to Police Combat Handgun Shooting Accuracy." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true that the reaction of a police officer today is going to be similar 
to a police officer 100 years ago," Blankenship said. "And it's true that cops 
don't shoot as well as people think. 
</P>
<P>
 "God, I can remember that TV show where Efrem Zimbalist Jr. played an FBI 
agent and here he was on the bow of a bouncing boat with a two-inch .38 and he 
wings some guy passing by. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe he's right," Blankenship said. "I'm sort of talking myself into this." 
</P>
<P>
 Vila said his former colleagues should not take umbrage. On the contrary, he 
said, this was good news for cops, bystanders and even bad guys. If it can be 
shown that cops can only shoot so well with traditional handguns, regardless of 
the amount of training and technical wizardry, then maybe it's time to devise 
something that guarantees accuracy in the 70% to 80% range, he said. Perhaps 
some sort of laser gun a la James Bond, or "smart bullets," which, like smart 
missiles, would guide themselves -- although it's unclear how either of those 
scenarios would be better for bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I've got to be honest, I don't really care about the bad guys," Vila 
said. "I'm not talking about Buck Rogers or anything, but maybe it's time to 
explore" new options. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually," said the FBI's Pledger, "they have experimented with the concept 
of smart bullets. The problem is, cruise missiles have miles and miles to 
adjust to radar, but bullets sometimes have only five or six feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Vila said he and Morrison think further study is in order. In the meantime, he 
said they fully expected to take a few, er, potshots from their former 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what doing research is all about," Vila said. "You stand up there and 
let guys toss stones at you, and if they knock you down, you move in another 
direction."

O.C. BACKERS MOBILIZE TO SAVE HANOI EMBARGO; VIETNAM: OPPONENTS OF NORMAL TIES 
WORK TO CHANGE CLINTON'S MIND, BUT CONCEDE IT'S PROBABLY TOO LATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 From VFW posts to Little Saigon restaurants, from suburban homes to spare 
storefront offices, the opposition scrambled this week to mobilize a last-ditch 
campaign to dissuade President Clinton from lifting the trade embargo with 
Vietnam on Friday as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, the rhetorical battle over Vietnam's future has been waged by the 
fiercely loyal opposition of war widows and veterans, grieving parents and 
immigrants. But this week, passions had cooled into a half-hearted effort to 
stave off what many crusaders concede is inevitable: the end of the 19-year-old 
embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can I say?" said Chuyen Nguyen, a flamboyant activist in Little Saigon 
who ordinarily expresses his views on normalization through the mouth of a 
bullhorn. "America will do anything that will benefit America. Regardless of 
how much opposition we raise, it's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Vietnamese American groups -- which want to link normalization to 
improvements in human rights -- vowed to stage demonstrations across the 
country and Little Saigon on Saturday. Others faxed objections to the White 
House, promising to circulate petitions for free elections in Vietnam during 
the popular local Tet festivities this month in Huntington Beach and in 
Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans organizations and POW/MIA groups -- which seek a fuller accounting of 
missing servicemen before the embargo is lifted -- have been highly vocal in 
their disapproval. But their opposition has failed to produce the groundswell 
of criticism from other quarters that some White House advisers had been 
anticipating -- and to which Clinton was vulnerable politically, given his 
avoidance of military service during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people just seem to be getting tired of the issue," said a 
congressional source, adding that his office was surprised by the muted 
reaction last week when the Senate recommended in a non-binding resolution that 
Clinton lift the embargo. The source said his Senate office received the 
expected protests from the leaders of POW/MIA family groups, but only six calls 
from constituents expressing an opinion about the 62 to 38 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 That weary sense of resignation seemed to have spread even to Little Saigon, 
an Orange County community with the largest concentration of Vietnamese living 
outside Vietnam and one where the normalization issue is a litmus test of 
opposition to communism. 
</P>
<P>
 Ban Binh Bui, the newly elected president of the Vietnamese Community of 
Southern California, fired off a letter of protest to the President, emblazoned 
with a seal of a map of Vietnam. He appealed to Clinton to consider "the 70 
million people living under Communist oppression and not just American business 
firms worrying for their loss in dollars and cents." 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond the letter, Bui said there was little his group could do until 
after the President officially makes his move. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone can make a difference at this point," said Bui. "But we 
need to make our President understand that we need to link normalization with 
the issues of democracy, human rights and POWs." 
</P>
<P>
 Some family groups and veterans organizations privately acknowledge that they 
may have been slow in organizing their opposition, but said they planned to 
redouble their efforts over the next few days to persuade Clinton to maintain 
the embargo until Hanoi accounts for 2,200 servicemen still officially listed 
as missing in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Kakuk, a former Army machine-gunner and a member of Vietnam War Veterans 
of Orange County, said he was so appalled by the prospects for normalization 
that he started calling and faxing his objections to Washington. On Tuesday, he 
said, he called the office of Arizona Sen. John McCain, a former POW who has 
supported moves toward normalization, to accuse him of being a murderer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's selling out his brothers," Kakuk said. "What is his motive? Is he 
getting money out of this? It's a shame the businessmen -- all they see is 
dollar signs rolling in their eyes when they think of Vietnam. . . . Vietnam 
has a lot of minerals and a lot of oil." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the momentum of recent events, some groups are reassessing their 
strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Legion said it is urging its 3.1 million members to call or send 
telegrams to the White House protesting the decision. The National League of 
Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, the nation's 
largest POW/MIA family group, also appealed to Clinton to withhold his decision 
until the group can visit Hanoi to determine whether Vietnam is cooperating as 
fully as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with this effort some Vietnamese activists worry that it's too late. 
Or it's time to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 "If American veteran groups and families of American servicemen can't convince 
the President not to lift the embargo, then I think anything the Vietnamese 
people do will be like us screaming with no one there to listen," said Hau 
Nguyen, chairman of the Viet Nam Political Detainees Mutual Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lively Vietnamese press, many editors planned to publish their 
objections to trade normalization, according to Khoi Nguyen, president of the 
Assn. of Vietnamese Press and Media. 
</P>
<P>
 It was their way, he said, of protesting "the inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, this spirit of resignation has not prompted a number of local 
Vietnamese leaders to suddenly support trade. Indeed, Little Saigon television 
host Diem Do was still struggling yesterday to find anyone willing to debate in 
support of trade for his show, "Tuoi Tre Va Ngay Mai" (Youth and Tomorrow). 
However, there was no shortage of advocates for the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do have a couple of candidates," he said. "But they're sort of hesitant 
about speaking about it. It's such a hot issue right now and they'd rather talk 
about it in a few weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 The heat of the issue is still so intense that some Vietnamese leaders dodged 
telephone calls or declined to be quoted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lifting the embargo is a good thing, but don't quote me on that because I'm 
in hot water enough with the community," said a Vietnamese woman. "I'm so tired 
of people saying they're against it. Just you watch. After Friday, they'll be 
talking out of the other side of their mouths. They'll be quick to jump to the 
other side and use it to their advantage."

2 O.C. CONGRESSMEN SAVOR RARE WIN ON IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER and ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Rep. Ron Packard was beaming. Dana Rohrabacher, his younger, more rambunctious 
Orange County Republican colleague, was brimming with the usual combative 
flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by several other conservative California members during an upbeat 
morning news conference Wednesday in the Capitol, they were luxuriating in a 
rare moment of victory over more liberal Democratic forces that so often have 
been able to dismiss their protestations about illegal immigration as political 
posturing. 
</P>
<P>
 After some hard-headed bargaining with other Appropriations Committee members 
Tuesday, Packard (R-Oceanside), whose district includes southern Orange County, 
succeeded in attaching an amendment to the California earthquake relief package 
that would deny long-term emergency benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring a "huge, huge victory," Packard said, "This is the beginning of 
changing government policy on how we spend our social dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 It also appeared to be the curtain-raising on a more prominent Washington role 
for Packard, who has usually chosen a more behind-the-scenes persona. 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), whose controversial hard line on illegal 
immigration helped bring the proposed funding cutoff to national attention, 
also was jubilant. "The principle I have been advocating has been accepted, and 
that is that all emergency disaster relief like free rent for 18 months and 
outright grants for thousands of dollars should not be tolerated," he said 
shortly after the Appropriations Committee's vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never had any problem with giving someone very temporary emergency aid 
at the moment of need. After receiving it, illegal aliens should be sent back 
to their home country." 
</P>
<P>
 For Packard, the former Carlsbad mayor who is midway through his sixth term in 
the House and who has long been engaged in the immigration issue, his ascension 
to the powerful Appropriations Committee last year gives him increased 
visibility and clout. 
</P>
<P>
 But Packard has generally kept his focus on the issue's politically safer 
aspects, such as cracking down on illegal immigration at the border and 
pressing federal government to reimburse the state for the billions it spends 
on education, health care and other costs. 
</P>
<P>
 By taking a lead role in the attempt to restrict emergency funds to illegal 
immigrants, Packard has stepped into a political minefield. It is a move that 
he felt he had to make, but one that runs counter to his make-no-waves Capitol 
Hill pragmatism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not want to exacerbate what was already a sensitive issue," Packard 
said. "But it's the biggest issue in my district . . . the most crucial problem 
all my cities struggle with." 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to constituents last December, he vowed to add his amendment to 
every appropriations bill. 
</P>
<P>
 But Packard said he wishes some other legislation would have been the guinea 
pig. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little disappointed that this is the first bill out of the chute," he 
said. "The amendment will fit a lot better and be more acceptable to other 
members of Congress on several other appropriations bills. This is not the 
issue that I would have preferred to be the very first test." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some Republicans were surprised that the avuncular Packard, who once was 
named by a Capitol Hill newspaper to its "obscure caucus," would tackle such an 
explosive topic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is he fighting this fight? You naturally expect others to do it," said a 
veteran California Republican staffer. "He tapped into something very emotional 
and it makes you wonder if he was put up to it by some of his colleagues on the 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Others noted that he appeared awkward, even ill-prepared, when the interplay 
with committee Democrats became heated and personal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a vocal or outspoken person," Packard said. "I don't get heated up 
quickly. But when some members of committee accused me of immigrant-bashing and 
being mean-spirited, I wanted to make it clear that was not my motivation at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I represent a lot of Hispanic-surnamed families, I hired Hispanic citizens in 
my office long before I got to Congress. I have tried to learn Spanish myself, 
and two of my sons speak Spanish. One is married to a woman of Spanish 
background. I have nothing but compassion and love for them as a people, but I 
am sworn to uphold the Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite any personal unease that Packard may have felt going into the 
committee negotiations on Tuesday, he entered them with optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not surprised" by the outcome, he said. "I had talked to (California 
Democrats on the Appropriations Committee) Reps. (Esteban E.) Torres, (Julian 
C.) Dixon and (Vic) Fazio, and I knew they were anxious to move the bill. I 
thought we could reach some compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) thought the amendment language was too vague 
because it didn't spell out what emergency services -- except medical care -- 
would be offered to illegal immigrants; Rep. Ronald D. Coleman (D-Texas) 
foresaw problems in determining illegal -- or legal -- status of quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard immediately agreed to be more specific about benefits, and Dixon 
offered a compromise to keep the bill alive. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) feared the amendment would slow down 
the relief process and increase administrative costs. 
</P>
<P>
 And Rep. Jose E. Serrano (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Congressional Hispanic 
Caucus, railed: "This issue is not an honest issue. . . . This issue speaks to 
meanness, it speaks to immigrant-bashing. . . . It says that everyone who looks 
different is going to be questioned over and over and over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Coleman proposed language that would key emergency benefits to existing 
immigration laws and the U.S. Constitution. Saying the move merely clouded the 
issue, Republicans objected, but the Democrats tacked it onto the Dixon 
amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard then withdrew the entire amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fazio, Torres and Dixon huddled with Packard and Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) 
at a long table in the committee hearing room, hoping to find some middle 
ground. The Democrats wanted to avoid potentially more damaging attacks on the 
House floor by addressing the amendment in committee, while Republicans saw an 
opening to win a slightly watered-down ideological point. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres offered a revised amendment -- stripped of the Coleman language -- and 
Packard had his victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimate success depends on the outcome of the House floor debate today and 
Senate and Conference Committee actions, but Packard and his fellow Republicans 
have clearly lifted the illegal immigration issue to a new plateau. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important factor is for the message to go out to the federal 
agencies that we need a whole different mind set" in dispensing scarce federal 
relief funds, Packard said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Rohrabacher, the legislative victory gave flight to his more visceral kind 
of rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will have real impact on federal agencies' ability to put out a flyer, 
saying (to illegal immigrants), 'Come on in and get the money,' " he said. 
"We're all part of the same family, of all racial backgrounds. When you're in 
an emergency situation, what kind of person takes limited emergency resources 
from his own family and gives it to a stranger? We cannot afford to supply 
benefits for illegals without hurting our citizens and legal residents."

MANDELA MEETS WITH BIEHLS IN S. AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sister of slain American student Amy Biehl took comfort Wednesday in a hug 
from black South African leader Nelson Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just got this strength. . . . If I can be as strong as he could, we'll 
make it," Molly Biehl said after she and her mother, Linda, met the African 
National Congress president for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a truly magnificent man -- warm and a visionary. I hope he's around for 
a long time," Linda Biehl said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela said he met the Biehls with "a mixture of pain and joy," and said he 
was pleased to have been able to convey his sympathies. 
</P>
<P>
 Molly Biehl said her sister, a 26-year-old Fulbright scholar from Newport 
Beach, met Mandela a few months before she was beaten and stabbed to death by a 
black mob in Guguletu township last Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Biehl, who was white, had worked on voter education projects in 
preparation for the country's first all-race election in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Molly and Linda Biehl are in South Africa to monitor the trial of three youths 
charged with murdering Amy Biehl. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial began in November and resumed Monday after a holiday recess.

O.C. CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION ASSAILS CLINTON; REACTION: DORNAN IS HARSHEST 
CRITIC OF MOVE TOWARD NORMAL RELATIONS. BUT FERGUSON WELCOMES IT, SAYING 
CAPITALISM WILL HELP.

 President Clinton's apparent decision to lift the trade embargo against 
Vietnam was harshly protested and ridiculed Wednesday by most of Orange 
County's Republican congressmen, who claimed Clinton is forsaking the families 
of missing American servicemen and the campaign for human rights in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 While California businesses are considered best positioned for renewed trade 
with Vietnam, members of the local congressional delegation said the 
Administration is bowing to business interests and should not lift the 
sanctions until the POW/MIA issue is resolved and democratic rights are 
restored in that country. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), who has previously assailed Clinton 
for avoiding the draft during the Vietnam War, said: "We know Clinton was 
missing from Vietnam, but we need to find out what happened to the others who 
were actually there." 
</P>
<P>
 A strong counterpoint came from state Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport 
Beach), a former Marine Corps lieutenant colonel who served three tours in 
Vietnam, and one who welcomes signs of a complete thaw in relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson noted that capitalism would do what guns and bullets couldn't. 
"Coca-Cola is much more effective than an AK-47," Ferguson said. "When people 
get a taste of our good materialistic life, they don't want to fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he sees the nagging MIA issue as "a drawback" in the quest for 
normalization, Ferguson said the public must recognize that soldiers have been 
left missing in action from all wars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are different today," Ferguson said. "We didn't have this outcry when 
the North Koreans did almost the same things. They killed them, they hid them. 
We never knew what happened to many of our soldiers. This happens in every 
war." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the five out of six Orange County congressmen who commented on the expected 
reconciliation with Vietnam, Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) was the least 
critical. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that while lifting the trade embargo should be accompanied by human 
rights guarantees, he expected that free trade would speed up the release of 
information on the POW/MIA issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just returned from a rather extensive trip to China and I got the feeling 
that the more presence the U.S. has there, the more able we would be to 
encourage human rights in that country. I think the same thing applies to 
Vietnam. I don't think it's a good tactic to keep the embargo in place," 
Packard said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the general criticism from Orange County's congressmen seemed to conflict 
with their own party's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) strongly favored easing the 
trade restrictions, saying, "We ought to look . . . at the potential market. To 
delay and delay and delay, we're simply going to be preempted by others." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Dornan, who is president of the American chapter of the 
International Committee for a Free Vietnam, reiterated his opposition Wednesday 
in a letter to the White House, in which he stated that the embargo "has 
yielded cooperation and information that otherwise we would not have attained." 
</P>
<P>
 Other local representatives agreed the embargo is the best tool the United 
States has to pressure the Vietnamese government to provide POW/MIA information 
and the political guarantees the United States is seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the very least, we should try to make free elections a provision" before 
lifting the embargo, said Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton), a member of the House 
Asian and Pacific Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to resume trade with Vietnam before missing U.S. servicemen are 
accounted for is "totally premature," said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington 
Beach). "There's a lot of information that needs to be released. They have not, 
for example, provided the records from the prisons in which our own prisoners 
were kept." 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher said the Clinton Administration should also force the Vietnamese 
government to release its own political prisoners before the trade restrictions 
are lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) said that while the move will create 
new business ventures for American firms, including many in California, the 
United States will have many opportunities to trade with Vietnam, but only this 
one chance to strike a good deal to achieve more freedom for the Vietnamese 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox cited recent studies showing that Vietnam is one of the world's worst 
violators of human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reversal (in America's policy toward Vietnam) is essentially free to the 
government of Vietnam. They have not even been asked to change their human 
rights policy. We are simply ignoring the human rights dimension of a healthy 
foreign policy," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the six congressmen who represent Orange County, only Rep. Jay C. Kim 
(R-Diamond Bar) did not respond to a request for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's message to the veterans' groups and the Vietnamese-American 
community, Dornan claimed, is, "Drop dead!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill Clinton was wrong about Vietnam in 1969, and he's wrong about Vietnam 
now," Dornan said. "I guess Clinton still whistles to himself 'Ho, Ho, Ho Chi 
Minh.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Cox also said that by initiating free trade with Vietnam, "the Clinton 
Administration has seemingly turned a deaf ear to the concerns of California's 
Vietnamese community." 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the trade agreement argue that in addition to new business 
opportunities, America needs to close the book on its involvement in the war 
that caused bitterness at home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time for us to close this chapter in American history and in America's 
relations with Vietnam, no doubt about it," Rohrabacher said. "But before you 
close this chapter, we have to write the final paragraphs, and the Vietnamese 
are withholding information."

O.C. BUSINESS COMMUNITY, TRADE EXPERTS LAUD DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County trade experts and business people, including many in the 
Vietnamese community, on Wednesday applauded news that the Clinton 
Administration apparently will lift the 19-year embargo on commerce with 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm interested in exploring the opportunities," said Lloyd Tran, a Vietnamese 
immigrant who is president of Biomed Healthcare in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran said that Vietnam, with a population of more than 70 million, vitally 
needs health care products and is a logical trading partner for a company like 
his, which sells medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is particularly well-positioned to take advantage of new trade 
opportunities because of the large number of Vietnamese entrepreneurs in Little 
Saigon and elsewhere who maintain family and business contacts in their native 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Trade Assn. of Orange County and several other organizations and 
government agencies stand ready to help potential exporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of scrambling" in anticipation of the embargo's end, said 
Thomas Horton, marketing director for the World Trade Assn. of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has seen 30 or 40 membership applications recently from Vietnamese 
Americans who want to join the group so they can meet other business people 
seeking trade opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Hoffman, western regional director of the federal Bureau of Export 
Administration, said, "I would anticipate a significant amount of interest, and 
our office will be around to assist." 
</P>
<P>
 Companies have been allowed to negotiate deals with Vietnam but cannot carry 
out any transactions unless and until the embargo is lifted. That restriction 
has not stopped them from laying the groundwork. 
</P>
<P>
 A Huntington Beach group that wants to build hospitals in Hanoi and Saigon has 
been negotiating for months in anticipation of a change in U.S. government 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're ready to go," said Les Hufford, executive director of the Real Estate 
Medical Investment and Trade group, which is putting together the hospital 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 All the agreements are in place with the Vietnamese government, he said 
Wednesday, and the company is close to lining up $10 million in financing, 
perhaps as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Open trade with Vietnam is overdue, he said, because other industrialized 
nations have already been selling products and services there. "The only one 
being hurt by the embargo is the American businessman," he said.

NO SURRENDER; FOR SOME, WAR WILL NEVER END UNTIL MIAS ARE HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Barbara Robertson can't let the past rest. 
</P>
<P>
 She's tired of waiting, tired of having her hopes whipped up only to be 
dashed, and tired of wishing that her husband -- an Air Force pilot missing in 
action in the Vietnam War since 1966 -- will come home. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Robertson, a 62-year-old activist pushing for the return of American 
prisoners taken captive during the war, is up in arms about the U.S. 
government's plan to resume trade with Vietnam. She fears it will erase any 
chance of seeing her husband again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid with normalization, there's going to be no one out there fighting 
anymore," said Robertson, a Santa Ana homemaker and mother of four. "People out 
there don't know what what it's like to have a husband who may be alive or dead 
-- but nobody gives a damn." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many family members, friends and comrades-in-arms left carrying the 
banner of those lost or missing in action, Robertson can't forget the war and 
its human toll. The imminent thaw in business relations has these survivors 
passionately discussing, if not agreeing, how the move will affect an American 
psyche still scarred by losses more than 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Kakuk, for one, is fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
 Kakuk, a U.S. Army machine-gunner who served in Vietnam in 1968, called the 
White House this week to say President Clinton is "selling families down the 
river." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in basic training, they told us, 'We never leave our men behind,' 
" said Kakuk, 47, of Huntington Beach. "Just think of the families. And here 
the government is saying, 'Let's put it all behind us,' but it's not right. Why 
should we just write MIAs and POWs off the planet?" 
</P>
<P>
 Kakuk said the war consumes him to this day. He still has flashbacks, 
especially when he sees a diesel truck or a helicopter. He visits local schools 
to tell young people about the war, recently joined protesters outside the 
Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda and founded a group called the Vietnam War 
Veterans of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The retired landscaper, like many of those casting a cynical eye toward the 
lifting of sanctions, said money has taken the place of principle in the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Businessmen . . . all they see is dollar signs rolling in their eyes when 
they think of Vietnam," Kakuk said. "Vietnam has a lot of minerals and a lot of 
oil there." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Fox, another Vietnam veteran, said he'll never forget the war. His 
wheelchair is a daily reminder: The 45-year-old Lakewood resident and onetime 
Marine Corps radio operator was wounded and left paralyzed at Khe Sanh, one of 
the hardest-fought battles of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is ready to talk about healing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't agree with everything that's happened, with the cover-up of MIAs," 
Fox said. "But 20 years later, it's time to put things behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, president of the California Paralyzed Veterans Assn., volunteers at the 
Veterans Administration Hospital in Long Beach to help his fellow soldiers 
recover. More than 100 Orange County veterans use the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Few remain from his own company, he said. Most were "wiped out" in the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vietnam is something that, except for the people who've carried the banner of 
POWs or MIAs, has fallen to the wayside," Fox said. "The veteran isn't in the 
public eye." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox favors lifting the embargo. "But I would hope Clinton would look at his 
cards and make sure that before he lifts this embargo he has something to play 
his hand with," Fox said. "We should have open communications, and have a team 
that could look into the possibilities of MIAs. We should open every avenue to 
bring them back." 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam veteran Robert Key, director of the Veterans Center in Anaheim, said 
he can see both sides of the debate, but added: "We can still have bad feelings 
about that time in our life, without trying pretend that the country doesn't 
exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana's Robertson isn't ready to let go of the bad feelings -- or the hope 
that with increased political leverage, U.S. officials could bring her husband 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone would survive, my husband could," said Robertson, whose spouse was 
an avid mountain climber. "Any time a family works this hard to bring him home 
27 years later, he must have some special qualities." 
</P>
<P>
 "We just can't ignore the chance that our men are still alive."

THE FED IS WATCHED WITH INTEREST; MORTGAGE RATES UP ON FEARS OF A BOOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fears that federal regulators may soon push up short-term interest rates have 
prompted lenders in Southern California to raise their fixed mortgage rates by 
as much as half a percentage point and are forcing many people to rethink their 
investment strategies, financial experts said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm already getting calls from investors, saying, 'What am I going to do now 
that interest rates are going up?' " said Tom Gau, a financial planner in 
Torrance. "Some people are downright frantic." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated before Congress this 
week that the nation's central bank may raise short-term interest rates to keep 
the economy from overheating. But he did not say when the Fed might act. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said Wednesday that its chief gauge of future economic 
activity jumped again in December and that sales of new homes rose strongly, 
suggesting to some economists that the Fed will boost rates sooner rather than 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that as long as we see economic statistics coming on 
strongly, the market will have to adjust for an imminent Fed move," said Dan 
Seto, an economist at Nikko Securities Co. International in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The uncertainty has consumers scrambling to figure out how rising rates would 
affect their credit card debt, mortgage loans and savings accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers with adjustable-rate credit cards would probably be among the first 
to be hurt by a rise in short-term rates, analysts say, because their payments 
would rise almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Car buyers could feel the pinch next, because many auto loans are tied to 
short-term rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors who recently took out long-term certificates of deposit would also 
suffer if rates rose, because inflation would eat up even more of their modest 
earnings.  
</P>
<P>
 Although some investors are clearly nervous about the prospects of further 
rate increases, there has been no broad selloff of stocks. Bond prices plunged 
after Greenspan made his remarks, but the market settled down Wednesday and 
recouped some of its losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term rates could climb another quarter to half a point and still remain 
relatively low. If a rise in rates slows the economy and actually prolongs the 
recovery, it could extend the long rally in the stock market, said David Holt, 
director of technical research at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stock market is still the only game in town," Holt said. "It's hard to 
find a reason not to be in equities." 
</P>
<P>
 Some cautious investors who have certificates of deposit about to mature say 
they will park their cash in interest-bearing money market funds for a while, 
until the direction of interest rates comes a little more into focus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a high roller, but I'll be damned if I'm going to renew my CD for 
another six months if I don't have a good idea of where interest rates are 
going to go," said Donald Kravitz, a semi-retired sales clerk in Fullerton who 
has a $5,000 certificate of deposit that will mature next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Borrowers who have applied for loans to buy new homes or refinance existing 
mortgages are also in a quandary. 
</P>
<P>
 Most lenders have raised their rates by about a quarter of a percentage point 
since Monday, and a few have lifted rates by as much as half a point. 
</P>
<P>
 Rates on fixed, 30-year loans were averaging about 6.8% just a week ago, but 
they climbed to nearly 7% by Wednesday, according to Mortgage News Co., a Santa 
Ana-based company that tracks loans offered by 130 Southern California lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase has added about $20 to the monthly payment on a $150,000 loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of borrowers are figuring that rates are a lot more likely to go up 
than down, so they've decided to stop playing the guessing game and are locking 
their rates in now," said Bob Sheets, a mortgage broker and co-owner of Golden 
West Mortgage Co. in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts said the latest rate run-up could trigger yet another round of 
refinancings, as borrowers who have postponed replacing higher-rate mortgages 
finally take the plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 But some mortgage brokers and lenders say refinancing can't be done as quickly 
as it could a month ago, because many financial institutions and appraisers 
have been swamped with earthquake-related work.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: HORACE GREELEY HAD IT ALL WRONG: GO EAST, YOUNG 
ENTREPRENEUR!

<P>
 The Japanese don't know it yet but they're about to experience an 
unprecedented explosion of entrepreneurship. They can thank their economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's Economic Planning Agency reports that the index of consumer 
confidence is the lowest it's been in 19 years. U.S. trade envoy Mickey Kantor 
is in town to pressure the Hosokawa government to broaden market access. 
Practically every week, Japanese companies with proud traditions of lifetime 
employment humbly announce major restructurings and layoffs. The same 
University of Tokyo-trained civil servants who had zealously supervised one of 
the world's most regulated economies are now grasping the nettle of 
deregulation as essential to economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 This bleak litany of Japan's corpocratic woes is excellent news for 
entrepreneurs. All the elements are clicking into place for the sort of 
"creative destruction" -- the expression articulated by Joseph Schumpeter, the 
patron economist of entrepreneurship -- that can rejuvenate a stagnant economy. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say that a new generation of entrepreneurs is poised to topple 
today's Sonys, Matsushitas, Toyotas or Mitsubishis. But it's become clear that 
a rising level of economic dissatisfaction is causing people to look beyond 
traditional efforts to simply try to improve existing business institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a sense of crisis in Japan's current economy," acknowledges a senior 
official at Japan's influential Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 
"And we recognize that there are certain structural problems. (This lack of) 
entrepreneurship is a big problem. . . . Intel and Microsoft took over for IBM 
when it stumbled. But who in Japan takes over for Fujitsu or NEC?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, MITI has spent more than a decade trying -- and failing -- to 
promote new business formation. Apparently, bureaucrats who regulate global 
enterprises have trouble giving birth to entrepreneurs. What's more, why rock 
the boat during a rising tide? In the 1980s, it was easier to make money 
playing the stock market and real estate game than actually launching a new 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 But in terms of sheer entrepreneurial resources, Japan is superbly positioned 
in high technology, venture capital and business expertise. As for 
entrepreneurial successes, there's a reason why Matsushita, Toyota and Honda 
have the names they do. In fact, Sony's Akio Morita and Kyocera's Kazuo Inamori 
are probably more global, more innovative and more entrepreneurial than most of 
their Silicon Valley counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's also no secret that Japan's business culture and administrative 
infrastructures have long been biased against start-ups, spin-offs and new 
entrants to a marketplace. If top graduates of leading universities don't go 
into government, they're expected to join top-tier companies such as Sumitomo 
and Mitsui. To this very day, most university graduates hired by leading 
companies fully expect to be employed for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Until very recently, job hopping between corporations was regarded as a 
psychological aberration. Getting a keiretsu -- a business group -- to buy an 
innovative new product from a start-up or the spin-off of a traditional company 
is still extraordinarily difficult. Indeed, Kyocera's Inamori likes to point 
out that he had to first sell his semiconductor packages to Texas Instruments 
before any Japanese companies would pay attention to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, however, words such as kigyo -- for entrepreneurship -- rather 
than keiretsu are slipping into business conversations. The stresses and 
strains of an economy in recession -- along with a population that seems 
increasingly frustrated by the political chicanery and regulatory corruption 
that appear to have slowed a general rise in their standard of living -- are 
changing Japan's conversations about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more, Japan's businessmen say they are now going to make business by 
themselves," observes the MITI official. "They recognize the problems of the 
Japanese economy and they want to become more entrepreneurial. They're looking 
for some dreams. . . . When I talk with young business people, they say they 
are now looking to leave large companies they work for." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, most of that is just talk. But the burst "bubble economy" and the 
declining rates of return on traditional investments inevitably mean that a 
growing number of bright, energetic and ambitious Japanese now have more 
incentive than ever before to launch new ventures. Deregulation reduces market 
barriers. Companies desperate to reduce costs are more willing to test a new 
supplier. Retrenchment makes it harder for companies to promote the young 
managers it wants to keep. Older managers are being cherry-picked to join the 
Japanese affiliates of what were once American, Korean and Taiwanese start-ups. 
More and more Japanese seem prepared to explore their options if the price is 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, both MITI and the Ministry of Finance are discussing how to create new 
stock exchanges to build a better venture capital infrastructure for new 
enterprise. Needless to say, these exchanges could bring about more foreign 
investment in Japanese innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there is no certainty that a rising population of entrepreneurs 
will effectively transform Japan: There are always more failures than 
successes. What's more, Japanese entrepreneurship -- just like Japanese 
capitalism -- is likely to have its own unique features. For example, it's 
quite possible that spin-offs from large companies striving to manage costs 
while pursuing new market opportunities might be a more likely scenario for the 
future of Japanese venture capital than slavish imitation of the Silicon Valley 
start-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Small companies have always played an important role in Japan's economy, but 
there has never been a more propitious time for new enterprises to proliferate. 
Japan's ability to grow vibrant new businesses -- not merely its ability to 
more cleverly restructure its older, larger ones -- may be the true measure of 
how well the country's economy can navigate the decade.

HOSOKAWA TO PUSH $49-BILLION TAX CUT TO SPUR JAPAN ECONOMY; ASIA: PRIME 
MINISTER ALSO ANNOUNCES HIKE IN CONSUMPTION TAX TO 7%, WHICH THREATENS TO CAUSE 
DOMESTIC POLITICAL CHAOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa early today announced a $49-billion 
income tax cut to kick-start Japan's foundering economy, but a new welfare levy 
to finance it could irreparably shatter his fragile ruling coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax reduction has long been urged by Japan's industrial and trading 
partners to combat Japan's worst recession in two decades. The United States 
has made a Japanese tax cut one of the key points in its campaign to open up 
Japan's markets to American products. The tax cut measure is the centerpiece of 
an estimated $140-billion stimulus package that will be announced later today 
and will require approval by Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 But a new, 7% "people's welfare tax" on goods and services, to replace the 3% 
consumption tax in April, 1997, drew sharp opposition from the Socialists. It 
may lead to political chaos just days before Hosokawa's Feb. 11 summit with 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomiichi Murayama, Socialist Party chairman, hinted that all six Socialist 
ministers would resign from the Cabinet in protest and that the party may leave 
the coalition. He also said it would be "very difficult" to win support from 
Socialists for next year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The Socialists wanted to finance the tax reduction with deficit-financing 
bonds, an idea adamantly opposed by the conservative Finance Ministry. The idea 
to basically rename the consumption tax and increase it from 3% to 7% was 
reportedly pushed by Ichiro Ozawa, leader of the Japan Renewal Party. 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden manner in which it was announced -- in the wee hours of the morning 
-- was criticized not only by the Socialists but also members of Hosokawa's 
Japan New Party and New Party Harbinger members. Critics also said the 
government should have first looked for ways to cut expenses before seeking a 
tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese stocks gave up early gains in today's trading on concern that the 
government coalition may fall apart. The benchmark Nikkei index lost 124.72 
points to 20,125.31 during midday trading. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen welcomed the move, while 
awaiting its details. "I am pleased that Japan has come forward with a program 
to stimulate the economy, including a reduction in the income tax," he said in 
a statement. "This is a step in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials have long pushed Japan to cut taxes to 
stimulate consumer spending and help shave Japan's politically nettlesome 
$50-billion trade surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 But how much the tax cut will stimulate the economy is in question. Japanese 
consumers may decide to save the tax windfall instead of spend it, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobuya Nemoto, an economist with Nomura Research Institute, called the tax cut 
"a little disappointing." He said most economists had expected a larger cut of 
$65 billion. Because the present tax reduction will be offset three years later 
by a consumption tax increase, the net effect will be a $28-billion tax 
increase, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he estimated the total stimulus package would boost the gross national 
product by 1.4%, with an effect on par with earlier packages in August, 1992, 
and April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Masamichi Omori, an economist with Daiwa Research Institute, forecast a modest 
stimulative effect and said consumption would "stabilize the economy and make 
the basis for an autonomous recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa said the cut was not geared simply to stimulate the economy but also 
to reform the tax system in the face of Japan's aging population. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan is aging faster than any nation in the world, and policy-makers have 
been scrambling to adjust to the changes by making government revenues less 
dependent on income taxes. Raising more revenue through consumption rather than 
income taxes will help insulate the national treasury when the number of 
retirees begins to mount. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current tax system is preponderantly based on personal income, and the 
burden on workers is large," Hosokawa said.  
</P>
<P>
 Television commentators noted that the normally polished Hosokawa appeared 
weak and ill-at-ease during his news conference, and they speculated that he 
was over his head on economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax package represents the latest slap at the Socialists, the seven-party 
coalition's single largest group. Earlier decisions to open Japan's rice market 
and enact a political reform package over Socialist opposition infuriated party 
members. But Murayama and other leaders put up with the slights to maintain 
coalition unity. The tax increase, however, looks likely to prove the final 
straw. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Socialists bolt from the coalition, Hosokawa will be forced to rely on 
the opposition Liberal Democratic Party to help enact the budget, complete the 
reform package and other key policies.

THE FED IS WATCHED WITH INTEREST; INDICATORS CONTINUE TO RISE AS HOME SALES 
SOAR 
</P>

<P>
 The government's chief gauge of future economic activity surged again in 
December and sales of new homes rose to near record levels, the Commerce 
Department said Wednesday, raising hopes that the economic expansion will 
continue well into the first half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time, the two reports fueled fears that banking regulators may 
push short-term interest rates up soon in an effort to cool the economy and 
keep inflation in check. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said its index of leading indicators, which forecasts 
economic trends six to nine months ahead, climbed for a fifth straight month in 
December, up 0.7% after a 0.5% gain in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The cumulative increase for the five months was 2.5%, the best showing since a 
6% rise over seven months in 1983 when the nation was emerging from its worst 
slump since the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Three straight moves by the index in one direction are considered a good -- 
though not foolproof -- sign of where the economy will be moving in the next 
six to nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate report on sales of new homes, the department said that in 
December homes were sold at the briskest pace in nearly eight years, shooting 
up by 11.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 862,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheap interest rates fired home buyer interest, especially in 1993's closing 
quarter, and bolstered the broad-based leading indicators index by pushing 
consumer expectations higher in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting the reports came on Groundhog Day, Robert Dederick of the Northern 
Trust Co. in Chicago said: "These statistics suggest that when the economists 
came out and looked at the numbers, they saw springtime. We aren't going to hit 
a brick wall, weather permitting." 
</P>
<P>
 "This rebound in sentiment demonstrates that, after being buffeted by 
stagnation and recession, consumer optimism is beginning to grow once again," 
Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer purchases of goods and services fuel about two-thirds of national 
economic activity, so more optimism is a bulwark for continuing growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Private economists welcomed the brisk economic momentum at 1994's beginning 
but cautioned that stimulus from key sectors like housing will moderate and 
also noted that price pressures are rising. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be difficult to sustain this level of activity in housing," said 
Michael Carliner, an economist with the National Assn. of Home Builders. "I'm 
not even sure that we could build houses at this pace." 
</P>
<P>
 During all of 1993, the number of new homes actually sold rose 9.7% to 669,000 
from 610,000 in 1992 -- the highest sales in five years since 676,000 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 That drained the supply of new homes for sale to the lowest in more than 20 
years. Only 4.5 months' worth of finished homes were available at December's 
sales pace, down from 4.8 months' worth of homes in November and the smallest 
inventory since 4.1 months in July, 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Carliner pointed out "a lot of upward pressure on prices," especially from 
higher costs to buy lumber, gypsum wallboard, insulation and land on which to 
build houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the same pressures were evident in December's leading index because 
the main positive influence on it after rising consumer expectations was higher 
commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
 In total, eight of the 11 separate measures in the leading index gained from 
November levels. Two weakened and one -- the average workweek -- was the same 
in both November and December. 
</P>
<P>
 Economist Marilyn Schaja of Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp. in 
New York said rising prices that affected the leading index also were evident 
in Tuesday's report from the Assn. of Purchasing Management, which showed 
factory business on the rise in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NAPM index is indicating that inflation may be heating up a bit," Schaja 
said. Index of Leading Indicators

THE COST OF A CURE; AIDS-RESEARCH INVESTING FALLS AS OPTIMISM DROPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard J. Trauger, chief scientist at Immune Response Corp., went to the 
international AIDS conference in Berlin last June to deliver what he thought 
was good news: promising results from clinical trials of the company's 
anti-AIDS therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking with scientists and investors, he described how the Carlsbad, Calif., 
firm co-founded by Dr. Jonas Salk had achieved some success with a treatment 
that aims to boost the immune system of people infected with the HIV virus. He 
was mystified when people seemed discouraged by what they heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "People had such overly optimistic expectations about our research," Trauger 
said, "that when we presented our results, they couldn't help but be 
disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 Immune Response is one of dozens of biotechnology companies -- many of them in 
California -- facing tough times in their drive to discover effective 
treatments for the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, investors rushed to companies like Immune Response in the 
hope that science would soon find a vaccine or cure for the fatal disease. But 
that optimism has waned as some promising avenues of research have hit 
dead-ends amid a growing realization that the battle to conquer AIDS will be a 
long one. 
</P>
<P>
 Start-up biotechnology companies involved in AIDS research are having a hard 
time raising capital. Many more established firms have formed joint ventures 
with major pharmaceutical firms -- also heavily involved in AIDS research -- to 
help finance their research efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Some biotech executives warn that if the investment climate does not improve 
soon, some companies will be forced to cut back or even abandon AIDS-related 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 There are numerous reasons why investor interest in AIDS is softening, company 
officials and others say. After a decade of research, only a few drugs have 
reached the market, and there is growing disenchantment about the effectiveness 
of once-promising treatments like AZT. Also, the biotechnology industry in 
general has suffered as the hype about potential wonder drugs has often 
exceeded the reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, many say, the threat of federal health care reform is throwing a wet 
blanket over the ability of all biotech companies to raise private capital. The 
biotechnology industry has complained bitterly about aspects of President 
Clinton's reform plan that would give the government more leverage to control 
prices of "breakthrough" drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a great deal of hesitancy to invest" in AIDS research, says Martin 
Delaney, founding director of Project Inform, an AIDS treatment information and 
lobbying organization in San Francisco. "The promise of quick profits is not as 
realistic as everyone once thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles J. Cashion, Immune Response's chief financial officer, says bluntly: 
"HIV treatment companies have fallen out of favor." 
</P>
<P>
 In response, many companies have stopped using AIDS as an investment-stalking 
horse and instead are emphasizing how their products can be used to treat 
cancer or other diseases. Immune Response, for example, is also working on 
treatments for liver disease, hepatitis and rheumatoid arthritis, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustration over the lack of progress in fighting AIDS prompted 15 
pharmaceutical companies, led by giant Merck & Co., to announce last year that 
they would pool research in the field to help speed the drug-development 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 The frustration grew more acute at the AIDS conference in Berlin last June. 
Just before the meeting, a research report based on studies in England, France 
and Ireland found that AZT, manufactured by Burroughs Wellcome Co., did not 
necessarily prolong life when used prior to the onset of AIDS symptoms.  
</P>
<P>
 "The leading drugs are waning, and there is a lack of unanimity on the next 
round of promising drugs," said Dr. Brandon Fradd, senior biotechnology analyst 
at Montgomery Securities, a San Francisco investment firm. Fradd and others say 
financiers have already poured millions into AIDS research companies and are 
reluctant to do more until they see the fruits of that investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you came to me today and said 'I've found a new way to go after the AIDS 
virus,' I'd have a hard time funding your company," said Richard Schneider, a 
general partner with Domain Associates, a biotech investment firm in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies most likely to be affected by the chill in the investment 
climate are start-up firms with a good idea but little money, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are a bright company and have ideas, you would have a very difficult 
time," said one Washington consultant for biotechnology firms.  
</P>
<P>
 Only three antiviral drugs -- AZT, DDI and DDC -- have been approved by the 
Food and Drug Administration. All are expensive and have toxic side effects. 
Many other treatments that use different approaches for fighting the virus are 
in various stages of development. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-four companies now have 103 AIDS medicines either in human clinical 
trials or awaiting FDA approval, according to the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers 
Assn. Of that number, 11 medicines are in review at the FDA, and 23 are in the 
last stage of clinical trials, known as Phase III. 
</P>
<P>
 The HIV therapy under joint development by Immune Response and its partner, 
French drug maker Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc., is one of the furthest along of the 
potential vaccines. It involves a vaccine that is actually an AIDS virus whose 
outer, protective "envelope" has been stripped away with chemicals and whose 
inner core has been inactivated with radiation. The approach, originally 
proposed by polio vaccine inventor Salk, is designed to enhance a person's 
natural immune system to help combat the infection without using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Immune Response's Cashion said his company -- whose stock hit a high of $62 in 
November, 1991 -- may not have been able to afford the high cost of bringing 
its HIV treatment through clinical trials without the help of Rhone-Poulenc, a 
company with $4 billion in annual sales. It can cost up to $200 million to get 
a drug through the federal approval process. 
</P>
<P>
 Fradd, the Montgomery Securities analyst, said investor interest in 
AIDS-research companies will probably perk up if a new treatment is approved by 
the FDA. The last big boost in the stock prices of AIDS-research companies came 
in late 1991, after basketball star Magic Johnson announced that he was 
infected with the HIV virus. Reacting to the News 
</P>
<P>
 Immune Response's stock fluctuated sharply since the company went public in 
May, 1990, reflecting the general volatility among biotechnology stocks, 
particularly those of AIDS research firms.

 Investment Expert Gets Jail Term for Lying: Michael Borlinghaus, a former 
principal at the New York firm of Frost & Sullivan, was sentenced to five 
months in jail for lying to federal securities regulators about an 
insider-trading scheme, according to a statement from the U.S. attorney in 
Manhattan. Borlinghaus also received five months of home confinement and 300 
hours of community service.According to the statement, a paralegal assistant at 
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, a prominent New York law firm, provided 
inside information to his roommate, Darrin Gleeman, who then passed it on to 
his father. The elder Gleeman conveyed the information to a co-worker at IBM, 
Edwin Karger. He in turn told Borlinghaus. Borlinghaus, 45, acting on behalf of 
Karger and others, used the information to buy stocks, acting through secret 
accounts in Europe, the release said.

AMERICANS SAID BETTER OFF THAN KEY RATE SHOWS; SAVINGS: CONFERENCE BOARD REPORT 
SAYS FOCUSING ON WHAT PEOPLE SOCK AWAY IS MISLEADING AS A MEASURE OF HOUSEHOLD 
WEALTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans have a greater store of wealth than what is suggested by the 
government's paltry saving estimate, a new study by the Conference Board shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Often near the bottom in international surveys of saving rates, the government 
figures Americans sock away just $4.20 of every $100 they earn, a 4.2% savings 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
 But consumers have actually witnessed a sharp rise in the value of real and 
financial assets they own, making the government figure misleading, said Albert 
Sommers, senior economic adviser at the board and author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is that the personal saving rate says little or nothing about the 
actual condition of the household sector that is presumed to be doing the 
saving," Sommers wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Several problems with the saving rate emerge, not the least of which is that 
it measures the difference between total spending and after-tax personal 
income. 
</P>
<P>
 It fails to capture the appreciation of real and financial assets that can 
often have a powerful influence on household wealth and spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the conventional measurement, the U.S. saving rate of 4.2% falls well 
short of Japan's 15.4% and Germany's 13.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 While the measured U.S. personal saving rate is about $200 billion a year, 
Sommers notes that total financial assets of American households now appear to 
be an astounding $15.5 trillion. When it comes to net financial worth -- 
financial assets, less debt -- Americans have close to $10 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
 If one uses comparable data for other countries, the United States comes out 
well ahead in savings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ratio of net financial wealth to disposable income is substantially 
higher in the U.S. than in any of the other G-7 countries," Sommers said. The 
Group of Seven industrialized countries includes Britain, Canada, France, 
Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past several years, a period characterized by a growing sense of doubt 
and pessimism over America's competitive position in the global economy, U.S. 
households chalked up impressive investment returns. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1991 to 1993, individuals invested about $270 billion in net new 
securities purchases and saw their investment portfolios rise in value by a 
whopping $1.85 trillion, the study notes. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift by consumers out of low-yielding bank deposits and into mutual funds 
has played an important role in the investment gains and highlights yet another 
shortcoming with the narrowly focused personal saving rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "For these reasons, among others, the change in the total financial net worth 
of the household sector has been very much larger than is implied by the simple 
saving rate," Sommers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from casting doubt on the usefulness of the way savings are reported, 
the study has implications for U.S. growth prospects as well. 
</P>
<P>
 While economists generally focus on income and jobs growth as key determinants 
of consumer spending, personal wealth also plays a role. 
</P>
<P>
 "The low personal saving rate does not, by itself, suggest that personal 
outlays for consumption . . . are bound to be weak in the future," Sommers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wealth is a very important determinant of spending and often outweighs the 
personal saving rate and some other elements included in the national income 
accounts."

 Court Rejects GM Claims Against VW: The German car maker won a round in its 
feud with General Motors Corp., but the controversial executive at the center 
of the struggle, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, is still far from claiming 
victory. A Frankfurt civil court judge rejected claims from GM's Adam Opel 
subsidiary, which had charged that Volkswagen won an unfair competitive 
advantage by hiring seven GM managers after Lopez left GM last March to join 
VW. Lopez remains the focus of extensive investigations stemming from 
allegations of industrial espionage in connection with his move to VW.

DRUG TO BOOST MILK OUTPUT SET FOR SALE; BIOTECHNOLOGY: WHILE IT MAY NOT BE A 
BLOCKBUSTER FOR MONSANTO, IT IS EXPECTED TO BE A KEY TEST OF CONSUMER REACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K. H. WALTERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Monsanto Corp. on Friday will begin selling a synthetic drug for cows that can 
lead to significant increases in milk production, thus opening a crucial new 
chapter in the arduous and controversial development of genetically engineered 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug, to be marketed under the brand name Posilac, is not expected to be a 
blockbuster for the St. Louis-based company. But the way consumers react to its 
use could set the tone for the planned introduction of a wide range of foods 
designed in biotechnology laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
 The vocal opponents of Posilac, a genetically engineered form of a naturally 
occurring substance called bovine somatotropin, or BST, hope to add to a list 
of creameries and retailers that have already pledged not to carry dairy 
products derived from the milk of cows treated with the supplement. 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrations, including milk-dumping protests, are scheduled for today in a 
dozen cities nationwide, including West Hollywood. The critics claim that BST 
is unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sale of BST was approved by the Food and Drug Administration last year, but 
was delayed by a moratorium included in last year's budget bill. The moratorium 
expires today.  
</P>
<P>
 The introduction of BST is not likely to produce any immediate changes in 
either the availability or price of milk and other dairy products. Scientists 
in and out of government say consumers will not see any difference between milk 
from treated or untreated cows and that repeated studies have shown there is 
none. 
</P>
<P>
 However, depending on how widely BST is accepted by dairy farmers, experts 
have said it could speed up a trend toward fewer but larger dairy farms that 
has been transforming the dairy landscape over the last 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Many dairy farmers view BST mainly as an economic issue. In the Midwestern 
heartland of the dairy industry, which already lags California in per-cow milk 
production and implementation of technological advances, farmers worry that 
failure to use the supplement will only increase their disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, California is expected to cement its status as the No. 1 dairy 
state, achieved for the first time last September and knocking longtime leader 
Wisconsin for an ego-deflating loop. 
</P>
<P>
 But the opposition campaign, led by longtime biotechnology foe Jeremy Rifkin 
of the Washington-based Foundation on Economic Trends, has succeeded in putting 
many farmers and consumers on edge with its claim that milk from BST-treated 
cows presents a "serious public health risk" -- a claim forcefully rejected by 
the FDA when it approved the use of Posilac. 
</P>
<P>
 Monsanto said it will begin accepting orders from farmers today. Delivery of 
the drug will be immediate, the company said, but it cannot be used until nine 
weeks into a cow's lactation cycle (which begins after calving), making its 
introduction in a dairy herd gradual. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rifkin said again Wednesday that BST, by spurring cows to produce more milk, 
could lead to a greater incidence of infections in the animals, resulting in 
greater use of antibiotics and thus greater residues of antibiotics in milk. 
The federal government sets and is supposed to monitor acceptable levels of 
antibiotic residues. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration in West Hollywood today is scheduled to take place at a 
Pavilions supermarket on Santa Monica Boulevard. A spokeswoman for Vons, parent 
company of Pavilions, said the firm was not aware of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Vons said it has not taken a position on the use of BST.

 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * Stocks rallied late Wednesday, pushing some key market indexes to new highs, 
as optimism about the economy overcame fears about higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * The bond market stabilized after Tuesday's surge in interest rates. The 
Treasury announced plans to raise $40 billion via new bond sales next week, as 
expected. Stocks 
</P>
<P>
 The market dragged for much of the day before a late buying wave assured a 
higher close. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials added 11.53 points to 3,975.54, just short of Monday's 
record high of 3,978.36. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some broader indexes hit new highs: The Standard & Poor's 500 
gained 2.38 points to a record 482.00, and the New York Stock Exchange 
composite rose 1.27 points to a record 267.71. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners topped losers 13 to 8 on the NYSE, though they were nearly even on the 
Nasdaq market. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts noted that investors once again seemed to be taking their cue from 
positive economic reports. Home builders' stocks, for example, shot up after 
the government said new home sales rose a strong 11.4% in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the government said that the index of leading economic indicators rose 
0.7% in December, pointing toward continued economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 With corporate profits rising and the strong economy suggesting more gains 
ahead, Stocks are "still the only game in town," said David Holt, analyst at 
Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Builders' stocks surging included Pulte, up 2 3/4 to 38 5/8; Kaufman & 
Broad, up 7/8 to 23 7/8 and Ryland, up 1 1/8 to 25 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many industrial stocks responded to the leading-indicators report. Gainers 
included Emerson Electric, up 2 1/8 to 63 5/8; Inland Steel, up 1 3/8 to 35 
3/4; Tenneco, up 1 3/4 to 57 3/4; Dover, up 1 1/4 to 61 1/8; and Fluor, up 1 
3/4 to 46 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oil stocks jumped, catching up with the recent rebound in oil. Mobil gained 
1 to 81 1/8, Phillips rose 7/8 to 31, Texaco added 1 1/4 to 67 3/4 and Amoco 
was up 7/8 to 54 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks also were strong. Oracle soared 1 3/8 to 33 1/8, Symantec 
gained 1 7/8 to 15 3/8 and Compaq jumped 2 1/8 to 87 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among companies responding to earnings reports, phone firm Sprint surged 1 
5/8 to 37 1/8 on a positive report. But Polaroid tumbled 1 3/8 to 33 5/8 on its 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thousand Oaks-based biotech giant Amgen sank 3 to 44 after reporting 
quarterly operating earnings per share up 14%. The company also said it was 
comfortable with analysts' estimates of $2.85 to $2.95 a share for 1994, versus 
$2.48 a share from operations in 1993. At least two brokerages downgraded the 
stock, citing slower-than-expected drug sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sears tumbled 2 1/2 to 51 1/4. Some analysts cut earnings estimates, citing 
expected losses in Sears' Allstate unit because of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, stocks ended mixed. London's FTSE-100 index rose 38.8 points to a 
record high of 3,520.3. Paris' CAC-40 index also hit a record, up 24.64 points 
to 2,355.93. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tokyo's Nikkei-225 index shed 166.31 points to 20,250.03, and Mexico 
City's Bolsa slipped 2.42 points to 2,784.90. Other Markets 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates were mostly flat, stabilizing after jumping Tuesday on worries 
about the strong economy fanning inflation. The Treasury's 30-year bond yield 
eased to 6.28% from 6.31% on Tuesday. 
</P>

LATEST LOSS DEEPENS GLOOM AT EURO DISNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Deepening the financial gloom at the Magic Kingdom outside Paris, Euro Disney 
said Wednesday that its first-quarter net loss grew to $93.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The deficit over the first three months of its 1994 fiscal year ending Dec. 31 
was up from a loss of $71.7 million in the year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, a committee representing about 60 creditor banks was 
given the green light Wednesday to proceed with restructuring talks with the 
U.S.-based Walt Disney Co., said a communique by the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the banks, who together hold roughly two-thirds of the $3.5 
billion in Euro Disney debt, made the decision after hearing the results of an 
independent audit. No details were made public. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney, which holds 49% of Euro Disney's stock, and the banks are to 
decide how much each side would have to concede to keep the park running. 
</P>
<P>
 Euro Disney, 18 miles east of Paris, blamed the deterioration on a decline in 
operating revenues. They fell to $140 million from October-December, down from 
$160 million in the 1992 period. 
</P>
<P>
 This reflected product repositioning and price cuts implemented during the 
quarter, the firm said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Euro Disney reported a stunning loss of $905 million for its first full fiscal 
year of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The park, which opened in April, 1992, said that while attendance was on 
track, people were spending less money and fewer were staying at Euro Disney's 
six hotels than had been expected.

SPACE EXPERT PUSHES TO HALT MILSTAR LAUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the Pentagon makes its final preparations to launch the first $1-billion 
Milstar communications satellite this week, an Air Force expert told Congress 
on Wednesday that the launch should be scrubbed.  
</P>
<P>
 Col. Sandy Mangold, who said his outspoken views cost him his job last year as 
the Air Force's chief for evaluating the service's space program budget, made 
his remarks before the House Government Operations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Mangold, joined by two other officials who said their efforts to cut military 
spending were undermined by superiors, charged that a "cancer" has developed in 
the military acquisition system as the Pentagon attempts to scale back in the 
aftermath of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 After he advocated that the $20-billion Milstar program be terminated, Mangold 
said senior Air Force officers warned him his career was in jeopardy and that 
their plan was "to cut off the head of the snake, while preserving the body." 
</P>
<P>
 Mangold called Milstar, originally intended as the Pentagon's main 
communications link during a nuclear war, a monument to Cold War technology 
that is of little use in regional military conflicts. It will cost over $100 
million a year just to operate the satellite, scheduled to be launched 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), committee chairman, questioned the high cost of 
the Milstar, noting that "2,000 pounds of sand or other form of ballast" will 
be launched on the first two Milstars because a secret portion of the payload 
was removed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Air Force and Defense Department officials have disputed those claims, 
saying the special communication capability provided by Milstar is resistant to 
enemy jamming. (They have said previously that they plan to use less than 900 
pounds of aluminum ballast.) 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Pentagon officials also rebutted criticism Wednesday that they had 
quashed a report suggesting that $10 billion could be saved by developing 
improvements to an existing missile warning satellite instead of developing a 
new system. 
</P>
<P>
 Col. Edward Dietz testified that he was removed as program manager for the 
existing missile warning system, known as the Defense Support Program, after he 
supervised a report that said the DSP system should be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation by the Air Force inspector general found that the Dietz 
report was quashed, but the decision was justified because the improvement 
still would not have satisfied the service's requirements to track short-range 
missiles, according to Col. William Schepens. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the row is still escalating. It was disclosed at the hearing that 
TRW, prime contractor for the DSP, has removed its program manager, Joanne 
Maguire, as part of a deal in which the Air Force agreed to remove her 
counterpart, Col. Joe Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
 Dietz testified that it was a "general understanding" in the Air Force that 
the deal was struck "to make peace" between the service and TRW. The firm 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jane Harmon (D-Marina del Rey) said she was "very troubled" by the 
matter, especially since the aerospace industry cannot afford to lose the few 
women executives it has in responsible technical positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It says disturbing things about how the system is working," Harmon said in an 
interview. "It says it is not an orderly professional system." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a source close to the conflict said Bailey was being used as a 
"sacrificial lamb" by Air Force officials who want to put the embarrassing 
Dietz affair behind them.

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: QUAKE CHECKLIST: FAMILY, DOG, DATA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE J. MAGID, LAWRENCE J. MAGID is a Silicon Valley-based computer 
writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The recent Southern California earthquake and aftershocks are yet another 
reminder of how vulnerable we are. In a disaster, people and pets are your 
first priority. But if you have time to rescue property, don't forget your 
data. Your computer and software can be replaced. Your data may be priceless. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't take a quake, fire, flood or hurricane to destroy data. It can 
happen because of a computer glitch, a human error or theft. I'd hate to face 
the IRS or even my banker without my financial files. And my publisher would be 
very upset if I lost that manuscript I've been slaving over for more than a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 If you aren't already backing up your files, let this be your wake-up call. 
Back up regularly and be sure to store copies of your important files at some 
location other than where you have your personal computer. Any disaster that 
destroys your PC is just as likely to wipe out any backup disks or tapes stored 
in the same office -- even in the same building. 
</P>
<P>
 Backing up may be easier than you think. It's not absolutely necessary to back 
up all your software, although it's a good idea to keep copies of your 
installation diskettes in a safe place. The worst case is that you have to 
replace your software -- possibly at your insurance company's expense. But you 
can't replace your data. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You don't even need special software to back up. Every time you create or 
modify an important file, you can just copy it to a floppy disk and store that 
disk away from your premises. MS-DOS 6.0 and 6.2 come with programs that make 
it easier to back up files. Mac users can purchase a commercial backup program 
such as Norton Utilities, Retrospect or Magnet. MS-DOS backup and commercial 
backup programs compress your files as they're copied, saving you time and 
floppy disks. 
</P>
<P>
 Floppies are fine if you need to store only a few files, but you're much 
better off with a tape backup system such as Jumbo 250 from Colorado Memory 
Systems. The drive itself has a suggested retail price of $199. Backup tapes, 
which store 250 megabytes, cost about $20. 
</P>
<P>
 The tape drive fits into a floppy disk drive bay and doesn't need an adapter 
card. It connects to the floppy drive controller. If that's too much trouble, 
Colorado Memory also makes the Trakker tape system, which plugs into the 
parallel port of any PC. It is simple to install and it's portable, so you can 
move it around to back up other machines. It's an ideal investment for small 
businesses and departments to regularly back up all their machines. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have more than 250 megabytes of data, you can back up two or more 
tapes. Or you can back up data files only. That's what I do, because I already 
have backup copies of my software. 
</P>
<P>
 To simplify the process, I store all my important data files in a single 
directory, on my hard disk. That directory, which I named "data," is further 
divided into sub-directories. My financial data is located in C: data finance, 
my newspaper articles in C: data articles, and each of my book projects has its 
own sub-directory. This way, I can back up all my data in one step by backing 
that single directory and its sub-directories. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Macintosh owners can use a similar strategy, only the data compartments are 
called folders instead of directories. Inexpensive tape backup systems for the 
Macintosh are hard to find. The most popular backup strategy uses a Syquest 
removable hard disk cartridge that stores about 105 megabytes of data. Drives 
from Peripheral Land ((800) 288-8754) and other companies start at about $400. 
Cartridges cost about $75 each. 
</P>
<P>
 I keep a copy of the tape at a friend's house. Commuters can keep their home 
PC's tapes at work and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 I take extra precautions with my financial records. I use electronic mail to 
regularly send copies of my Quicken data files to an out-of-town friend. Once a 
week or so, I use the PKZIP compression program (available as shareware from 
all on-line services and bulletin boards) to compress a year's worth of 
financial files into a 190-kilobyte file. Then I use CompuServe, America Online 
or Prodigy to transmit the file to my friend's PC. He stores it at his house 
and, if something should happen to my data, he'll mail it back to me. 
</P>
<P>
 PKZIP allows you to add a password to a file to assure privacy. The process 
takes just seconds, is very easy and costs less than a dollar for the e-mail 
charges. I've never had to retrieve the file, but I do feel a lot more 
comfortable knowing that my records are safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Mac users can employ a similar strategy using Stuffit, a shareware compression 
program for the Macintosh.

OWNER OF 2 HOSPITALS FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE WIELAWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an escalating battle for control over two debt-burdened San Fernando Valley 
hospitals, their owner, Triad Healthcare Inc., has filed for federal bankruptcy 
protection to evade state efforts to place the hospitals in receivership. 
</P>
<P>
 Triad's action effectively voids a state court order that last week barred 
Triad from firing the management company that has been running the hospitals 
since November. The company, Alpha Partners, was hired by Triad at the urging 
of the state's Cal-Mortgage loan guarantee program -- Triad's largest creditor. 
Since then, relations between Triad's board and state officials have 
deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
 A Triad spokeswoman said Wednesday that the board was still determined to fire 
Alpha and would seek the U.S. Bankruptcy Court's approval at a hearing 
scheduled for today in Los Angeles. State officials said they would attend the 
hearing to oppose Alpha's removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Drumwright, president of Alpha and chief executive of Triad, could not 
be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal wrangling has injected new uncertainty into prospects for the two 
hospitals: Sherman Oaks Hospital and Health Center in Sherman Oaks, and West 
Valley Hospital and Health Center in Canoga Park. They are laboring under a 
$167-million debt load, which Triad took on to acquire the hospitals in 1991. 
The state's Cal-Mortgage program guaranteed the loan, but Triad defaulted last 
summer, leaving taxpayers potentially on the hook for the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the state last week sought to force Triad into receivership, 
saying the Triad board had failed to act on key issues and was threatening to 
disrupt hospital operations by firing Alpha. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge postponed action on the receivership request but issued 
a temporary restraining order barring the Triad board from firing Alpha. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's bankruptcy filing transfers the matter out of state court 
jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending the court action, Triad Chairman Sanford Weiss said it was forced by 
the state's "ill-conceived and precipitous attempt to foreclose on the 
hospitals." He said the company hoped to stabilize operations at the hospitals 
by putting them under the supervision of a neutral bankruptcy referee. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said they would argue in court against any change of 
management at the hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alpha is doing a good job, has the confidence of the staff and is working 
toward the betterment of the hospitals as near as we can determine," said 
Dennis Fenwick, director of Cal-Mortgage.

CAP CITIES/ABC FORMS JOINT VENTURE WITH BRILLSTEIN-GREY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Capital Cities/ABC Inc. has formed a joint venture with Brillstein-Grey 
Entertainment to produce programming for network TV and other media. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership -- a first between a network and an independent production 
company -- links Capital Cities/ABC with one of Hollywood's best-known 
management agencies.Bernie Brillstein and Brad Grey's clients include Dana 
Carvey and Mike Myers. The company also produces "The Larry Sanders Show" for 
HBO. 
</P>
<P>
 Capital Cities/ABC expects Brillstein-Grey to deliver shows to the ABC 
Television Network and other divisions, but the deal is not exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 One knowledgeable source said Capital Cities/ABC also is looking to exploit 
Brillstein-Grey's connections in the stand-up comedy world. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter where the world goes technologically, in the end, the program and 
the talent is the essence," said Robert A. Iger, senior vice president of 
Capital Cities/ABC Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The major broadcast networks plan to step up their investments in programming 
in the wake of relaxed production regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Capital Cities/ABC will contribute the majority of the funding for the 
venture, which could exceed $100 million. Brillstein-Grey will continue to 
operate its management agency/movie company. The deal does not supersede 
Brillstein-Grey's deal at Sony Pictures, although it may reduce some of the 
studio's funding burden. 
</P>
<P>
 Creative Artists Agency helped negotiate the deal, with attorneys Jake Bloom 
and Alan Hergot.

SOUTH O.C. AUTO MALL PLANNERS DEAL WITH REALITIES; MARKETING: RANCHO SANTA 
MARGARITA SITE'S SUCCESS DEPENDS ON IMPROVING ECONOMY, THOUGH IT IS THOUGHT TO 
HAVE A GREAT LOCATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Building a 36-acre auto mall in the midst of a four-year slump in car sales 
might seem like financial suicide, but the developer of this planned community 
is undaunted and Orange County auto dealers say such a South County mall could 
be a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto malls -- the car industry's version of regional shopping centers -- 
generally are conceded to be the future of new car marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the key to this mall's success is timing. And only time, the experts say, 
will tell whether the mall's developer -- Santa Margarita Co., also the master 
developer of the entire 5,000-acre planned community of Rancho Santa Margarita 
-- is being prescient or imprudently premature. 
</P>
<P>
 The smart money seems to favor foresightedness, but if the region's economy 
does not start improving, all bets are off, said Kevin Allen, executive 
director of the Orange County Automobile Dealers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are problems to be dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
 One is that a group of homeowners has risen in opposition, claiming that the 
auto center was not revealed until after they bought properties overlooking the 
site. They say they fear the traffic and brightly lit lots will be unsightly 
and reduce property values. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, California law gives existing dealers the right to challenge a 
competing dealership opening within a 10-mile radius. The Santa Margarita Auto 
Center will be about eight miles from the Irvine Auto Center with its 16 
franchises, including most of the major domestic and Japanese brands, and the 
Mission Viejo strip, which has three luxury car dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Car malls are the future of the business," said Bob Fitzharris, who conducts 
consultant J.D. Power and Associates' annual auto mall study. "But unless the 
economy turns around pretty quickly, there could be a lot of challenges" filed 
against manufacturers who want to set dealerships in Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a challenge is filed against the manufacturer, not the potential new 
dealer. That puts the complaining dealership in the position of fighting the 
factory that supplies its cars, and tends to give the manufacturers a strong 
hand in the ensuing negotiations -- one reason, perhaps, that there are 
numerous dealers who compete daily with other franchises selling the same makes 
just a few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only Ford has announced plans for a presence in Rancho Santa 
Margarita, leasing a four-acre site for Downey Ford owner Jim Graham's second 
dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 And in what could be a good sign for the new mall, Graham and Ford won't be 
challenged by Bob Tuttle, co-managing partner of the Tuttle-Click Automotive 
Group and owner of the Ford and nine other dealerships in the Irvine Auto 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Although located within the 10-mile protest area, Tuttle said that Ford 
representatives helped persuade him to accept a new competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 If the mall were to open this year, "then I would oppose it," Tuttle said. 
"But since the soonest it can open is mid-1995, then I am not opposed as a Ford 
dealer. We find it acceptable given the timing, the hope that the economy will 
start improving by then and the fact that most of the growth in Orange County 
is in the South County." 
</P>
<P>
 A marketing study prepared for the developer says that the population within a 
12-mile radius of the mall site is expected to increase by 15%, or 80,000 
people, to a total of 611,400 by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 At an average of four people and two cars to a household, that added 
population would need about 8,000 new and used cars a year, several dealers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Sumpf, an associate with Auto Center Group, the Newport Beach consulting 
firm that did the marketing studies, said the anticipated population growth and 
the distance that residents of Rancho Santa Margarita now must travel to find 
new car dealers or repair facilities were major considerations in the decision 
to go ahead with the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The deciding factor, of course, was the belief -- one shared by most regional 
economists -- that Orange County's economy should start improving in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 After discussions with several auto manufacturers and Orange County car 
dealers, Sumpf said there should be few challenges from other area dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has about 120 new car dealers, although the number changes 
frequently with consolidations, bankruptcies, partnership breakups and new 
franchise deals. But there are only five auto malls in Orange County and two of 
those -- Garden Grove and Anaheim -- are relatively small, with fewer than six 
dealers each. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the rest of the county's car dealers are clustered in a number of 
strips. The biggest, with about a dozen dealers and two dozen brands of cars 
each, are on Beach Boulevard in Huntington Beach and Harbor Boulevard in Costa 
Mesa, but most every city in the county has several new car lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita Co. said it wants a car mall because it would provide a 
healthy draw for the 460-acre commercial center destined to be the heart of the 
planned community and because, if the community ever incorporates, it would 
provide a tremendous tax base. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike baseball diamonds in Iowa cornfields, though, auto malls don't come 
with an if-you-build-it-they-will-come guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rancho Santa Margarita's mall is thought to have a great location. With 
construction planned to start this summer, the mall's fall, 1995, opening is 
expected to coincide with the extension of the Foothill tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Location, location, location," that's the key to auto mall success, said John 
Rettie, editor of J.D. Power and Assn.'s California Report automotive 
newsletter. Equally important is getting enough dealers to create a critical 
mass -- six is the minium for sustained success, Power analyst Fitzharris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Given an improving economy, getting that many dealers should not be a problem 
in Rancho Santa Margarita, because manufacturers are no longer reluctant to set 
up shop surrounded by potential competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really the customer who dictates malls," said Reed Chesworth, vice 
president of MacPherson Enterprises, which operates half a dozen franchises in 
the Tustin and Irvine auto centers. "That's why dealers are in them. It makes 
it easy for customers to do comparison shopping, provides convenience and a 
nice environment." 
</P>
<P>
 MacPherson owner Joe MacPherson was the driving force behind the Tustin mall 
and moved his four Santa Ana dealerships there when it first opened in 1989, 
just as the economy and car sales began souring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did it with the economy in mind," Chesworth said. "We just didn't think 
the slump would last this long." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with a recession, he said, his dealerships all have consistently better 
sales and higher customer counts than when they were in central Santa Ana and 
the economy was booming. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every dealer is a mall fan, however. Gary Gray, owner of Orange Coast Jeep 
Eagle on Costa Mesa's self-titled Harbor Boulevard of Cars, said he finds the 
heavily traveled street to be a much better location than any mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I catch the guy driving down the road who might not even be thinking of 
buying a car until he sees something juicy I've got on display out front and 
pulls in," Gray said. "He never even goes to the malls.' 
</P>
<P>
 Another Jeep-Eagle dealer, Rick Evans of Huntington Jeep-Eagle, said he was 
attracted by a package of information he received last week from the Santa 
Margarita mall developers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put it in my 'things to read file,' which is a lot better than most of my 
mail gets." Although he has no plans to leave Huntington Beach, Evans said that 
Rancho Santa Margarita would be a logical place for him to set up a second 
Jeep-Eagle dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 He would be joining a statewide trend -- analyst Rettie estimates that 23% of 
all new cars in California are sold in auto malls, compared to just 7% 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The first auto mall in the nation, in fact, was the Riverside Auto Center, 
built in 1965. And the three largest malls -- by number of franchises, acreage 
and gross sales volume -- are in California as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Rettie said that he expects 25% of all U.S. new-car sales to be logged by 
franchises in auto malls within 10 years, partly because the number of malls 
will increase and continued dealership consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
 J.D. Powers has predicted that by 2005 there will be only 5,000 new car 
dealers in the United States, down from about 16,000 now. But those dealers 
would control 20,000 individual franchises. O.C. Auto Malls 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County auto malls range from the three-dealer facility in Garden Grove 
to the giant 20-dealer cluster in Tustin. The proposed location in Rancho Santa 
Margarita would be the southernmost in the county. 
</P>

FROM NOW ON, IT'S JUST ROCKWELL TO US; IMAGE: CHANGE FROM DEFENSE TO COMMERCIAL 
EMPHASIS HIGHLIGHTED BY DROPPING THE INTERNATIONAL.

 Rockwell International Inc., long associated with the Cold War and the space 
race, said Wednesday that it has embarked on establishing a new identity to 
make the technology conglomerate a household word. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, directors of the Seal Beach-based aviation, electronics and 
high-technology company voted during its annual meeting to delete the word 
International from the firm's signage, business cards, stationery, packaging, 
sales material and company vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal corporate name, however, will not be changed. 
</P>
<P>
 The deletion is a recognition that the company, which once relied on defense 
work for half of its annual revenue, is rapidly changing, said company 
spokesman William Banning. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, about 65% of the company's $11 billion in annual sales comes from 
commercial sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's diversification efforts, accelerated by debilitating defense 
cutbacks in Washington, have resulted in increased emphasis on the production 
of such non-defense-related products as automotive parts, microchips, 
telecommunications and commercial aviation gear, Banning said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe this new program is a key way to illustrate to our stockholders, 
Rockwell's most important strength: a unified but globally diverse 
corporation," said Chairman Donald R. Beall in a prepared statement issued 
after the company's annual meeting, which was held in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new identity will provide strong name recognition for Rockwell and its 
valuable brands on a worldwide basis," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also announced Wednesday that William H. Gray III, president of 
the United Negro College Fund, was selected as Rockwell's newest director, 
increasing the size of the board to 13 members. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray, 52, who also serves as a senior minister of the Bright Hope Baptist 
Church in Philadelphia, was a U.S. congressman from Pennsylvania from 1979 to 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 While on Capitol Hill, Gray served as House majority whip, chair of the 
Democratic Caucus and the House Budget Committee, and was a member of the House 
Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also a former faculty member of St. Peter's College in Jersey City, 
N.J., and Temple University in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell's stock closed at $41 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, down 
37.5 cents a share from Tuesday.

HOAG HOSPITAL MAKES LIST OF NATION'S BEST; HEALTH: IT'S CALLED 'A MODEL' BY 
INDUSTRY DATA PROCESSOR AND IS THE ONLY O.C. FACILITY IN TOP 100. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Hoag Hospital was chosen as one of the nation's top 100 medical centers, a 
Baltimore health care information processing firm said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A yearlong study by HCIA Inc., which analyzed financial and health data for 
the hospital industry, set out to demonstrate how hospitals concerned about 
federal health care reform can cut their own costs before the government does. 
</P>
<P>
 The study examined 5,600 hospitals in eight criteria, including hospital 
efficiency in areas including clinical practices, operations and financial 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 Using Medicare and other publicly available data -- the organization did not 
inform the hospitals of its study -- HCIA developed a scoring system that 
looked at how profitable the facilities were, their amount of debt, how long 
their patients were hospitalized on average, how fast the patients recovered, 
the number of subsequent infections and how much patients were charged. 
</P>
<P>
 While the report did not say where Hoag placed among the top 100 hospitals -- 
they were listed alphabetically by state -- HCIA identified Hoag as the only 
hospital among the 34 in Orange County to meet its criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to develop a database and identify the top hospitals so others 
could evaluate them and improve their own performance," said HCIA Vice 
President Jean Chenoweth. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach-based Hoag, which has 416 beds and contains specialized cancer, 
heart and fertility centers, was praised by Chenoweth as "a model" for 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoag spokeswoman Maureen Mazzatenta said that hospital administrators were 
thrilled to be named the best in the county by an independent organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The award, she added, bolsters the belief among employees of the 42-year-old, 
nonprofit hospital that they are operating a well-run medical center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to operate along those lines anyway," Mazzatenta said. "The fact that 
we were named reinforces the philosophy we have. Efficiency is not just 
something we talk about, and it's nice to see an outside group recognize that." 
</P>
<P>
 Other California hospitals listed among the top 100 were: Parkview Community 
Hospital in Riverside, Little Company of Mary Hospital in Torrance, Lakewood 
Regional Medical Center in Lakewood, Methodist Hospital of Southern California 
in Arcadia, El Camino Hospital in Mountain View, Torrance Memorial Medical 
Center in Torrance, and Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina.

COSTA MESA FIRM OFFERS QUAKE AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Strategic Mortgage Services, which is providing inspection work to earthquake 
victims at cost, said Wednesday that it also will assist home mortgage lenders 
hurt by the Jan. 17 Northridge quake by offering them free use of its 
operations center for the next two months. 
</P>
<P>
 SMS, which offers a variety of mortgage services nationwide, said the offer is 
open to residential mortgage lenders who suffered earthquake damage or losses 
to their own document processing operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The SMS facility, which is in Orange, will have computers and processing 
services available from 6:30 a.m. to midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Jan. 25 when it first offered its inspection services at its cost -- 
from $25 to $50 -- SMS has conducted more than 500 inspections of homes damaged 
by the earthquake, said Chris Nard, the company's vice president for marketing.

PICK A CARD, ANY CARD -- FOR NATIONAL HEALTH CARE; IDENTIFICATION: THE 
POTENTIAL MARKET FOR CARDS ENSURING MEDICAL TREATMENT UNDER CLINTON'S REFORM 
PLAN HAS MAKERS OF OPTICAL, MAGNETIC-STRIPE AND SMART CARDS VYING FOR THE 
CONTRACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY BAIR, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton holds all the cards in the Administration's campaign to give 
each American a uniform health insurance identifier. 
</P>
<P>
 His health reform agenda, which is bound to spawn a medical bureaucracy 
lasting into the next century, includes an obscure but important detail: the 
need for factories that can churn out plastic "health security" cards 
guaranteeing access to care. 
</P>
<P>
 The card, which will resemble a credit card, is likely to become a staple of 
every wallet, as common as a Social Security card and driver's license. But who 
will make the card and what type of information it will convey aren't clear 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
 The information question is particularly important because of the sensitive 
nature of personal medical histories and the potential for abuse by thieves, 
counterfeiters and other con artists. 
</P>
<P>
 The health card will provide access to databases that not only contain a 
person's height and weight, but records of medications, substance abuse, mental 
health and family histories. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the uncertainty about the cards hasn't deterred an intense competition 
for this potentially lucrative government work. The battle lines have been 
drawn between producers of the magnetic-stripe card, which is the format for 
credit cards and automated banking cards, and two newer technologies -- the 
smart card and the optical card. 
</P>
<P>
 The stripe card is the least expensive, costing 50 cents to $1.50 each and 
holding the equivalent of a few lines of type. Data is stored on magnetic tape 
on one side. 
</P>
<P>
 The smart card contains a silicon chip that is read by a computer and will 
hold three to four pages of typewritten data. Popular in Europe, the card's 
U.S. use for the most part has been limited to military bases and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Smart cards cost about $1.50 each but can cost much more. A Wyoming food aid 
program, for example, paid $10.34 apiece for smart cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The harder-to-find optical cards cost about $4 each and are similar to smart 
cards but are read by expensive lasers. Optical cards hold the most information 
of any card. Just one, for example, can hold three copies of John Grisham's 
"The Pelican Brief." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton health security blueprint says the card will be a magnetic-stripe 
card that contains a personal identification number and the name of an 
individual's health plan. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean the smart card has been eliminated from consideration. 
Smart-card manufacturers have hired a congressional lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the Administration has shown interest in smart cards. A member of 
Clinton's health task force inquired about a plan to issue smart cards for 
health insurance in North Dakota, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and Nevada, said Tom 
Singer, research director for the Western Governors Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore, the Administration's lead proponent of the 
computerized information age, has said the smart card is the best way to 
deliver government benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Card Manufacturers Assn., which represents stripe- and 
smart-card makers, is neutral on which card should be used, association 
President Robert Blum said. 
</P>
<P>
 But under his other hat, as president of stripe-card maker Colorado Plasticard 
Inc., he said that magnetic-stripe cards will be adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The job would have to be broken up among a number of manufacturers, and it 
would take them awhile," he said in a telephone interview from Littleton, Colo. 
"I certainly couldn't do it alone." 
</P>
<P>
 If a magnetic-stripe card is used, a doctor's office or hospital would obtain 
an account number from the card to tap into a computer medical file over a 
telephone line. The Clinton book said access to records will be limited to 
health professionals "who have a legitimate need to see them." 
</P>
<P>
 Makers of the newer cards say the security of such a network is vulnerable to 
abuse and telephone-line disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "That system will be breached. No doubt about that," said Stephen 
Price-Francis, North American marketing manager for Canon Inc.'s optical cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "What if a company doesn't want to hire someone with AIDS? All they have to do 
is look at what medications that person has taken, and they will know right 
away," said Janet Sayles-Falls, executive director of the Smart Card Industry 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 A security consultant to stripe-card makers said the claim that smart cards 
are safer than stripe cards is nonsense. He said the smart card can be copied 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
 "The simple, low-cost smart card is based on simple algorithms that can be 
broken by any hacker," said Denise Jeffreys, president of XTEC Inc. of Miami. 
Jeffreys also acknowledged that many stripe cards can be compromised "with 
equipment you can buy at any Radio Shack." 
</P>
<P>
 Patients with smart or optical cards would carry their medical life stories. 
But losing the card could mean rebuilding your story. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oklahoma City, smart cards are already sold as portable file cabinets for 
medical information. Eight pharmacies last year began selling the $10-a-year 
Medicard smart card. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven hospitals and an ambulance fleet installed Medicard readers so they can 
quickly obtain information such as histories of heart trouble or epilepsy, 
doctors' phone numbers and names of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the coming thing. I'm telling all my friends about it," said Ed Taylor, 
a retired Oklahoma City oil worker whose card lists his medications and 
allergies. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma City pharmacist Jim Brakebill said his store performs about one 
transaction a day with the red Medicards. If customers visit another druggist 
while out of town, Jim's Tower Pharmacy will perform a 30-second Medicard 
update at no charge when they return. 
</P>
<P>
 Brakebill said two dozen doctors he knows are installing smart-card readers to 
obtain patient information more quickly.

 "Who among us hasn't had to go to the doctor and sit down and fill out the 
same forms every time? What a pain," said Sayles-Falls of the smart card group. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk of a national identification card also raises questions about government 
intrusions. One health care consultant said the key question is not which card 
will be used, but rather whether any card should be issued at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you get any kind of card authorized by the government, people freak 
out, correctly or not," said Grace-Marie Arnett, president of Arnett & Co. in 
Washington. "And the civil libertarians go nuts. Americans rebel against any 
type of state control."

NO-CONTEST PLEA ENDS EX-VALET'S THEFT TRIAL; COURTS: FORMER AIDE TO RESTAURANT 
TYCOON IS PLACED ON PROBATION ON A MISDEMEANOR COUNT OF TAX EVASION. FOUR 
FELONY CHARGES ARE DISMISSED.

 A former personal valet accused of stealing more than $430,000 from the 
founder of the El Torito restaurant chain pleaded no contest to a single 
misdemeanor Wednesday after an Orange County Superior Court judge took the 
unusual step of dismissing the most serious charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarence R. Wheeler was sentenced to one year of probation as part of an 
agreement with prosecutors reached after Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald dismissed 
four felony counts of theft and credit card fraud against him as closing 
arguments in the case were about to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said there was no evidence of theft because restaurant founder Larry 
J. Cano of Newport Beach had given Wheeler unlimited authority to use money 
from Cano's bank account by assigning him power of attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "A general power of attorney allows you to do any darn thing that you want to 
do" with the money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, Wheeler said he was "tired and happy that it's all 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 "I should not have been here in the first place," said Wheeler, 39. "It's been 
a numbing experience, but now I want to try get on with my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler's attorney, Scott Well, said "the judge made the decision 
(prosecutors) should have made a year ago. My client has been falsely 
prosecuted. The real tragedy of this case is that after 16 years of loyal 
service, Mr. Wheeler has nothing to show for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Joe D'Agostino said he "respectfully disagreed" with the 
judge's decision not to send the case to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a question for the jury to make up their minds about the defendant's 
guilt or innocence," D'Agostino said. "I trust in our jury system and thought 
the jury should make that determination, not the judge. I'm disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 Cano said through a spokesman Wednesday night that he was "greatly 
disappointed that the case never got to the jury," but declined further 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler pleaded no contest to one misdemeanor count of tax evasion. In 
addition to the probation, he was fined $25 and ordered to serve 20 days in 
jail. But Fitzgerald suspended the fine and gave Wheeler credit for 20 days 
served shortly after he was arrested in December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 During an eight-day trial,D'Agostino presented evidence that the valet, who 
earned $33,000 a year, lived a lavish lifestyle. Wheeler wore expensive Armani 
suits, dined at the finest restaurants and drove a $42,000 BMW for which he 
paid cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor alleged that Wheeler, who was entrusted to keep track of Cano's 
finances, dipped into Cano's bank accounts and abused his credit cards to buy 
clothing, antiques and expensive jewelry for the restaurateur's chauffeur, 
29-year-old Thomas John Gioa, with whom the valet was romantically involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler, who testified in his own defense, denied the charges, saying that he 
enjoyed a close relationship with Cano, whom he said had given him a free hand 
to spend money from his accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Frederickson, an official of Pacific National Bank in Newport Beach, had 
testified earlier that Cano had signed documents giving Wheeler power of 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The 69-year-old Cano, a former bartender and East Los Angeles native who 
started the El Torito restaurant chain, testified during the trial that he 
never knowingly gave permission to Wheeler to use his money and that he could 
not remember signing the power of attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge said he believed Frederickson's testimony that Cano did 
authorize Wheeler to make transfers and write checks from his personal 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, members of the jury said they were surprised by the 
judge's decision. All 12 indicated they would have found the valet guilty of 
the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was anticlimactic," said Jennifer McKay, a 25-year-old interior designer 
from Newport Beach. "We should have been able to make the decision. . . . After 
eight days, this was a lot of people's time wasted." 
</P>
<P>
 But Well said the district's attorney's office should not have taken the case 
to trial. He noted that prosecutors dropped the charges for lack of sufficient 
evidence last March, but reinstated them six months later.

ASIANS START CELEBRATING NEW YEAR'S IN OLD WAYS; CULTURE: RITUALS, AND EVEN THE 
DATES OF THE HOLIDAY, VARY BY NATION OF ORIGIN. THE JAPANESE HAD THEIRS ALREADY 
-- ON WESTERN NEW YEAR'S. 
</P>

<P>
 A week from today, Korean American children will take a moment to bow to 
senior citizens at the Garden Grove Community Meeting Center, displaying 
respect for their elders in a New Year's ritual that will accompany traditional 
Korean dances and tea ceremonies. An estimated 400 people at the festival will 
feast on bulgogi (barbecued beef) and kimchi (pickled cabbage) .  
</P>
<P>
 This weekend, thousands of visitors to the Vietnamese Community Center in 
Santa Ana and Golden West College in Westminster will eat spring rolls with 
fish sauce and watch "dragons" dance in honor of Tet, the Vietnamese new year. 
</P>
<P>
 And at Irvine Valley College, Mandarin-language hip-hop music blared as 
students ate egg rolls and women donned Ming Dynasty gowns of red and gold in a 
Chinese new year celebration held Wednesday, eight days early. 
</P>
<P>
 From the well-known Tet festivals to the less-famous Cambodian rituals, many 
Orange County Asian groups will celebrate the lunar new year in upcoming days. 
But the traditions they observe will be as diverse as the nations they 
represent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the most important (holiday) for many Asian cultures, regardless of when 
(and how) they celebrate it," said Audrey Yamagata-Noji, a trustee of the Santa 
Ana Unified School District. "There are certain customs, superstitions, 
meanings. For many Asian groups it's the most critical celebration of the 
year." Some Asian Americans will not celebrate at all this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese Americans won't be drinking the traditional New Year's Eve toso sake 
(rice wine) or eat toshikoshi (crossing the year) buckwheat noodles on Feb. 9. 
While the Japanese observed the lunar new year in years gone by, they have long 
since adopted the Western calendar -- in Japan as well as the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never heard of any Japanese American group (in Orange County) celebrating 
(the lunar new year)," said Junko Fuji, who teaches Japanese language and 
culture at several Orange County community colleges. "In Japan, in remote 
countryside areas, they might occasionally." 
</P>
<P>
 For Cambodian and Thai groups, planning for the New Year's celebration hasn't 
even begun. Those groups celebrate the new year for three days beginning April 
13. 
</P>
<P>
 The "lunar year in Cambodian and Thai cultures is different," said Vora 
Kanthoul, head of the United Cambodian Community. April in Cambodia and 
Thailand is the hottest month, a time of relaxation and vacation after the 
harvest and before May rains, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In those three days, people visit Buddhist temples and pray, share food and 
play traditional games such as Cambodian choong, (a tossing game) or 
tug-of-war. Children are expected to pay respect to their elders by sprinkling 
perfume on them, said Kanthoul. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the best-known festival is the Feb. 13-15 Vietnamese Tet 
celebration, which includes fireworks, gifts to children of red envelopes 
containing money, and colorful, traditional costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese Americans here may celebrate the lunar new year together at private 
banquets, said Frank So, one of the directors of the Orange County Chinese 
American Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's quite a few Chinese Americans in Orange County, but they're scattered 
about," So said. "They celebrate in their own groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Debra Shen, an Irvine Valley College student who attended Wednesday's 
celebration, which was staged by the campus Chinese Cultural Assn., agreed.  
</P>
<P>
 "If not for this, I would probably not do anything for the new year, just call 
my parents (in Taiwan)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, Shen said, she would attend the Little Saigon Tet festivals. "It's a 
little different -- the language, the food," she said. "But I like it." Lunar

 Chinese legend has it that when Buddha invited all the animals to visit him, 
only 12 came, led by the rat. The animals were rewarded by having years named 
after them in the order of their arrival. The legend also holds that a person 
will exhibit characteristics of the animal attached to the year of his or her 
birth. The year beginning Feb. 10 is the Year of the Dog. Add in multiples of 
12 from the year of your birth to determine which animal applies to you. Here 
are some of the reputed characteristics of the animals: 
</P>
<P>
 1994 Dog: Loyal, altruistic, attentive, guarded, stubborn, a critic. 
</P>
<P>
 1995 Boar/Pig: Honest, sociable, cultured, a pacifist, gullible, willful and 
wimpy. 
</P>
<P>
 1996 Rat: Charming, sentimental, industrious, gossipy, neurotic and 
quick-tempered. 
</P>
<P>
 1997 Ox/Buffalo: Patient, selfless, industrious, proud, bossy, vindictive and 
jealous. 
</P>
<P>
 1998 Tiger: Passionate, liberal, gutsy, fortunate, sensitive, undisciplined, 
conceited, rash and rude. 
</P>
<P>
 1999 Rabbit/Cat: Steady, ambitious, friendly, discreet, aloof, sneaky and 
antisocial. 
</P>
<P>

SHORTAGE OF FUNDS LEAVES SOME BUILDINGS AT UCI, CAL STATE QUAKE HAZARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BRAZIL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly two dozen buildings on the Cal State Fullerton and UC Irvine campuses 
have been tagged by seismic experts as posing potentially life-threatening 
hazards during major earthquakes, but university officials say it will be years 
before they have the money to do quake-proofing. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus officials have known about the seismic hazards in walls and foundations 
since 1979. But they have delayed making repairs because of a combination of 
funding shortages, a push for new construction to accommodate swelling numbers 
of students and the logistics associated with renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials acknowledge they are pushing their luck, but they say hundreds of 
millions of dollars are needed for the retrofitting, and there is only so much 
money to go around, especially during the state's lingering budget crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 At UCI, two structures are listed as "very poor" in their ability to withstand 
a major quake like the one that hit Southern California last month: the central 
plant and dance rehearsal addition. Twelve other structures have been deemed 
"poor," including the science lecture hall, library annex, fine arts 
administration building, art and sculpture studios and humanities office 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for strengthening four of the 14 structures -- the science lecture hall, 
library and annex, and the central plant -- are underway, but work on all the 
vulnerable buildings are not likely to be completed until close to the 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebekah Gladson, UCI's acting assistant vice chancellor, said several of the 
remaining retrofitting projects are scheduled to begin in fiscal year 1994-95, 
but it's not a sure thing: University officials still don't know if the state 
budget will allow funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Although critics have expressed concerns that officials at the nine UC 
campuses, all of which have buildings with potential earthquake hazards, have 
dragged their feet on the retrofitting, Gladson said UCI has taken the issue 
"very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 She noted that the school has conducted its own seismic studies to ensure 
safety, and has rehabilitated or demolished six structures that were designated 
potential deathtraps by the state Seismic Safety Commission in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cal State Fullerton, several buildings fall into the "poor" or "very poor" 
categories, including the school's only library, bookstore/commons, humanities 
and social sciences, Langsdorf and physical education buildings and the health 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Stevens, Cal State Fullerton's director of physical plant, said the 
university recently completed the design plans to reinforce the library, but 
"it's a matter of finding a funding source." No plans have been made to 
retrofit the remaining structures, and Stevens would not hazard a guess as to 
when the projects would be budgeted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take $3.5 million just for our library," Stevens said. 
"Obviously, we're talking about some big dollars, and you're going to need to 
set some priorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cal State Fullerton officials are concerned about getting the 
reconstruction finished, Stevens noted that the library sustained only 
"cosmetic damage" during the Jan. 17 Northridge quake. Still, students and 
library workers were not allowed in the building for several days until civil 
engineers examined the building and gave it a passing grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," Stevens said, "the right earthquake could bring it all down." 
</P>
<P>
 In the scheme of things, university officials do not view the situation as a 
crisis, Stevens said. If they believed students were in imminent danger, he 
said, "they would have been doing something about it a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said the damage Cal State Northridge sustained during the recent 
temblor has had a sobering effect. Fires broke out in science buildings on the 
Northridge campus, at least one parking garage collapsed and the Sierra Tower, 
a seven-story complex of faculty offices and classrooms, was heavily damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody had told me two weeks ago that that would have happened (at 
Northridge), I would have said, 'No way,' " Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 The buildings at UCI and Cal State Fullerton are among 188 buildings and 
student hangouts in the UC and California State University systems yet to be 
repaired despite being considered poor or very poor seismic risks. While the 
list was first compiled in 1979, it is only in recent years that college 
officials have begun significant efforts to address the potential hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers and earthquake experts have faulted college officials for being slow 
to act, but college officials say that isn't the case; they say they've had a 
difficult enough time finding money in recent years just to maintain the status 
quo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state has had a budget shortfall for years," said Stevens from Cal State 
Fullerton, "and that's been a big part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 By putting off the reconstruction, Stevens said, campus officials acknowledge 
they are taking a gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just went through this earthquake, and the damage was just some cracked 
drywall," Stevens said. "But then tomorrow you might have one on the Inglewood 
fault, and it could take all of the buildings down." 
</P>
<P>
 Other structures that could pose threats during earthquakes are the fine arts 
building at Cal State Long Beach, the John M. Pfau Library at Cal State San 
Bernardino and UCLA's landmark Royce Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State administrators have the assistance of the state architect's office 
to help monitor construction and set priorities among the 101 remaining 
projects on their campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 87 remaining projects in the UC system, 27 are scheduled to be done 
between now and 1996, 46 are slated to be finished by 2001 and 14 are not yet 
scheduled.

TWO BODIES DISCOVERED IN CAR TRUNK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The bodies of two men were found Wednesday in the trunk of a Cadillac 
convertible that had been abandoned at a remote rock quarry, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims, who were shot to death, had not been identified late Wednesday 
night. Police described them as male Latinos, one in his 20s and the other in 
his 30s. Both had several gunshot wounds to the upper torso and head, said Sgt. 
Steve Rodig. 
</P>
<P>
 Discovery of the bodies came after a tow-truck driver was called to the Owl 
Rock Products Co., near Santa Ana Canyon Road and Gypsum Canyon, about 10:40 
a.m. to impound the illegally parked 1988 Cadillac. Police said the driver 
called them after noticing a strong odor coming from the trunk. Officers found 
the bodies when they opened the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the bodies had been in the car for at least several days, but 
other details about the crime were sketchy. The car had apparently been left at 
the quarry Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know a whole lot at this point," Rodig said. 
</P>
<P>
 The car had not been reported stolen and is registered to a Manuel Avilez, 
according to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Attempts to reach the owner of 
the car were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees at the quarry called police Monday to complain about the car, which 
had been left alongside a dirt road and appeared to be abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers who viewed the car Monday apparently did not notice an odor and 
advised the company to have a tow truck remove it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company did not call to have the car removed for a few more days," Rodig 
said. "When they did, police responded back to the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Graack, a spokeswoman for Owl Rock Products, which is headquartered in 
Arcadia, declined to comment on the grim discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Hafer, a truck driver with Robertson's Ready-Mix, which is several 
hundred yards down the hill from Owl Rock, said he saw the car on the side of a 
dirt road Saturday morning. The car had not been there at 4 p.m. Friday, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Hafer and Malcom Erbst, who also drives a cement mixer for Robertson's, 
said that there is usually a guard at the gate near where Gypsum Canyon Road 
turns into a private dirt road leading to Owl Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the past three weeks, the men said, there has been no guard there.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; FHP OPENS OWN CHILD CARE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maria Umaguing has found a day-care center where she knows her 3-year-old son, 
Jordan, will be in good hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Umaguing didn't have to search very far.  
</P>
<P>
 Her company, FHP International Corp., has opened the first corporate-sponsored 
child care center in Orange County for its employees and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a secure feeling. I know the facility is a safe facility," said 
Umaguing, who designs the company's health-care facilities and also had a hand 
in developing the floor plans for the center. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP employees, their children, company representatives and city officials 
attended the center's grand opening festivities Wednesday. To commemorate the 
opening of the center, children dipped their hands in paints of primary colors 
then made their imprints onto a canvas that will be hung in the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Bodaken, FHP senior vice president and associate chief operating 
officer, said the health-care company invested about $500,000 to open the 
center, behind City Hall. FHP is also subsidizing the child care in order to 
offer reasonably priced care. The cost is $120 a week for children 6 weeks old 
to 2 years old, $100 a week for children 2 years old and $98 a week for 
children 3, 4 and 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodaken said the center will be operated by Pasadena-based Burud & Associates, 
which specializes in corporate child care centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Because finding quality child care is a concern among working parents, FHP 
officials said the Fountain Valley-based company recognized the need and wanted 
to offer the alternative to employees. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP employees agreed that the company-operated center eases the stress of 
dealing with child care arrangements and offers them a convenience since it's 
close to their workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Employee Ria Marie Carlson plans to place her 2-year-old daughter, Alexandra, 
at the center, which she said will give her "peace of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that I know my child is getting good, quality care close by is a 
tremendous load off me," said Carlson, whose husband has stayed home to care 
for their daughter to save on child-care costs. "From a personal level, now I 
can focus more on my job when I don't have to worry about my child." 
</P>
<P>
 The child care center is in a city-owned building which the company is 
leasing. City employees can also use the center on a space-available basis. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP renovated the building to accommodate 72 children, ages 6 weeks to 5 years 
old. The center has four rooms for the varying ages of the children, and 
outdoor play areas equipped with slides, sand, toys and climbing contraptions.  
</P>
<P>
 Bodaken said the company has been working to open a center for 2 1/2 years and 
selected Fountain Valley because an estimated 3,000 employees work within five 
miles of the center. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP's corporate headquarters, a hospital and medical offices are in Fountain 
Valley. There are also FHP medical facilities and offices in Costa Mesa and 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The location made a lot of sense because we have so many employees that are 
able to use the facility," Bodaken said.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; VASQUEZ LEADS WAY IN CONTRIBUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With three seats up for grabs on the County Board of Supervisors this year, 
the local fund-raising competition is being won by an incumbent who doesn't 
stand for reelection until 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign contribution reports filed Monday show that Supervisor Gaddi H. 
Vasquez is sitting on a whopping $316,450. 
</P>
<P>
 Long rumored as a possible candidate for a number of statewide offices, 
Vasquez said Monday that "right now" he intends to remain on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any specific intentions other than to do a good job here," 
Vasquez said. "Tomorrow is another day, but right now, at this hour, I wouldn't 
read anything into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez's available bankroll far surpasses totals amassed by the five 
candidates vying to succeed longtime supervisors Thomas F. Riley and Harriett 
M. Wieder, both of whom are retiring this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third seat, Supervisor William G. Steiner -- who was appointed to fill 
the remaining term of former Supervisor Don R. Roth, convicted early last year 
on state ethics violations -- so far is running unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the political interest in the county board races has been focused in 
Huntington Beach, where three candidates are running to fill Wieder's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Due in large part to a personal loan of $200,000, local businesswoman Haydee 
Tillotson leads the district's money wars with an additional $50,000 raised in 
individual contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillotson's campaign financing strategy, however, has become a target for 
criticism from at least one other candidate, Huntington Beach Mayor Linda 
Moulton-Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she's trying to buy this election," said Moulton-Patterson, who has 
raised $33,480 during the past reporting period for a total of $71,000. "I 
don't think you can buy an election. We're doing a good job getting a lot of 
$50 and $75 contributions. That's the way we want to run." 
</P>
<P>
 But Moulton-Patterson's statement does include larger contributors, most 
notably the Irvine Co., with a $1,000 contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach City Councilman Jim Silva is also in the race, having raised 
nearly $40,000 during the past six months, for a total of $56,604. 
</P>
<P>
 In Riley's South County district, state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) 
has raised just less than $70,000 in the past six months for a total of 
$73,415. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Bergeson has one opponent in the 5th District race, Laguna Hills 
businesswoman Madelene Arakelian, who has pledged to raise at least $200,000. 
Arakelian's contribution report was not available Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Steiner so far is running without opposition, that hasn't stopped him 
from raising funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner lists total contributions during the past six months at nearly 
$100,000 for a total of $156,555. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody said I couldn't dial for dollars," the former city of Orange 
councilman and 4th District incumbent said. "I don't want to assume anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Mention of possible challengers have included Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly and 
Councilman Irv Pickler, but neither have declared themselves candidates for the 
board race. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in Monday's filings was the final required contribution statement 
filed by Roth. The former supervisor listed total contributions of $100 during 
the past six months. But all cash on hand, $10,594, was paid to the clerk of 
Orange County Municipal Court related to his conviction last year. KEVIN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STANTON; RECREATION CLERK GETS TOP EMPLOYEE HONOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A part-time clerk in the Recreation Department is the city's Employee of the 
Year. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week honored Janet Beeler, a laid-off aerospace worker, 
after only a year on the recreation staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Beeler helps residents register for classes, organizes the senior lunch 
program, and coordinates volunteers. The Huntington Beach resident had worked 
for five years as a secretary for a defense subcontractor but was laid off 
after her company lost work. She got the Stanton job after seeing an 
advertisement in a newspaper, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other workers were also honored, including Frank (Scooter) Gummeson, a city 
maintenance worker with 30 years of service. 
</P>
<P>
 Building Department secretary Karen Hicks and mechanic Ron Navarro were given 
10-year service awards. Custodian Bill Almeida, management assistant Denise 
Archambault, maintenance worker John Hochmuth and code enforcement officer John 
White were all honored for five years of work for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also gave first prize in the holiday decorating contest to John 
and Betty Jean Travers of the Fernwood Mobile Home Park. City employees judged 
the decorating contest in December, and based the award on originality, 
creativity and holiday spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Vallie Sue Wahl received a commendation for her dedication to the 
city and her neighborhood. Wahl, a resident since 1977, works to remove 
graffiti from her neighborhood, delivers meals to the elderly and belongs to 
school and scouting organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also gave a commendation to Sarah Ahulani Harryman, 14, to help 
her compete this summer in a teen-age scholarship program. 
</P>
<P>
 And council members individually gave donations to Marisa Mendoza, 16, who is 
seeking sponsors to help her compete next month in the Miss Teen-Age California 
Scholarship Pageant. Mendoza told the council she wants to become an 
obstetrician and open a clinic in Stanton after graduating from medical 
school.WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; FIRE UNION PRESIDENT SAYS HE'LL BE FIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Gilbrook, president of the firefighters union, said Wednesday that he 
expects to lose his job as fire engine driver after city officials refused to 
allow him to present witnesses at his termination hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a railroad job," said Gilbrook after a 1 1/2-hour hearing behind 
closed doors Wednesday conducted by Asst. City Manager Don Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbrook, who has been suspended with pay since Dec. 28, said that he will be 
notified Fridayif he can keep his job. He has been with the Fire Department for 
13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan C. Davis, Gilbrook's lawyer, said that they will file a wrongful 
termination suit against the city if his client is fired. 
</P>
<P>
 After a city investigation in January, Gilbrook was accused of embezzlement 
and grand theft of city funds for allegedly using sick leave improperly in June 
and November, 1993. The amount involved was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also being charged with failure to submit the required paperwork on 39 
occasions over the past three years when he took sick leaves and vacations. In 
addition, he is accused of breaking department rules when he drove a firetruck 
three times with a suspended driver's license, and five times without a 
state-required medical certificate. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbrook said that the charges are false. He said high-ranking officers in the 
department would testify that the policy of submitting paperwork for sick leave 
and vacation was not consistently enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that Gilbrook was allowed to present witnesses during last 
month's investigation, and said that additional testimony Wednesday was not 
necessary. BERT ELJERA

<P>
 A parent education program aimed at keeping children safe from abuse and 
abduction will be held at Loyal H. Barker Elementary School today. 
</P>
<P>
 The event will be held in the school's multipurpose room, starting at 7 p.m., 
said Alan Trudell, spokesman for the Garden Grove Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Meredith Kallas, a safety education spokeswoman for the Adam Walsh Center of 
California, will offer tips on child safety and preventing the abduction of 
children. The Adam Walsh Center is a branch of the National Center for Missing 
and Exploited Children. 
</P>
<P>
 Refreshments and free child care will be provided during the event, which is 
sponsored by the school's Parent Teacher Assn. The program is part of an effort 
by the PTA and staff to get parents more involved in school activities, Trudell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is at 12565 Springdale St. The program is open to all parents of 
students at Barker and neighboring elementary schools. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB TO GET CITY LOAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week agreed to loan the Boys and Girls Club of Cypress 
$20,000 to help keep programs available for youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the deal, the club must repay the loan and 5% interest within four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Club officials had asked for a $40,000 loan to be repaid without interest in 2 
1/2 years, but they said they were pleased with the council's offer. They said 
the club was in danger of losing several programs and eliminating jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll still have to tighten our belts," said Kim Maxwell, executive director 
of the Boys and Girls Club. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the club will scale back some programs but will not have to eliminate 
any classes or activities or lay off employees. Instead, programs like the 
woodworking class, which is currently offered five days a week, will now be 
offered three days a week and employees' hours will be cut back. 
</P>
<P>
 The club's $180,000 annual budget is mostly made up of donations from 
foundations and nonprofit organizations. "Because of the economy, donations 
have dwindled," Maxwell said. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; DECISION DELAYED ON 'SPACE-SAVER' SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ignoring shouts from the audience to "take a stand," the Santa Ana Unified 
School District board postponed a decision on whether to build a "space-saver" 
school in the Bristol Marketplace shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 After seven hours of testimony and debate that lasted until almost 2 a.m. 
Wednesday, board members agreed to delay their action until a special meeting 
Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to be fiscally prudent. We're talking about a $43-million project. 
That's big bucks," said board President Sal Mendoza. 
</P>
<P>
 "This proposal has been treated like a business deal, and a hasty one at that, 
instead of a facility for our children and the best one for our children," 
Trustee Rosemarie Avila added. "There are a lot of problems with this site, and 
there need to be real changes, not a lot of unwritten promises." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Supt. Rudy M. Castruita warned the board in an emotional speech that 
delays could jeopardize state funding for the project and cost the district a 
crucial opportunity to alleviate overcrowding at local campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an employee of this district, I am deeply saddened tonight," he told the 
board. "Our kids and youngsters deserve the very best, and my No. 1 concern is 
the building of new facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Space-saver schools are built vertically, with several stories, instead of 
taking up large areas with single-floor buildings. The idea behind them, 
according to school officials, is to add schools -- without condemning private 
property -- in dense cities with little room for new development. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the school would house 1,300 intermediate students and serve as a 
model for other urban districts statewide, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Castruita emphasized that the project is an opportunity to build a school four 
to seven years faster than by using traditional methods. If the board fails to 
adopt the space-saver plan, any alternative school construction would most 
likely require condemning residents' homes to make room for a new campus. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 450 people attended Tuesday night's public hearing at Rancho 
Santiago College's Phillips Hall, with many spilling outside. About 80 people 
spoke to the board, with roughly two-thirds favoring the project, and comments 
often sparked loud applause. Several people called for the board to delay its 
vote so that potential problems such as traffic, noise and security could be 
better addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to move on this item tonight. We need to be aggressive in handling 
this situation," said Trustee Robert W. Balen after hearing public comments. "I 
think our district has been given an opportunity to grab the brass ring, and if 
we turn it down," the children of the district will suffer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Audrey Yamagata-Noji joined Balen in supporting the plan. But Balen 
later withdrew his motion to approve the required environmental document when a 
board majority appeared ready to reject it. 
</P>
<P>
 Avila suggested that the district scrap the current plan and resubmit a 
proposal for an alternative site. Trustee Tom Chaffee objected to placing a 
school inside a shopping mall and surrounding it with parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza emphasized that he supports building at the site but believes the 
district should not purchase the land until it has the money from the state in 
hand, pointing out that about half of the money is contingent on voter approval 
of a bond issue in June. 
</P>
<P>
 When the board began discussing whether to delay a decision, some of the 
dozens of restless, tired and often irritated audience members started shouting 
at trustees: "Take a stand! Vote on it tonight!" JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; COUNCIL BACKS LAW ON GRAFFITI ABATEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members have given their support to a graffiti abatement 
ordinance that requires prompt removal of the painted words and symbols and 
restricts the storage, sale and possession of spray paint and markers used by 
vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 By unanimous vote Tuesday, the council approved provisions of the ordinance 
that give graffiti vandals, known as taggers, and property owners specific time 
limits to remove the markings, prohibit sales of graffiti implements to persons 
under 18, and make it illegal for youths to possess spray paint and other 
marking tools in public areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider final approval of the ordinance Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not drafting the definitive graffiti ordinance," said Sheriff's Lt. Joe 
Davis, chief of police services. "We're drafting what we think is applicable to 
what we're facing today." 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Terry Dixon said much of the ordinance is drawn from existing state 
anti-graffiti and vandalism laws. "Really, what this ordinance is, to a great 
deal, is supplementary to state law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance requires a graffiti vandal, if caught, to remove his moniker 
within 24 hours. In cases where the vandals are unknown, property owners are 
required to remove or cover up the graffiti in three days. A property owner who 
refuses to remove graffiti after receiving notice from city officials may be 
subject to proceedings that may result in the city removing the markings at the 
property owner's expense. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance makes graffiti vandalism a misdemeanor and holds the parents of 
arrested vandals responsible for removal of the markings. 
</P>
<P>
 A reward fund of $2,500 also would be established under the ordinance. Anyone 
providing information that leads to the arrest and conviction of a graffiti 
vandal would be eligible for a reward of up to $500. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses that sell paint, markers and other tools commonly used for graffiti 
must keep them out of immediate reach of the public, according to the 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance identifies graffiti implements as spray-paint cans, etching 
tools, adhesive-backed stickers, and felt tip markers and paint sticks with 
tips over an eighth-inch wide. 
</P>
<P>
 The only concerns voiced came from representatives of San Diego Gas & 
Electric, Southern California Edison and Pacific Bell, whose utility boxes, 
poles and transformers are favorite targets of graffiti vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 The representatives said that while their companies have established 
graffiti-abatement programs and supported the city's effort, there may be times 
when they are unable to meet the city's specified time limits for removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members and City Manager Tim Casey said they expected to work with the 
utilities in good faith. They also said city crews would assist in covering up 
graffiti on the utilities' property, using paint supplied by the utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see this ordinance as a hammer to use against residents and business 
owners who are cooperating with us," Casey said. RICHARD CORE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; SALVATION ARMY SITE HANDLES QUAKE RELIEF 
</P>

<P>
 The Salvation Army has received tens of thousands of tons of clothing, toys, 
food and water from contributors all over the world in the 17 days since the 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 And a good chunk of it has come through the Salvation Army's Adult 
Rehabilitation Center in Anaheim, where it is being processed for shipment to 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially, we were the prime warehouse for receiving the material because we 
had extra space," said Maj. Oliver Stenvick, the administrator of the 
100,000-square-foot facility. He said the warehouse had about 40,000 square 
feet available before the Jan. 17 quake. "But we quickly ran out of that. Five 
other (Salvation Army) warehouses have had to help us out." 
</P>
<P>
 To process the donations, workers at the warehouse first sort the goods 
separating clothes by sex and age group. The clothing and toys are then packed 
and sent to Salvation Army thrift stores in the earthquake area. Those who lost 
their belongings in the quake are given vouchers by the Salvation Army to 
receive clothing. The food and water is distributed at army relief stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Stenvick said that while donations have come in from throughout the world, 
most are from elsewhere in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of Saturdays ago we had 40 semis pull up stuffed with clothes from 
San Diego," Stenvick said. "Even people who can't afford to share much always 
seem to be able to share some of their clothing." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday afternoon, a three-ton shipment of clothing arrived from Hong 
Kong, where it had been collected by the American Women's Assn. The letter 
accompanying the shipment said donations were received from all of that city's 
many ethnic communities, which made a special effort to collect children's 
clothing and blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Americans, we always think about how we send donations to the Far East," 
said James E. Thompson, chief executive officer of Crown Pacific, the Hong 
Kong-based shipping firm that donated the transportation for the clothing. He 
was in Southern California on Tuesday and accompanied the shipment to the 
warehouse. "It's nice to see some of that coming back."TERRY SPENCER

 When it came to his children's education, Stephen McArthur planned ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 He began attending meetings and serving on committees in the Irvine Unified 
School District 12 years ago -- just after the birth of his first child, 
Michael. 
</P>
<P>
 "What prompted me to get involved was that I wanted to understand the kind of 
education my kids would receive," McArthur said. "I wanted to see if I should 
plan on sending them to a private school." 
</P>
<P>
 What he saw at Irvine Unified impressed him. Not only do his two children now 
attend district schools, but he was appointed last week to fill a vacant seat 
on the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 McArthur was one of 11 candidates who applied to serve out the eight months 
remaining on the term of Greg Smith, who left the board last year to take a 
seat on the Irvine City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members cited McArthur's years of experience as a district volunteer as 
a key reason for his appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked the fact that Steve has had a consistent interest in the school 
district for a long time," said board member Margie Wakeham. "He'll make a good 
addition." 
</P>
<P>
 McArthur said he was "amazed" at being selected from a field that included 
several Ph.D.s and many professionals with advanced degrees. "I was overwhelmed 
by the quality of the candidates," he said. "It was an honor to be selected." 
</P>
<P>
 McArthur has served on a slew of district committees and dealt with issues 
ranging from labor relations and finances to curriculum and budget matters. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, he's worked closely not only with other parents but with 
teachers, administrators and district officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "The continuity of knowing what's happened in past really helps," he said. 
"I've known administrators and teachers for a long time. I remember as a parent 
interviewing (Supt. David E. Brown) when he first came to the district." 
</P>
<P>
 McArthur, a commercial real estate broker who lives in the Northwood village 
with his wife and two sons, ranked financial issues as the biggest challenge 
facing the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many school districts, Irvine has been forced to cut some programs and 
demand concessions in labor contracts to make up for reductions in funding from 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge is to keep Irvine's reputation for excellence in the forefront 
in light of the tight budgets we have," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's future financial health, he added, will depend in part on the 
success of a recently launched fund-raiser aimed at collecting millions of 
dollars from Irvine businesses and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 McArthur said he would also like to restore funding for music and arts 
programs that have been cut in recent years. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; CITY, LAWYER SETTLE LONG-RUNNING 
SUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bitter, nearly three-year-old series of lawsuits pitting a local attorney 
against the city of San Juan Capistrano ended quietly this week with both sides 
agreeing to give up the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Carlos F. Negrete and the City Council agreed Tuesday to settle the 
lawsuits over an alleged misuse of public funds by dismissing all pending 
litigation, claims and appeals and agreeing not to sue each other for five 
years. The agreement also stipulates both sides pay their own attorney fees, 
which for the city totaled more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Negrete and a group of other residents who called themselves the Committee to 
Restore Integrity in San Juan Capistrano sued the city and eight city officials 
beginning in March, 1991, claiming a contract with former City Manager Stephen 
B. Julian was a misuse of public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the lawsuits were dismissed in Superior Court, but Negrete and the 
committee appealed and another court ruling was expected by this summer, 
according to city officials.  
</P>
<P>
 The agreement came by a 4-1 vote with Councilman Gil Jones dissenting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have some serious concerns about this agreement," Jones said before the 
vote. "I have always held the position that we have prevailed in the courts and 
we would prevail ultimately at the appellate court level. . . . This is 
something a judge should decide." 
</P>
<P>
 A judge's decision "would restore some confidence in the community about our 
innocence," Jones added. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement frees Negrete from a ruling requiring him to pay the city 
$814,000 in legal fees incurred during the lawsuits. Further legal actions 
since that ruling upped the total spent by the city to "slightly over $1 
million," according to City Atty. Richard K. Denhalter.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Carolyn Nash called it "discouraging" to settle without 
collecting the fees from Negrete. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if we do win on appeal, we are not going to get the money back," Nash 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Collene Campbell agreed, adding that "if I thought there was a prayer to 
recoup the money that was awarded to us, I would not enter this agreement. . . 
. It's a hard pill to swallow, but I am relieved the city will no longer have 
to put money in this pot." 
</P>
<P>
 Negrete said Wednesday he was "very pleased. . . . I stood by my principles 
throughout the whole case." LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; COUNCIL POSTPONES WATER RATE VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU PICKEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angry residents and worried business leaders persuaded the City Council on 
Tuesday night to postpone a proposed 6% water rate increase until the council 
makes a greater effort to hear from its opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "This proposed increase is supposed to start today and there's been no public 
input," said Thomas O'Neill, who is suing the city over a 2% utility tax passed 
despite public opposition last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's going on?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 After listening to a handful of upset residents, the council postponed its 
vote on the increase until March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see no big need to rush it," said Councilman Don Bankhead.  
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Councilwoman Molly McClanahan suggested the city hold 
workshops for the public about the rate increase and meet with the Chamber of 
Commerce to discuss its impact on business. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed increase would raise the average bimonthly residential water bill 
from $42.30 to $44.84, consultant William Ferry of Brown & Caldwell told the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferry recommended two additional water rate increases that would total 19% 
during the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 All three increases are meant to raise $3 million for water main repairs in 
the downtown area and to replenish cash reserves in case of drought, fire and 
other emergencies, Ferry said. Without the increase, he predicted the city's 
current $2.75-million reserve would be depleted by late 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 While Ferry promised the council that Fullerton would still have one of the 
lowest water rates in the county even with the increase, opponents were not so 
easily persuaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow Hume, who is leading a recall drive against several City Council members 
because of the utility tax, said the rate increase would pay for higher city 
operating costs, not the actual cost of water. He told the council to trim the 
city budget rather than increase rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Control costs and don't raise the rates," said Hume, who was applauded after 
he spoke. In particular, Hume pointed to city water meter readers and 
secretaries who make around $30,000 per year. The salaries, he said, are 
outrageously high and should be slashed to save money. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Kerr, president-elect of the Fullerton Chamber of Commerce, said he too 
is concerned about the increase and suggested raising the base rate on all 
water bills as an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerr's proposal would apply to everyone, regardless of water use, and would 
end up benefiting larger water consumers and hurting smaller ones, Ferry said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; AMUSEMENT PARK PLANS TO BE DISCUSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The controversial development of an amusement park off Harvard Avenue will be 
discussed tonight at a Planning Commission meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussion will not directly affect plans to build the park, but it will 
give commissioners and the public a chance to express their opinions about the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the park site is zoned for an entertainment complex, the project is 
considered a "permitted use" that can be built without commission or City 
Council approval as long as it meets general city guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Park opponents who live near the proposed location have demanded that the city 
fully review the project anyway. The residents fear the amusement park will 
attract gangs and crime as well as increase traffic and noise in the area 
between the Westpark and University Park villages. 
</P>
<P>
 A San Francisco-based developer hopes to open the complex of miniature golf 
courses, batting cages, bumper boat rides and an arcade later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition to the park has mounted ever since the project was announced late 
last year. More than 150 foes jammed a council meeting last month to complain 
about the park. At the meeting, both the developer and Irvine police officials 
said the facility would have strict security policies. SHELBY GRAD

FALL FROM POLE IMPALES 2 MEN ON IRON FENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Kern was having a little trouble sitting down Wednesday afternoon. And no 
wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 The 39-year-old cable company employee fell 10 feet from a pole earlier in the 
day and landed on the four-inch point of a wrought iron fence, which impaled 
his right buttock. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the pain, the Silverado Canyon resident managed to keep his sense of 
humor about the incident, which may keep him off the job for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little uncomfortable," Kern said with a chuckle. "The fence was only a 
couple of feet high so I was able to slide myself off. It was messy." 
</P>
<P>
 Kern and co-worker Kayne Slater, 22, were repairing a cable line in the 3000 
block of North Sheri Street about 10 a.m. Wednesday when the incident occurred, 
said Orange Fire Department dispatcher Kevin Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were both on the pole and (Kern) slipped and came down on (Slater), who 
was working slightly below him," Rice said. "They both fell down the pole and 
landed on the wrought iron fence." 
</P>
<P>
 Slater, who was on his first day on the job for Coastal Cable Construction in 
Orange, was also injured when one of the points pierced his left upper arm. 
Co-workers helped to free him, Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men were treated at Kaiser Permanente Hospital-Orange County in Anaheim 
and released. Slater left work for the day and could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Kern said he fell when the gaff that secured his footing became dislodged. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst thing was that I knew what was happening and there wasn't a darn 
thing I could do to stop it," he said. "I just thought, 'Here I go, I'm going 
down.' "

DISTRICT ATTORNEY AIDING GRAND JURY IN BRANCH PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County prosecutors are assisting the grand jury in an unusual 
investigation into whether misconduct findings against County Recorder Lee A. 
Branch warrant his removal from office, sources confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's help was requested by the grand jury after the Board 
of Supervisors last week upheld allegations of sexual harassment and gross 
mismanagement leveled against Branch by his employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the district attorney's office and grand jury foreman Frank 
Kroeger declined to comment on the matter Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But other top county officials said that a copy of a scathing report by the 
county personnel department on Branch's conduct and management practices was 
turned over to the grand jury last week. The grand jury then contacted the 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch, who has denied any wrongdoing, could not be reached late Wednesday to 
comment on the district attorney's involvement. But earlier Wednesday he 
affirmed his decision to seek a fifth term in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch's attorney, Lloyd Charton, said he had not been informed of the 
district attorney's participation in the grand jury investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine what possible reason to have prosecutors become involved," 
Charton said. "It's unfortunate that some people have nothing better to do." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said the involvement of the grand jury and the district 
attorney's office was necessary because Branch, an independently elected 
official, has refused to submit his resignation in the face of the misconduct 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Short of losing a bid for reelection in June, Branch, 57, can only be 
recommended for removal by the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors, lacking authority over Branch's office, last week 
publicly condemned the recorder's behavior and referred the matter to the grand 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have said that the removal proceeding is rarely used and that it 
could be the first time the board has called on the grand jury to consider 
removing a public official from office. The proceeding is not considered a 
criminal matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The county personnel investigation focused heavily on Branch's office romance 
with department supervisor Nancy L. Smith. Investigators said that Branch's 
favored treatment of Smith created such a hostile work environment that at 
least nine employees sought medical or psychological treatment for stress and 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith has denied that she benefited from any special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also found that Branch made lewd comments to another female 
employee, allegedly suggesting a possible sexual liaison. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said the grand jury is proceeding even though it is unlikely 
that such an inquiry can be completed by the June election because of its 
"complexity." The county personnel investigation took nearly three months to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just one more politically motivated attempt by the supervisors to try 
to convince Mr. Branch not to seek reelection," Charton said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Wednesday, employees in the recorder's office said that 
Branch has been meeting with workers in small groups. The meetings were 
described by one worker as "warm and friendly," with Branch pledging to open 
office communications and deal more directly with office problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's definitely not going to leave," said one employee, who asked not to be 
identified. "He thinks he will win the election."

JUDGE REMOVED FROM 2ND OVERTON MURDER TRIAL; JURISPRUDENCE: STATE APPEALS COURT 
RULES THE DEFENSE HAS THE RIGHT TO DISQUALIFY CARTER, WHO HAD PRESIDED AT THE 
FIRST ACTION, WHICH ENDED IN A MISTRIAL IN AUGUST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge David O. Carter, who has been presiding 
over the sensational Richard K. Overton murder-by-poison trial, has been 
removed from the case by a state appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
 In a unanimous decision issued Monday, the 4th District Court of Appeal 
ordered Carter to step down, ruling that a recent mistrial in the case gave the 
defense the right to ask that the judge be disqualified for possible bias. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will, of course, immediately comply with the District Court's order . . . 
and will cooperate in any way possible to expedite the retrial of this case," 
Carter said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He added the he "was blessed in having two excellent trial attorneys (in the 
aborted case). They displayed extraordinary competence and the highest 
standards of the legal profession." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the prosecutor nor Overton's attorney could be reached for comment on 
the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 The appellate court's decision sets the stage for the retrial of one of the 
county's most investigated and publicized murder cases. The trial is 
tentatively scheduled to resume Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Overton, 65, a part-time computer consultant from Dana Point, is charged in 
the Jan. 24, 1988, cyanide poisoning death of his wife, Janet, a popular 
trustee of the Capistrano Unified School District. Prosecutors allege he killed 
her because he was upset over her extramarital affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, investigators were unable to determine how Overton's wife died. Six 
months after her death, one of Overton's previous wives called investigators 
and asked if they checked for poison, alleging that he had once tried to poison 
her. Investigators re-examined the body and found traces of cyanide. 
</P>
<P>
 Overton has maintained his innocence throughout, disputing his alleged role in 
her death and has even challenged the prosecution's contention that his wife 
died from poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances of the case became even more bizarre last May when it was 
learned that a yearlong recess in the trial was caused by the mental illness of 
Overton's attorney, who charged that Overton may have tampered with evidence 
and lied on witness stand. Neither of those allegations were substantiated.  
</P>
<P>
 In a dual ruling in August, appellate justices removed the attorney and 
concluded that the unusual and lengthy delay could have caused jurors to harden 
their opinions about Overton's guilt or innocence. A mistrial was declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Overton's new attorney, George A. Peters Jr., then sought to remove Carter 
from presiding at the retrial, contending that the first trial may have 
prejudiced the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter had refused to step down, arguing that he was not biased. He also 
charged, in court, that Peters was trying to a get new judge so crucial 
arguments concerning the admission of evidence, which had gone against the 
defense, could be reheard. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter had also argued that replacing him would cause further delays and 
increase the already hefty costs associated with the case. Overton hired his 
own lawyer in his first trial, but the county is paying the cost of his defense 
in the retrial.

PACE, FORMER STANTON MAYOR, IS DISBARRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Stanton Mayor Charles (Mike) Pace has been disbarred for incompetence 
and abandoning clients, the State Bar of California announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The action, which took place Jan. 15, means that the 50-year-old Pace may no 
longer practice law.After five years he may apply for reinstatement, but such 
actions "very rarely happen," according to bar spokeswoman Kim McCready. 
</P>
<P>
 Pace could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to bar proceedings in October, 1991, Pace abandoned two clients in 
one case without performing the work he was retained to perform. After failing 
to cooperate with a bar investigation, Pace was suspended from practice and 
ordered to make restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 In a second case, the bar ruled in December, 1992, that Pace again abandoned 
clients without notification and, in addition, he failed to perform competently 
and did not inform his clients of his criminal conviction for driving under the 
influence of alcohol. For the second offense, Pace was again suspended and 
placed on three years of probation. 
</P>
<P>
 One provision of Pace's probation for the second offense was that he inform 
clients and court officials that he was being disciplined. In 1993, Pace was 
accused by the bar of failing to comply with that provision, called Rule 955. 
When summoned to defend himself against those charges, the bar said in its 
findings, Pace failed to appear at the hearing and was found guilty by default. 
</P>
<P>
 The bar examiner's recommendation of disbarment was approved by the state 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Pace was elected to the Stanton City Council in 1984, after an unsuccessful 
run in 1980, and was tapped by colleagues on the council to serve as mayor in 
1985 and 1986. The civil attorney was defeated for reelection in 1988.

CAMARO IS STOLEN AT GUNPOINT BY 3 MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three men took a gray 1985 Chevrolet Camaro from a Westminster man at gunpoint 
Tuesday, leaving the vehicle's owner unharmed, a Sheriff's Department spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The car's owner, Benito Ruiz Hernandez, 28, told police that he was approached 
by the three men as he was walking to the car, which was parked in the 8900 
block of Tina Way, about 8 p.m., said Lt. Dan Martini of the Orange County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 When the carjackers demanded his car and keys, Hernandez complied, Martini 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle, which is still missing, was last seen heading south on Magnolia 
Street, Martini said. The car's license plate number was not released.

WITNESS SAYS RAPE CHANGED VICTIM, 79; TRIAL: IN UNUSUAL TACTIC, PROSECUTORS ARE 
CHARGING DEFENDANT WITH MURDER BECAUSE WOMAN LOST HER WILL TO LIVE AND DIED A 
MONTH AFTER THE ATTACK.

<P>
 Before she was raped in her own home, 79-year-old Mary Ward was a fun-loving, 
"feisty" woman and devout Jehovah's Witness who spoke with a twang and 
entertained friends with tales about growing up in the South. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was not the same person after it happened," said Ward's friend, Marcheta 
Murphy. Before the attack "she was a card, she was always laughing. After, she 
cried a lot. She would just sit there and stare at nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy was the first witness to testify Wednesday in the murder trial of Jose 
Alonso Garcia, 20, of Stanton, who is accused of raping Ward in May, 1992, and 
causing her death one month later. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an unusual twist, prosecutors have not linked Ward's physical injuries 
to her death. Instead, prosecutors allege that Garcia murdered Ward by 
destroying her "will to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys told the jury that Ward died from undiagnosed lung cancer 
and other complications. But Deputy Dist. Atty. David La Bahn told jurors that 
the rape contributed to the widow's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was overwhelmed by shame, embarrassment and the wish that she had died 
with her husband," La Bahn said. "There's not much more you can do to an 
elderly woman than rape her in her own home. . . . Attacking her and doing what 
he did, the defendant killed her." 
</P>
<P>
 While she had some health problems and walked with a cane, Ward refused to let 
her medical conditions slow her down before the attack, Murphy testified, 
adding that Ward's attitude changed after the rape. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was an emotional wreck, she was a real mess," Murphy said. "She would 
just say, 'I'm not going to make it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor told jurors that his case will rely on medical evidence as well 
as testimony by some of the country's most renowned experts on death and dying. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics say the case could set a dangerous precedent because it explores 
areas normally left outside the courtroom, such as spiritual issues and the 
brain's role in accelerating death. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a theory that Deputy Public Defender Leonard Gumlia has denounced as 
"voodoo." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana defense attorney Ruben Salgado, a legal adviser to the Mexican 
government, has said outside of court that prosecutors are testing the novel 
legal theory on Garcia because he is an illegal immigrant. Prosecutors deny the 
allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the attack, Ward was an assistant manager at the Stanton 
apartment complex where she had lived for more than 20 years. She awoke about 
2:30 a.m. on May 22, 1992, to find Garcia splashing in the complex pool and 
went outside to order him away. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward returned to her apartment and dialed 911. Garcia followed and began 
attacking her, ultimately tearing the phone from the wall, choking her with the 
cord and holding her at knifepoint, La Bahn said. 
</P>
<P>
 As La Bahn played the chilling 911 tape, many jurors appeared uncomfortable 
listening to Ward's recorded screams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please! help! He's trying to choke me . . . hurry! Get out of here! Get out 
of here!" Ward is heard yelling. "He's on me! Get out of here! He's trying to 
rape me! Please! Help!" Ward is heard crying before the line goes dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County sheriff's deputies responding to the 911 call had to pull Garcia 
off Ward, La Bahn said. Garcia, who was drunk, later told authorities that Ward 
invited him to have sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "'I'm a man and we can't, we can't hold back when a woman wants you,"' La Bahn 
quoted Garcia as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia has admitted raping Ward, but is contesting the murder charge and four 
other sexual assault charges. If convicted, he faces life in prison without 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening statement, the defense attorney told jurors that Ward was eager 
to recover with the support of her friends and fellow churchgoers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a remarkable woman," Gumlia said. "This was not a quitter as 
portrayed by the prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
 Gumlia told jurors that doctors who failed to detect Ward's cancer made her 
condition worse by not treating it properly, ultimately causing kidney failure, 
body rashes, severe swelling and "weeping" -- a process in which backed up 
bodily fluids are released through the skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Gumlia scoffed at doctors who say the symptoms were caused by the mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is not a loss of a will to live," Gumlia said.

ARRAIGNMENTS POSTPONED IN INSURANCE FRAUD CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By E. J. GONG JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seventeen doctors and employees of nine area health clinics who face charges 
of insurance fraud and conspiracy to commit insurance fraud had their 
arraignments postponed Wednesday in Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Michael Brenner rescheduled arraignment for Feb. 23 for 
the 17 defendants, all of whom were released on their own recognizance.Their 
lawyers refused to comment after the brief court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing an 18-month investigation by the Orange County district 
attorney's office, a grand jury indicted 20 employees, including seven doctors, 
from eight clinics in Santa Ana and one clinic in Irvine for allegedly 
doctoring $59,583 in medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of those indicted have not been arrested although warrants have been 
issued, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Lupinski. 
</P>
<P>
 The undercover probe, one of the longest and most unusual in the prosecuting 
agency's history, involved setting up a "dummy" law firm that claimed to 
represent clients injured in car accidents. To attract dishonest clinics, 
investigators rented office space and posed as a fledgling personal injury 
firm, then solicited work from the clinics. The sting operation, which began in 
April, 1992, focused on the nine clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinic officials sent false bills to the firm. In theory, the firm would 
forward payment from insurance companies back to the clinics, authorities said. 
No money was paid out during the operation.

SAN CLEMENTE OKS CLIFF STABILIZATION PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Legal and financial disputes that have delayed the clearing of 
landslide-choked Pacific Coast Highway for almost a year were swept away 
Wednesday when the City Council approved a partnership agreement that defines 
who will pay for shoring up the unstable cliffs above the heavily traveled 
roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 The pact's key element is a $200,000 loan from the city to the eight property 
owners on La Ventana whose homes were damaged or destroyed in the February, 
1993, landslide. The money would cover the cliff stabilization project. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the agreement without comment, 4 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement removes a major obstacle to the clearing of the highway. 
However, it will still take several months before the first shovelful of dirt 
is removed, Dana Point officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal funding that will pay for the bulk of the work won't be available 
until September, said Andy Anderson, Dana Point's emergency services 
coordinator. Dana Point officials hope Pacific Coast Highway will reopen by 
June, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The devastating slide ruined five bluff-top homes in San Clemente and put 
three others in jeopardy as it dumped 44,000 tons of rubble onto the highway in 
Dana Point. It also started a nearly yearlong dispute between La Ventana 
homeowners and the two cities over responsibility for restoring the cliffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in both cities have said that some homeowners believed the cities 
should pay restoration costs. The homeowners refused to sign liability waivers 
over the excavation work needed to clear the highway and shore up the cliffs, 
the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 La Ventana residents dispute the cities' version of events. They claim 
officials in Dana Point and San Clemente pressured them to sign away rights to 
sue over the original landslide before Dana Point would begin any restoration 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Tired of waiting for the liability waivers to be signed, Dana Point won state 
Coastal Commission permission in November to clean up the highway without 
stabilizing the cliffs. Dana Point officials had planned to install a wall to 
protect the road from future slides. 
</P>
<P>
 But San Clemente City Manager Michael W. Parness said residents indicated they 
would file suit to prevent Dana Point from clearing the highway without also 
shoring up the 75-foot-high cliffs. 
</P>
<P>
 However, all eight La Ventana property owners whose residences were either 
destroyed or threatened by the landslide later decided to sign the waivers, 
said Peter Shikli, who has acted as a spokesman for the homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the 20-year loan, residents will hold the cities blameless 
over any damage caused by the restoration work, but are free to sue over the 
February, 1993, landslide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dana Point City Council is scheduled to vote on the joint agreement at its 
meeting Tuesday.

THE SCENE: SWINGING TO A DIFFERENT DRUMMER; IT'S NOT JUST THE CLOTHES THEY 
WEAR. OR THE BIG BAND MUSIC THEY DIG. THERE WILL ALWAYS BE TEENS WHO FOLLOW THE 
CROWD. BUT IT'S THE SPIRIT OF DOING THEIR OWN THING THAT MAKES THESE ORANGE 
COUNTY CATS COOL.

<P>
 Weird is relative. 
</P>
<P>
 Take opalescent purple eye shadow and Tammy Faye eyelashes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-'80s, every "cool" girl at my high school glopped on the goo. I was 
strictly into black liquid eyeliner and bright red lips -- the Audrey Hepburn 
look. The makeup matched my bouffant 'do and the layers of starched petticoats 
that I wore under my full skirts. (The teacher in my Traffic and Safety driving 
class wasn't real happy that the ensemble covered my feet and spilled over onto 
his side, making it nearly impossible for him to see the car's pedals.) 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, only a handful of students at Fountain Valley High appeared in 
attire fit for the set of "West Side Story." Two of them were my best friends. 
</P>
<P>
 We shunned the tattered, Gothic-inspired fashions and gender-bending looks 
along with the New Wave music it garnished. We were into roots rock and sharp 
dressing. So it's understandable why grunge and all its flannel charm, or the 
phat style of hip-hop, doesn't appeal to every teen today.  
</P>
<P>
 Take Fountain Valley senior Mark Vukadinovich. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't own a pair of jeans. He's strictly into slacks and has a great 
collection of vintage Hawaiian shirts. He slicks his 'do a la Elvis -- whose 
movies he loves because they're so campy. 
</P>
<P>
 He prefers the big band music of Benny Goodman and Count Basie to the grunge 
rock of Kurt Cobain and Eddie Vedder. A guitarist for the past six years, his 
idols aren't Eddie Van Halen or Soundgarden's Kim Thayill, but big band 
strummers Charlie Christian and Eddie Lang.  
</P>
<P>
 But the fact that Vukadinovich prefers cruising in his '55 Hudson Rambler and 
playing the coffeehouse circuit in his swing band, Duke Diamond and the 
Gemtones, doesn't exclude him from "cool one" status. (The nine-member band 
performs Saturday night at Our House Coffeehouse in Costa Mesa). 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of people are afraid to be associated with anything their 
parents or grandparents are into," says the 17-year-old. To learn more about 
the '40s, he quizzes his grandparents about the dance halls in Chicago they 
frequented when they were teens. 
</P>
<P>
 To experience these sounds live, he and his buddies have either had to cruise 
to nightclubs in Hollywood or sneak into shows that prohibit minors. The Orange 
International Street Fair and the now-defunct 8 1/2, an underage club in 
Fullerton, have offered some relief by booking local bands such as Big Sandy 
and the Fly-Rite Boys and the Royal Crown Review. 
</P>
<P>
 He first started experimenting with vintage music two years ago with his 
previous band, Burning Lust, which cranked out psychobilly, an intensely 
raucous form of rockabilly, itself a form of early rock 'n' roll that borrows 
from country and hillbilly (think of "Blue Suede Shoes"). Burning Lust jammed 
until the end of last summer, when Vukadinovich's band mates moved on to 
college. He then decided to toy with the big band sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom doesn't really care for swing," he adds. "She'll turn my music off and 
put on her Beatles records." 
</P>
<P>
 The only one at his school who dresses like someone out of a black-and-white 
flick, Vukadinovich says that "every once in a while a football player or 
someone like that will be sarcastic about something I'm wearing, like 'oh, nice 
tie.' "  
</P>
<P>
 That attitude only seems to encourage him. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're dressed up, you can totally tell they're making fun of you," says 
Vukadinovich's band mate Stephen Derrick, a senior at Ocean View High. "I get a 
kick out of it. Like I'm supposed to get upset because some heavy metal guy is 
making fun of me."  
</P>
<P>
 (For my girlfriends and me, our favorite response to close-minded statements 
by jocks was blowing a kiss in the air followed by a mocking apology that we 
didn't resemble their goopy-eyed girlfriends.) 
</P>
<P>
 Derrick got into the hep cat sounds of the '40s and '50s in his freshman year 
when he first locked into jazz station KLON-FM (88.1). 
</P>
<P>
 "I then went through my dad's records," he said. During the mid-'60s when he 
was in high school, Derrick's father played trumpet and was into big band -- an 
extreme contrast to the long-haired scene his peers were into then. 
</P>
<P>
 Like father, like son. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This current fascination with gas-guzzling classic cars, tailored vintage 
fashions and jumpin' tunes of the '40s and '50s re-emerged in the late '60s 
with the greasy teddy boys. It returned again in full form in the late '70s and 
boomed in the early '80s when yours truly delved into it. The latest 
incarnation counts die-hards from the past decade and the new blood of teens 
such as Derrick and his small network of friends at various high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 There's only a couple of other guys at Ocean View who dig swing, and Derrick 
hangs out with them both. One is Michael Huff, 18, who plays trombone for the 
Gemtones. The senior decided to take up the horn when he recently tuned into 
jazz. He just rented the instrument and got a book. His knowledge of notes 
comes from five years of piano lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 He got into horns when his 15-year-old brother, Chris, picked up the trumpet a 
year ago. The brothers blow the brass side by side in the Gemtones and hit jazz 
shows together whenever they can.  
</P>
<P>
 "I want to expand the horn section even more," says the older Huff. " Someday 
I'd like to lead a real big band and have a full 11- to 12-piece horn section." 
 
</P>
<P>
 Michael started dressing the part this year, first by chopping off his 
Beatlesque bob into a neat pomp. "To me it was a big deal," he recalls. "It was 
a lot of hair I got rid of."  
</P>
<P>
 Like other retro buffs, Huff and his friends raid local thrift stores for 
anything that appears pre-1960, in contrast to most high school students into 
alternative scenes who tend to don a second-hand melange of '60s and '70s duds. 
</P>
<P>
 Huff's first vintage item was a pair of wing tips he got at Savers in 
Huntington Beach, considered a gem of a source among local hipsters. "There and 
my dad's closet are my two good places for clothes," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He and the others say they like wearing vintage clothes, especially the suits, 
because when they do, they're standing out and not conforming. "I'm doing what 
I want to do because that's what I want to do and not because it's what's cool 
or popular at the time," Huff says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Style is missing in clothing today," Derrick adds. "Dressing back then meant 
looking sharp, sophisticated, looking good. Men looked cleaner, debonair. It's 
not popular to do that now." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the handsome appeal of yesteryear, he also loves the way women wore 
their hair and makeup. "I don't care for short skirts." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's good news for Huntington Beach senior Daiquiri Scherer, 18 -- and bad 
news for her family. "My grandma wishes I'd wear mini skirts and that I'd stop 
wearing clunky shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 Scherer plugged into the scene two years ago, when her interest in vintage 
vehicles grew. As a kid, she and her four older brothers would get money from 
their father if they could guess the make of an antique car. She came out on 
top last summer when she got dad's 1941 Mercury. "My dad's had it for 20 years, 
and it was already planned that I'd drive it. I ended up being the only one who 
liked old cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides swing, she listens to rockabilly and golden oldies. But even though 
she loves movies and music from the '50s, she says: "The '40s era I find more 
appealing. The clothes and cars were classier." 
</P>
<P>
 She loves vintage rayon dresses because "they flatter the body. I feel like a 
lady." After Katharine Hepburn's famous style, she also loves wearing men's 
trousers. There are also gloves, hats and a pair of cat eye glasses in her 
wardrobe, although she doesn't wear those items every day.  
</P>
<P>
 Like Vukadinovich at FVHS, Scherer was recently voted "most unique" for the 
yearbook. It's a bittersweet title, considering some of the comments they've 
endured for the way they look. But it's part of being different, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, fans of Duke Diamond and the Gemtones, who attend many of the high 
schools in the area, are for the most part, the "weird" kids at school who 
prefer coffeehouses to Friday night parties where all the "popular" people go. 
Still, their audience likes the music but doesn't care much about the clothes 
or the cars. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's cool, because it's a matter of being open to different scenes, 
Derrick says. "To me, anyway, it's more about the spirit of the music than the 
fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 Even louder than the music, it's the spirit of doing their own thing that 
swings for these cats.

BOOKS & AUTHORS: KOONTZ EXPECTS A HOLLYWOOD ENDING; THE NEWPORT BEACH MASTER OF 
SUSPENSE HAS REASON TO BE WARY OF FILM ADAPTATIONS, BUT HE'S OPTIMISTIC, 
ESPECIALLY ABOUT 'HIDEAWAY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Suspense-thriller master Dean Koontz says he's "deliriously" happy that Jeff 
Goldblum has been cast to play the lead in the movie version of "Hideaway," 
Koontz's 1992 bestseller about a dead man who is surgically "reanimated," then 
finds himself under the spell of an evil force. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minute he came on board, it raised the quality of the project: It became 
a more major picture," said Koontz, 48. "Jeff Goldblum is widely regarded in 
the industry as an actor, not just a star."  
</P>
<P>
 Koontz -- who creates his string of national No. 1 bestsellers in a hilltop 
mansion overlooking Newport Beach -- said that as soon as news leaked that 
Goldblum had been cast, the caliber of actors who wanted to work in the film 
grew considerably higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is all kinds of talk," he said, "and there is some competition for the 
female lead -- any one of which I'd be happy to see." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Koontz won't say who's vying for the role of Goldblum's wife in the film, but 
an even more crucial piece of casting has yet to be done: the role of Vassago, 
the satanic force who hides the bodies of his victims in the bowels of an 
abandoned amusement park east of San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Koontz has a suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody who is very appealing but also just instantly gives you that sense 
of danger about them," he said. "When I was writing it I sort of pictured a 
young Jack Nicholson with sunglasses on." 
</P>
<P>
 Although "Hideaway' is set primarily in Orange County, the movie will begin 
production late this month in Vancouver, where, Koontz says, lower production 
costs "can make a $16 million budget look like $20 million." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hideaway" is being produced for Tri-Star by actor Dennis Quaid and his 
partner, Cathleen Summers. Koontz said he hasn't read the latest draft of the 
screenplay. But the most recent writer attached to the project is Neal Jimenez, 
whose credits include "River's Edge" and "The Waterdance" and who, Koontz said, 
"is considered first-rate at developing characters on screen."  
</P>
<P>
 Koontz said the film's young director, Brett Leonard, is considered "visually 
brilliant." But that didn't stop Koontz from initially being less than 
confident in the selection of Leonard, whose credits include "Lawnmower Man" 
and music videos. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got the talent to really visualize things, but there are other things 
required in bringing out the best performance in actors," Koontz said. "I was a 
little concerned he'd turn this into a bloody sort of genre film, but I know 
his intention is to make an 'A' picture, and now I think he may do a very good 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to Hollywood's treatment of his books, Koontz has reason to be 
leery. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of his nearly 60 novels have been translated to the screen. And he hasn't 
been entirely pleased with the results. 
</P>
<P>
 Koontz said "Watchers" (1988), "Servants of Twilight" and "Whispers" (1990) 
were made into "dreadful" films. But he views "Demon Seed," a 1977 film 
starring Julie Christie, a "decent movie." And he was pleased with the 1990 TV 
movie of "The Face of Fear" -- as well he should be: He wrote the screenplay 
and served as executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Face of Fear" was one of four of his novels intended to be produced by 
Warner Bros. for CBS television. But after producing "The Face of Fear," plans 
for TV-movie versions of "Eyes of Darkness," "Night Chills" and "Darkfall" were 
scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
 "That project became so difficult and so much of a hassle that the producer on 
it, Lee Rich, suggested that to push any of these forward I'd have to commit to 
the same level of involvement I had on 'Face of Fear,' which was much more 
intense than I initially thought it would be and I said, 'No.'  
</P>
<P>
 "Working in television is a nightmare. It was just too much work for the 
return. During the pre-production, shooting and post production I literally was 
working in the neighborhood of 100 hours a week. I just couldn't see doing that 
from project after project." 
</P>
<P>
 Koontz has two other novels in development -- "Phantoms" and "Dragon Tears" -- 
and he recently sold his 1993 bestseller, "Mr. Murder," to Savoy Pictures for a 
"seven-figure" sum. 
</P>
<P>
 Savoy Pictures, which produced "Shadowlands" and "A Bronx Tale," will begin 
production on "Mr. Murder" next year. But most significantly for Koontz, he 
will serve as executive producer and have approval over the selection of writer 
and director.  
</P>
<P>
 " 'Mr. Murder,' " he said, "is going to be very much an 'A' picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has written screenplays for "The Face of Fear" and two unproduced 
screenplays ("Midnight" and "The Bad Place"), Koontz finds screenwriting too 
collaborative a process for his liking: "You have to satisfy 16 people, many of 
whom are executives in the studio system and not necessarily creative. Many 
times suggestions conflict with one another and you're supposed to incorporate 
all of them." 
</P>
<P>
 He also has fielded numerous offers to write original screenplays or screen 
adaptations. But, he said, "I just turn them down because I'd rather write an 
original of my own and not contract for it first." 
</P>
<P>
 But to do that, he said, he has to find the time between books. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Koontz has been hard at work on the first novel in his reported $18 to 
$20 million three-book deal with Alfred A. Knopf and Ballantine Books. The 
book, tentatively titled "Dark Rivers of the Heart," will be out in the fall 
and is already being shopped around Hollywood by his agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Both he and his publishers consider it the best thing he's done, and, he said, 
unlike in his previous novels, there is no element of the fantastic in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's a mark of how strange our modern world is that even a piece without 
fantasy is stranger than one with," he said, adding that "the book deals with 
some issue that Knopf and Ballantine think will be very controversial. I think 
so too, and that's going to be a new experience for me. There will be a very 
strong pro and con reaction to the book. I'll be damned in some places and 
praised in others." 
</P>
<P>
 Koontz said the last four of the nine months he spent working on the new novel 
"was the worst and best involvement I ever had with a book. I started at 7 in 
the morning and worked till 11 at night with a two-hour dinner break." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the incentive of landing lucrative deals with Hollywood for his 
novels, Koontz said the movies are the last thing on his mind when he sits down 
at his computer to write. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, you never know what they're going to want," he said. "The best 
thing is to do what you're passionate about and that passion comes through to 
them and they react to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Koontz acknowledges that he is a visual writer -- a trait that makes his books 
amenable to being transferred to the screen -- "but that's just the way I am. I 
see things in my head when I'm working on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always felt I like a reader to be immersed in a scene -- to see it, 
taste it, smell it: to have all their senses impacted by it. In that sense 
sometimes people will respond to it as being cinematic, but that's only what I 
think is good writing."

 Kids are pulling together for a cleaner planet -- with needles and thread. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids for a Clean Environment (a.k.a. Kids FACE) is sewing what they hope will 
be the world's largest kid-made flag, reports 3-2-1-Contact magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, kids from all over the world have been sending decorated cotton 
squares for the flag. Each 12-inch square has an eco-friendly message, such as 
Please Recycle. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Kids FACE has sewn together 3,000 squares. And they're still sewing. 
</P>
<P>
 They hope to have the giant flag waving in front of the White House by April 
21, 1995 -- the 25th anniversary of Earth Day.

A PATH TO DISCOVERY; FORCED ONTO SURFACE STREETS SOUTH OF THE SANTA MONICA 
FREEWAY, DRIVERS MAY FIND NEIGHBORHOODS OF DIVERSITY AND CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNELL GEORGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As commuters have digested the fact that they have no choice but to come down 
from the trestles that for decades have carried them over the urban grid, many 
for the first time will glimpse an unfamiliar L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past two weeks, people waiting for elevators, over dinner tables or 
in line at the supermarket have begun to trade routes and guarded shortcuts. 
They compare them like top-of-the-line consumer items, speculating over which 
will provide the best performance. 
</P>
<P>
 On one level, the region's intricate freeway system "speedily" connected the 
city. But on another, it kept communities far apart. With the mighty 10 down, 
one Westsider says, moving south from Pico to Adams, "doesn't mean crossing 
into another world. Now people have to see and talk to one another." 
</P>
<P>
 As Angelenos travel thoroughfares north and south of the Santa Monica Freeway, 
through neighborhoods they haven't seen for years or never before, the 
inconvenience could, some optimists believe, offer a long-overdue education 
about a rapidly altering region. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars became the mobile, air-controlled living room, the cushion from what 
thrived or died in a blur outside tinted glass. It's human nature to stick to 
what one knows, but as time passes and gridlock intensifies, radio announcers 
are imploring commuters to divert from already heavily traveled Wilshire, Santa 
Monica and Olympic boulevards and to use the streets that lie south of the 
shattered I-10 -- Adams, Jefferson, Exposition -- or its nearest northern 
corridor, Washington Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first few days of the new commute, some considered the alternatives 
tentatively. The reservations were two-pronged: Some commuters, unfamiliar with 
certain stretches, felt a tinge of uneasiness, and some store owners and 
neighborhood residents considered the headache of more traffic, noise and air 
pollution on streets that have long remained an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
 Those concerned about the traffic flow (and the safety of children who may 
play along the residential stretches of these boulevards) may find that the 
rerouting could pay off in other ways: long-overdue upgraded roads, street 
lights and possibly wider exposure and a new clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 And for those willing to stray from their well-beaten paths, and keep their 
eyes open, the results can quite possibly be far-reaching or at least edifying 
-- from the richness of diversity to the long-term effects of neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 Cataclysmic events such as earthquakes only underscore how little some 
Angelenos know their city. Or how uncomfortable they are just trying to get to 
know it. 
</P>
<P>
 Case in point: After receiving directions that included a jumble of 
south-of-Pico surface streets and then a quick spin on the brand-new 105 
Freeway, a woman thanked her old colleague but quipped, brow knitted: "I'm just 
afraid to go that far south. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first post-quake week, a salesman at a Westside Circuit City outlet 
said cellular-phone sales jumped to life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although people are often surprised at how much they cost to buy, let alone 
to use them, we've sold a considerable number of phones," he said of a 50% 
sales increase just days after the quake, and asking not to be identified. 
People observed that the system was operative after the quake when their home 
phones weren't, he said. But, he added, there is also the safety factor: "My 
own wife now has to drive a different path to Pasadena. I want her to feel 
secure." 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Camargo, a spokesman for L.A. Cellular, concurred: "They primarily want 
them for peace of mind. . . . We're starting to see a pattern. . . . Certainly 
after the riots of '92, we saw a distinct increase. After the earthquakes, 
we're seeing another spike." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Levi Kingston, who heads the Jefferson Boulevard-adjacent Community 
Consortium, wants something done about perceptions. He notes that after the 
riots, more than two dozen events were canceled at the Shrine Auditorium near 
USC, and he is concerned about the long-lingering effect on bookings at 
neighboring venues such as the Sports Arena and the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingston says the riots ultimately tainted the surrounding community's 
reputation: "So the question becomes, what are people around here -- the powers 
that be -- doing about it? To change the image of this area? Are they having an 
aggressive campaign? The answer is no. There hasn't been any work done. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that the human-relation issues need to be raised now, as more 
commuters enter the area, because people will be in situations where their own 
fear can trigger situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Some merchants along the new commute routes expect little but heavy traffic 
that will only congest their neighborhoods and contribute more wear and tear on 
already stressed streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't expect more business," says Acie Sims, manager of Mr. B's Box, a post 
office and stationer on West Jefferson Boulevard. "I expect even less. My 
regular clients, mostly older people are pretty shook up and staying home, 
while the new people are just on their way through." 
</P>
<P>
 Although not blindly optimistic, not everyone is so hopeless about the 
arrangement. Ruan Sen Lei, owner of the Chinese Deli, says smilingly that 
increased traffic has translated into more business. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the bumper-to-bumper ride, more business comes not just into view, but 
into sharp focus. Stop to peruse Jefferson's eclectic offerings: the First 
Church of Rasta, Dashiki Chili Hut, or Barry's International Barber and Record 
Shop "featuring the latest in Calypso, Soca, Reggae, American and Funk." 
</P>
<P>
 And the broad expanse of stately Adams Boulevard wears, like epaulets on its 
shoulders, not only the famous regal California Craftsmans, but a noble stretch 
of churches of many denominations, from a Polish Roman Catholic Church and 
Holman United Methodist to a sprinkling of Korean parishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Courtney Minors, owner of Kulcha Beat Records at Washington Boulevard and 
Harcourt Avenue, has a specialized business, featuring hard-to-find ska, 
rock-steady and reggae CDs, records and videos. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't depend on cars driving by," Minors says, "but we do need more 
business in this area." Minors, a native of Jamaica, says many artists have 
taken advantage of the ornate yet run-down storefronts and the relatively 
inexpensive square footage. "And that's cool, but because they are hidden, it 
doesn't really benefit the community. If we had a lot of businesses regularly 
open, it would be a Melrose." 
</P>
<P>
 People are surviving, he says, "but we need develop a sense of community. Get 
rid of those bars. It makes the place look like a prison camp. . . . People 
look at the bars and say: 'This must be a bad neighborhood.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Minors says he's long been nurturing a plan that might have just found its 
time: to create colorful banners to hang down Southwest L.A.'s major 
thoroughfares that could coax passers-by to: "Bring your business HERE!" 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe that people just gave up on this street," he says, ringing up 
a cassette sale. "They just got scared." 
</P>
<P>
 James Burks, director of the William Grant Still Cultural Center on West View 
Street, a half-block north of Adams, says that, in a way, the downed freeways 
and subsequent re-routings are a blessing: "People are finally going to see 
their ethnic community." 
</P>
<P>
 Communities south of the I-10, he observes, have often been either overlooked 
or painted with a broad, dismal brush: 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, people will realize that we need to upgrade these areas. Plant trees, 
not pour blacktop. But they will find out that the streets are not all burned 
out. There are lawns and houses. People don't have to panic waiting for the 
light to change. They will realize that people are not being mugged or 
carjacked. We are all a working community. Children play in the yards. People 
walk their dogs." 
</P>
<P>
 Burks plans to put signs along Adams, maybe assemble some street musicians to 
soothe commuters' nerves as well as alert them to the Center, which presents 
rotating exhibitions, plays, concerts, art classes and poetry workshops. 
</P>
<P>
 "This city is culturally diverse, so why not promote that cultural diversity?" 
Burks asks. "It's just as important for a city to have a cultural 
infrastructure. Hold it in higher esteem. These freeways insulated people. I 
think somebody is trying to tell us something."

MAGAZINE SINGS TUNE OF AGING ROCK FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KAYE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Being a middle-aged rock-music fan can be demeaning. 
</P>
<P>
 Songs that roused your passion 25 years ago are thrown back in your face as 
advertising jingles for things like prune juice and pantyhose. The birthdays of 
every '60s pop icon -- many of whom are approaching their own 60s -- are noted 
publicly with amazement and titters. 
</P>
<P>
 And, sure, you can read about Buffalo Tom and Smashing Pumpkins in Rolling 
Stone and Spin. But these are clearly not publications aimed at you. Consider 
the extraordinary frequency with which editions of Rolling Stone are labeled 
"Special Campus Issue." 
</P>
<P>
 With legions of aging rockers out there and no music publication tailored to 
their interests, there has been a gap in the publishing market that seems 
strikingly obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obvious," that is, now that someone has done something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 In Great Britain, the recent launch of a magazine called Mojo may mark the 
first major rock publication for 30- and 40-somethings. 
</P>
<P>
 At its heart, Mojo is designed for serious fans of rock music, regardless of 
age. But its content, the magazines's editors and advertisers say, is certain 
to attract a mainly grown-up readership. 
</P>
<P>
 Mojo "tends to focus on those artists in whom people people have an especially 
large emotional investment," says editor Paul Du Noyer, 39. "It's pitched at 
people with a deep interest in music and I would expect the majority of those 
to be older." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the magazine is devoted to well-researched New Yorker-length articles 
about artists and events spanning the history of rock. Unlike other music 
journals, Mojo feels no need to peg its articles to new record releases or 
upcoming tour dates. It is more about historical perspective and cultural 
context. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine's November launch issue featured a 19-page cover story about the 
influence Bob Dylan and the Beatles had on each other. Included in the massive 
package were interviews with Paul McCartney and George Harrison reflecting on 
their connections with Dylan, and a transcript of a taped -- and utterly 
bizarre -- conversation between Dylan and John Lennon as they rode around 
London in the back of a limo at 5 a.m. on May 25, 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the first issue was a 15-page overview of Van Morrison, plus articles 
on more recent arrivals to the music scene such as Mary-Chapin Carpenter and 
the Lemonheads. 
</P>
<P>
 The current issue features 12 pages on the musical history of the Sunset Strip 
("Sleazy Street: L.A.'s Fabled Boulevard of Rock 'n' Roll Dreams"), a 
comprehensive package on the Band, an 18-page photo study of blues greats and 
articles about Rick Wakeman, Carlos Santana, Pink Floyd and current British 
media darlings, Suede. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not interested in nostalgia for a particular period," says Du Noyer. 
"We're just interested in music that we think is so good it exists outside of 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial success is not a prerequisite for an artist's inclusion. The world 
of Mojo is a place where Captain Beefheart is a cultural force of such 
significance that he rates a 16-page spread encompassing a main article and six 
related stories. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Beefheart has not released an album in nearly 12 years is 
irrelevant. Mojo is there to give the California composer and musician ("Trout 
Mask Replica," 1969) his due. 
</P>
<P>
 Advertising executives already are bullish on the magazine and are eyeing it 
as a way to reach upscale adult readers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Mojo is going to be a big success," says Rupert Price, media planner 
at Young & Rubicam in London. "It's very high quality. They manage to get their 
hands on rare photographs. Obsessive readers will collect the magazines like 
they do the records." 
</P>
<P>
 Price notes that Mojo is reaching readers "up to 50," adding, "Mick Jagger's 
that age." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the optimism about Mojo is that the publishing company and 
editors behind it previously achieved success with a similar venture. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, the British media group EMAP launched Q, a magazine for music fans 
who were too old for the teen-age quirkiness of the music press. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuffed with stylish articles on a wide range of artists, along with pages and 
pages of reviews, Q's popularity grew rapidly. Piggybacking on the explosion in 
compact disc sales, Q offered innovative features designed to appeal to CD 
consumers. As record companies reissued classic albums on CD, Q published 
CD-sized "sleeve notes" about the music and artists. Readers could then clip 
out the notes and place them in the disc boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until then, nobody was catering for anybody over the age of 23," says Mark 
Ellen, the 39-year-old founding editor of Q, who is now managing editor of 
Mojo. "The idea seemed to be that you stopped listening to rock when you turned 
23. You took up opera and golf." 
</P>
<P>
 Q now sells nearly 200,000 copies a month -- a fantastic number for Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Mojo was conceived when Ellen and Du Noyer, also a former editor of Q, decided 
they wanted to take the concept further. 
</P>
<P>
 "It began about a year ago when I was still editing Q," says Du Noyer. "A few 
of us were getting frustrated in that we couldn't always devote sufficient 
space to certain subjects. The reason is that, in UK terms, Q is a big 
commercial magazine and is obliged to pick up a wide range of artists to 
maintain its commercial profile. If you cover a lot of people, you can't cover 
anyone in great depth." 
</P>
<P>
 Du Noyer thought up the new magazine's title. "I fixed on the name Mojo simply 
because it seemed to me to represent some of the mystery that's part of rock 
music," he says. "To this day, I haven't got the vaguest idea what a mojo is. 
It's a blues term from the South. But what I like about it is you don't quite 
know what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 (In fact, mojo is African-Creole voodoo slang for an object that brings luck 
or supernatural powers.) 
</P>
<P>
 Mojo has not been distributed in the United States yet. But starting with the 
March issue, 1,500 copies a month will be flown to the United States and sold 
at selected bookstores and newsstands, including some in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 With Mojo's sales already exceeding the 40,000 it needs to turn a profit, its 
future looks good. And that begs the question whether we will ever see the next 
logical step -- rock-music magazines for people in their 60s and 70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, you can only go back as far as people who were teen-agers in the 
1950s, when rock and roll began," says ad executive Price. That translates to 
people now in their 50s. 
</P>
<P>
 "But as they turn 60 and 70," he says, "you could conceivably put out a 
magazine that reflects that."

<TEXT>
<P>
 Life in high school is more than hitting the books and going out on Saturday 
nights. In fact, Orange County teen-agers are involved in a wide variety of 
school and community activities that enrich others' lives as well as their own. 
From raising money to feeding the homeless to tutoring other students, here's a 
sampling of how some of them have gotten involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Goble, 14 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County High School of the Arts, Los Alamitos When Gary dances, it's 
with purpose. In fact, he has raised more than $7,500 to help the homeless by 
staging benefit dance performances involving himself and other students. About 
four years ago, while running an errand for his mother, he ran into a group of 
homeless people who asked for money. Gary had none to give, but the encounter 
changed his life. "I wanted to help people who couldn't help themselves," Gary 
said. On his 12th birthday, he put his plan in action, seeking supporters. In 
April, 1992, Gary and 10 friends held the first benefit concert in Westminster, 
and several have since followed. The group now has a name: Stepping Out for 
Shelter.

 senior, Santiago High, Garden Grove Samantha volunteers at Pacific Haven 
Convalescent Home in Garden Grove, talking with seniors, painting and polishing 
their nails, calling out bingo numbers, helping them cook and guiding them from 
place to place in their wheelchairs. She also volunteers at a Fountain Valley 
hospital and has been involved with the Girls' Club Clinton Elementary Tutoring 
Program, helping children with their studies. Samantha said she began 
volunteering to enhance her college prospects but now volunteers because of the 
emotional rewards.

<P>
 Coleen Redmond, 14 
</P>
<P>
 freshman, Rosary High, Fullerton Coleen has been involved with Amnesty 
International for about a year and is hoping to establish a chapter at her 
school. She became involved in the group after attending a concert by U2, which 
supports the group's efforts to protect basic human rights throughout the 
world. "Amnesty International has taught me to become a world citizen. It has 
taught me that the world doesn't revolve around me . . . and how valuable my 
rights are," Coleen said.

 senior, Century High, Santa Ana Anabel is president of Santa Ana Volunteer 
Youth (SAVVY), a school organization dedicated to helping the poor. The group 
collects clothes for the needy, distributes food to the hungry, visits a 
convalescent hospital monthly -- sometimes taking residents on field trips. In 
addition to the ongoing projects, the group also helps provide meals and other 
items for families during the holidays. Anabel's interest in SAVVY began when 
she was a freshman and helped raise funds for it; she has since contributed 
countless hours to her community through its projects.

 senior, Santa Ana High, Santa Ana As student government president, Maria has 
worked to continue a tradition of students' pooling resources to help others. 
She has helped collect and deliver food to the families of students on campus 
who are homeless and been a part of efforts to work with the Bright Light 
Center in Santa Ana. She has been involved in efforts to remove graffiti and 
clean up trash. Maria is taking part in the Peer Assistance Leader program in 
which students learn mediation techniques to resolve conflicts. She plans to 
study psychology in college and return to Santa Ana to work with children.

since she was 5 years old and pulled a drowning girl from the water. She has 
been a volunteer since seventh grade with the Orange County chapter of the 
American Red Cross and acts as the emergency services contact between her 
school and the Red Cross. She is on the Red Cross youth council executive board 
and is the leadership development conference liaison. She recently acted as 
youth coordinator for the fifth annual Orange County HIV/AIDS awareness poster 
contest.

on San Clemente High School student Steve Woods last fall that resulted in 
Woods' death, Michael revived his school's "Green Ribbon Campaign," which is 
designed to stop gang violence on school campuses and in the community. As 
commissioner of communications at Huntington Beach High, Michael set about to 
inform the student body of the destructive consequences of gang violence and 
how to stop violence with positive influence. Michael rallied support for the 
campaign by passing out buttons and stickers during "Green Ribbon Week."

A LUCKY START TO CHINESE NEW YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY TSENG, Judy Tseng is a sophomore at Troy High School in Fullerton. This 
article, recounting past New Year's Day celebrations, first appeared in the 
student newspaper, the Oracle. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometime between taking a bite of white clumped rice and passing the steamed 
fish, I realized that even small actions like these could determine my destiny 
in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Chinese superstition, that is. Chinese New Year's Day, Feb. 10, 
is a date that signifies the beginning of the 10th year in the cycle of the 
Chinese calendar, the Year of the Dog. Rather than being just a twist on zodiac 
astrology, the Chinese New Year -- and the new year in a number of other 
cultures -- is based on a lunar calendar. The calendar is based on the phases 
of the moon, which signaled to the ancient farmers when to plant and when to 
harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese New Year's Day traditionally falls on the day after the crops are all 
harvested, when it is a time to feast on the plentiful abundance that hard work 
has produced and secure a new start for another lucky year. 
</P>
<P>
 The plate of fish in my hand, covered with green onion and ginger, is 
traditionally cooked whole even though there is a risk of an eyeball dislodging 
and rolling across the plate as it is served. The fish represents prosperity in 
the coming year, and no matter how little it is, there is always meat left on 
the plate to symbolize abundance so great that there are leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Other foods eaten on Chinese New Year's Day include boiled baby spinach plants 
that have to be consumed in one bite, roots and all, even if the mouthful makes 
soy sauce dribble down your chin. The spinach plants represent longevity, and 
biting one in two would be cutting your life short. Eating glutinous desserts 
made from sweet rice flour gives "sweet" success in your job or work in the 
year to come. 
</P>
<P>
 The real work begins on the night before the Chinese New Year commences. 
During that evening, the entire house must be thoroughly cleaned for a fresh 
start in the new year, and all preparations must be made for the feast and 
festivities the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you do any work on the first day of the new year, even if you pick up a 
broom," my mother said, wagging her finger at me, "that means your entire year 
will be filled with hard, unfulfilling labor." 
</P>
<P>
 Though relaxing during the day does not necessarily guarantee a vacation 
during the entire year, it is a time where children can play and be as naughty 
as they want without being subject to their parents' disapproval. Any anger or 
unhappiness expressed on New Year's Day will mean strife between family members 
for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Much like an American holiday, keeping peace in the household becomes 
difficult when it involves the gathering of family and relatives for a feast. 
Once again, however, the children gain an advantage because each relative 
presents them with an elongated, perfumed red envelope embossed with gold 
Chinese characters for luck and fortune. Red, the traditional color 
representing luckiness, complements the gold printing, which stands for gold 
and wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon carefully lifting the edge of a red envelope, a child discovers that the 
inside is filled with crisp, new money and best wishes from his or her elders 
for the upcoming year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With money in hand and a sweet taste in their mouths from eating desserts, the 
family then piles into the car, careful not to let arguments ensue about who is 
to sit in the front seat, to head for a Chinatown, where the annual Chinese 
Dragon Parade takes place. 
</P>
<P>
 The dragon, a long, snake-like beast with colored scales as variable as the 
rainbow, is supported by a file of men who duck, dive and zigzag down the 
street to animate a dragon chasing a large white pearl, another symbol of 
wealth. Its head, with a green snout and fiery eyes, wags and shakes as it 
parades a crooked path. The surrounding crowd waves and cheers at the dragon's 
awkward movements in reaching the pearl, then laughs when the pearl slips out 
from under its nose again. 
</P>
<P>
 In conjunction with an old Chinese legend, strings of noisy red firecrackers 
are set off simultaneously with the discord of the drums and cymbals of the 
parade. 
</P>
<P>
 The tradition of igniting firecrackers on the first day of Chinese New Year is 
said to have originated as an attempt by a widow to save her toddler son from a 
ravenous marine beast that came each New Year's Day to feast on the humans of a 
seaside village. The mother scared off the beast by setting off fireworks made 
of bamboo and yelling as she banged on pots and pans. 
</P>
<P>
 The same clanging sound with glass upon glass startles me out of my reverie 
and, lifting my cup with my family around the table, we toast the New Year with 
goodwill greetings. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as my attention focuses on the faces surrounding me, the thought remains 
that if one auspicious day could actually become a prediction of the future, 
then I would indeed have a very lucky year.

ETHNIC CONCERTS WILL BE HARD TO FIND AT CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ethnic music and dance will have a lower profile at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center in the coming season. But the executive director of the 
Orange County Philharmonic Society, which books the hall, says it's more a 
result of scheduling conflicts than a replay of last season's philosophical 
conflicts with now-departed center management. 
</P>
<P>
 Of OCPS programs announced Wednesday for the center, only a performance Oct. 6 
by Teatro de Danza Espanola can be said to fall outside the standard classical 
repertory. OCPS will be presenting ethnic programs at other venues. 
</P>
<P>
 But executive director Dean Corey said the ethnic programs were "not opposed 
by the center" this time. Rather, Corey said that because he took over his job 
in August, he got a late start on programming and found that performers and/or 
the center already were booked.  
</P>
<P>
 The upcoming season includes three ethnic concerts, one fewer than in OCPS' 
current season. This year's programs -- the Chieftains, Mariachi los Camperos 
de Nati Cano, Les Ballets Africains from the Republic of Guinea and the 
Hungarian State Folk Ensemble -- had been opposed as "non-classical" by 
now-departed center president Thomas R. Kendrick. 
</P>
<P>
 Kendrick ultimately was overruled by the center board, but the issue was left 
unresolved for future seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey said Wednesday that some aspects of the ethnic programming matter still 
have to be discussed by OCPS and center officials but that they do not involve 
programming philosophy so much as "defining a line of demarcation" between what 
the two organizations offer, basically the question of who presents what. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey added that his relationship with the new center management has gone 
smoothly.  
</P>
<P>
 Of the groups performing this year, only Mariachi los Camperos de Nati Cano 
will return to Orange County under OCPS' sponsorship next year -- to perform at 
UC Irvine. OCPS will present Le Ballet National du Senegal, a West African 
troupe, at the Irvine Barclay Theatre, and Teatro de Danza Espanola at the 
center.

TRIO APPROVES OF MATADOR'S MOVES; POP MUSIC: YO LA TENGO IS BENEFITING FROM ITS 
ASSOCIATION WITH THE LABEL, WHICH HAS TIES TO ATLANTIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Yo La Tengo, a trio fronted by a singing former rock critic and his drummer 
wife, has been kicking around rock's cult fringe for close to a decade, 
releasing its albums on an assortment of small, independent labels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hoboken, N.J.-based group's latest album, "Painful," is also on an 
"indie," but one with a difference. Matador Records began a high-profile 
affiliation with Atlantic Records a year ago, and Yo La Tengo is among those 
reaping the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Painful" has already become the group's best-selling record. The trio is on a 
high-profile tour as the opening act for Scottish power-pop favorites Teenage 
Fanclub, and even appeared on network television last week, performing on Conan 
O'Brien's late-night NBC program. (It plays a solo show Friday at the Casbah in 
San Diego and returns to open for Teenage Fanclub at the Palace in Hollywood on 
Saturday.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have changed some for us," says singer-guitarist Ira Kaplan. "I'm not 
too clear how much of it is Atlantic and how much of it is Matador and how much 
of it is just circumstances. . . . But we're pretty sure we wouldn't be going 
on the Conan O'Brien show if we weren't tied to Atlantic." 
</P>
<P>
 Such corporate patronage is probably the last thing that Kaplan and his wife, 
Georgia Hubley, expected when they began playing informally together. Starting 
with their "Ride the Tiger" album in 1986, they established themselves as 
quirky disciples of the Velvet Underground and the Kinks, crafting an evocative 
blend of dreamy, ambient folk and grinding feedback blowouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really tried not to have ambitions and expectations," says Kaplan, whose 
group is rounded out by bassist James McNew. "I think if we did we wouldn't be 
around today. If we had set any kind of timetable nine years ago, we would have 
missed it. We've really just tried to look at it as short term as we can for as 
long as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 They slowly built an audience and finally reached the self-supporting stage, 
and now the association with Matador is giving them an additional boost. 
They're part of an eclectic roster of some 20 acts -- from singer-songwriter 
Liz Phair to underground heroes Pavement -- whose impeccable credentials of 
coolness meet tantalizing commercial potential. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which has made the New York-based Matador the hippest indie since Sub 
Pop set the stage for Seattle's rock explosion in the late '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to Matador's emergence has been its innovative partnership with 
Atlantic Records. The record-industry giant owns half of Matador, which still 
operates as an independent -- manufacturing and distributing some of its 
product on its own and releasing some of its records through Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not followers of trends, they set trends," says Atlantic President 
Danny Goldberg, who "relentlessly" pursued the Matador deal in his bid to make 
Atlantic a force in alternative rock. "They're totally oblivious to what other 
people think is good. There's very few people with the talent or the courage to 
follow their own instincts that way." 
</P>
<P>
 For an artist like Yo La Tengo's Kaplan, that musical acumen counts for a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things I like best about them is that we trust their musical 
instincts," he says. "It's easier than usual to take their advice and not 
question their judgments. I think we see eye to eye with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Matador co-owner and co-manager Gerard Cosloy, who joined the company shortly 
after it was founded in 1988 by his longtime friend Chris Lombardi, downplays 
the label's role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always believed that if Yo La Tengo were given that equal footing and 
the same opportunity to be seen and checked out as the Lemonheads and Counting 
Crows or something like that, they would come out of it pretty well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not the artists, we're just a conduit. . . . People romanticize record 
labels far more than they ought to."

REAL LIFE PROVIDES COMICS RELIEF; COMEDY: THANKS TO THE MENENDEZ TRIAL, MICHAEL 
JACKSON, THE QUAKE, LORENA AND JOHN WAYNE BOBBITT AND TONYA HARDING, 'THE JOKES 
ARE WRITING THEMSELVES THESE DAYS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It may be a lousy time to be wealthy parents, abusive husbands, figure skaters 
or Angelenos in general, but it's a great time for comics, who have enjoyed an 
embarrassment of riches when it comes to topical fodder for jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jokes are writing themselves these days," says comedian Rick Overton, who 
recently performed at Comic Relief VI. 
</P>
<P>
 "An opportunity like this doesn't come along often, but it seems they're 
coming around a lot more lately," observes Kevin Ryder, part of KROQ-FM's 
morning team of Kevin and Bean. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great for the writers of 'The Tonight Show' and 'Letterman,' " says 
comic and actor Kevin Pollack. "This is what they live for. A slow news day 
affects them more than actual reporters -- that's when they sweat." 
</P>
<P>
 They haven't been sweating recently. Chief among humor topics nowadays is, of 
course, that recent morning in which the earth itself became a giant Magic 
Fingers jammed with enough quarters to turn beds from Ventura to Vegas into 
mechanical bulls. Michael Jackson, however, shot to No. 1 in the comedy hit 
parade when he spent millions to ensure that the adjective "alleged" would 
forever come before the phrase "child molester" in descriptions of him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya Harding, the American Gladiator of figure skaters, currently takes the 
bronze medal in the world of comedy -- unless she decides to take a whack at 
Jackson's knees. Two hung juries revived interest in the Sons-Who-Kill-Too-Much 
saga of Lyle and Erik Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 And the old war horse of topical gags -- the Battling Bickersons of the '90s, 
Lorena and John Wayne Bobbitt -- received a burst of renewed energy when a jury 
decided Lorena was a few sandwiches short of a picnic when she plunged an 
ordinary kitchen utensil into the annals of legal history. 
</P>
<P>
 All this has overshadowed otherwise fertile fields for jesting, such as Bobby 
Ray Inman's quixotic, very public bout of paranoia, Dan Quayle's appearance in 
a potatoe, er, potato chip commercial and the historic news that the remaining 
Beatles are reuniting. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you write everyday , periods like this are a lot more fun than those 
days when you pick up a paper and the choices are a tired 'Gore is still stiff' 
joke," says late-night host Arsenio Hall. "When Troy Aikman got his concussion 
or Prince Charles got attacked, I knew the mix had to be 'Tonya Harding's a 
Bills fan' or 'Now Tonya wants to be king.' These days, the jokes don't totally 
write themselves, but the news lately sure helps the work flow better." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the choicest bits include: 
</P>
<P>
 Of Jackson, Overton asks rhetorically, "How dysfunctional do you have to be to 
have LaToya think you've got problems?" Leno adds that since Jackson settled 
the suit to concentrate on his music, "next month he starts his 'Guiltier Than 
Hell' tour." 
</P>
<P>
 Leno began earthquake jokes the day after the temblor: "Welcome to Los 
Angeles: Some Assembly Required." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't even have money to fix the stuff that is broken," Leno added. "Like 
the freeway. You see what they are doing on the Santa Monica Freeway that caved 
in? They just put up a big sign that said, 'Dip.' ' 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin and Bean have created a Seismo-line, in which Olympic-style judges give 
Richter scale scores whenever an aftershock is felt. "The Czech judge will just 
give it a 3.7, and there'll be boos from the crowd," Ryder explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Overton says, "Now I'm walking around my house with a portable door frame on 
wheels." 
</P>
<P>
 Pollack points out that Universal Studios theme park temporarily closed its 
Earthquake attraction. " 'Out of respect,' they say. Out of respect. Why don't 
they tear the damn thing down out of respect? These are the same guys who'd go 
to the Midwest and build a Big Flood ride." 
</P>
<P>
 David Letterman, meanwhile, has blazed territory in the Harding case: "Because 
of the pressure that Atty. Gen. Janet Reno has been putting on the networks to 
cut down on the violence on TV, today CBS announced that they were dropping 
figure skating." Letterman also suggested Shannen Doherty play Harding in the 
made-for-TV movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Leno on the Menendez brothers: "Today, I got a speeding ticket. Actually, I 
got out of it. I told the cops I was rushing home to kill my parents. So they 
said, 'OK, go ahead.' " Leno also observed that the jurors at Erik Menendez's 
trial grew to like him, adding, "That would've made his parents so proud." 
</P>
<P>
 Pollack says, "After having to spend the holidays with my family, I can begin 
to relate to the Menendez brothers. I'm sitting there thinking, I could take my 
mom out easily, but to get my dad I'll probably have to reload -- he's still 
pretty quick." 
</P>
<P>
 And anyone who sat through Comic Relief VI can only salute Pollack when he 
says, "I'm staying away from Bobbitt jokes. There are too many (penis) jokes 
around in the first place."

WHAT'S BEHIND LATINO EXODUS AT KNBC NEWS?; TELEVISION: FIVE MEMBERS OF THE 
STAFF HAVE LEFT IN FIVE MONTHS, SOME CITING BIAS. CHANNEL 4 NEWS DIRECTOR MARK 
HOFFMAN IS ACCUSED OF GIVING WHITE MALES CHOICE ASSIGNMENTS, BUT MANAGEMENT 
DENIES THE CHARGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 KNBC-TV Channel 4 is under fire from Latino journalists who charge that 
discrimination by management played a key role in the exit of five Latino 
reporters and anchors in less than five months. 
</P>
<P>
 Current and former newsroom staffers said that Latino journalists have been 
consistently treated with disrespect and pushed into the background since Mark 
Hoffman took over as news director last March, while white male reporters 
received preferential treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am resigning due to the continual oppressive discriminatory treatment I am 
experiencing in the Channel 4 newsroom," reporter Rebecca A. Aguilar wrote in 
her resignation letter Nov. 8 to President and General Manager Reed Manville. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar and others said that, under Hoffman, white male reporters have gotten 
the best stories, better work schedules and more career incentives, while 
Latino journalists largely have been relegated to less important stories and 
assigned mostly to morning and weekend shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those who have departed said the atmosphere at the station became so 
oppressive that they felt compelled to leave even though they did not have 
another job lined up or would have to take a cut in pay. Their sentiments were 
echoed by several other KNBC employees who spoke on the condition that their 
names not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Manville vehemently denied the charges. He said KNBC is well above Federal 
Communications Commission guidelines in the number of Latinos employed at the 
station and added that the news division has recently hired four Latinos in 
front of and behind the camera. Without going into specifics, he said the 
reasons for the departures of the five Latinos stemmed from personal or 
professional considerations that had nothing to do with mistreatment or 
prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We categorically deny that there is any discrimination at the station," 
Manville said. "We are committed to diversity in our news force." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But veteran anchor Carla Aragon, who left KNBC Jan. 21 following prolonged 
contract negotiations, maintained that management is to blame for the 
conditions that led to the exits. 
</P>
<P>
 "KNBC may claim it has not discriminated against Latinos, but something has to 
be wrong," Aragon said. "Why would five Latino reporters leave in the last five 
months if conditions at KNBC were so good -- especially three veteran reporters 
who have been in the L.A. market for a total of almost three decades?" 
</P>
<P>
 She added, "I hope that, by my departure, the station's awareness level can be 
raised." 
</P>
<P>
 Aragon's departure was the fifth among the eight Latino reporters and anchors 
who were at the station when Hoffman took over as news director. Besides her 
and Aguilar, those leaving KNBC since August are veteran reporter David Garcia, 
now working at KTTV-TV Channel 11; anchor Linda Alvarez, now an anchor at 
KCBS-TV Channel 2, and Dan Rascon, a reporter in the minority training program 
who was let go at the end of his internship. (The remaining three Latino 
reporters either declined to be quoted about the atmosphere at KNBC or couldn't 
be reached.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the same period, the only white journalist to leave KNBC was anchor John 
Beard, who departed in December to take an anchor position at KTTV. He cited 
dissatisfaction with the news judgment of his bosses, which he said centered on 
tabloid journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman, a TV news director in Chicago and Atlanta before joining NBC-owned 
Channel 4 here, deferred comment on the controversy to Manville. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Hispanic Media Coalition, a watchdog organization that monitors 
the employment of Latinos in radio, television and film, last month filed an 
"informal objection" with the Federal Communications Commission against the 
renewal of KNBC's license, saying that the grievances and departures of the 
Latinos demonstrates that the station has not lived up to its assurances to 
give Latinos an equal opportunity to be hired and promoted. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Chicano News Media Assn. said it is planning an inquiry into 
the departures. 
</P>
<P>
 KNBC's Latino journalists held meetings with Hoffman last September and 
October to voice their grievances. Although some acknowledged that conditions 
improved somewhat after the sessions, most indicated that "a negative 
atmosphere" continues to exist at the station. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to be where I am now, where I am respected as a journalist and 
trusted to use my expertise as a journalist and a member of the L.A. 
community," said Alvarez, who now anchors the morning and noon newscasts at 
KCBS. "I don't feel that was happening for me and for many other people at 
Channel 4." 
</P>
<P>
 Rascon, who now works as a general assignment reporter at a TV station in 
Denver, said he felt preferential treatment was given to a selected group of 
white males. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hispanics were discriminated against in the sense that we were not given 
lead stories," he said. "The same people day in and day out got those stories." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he was not given enough feedback and training during his 
internship at the station. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I was not given a fair shot," Rascon said. "I came in with the 
understanding that I was not qualified for KNBC, and they agreed to bring me in 
and train me. But only once did anyone look at my work and critique me." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman and Manville declined to speak specifically about the individual 
reporters and anchors who have left. But management sources said they believe 
that Alvarez and Garcia departed because they received more attractive offers 
from competing stations, that Aguilar was disgruntled about Hoffman's 
aggressive methods in trying to improve the news operation, and that Rascon's 
work was not up to KNBC standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia declined to comment, but Aguilar, who quit several months before her 
contract expired, said of this explanation, "I was not disgruntled; I was 
unhappy. I gave up a big salary and I didn't have a job. I was tired of 
fighting the negative energy and injustices." She now works for a station in 
Dallas as a general assignment reporter and said she is making $15,000 a year 
less than she did at KNBC. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As for Aragon, the KNBC management sources said they were surprised at her 
decision to leave because, after extended discussions, executives had met her 
demand to co-anchor the 4 p.m. news and to boost her salary from $180,000 a 
year to $300,000. They concluded that she left because she was seeking a "life 
change" and wanted to rejoin her family in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 But Aragon, a 10 1/2-year veteran at Channel 4, said, "My negotiations with 
KNBC were unsatisfactory. The station did not meet my personal deadline or my 
personal expectations. Station management dragged its feet and made me jump 
through hoops. It was not until I gave notice that the station finally made a 
fair offer. But by then it was too late." 
</P>
<P>
 She continued, "It's very difficult to leave a place that has become home, 
where there are many friends and many people who I respect as journalists. That 
is the biggest loss. I would have stayed if the conditions had been better, and 
if they had presented their offer two weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I would rather go to a smaller market and make less money, but work at a 
station that values my commitment to the community and treats employees with 
respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Countering the accusations by Aragon and others, KNBC's Manville pointed out 
that Latinos have been hired in recent weeks in prominent positions, including 
general assignment reporter Jim Avila; "Today in L.A." morning anchor Kathy 
Vara; former Assistant U.S. Atty. Manuel Medrano, who will become the station's 
legal affairs reporter, and News Manager Fernando Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a competitive market, and we're building a new team," Manville said. 
"In building a team, you're often presented with opportunity -- some by choice, 
some by default. We look upon every opportunity to attract the best and 
brightest journalists we can find without any regard to their race or ethnic 
background."

JUST FOLKS, FOR A CHANGE; LATINOS ON CBS' 'SECOND CHANCES' WELCOME THEIR 
PORTRAYAL 
</P>

 There are four Latinos on a single TV series and not one of them is a 
criminal. 
</P>
<P>
 It shouldn't be news. But in the world of prime-time television, it is -- as 
the producers of CBS' "Second Chances" ruefully learned in casting for their 
tight-knit, attractive, middle-class Latino family. 
</P>
<P>
 "It surprised me how emotional our auditioning process became because so many 
of the actors said they never have a chance to play non-criminals, non-pimps or 
pushers or gang members," said Bernard Lechowick, who along with his wife, Lynn 
Marie Latham, created and produces the nighttime soap opera that premiered in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 "We continue to get these heartfelt testimonials about how they appreciate 
someone presenting a family that reflects their actual families," he said. 
"Someone treating their culture with respect. To me it's kind of sad in a way, 
and I don't know when it will come, but I really look forward to the day when 
it won't be news that there is a Mexican American family on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepe Serna, who landed the role of the widowed father trying to do right by 
his job while keeping a stern eye on his three children, said he's done 40 
feature films, 40 television movies and about 100 guest shots on TV series, 
"and this is by far the best, most positive part I've ever gotten. It's the 
best thing I've seen in showing a Mexican American family that is strong, 
caring, intelligent and proud of their culture. Television always tends to 
exploit, and it has always exploited Latinos in the worst light." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Latham and Lechowick, two white producers who added a black family during 
their six-year stint on "Knots Landing" and also included a black family in 
their most recent drama, last season's "Homefront," said their primary concern 
is good drama, not breaking new ground. Since "Second Chances" is set in 
Southern California, reality and good storytelling dictated that Latinos play a 
part. (Because of severe earthquake damage to its set in Valencia, the show has 
shut down production indefinitely. CBS says it is expected to return in several 
months.) 
</P>
<P>
 The producers say that the key is to write the characters as real people 
rather than as representatives of an ethnic group, and the truth, Latham noted, 
is that a huge number of Latinos in this country live in middle-class families, 
struggling with the same financial and personal difficulties as most white 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the show takes time to let the characters be uniquely Mexican American. 
Serna's character, a Vietnam vet and fifth-generation Californian, keeps a flag 
of Mexico in his office and desperately wants his 22-year-old daughter, played 
by Jennifer Lopez, to marry within her race. His two sons (portrayed by John 
Chaidez and Daniel Gonzalez) play soccer. Both he and his daughter use phrases 
of Spanish when they argue. 
</P>
<P>
 Lechowick, who has produced two bilingual series for PBS, writes the 
occasional line of Spanish dialogue and checks with Serna and other friends to 
make sure the syntax and other cultural details are correct. Serna, a native of 
Corpus Christi, Tex., said he sometimes asks to add some Spanish slang here or 
there "to educate the viewers and make them see that they don't have to be 
afraid of Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
 Since so few Latino characters exist on network television today -- one of the 
minor regulars on "NYPD Blue" is Puerto Rican and one of the white characters 
on "Beverly Hills, 90210" is dating a Latino -- Lechowick acknowledged that he 
feels an increased responsibility to portray his Mexican American characters 
positively. The Serna and Lopez characters are fiercely intelligent, honest and 
absolutely true to their own moral code. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, many of the white characters -- and the show does spend a great 
deal of its time chronicling the love triangles and a convoluted murder 
investigation that primarily involves the many white residents of the fictional 
Santa Rita -- are laden with foibles.  
</P>
<P>
 "We look forward to the day when we can cast a villain or a saint without 
having to be sensitive to that kind of thing," Lechowick said. "But I think we 
also have to be responsible to creating real characters, and I do think these 
people have flaws. The father is sometimes way out of line and overbearing and 
is even vulnerable to the charge of being a racist for his wanting his daughter 
to marry a Mexican." 
</P>
<P>
 Serna, however, doesn't see anything wrong with presenting overwhelmingly 
strong, intelligent Latinos as a counterbalance to all the negative images that 
predominate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's a completely 'Father Knows Best' kind of thing because 
they do show the foibles of this family," Serna said. "But if it comes off as a 
little Pollyanna, that's OK. We need that not only for the Latino youth, but 
for all the young people in this country. To show young Latinos that the 
possibilities are there for anything you can dream of. I love that I'm playing 
a positive guy." 
</P>
<P>
 And he said, the Latinos who have seen it love it too. Serna said that leaders 
of Latino organizations have called to thank him, saying it is "exactly what we 
need. One woman told me that ours was the first show that her husband actually 
watched and did not click around. Latino professionals from around the country 
call me and they think I'm a genius for writing all this brilliant stuff, for 
finally getting us up there on the screen. And the kids too watch this with 
some pride that it's not about cholos getting busted by the cops. That the kids 
are just American boys with the same problems as other kids -- getting their 
homework done." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, who was born to Puerto Rican parents in New York, also said that she 
has received excited letters from Latinos encouraging her to continue 
"representing the Latin world in such a wonderful way." She believes, 
especially in light of the current anger and resentment over the issue of 
Latino immigration, that the show can play a role in defusing prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thrilled to be a part of something so important because this is the first 
time that I know of where a Latino family has been portrayed so nicely, as just 
a regular family with ups and downs," she said. "Hopefully, people will look at 
it, and it will open their eyes to see that we are all so much alike. Yes, we 
are rich in culture and tradition, but we're all just regular people. We're not 
all gang bangers and drug dealers. There's this whole middle class all over the 
United States that works hard, and the show in its way even says that if you're 
lucky, someone in your family could even fall in love with us."

A BIGGER SEASON AHEAD FOR OCPS; MUSIC: THE PHILHARMONIC SOCIETY WILL OFFER SIX 
MORE EVENTS AND TWO MORE SERIES IN '94-'95 THAN IT DID IN '93-'94, INCLUDING A 
WIDER RANGE OF CLASSICAL WORKS. 
</P>

<P>
 The Orange County Philharmonic Society is in expansion mode for next season 
after reducing its offerings in 1993-94 because of budget and scheduling 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, there are eight orchestra concerts at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, five other events at the center by 
diverse groups, and six programs being presented jointly with the Laguna 
Chamber Music Society at the Irvine Barclay Theatre. Next season again will see 
eight orchestra concerts at the center but only three additional programs there 
by diverse groups. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there will be 13 concerts at the Irvine Barclay, and a Mexican 
Christmas program at the UC Irvine Bren Center on a date to be announced. Dean 
Corey, announcing his first season since taking over as OCPS executive director 
in August, has added two new series at the IBT, one of programs by the Los 
Angeles Chamber Orchestra and another of programs by chamber ensembles. 
Altogether there will be 25 events, as opposed to the 19 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's not just be a matter of quantity. The programs next season will span 
a wider range of classical music, from the medieval to the contemporary. The 
Irvine Barclay will see not just chamber groups but other types of programs 
including dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Anonymous 4, a group of four women, will sing medieval chants and polyphony at 
the Barclay on Feb. 6. The Kronos Quartet will be there May 11. And the 
minimalist music of John Adams and Philip Glass will be played there by the 
London Chamber Orchestra on Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 One can be sure that when Peter Maxwell Davies leads the BBC Orchestra of 
Manchester at OCPAC on March 20, he will conduct some of his own bracing and 
abrasive music. And Esa-Pekka Salonen will conduct the Los Angeles Philharmonic 
in his own "Mimo II" for oboe and orchestra at the center on April 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional international orchestras will include the Kirov Orchestra of St. 
Petersburg (Oct. 10), the Franz Liszt Chamber Orchestra of Budapest (Nov. 12) 
and the Vienna Symphony (Nov. 14). The United States will be further 
represented by the Utah Symphony (Feb. 13) and the Orchestra of St. Luke's, 
conducted by Andre Previn (April 11). 
</P>
<P>
 Missing from the Society's schedule at the center will be all but one of the 
ethnic and world music and dance programs that sparked a controversy last 
season (see accompanying story). 
</P>
<P>
 Teatro de Danza Espanola will open the OCPS season at the center on Oct. 6. 
Two other ethnic groups -- the Mariachi los Camperos de Nati Cano and the 
National Ballet du Senegal -- will perform in Irvine, at the Bren Center and 
the IBT respectively. O.C. Philharmonic Society's '94-95 Concert Season AT THE

POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: FLUF LIKES THE PRICE OF SMALL LABEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Otis Barthoulameu is as big and round as the name by which everybody knows 
him: 'O.' 
</P>
<P>
 He fronts Fluf, a trio whose combination of hard-riffing clout, classy and 
diverse influences, punk-rooted authenticity and frequent pop accessibility 
would attract the interest of major labels, no matter where the band was based. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Fluf is part of the San Diego rock scene that last year emerged 
as a much-publicized incubator of alternative-rock talent, a potential Seattle 
South, has ensured big-label interest. 
</P>
<P>
 But any major label courting Fluf may find O too set in his roundness, 
figuratively speaking, to conform to the squared-off peg-holes of rock's 
corporate sphere. 
</P>
<P>
 When a major label signs an act, it can legitimately expect some cooperation 
in its promotional efforts, one big part of which is splashing that act's 
picture across the pages of newspapers and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 O hates having his picture taken, unless it is done while Fluf is on stage 
performing. 
</P>
<P>
 When Fluf's label, Cargo/Headhunter, sent out promotional copies of its 1993 
debut album, "Mangravy," they were accompanied by an official band portrait 
shot that showed three young men, none of whom happened to be in Fluf. And a 
recent photo session at The Times turned into a touchy game of hide-and-seek 
between O and the camera lens. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just standard. It's the thing everybody's expected to do," O says of the 
tradition of rocker as reluctant camera subject. To him, that is reason enough 
not to pose.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not puppets. Come take pictures of us (on stage)," said O, who makes 
his living as an action photographer for a skateboarding and snowboarding 
publication. "Live, we're doing what we do." 
</P>
<P>
 O and his band-mates, bassist Jonny Donhowe and drummer Miles Gillett, won't 
play in places that set age restrictions, which could cause some stickiness 
should a label insist that certain bar gigs would be good career moves (Fluf 
makes one exception to that rule, playing at the Casbah in San Diego out of 
respect for the bar's contributions as an important nurturer of the city's 
alternative-rock scene). 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids are important. Why should they be left out of the scene?" asked O, who 
will front Fluf in an all-ages show Friday at Our House in Costa Mesa. The 
band's first national tour, a three-week cross-country trip in April, is geared 
to all-ages venues. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluf's members have other ideas that the big leagues would probably balk at, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, these partisans of the endangered LP make a point of putting 
extra songs on the vinyl versions of their albums, the exact opposite of what's 
dictated by the music industry's wildly successful campaign to blanket 
turntables in dust. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Fluf's second album, due out Feb. 21 on the San Diego-based 
Cargo/Headhunter label, has not one name, but three, with the title varying 
according to which format the consumer buys. The CD is called "Home 
Improvements" and will come with a 16-page booklet of pictures showing O's idea 
of a well-appointed abode. The LP is called "Whitey on the Moon," after a 
memorable satiric poem by the jazz-R&B innovator, Gil Scott-Heron. And the 
cassette is called "Stocking the Lake With Brown Trout," for reasons best left 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one's ever done it before. Why be stale?" O said of Fluf's flexible 
approach to naming things. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For all the above reasons, O says, Fluf is an unlikely major label prospect, 
even if its members are willing to enjoy the largess of big-label scouts who 
lately have courted them with expense account meals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think major labels are overall stupid and lame," O said during a recent 
interview over a newspaper's version of an expense-accounted meal. The fare was 
modest contrasted with what O, Donhowe and Gillett say they have been getting 
from record companies. Here at a Fountain Valley salad bar, the band members 
were not likely to see Sylvester Stallone walk by covered in fake blood, as 
they did during a recent Fluf lunch at the Warner Bros. commissary in Burbank. 
Stallone was surprisingly short, recalls Donhowe, while the food spread was 
incredibly large. 
</P>
<P>
 Leery of being signed simply because it hails from one of the hot local scenes 
of the moment, Fluf is looking for a commitment that goes beyond big-label 
money and prestige. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would have to top what Headhunter does for us, which is a lot," O said 
of the prospect of accepting a major label deal. Headhunter's managers "care 
about what we do. They don't just think about us as the next big thing. I can 
walk right into the office and talk to the head guy if I have a problem. On a 
major label, you're just a little guy." 
</P>
<P>
 This insistence on the personal touch and authentic interactions in the 
business sphere has its parallel in O's songs.  
</P>
<P>
 Friendship and betrayal are two of his biggest themes. Friends who keep faith 
are the heroes of such poignant songs as "Peanut Butter," from Mangravy, and 
the new "Mark Andrea," which honors the former Don't Mean Maybe guitarist who, 
to O's regret, dropped out of the local scene a few years ago in favor of a 
life focused on marriage and career. 
</P>
<P>
 "That song has to do with Mark, but it's about everybody," O said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, O seems to be friendly with just about everybody on the local rock 
scene. Whether in San Diego, where he lives now, or in Orange County, where he 
spent his high school years and much of his childhood, he is one of the people 
you're most likely to run into at a grass-roots rock show -- sort of a bulky, 
gruffly amiable, extremely self-willed version of Woody Allen's ubiquitous 
Zelig. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gillett, who spent the '80s playing drums in El Grupo Sexo and Gherkin 
Raucous, two of Orange County's leading alternative bands of the decade, said 
it was easy to underestimate O in those days. O was a guy who helped bands out 
as a roadie and supported them as a buddy and a fan. He wasn't, it seemed, 
destined to be a shaper of the music. Once, O asked Gillett to join him in a 
band that would take its core inspiration from Tom Waits, whom they both 
admire. Gillett gave him the brushoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never played because I never took him seriously," Gillett recalled. "He 
was just happy-go-lucky O, and you'd bump into him everywhere. I never thought 
of him as a serious-minded musician." 
</P>
<P>
 That changed one day in 1990 when Gillett was hanging out at the KUCI studio 
in Irvine. Olivelawn, a new band that included O on guitar and Donhowe playing 
bass, was performing live in the studio. Donhowe, 26, recalls that Gillett 
occupied himself by barraging Olivelawn with strawberries as it tried to play: 
"He must have hit me 20 times, stained my bass, my clothes, the wall. He got 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gillett kept his ears open while he fired, and what he heard impressed 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shook me up a bit," he said. "I told O, 'If Eddie (Glass, the Olivelawn 
drummer) ever gets hit by a train, call me." 
</P>
<P>
 It would have to be a long-distance call, because Gillett was flying to New 
Zealand the next day, moving back to where he had spent his early childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted by the distance, O did call and write. And, as he conceived of 
starting Fluf as a vehicle for his own singing and songwriting, he began trying 
to pry Gillett loose from his reclaimed roots. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Gillett came back for a monthlong visit. He jammed with O and 
Donhowe, and they all saw that the music clicked. A second visit that year 
lasted two months, long enough to record "Mangravy," which was released early 
in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to come back here," said Gillett, 30, who lives now in Irvine. 
"My preference for everyday living is New Zealand; I love it there. To be 
honest, the only reason I'm back is this band." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like Southern California, either," chimed in O, who is 31. "When he 
goes back, I'm going with him. We made a pact that we'll be out of here by 
1999." 
</P>
<P>
 Fluf's members reserve particular scorn for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Hecho del Diablo," from Mangravy, was a jab at the city where 
music-as-business has its hub. 
</P>
<P>
 For O, L.A. represents the impersonal forces that stand against sincerity and 
comradeship, the virtues he most extols in his songs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody really cares about anybody in L.A.," he said. "Everybody's geared up 
to movie stars: 'I saw so-and-so in this bar and got to talk to them.' It's so 
lame, so false. The theme for L.A. is 'everybody look out for No. 1, I'm more 
important than everybody else.' They've got to change that." 
</P>
<P>
 What O and Donhowe most relish about the San Diego scene is the camaraderie 
and mutual support they see among the city's alternative-rock bands. It's 
something that O says is missing in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that bums me out about Orange County is all these bands are 
thinking about moving to L.A. and getting on a major label," he said. "It seems 
their measure of success is different from the San Diego measure. (They think) 
if you're not on a major label, you're not a success story. I think it's the 
other way around. It's about making records, not signing deals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only ambition is to do things the way I want," O concluded, adding that 
he got into rock music because he wanted to let people know how he felt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be a rock star. Frank Zappa did everything his way. I'm 
taking up where he left off." 
</P>
<P>
 * Fluf, Cold Water Crane and Doo Rag play at 9 p.m. Friday at Our House, 720 
W. 19th St., Costa Mesa. $3 (all ages admitted). (714) 650-8960.

DEFROSTING A BARGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEV BENNETT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In our household, the freezer compartment of our refrigerator is the 
equivalent to the legendary hall closet of radio's Fibber McGee: You open it 
and run fast before you're bonked on the head by flying, foil-wrapped food.  
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that I can't pass up a food bargain, especially two-for-one 
sales on meat. Like Noah, I start with two of everything: two chickens for the 
price of one; two pounds of ground beef; two club steaks, two pork chops -- and 
hope the freezer will hold them all. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory this works well. I cook one-half of my bargain immediately and 
freeze the remainder for a second meal. The payoff would be to have an almost 
free dinner; the trick is to find the second half. All too often I add to, 
rather than eat, the inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a recent effort to make more freezer space, I foraged through the foil 
packages and struck gold: two packages, each with two small pork chops (I must 
have gone back for seconds on that sale). 
</P>

 I prepared the pork with buttery yellow potatoes, garlic and meaty Portobello 
mushrooms, flavored it with rosemary and simmered it in red wine, beef broth 
and a little balsamic vinegar. It was one of my great freezer finds. PORK CHOPS

small (1-inch-thick) rib pork chops 1/2 pound thinly sliced yellow Finn or 
Yukon Gold potatoes 1 garlic clove, smashed 1/2 pound Portobello mushrooms, 
sliced 1/2-inch thick 1/2 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary 1/4 cup dry red wine 1 
cup beef broth 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar 
</P>
<P>

Reserve fat. 
</P>
<P>
 Place flour in plastic food bag with salt and pepper to taste. Add pork chops 
and shake to coat with flour. Reserve any remaining flour. 
</P>
<P>
 If bacon fat has cooled, reheat in skillet. Add pork chops in single layer and 
brown on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove chops from pan. Add 
potatoes and garlic and saute potatoes 2 minutes per side. Add mushrooms and 
rosemary and saute 2 to 3 minutes longer. Add any reserved flour to skillet and 
stir well.

 When I was growing up, sausage, peppers and eggs -- all fried together -- was 
a favorite Sunday after-church meal. We never called it brunch. Maybe it was 
before the word was invented. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweet sausage meat, lean and flecked with fennel seeds, was first removed 
from the casings and then fried in olive oil. The peppers -- the long, 
pale-green variety -- were added and fried until tender and lightly browned. To 
finish the dish, a bowl of eggs that had been beaten to a froth was stirred 
into the mixture. When the eggs were soft-scrambled, the dish was spooned onto 
a platter and served with thick slices of toasted Italian bread. 
</P>
<P>
 I seem to remember the preparation and cooking as vividly as I recall the 
actual eating. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of us had our own way of devouring this favorite dish. My sister liked it 
sprinkled with grated cheese, usually Pecorino Romano. My dad spooned his 
serving onto the toasted bread, which looked like he was eating an open-faced 
hero sandwich. I just ate my serving, plain and simple, by the fork-full. 
SAUSAGE, PEPPERS AND SCRAMBLED EGGS 1 pound sweet Italian sausages with fennel, 
removed from casings, crumbled 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 pound 
long, sweet, green Italian frying peppers, halved lengthwise, seeded and 
stemmed 1 garlic clove, crushed 8 large eggs, whisked until frothy 1/2 teaspoon 
salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or 
Pecorino Romano cheese 
</P>
<P>
 Crumble sausage into large, preferably non-stick skillet. Cook over medium 
heat, stirring, until sausage loses pink color, about 10 minutes. Drain off 
excess fat. 
</P>
<P>
 Add olive oil and sweet peppers. Stir to coat. Cover and cook 5 minutes or 
until peppers are tender. Uncover and cook over medium-high heat, stirring, 
until sweet peppers and sausage begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic 
and cook 1 minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Turn heat to high. Season eggs to taste with salt and pepper. Slowly stir 
beaten eggs into sausage mixture. Cook, turning eggs with large wooden spoon or 
plastic spatula so they cook evenly, about 3 minutes. Transfer to platter. 
Season to taste with cheese. Serve at once. Makes 4 servings. OVEN-ROASTED 
POTATOES 2 pounds small boiling potatoes, scrubbed and halved, or quartered if 
large 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary leaves, 
optional Salt Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Place potatoes in 13x9-inch baking pan. Drizzle with oil and sprinkle with 
rosemary, salt and pepper to taste. Toss to coat. 
</P>
<P>
 Roast at 400 degrees, turning carefully with spatula as they brown, about 40 
minutes, or until browned and tender. Makes 4 servings. CHERRY TOMATO AND 
ITALIAN PARSLEY SALAD 1 basket cherry tomatoes, rinsed, stemmed 1/2 bunch 
parsley leaves, coarsely chopped 1 stalk celery, thinly sliced 1 garlic clove, 
crushed 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil Salt 
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Halve tomatoes and place in serving bowl. Add parsley, celery, garlic, lemon 
juice, olive oil and salt and pepper to taste. Toss salad. Let stand at room 
temperature until ready to serve. Makes 4 servings.
