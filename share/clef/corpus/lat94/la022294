AL MARTINEZ: AN OLD DOG IN THE RAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We had an old dog named Hoover who broke out of his yard during that rainstorm 
the other day, and we haven't seen him since. I'm afraid he's gone forever. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unlike him not to be around somewhere. Even when he managed to dig out 
under the fence, which he had done since he was a puppy, he never went far, 
especially in the rain. It terrified him. 
</P>
<P>
 I say he's probably gone forever because Hoover was about 18 years old and 
wobbly on his feet. He also couldn't hear well, and that made him vulnerable to 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 We live in coyote country and I suspect he came face to face with a pack of 
predators and just couldn't stand up to the onslaught. That's one reason we 
kept him in the yard. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know, of course, that he met that kind of fate. I like to think he 
just trotted off in the storm, looking for trouble, and disappeared over a far 
horizon, the way old dogs sometimes do. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't the kind of animal someone would kidnap for ransom. To begin with, 
he was just an old mutt and uglier than a manatee. Hoover was a drab brown, had 
an extraordinarily long snout and an expression that managed to be both sad and 
defiant. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, his behavior was less than exemplary. He was hell on cats, maiming one 
so badly it cost me $800 to have her patched up, and he was always less than 
totally housebroken. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll say this for him, though. He never messed in my workroom, although he did 
elsewhere in the house. We had a kind of tacit agreement. I didn't dig up his 
bones and he didn't urinate on my rug. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover was not a very important old dog. He wasn't a watchdog, that's for 
sure. We got him as a puppy and tried to train him to ward off intruders, but 
the most he'd do would be to stand in front of the refrigerator and bark at the 
ice maker. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the hell kind of protection is that?" I'd demand of my wife Cinelli, who 
loved that old dog dearly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't get him for protection," she'd say. "I got you for protection. I got 
him for company. He's a better listener, and he doesn't drink martinis." 
</P>
<P>
 But at least I don't pace in circles. Hoover paced endlessly in his old age, 
wandering clockwise around our central fireplace, through the dining room and 
then into the living room. Then he'd do it all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd go crazy listening to his toenails clicking on the tile floor while I was 
trying to watch "Mad About You," and after about his 40th time through the room 
I'd holler at him to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 He'd freeze in his tracks for a moment, then turn slowly and go the other way, 
pacing in circles counterclockwise, his toenails making that clickety-click 
sound on the tile, glaring at me as he'd pass. You had to hand it to the old 
mutt. He had spunk. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose that's why he loved freedom so, because you can't enclose a defiant 
free spirit. Not that his yard was small. We had it built especially for him 
and it was almost the size of our home, with a large doghouse to keep him out 
of the wind, which he also feared. 
</P>
<P>
 But he kept digging his way out, and after awhile would show up at the back 
door, almost gloating, knowing I'd have to go out and find his escape route and 
close it up again. Damned dog. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We called Animal Control when he didn't return, and then I went out looking 
for him. Two old dogs in the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Be sure to come back," Cinelli said to me when I left, as though I might 
wander off too, trotting toward the distance, where storms are born. 
</P>
<P>
 I walked up through the hills and then down a lot of streets asking if anyone 
had seen a dog that looked a lot like a manatee and limped a little when he 
walked. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed everyone was busy loading sandbags or shoveling mud or patching 
quake-damaged roofs, but they still took the time to listen to me. Dogs are 
important in Topanga. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd say, "He was just an old dog on his last legs and not much good to anyone. 
He was afraid of everything, even the moon, and sometimes when it was full, 
he'd cower in a corner of the house and bark at the ceiling." 
</P>
<P>
 But no one had seen Hoover and I finally gave up. We have accepted that he's 
gone and won't come back, and I miss him. I wasn't the best dog master in the 
world, but there was a kind of character to Hoover that age defined with 
compassion, and I came to understand his defiance. He was an old man raging 
against the dying of the light. 
</P>
<P>
 Death is a walk we take alone, and Hoover chose to take it in the teeth of a 
storm, despite his misgivings about rain. He's one with the weather now, but 
I'll think of him when the dark clouds gather over the mountains and a hard 
wind blows.

MIDDLE CLASS NEEDS HELP, TOO; BERMAN'S DISASTER DEDUCTIBILITY PROPOSAL IS WORTH 
A GOOD, LONG LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Are your out-of-pocket expenses for earthquake repairs running into thousands 
of dollars? Tallying up those expenses is even more depressing considering that 
under current tax law, deductions for unreimbursed casualty losses are very 
limited. Should losses stemming from unusual special circumstances such as the 
Northridge earthquake and other federally declared national disasters be 100% 
deductible? It's an idea worth exploring.  
</P>
<P>
 Current law allows taxpayers to deduct only a portion of unreimbursed casualty 
losses. Only losses exceeding 10% of adjusted gross income plus $100 can be 
deducted on federal income taxes. For example, if your adjusted gross income is 
$50,000, the 10% threshold is $5,000. If you incurred earthquake damage 
totaling $10,000 (after subtracting insurance and other reimbursements), only 
$5,000 can be deducted -- and you're still more than $5,000 in the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) has introduced legislation to 
eliminate that 10% threshold for victims of declared national disasters such as 
earthquakes, freezes or floods. The legislation, which is drawing bipartisan 
support from California members of the U.S. House, would be applicable to 
losses on declared disasters occurring on or after last Jan. 17, the day of the 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an amending of the Internal Revenue Code to apply to very specific 
emergency situations would provide some relief to middle-class families. These 
families' losses are straining household ledgers, but they are either 
ineligible or did not suffer enough damage to qualify for assistance from the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency, grants from the Housing and Urban 
Development Department and other loan and federal relief programs. 
</P>
<P>
 What would this change cost? Berman has submitted his bill to the Joint Tax 
Committee to assess the dollar impact. That finding should be available soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely the tax break would be tolerable and infrequently applied, though it 
may not seem so lately with the string of natural disasters across the nation 
such as earthquakes and floods. But families hit by such disasters take a 
disproportionate hit on their household budgets from which it may take years to 
recover. Providing some tax relief would lessen a blow that could otherwise 
prove crippling. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency situations require special responses. The middle class, although 
usually fortunate enough to have the resources to rebuild, needs help too.

3 STRIKES AND YOU'RE WHERE? AND NOW FEDERAL PROPOSALS; GET VIOLENT CRIMINALS 
OFF THE STREET? YOU BET, BUT HOW BEST TO DO IT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Three strikes and you're out" is political shorthand for legislation born out 
of enormous anger and fear about violent crime in America. Such sentencing 
proposals, under consideration in Congress and roughly 30 states, are intended 
to imprison three-time felons for life. The problems associated with "three 
strikes" legislation are present in the federal versions as well as in the many 
pending state proposals that we discussed in two recent editorials. The impulse 
behind the bills -- to get criminals off the street and behind bars for as long 
as possible -- must be carefully targeted if it is not to trigger the famous 
Law of Unintended Consequences, the recurring phenomenon that so often plagues 
public policy in America. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal versions, authored by Sens. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) and Trent Lott 
(R-Miss.), take the form of two amendments to the $22.3- billion federal crime 
bill that the Senate passed in November. They would impose mandatory life 
sentences for individuals convicted of a third "federal crime of violence" 
(under varying definitions) or those who received two prior state convictions 
for committing a violent crime. The law also would apply in cases of a third 
conviction for a major drug trafficking offense or selling drugs to minors, 
crimes that are not necessarily violent. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of various "three strikes" proposals include no less than President 
Clinton, who virtually endorsed the idea in his State of the Union message last 
month; other backers are California Gov. Pete Wilson and New York Gov. Mario 
Cuomo. However, Clinton now is expressing second thoughts about the federal 
legislation. He has good reason to do so -- and he should be applauded for 
airing his reservations despite the current anti-crime stampede. 
</P>
<P>
 With crime the top concern for many Americans -- 43%, according to a recent 
Los Angeles Times poll -- no politician wants to be seen as soft on 
lawbreakers. But far too few federal legislators are thinking realistically 
about how a "three strikes" policy actually would work or are questioning the 
underlying assumptions of the Gramm and Lott amendments. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Would "three strikes" laws deter crime? Politicians pass tough criminal 
sentencing laws, whether federal or state, because they believe that such laws 
have a strong deterrent effect on crime. But the evidence for this is not 
convincing. Despite increasingly harsh and inflexible prison sentences in 
recent decades, particularly for drug offenses, the national crime rate has 
rocketed by 371% since 1960 -- increasing nine times faster than the 
population. These tough sentencing laws may well have prevented an even greater 
rise in crime, but as in the case of past sentencing reforms their deterrent 
effect is anything but obvious.  
</P>
<P>
 2. Which three-time felons should be incarcerated for life?  
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in the mid-1980s and as part of its high-profile war on drugs, 
Congress imposed harsh mandatory minimum sentences for a wide variety of drug 
crimes, including those involving first-time offenders and those convicted on 
charges of nonviolent sale or possession of drugs. In so doing, Congress 
severely eroded judicial discretion and a fundamental principle of our justice 
system -- that the punishment should be fair, that it should fit the crime. 
Existing mandatory minimum laws are problematic; "three strikes" proposals are 
mandatory minimums in another guise. And those that sweep nonviolent felons 
into prison for life wouldn't be smart policy either. These proposals make 
sense only when they are targeted on repeat felons with a record of violence. 
The Times endorses that approach. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Do federal prisons have room to house three-time felons for life? 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, no. The federal prison population is already 40% over capacity and 
growing at the fastest rate in the world.  
</P>
<P>
 When Atty. Gen. Janet Reno launched an inquiry last year into the composition 
of the federal prison population, she asked whether beds in overcrowded federal 
prison facilities were, in effect, being wasted on low-level nonviolent 
offenders as a result of those laws. As suspected, the study, issued earlier 
this month, found that about one of every five federal prisoners -- 16,316 in 
all -- are "low-level" offenders. Two-thirds of those inmates were serving a 
mandatory minimum sentence. The federal inmate population already is projected 
to grow significantly as more crimes become federal offenses. If a federal 
"three strikes" law passes, repeat felons sentenced to life can be accommodated 
only if Congress rethinks the unrealistic sentencing guidelines it imposed 
earlier for some nonviolent offenders.  
</P>
<P>
 The people deserve full answers to the questions surrounding "three strikes." 
Those answers aren't likely to be the stuff of slogans but surely they will be 
the foundation of sound public policy. And a safer America as well.

QUAKE AND L.A. DRIVING HABITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although making it more expensive or more difficult to drive your car to work 
might help make commuters change to mass transit ("Quake Fuels Only a Brief 
Affair With Mass Transit," by Nora Zamichow, Feb. 12), mass transit operators 
could attract more riders by at least delivering the service they post in their 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 In my daily commute, I regularly wait 15 to 20 minutes for buses that are 
scheduled to arrive every eight minutes. Then the buses arrive in clusters. 
Because of this, my 30-minute commute is extended to 45-50 minutes three or 
four times a week. The distance is only seven miles, and I can do it by car in 
about 20 minutes. Taking the bus may be worth it at 30 minutes, but it may not 
be at 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 I know there are people who commute a lot farther, but the same principle 
applies. I have written the MTA, but officials don't seem to be able to solve 
the problem. More focus should be put on improving the delivery of the mass 
transit service, or more of us may go back to our cars, not just those affected 
by the earthquake.

 * Given the expense, complexity and sheer human effort required for most 
people to commute via Metrolink and our other mass transit options, is it 
really any wonder that ridership declined once the road system was again an 
alternative, however horrific? But instead of continuing to blame our supposed 
"romance" with the automobile, how about pointing out the obvious: Our public 
transit planners have designed a system that fails to take people quickly and 
easily where they want to go. This is most obvious on the Westside, where the 
fact that a Downtown-to-ocean transit line isn't even in the planning stages 
seems especially absurd, given the collapse of the Santa Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Build a rapid transit system between heavily traveled places that can offer a 
true alternative to the auto in price, convenience and time, and people will 
use it. Otherwise, why are we wasting all this time and money?

 * I was pleased to see that Zamichow seems to understand that a commute 
includes a number of segments, only one of which is a high-speed mass transit 
mode. If you were to dissect the trip from Santa Clarita she describes, you 
would find that Metrolink represents only a small fraction of the total 
door-to-door commute time. This is the aspect of travel-to-work our 
transportation planners have not faced up to. If mass transit is to work, then 
either everyone's ultimate destination must be Union Station (obviously 
impossible) or there must be reasonable transportation modes connecting Union 
Station with workplaces. Having to take several very slow buses to reach 
Century City from Union Station is unreasonable, and travelers-to-work will not 
do it. 
</P>
<P>
 In her Feb. 13 article, Zamichow mentions jitneys, a concept long considered 
but never implemented. Employer-supplied vans are another possibility, as are 
express buses dedicated to taking busloads of workers to high-density 
employment centers such as Century City. Commuting is a system problem, and 
simply solving one segment of it is not very helpful.

 * Your article makes it sound as if correcting the market forces which govern 
travelers' choices would be punitive. You put the wrong spin on the answer to 
your own question, "If a magnitude 6.8 quake will not permanently change solo 
driving habits, then what will?" The answer is obvious. And sensible. Remove 
the enormous subsidies which force commuters and shoppers to drive their cars.  
</P>
<P>
 Driving would become convenient again; tax levels would decrease. We would 
have a less-costly alternative to the private, one-rider automobile. Each of us 
would have more money in our jeans and in our savings accounts. Our police, our 
schools and our libraries would have adequate funding. Air pollution would 
decrease.  
</P>
<P>
 Our present automobile- and truck-only freeway system is the world's most 
costly (in dollars as well as in societal impacts). We are throwing away 25% of 
our earnings on automobiles, highways, trucking and services. Costs, of course, 
are tucked away everywhere, including increased taxes and retail prices.  
</P>
<P>
 There is already a law on the books to cash out some of our "free" parking; it 
would add 5% to 8% to paychecks. It must be implemented by the cities and 
counties of California. An initiative is being prepared to put into place a 
pay-at-the-gas-pump method to pay for automobile insurance. Get behind it. It 
will save each of us hundreds of dollars each year.

WOMEN'S MOVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "MacKinnon Does Not Speak for Me," Column Left, Feb. 9: 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Rosen should know better. The women's movement is not monolithic.No one 
decides what subject the entire movement should work on. Each woman works on 
the area of interest to her; which means that Catherine MacKinnon works on 
pornography. This does not mean that the women's movement "has been derailed." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands contribute to "Emily's List," hundreds of thousands march and work 
for choice, hundreds work with battered women, with legislators, on child care, 
child abuse, sexual harassment, etc. Believe me, there is enough anguish for 
each woman in the movement to have plenty to choose from. Why shouldn't 
MacKinnon have the same right? 
</P>
<P>
 And what gives Rosen the right to decide on the preeminent issue for all of 
us? Of course, poverty issues are important. And thousands of women work on 
those issues. But other feminists may work on art or performance or writing; 
and their contributions are important and welcome, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Get real, Dr. Rosen. The women's movement is not a dictatorship. You, as a 
historian, should know that.

A KINDNESS IN RAIN

 * Unfortunately, it isn't very often that we take the time to write concerning 
a very nice happening in Los Angeles.However, being a New Englander (proud of 
it too), and finding so many skeptics in these parts, I must say I was 
overwhelmed the other evening. When waiting for the bus in a rare "driving 
rainstorm" at the corner of Robertson and 3rd Street, a very kind parking lot 
attendant removed his rain slicker and insisted on my wearing it home. Perhaps 
these types of things do happen in L.A., but how often do we really take the 
time to say "thank you" publicly?

DEFENSE CONVERSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Times has reported the very depressing results of a survey of 
high-technology defense firms in Los Angeles County that cast serious doubts on 
their ability to convert to a commercial footing ("Defense Contractors Fail to 
Convert, Study Finds," Feb. 9). 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the "culture" of doing business in defense is markedly different from 
that of the commercial world, and it has been shown to be not very adaptable. 
It is hoped that some of this will be rectified by the government's current 
interest in overhauling the defense acquisition system. An additional and very 
important factor in defense technology conversion is the new government 
emphasis upon dual-use technology developments sponsored by the Departments of 
Defense and Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 It is interesting that Michael Boskin, former economic adviser to President 
Bush, absolutely forbade any consideration of dual-use development during their 
reign, contending that the government must stay out of "industrial policy." 
This inhibited the United States from exploiting the commercial applicability 
of much of our defense technology developments not only domestically, but also 
in international competition. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a bit repulsive to read Boskin's current pleas for increasing "pork 
barrel" defense contracting to California in order to assist in our state's 
economic recovery (Feb 6). This would appear to be completely antithetical to 
his image as a conservative economist. It is clear, though, that Boskin does 
share President Bush's abhorrence of the "vision thing."

 * Your article omits an important fact. The path to success for the corporate 
hierarchy is to reduce head-count and downsize their company. We are still in 
the nightmare grasp of the Harvard MBAs who look for a quick quarterly profit 
to show the stockholder. McDonnell stock went from $38 per share to over $115 
by promising to downsize. Unfortunately, most of the downsizing will be done in 
the L.A. Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 In the industrial climate that I have described, how can you expect companies 
to hang on to high-priced help and invest in research and development? Japanese 
companies had been giving research grants to universities and buying our 
research-and-development oriented companies so that they could own the results 
of our inventive genius. The present economic slump in Japan has put a damper 
on these activities. Inventive genius would seem to have little value in either 
country at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 I can offer no answers, other than that we need a long-term commitment from 
the federal government. I do not see any real answers coming from a man who 
dealt with an economy smaller than that of the Los Angeles area.

MUCH TOO UNIFORM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Uniforms, once a badge of parochial or private schools, are increasingly 
common on public school campuses -- and with good reason. Neutral clothing can 
provide safe passage for children who must negotiate gang territories going to 
and from school. 
</P>
<P>
 State law doesn't allow public school districts to require uniforms -- no 
child can be forced to buy something in order to attend public school. However, 
dozens of campuses in the San Fernando Valley, Crenshaw district and Hollywood 
section of Los Angeles and the La Habra, Huntington Park, Santa Ana, Fullerton 
and Brea districts in Orange County have adopted voluntary policies. 
</P>
<P>
 A bill pending in Sacramento would allow districts to require uniforms. In 
anticipation of the new law, the Long Beach school board has voted to require 
uniforms at all elementary and middle schools next year. The dress would differ 
from campus to campus because parents and staff at each school would decide on 
the best uniform. The schools would use donations to provide uniforms for poor 
children. Safety is the primary concern of parents and educators who encourage 
the identical dress. Children clad in uniforms need not worry about gang 
colors. Also, outsiders who don't belong on campus are easily identified. 
</P>
<P>
 School uniforms aren't a cure-all, but the regimented dress can provide a 
neutral coat of arms for children whose clothing might otherwise make them 
targets. It is a policy worth trying, though we do have reservations about 
empowering school districts to require uniforms. Far better to let each school 
make an individual determination.

By SAM CARR POLK is a retired lawyer in Santa Monica. He told The Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pets and wild animals are known to make strange sounds and behave in unusual 
ways before an earthquake -- sometimes hours before. Scientists don't yet know 
why. 
</P>
<P>
 Some friends of mine in Bel-Air were horrified, on the Sunday evening before 
the Northridge quake, when 13 large rats invaded their home by way of a pet 
door. Chasing them out was a harrowing experience, and my friends went to bed 
exhausted -- only to be awakened at 4:31 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 There are similar examples from around the world, ancient and modern. We 
humans should take advantage of this behavior of our fellow creatures in 
preparing for "the Big One." 
</P>
<P>
 Threatened areas could form a special "quake district" with residents alerted 
to call in strange animal behavior to an information center. Seismologists 
would make regular reports to the center on geological and physical evidence of 
an impending quake, such as changes in magnetic or electrical fields and in 
well-water levels. 
</P>
<P>
 A pre-selected group of experts would review any flurry of such reports and 
decide whether to call a quake alert. If they decided there was, say, a 60% or 
greater probability of a quake within the next 12 hours, sirens would sound and 
media would broadcast a warning. Public-safety employees would immediately 
report for work. Volunteer wardens would empty dangerous buildings; relief 
agencies would prepare emergency housing. 
</P>
<P>
 If an alert turned out to be a false alarm, its expense could be justified as 
a public drill to test our preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a program will meet resistance, of course, mainly because it is not 
"scientific." Voters can organize to pressure politicians and educate fellow 
voters. I have started a group called the Southern California Assn. to Reduce 
Earthquake Damage -- SCARED, for short. Its motto: "Scared of the Big One? Join 
the club."

PERSPECTIVE ON MEXICO; CLEAR THE AIR FOR A CLEAN ELECTION; CHIAPAS EXPOSES 
SALINAS' SHORTCOMINGS. IF HE'LL ADMIT THEM AND MAKE AMENDS, THE RISK OF TURMOIL 
IS REDUCED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JORGE G. CASTANEDA, Jorge G. Castaneda is a frequent contributor writing 
from Mexico City. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The peasant rebellion in Chiapas has produced no more fighting since early 
January, but its political effects continue to reverberate throughout Mexico. 
Negotiations between the indigenous insurgents and the government of Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari are just beginning, but talks between officials and the 
national political opposition have been under way for several weeks and may 
come to fruition before the Chiapas talks do. It may well be precisely because 
the problems in Chiapas are so intractable, and the need for the government to 
show some results and good faith so great, that authentic electoral reform in 
Mexico may be finally forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for the Salinas administration's new, apparent flexibility, are 
evident. First, it has to come up with something in the way of addressing the 
Zapatista National Liberation Army's demands, and clean elections are certainly 
one of them. Second and most important is the unprecedented risk of turmoil and 
strife if the Aug. 21 presidential election is perceived as fraudulent. This 
time around, unlike 1988, arms are involved, and the Zapatistas'lesson of how 
much a little violence can achieve is telling. Moreover, opposition leader 
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas is gaining ground, if only slightly, and he surely will do 
better than the lowly third place and a humiliating 10% to 15% of the vote that 
was predicted a few months ago. Thus, if Cardenas contests an electoral result 
that does not grant him victory, Mexico's famed stability will come to an end. 
Finally, there is the foreign factor: Stealing an election in broad daylight, 
or being deservedly accused of doing so by a significant share of the 
electorate, is bad for business, bad for NAFTA, bad for those in the United 
States who have bet on President Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
 What will constitute electoral reform? The broad agenda is well known, but the 
devil is in the details. The rolls have to be audited and cleansed so that the 
dead stop voting and the living start. Electoral bodies must be restaffed in 
order to become independent; for now, from the very top all the way to the most 
remote polling booth, the government and the ruling PRI (Institutional 
Revolutionary Party) have a built-in majority. Limits must be set on campaign 
financing and spending, both to avoid incidents like last year's $750-million 
shakedown dinner attended by Mexico's business magnates and to sever the 
umbilical cord between the PRI and government. Access to the media must be 
assured, and television coverage -- the major source of news for most Mexicans 
-- must be made fair and equitable. Finally, the issue of national and foreign 
election observers must be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this must be fleshed out in detail by all three main political parties: 
the PRI, the PAN (National Action Party) and Cardenas' PRD (Democratic 
Revolutionary Party). Cardenas' agreement is critical, for he would have to be 
satisfied that the vote was fair if he were to accept a negative result for 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the circumstances in post-Chiapas Mexico, were elections free and fair, 
the PRI might lose them. The economy experienced zero growth in 1993; the 
distribution of income has continued to deteriorate, along with the job market; 
the uprising in Chiapas has left much of the country feeling guilty over its 
mistreatment of the indigenous people throughout Mexico. The PRI is divided 
between factions favoring Luis Donaldo Colosio and Manuel Camacho. Colosio is 
Salinas' anointed successor, Camacho the lonely runner-up. Now, as Salinas' 
peace negotiator in Chiapas, Camacho's popularity grows by leaps and bounds as 
his influence within the PRI wanes. Insurrections are breaking out across the 
Mexican countryside, the public sector growing increasingly contemptuous of a 
political system seen as corrupt, anti-democratic, ineffective and no longer 
synonymous with stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Can Cardenas win if elections are clean and the process is equitable? It 
depends largely on the type of campaign that develops, and this in turn hinges 
on what President Salinas decides to do. If the campaign focuses on his 
administration and the election becomes a referendum on it, the opposition's 
chances are good. It is easier to criticize a flawed regime than to propose 
remedies. Cardenas has found his sea legs in his daily attacks on the 
government, and Colosio seems ill at ease defending Salinas' record -- which is 
not, after all, his record. 
</P>
<P>
 If the campaign is to be more than a judgment of Salinas' record, someone 
other than the opposition will have to do the judging. And that someone is 
Salinas himself. Only he can spell out clearly the profound, substantive 
mistakes of his administration: where things went wrong, what the erroneous 
decisions were, who made them and why, not just in Chiapas, but in the entire 
course of his term. By taking on the past himself, he would force those who 
would succeed him to talk about the future. That would free Colosio to present 
his own ideas instead of having to defend Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-immolation has for years been a fixture of Mexico's political system. 
Virtually every president has engaged in it; they have had no choice. The 
system that Salinas will live and die by has its traditions. Political, if not 
human, sacrifice is one; he, too, may have no choice.

WE LOVE OUR BAD BOYS, BUT NOT OUR BAD GIRLS

<TEXT>
<P>
 We now know Tonya Harding's story, and it isn't pretty. Bad attitude. Foul 
language. Mean friends. Not exactly a role model. 
</P>
<P>
 But forget the knee-whacking for a moment. If Harding were a guy, she'd be 
rich. 
</P>
<P>
 Impounded cars, homemade outfits, broken skates -- all history with a simple 
gender change. A male athlete who scraped and clawed his way out of Harding's 
life to become a world-ranked amateur could sneer with impunity and still pay 
the rent. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, criminal behavior can cramp a man's income. Witness Mike Tyson. But let's 
just take all individuals currently serving time in prison out of this debate. 
</P>
<P>
 What we have is two completely different standards. And don't try to argue 
that Harding doesn't win often enough to rate endorsements. That hasn't stopped 
Dan and Dave of Reebok fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Being bad can be great for male athletes. Bad means commitment, aggressiveness 
and makes for good anecdotes. Bad is something that the men who shape our 
images of sports understand. And bad is often irrelevant when corporate America 
opens its checkbook -- if the athlete is male, like that recently retired 
basketball superstar who had a weakness for gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Barkley has made millions getting right in our face and making sure we 
know he's not a stinking role model. Mike Ditka was the cuddly curmudgeon of 
this year's Bud Bowl. And no weekend ballplayer in America picks up a Jose 
Canseco bat and whines, "I can't use this. This guy was charged with a crime." 
</P>
<P>
 But if the athlete is a woman, revise everything. 
</P>
<P>
 American capitalism celebrates female athletes in pretty sports like 
gymnastics and ice skating. Shot-putters need not apply. And "our girls" better 
be pure. Harding's edges were always too sharp for her to be America's 
sweetheart. 
</P>
<P>
 This doesn't take anything away from Nancy Kerrigan simply because she is 
positively perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is a little sad that Harding seemed to be one of the few people in 
America who really believed she would finally become rich if she only won a 
gold medal. She actually thought that was all it would take.

COLUMN LEFT/ RAMSEY CLARK: IRAQ EMBARGO IS KILLING KIDS; END IT NOW; THE UNITED 
NATIONS SHOULD DECLARE SUCH ECONOMIC ASSAULTS TO BE CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAMSEY CLARK, Ramsey Clark was U.S. attorney general from 1966-69. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the fourth consecutive February, I have made the long road trip to Iraq 
under embargo. First it was to assess the effect of the U.S. bombing that 
became an admitted 110,000 aerial sorties, 88,500 tons of bombs -- seven 
Hiroshimas -- augmented by many rockets and missiles including 56,000 with 
depleted uranium tips. Most of the civilian targets were admittedly chosen to 
accelerate the effect of the sanctions: water supply facilities, food 
production and distribution including poultry and livestock operations, and 
food processing plants. The deadliness of the sanctions initiated in August, 
1990, was already clear in February, 1991. The director of the Red Crescent of 
Iraq estimated 6,000 dead children, most infants needing milk supplement and 
simple medicines, others from dehydration.  
</P>
<P>
 In the following years, I observed the devastating effect of the blockade on 
the entire population. Through 1991 and 1992, thousands died monthly as a 
direct result of the sanctions, including epidemics and large increases in 
infectious diseases arising from the lack of vaccines and destroyed sanitation 
facilities. In 1993, deaths above the normal rate caused by the blockade 
exceeded 125,000. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes little thought to know who is first and most affected by the economic 
blockade of a whole nation. It is the poor, their infants, children, 
chronically ill and elderly. Most of the more than 375,000 who have died in 
Iraq have been from these three groups. Others have suffered terribly. There 
are thousands of undersized infants, weighing less than 5 1/2 pounds at birth, 
tens of thousands of victims of kwashiorkor and and marasmus, forms of 
malnutrition virtually unknown in Iraq before the Gulf crisis. The little 
bodies and limbs waste away, the belly bloats. The chronically ill often die 
for the lack of insulin, or medicines for heart, lung, liver, kidney or other 
common ailments. Cases requiring surgery -- performed in only a few hospitals 
for want of anesthetics, sutures, gloves and compresses -- must wait. The 
elderly live through their last days without sufficient food or even common 
painkillers like aspirin. Food consumption for the country is half what it was 
before the embargo. Available medicine is less than 15% of before.  
</P>
<P>
 The sanctions are a weapon of mass destruction attacking an entire nation at 
once, injuring all physically, mentally and spiritually. Severe physical 
handicaps will afflict many who survive. The life expectancy for the whole 
population is radically reduced. Tragically, hundreds of millions on the planet 
suffer a similar fate because those with power fail to act to end hunger, 
starvation, sickness and epidemics. 
</P>
<P>
 The people of Iraq suffer because the United Nations, coerced by the United 
States, has acted knowingly and deliberately to cause their suffering. This 
takes a terrible toll on faith in the future and belief that the Untied Nations 
seeks justice and to end the scourge of war. 
</P>
<P>
 In times of the most dangerous war, even if required to avoid defeat, 
international law prohibits assaults on the civilian sector. All humanitarian 
law has strived to preserve nonmilitary parts of society, to prevent the use of 
cruel weapons of death and weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 How then is it possible that the United Nations would authorize the cruelest 
weapon for destruction of the masses, knowing its first and primary effect will 
be on the poor, infants, children, sick people and those we should respect 
most, our elders? And that in time of peace. There can be no possible 
justification or avoidance of responsibility for these deaths. If law prohibits 
even minimal assault on civilians in time of war, when a government will not 
surrender, can it permit peacetime assault on an entire nation when its 
government will not submit, hitting the poorest and the weakest hardest and 
killing the most fragile? 
</P>
<P>
 The sanctions against Iraq must end immediately. Time taken to save face or 
find an excuse will cost several hundred lives each day, more than five times 
the 68 deaths at the market at Sarajevo that so rightfully outraged the world. 
Yet who bears the greater culpability, soldiers facing the horror of prolonged 
combat in the midst of mindless violence or heads of state and diplomats in 
cool reflection who unleash the worst horsemen of the apocalypse on the 
children and babies and sick and grandparents while cursing the evil of their 
adversary? 
</P>
<P>
 Only the prohibition of sanctions by the United Nations and a new covenant 
proclaiming economic assaults on a whole people to be a crime against humanity 
will show we can learn from the mistakes of the past. Only then will these 
tragic deaths not have been entirely in vain.

COLUMN RIGHT/ CLINT BOLICK: ASK THE TOUGH QUESTIONS ON CIVIL RIGHTS; PATRICK 
COMES FROM THE SAME PHILOSOPHICAL BASE AS GUINIER, ONLY HE HASN'T WRITTEN ABOUT 
IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLINT BOLICK, Clint Bolick is litigation director at the Institute for 
Justice in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When he nominated Deval Patrick to be assistant attorney general for civil 
rights, President Clinton lashed out against anyone who would dare raise 
questions about his nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those people," Clinton asserted in his podium-thumping diatribe referring to 
me and my colleagues at the Institute for Justice, "never believed in equal 
opportunity, they never lifted a finger to give anybody of a minority race a 
chance in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 One would think Clinton would have learned from the mess he made of the Lani 
Guinier nomination. But for the second time, Clinton seems either to have 
nominated someone to this vitally important post whose civil-rights views he 
doesn't know, or to have embraced a civil-rights philosophy at odds with the 
position he took as a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 And he surely didn't do his homework when he flung the attack our way. Since 
co-founding the Institute for Justice in 1991, my colleagues and I have fought 
relentlessly in the courts to help people outside the economic mainstream gain 
a share of the American Dream. Among many other cases, we are helping secure 
brighter educational futures for low-income children in Los Angeles and 
fighting for inner-city entrepreneurs whose livelihoods are being reclaimed 
from oppressive government regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure Patrick has experienced similar rewards in his career as a 
public-interest litigator for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, on whose board of 
directors Patrick now sits. But there's an important difference between the 
aims of the Institute for Justice and the Legal Defense Fund, one that gave 
rise to our opposition to Guinier and the questions we raise of Patrick: the 
extent to which solutions to our society's problems should be based on race. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton seemed to recognize this distinction during the campaign, when he 
distanced himself from prevailing civil-rights orthodoxy and embraced equal 
opportunity rather than equality of results -- a principle the overwhelming 
majority of Americans, both white and black, support. 
</P>
<P>
 But since his election, Clinton has veered from his rhetoric. His withdrawal 
of Guinier's nomination evoked a firestorm from inside-the-Beltway civil-rights 
groups. Instead of sticking to his stated principles, he tried to placate these 
groups by filling the vacancy from their ranks. But he found, as a lawyer from 
one of the groups remarked to Legal Times, that Guinier's views are widely 
shared within the civil-rights lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 That's precisely the problem: groups like LDF, which did so much good for 
America, have moved away from the very civil-rights consensus they helped 
create. As even their own surveys demonstrate, the views of Establishment 
civil-rights groups on issues such as race quotas, busing and crime stray far 
from the views of mainstream Americans and people the groups claim to 
represent. 
</P>
<P>
 When Clinton went outside the fold to name District of Columbia corporation 
counsel John Payton to this post, the move was vetoed by the Congressional 
Black Caucus. Ultimately, Clinton returned for his nominee to the same 
organization that produced Lani Guinier. 
</P>
<P>
 The only sure difference between Guinier and Patrick, who both worked for the 
LDF, is that Guinier has published her views while Patrick has not. As an LDF 
lawyer, Patrick pushed the view that fair policies that produce 
disproportionate outcomes are unconstitutional -- precisely the equal-results 
standard Clinton rejected in the campaign. The LDF in recent years has pursued 
an unabashedly race-conscious agenda, including quotas, set-asides and racially 
gerrymandered voting districts. It has argued that forced busing must continue 
decades after schools are desegregated, even if the burden falls on black 
children and their parents want it to stop. The question arises: Will LDF's 
agenda be Patrick's agenda in office?  
</P>
<P>
 The assistant attorney general controls a vast legal staff with wide 
discretion in cases involving employment, education, housing and voting matters 
that touch the lives of every American. The direction this official takes will 
in large measure determine whether we continue down the disastrous road of race 
preferences and social engineering or pursue a path of equal opportunity and 
individual empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence specific questions need to be asked about where Patrick stands on 
crucial civil-rights law enforcement issues. The answers may tell us a great 
deal about the President's civil-rights agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope the Senate Judiciary Committee will ignore Clinton's histrionics and 
ask tough questions of Patrick. If so, we may find he is willing to move beyond 
the orthodoxy that has sapped the civil-rights Establishment's effectiveness 
and moral vitality. I hope so.

BOOK REVIEW / HISTORY; DISEASE 'LURKS' ON IMMIGRANTS' PATH; SILENT TRAVELERS:

 In science fiction, astronauts are disinfected to neutralize bacteria and 
"outside" diseases that might contaminate Earth or earthlings. In the American 
experience, we have disinfected immigrants, both literally and metaphorically, 
assuming that something disgusting from "out there" must be carried in the 
baggage of strangers.  
</P>
<P>
 Alan Kraut, a professor of history at American University, points out that 
Americans have always tended to see disease and degeneracy lurking in the 
bodies of newcomers.  
</P>
<P>
 His "Silent Travelers" is at once an object lesson in what we have done right 
and wrong in the past and a fascinating chronicle of America's efforts, 
especially after the Civil War, to cope with immigrants whose labor we needed 
but whose foreignness we found frightening. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every national or ethnic group that has migrated to the United States, 
Kraut writes, was greeted by hostility and bureaucratic insensitivity. While it 
goes against the grain of our national self-image to dislike people because of 
their religion or their ideas, we felt justified in defending our families from 
disease.  
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, through waves of immigration, Americans have blamed the Irish 
for bringing cholera in the 19th Century, the Italians for bringing polio, the 
Chinese for carrying bubonic plague, the Jews for spreading tuberculosis and 
the Haitians for bringing AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The undesirables were defined, in part (quoting from the 1903 and 1917 
editions of the "Book of Instructions for the Medical Inspection of 
Immigrants," listed in Kraut's appendixes) as "persons of constitutional 
psychopathic inferiority," people with ringworm or "Loathsome Diseases": 
venereal diseases, hernia, chronic arthritis, varicose veins and "defects of 
vision" -- unaided vision of 20/70 or less. 
</P>
<P>
 This sieve wasn't as fine as it might seem, because the brunt of carrying out 
these regulations fell to the shipping lines that profited from selling tickets 
to those wishing to immigrate to America. Still, the fear of rejection was 
real, as we see poignantly in Kraut's interviews with immigrants who recall the 
fear and humiliation of the medical examination at Ellis Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Kraut follows these immigrants into the crowded tenements of New York, Boston 
and San Francisco, where public health workers used medicine to Americanize 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Visiting nurses, for instance, instructed women in personal hygiene and 
nutrition, helping them in some ways but at the same time estranging them from 
their traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 He also describes how some immigrants fought back. Irish and Italian 
Catholics, for instance, opened their own hospitals to free themselves from 
Protestant proselytizing. Jews built medical centers where they could keep 
kosher and where, eventually, their children who studied medicine could find 
hospital affiliations when anti-Semitism barred them from older establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Kraut includes stories of people such as the young Irish immigrant Mary Malone 
-- known to legend as "Typhoid Mary" -- who worked as a cook and spread deadly 
typhoid fever.  
</P>
<P>
 Mary was discovered by medical sleuthing, incarcerated by the New York Board 
of Health, then released on the grounds that her civil rights had been trampled 
after she promised to refrain from working as a cook. She broke her word, 
changed her name and infected another 20 people before she was found again. 
Mary was then incarcerated for the rest of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Memories of Mary undoubtedly led in part to the repressive measures taken at 
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in 1992, where Haitian refugees who tested positive for 
HIV were held in "the kind of indefinite detention usually reserved for spies 
and murderers." 
</P>
<P>
 The association of disease with immigrants is only part of Kraut's tale. He 
also describes the racist roots of the immigration bill of 1924 that kept 
Jewish refugees on the St. Louis from entering America in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
 A move to liberalize the bill was killed by the influence of people such as 
Laura Delano, the wife of the immigration commissioner and President Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt's cousin. Delano was overheard objecting to admitting "20,000 
charming children (who would) all too soon grow into 20,000 ugly adults." 
</P>
<P>
 Kraut introduces himself as the grandson of a tailor who made it through the 
immigrant health hoop to settle on New York's Lower East Side. Defending the 
rights of all immigrants, he distinguishes the real public health problems 
posed by disease transmitters such as Mary Malone from the voices of prejudice 
that exploit our fear of disease for their propaganda war against America's 
tradition of welcoming strangers.

FITNESS / KATHLEEN DOHENY: A SESSION OF YOGA COULD BE EXERCISE FOR BODY AND 
SOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 B reathe . . . Feel grounded.  
</P>
<P>
 As instructor Fred Miller concludes his class at Angel City Yoga in Studio 
City, he can't resist adding words of encouragement for his beginning students 
who have fallen short of perfect headstands. "This will be more and more fun," 
he promises with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Legions of yoga teachers and new practitioners share his enthusiasm these 
days, as the ancient mind-body workout enjoys a rebirth. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes abound -- not just at specialized centers, but at health clubs, where 
yoga sessions are turning up on the schedule next to step aerobics classes. 
Stay-at-homes can follow their favorite instructor on TV or pick from a growing 
array of yoga videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Coupled with other preventive health habits, yoga can help prevent or reverse 
heart disease, some claim. Recently, the National Institutes of Health's Office 
of Alternative Medicine funded research studies to evaluate yoga as a treatment 
for heroin addiction and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Even pro basketball 
players have been known to do yoga to "center themselves" before a big game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Forget That Pretzel Image: The stereotype of yoga -- assume a pretzel position 
and chant -- is off the mark. What most of us consider yoga is actually several 
systems. Most commonly taught in the United States are Hatha and Kundalini 
yoga. 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of most yoga is meditation, stretching, breathing and body 
awareness. Students assume certain postures (asanas) and hold them to 
strengthen. The word yoga comes from the Sanskrit root yug , which means "to 
join together" or "yoke," says Linda Gajevski, a spokeswoman for the American 
Yoga Assn., a school and nonprofit educational organization based in Cleveland, 
Ohio. Through yoga, practitioners can end the "separateness" internally and 
between yourself and the world. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Benefits: Yoga can strengthen the immune system, improve flexibility and 
strength, give relief from back pain and other discomfort, and improve general 
well-being. Very advanced students can exert themselves enough to raise the 
heart rate to a training level, says Gajevski, "but it's not the primary goal 
of what we teach." 
</P>
<P>
 Yoga is a powerful stress reducer, says Dr. Dean Ornish, director of the 
Preventive Medicine Research Institute in Sausalito. He discusses the value of 
yoga in his 1990 bestseller, "Dr. Dean Ornish's Program for Reversing Heart 
Disease." He recommends yoga along with a program of group support, a low-fat 
vegetarian diet and moderate exercise for heart disease prevention and 
reversal. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoga will also produce "a pliable body and good posture," says Christine Kaur, 
a Los Angeles instructor who hosts a cable television yoga show. "It gives you 
a mental focus. It totally works the body, elevates the mind and focuses the 
spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Picture: Some practitioners do nothing but yoga for exercise; others 
supplement yoga with other activities, such as weight lifting, martial arts and 
stair climbing. Yoga is one of the easiest workouts to adhere to, Kaur says: 
"You can do it anywhere, anytime. There's no machinery needed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other Applications: For 25 years, yoga has been an integral part of a program 
at Super Health Ranch, a Tucson holistic health center providing programs for 
those trying to kick drug addictions or reduce stress. 
</P>
<P>
 In two government-funded studies, researchers will evaluate whether yoga helps 
in the treatment of heroin addicts and those with obsessive compulsive 
disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Getting Started: If you're new to yoga, observe a class or take several types 
of classes to see what suits you, experts suggest. Try to find a class for 
beginners so you're not intimidated by advanced students. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget that high-impact aerobics mentality, complete with mirrors and its 
"see-and-be-seen" flamboyance. Instructor Miller, in fact, specifically asks 
students to face the non-mirrored wall during his class so they don't get hung 
up looking at themselves or classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most important is to find a good teacher," Kaur says. That can take patience, 
adds Gajevski of the American Yoga Assn., because there is no nationally 
recognized standard for certification of yoga teachers. But ask questions to 
determine training, she recommends. Find out if your yoga teacher has studied 
with a teacher, and still does, or whether he or she attended an institute or 
school. Competent teachers, Gajevski says, should also have a working knowledge 
of major muscle groups and body systems, and be able to vary the techniques 
based on each student's capability.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chill Out: Remember to relax. Making the mental switch from competitive, 
high-impact exercise to the more mellow attitude yoga demands is vital.  
</P>
<P>
 "A healthy body is one that can be strong when it has to and let go when it 
doesn't have to work so hard," Cam Nguyen, a yoga instructor at the Sports 
Club/LA, tells her students. "This is quality time with yourself."

ART REVIEW; SMALL THINGS MEAN A LOT AT THE GETTY; TWO EXHIBITIONS, 'LITTLE 
PICTURES' AND 'HARMONIES OF HEAVEN AND EARTH,' REVEAL PHOTOS AND ILLUMINATED 
MANUSCRIPTS IN MINIATURIZED FORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 High school kids used to carry around these fat wallets. They didn't 
necessarily have any money in them. The bulk came from layers of plastic 
windows encasing myriad postage-stamp size photo portraits of friends. They 
were cherished like collections of mounted butterflies. To have them was 
somehow to possess the spirits of admired mates. The ultimate form of this for 
girls was a tiny picture of her steady in a locket. 
</P>
<P>
 Origins of this practice are reflected in two engaging jewel-box exhibitions 
at the J. Paul Getty Museum. "Little Pictures" and "Harmonies of Heaven and 
Earth" consist, respectively, of photos and illuminated manuscripts. Their 
subjects are different but they are crucially linked. Both are about the magic 
of miniaturization. Making things small has become a big issue in this culture. 
It touches everything from the computer chip to the general feeling of 
shrinkage in economically strapped times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Little Pictures," selected from the permanent collection by curator Weston 
Naef, easily fits some 300 photos into a small gallery. The show chronicles its 
subject from 1848 to 1920, showing its rise as a popular novelty. 
</P>
<P>
 Primitive photographs were obliged to be small because the lenses that took 
them were. Sometimes images were literally taken through microscope glasses. 
The diminutive results charmed people by recording a lot of realistic detail 
that seemed perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was fun and it carried the cachet of two rising cultural gods -- mechanics 
and science. It was the 19th Century's version of computer special effects and 
graphics. Look, Ma, I shrunk the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Teeny photos took many forms. Calling cards of and by photographer Camille 
Silvy and his wife are less portraits of them than of their best clothes. But 
there are little likenesses of everybody from Abraham Lincoln to Queen 
Victoria, Florence Nightingale, Annie Oakley and a famous daguerreotype of 
Edgar Allan Poe looking like a tortured genius. The beginnings of the celebrity 
snap. 
</P>
<P>
 The great hoot of the thing is the way an awesome scientific discovery comes 
toddling into the world in the swaddling of toy and carnival midway amusement. 
Naturally that always includes Little Egypt, so we have the version of the 
Naughty French Postcard. Easy to conceal from the missus. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally such art must include something scary posing as something serious. 
So we have stereographs of skulls, dancing skeletons, a mouthful of syphilis 
and a woman with a skin rash so bad you can write your name in it. How 
disgusting. How delightful. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything calculated to bring a lump to the throat gets in the act, patriotic 
scenes, mighty new suspension bridges to make you proud of your country, 
fraternal organizations, adorable kids and a cat with a fiddle.  
</P>
<P>
 As if photography were not miraculous enough in itself, Boston photographer 
William H. Mummler did a brisk business in "Spirit Photography" until his mumbo 
jumbo was denounced as a fraud. Today we call his occult double-cross a double 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 It's testament to the skill and enthusiasm of the photographers that all this 
kitsch remains fresh and authentically touching. 
</P>
<P>
 Photography, of course, didn't invent miniaturization. Nobody knows who did 
but manuscript illumination is older and thus closer to the source. The Getty's 
current exhibition of about 20 examples overtly deals with "Harmonies of Heaven 
and Earth: Musicians and Instruments in Medieval and Renaissance Manuscripts." 
</P>
<P>
 Concocted by curator Thomas Kren, it paints an exquisitely diminutive picture 
suggesting the sounds of the era wafting from such ancestral instruments as 
vielle, mandora, shawn, naker and the cymbala. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of esoteric original instrument recordings will find all that 
fascinating. The rest of us can be entertainingly instructed by evidence of the 
rich workings of the medieval mind. 
</P>
<P>
 It clearly believed in the idea of expressing the macrocosm through the 
microcosm, witness fully worked-up scenes so tiny that viewers would do well to 
bring along their magnifying glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet these diminutive images deal with great ideas and they range broadly 
beyond the cliche view of a period entirely dominated by liturgical thought. 
</P>
<P>
 It's certainly there in a 13th-Century psalter from Wurzburg. A page 
emblazoned with the initial "B" shows David divinely soothing King Saul with 
his harp while nearby he bloodily beheads Goliath. 
</P>
<P>
 The image suggests a decided moral ambivalence toward music that remains 
abroad today in recurrent controversies about dirty words hidden in rock lyrics 
and politically incorrect sentiments in rap rhymes. 
</P>
<P>
 A case of illustrations about the Apocalypse finds music simultaneously cast 
as the soundtrack for the crack of doom, the accompaniment of heavenly 
salvation and the trumpet of the wrath of God. 
</P>
<P>
 The next thing you know a late 15th-Century volume from Ghent, Vincent de 
Beauvais' "Mirror of History," harks back to ancient myth to cast music as the 
enchanting song of the sirens luring innocent sailors to their death. 
</P>
<P>
 A later French illumination of "The Consolations of Philosophy" by the Coetivy 
Master finds music dignified as among the mathematical disciplines. That seems 
right. Music is like math turned into sound. Like this art, its expressive 
value is not limited by size.

MUSIC REVIEW; YEVGENY KISSIN RECITAL: POETRY VS. MANNERISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Make no mistake. Yevgeny Kissin, the 22-year-old pianist from Moscow who 
returned to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on Sunday for a much-cheered recital 
of Schumann, Schubert and Liszt, commands the touch of a poet. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, it isn't always a light touch. 
</P>
<P>
 Kissin functions these days as the man of the hour and the flavor of the month 
-- maybe even the year -- among youthful heroes of the keyboard. Unlike so many 
faceless colleagues and rivals, however, he isn't content to make 10 virtuosic 
fingers work like 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, he can play loud and fast, louder and faster, maybe even loudest and 
fastest. He succumbs to playing in the cracks only when supreme agitation 
beckons. Even then, he does so pardonably, and in good historical company. 
Artur Rubinstein didn't always hit the right notes either. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kissin's art isn't a matter of technical wizardry. That's just the 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 He happens to be a thinker and an individualist. By nature, moreover, he would 
seem to be a bona fide old-fashioned romantic. That makes him something of an 
anachronism in the cool, impersonal light of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 He takes liberties. He stalls. He lingers. He toys with a line, pulls melodies 
apart. He makes the music sigh, whisper and whimper. He searches out inner 
voices, explores subtle nuances, focuses passing harmonies. He surges forward. 
He makes the music roar. He flashes explosive contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Kissin is an artist who takes chances. This should not imply that he indulges 
in a lot of personal emoting on the piano bench. The pianist stays calm and 
lets the composer do the gushing. 
</P>
<P>
 At best, he is illuminating, exciting, poignant. At worst, he is willful. 
Either way, he isn't boring. 
</P>
<P>
 At this stage of his already imposing and incredibly promising career, Kissin 
doesn't always seem to know when to stop. He doesn't invariably respect the 
precarious lines that separate invention from mannerism and definition from 
distortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does he observe careful stylistic distinctions. His Schumann is 
extraordinarily broad in scope and disarmingly dreamy in mood. So is his 
Schubert. So is his Liszt. Never mind that one composer's aesthetic was rooted 
in classicism, that the other dealt in gentle introspection, or that the third 
was a wildly uncontrolled extrovert. 
</P>
<P>
 Kissin was most persuasive when confronting the rambling indulgences of the 
wildly uncontrolled extrovert. At the end of the formal part of the program, he 
brought massive bravura and feverish excess to four of Liszt's "Transcendental 
Etudes." Kissin made an otherworldly journey of the chiming crescendo and 
decrescendo of "Harmonies du soir." He made the snow whirl with hypnotic 
delirium in "Chasse-neige," and mustered waves of wispy charm for "Feux 
follets." Finally, he banged his way to oppressive grandeur, untiring and 
virtually unfazed, in the wild chase of the "Wilde Jagd." 
</P>
<P>
 It was all too much, really, and in Lisztian context, just right. 
</P>
<P>
 The program had opened rather fussily, if sweetly, with Schumann's C-major 
"Arabesque," Opus 18. The same composer's C-major "Phantasie," Opus 17, offered 
more of the same, only with more exaggeration. Opening the second half of the 
program, Schubert's A-minor Sonata, D. 784, seemed to get looser and looser, 
just as one hoped it would get tighter and tighter. 
</P>
<P>
 The capacity audience loved everything, demonstratively and sometimes 
prematurely. It was rewarded with four generous encores: Gluck's hum-along 
"Melody" as transcribed by Giovanni Sgambati, a Liszt "Etude du concert" 
followed by yet another of his "Etudes d'execution transcendante" (No. 10 in 
F-minor), and, finally, Carl Tausig's reduction of Schubert's "Marche 
militaire."

 Berlin Fest: "In the Name of the Father," an Academy Award contender starring 
Daniel Day-Lewis as a man wrongly convicted for an IRA bombing, won the Golden 
Bear Award for best picture Monday at the Berlin International Film Festival. 
Tom Hanks, who is favored for an Oscar for his role as a gay lawyer with AIDS, 
earned best actor honors for "Philadelphia." Among other winners at the 44th 
annual festival, Krzysztof Kieslowski was named best director for "Three 
Colors: White," the second of a trilogy, and Crissy Rock took best actress 
honors her performance in "Ladybird, Ladybird," as a woman who fights the 
British bureaucracy to keep her family together. French director Alain Resnais 
was awarded a Silver Bear for outstanding single achievement for his twin 
films, "Smoking" and "No Smoking." TELEVISION

 Bomb Threat: A suspicious-looking box -- that turned out to be containing 
tennis shoes -- was detonated Monday at CBS Television City. The building was 
evacuated after a shoebox covered in tape was discovered at the artists' 
entrance. Production was halted on "The Young and the Restless," "The Bold and 
the Beautiful" and "The Price Is Right" as the casts of those shows emptied 
into the CBS parking lot. They were joined by the studio audience of "The Price 
Is Right," which had been told about the evacuation by the show's host, Bob 
Barker. The LAPD bomb squad had been called and took the threat seriously, one 
officer said, because Barker has been threatened because of his work with 
United Activists for Animal Rights. Just last week a bomb was found outside the 
home of one of Barker's Hollywood Hills neighbor, a deputy district attorney. 
At the time Barker wondered: "Did they get it in the right driveway?"

 Lawrence's Jokes Draw Complaints: NBC's censors deleted some portions of 
comedian Martin Lawrence's opening monologue this weekend on "Saturday Night

show was seen live in the East, the network logged at least 177 complaints from 
viewers about jokes on such topics as women's sexual cleanliness and John Wayne 
Bobbitt. Lawrence, who is currently appealing an NC-17 rating for his stand-up

It will be shown at 8 p.m. on March 19, two days before this year's Academy 
Awards, at which Steven Spielberg's version of the story, "Schindler's List," 
is favored to win several awards including best picture. The 90-minute

million pounds (about $7.4 million) on the show and will play the lead role of 
Heathcliff. "I'm not a likely choice for Heathcliff so it was never likely for 
(outside) producers to put money into it," he said. Tim Rice, former partner of 
Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, is writing the lyrics for the show, which is due to

JAZZ REVIEW; DAVE KOZ TAKES THE EASY COMMERCIAL PATH AT STRAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave Koz is the musical alter ego to pop saxmeister Kenny G. Where G is cute 
and hairy, Koz is square-jaw handsome and fashionably well trimmed; where G 
plays sweetly floating melodies, Koz's alto and soprano saxophone lines are 
dominated by funk-powered rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
 But where both performers are on the same track is in their unrelenting 
pursuit of audience approval -- regardless of the musical consequences.Koz's 
show at the Strand on Saturday night was a perfect case in point. Accompanied 
by an infectiously danceable groove laid down by his sterling four-piece backup 
band, the most Koz could add to the mix was an effusive series of solos based 
on simplistic, scale-driven melodies and blues-tinged effects. 
</P>
<P>
 No problem for his listeners -- or for Koz -- all of whom seemed far more 
fascinated with his theatrical posturing and occasional trips into the crowd 
(during one of which he simulated an erotic encounter with a willing female 
fan) than with any musical accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of his rare efforts to reach beyond commercial goals with a 
Koz-described "unplugged" trio -- guitar, keyboard and soprano sax -- all three 
were, in fact, plugged. A spontaneous improvisation, which, also according to 
Koz, "jazz players like to do," produced some random noodling and an eminently 
predictable blues chorus. But at least it confirmed that by stressing his 
dramatic, rather than his musical skills, Koz is doing what he does best. DON

 Points of View: Six youths from the Pico-Aliso Housing Projects in Boyle 
Heights have created a dramatic document of life in their community through an 
exhibition of photographs and video entitled "We Live Here!/Nosotros Vivimos 
Aqui!," at Santa Monica's Midnight Special Bookstore March 1-31, with an 
opening reception on March 3 at 7 p.m. sponsored by the Liberty Hill 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The photographic images, both dark and tender -- a young father cuddles his 
baby, a victim of gang violence is remembered -- are the culmination of an 
eight month project coordinated by media artist Pamela Cohen in conjunction 
with community-based organizations Proyecto Pastoral and Comite Pro Paz. Grace 
Campos, Joe Diaz, Becky Garcia, Larry Nguyen, Erica Parra and Johnny Saldana 
interviewed community members and took the more than 50 photographs in the show 
after being trained in black-and-white photography, video and interviewing 
techniques.

MUSIC REVIEW; BAIRD AND FISK SURVEY SPANISH SONGS AT UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps the combination of soprano and guitar and Spanish song sounds like an 
irresistible one, but Sunday night in Schoenberg Hall at UCLA, when soprano 
Julianne Baird joined guitarist Eliot Fisk for such a program, it didn't seem 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that these artists failed in dispatching the goods with a thorough 
professionalism and, even, enthusiasm. Just that the evening's pleasures turned 
out to be decidedly slight. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of factors contributed to this. For one thing, the range of the 19 
songs on the program -- by 16th- and 17th-Century composers Fuenllana, Mudarra, 
Hidalgo and Sances and 20th-Century Gerhard, Ginastera and Rodrigo -- was quite 
small. All were simple in style and direct in effect, based on Spanish folksong 
or dance idioms, and short. They did not so much resonate off one another as 
they did reiterate. 
</P>
<P>
 The absence of printed texts aided this impression, though the performers 
offered brief spoken synopses in compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Baird, whose expertise apparently centers around Baroque opera 
and sacred music, showed no special understanding of Spanish style. She sang 
these songs like a New Englander. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight of the concert became, then, Fisk's two solo interludes in 
pieces originally intended for keyboard. In four otherwise unidentified 
Scarlatti sonatas and in Albeniz's "Granada" and "Asturias," the Segovia 
protege revealed a technique both commanding and fluid, which allowed him to 
project the music with drive, when needed, and with textural clarity, ease and 
melodic focus. 
</P>
<P>
 Baird's soprano proved fluent, resourceful and evenly regulated, though 
somewhat dry in the softer dynamics. She phrased elegantly, ornamented 
delicately and took vocal leaps with grace and flair. Her pronunciation sounded 
square, however, and nowhere did she capture the perfume and spice, the 
sultriness and abandon under the surface of this music. 
</P>
<P>
 Her restraint worked best in Ginastera's sinister lullaby, "Arrorro," her 
virtuosity in the Rodrigo's bounding "De los alamos vengo." Fisk accompanied, 
mostly in his own transcriptions, with casual energy. TIMOTHY MANGAN

FORMER CSUF ADMINISTRATOR JACK PREBLE DIES; EDUCATION: PROFESSOR AND AUTHOR HAD 
RETIRED AS CHAIRMAN OF HIS DEPARTMENT AFTER 28 YEARS WITH THE UNIVERSITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kenneth J. (Jack) Preble, a venerable Cal State Fullerton educator and 
administrator, died Sunday of respiratory failure. He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
 Preble, a longtime Fullerton resident, joined the staff at Cal State Fullerton 
in 1963 as a professor of educational administration following a seven-year 
stint as an elementary and junior high school teacher and principal in 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 While at Fullerton, Preble moved through faculty ranks and became an 
administrator. By the time he retired in 1991, he was chairman of the 
department of educational administration at the School of Human Development and 
Community Service.  
</P>
<P>
 During his 28-year association with the university, Preble developed a variety 
of new courses and workshops, wrote numerous academic articles and co-authored 
two books on education administration for the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Preble's former students are school superintendents in Orange County, 
according to his widow, Jeanne. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her husband had worked hard to promote the advancement of female 
administrators in what had been a largely male-dominated field in the 1960s and 
'70s.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was one of the pioneers in pushing for women roles in administration," 
said Jeanne Preble, a therapist who advises the Orange County chapter of 
Parents of Murdered Children. 
</P>
<P>
 She said one of her husband's most rewarding endeavors at Cal State Fullerton 
was directing a program called Project Upward Bound, which helped gifted, 
underprivileged students earn college degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor health forced Preble to retire early, his widow said. But even during his 
retirement, he continued to do consulting work and became active in Orange 
County's Habitat for Humanity organization.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was a great man who believed so much in people," Jeanne Preble said. "It 
was a real gift that he had. I don't think he ever stopped teaching even when 
he was retired." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife, Preble is survived by daughters Deborah J. Hansen of 
Spokane, Wash., and Kimberley J. Voisan of West Covina, son John M. Preble of 
Murietta, Ga., and four grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitation will be Wednesday from 6 to 8 p.m. at McAulay & Wallace Mortuary, 
902 N. Harbor Blvd., Fullerton. The funeral will be at 11 a.m. Thursday at 
Valencia United Methodist Church, 2050 N. Valencia Ave., Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of flowers, the family has requested that donations be made in the 
name of Jack Preble at the Valencia United Methodist Church or to Habitat for 
Humanity of Orange County, P.O. Box 7086, Orange, Calif. 92613.

'94 WINTER LILLEHAMMER OLYMPICS; BLAIR'S BEST IN 1,500 NOT GOOD ENOUGH; 
SPEEDSKATING: SHE FINISHES 0.03 SECONDS SHORT OF A BRONZE, WHICH WOULD HAVE 
BEEN HER SIXTH MEDAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 1,500 meters, speedskater Bonnie Blair is a sprinter stretching out. It is 
not her distance, but she almost turned it into her sixth Olympic medal Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Supported by the Blair Bunch, her cheering section of friends and relatives, 
Blair skated her best time at the distance and missed the bronze by only 0.03 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would have been special, but I can't be disappointed," she said. "It was 
a real strong race for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing I wanted to do was skate a personal best because I had been so 
close all season, and to do it by over a half-second makes me real happy. I 
hadn't skated a personal best in six years." 
</P>
<P>
 Having won the 500 already, Blair is expected to win the 1,000 Wednesday for a 
fifth gold, breaking a tie with Evelyn Ashford, Janet Evans and Pat McCormick 
as the most victorious American female Olympian. 
</P>
<P>
 Her coach, Nick Thometz, was asked if the strong effort in the 1,500 might 
take a toll in the 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "For her to skate that strongly at 1,500 can only give her more confidence in 
the 1,000," he said. "She's skated a lot all season and always recovered well. 
She's very strong, physically and mentally." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first part of the race came so easily, and I felt so right technically, I 
have to feel it can only help me in the 1,000," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I died on the last lap, but that's a given. That always happens to me (in the 
1,500)." 
</P>
<P>
 Skating in the second pair, Blair did 2:03.44 compared to her previous career 
best of 2:03.92. 
</P>
<P>
 She was third, behind Emese Hunyady of Austria and Gunda Niemann of Germany, 
when Svetlana Fedotkina of Russia, skating in the ninth of 15 twosomes and 
benefiting from resurfaced ice, came in at 2:02.69, almost two seconds below 
her career best, bumping Blair to fourth and Niemann to third. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the way it ended, with Hunyady's 2:02.19 providing Austria with its 
first gold in speedskating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been so close and so strong in that race all season that I felt if I 
could skate a career best, I'd have an outside chance at a medal," Blair said. 
"I also knew with the resurfacing and the way the pairings were, Fedotkina was 
the only one who could bump me out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had my hopes up, but that's part of the game. Sometimes you're one of the 
first and sometimes one of the last. Sometimes you have to wait, and sometimes 
they have to wait on you." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair finished fourth in the 1988 Olympic 1,500, but her 1992 pace was so far 
off medal contention that Peter Mueller, her coach then, shut her down over the 
final 400 meters and she finished 21st in the rain at Albertville. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we made the right move," Thometz said of the decision to go hard. 
"She wanted to skate, and she skated outstandingly. She puts pressure on 
herself any time she goes against the clock, but she also knew she wasn't in 
the same position in this race that she is in the (500 and 1,000). 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her, 'Whatever you come up with is great,' and I think that took some 
pressure off. I mean, you can't look back and say, 'Well, we didn't win a 
medal, so it was a mistake.' " 
</P>
<P>
 No regrets from Blair or Thometz and apparently none from Niemann, who won the 
3,000 and 5,000 in '92 and was runner-up in the 1,500.  
</P>
<P>
 Given a shot at three golds here, the 27-year-old librarian has only the 5,000 
left in her last Olympics after falling in the 3,000 and skating cautiously on 
the early laps of the 1,500 because of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am doing my best," she said. "I can't be disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunyady, 27, is on a roll, having won the all-around world championship in 
Butte, Mont., in early February. 
</P>
<P>
 She was born in Budapest -- "I have the same name as a Hungarian king, but 
there's none of that in my family" -- and followed a coach to Vienna in her 
late teens. She was alone with no money and no job until going to work in the 
bank where she is still employed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a late start," she said of her competitive skating and desire to 
continue through 1998. "I can still be faster."

KINGS COLLAPSE AGAIN, LOSE FIFTH IN A ROW; HOCKEY: MCSORLEY'S SUSPENSION 
ANNOUNCED BEFORE GAME. THEN, MAPLE LEAFS SCORE FIVE IN THE THIRD PERIOD TO WIN, 
6-4.

<P>
 Wayne Gretzky showed up at the Forum early Monday afternoon and signed his new 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty McSorley showed up and learned he had been suspended for allegedly 
gouging the eye of a San Jose Shark last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the other Kings didn't show up at all. 
</P>
<P>
 At least not for the final 12 minutes of their game at the Forum against the 
Toronto Maple Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading by 3-1 in the final period, the Kings collapsed, surrendering four 
goals in 10 minutes and five in the period to tumble to their fifth consecutive 
defeat, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss drops the Kings to 21-32-6. Because San Jose also lost Monday, the 
Kings remain seven points behind the Sharks, holders of the eighth and final 
playoff spot in the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a team is struggling," said King Coach Barry Melrose, "nobody wants to 
be on the ice. When you're winning, everybody wants to be out there. We have a 
lot of guys who didn't want to be out there today. They are thinking 
negatively. They don't want to make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 It could have been a joyous day for Gretzky. He finally signed the three-year, 
$25.5-million contract that he agreed to in principle five months ago. In the 
interim, additional negotiations resulted in deferred money being moved up from 
15 years after the end of the contract to six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky celebrated by scoring his 29th and 30th goals of the season, giving 
him 795 in his career, six shy of Gordie Howe's NHL record total of 801. But 
there was no joy in Gretzky's locker stall after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "For two periods," he said, "we played like Stanley Cup finalists. But for 12 
minutes, we played without any confidence. I can't put my finger on it, but 
that explains our year -- one good period and one bad period, one good shift 
and one bad shift." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings are not only losing confidence and games, but bodies. They lost Tony 
Granato nearly two weeks ago for 15 games because of a slashing incident. 
</P>
<P>
 They lost McSorley for at least Monday after he had played only two games for 
the Kings since coming from the Pittsburgh Penguins in last week's big trade. 
</P>
<P>
 McSorley, who will get a hearing by phone today, is accused of gouging the eye 
of San Jose's Bob Errey at the end of last Saturday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the green light came on, signaling the end of the game, McSorley and 
Errey continued to battle in front of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of pushing and shoving," McSorley said, "but it's best I do 
not say anything until after the hearing." 
</P>
<P>
 This much is known: 
</P>
<P>
 When the scuffle was broken up, McSorley was assessed a minor penalty for 
roughing. He emerged from the struggle with blood streaming down from a cut 
over his left eye, a cut that required stitches to close. 
</P>
<P>
 Errey has a corneal abrasion and a bruise under one eye. 
</P>
<P>
 League officials assured the Kings that Errey would also not play Monday, but 
he wound up doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sharks sent the NHL office a tape of the incident. Upon viewing it Monday 
morning, Brian Burke, the league's director of hockey operations, saw enough to 
suspend McSorley pending today's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all their troubles, however, the Kings still enjoyed the early lead 
over Toronto, Central Division leaders with a 33-17-11 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Goals by the Kings' Alex Zhitnik, his 10th, and the Maple Leafs' Peter Zezel, 
his fourth, had left the score tied after one period. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Gretzky's goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Pearson scored his 11th goal with a 45-foot shot into the upper-left shelf 
of the net 7:49 into the final period. 
</P>
<P>
 Dmitri Mironov got his seventh on goalie Kelly Hrudey's stick side at 11:53. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Gilmour picked up his 22nd after Nikolai Borschevsky stole the puck from 
Darryl Sydor, Gilmour's goal coming at 14:43. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmour came back to add his 23rd and the 300th of his career at 17:47 after a 
giveaway by Zhitnik. 
</P>
<P>
 Luc Robitaille's team-leading 33rd goal made it closer, but Bill Berg then 
scored his sixth into an empty net to put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 And leave the Kings tumbling out of control.

'94 WINTER LILLEHAMMER OLYMPICS; TORVILL AND DEAN MUST FACE MUSIC AS RUSSIANS 
WIN; ICE DANCING: BRITISH ROUTINE DOESN'T GO OVER WITH JUDGES. GRITSCHUK AND 
PLATOV GET GOLD.

 The chill was so thick after the Winter Olympic ice dancing competition Monday 
night that it could have been cut with the blade of a skating boot, a sensation 
that had nothing to do with the temperature inside the Olympic Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian teams that finished first and second, gold medalists Oksana 
Gritschuk and Evgeny Platov and silver medalists Maia Usova and Alexandr 
Zhulin, acted as if they would rather have been standing anywhere but next to 
each other on the victory stand, while bronze medalists Jayne Torvill and 
Christopher Dean of Great Britain seemed equally displeased with their 
location. There are more smiles in Ingmar Bergman movies. 
</P>
<P>
 There certainly were few on the faces of the 6,000 spectators, who brought so 
many bouquets to throw onto the ice in appreciation of Torvill and Dean that 
every florist between here and Oslo can retire. The fans were audibly 
disappointed when only one judge agreed with their point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the nine judges preferred the rock-and-roll routine of Gritschuk and 
Platov, who were not particularly sold on it themselves. "I prefer blues," 
Gritschuk said when the program was presented to them by their coach, Natalia 
Linichuk. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the music suited Gritschuk, 22, and Platov, 26, because it allowed 
them to demonstrate that they are "young, fresh and talented." That did not 
necessarily separate them from Usova, 29, and Zhulin, 30, who won first-place 
marks from three judges, but it certainly did from Torvill, 36, and Dean, 35, 
who were returning to serious competition after 10 years as professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod Swallow fell during their routine and 
finished 15th out of 21 couples. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Torvill and Dean skated in the Winter Olympics was in 1984, when 
they won with a sultry free dance to Ravel's "Bolero" that earned perfect 
scores of 6.0 for artistic impression from all nine judges. They received one 
perfect score Monday night for artistic impression, from -- naturally -- the 
British judge, but the others apparently found their program, skated to "Let's 
Face the Music and Dance," derivative. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that it was derivative of their own prior work -- "Mack and Mabel" in 
1982, "Barnum" in '83 and the "West Side Story" that Dean choreographed for 
Isabelle and Paul Duchesnay in '92 -- counted for little. The free dance is 
supposed to be original. 
</P>
<P>
 Torvill and Dean came closer to duplicating their earlier magic in Sunday 
night's original dance, which vaulted them from third place after the 
compulsory dances to first. They skated the program "The History of Love," 
which was appropriate for Dean because his was on display for everyone to see 
and remark upon. 
</P>
<P>
 While he acted as if he were making love to Torvill on the ice, his 
girlfriend, former U.S. world champion Jill Trenary, was in the stands, and his 
ex-wife, Isabelle Duchesnay, was serving as a commentator for French 
television. Ooh-la-la . 
</P>
<P>
 But as titillating as that might be, the scandal in ice dancing occurred in 
1992 when Zhulin, who has been married to Usova since 1986, had an affair with 
Gritschuk. If Zhulin was attempting to keep it a secret from Usova, he must 
have been taking tips from Gary Hart. Gritschuk wore his wedding ring around 
her neck in the compulsory dances during the 1992 Winter Olympics in 
Albertville, France. 
</P>
<P>
 That upset Usova so much that Zhulin retrieved his ring, enabling them to 
concentrate on their dancing long enough to earn the bronze medal. Fourth were 
Gritschuk and Platov. 
</P>
<P>
 The truce did not last long. In the spring of '92, during a tour stop in Los 
Angeles, Usova reportedly spotted Gritschuk sipping a margarita at Spago, 
grabbed her by the hair and began beating her head against the top of the bar. 
A melee ensued. 
</P>
<P>
 Natalia Dubova, who coached both pairs in Lake Placid, N.Y., decided they 
needed to be separated by at least one ocean, sending Gritschuk home to Moscow. 
A short time later, Platov, whose wife was there, followed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love Maia very much," Dubova told "Blades on Ice" magazine last fall. "I 
bring her from Gorky when she was 9, and when I see the cry of Maia . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Observers say this story is far from concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oksana told me last year she is going to marry Alexandr Zhulin," said a 
Russian journalist, Yelena Vaitsekhovskaia. "I think her main aim is to make 
Maia nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 On the victory stand Monday night, Usova and Zhulin and Gritschuk and Platov 
hugged and kissed Torvill and Dean. But when it came time for the Russian teams 
to congratulate each other, all they could muster were polite handshakes that 
fooled no one.

THE NHL / LISA DILLMAN; MCSORLEY MIGHT END UP TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE FOR KINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So, what happened to the ticker-tape parade down Manchester and Prairie? 
</P>
<P>
 The return of defenseman Marty McSorley, heralded from Woodland Hills to 
Westwood as the sure-fire solution, has yet to jolt the Kings out of their 
deepening, soon-to-be 
</P>
<P>
 out-of-playoffs malaise. 
</P>
<P>
 McSorley struggled against the Philadelphia Flyers and San Jose, then found 
himself out of the lineup after a postgame skirmish with the Sharks' Bob Errey 
Saturday. McSorley is indefinitely suspended -- pending league review -- after 
San Jose claimed he gouged Errey's left eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, the Kings' problems are so significant they can't be solved with a 
single stroke. The Kings' roster looks better with McSorley than without, but 
it can be argued that something should have been done long ago -- before the 
Kings were five points out of a playoff spot with fewer than 30 games 
remaining. Now they are seven points behind the Sharks in the race for the 
final playoff berth in the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 If McSorley had been retained last summer, it wouldn't have cost them Tomas 
Sandstrom to get him back. Instead, Sandstrom could be used to fill another 
pressing need before the trading deadline -- a speedy center such as Corey 
Millen, or a goal-scoring defenseman, perhaps Paul Coffey.  
</P>
<P>
 Amid the excitement over McSorley's return, the team's mishandling of 
Sandstrom was overshadowed. Almost everyone involved -- management and coaches 
-- blew it. Once the decision was made not to re-sign Sandstrom, the Kings 
might have showed some foresight by trading him during the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Sandstrom had to listen to trade rumors all season from New York to 
Pittsburgh to St. Louis. He sulked a bit. Coach Barry Melrose benched him 
against Calgary in December. The move might have temporarily boosted the team, 
but it didn't help Sandstrom's psyche or his trade value. 
</P>
<P>
 Melrose seemed to forget that Sandstrom is not Jimmy Carson or Shawn 
McEachern. Sandstrom is a proven offensive producer who ranked among the Kings' 
top five in scoring at the time of the trade. Here, blame should be assigned to 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest problem with the Kings is that everyone is treating it like a 
hot potato and tossing it on down the line. HE IS FUNKY 
</P>
<P>
 It certainly says something when the Kings' best motivator this season has 
been Mighty Duck President Tony Tavares. By the way, where is Anthony 
(Bandwagon) Robbins these days? Maybe he can come in for a quick consultation 
-- that is, if Melrose can pry Robbins away from his new buddy, Prince.  
</P>
<P>
 Say, who's in a bigger slump, the Kings or Prince? 
</P>
<P>
 Little did Tavares know that Wayne Gretzky would take such great offense at 
his comments in The Times about Gretzky's success at working the officials. 
Incensed, Gretzky reeled off five points in a 5-3 victory over the Ducks in 
their most recent meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 However, almost everyone connected with the Kings knew how Gretzky would react 
against the Ducks. After all, they watched him do it against the Maple Leafs 
after some slight criticism from a columnist in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone writes about him in Timbuktu, he knows," Melrose said. "He doesn't 
make a big deal about it. But he knows it. And he doesn't forget -- he's like 
an elephant." BACK ON TRACK 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone knew Jim Schoenfeld had a good sense of humor. The evidence? His 
now-famous postgame line in the 1988 Stanley Cup playoffs to referee Don 
Koharski -- "Have another donut, you fat pig!" 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't a bad coach, either. But, alas, coaches have always been very 
disposable items in New Jersey. Schoenfeld later resurfaced in the broadcast 
booth with ESPN. If a coach wants to get back to the bench, the quickest route 
is to grab a microphone. Joining the cozy broadcasting world is almost like 
setting up a booth at NHL/NFL/NBA Career Day. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked. And now Schoenfeld has two duties staring him in the face as coach 
of the Washington Capitals: First, prod and poke the underachieving Capitals 
into some form of playoff success; second, help the Capital Gang develop some 
identity to reverse the trend of dwindling crowds at the US Air Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Capitals are 8-3-2 under Schoenfeld and are 5-1-2 since being beaten by 
Montreal earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenseman Kevin Hatcher said the team has been improving its play in the 
neutral zone. So far, the Capitals have seen the best of Schoenfeld, enhanced 
by winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what he expects out of us," Hatcher said. "He's the type of coach who 
will play whoever is playing well. Some coaches live and die with their best 
players. But some nights, if your best players aren't doing it, you've got to 
use the others.  
</P>
<P>
 "He obviously saw that the other night in St. Louis when he sat me and Calle 
(Johansson) for about five, six minutes in the third period." NOT IMPRESSED 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford Whaler goaltender Sean Burke wasn't sympathetic when Olympic 
speedskater Dan Jansen crashed and fell last week in the 500-meter race at 
Lillehammer -- before finally winning a gold medal in the 1,000 meters Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to say I've got mixed feelings," Burke told the Hartford Courant. 
"My wife was so nervous for him. She wanted him to win so badly. But after I 
saw him interviewed, I was totally turned off. I didn't think he displayed a 
professional attitude at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "His coach walked right away from the interview, and Jansen said, 'Everybody 
knows I'm the best.' Well, you're not the best. You didn't win. You didn't (do 
it) when the gold medal is on the line. It's a great story, but I thought he 
should have had a lot more dignity at the Olympics." NOT HIGH ON HYPE 
</P>
<P>
 Burke, a former Olympian for Team Canada, then turned his attention to the 
U.S. Olympic hockey team. The hype machine went into full gear at Albertville, 
France, in 1992, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Good Morning America' wanted them," he said. "Everybody did. They hadn't 
really won anything, and everybody was all over them. I think the hype ends up 
hurting the U.S. every Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tonya vs. Nancy: "I don't think there are more than a handful of athletes 
over there who give a damn, really. I've got to admit with all the hype, I want 
to watch figure skating now."

MORNING BRIEFING: HEY, AMERICANS IN NORWAY: IT'S REALLY, REALLY, REALLY COLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For many Americans, the big problem with the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, 
Norway, is the winter part. 
</P>
<P>
 The other day at the luge track, while Norwegians reveled on a sunny day, U.S. 
fans tried to keep their feet warm in 7-degree weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Lefebvre of Atlanta, where the Summer Games will be held in 1996, wore two 
layers of socks under felt-lined boots and stood on two foam pads. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had five pads, I would stand on five and my feet would probably still be 
cold," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacy and Jim Goddard of Denver, a bit more accustomed to cold weather, had 
foam sandals shaped like Viking ships strapped over their winter boots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kind of a Norwegian version of wooden shoes," Goddard said of the devices, 
courtesy of their Norwegian hosts. "In Norway, they look at the weather a 
little differently than we do. They sleep under huge down comforters with the 
windows wide open. I knew we were in trouble when we saw that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What Winter Olympic event was held only when the Games were in 
St. Moritz, Switzerland? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Young at heart: Right-hander Rick Sutcliffe, who won 17 games and was rookie 
of the year with the Dodgers in 1979, still thinks he can win in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 "My knee is (sound) again and I have the arm of a 32-year-old," Sutcliffe said 
after signing a minor league contract with the St. Louis Cardinals. "Money 
doesn't mean anything. I've earned $20 million and kept a bunch of it. I just 
want to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Sutcliffe, a 16-game winner for Baltimore in 1992, started last season 8-2, 
then suffered a knee injury and finished 10-10. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went six weeks without saying anything," he said. "I went 0-7. I'm not real 
smart, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance policies: The Cincinnati Reds are talking to Lloyd's of London about 
insuring their top players. The Reds collected in 1993, when pitchers John 
Smiley and Tom Browning were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Cincinnati Post, Chubb Insurance Company wrote the Reds a 
check for $1.7 million for the rest of Smiley's contract after it was 
determined that he needed surgery for an elbow injury last July. 
</P>
<P>
 They also collected more than $500,000 when Browning sat out the final two 
months because of a broken finger. 
</P>
<P>
 What they would probably prefer most is to have an insurance policy that would 
bring reliever Rob Dibble back to his best form. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No fireworks: After Kansas City acquired Vince Coleman, Royal Manager Hal 
McRae had some choice words for the speedy outfielder: 
</P>
<P>
 "On July 4, wherever we are, you are rooming with me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Victory parade: Emmitt Smith had something extra to celebrate last week -- the 
return of his beloved helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 The helmet was stolen during the Cowboys' 30-13 Super Bowl victory over the 
Buffalo Bills on Jan. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Even owner Jerry Jones helped in the search for the missing headgear, to no 
avail. But last Wednesday, Texas Stadium officials said a man called to say 
that although he didn't steal the helmet, he had it in his possession and 
wanted to get rid of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, it was returned, no questions asked. 
</P>

 Trivia answer: The skeleton, on the Cresta Run. The skeleton is a heavy sled 
that is ridden headfirst, and the event was held at St. Moritz in 1928 and '48.

NHL ROUNDUP; MODANO HAS HAT TRICK; SHARKS FALL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Modano scored three goals, including a tiebreaking goal in the third 
period that sparked the Dallas Stars to a 6-3 victory over the San Jose Sharks 
Monday at San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Modano's second career hat trick and the first this season for Dallas 
as the Stars extended their winning streak to seven consecutive games, which 
matches a franchise record. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the Stars faced the Sharks -- Feb. 6 at Dallas -- they lost, 
7-1. It was the Sharks' largest margin of victory in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 8, Montreal 7 -- Ron Tugnutt, acquired from the Ducks Sunday, 
replaced Montreal goaltender Patrick Roy at 1:05 of the second period. The 
Flyers led at the time, 6-4, on five power-play goals and one even strength. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadiens closed within 7-6 at 6:01 of the third on Patrice Brisebois' 
unassisted goal before Eric Lindros scored his second of the night 1:56 later. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal's John LeClair closed the scoring when he tipped in a shot with 2:46 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Brind'Amour, Brent Fedyk and Lindros each scored twice for the Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Rangers 4, Pittsburgh 3 -- Tony Amonte scored the game-winner eight 
seconds into overtime at New York. Amonte had gone 10 games without a goal, and 
this one was only his 14th, well behind the pace of the 35 and 33, 
respectively, he scored the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Islanders 4, Washington 0 -- Ron Hextall stopped 26 shots for his 
second consecutive shutout as the Islanders ended the Capitals' seven-game 
unbeaten streak by winning at Uniondale, N.Y.

NHL ROUNDUP; CANADIENS PUT TUGNUTT TO WORK

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Tugnutt won't likely forget his first game with the Montreal Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Canadiens' 8-7 loss to the Flyers at Philadelphia on Monday, Tugnutt, 
acquired from the Mighty Ducks on Sunday, replaced goalie Patrick Roy at 10:05 
of the second period and ended up with the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flyers led at the time, 6-4, on five power-play goals and one 
even-strength goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadiens closed within 7-6 at 6:01 of the third on Patrice Brisebois'

 Montreal's John LeClair closed the scoring when he tipped in a shot with 2:46

</P>
<P>
 It was Modano's second career hat trick and the first this season for Dallas

 The last time the Stars faced the Sharks -- Feb. 6 at Dallas -- they lost,

<P>
 New York Rangers 4, Pittsburgh 3 -- Tony Amonte scored the winner eight 
seconds into overtime at New York. Amonte had not scored a goal in 10 games, 
and this one was only his 14th, well behind the pace of 35 and 33 he scored the 
last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Islanders 4, Washington 0 -- Ron Hextall stopped 26 shots for his 
second consecutive shutout as the Islanders ended the Capitals' seven-game 
unbeaten streak at Uniondale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty McInnis had a goal and two assists, which helped Hextall raise his 
personal shutout string to 147 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's Mike Ridley, suffering from flu, ended a string of 274 games 
played. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo 2, Quebec 1 -- Yuri Khmylev scored the winning goal in the second 
period at Buffalo as the Sabres extended their unbeaten streak to four games.

<P>
 Losersville, U.S.A.: It is now unlikely that any of L.A.'s four NHL and NBA 
teams will accomplish the modest feat of reaching the playoffs. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Only the Mighty Ducks have an excuse. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Kings played the last period against Toronto as though they were looking 
ahead to tee time the day after the regular season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The victory Monday moved the United States into the medal round of the Olympic 
hockey tournament, but I will be a lot more impressed if we beat Italy in the 
World Cup soccer tournament this summer. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Someone named Snow -- American goaltender Garth -- ought to feel at home in 
the Winter Olympics. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Connection: Six former Olympians are on the Mighty Duck roster -- Tim 
Sweeney, Joe Sacco and Sean Hill of the United States, Patrik Carnback of 
Sweden, and Alexei Kasatonov and Anatoli Semenov of Russia. And a couple of 
Duck draft choices, Paul Kariya of Canada and Valeryi Karpov of Russia, are 
playing in Norway. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I would hate to see an NHL-dominated Olympic tournament in 1998 if for no 
other reason than that the league would have to close down for a couple of 
weeks. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I was sorry I had to miss the moose barbecue Sunday at the Hafjelltoppen press 
village. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If Purdue forward Glenn Robinson stays on top, it will be the first time since 
Pete Maravich in 1970 that the player generally considered to be the best in 
the nation is also the leading Division I scorer. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Trivia question: Who was the leading scorer last season? Answer: Greg Guy of 
Texas Pan American. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The only two local players to win the scoring championship were Hank Gathers 
in 1989 and Loyola Marymount teammate Bo Kimble in 1990. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Before the season, coaches were saying that as many as half the Pacific 10 
Conference teams would reach the NCAA Tournament. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Now it looks as though only three -- UCLA, Arizona and California -- will make 
it. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 USC practiced later than usual Monday morning because of the Presidents' Day 
holiday, so Coach George Raveling got to sleep in until 5 a.m. . . .  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 John Wooden, whose first UCLA national championship team of 1964 is 
celebrating its 30th anniversary, will speak at the monthly newsmakers' 
luncheon on March 8 at Anaheim Stadium. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Natalie Williams and Lisa Leslie demonstrated again Sunday that L.A. has the 
best two forwards in women's college basketball -- Williams getting 32 points 
and a Pac-10 record 25 rebounds against Arizona State, and Leslie 32 points, 12 
rebounds, six assists and three steals against Arizona. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 So-so: The Indiana Pacers, who were 164-164 the previous four seasons, are 
25-24 this season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A winner-take-all, 50-meter sprint duel between Irina Privalova and Gail 
Devers would spice up the Sunkist meet next year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Desormeaux is so confident that his mount Fly With Ty will be a 
heavyweight in the Kentucky Derby picture that he refers to the colt as "The 
Tyson."... 
</P>

COLLEGE BASKETBALL; UCLA DROPS TO NO. 15; ARKANSAS IS STILL NO. 1

<P>
 UCLA dropped from No. 8 to No. 15 in the Associated Press college basketball 
rankings, and for the first time since early January a team held the No. 1 spot 
for consecutive weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas, which was in the top spot for five weeks until the run of seven 
polls and seven different No. 1 teams, won both its games last week and 
overwhelmingly stayed No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two other schools held their place from last week's voting. Three teams 
dropped out of the top 25. There were 18 losses among the top 25 last week with 
Kansas, Louisville and Alabama Birmingham each dropping two games.

 No. 16 Florida 72, Florida State 61 -- Dan Cross made 10 of 11 free throws and 
had 12 points in the final six minutes to lead the Gators at Gainesville. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross had been held in check for much of the game by Florida State's Chuck 
Graham, scoring only four points in the first 34 minutes. But after Graham 
fouled out with 2:05 left, Cross scored seven points in the next minute and a 
half to secure the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida (22-4) held the Seminoles to 28% (nine for 32) field-goal shooting in 
the second half. The Seminoles made only four field goals in the final 8:18 and

WIDE-OPEN SPACES SUIT LONG BEACH STATE, 80-58 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most memorable thing about Monday night's nonconference basketball game 
between Long Beach State and Memphis, was not so much that it was the first 
college basketball game ever played in the Anaheim Arena, or the fact that Long 
Beach won, 80-58. 
</P>
<P>
 The event was a calculated effort by Long Beach officials to stake a claim in 
neighboring Orange County, where it's estimated that as much as half of the 
school's 100,000 graduates reside. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by the results, the attempt was a success. More than 500 invited 
guests showed up for an all-Orange County pregame alumni reception in a room 
that could hold only 250. And on the court, the 49ers, who have run hot and 
cold, got off to their best start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 With guard Jeff Rogers contributing five points and a key assist early in the 
run, the 49ers raced to a 31-9 lead. Reserve forward Jauquin Hawkins added 
three lay-ins, forward Rod Hannibal had a three-pointer and reserve guard 
Tyrone Mays picked up five points during the streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the former Memphis State, playing its first game since the 
Tennessee legislature approved the name change, could make only three of eight 
field goal attempts.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was the behind-the-scenes interest in this game that made it so 
intriguing. After years of frustrated attempts at building name recognition in 
greater L.A., Long Beach targeted about 10 western Orange County cities, a 
quarter of a mile inside the Orange Curtain from from its Eastside location, 
with a weeklong media blitz on local cable television systems and in newspaper 
advertisements. Officials reasoned that, with their own new gymnasium scheduled 
to open in time for next season, the Orange County market, only a quarter of a 
mile away from campus, is too lucrative to pass up any longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a good chance for us to get some exposure in the county," said 
interim athletic director Dave O'Brien, a resident of Seal Beach. "We felt this 
would be an opportunity to play in what really is our back yard and that by 
having a good showing, people here will get involved with Long Beach State." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien said Long Beach, which keeps half of all net proceeds from Monday's 
game, might play as many as two games a years in county facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 That would seem to fit the 49er basketball team just fine. Whether it was the 
partisan crowd, which sounded louder than announced, or merely the opportunity 
to play a home game somewhere else than its cramped 1,900-seat campus gym, Long 
Beach excelled before 8,305.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; FIRST FULL-SQUAD WORKOUT TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 First baseman Eric Karros showed up briefly Monday at Dodgertown in Vero 
Beach, Fla., even though he is unsigned to a 1994 contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Karros, along with the other position players, is expected to report today 
when the first full-squad workout is held. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger executive Fred Claire is working on signing Karros and shortstop Jose 
Offerman to multiyear contracts, which could avoid a couple of years of 
arbitration for both players. It's a change in policy for the Dodgers, who 
until catcher Mike Piazza's recent signing did not offer players with fewer 
than four years' service multiyear contracts. This is the third season for both 
Karros and Offerman. Piazza signed a three-year, $4.2-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get into an arbitration year and you have some unknowns there," said 
Claire, who has set March 3 as the final day for the club to either sign a 
player or renew their contracts. Karros made $435,000 last season, Offerman 
$300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm confident this will be worked out," Karros said. 
</P>

 Todd Worrell, who looked effective while throwing batting practice, said his 
arm feels as good as it has since he had shoulder surgery after the 1989 
season. "I plan to be in the first game of the spring this year rather than not 
pitch until the last week," said Worrell, who pitched only 4 2/3 innings last 
spring because of injuries. "I have a lot less on my mind this season. When you 
are hurt, your mind is occupied with your condition, and it almost becomes a 
distraction. This spring, I'm in a good frame of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time in four seasons that Cory Snyder is returning to the 
same club for spring training, and he feels good about that. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know people and where things are, and it makes it so much easier," said 
Snyder, who has played for different clubs in the past five seasons. "When I 
left after last season, I thought that I was the Dodger right fielder, and I'm 
going to go back this season and do the same thing. I have no control over it, 
but I think they know that I can do it from what I did last season." 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder batted .266 in 143 games with 33 doubles, 11 home runs and 56 runs 
batted in, but struck out 147 times. The next highest was 88 strikeouts by Eric 
Davis. Snyder's competition this spring will come primarily from Raul Mondesi.

 Pitcher Ramon Martinez, the only no-show so far in camp, arrived in Miami on 
Monday and is expected to be at the workout today. . . . Darren Dreifort threw 
again and impressed pitching coach Ron Perranoski with his fastball and

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; PEREZ SAYS ELBOW IS FEELING FINE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even when you are the son of Tony Perez, there iss nothing like the euphoria 
of your first major league spring-training camp as a player. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is unbelievable, I'm still trying to get over it," said Eduardo Perez, 
who's expected to be the Angels' opening day left fielder."I tell people I'm 
just glad to be here, and they think I'm joking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seriously, I can't describe how good this feels." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, who will wear his father's No. 24 this season, wondered a month ago if 
he would make it to camp. He was training in Miami when his right elbow 
suddenly stiffened. He feared something was dreadfully wrong, but X-rays 
revealed no ligament damage. Instead, he had inflammation of the elbow, which 
sidelined him the final few days of the 1993 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was worried for a while," Perez said, "but I've been rehabbing so much that 
nothing was going to keep me back. I'm here now, and there's nothing in the 
world like it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is better than I ever could imagine." 
</P>

 The Angels will be unable to reconstruct the 2,500 seats at Anaheim Stadium 
that were damaged in last month's earthquake by opening day, according to Kevin 
Uhlich, Angel assistant vice president. However, he remains optimistic that 
they will have a temporary scoreboard in place. BOB NIGHTENGALE

 Michael Jordan listened to some advice from Chicago White Sox teammate Frank 
Thomas, then finally hit a ball over the fence on his last swing of batting 
practice. It was the first time since camp began a week ago that the 6-foot-6 
Jordan had cleared the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan was asked if hitting a homer compared to making a three-pointer in 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something like that," he said. "But I can hit a three-pointer. And quite 
often."

 Jordan will face live pitching from major leaguers for the first time today.

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: OFFICIALLY, HALF-HOUR WAIT WAS TOO LONG 
</P>

 Instead of a player or coach losing his cool, it was the officials who grew 
impatient before the start of a boys' high school basketball game last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section playoff game between Kern Valley of Lake Isabella and 
Verbum Dei was scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m. at Compton College. But by 8, 
there was no sign of Kern Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Unwilling to wait any longer, the officials decided to leave, and told Verbum 
Dei administrators the game would go down as a forfeit. Kern Valley showed up 
10 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Kearney, Verbum Dei's coach, said there was a miscommunication between 
the schools. Kern Valley thought the game was to be played on Verbum Dei's 
campus in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they got to Verbum Dei, there was no one there," Kearney said. "They 
called The Times and were told to go to Compton College. There was definitely 
some heated discussion when they finally arrived." 
</P>
<P>
 Kearney said two fans in attendance also did officiating and they went home to 
get their uniforms. Some other officials working a high school game at nearby 
Gardena Serra also stopped by. Uncertain of what to do, however, the schools 
decided to try and reschedule the first-round game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that the officials should have waited for at least an 
hour," said Dean Crowley, Southern Section commissioner. "I've officiated a lot 
of games over the years, and I would never leave after just a half-hour." 
</P>
<P>
 Kern Valley is located near the Sequoia National Forest, 40 miles northeast of 
Bakersfield. The school was not excited about making another three-hour trip 
for nothing, so as a compromise the makeup game will be played tonight at Arvin 
High outside Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 In one nightmarish week last December, Coach Brian Breslin of Bellflower St. 
John Bosco thought that a promising boys' basketball season had quickly passed 
by with the loss of three key players. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems started on a Monday morning when Schea Cotton, a starting guard, 
told Breslin he was transferring to Santa Ana Mater Dei. Cotton is considered 
one of the area's top prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that day, Joe Samson, a sophomore forward and the team's top reserve, 
suffered a stress fracture in his left foot and was sidelined indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Eddie Ramirez, a starting guard, suffered a separated shoulder in a 
tournament game against Tustin later that week and was declared sidelined for 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost three of our top six players in four days," said Breslin, in his 
third year at the school. "Physically, we were really hurting, and emotionally 
the kids were drained. The Cotton transfer hurt the most. The team felt 
betrayed because they thought a player who started the season should stick it 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Breslin's worst fears proved unfounded, however. His top player, senior Jelani 
Gardner, was moved from guard to small forward and he responded by averaging 
nearly 30 points. The Braves also benefited from the transfer of sophomore 
forward Brian Johnson, who moved from Long Beach St. Anthony. Samson also 
recently returned from his injury. 
</P>
<P>
 St. John Bosco, 22-2 last season, is 24-2 after a first-round playoff victory 
over West Torrance in II-A, and plays La Mirada tonight at Biola College. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of anger for a while," Breslin said. "But we shuffled things 
around and made changes. Once the kids got used to our new system and kept 
winning, they were happy." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Southland's top boys' and girls' basketball teams should spend less time 
worrying about rankings and more time concentrating on sportsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopsided scores are becoming more routine as national polls continue to 
increase in popularity. Last week's results were further proof. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei's boys defeated Irvine, 94-45, and El Monte Arroyo, 90-39, in 
playoff games. Crenshaw's 118-80 victory over Dorsey marked the 11th time this 
season the Cougars have scored more than 100 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda's girls opened the playoffs with a 90-36 victory over Fullerton, 
while Lynwood defeated Santa Monica, 84-4. 
</P>
<P>
 All four winners are ranked by USA Today. Coaches for each team will claim 
that they cleared the bench and tried to keep the score down, but they are not 
doing enough. If they anticipate a rout, they should bring up some junior 
varsity players. They should call off the press early and go into a delay game 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no need for margins of 60, 70 or 80 points or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Another example is the St. Bernard girls, who are coming off a 106-16 victory 
over Cerritos Whitney Friday. They led, 37-0, after the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not what high school basketball is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
 There were few surprises in the opening week of the Southern Section 
basketball playoffs; all of the top-seeded teams survived. Newhall Hart's boys, 
seeded second in Division I-A, lost to Palmdale, 65-59, Saturday. Two No. 
2-seeded girls' team also lost. In I-A, Oxnard Channel Islands was upset by 
Cerritos, 55-52, and Newbury Park surprised Inglewood Morningside, 42-32, in 
III-AA. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of student unrest on the Paramount campus last Friday, the school had 
to call off a boys' soccer playoff game against Los Alamitos. The game was 
moved to Los Alamitos on Saturday morning, and Paramount won, 2-0. The Pirates 
will play at Mission Viejo Capistrano Valley today. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey Strand, a senior at Pleasant Hill College Park High in Northern 
California, set a national wrestling record Saturday for most victories in a 
career. His 19-4 technical fall victory over Ken Lawson of Clayton Valley in 
the 189-pound final of a league tournament gave him 218. That broke the record 
of 217 set by Matthew Brady of Kearsley High in Flint, Mich., in 1988-91. 
Strand is 53-0 this season. The State tournament is March 4-5 at University of 
Pacific in Stockton. Times' Top 20 Basketball Polls

COLLEGE DIVISION / ARA NAJARIAN: REDLANDS ENDS CLAREMONT-MUDD DOMINANCE

 Mike Sutton might have taught Tom Whittemore too well. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutton, the director of aquatics programs at Claremont-Mudd, created a 
Division III dynasty of sorts in Southern California. Whittemore swam on and 
later helped coach some of those teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering this school year, his men's swimming program had won 12 consecutive 
Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Assn. titles and his water polo 
teams had won conference titles from 1982 to '92. 
</P>
<P>
 And although Whittemore might not have been his best swimmer, he certainly was 
his best pupil. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittemore, now director of aquatic programs at Redlands, is bringing down the 
dynasty he helped build.  
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, his Redlands men's team won the SCIAC swimming championship to end 
the Stags' long reign. Last November, Whittemore's water polo team ended 
Claremont-Mudd's 10-year dominance by winning the SCIAC title. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't expect Whittemore to weep because he isn't Claremont-Mudd's favored 
son.  
</P>
<P>
 "Actually it makes it a little more special," Whittemore said. "Mike has been 
my mentor all along -- not just at the start -- but also when our programs got 
to a closer level (in competition). He always has good advice." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's too good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should have given him a lot of disinformation," Sutton said with a laugh. 
"He's gone way beyond what he learned here. It's not like he's an understudy -- 
we're equals. I'm proud of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Redlands was led by three sophomores who won two individual events each: Matt 
Ballard (400-yard individual medley and 200 butterfly), Greg Milton (50 and 100 
freestyle) and Matt Carpenter (100 and 200 breaststroke). 
</P>
<P>
 But Sutton and Whittemore agree that it was Redlands' depth that produced the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference between last year and this year is that last year, we were 
pretty even among our top swimmers, but Claremont had more depth," Whittemore 
said. "This year, we had more guys scoring in the seventh place through 12th." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Redlands was a heavy favorite, Whittemore said he was nervous on the 
first night of the three-day meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was wound up," he said. "After the morning session, I tried to figure out 
what the points would be from the prelims and I thought we would be down by 30 
after the first day. But I counted wrong, and we were only down by a point 
after the first day. That made me feel better because I knew we would be better 
on the second and third days. But I was an economics major; I should know how 
to count."  
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to SCIAC swimming titles, he can start counting at one. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Redlands' Gary Smith has been named to the 1994 U.S. Olympic Festival men's 
basketball coaching staff, as an assistant to Tom Asbury of Pepperdine on the 
West squad. Smith has been coaching at Redlands, his alma mater, for 23 years 
and won his 300th game earlier this season. His record is 307-286. 
</P>
<P>
 Redlands is 10-13 overall, 5-7 in SCIAC games, and has scored the highest 
point total (138) in a Division III game this season. Smith runs a wide-open 
offense -- similar to the one Paul Westhead made famous at Loyola Marymount -- 
and Redlands is second in Division III in team scoring with an average of 103.7 
points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 In 13 of the last 20 seasons, Smith's teams have finished either first or 
second in the SCIAC. Redlands won conference titles in 1976, '82 and '85. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympic Festival will held July 1-10 in St. Louis, with the men's 
basketball games on July 2-5.  
</P>

<P>
 Cal State San Bernardino's 74-67 defeat of Cal Poly Pomona in women's 
basketball a couple of weeks ago might have been the biggest victory in the 
program's history. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time the Coyotes had beaten Pomona, which has dominated the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. by winning every title since play started 
13 years ago. It was only the seventh conference loss ever for Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory pulled San Bernardino into a first-place tie with Pomona at 7-1. 
</P>
<P>
 If the teams tie for the CCAA championship, a coin flip will determine which 
school will play host to the semifinals of the CCAA tournament on March 2. The 
CCAA final will be played at the top-seeded school of the men's tournament on 
March 4. 
</P>

 College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Azusa Pacific is the first school to win consecutive Golden State Athletic 
Conference men's basketball titles. Azusa Pacific (25-3), which clinched the 
title with a 115-93 victory over Point Loma Nazarene on Tuesday, has won a 
school-record 27 games in a row at home and is No. 5 in the NAIA poll. . . . 
Christina Evans set a Cal Baptist school record by making eight three-point 
shots against The Master's on Feb. 6. Evans had 28 points and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Riverside center fielder Brett O'Dea did not hit a home run last season, 
but he hit three in three days recently. He had two solo homers, one a 
game-winner in the bottom of the 10th inning, in a 3-2 victory over Southern 
California College. Two days later, he hit a three-run homer in a 6-2 victory 
over UC Davis. . . .The NAIA approved Cal Baptist's request to make this a 
redshirt season for center Keith Greeley. He sprained his ankle in the season 
opener, but cut his hand when he punched out a window after a loss in his first 
game back. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Poly San Luis Obispo will play host to the Pacific 10 Conference wrestling 
championships Saturday and Sunday. . . . Cal State San Bernardino will hold a 
golf tournament next Monday at Arrowhead Country Club that will feature some of 
the best college golf programs from Division I -- USC, Long Beach State, Cal 
State Northridge, Loyola Marymount, San Diego State, San Diego, UC Irvine and 
San Bernardino. Admission is free. Details: (909) 880-5012.

'94 WINTER LILLEHAMMER OLYMPICS; EUROPEAN SWEEP HELPS RESTORE ORDER IN THE 
MOUNTAINS; ALPINE SKIING: SWEDEN'S WIBERG WINS GOLD MEDAL IN COMBINED WITH 
STRONG SLALOM RUNS. A SWISS WINS THE SILVER, A SLOVENIAN THE BRONZE AS U.S. IS 
FINALLY SHUT OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 No one expected American skiers to win a medal in every event, right? Get the 
Swiss more steamed than they are? 
</P>
<P>
 Why not toss Sweden a bone? 
</P>
<P>
 American Alpine excellence made a nice run on the world stage last week, but 
everyone knows all gold things come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 Skewered after watching the U.S. collect medals in the first four Olympic 
Alpine events, the Euros stepped up to the gates Monday and announced their 
presence, sweeping the women's combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg took the gold at the Hafjell course, defeating Swiss 
veteran Vreni Schneider by a total of 0.13 seconds in the two-day event, which 
combines the times of a downhill and two slalom runs. Alenka Dovzan of Slovenia 
took the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
 Picabo Street, second after Sunday's combined downhill, finished 10th overall, 
not a surprise given her lack of slalom experience. 
</P>
<P>
 But during the U.S. streak, nothing seemed impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 After Street's "disappointment," U.S. ski team surgeon Richard Steadman told 
Paul Major, the Alpine director, "Greed is a very ugly thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Europe broke through with a series of firsts: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wiberg, a 23-year-old pop singer and former mail carrier, earned the first 
Alpine medal for Sweden before a crowd that included her country's King Carl 
XVI Gustav and Queen Silvia. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she did not face "off-with-her-head" pressure, Wiberg was relieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to have them here," she said. "I like them very much. It's a fine 
king and queen we have." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Schneider, 29, ended Switzerland's exasperating dry spell, no Olympic 
medals dating 12 events to the Albertville Games. Schneider was a double 
gold-medal winner, in slalom and giant slalom, at Calgary in 1988, when the 
Swiss won 10 Alpine medals. 
</P>
<P>
 Questioned about a mistake that might have cost her the gold in her first run 
of slalom, Schneider responded politely, "I did not lose the gold, I won the 
silver." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dovzan, who turned 18 on Feb, 11, earned the first Olympic medal for 
Slovenia since it gained independence from former Yugoslavia in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Dovzan was not prepared to tackle the political significance of her bronze. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a big Olympic medal for Slovenia," she said. "We are a little 
state, 2 million, it means a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Street, still basking in the glow of Olympic silver, didn't stand much of a 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew this was how it was going to wind up and I just wanted to go out and 
ski a good race for myself and smile and have a good time," she said. "I hope 
the rules change back so that they're not so favorable for the slaloms in 
combined for the next Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent rule change, intended to simplify combined scoring, has given slalom 
specialists a marked advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the top three finishers in the downhill combined -- German's Katja 
Seizinger, Street and Isolde Kostner of Italy -- were no factor in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Seizinger and Kostner missed gates and were disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the old format, Street thinks she might have earned a medal. That 
complicated system handicapped the race to consider the vast difference between 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, a racer who had a one-second lead after downhill was likely to be 
granted an additional second before the slalom, in which a skilled technician 
can quickly make up lost downhill time. 
</P>
<P>
 The old system was more equitable, yet few could understand it. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the change? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's done like in every other sport," Major said. "They get a bunch of guys 
in a room, guys who have been around for a while and know all the answers. And 
they come up with some weird stuff. I like the old style. I think it's great 
for the public to see the times, but there's got to be some sort of compromise 
between times in weighing the downhill vs. the slalom event." 
</P>
<P>
 Using the old system for last year's World Championships at Morioka, Japan, 
Street won the downhill, placed 15th in slalom, and won the silver in combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, Street placed second in downhill, 10th in the slalom and 10th overall. 
Major said he intends to calculate Street's Olympic numbers under the old 
formula to see where she would have placed. 
</P>
<P>
 That won't be any time this week, though, because Major left the formula at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympic combined became a foregone conclusion when slalom specialists 
Wiberg, Schneider and Dovzan finished within 1.63 seconds behind Seizinger in 
Sunday's downhill portion. 
</P>
<P>
 Seizinger went out on her first slalom run, but the slalom specialists might 
well have made up the time difference on the first run anyway, with another run 
to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 In the morning run, Wiberg edged Schneider by 0.40 seconds and that, figured 
with her downhill time, gave her a 0.61 differential with the afternoon run 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider, winner of five World Cup slaloms this season, could not make up the 
difference on Wiberg, the defending Olympic GS gold medalist, in the second 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider, who skied before Wiberg on the second run, gave it her all, besting 
Wiberg handily -- 46.63 to 47.11 -- but she had too much ground to make up. 
</P>
<P>
 And who might Wiberg thank for her victory? 
</P>
<P>
 Would you believe Picabo Street? 
</P>
<P>
 The American has been teaching Wiberg the finer points of downhill. Maybe 
Street can exchange them for some slalom lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Street, with a medal in the bag, was rooting for Wiberg, who has returned to 
top form after sitting out much of last season because of a torn Achilles' 
tendon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw her before the second run today and I said, 'It's all you, girl,' " 
Street said. "You've got it. Don't just beat 'em, work 'em.' She came back from 
a really, really nasty injury last year to just clean everybody's clock all 
year."

U.S. GOES TO NEXT LEVEL, 7-1; HOCKEY: THEY HAVE NO TROUBLE AGAINST ITALY. 
UNBEATEN FINLAND IS QUARTERFINAL OPPONENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For inspiration, they watched a tape of Dan Jansen overcoming a frustrating 
Olympic past to win the gold medal in the 1,000-meter speedskating race last 
Friday. For incentive, they were reminded that a loss to Italy on Monday would 
end their Olympic medal chances and stamp them as the only U.S. hockey team to 
go winless at the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 And in case that wasn't enough to get them going, they had a target who was 
too nervous to press his pads together. 
</P>
<P>
 Three goals in less than nine minutes, two of them long shots through the legs 
of Massachusetts-born goaltender David Delfino, launched the United States to a 
7-1 mauling of Italy at Haakon Hall and into the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans' 1-3-1 record and fourth-place finish in Group B set up a 
matchup Wednesday against Finland, which scored 25 goals and gave up only four 
in rampaging through Group A to a 5-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it seems a mismatch, Delfino isn't counting the United States out, 
not after seeing what its determination can bring about. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came out hard. We had to be prepared and I guess we weren't. Maybe I 
psyched myself out a little," said Delfino, who grew up with U.S. center David 
Sacco and played in summer leagues with other American Olympians. "I'm not 
saying we would have won the game, but at least it could have been respectable. 
. . . Their work ethic is great and they never give up. I think they have a 
good shot at a medal." 
</P>
<P>
 He had no shot Monday against a team that found his weak spot -- along with 
the motivation it had lacked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt kind of bad for him," said Sacco, who banked a shot off Delfino for 
the third goal, the last before the starting goalie was replaced by Bruno 
Campese. "I wish he'd had a better game, but he could have stood on his head 
and beat us, too, and I wouldn't have liked that. . . . We needed a win to stay 
alive, and that's all I knew." 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that, however, might not have been enough. To strengthen the team's 
fluttery emotional pulse, strength and conditioning coach Jack Blatherwick 
assembled a tape of Jansen's world-record performance and showed it to the 
players during a team meeting Sunday. The message hit home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The true courage he had, an unbelievable athlete who conquered everything in 
his sport except a gold medal and then in his last race won it and set a world 
record, well, I wasn't really crying, but it was a pretty emotional moment," 
Sacco said. "The sentiments were, whatever you want to do, you can accomplish 
it if you believe, and this team believes in itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Said U.S. goalie Garth Snow: "It showed a guy who's faced a lot of adversity 
and who's really excelled over adversity. It seems like he's kept a really good 
attitude through it all. It was really inspirational." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Ciavaglia began the rout Monday with a blast from the right circle at 
1:50, and Peter Ferraro kept it going at 3:59 with the first of his two goals. 
After Sacco's power-play goal sent Delfino to the bench, the scoring resumed 
against Campese at 13:03 on a wrist shot by David Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Rolston, celebrating his 21st birthday, also scored twice as each of the 
four U.S. lines contributed at least one goal. Rolston has scored in four of 
the five games here and shares the tournament goal-scoring lead with Slovakia's 
Miroslav Satan at seven each. 
</P>
<P>
 In their only pre-Olympic meeting, the United States defeated Finland, 6-2, on 
Dec. 16 at the Izvestia Cup tournament in Moscow. Since then, however, both 
teams have changed their rosters, and Finland is challenging for its first gold 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Coach Tim Taylor said the Finns, "had a marvelous tournament . . . (but) 
our players will play with determination and confidence. You can't go in with 
the fear to fail." 
</P>
<P>
 They succeeded in fine fashion Monday. "Technically, we needed a tie to get 
in, but if we had come in tonight and tied the game, I don't think our psyche 
would have been in good shape," Ciavaglia said. "I don't think we could have 
designed anything better for a situation when everything's riding on one game." 
</P>
<P>
 Their hopes now ride on Wednesday's single-elimination game. "Right now, 
everyone's 0-0-0, and we're pretty positive going into the medal round," said 
Snow, who is sure to start in goal. "We're Americans and we're not going to go 
in there afraid. We're going in with a lot of confidence. We can play with 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Canadian goaltender Corey Hirsch couldn't help admiring Sweden's precise and 
uncanny passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be mesmerizing," he said. "But you can't let them do it to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Hirsch and his teammates didn't let Sweden get away with much, recording a 3-2 
victory that earned them a second-place finish in Group B. Hirsch faced 36 
shots, including 17 in the first period, as Canada (3-1-1) and seeded fourth, 
moved on to a medal-round matchup against the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 In losing, Sweden (3-1-1) missed a chance to win the group title and instead 
dropped to third, setting up a quarterfinal matchup against Germany on 
Wednesday. Slovakia beat France, 6-2, and finished first in Group B with a 
3-0-2 record.

'94 WINTER LILLEHAMMER OLYMPICS; AERIAL SKIING; WHILE U.S. MEN GO UP, WOMEN 
COME DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Aerial skiing is as American as the Fourth of July, so probably it should come 
as no surprise that all three American men entered made the field of 12 for 
Thursday's finals in Monday's elimination round. 
</P>
<P>
 But surprising it is, because only two of the U.S. skiers, Trace Worthington 
-- the favorite -- and Kris Fedderson, were considered strong bets. Eric 
Bergoust was given only an outside chance. A chance is a chance, though, and he 
made the most of his, picking off the last spot in the field by 1.56 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The American women were equally surprising, but for a different reason. Tracy 
Evans, who had competed in the morning with the B group, qualified eighth. But 
neither of the leading lights, Nikki Stone and Kristean Porter, made it. Stone, 
the leader after the first jump, botched the landing on her second and fell to 
13th, missing the finals by one position. Porter landed face-first on her 
second jump, cutting her chin and nose, and finished a distant 20th. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerial skiing is making its debut as a medal sport here. The competitive 
outgrowth of old-time hotdog skiing, it combines elements of gymnastics and 
diving, the skier launching high into the air off a steep snow ramp and 
performing somersaults, flips and twists while in the air. Judges assess the 
takeoff, height, distance, execution and landing. 
</P>
<P>
 Worthington, known as Trace the Ace, aced his first jump, a triple flip with 
four twists, then nearly sat down on the landing of his second, a double flip 
with three twists, and finished behind surprising leader Alexei Parfenkov of 
Belarus and Canadians Philippe LaRoche and Lloyd Langlois. 
</P>
<P>
 Two skiers seen as strong contenders, Christian Rijavec of Austria and 
Sebastian Foucras of France, failed to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy," Worthington said. "I've had bad practices the last few days and I 
was kind of worried this morning. But I did the hard jump first and I nailed 
it. That meant all I had to do was something halfway decent on the second and 
I'd make the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll do the same jumps Thursday, but I'll do 'em better." 
</P>
<P>
 Worthington said he had no problem with qualifying fourth. The scores don't 
carry over into the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not such a great thing to be sitting first going into the finals," he 
said. "There is some pressure there. I like where I'm sitting." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergoust was excited about qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cut it close today," he said. "It's been my dream, ever since I saw the 
sport, to just compete. To make the Olympic finals is fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
 Australian Kirstie Marshall, with two solid jumps, is the surprise leader 
among the women. She moved ahead on her second jump, then stayed there when 
Stone fell after a shaky landing. Hilde Synnove Lid of Norway, the Group B 
leader, is second and Marie Lindgren of Sweden third. 
</P>
<P>
 "I crashed," Stone said. "I had too much speed and I crashed on my landing. 
I'm disappointed it was after my second jump, but it's my first Olympics and 
I'm just trying to have fun here. I'll be back."

 The head of the Russian figure skating team called some of the judging here 
"crazy" and asked the republics of the former Soviet Union to return to 
"civilized relations." 
</P>
<P>
 Singling out the Ukrainian judging, Valentin Sych said the political tensions 
between the countries were reflected in the scoring of Russia's skaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The psychological situation is such that if a Swede wins, that is perfectly 
all right," Sych said. "But if a Russian wins, then the Ukrainian says, 'Well, 
it's a Russian.' 
</P>
<P>
 "That seems to be a typical reaction from the former republics."

 Before he quits international hockey, Sweden's Mats Naslund has one goal left: 
winning an Olympic gold medal and becoming one of the few players ever to play 
on Stanley Cup and Olympic championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Naslund, 34, played eight seasons with the Montreal Canadiens, then returned 
to Sweden after the 1989-90 season.These Games are his third. He played on 
Sweden's bronze-medal team at Lake Placid in 1980 and on the one that finished 
fifth at Albertville two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be important to be one of the few guys in the world to do that, but 
the main thing is to be here and just play in another Olympics," Naslund said. 
"It's a great experience and you get a nice atmosphere. (Sweden) won a gold 
today from (skier) Pernilla Wiberg, and that was nice. But I'm too old to play 
on this level anymore. It takes too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Naslund has seen international hockey influenced by the NHL, 
and vice versa. Given the choice, he'd watch an NHL game.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's faster in the NHL, but with my age, it's easier to play here because 
there's less hitting," he said. "The NHL is probably more European than it was 
10 years ago and over here, guys are hitting more, so it's a little bit 
tougher." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Canadian goalie Corey Hirsch has been surprised by the U.S. team's struggles 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're feeling the heat," he said. "There's a lot of pressure put on 
them to be the 1980 miracle team. That's the thing about our team -- nobody 
expected anything from us and didn't respect us, and now they have to respect 
us for what we've done." HELENE ELLIOTT

 Canadian Coach Tom Renney, who broke up the high-scoring Paul Kariya-Petr 
Nedved-Chris Kontos line occasionally in the tournament's first four games, did 
not use them as a unit at all Monday. Kariya, who spent most of the game at 
left wing with Brian Savage and Dwayne Norris, didn't mind the change. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's helped all of us, especially today, because we didn't have just the one 
line," he said. "When we rotate our lines, it keeps everyone on the other team 
off balance." 
</P>
<P>
 He also rejected the judgment by Pierre Gauthier, Mighty Duck assistant 
general manager, that he has been pressing to score here. 
</P>
<P>
 "International tournaments are not like North America," he said. "The play is 
a lot different. The team's winning, and I felt I've been playing pretty well 
and that I can pick it up and play better in the medal round. I'm handling the 
puck more and I'm more into the flow of the game and creating more 
opportunities." HELENE ELLIOTT

NOTEBOOK; HARDING IS SLATED TO SKATE EIGHTH IN TECHNICAL PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tonya Harding will be the eighth of 27 women to skate in Wednesday night's 
technical program. 
</P>
<P>
 It could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
 When it came time for Gale Tanger, U.S. Figure Skating Assn. team leader, to 
take a number for Harding from a hat in the official draw Monday at the Olympic 
Amphitheatre in Hamar, the only three left were 1, 8 and 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding's coach, Diane Rawlinson, said later she was hoping Tanger would not 
draw the 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Competitors prefer not to go on early because judges tend to reserve higher 
marks in case they see skaters later in the program that they like better. 
Brian Boitano also discovered when he skated first in the men's technical 
program last week that the crowd in Hamar does not arrive until later, 
detracting from the atmosphere.  
</P>
<P>
 The other U.S. skater, Nancy Kerrigan, drew 26th. Because she finished fifth 
in the 1993 World Championships, she is a seeded competitor here. That 
automatically allowed her a more attractive starting position than Harding, who 
did not compete in last year's World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Another non-seeded competitor is two-time Olympic champion Katarina Witt of 
Germany, who drew fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, who is taking anti-inflammatory medication for her sore right ankle, 
did not seem to be affected by the injury in two practice sessions Monday. But 
she still has not done a complete run-through of either her technical or 
freestyle programs since she arrived here last Wednesday, despite encouragement 
from her coach, her coach's husband and her choreographer. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a whole entourage," said 1992 silver medalist Paul Wylie, a close 
friend of Kerrigan's. "They're clapping for every move she makes. It's like a 
sixth-grade play." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan, meantime, practiced only once Monday, performing her long program 
with no significant mistakes for the first time in a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Although USFSA officials have repeatedly said they could not enter an 
alternate after Monday's draw, International Skating Union officials have 
corrected them. They said Monday that if either Harding or Kerrigan has an 
injury that is verified by an ISU-certified doctor before the start of 
Wednesday night's competition, alternate Michelle Kwan, 13, of Torrance, would 
be allowed to skate. Just in case, she is training in a rink near Oslo. RANDY 
HARVEY

 After finishing second in the 20k relay, the Norwegian women ripped the 
Norwegian press. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wish to thank our supporters among the athletic community and the 
public.We do not thank the press corps," Anita Moen and Trude Dybendahl said in 
a joint statement. "You have lost touch with reality and expect nothing but 
gold."  
</P>
<P>
 Moen also accused the Norwegian media of gender bias. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Bjorn Daehlie (of Norway) beats Vladimir Smirnov (of Kazakhstan), nobody 
suggests that this is because Smirnov is out of shape," she said. "Had we taken 
the gold medal, everyone would have said our rivals skied poorly, not that we 
were good." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Dybendahl, "We would like to feel that the press has faith in us, too. 
It doesn't make it any easier for us when you predict we have no future." 
</P>
<P>
 The Norwegian team was not without support. Officials said 850 buses carried 
40,000 spectators to Birkebeineren Ski Stadium for the relay and estimated that 
30,000 of them were from southern Norway. ROSS NEWHAN

 A flap over who really won the the women's 15k biathlon on Friday apparently 
was laid to rest, with no change in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
 Television analyst Ken Karpoff, a former biathlete, had reported Sunday on 
Canadian TV that targets failed to register hits at least four times in the 
skiing-shooting event and that Svetlana Paramygina of Belarus, not Canadian 
Myriam Bedard, should have been the winner.Paramygina finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was conducted correctly," said Peter Bayer, secretary general of 
the International Biathlon Union, citing videotapes as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedard said, "With those targets there is no doubt. We have checked the TV 
videotapes together with the jury. We can absolutely say that the targets were 
exactly correct." 
</P>
<P>
 Karpoff, who competed at Calgary with the Canadian biathlon team in 1988, used 
a computer-enlarged videotape of the targets in his report.

EGOROVA GETS RECORD-TYING GOLD MEDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lyubov Egorova tied the record for gold medals in the Winter Olympics here 
Monday when she won her sixth, skiing the clinching anchor leg for Russia in 
the women's 20-kilometer cross-country relay. 
</P>
<P>
 The medal was Egorova's third gold here and she won three in France at the 
1992 Albertville Games.She tied Soviet speedskater Lydia Skoblikova, who won 
her six in 1960 and '64. 
</P>
<P>
 Egorova has won gold or silver in every Olympic event she has skied and will 
try to break the record Thursday in the 30k classical. Besides three golds 
here, she won a silver in the first of the women's races, the 15k freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Norway went into the last leg leading by a second but Egorova moved ahead on 
an uphill segment and Russia finished in 57 minutes 12.5 seconds. Norway was 
second in 57:42.6, and Italy was third in 58:42.6, as Manuela Di Centa, the 15k 
champion, won her fourth medal of these Games. She was runner-up to Egorova in 
both the 5k classical and the 10k pursuit.

TENNIS / EVERT CUP; IT WON'T GET ANY EASIER FOR AUSTIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With top-ranked Steffi Graf not scheduled to play Monday, the spotlight at the 
Evert Cup fell on a former No. 1 player, Tracy Austin. 
</P>
<P>
 Austin defeated Radka Zrubakova of Slovakia, 6-2, 5-7, 6-3, at Hyatt Grand 
Champions to set up a probable second-round matchup against Graf, who will play 
Gigi Fernandez today. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf and Austin haven't faced one another since Austin defeated the German, 
6-4, 6-0, at Filderstadt, Germany, in Graf's first professional match. 
</P>
<P>
 That was in October of 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd won the tournament two or three times before," said Austin, who actually 
was the four-time defending champion, "and I played this little skinny kid I'd 
never heard of before. I think she got the wild card and she was 13 years old. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "She was extremely confident walking on the court and she started hitting the 
ball so hard. I thought, 'How can a little skinny kid like that hit the ball so 
hard?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although Austin won easily -- she is one of only 10 players to win a set at 
love against Graf -- she was impressed. "I knew she had tremendous potential," 
Austin said. "I don't know that I could have said, 'This girl's going to be No. 
1 in two or three years,' or whatever it was, but I knew that she was going to 
be extremely good. Just the confidence level -- that was the key. She just 
walked out there and knew what she wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Does she look forward to the rematch? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, probably like going to the dentist," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other matches, No. 5 Helena Sukova and No. 7 Sabine Hack lost. Elena 
Likhovtseva beat Sukova, 6-1, 7-5; and Iva Majoli beat Hack, 6-3, 4-6, 7-6 
(7-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Austin struggled to close out her match against Zrubakova, losing four 
consecutive games after building a 5-3 lead in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're up, (6-2), 5-3, you nail the coffin closed," Austin said. "And I 
let her get back in the match a little bit. I really think that's from (not) 
being in that situation more times (in the last year)." 
</P>
<P>
 She regained control by breaking Zrubakova in the first game of the third set 
and 30 minutes later, turned her thoughts toward Graf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll have absolutely no pressure," Austin said. "I've (been a TV commentator 
on) enough matches that I know what I want to try to do. It's doing them that 
I've got to do."

 Dave Stewart criticized police in the Tampa suburb of Dunedin, Fla., for their

 Stewart denied he or Stottlemyre struck anyone during the incident early 
Sunday. He also disputed reports that said his refusal to pay a $3 cover charge 
led to the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that I did was in reaction to what was done to me," said Stewart, 
who was out on the town celebrating his 37th birthday.

SANTA ANITA; BIEN BIEN DOESN'T HAVE SOFT SPOT FOR TURF CONDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Add another race, the San Luis Obispo Handicap, to the list of stakes that 
Bien Bien has been unable to win over soft courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Bien Bien was winless in three attempts on soft going, and after the weekend 
rain, his owners and trainer debated about running Monday at Santa Anita in the 
$221,400 San Luis Obispo. Although the sky was clear, the course was still 
listed as good, and there was Bien Bien losing again, this time by 
three-quarters of a length to Fanmore after 1 1/2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Paco Gonzalez, Bien Bien's trainer, did not use the course condition as an 
excuse. Those who walked the grass layout before the race said the course could 
almost have been labeled firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "The track (condition) had nothing to do with it," Gonzalez said. "I thought 
we might have a chance at the top of the stretch, but he was too far back. He 
did get into a little trap over there (near the half-mile pole)." 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Delahoussaye was a new jockey for Bien Bien, replacing the injured 
Laffit Pincay, who had become a replacement for the suspended Chris McCarron. 
</P>
<P>
 "He handled the surface all right," Delahoussaye said, "but I would have liked 
it if the turf had been a little firmer, because he didn't seem happy. Even so, 
he made a move at the head of the stretch and it looked like we were going to 
maybe get there. Then in the last sixteenth (of a mile), he hung." 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Desormeaux, the meeting's leading rider with 45 victories -- including 
Lakeway in Sunday's Las Virgenes Stakes -- rode Fanmore, a 6-year-old gelding 
who had already made two starts here this winter, running second in the San 
Gabriel Handicap on Jan. 1 and first in an allowance race two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 In the allowance victory, at 1 1/8 miles, Fanmore took the lead at the start 
and couldn't be caught, which is what happened Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a question about whether he could get a mile and a half," trainer Bobby 
Frankel said. "He hadn't run that far over there (in Europe), and until a horse 
tries the distance, you never know." 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel had another concern with about a half-mile left, when Grand Flotilla 
spurted from the middle of the pack to challenge Fanmore for the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was an early move that other horse made, and I thought the two of them 
might kill each other off," Frankel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fanmore, owned by Prince Khalid Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, paid $7.20 as the 
second betting choice and earned $131,400. Bien Bien, the 9-10 favorite, 
carried high weight of 124 pounds, eight more than the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Fanmore has won six times and had four seconds in 11 starts, and is headed for 
the San Juan Capistrano Handicap, at about 1 3/4 miles, on April 24. Bien 
Bien's next race probably will be the 1 1/2-mile San Luis Rey Stakes on March 
27. 
</P>
<P>
 Bien Bien finished three-quarters of a length ahead of third-place Navire in a 
field that was cut to nine by three scratches. The winning time was 2:27, 
three-fifths of a second faster than Kotashaan's victory on a yielding course a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel might have been worried about the challenge from Grand Flotilla, but 
Desormeaux wasn't. "When the gray horse came to us," the jockey said, "my horse 
absolutely sprinted around the turn, pricked up his ears and said, 'Where's the 
next one?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bien Bien was third most of the way, trailing by about five lengths midway 
down the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the end, I could hear (track announcer Trevor Denman say) that Bien Bien 
was coming," Desormeaux said. "I was scared. I held my horse together to the 
sixteenth pole, then I just threw everything I had at him." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Desormeaux, riding Kotashaan, who beat Bien Bien three times at Santa 
Anita last year, with their final meeting in the Breeders' Cup Turf in 
November. Kotashaan, who was voted horse of the year, has been retired to stud. 
</P>
<P>
 "After losing Kotashaan, (Fanmore) has filled a big empty spot for me," 
Desormeaux said.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach: Ken Lutz (fifth year). 
</P>
<P>
 1992-93: 15-3, 10-0 in the Orange League; finished 12th in the Southern 
Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Jarrod Brunner, Sr.; Bob Bryant, Sr.; Paul Chiotti, Sr.; Keith 
Matsuno, Sr.; Mike Peterson, Sr.; Wayne Spurlock, Sr.; Wayne Wilson, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Kevin Creagh, Jr.; Anthony Eliason, So. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Last year, the Wildcats split dual matches with Sunny Hills and 
Esperanza but had a dismal performance in the Southern Regional -- three of 
their six players shot 90 or above. But all except one of their top six players 
are returning and they are all experienced seniors. "We don't have any shining 
stars, but I've got five solid guys and depending on the day, we can turn in 
some good numbers," Lutz said. All five have been with the program for four 
years. Brunner and Matsuno are three-year varsity lettermen and Peterson has 
been the team's top player for the past two years. Chiotti, quarterback on the 
football team, skipped basketball this year to concentrate on golf. Wilson 
showed the biggest improvement last year.

 Coach: Dave Donnellan (second year). 
</P>
<P>
 1992-93: 15-3, 11-3 in the Sea View League; finished in a three-way tie for 
fifth in the Southern Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Scott Bemis, Sr.; Jenny Glasgow, Jr.; Jimmy Keane, So.; Billy 
Sarracino, So., averaged 39; Kevin Walden, Sr., averaged 40.5. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Craig Welker, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Donnellan, an assistant professional at Newport Beach Country Club, 
said the Sea Kings should be strong because of their even temperaments. "They 
really don't let things bother them," Donnellan said. "Every one of these kids 
is a quiet, quiet, quiet reserved individual and I think that's what you need 
for good golf. You need introspective deep thinkers and every varsity player is 
a thinker." Four players return from the team last year, and Welker played for 
the varsity the year before. Sarracino was the No. 2 player last year as a 
freshman, and Walden is being recruited by California. "We're going to be very 
competitive," Donnellan said. "I would assume so because they have all been 
there before."

 Coach: Al Safallo (12th year). 
</P>
<P>
 1992-93: 17-1, 10-0 in the Empire League; finished fourth in the Southern 
Regional, four shots behind third-place Servite. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Chris Berry, Sr., won Empire League individual title; Ryan 
Donovan, So.; Jason Henderson, Sr.; Bill Kelly, Sr.; Scott Lucidi, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Andy Bergdahl, Sr.; Jeff Cary, Sr.; Bill Manos, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Esperanza was highly ranked last season but missed qualifying for the 
Southern Section team final by four strokes. Only one player -- Henderson, who 
shot 76 -- shot better than 80 at the team regional. Few teams in the county 
have a stronger top three. Berry, who will attend Arizona, has won consecutive 
league titles and finished fifth at the Southern Section individual 
championships last year. Donovan and Henderson are just a few strokes behind, 
and Safallo said Lucidi is not too far behind that. Safallo is bullish. "They 
seem to want it and they work at it," Safallo said. "I have a lot of guys here 
that are putting a lot of time in. It will be a long time before we have 
anything like this again."

 Coach: Dave Duran (seventh year). 
</P>
<P>
 1992-93: 18-0, 10-0 in the Sea View League; won the CIF-SCGA team 
championship; finished second in the Southern Section team final. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Kellee Booth, Sr., won her second consecutive CIF-SCGA girls'

Sr.; Stephen Wagner, So. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Kelly Craig, Fr.; Nicholas Duran, So.; Sean Lim, Fr.; Brian 
Wally, So. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: The Eagles seem to have a deeper team than last year's. Booth and 
Wagner, who had the Eagles' low score at CIF-SCGA, are stronger players than 
most teams' No. 1 and No. 2 players, and Duran says he might have 10 players 
who will average 40 or better. Duran said Craig is as solid as Wagner was last 
year as a freshman. "We should be at least capable of being in the hunt again 
for a state position," Duran said. "That's not to say we'll win it, but if 
everybody plays to their scheduled potential and everybody is at least as good 
as last year, I think we should be in the hunt."

1994 PREP GOLF: SIX TEAMS TO WATCH; HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach: Bill Seckington (17th year). 
</P>
<P>
 1992-93: 13-5, 10-2 in the Sunset League; finished in a three-way tie for 
fifth in the Southern Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Scott Blaska, Sr.; Perry Dickey, So., averaged 78.5; Jeff 
Farley, Jr., averaged 74.5; Greg Uberuaga, Sr., averaged 77.8; Brian Schippel, 
Jr.; Gabe Shiwota, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Tony Mendoza, Fr.; Chris Wilson, So. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Huntington Beach was another team that wasn't happy with its finish 
last season, but the Oilers have all but one of their starters and another 
letterman back to try again this season. Farley, the Sunset League MVP, and 
Uberuaga were No. 1 and 2 last season and Dickey, whose father, Perry Jr., is 
the director of golf at SeaCliff Country Club, was No. 4. The Oilers are 
tight-knit and dedicated to improving -- four of them recently took it upon 
themselves to play Pelican Hill Golf Club and paid the twilight rate of $50 
each. "They felt disappointed not playing to their capabilities in the regional 
qualifying tournament last year," Seckington said. "They all worked really hard 
in the off-season."

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; PEREZ SAYS ELBOW IS FEELING FINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eduardo Perez hung around major league clubhouses before he could walk, 
cavorted with Pete Rose, Johnny Bench and Joe Morgan before he could talk and 
celebrated World Series championships before elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the son of Tony Perez realizes there's nothing like the euphoria of his 
first major league training camp as a player. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is unbelievable, I'm still trying to get over it," said Perez, who's 
expected to be the Angels' opening-day left fielder. "I tell people I'm just 
glad to be here, and they think I'm joking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seriously, I can't describe how good this feels." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, who will wear his father's number (24) this season, wondered a month 
ago if he would make it to camp. He was training in Miami when his right elbow 
stiffened. He feared something was wrong, but X-rays revealed no ligament 
damage. He had inflammation of the elbow, which had sidelined him the final few 
days of the 1993 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was worried for a while," Perez said, "but I've been rehabbing so much that 
nothing was going to keep me back. I'm here now, and there's nothing in the 
world like it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels will be unable to reconstruct the 2,500 seats at Anaheim Stadium 
that were damaged in last month's earthquake by opening day, according to Kevin 
Uhlich, Angel assistant vice president. However, they remain optimistic that 
they will have a temporary scoreboard in place, and hope to have everything 
fixed by mid-season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Bo Jackson introduced himself to pitcher Scott Lewis, he was stopped and 
immediately corrected. Lewis reminded him that they already had met. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, we met before," Lewis said. "I guess you don't remember, but the first 
time we met, you hit a pinch-hit homer off me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know about you, but I sure haven't forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who never has played first base in his amateur or professional 
career, doesn't sound like someone who plans to make a career in the infield. 
"Don't get any crazy ideas," said Jackson, who has been taking ground balls at 
first the last two days. "I've just been helping out the pitchers, that's all." 
Said Angel Manager Buck Rodgers: "I just want him to get comfortable with the 
ballclub, whether he plays first base or not. We'll find out in (exhibition) 
games whether he can do it." . . . Dan O'Brien, former Angel general manager, 
is considered the leading candidate to become commissioner of the Arizona Fall 
League. . . . Former Angel outfielder Von Hayes, who sat out all last season, 
is working out in the Milwaukee Brewers' minor-league camp. . . . Former Angel 
third baseman Kelly Gruber, who played only 18 games last season because of 
rotator-cuff surgery and herniated disks in his neck, told friends that he will 
sit out this season and attempt to play in 1995. . . . Troy Percival, who a 
year ago was billed as the man who would replace Bryan Harvey, is recovering 
quickly from reconstructive elbow surgery. He is expected to begin throwing at 
full-strength within a month.

NORTHRIDGE'S FAST START DISSOLVES INTO 10-5 LOSS; COLLEGE BASEBALL: 
THIRD-RANKED FULLERTON TRACKS DOWN CSUN AFTER FALLING BEHIND, 3-0. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Outfielder Brian Vasey took a mighty swing and slammed the soles of his spikes 
together in the Cal State Northridge dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 Gobs of mud, grass, chalk and water flew everywhere. All of which had nothing 
to do with his coach's assessment of Northridge's 10-5 nonconference loss to 
third-ranked Cal State Fullerton on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an immature, inexperienced group," Northridge Coach Bill Kernen said of 
his troops. "We're just getting our feet wet." 
</P>
<P>
 In more ways than one, as Vasey found out. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Vasey peeled out while trying to run down a pop fly in foul 
territory and never recovered in time to make the catch. Likewise, Northridge 
had enough horsepower, but spent most of the afternoon spinning its wheels and 
going nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors (4-5) had 12 hits, but stranded a season-high 13 runners -- 
despite hitting into two double plays. The lack of a timely hit was a carryover 
from Saturday's game with Fullerton, during which Northridge left two runners 
on base in the bottom of the ninth and lost, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "For whatever reason, we can't get in sync," Kernen said. "If people put their 
best out there and get blown away, well, that would be something else. But 
that's not happening." 
</P>
<P>
 The runs weren't especially happening, at least not after a fast start. 
Northridge jumped to a 3-0 lead in the second when slumping first baseman Jason 
Shanahan ripped a three-run homer over the fence in right. It marked the 
season's first runs batted in for Shanahan, a returning starter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (12-1) closed within 3-2 on a two-run homer by catcher Bret Hemphill 
(four RBIs) in the second, yet the Matadors appeared ready to counter when they 
banged out three consecutive singles in the third to load the bases against 
senior right-hander Dan Ricabal, who was 11-3 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasey and third baseman Tyler Nelson, both first-year starters, stuck out to 
end the threat, however, and the frustration only mounted. By the time Ricabal 
(2-0) was replaced after five innings by Mike Parisi, he had given up eight 
hits, walked one and hit a batter. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Fullerton held an 8-3 lead by then, in part because Northridge 
right-hander Keven Kempton (0-2) continued to struggle. Kempton, who won 10 
games last year, gave up eight earned runs and 10 hits over six innings. As a 
result, the team earned-run average ballooned to 5.56. 
</P>
<P>
 Kempton gave up five consecutive singles to open the fourth -- two never left 
the infield -- as Fullerton scored three times to take a 5-3 lead. In the 
sixth, with Fullerton holding an 8-4 lead, Kempton and Nelson committed a 
double-ugly on the same ball that contributed to a two-run rally. 
</P>
<P>
 With a runner at first, Craig Skyberg dumped a sacrifice bunt down the 
third-base line. Kempton let the ball slip through his bare hand for an error. 
Yet Kempton deflected the ball toward Nelson, who fired past first for another 
error, allowing a run to score and Skyberg to move to second. 
</P>
<P>
 Skyberg later scored for a 10-4 lead. Parisi gave up two runs and four hits 
over the final four innings to earn his first career save. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 10-5, Northridge loaded the bases with two out in the seventh, but 
Parisi struck out Joey Arnold to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "As bad as that looked -- and it looked bad at times -- we still had a shot," 
Kernen said. "Teams just go through spells like this."

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL: RILEY LAUDED AT SURPRISE POST-GAME 
CELEBRATION 
</P>

<P>
 As time ran out in Fullerton's 71-51 loss to Golden West last Friday in an 
Orange Empire Conference women's basketball game, Hornet Coach Colleen Riley 
figured her night was about over. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the loss, a major celebration was about to start in the Fullerton 
gym for Riley, who is stepping down as coach after this, her 25th season. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley will remain on staff at the college and continue as women's athletic 
director. Riley, with 559-146 record, is the winningest community college 
women's basketball coach in state history. 
</P>
<P>
 In the half hour after the game against Golden West, Riley received several 
honors. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Fullerton issued a proclamation saying that Feb. 18, 1994, was 
Colleen Riley Day. She also received a key to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Letters of congratulation from several coaches were read and former players 
spoke about Riley, who coached Fullerton to 15 conference titles, six Southern 
California championships and a State title (1978). Her teams had only two 
losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley also got a $500 donation from Boege's Sporting Goods to help finish a 
team room, which has been a long-time project for her. 
</P>
<P>
 After the honors, Riley was taken, by limousine, to dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was really nice," she said about the celebration. "I was totally taken 
by surprise. But then I'm pretty much oblivious to the world at times." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, 52, moved to Southern California from Michigan with her family in 1959. 
She went to Anaheim High School, then Fullerton College, where she played 
basketball, softball, field hockey, volleyball and was on the swim team. 
</P>
<P>
 She then went to Whittier College, where she earned her bachelor of arts 
degree. She got her master's at Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley taught and coached at Valencia and El Dorado high schools before taking 
over at Fullerton in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't words to describe how much Colleen Riley has meant not only to 
Fullerton College but to women's athletics everywhere," said Susan Bears, 
Fullerton's dean of physical education. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley is looking forward to the free time ahead of her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basketball has been very good to me in my life," Riley said. "I'm still going 
to go to games, but now I can just sit in the stands and not worry about missed 
free throws and turnovers." 
</P>

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; BACH'S HEART IS IN NORWAY, BUT LOVE FOR 
TENNIS KEEPS HIM HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Watching TV seldom makes Fredrik Bach homesick, but for the last 10 days, he 
has been sitting on the couch and taking trips down nostalgia lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Bach, a junior tennis player at UC Irvine, lives a couple of hours from the 
sites where Dan Jansen, Tommy Moe and Picabo Street won Olympic medals. 
</P>
<P>
 All of those freeze-frame-go-to-commercial shots from Norway are so many 
postcards from home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still spend every summer home in Norway," said Bach, who lives in 
Porsgrunn, a small town south of Oslo, "and I talk to my friends there a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, a lot of people weren't sure they wanted the Olympics because of 
the financial aspect. It still might be a big bust moneywise, but everyone is 
really excited. A lot of the events were sold out three or four months ago and 
we've had the most snow this winter since 1964." 
</P>
<P>
 His parents now live in Tampa, but Bach misses his friends and countrymen, and 
says he plans on returning to live full-time in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see myself moving back," he said. "I really like it there. It's more quiet, 
more relaxed. It's funny because people here seem more friendly. You walk down 
the street and everyone says, 'Hi.' There, they walk right by and never make 
eye contact. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think the friendships you make there are maybe more genuine. In a tiny 
country up by the north pole, with only 10,000 people in your town and one 
house every 300 meters, you can do your own thing. You're not forced to 
interact with people as much as you do here. But when you get to know people, 
it's a sincere friendship." 
</P>
<P>
 Bach misses the snow and the winter sports, but he knows his tennis career has 
a better chance of blossoming under the California sun. He was the top-ranked 
12-year-old in Norway before his father, an executive with a Norwegian 
fertilizer company, was transferred to Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a big sports center near where we lived and some of the best 
players practiced there, so it was OK," Bach said. "I graduated their version 
of high school when I was 15. I felt I was too young to go to college, so I 
just played tennis in Norway for a year. I played a lot of international junior 
tennis and was ranked as high as 37th in the world, but the days were long and 
I was lonely." 
</P>
<P>
 So Bach went to a tennis academy in Florida for a year and devoted himself to 
studying English and backhands. It was there he decided to go to college in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 He hadn't been a student for two years but soon found himself at home in 
Irvine's classrooms and on the courts. He is a two-time Big West Scholar 
Athlete and compiled a 35-24 singles record in his first two seasons with 
Irvine, competing mostly at No. 3. He won 11 of his last 12 matches last year 
and his second consecutive flight three Big West singles title. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Bach is 2-4 in singles, but that includes an 0-3 mark at the No. 
2 position and losses to USC's Jon Leach, ranked 43rd in the nation, and 
Stanford All-American Vimal Patel. 
</P>
<P>
 Bach is working hard to overcome his slow-court background and develop a more 
aggressive style of play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fredrik's on his way to developing an all-court game," Coach Steve Clark 
said. "He had a great summer, was a finalist at the Norwegian championships, so 
his baseline game is obviously established. What he's striving for now is 
developing an attack game." 
</P>
<P>
 Bach says it's more a matter of mind-set than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can do it and I do it in practice, but when you're playing a match and a 
little bit nervous, you tend to fall back to what's most comfortable," he said. 
"But I've worked a lot on it in practice and hopefully, without thinking about 
it, it will start to seep into my matches." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Porous perimeter: Early in the season, you could pass it off as misfortune. 
Maybe opponents' three-point shooters were just hot against the Anteaters. But 
it has become a trend as clear as an opposing jump-shooter's view of the basket 
-- the Anteaters aren't doing much of a job when it comes to defending the 
perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's conference opponents are shooting 46% from three-point range, by far 
the highest percentage allowed in the Big West. More important, when the 
Anteaters do a decent job of defending outside shots, they often win. 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine's three conference victories, Cal State Fullerton, Utah State and 
Nevada made 13 of 43 three-pointers. (30%). 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Rod Baker thinks his team is doing a better job of getting out and 
harassing outside shooters, but recent results aren't encouraging. Las Vegas 
and New Mexico State combined to hit 15 of 27 three-point shots -- a whopping 
56% -- last week. 
</P>
<P>
 That's 45 points in 27 possessions and better than shooting 80% from two-point 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine will be host for the Big West swimming and diving championships this 
weekend at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. UC Santa Barbara's men's and women's 
teams are the defending champions. The event is Sunday through Tuesday with 
preliminaries at 10:30 a.m. each day and the finals at 6 p.m. . . . The women's 
basketball team had a rare chance to celebrate in a snowstorm Saturday night in 
Reno after its last-second, 64-63, victory. The Anteaters (3-19 and 2-12 in the 
Big West) won for the first time on the road in 17 games. The victory completed 
a sweep of the Wolf Pack, Irvine's first since the 1990-91 season.

NEWSWIRE: KRAMER SIGNS WITH THE BEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN HERBERT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Erik Kramer, a former Burroughs High and Pierce College standout 
who helped Detroit win the NFC Central title last season, signed a three-year 
contract with the Chicago Bears on Monday, worth a reported $8.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the perfect situation," Kramer said."I couldn't have drawn it up any 
better. It was an opportunity to come to an organization with a rich tradition. 
I'm coming to an offense I consider suited to my strengths and I'm moving in a 
direction to where the whole organization wants to win." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears have indicated they would like to trade Jim Harbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quarterback position is solidified, obviously," Bear Coach Dave Wannstedt 
said. "We got the guy we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer will receive a $900,000 signing bonus, and salaries of $2.1 million, 
$2.3 million and $2.5 million in each of the next three seasons, along with a 
$100,000 rostersigning bonus, the Chicago Tribune reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears evaluated over 15 free-agent quarterbacks, including Chris Chandler 
of Phoenix, Chris Mitchell of Atlanta and Scott Mitchell of Miami before 
settling on Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no question the No. 1 guy we were focused on was Erik," Chicago 
Coach Dave Wannstedt said, calling Kramer "a winner in every situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer said he had been sought by other teams, and that Detroit made him a 
competitive offer, but he felt it was time for a change. 
</P>
<P>
 A Bears spokesman said Kramer's signing will lead to the start of trade talks 
regarding Harbaugh, the team's starting quarterback for the past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The 29-year old Kramer began his professional career in 1987, signing with the 
New Orleans Saints as an undrafted rookie out of North Carolina State. STEVEN

TITANS DEFEAT NORTHRIDGE; STREAK AT 11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton ran its winning streak to 11 games by beating Cal State 
Northridge, 10-5, in a nonconference baseball game Monday at Titan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (12-1), ranked third in the nation by Collegiate Baseball, scored 
three runs in the fourth inning and three in fifth to take an 8-3 lead and led, 
10-4, after six. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors (4-5) had 12 hits, but stranded a season-high 13 runners. It was 
a carry over from Saturday's game with Fullerton, during which Northridge left 
two runners on base in the bottom of the ninth and lost, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge took a 3-0 lead in the second when first baseman Jason Shanahan hit 
a three-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (12-1) closed to within 3-2 in the second on a two-run homer by 
catcher Bret Hemphill, who drove in four runs. Yet the Matadors appeared ready 
to counter when they got three consecutive singles in the third to load the 
bases against senior right-hander Dan Ricabal. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Vasey and Tyler Nelson struck out to end the threat, however, and the 
frustration only mounted for the visitors. By the time Ricabal (2-0) was 
replaced after five innings by Mike Parisi, he had allowed eight hits, walked 
one and hit a batter. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Fullerton held an 8-3 lead, partly because Northridge 
right-hander Keven Kempton (0-2) continued to struggle. Kempton, who won 10 
games last year, gave up eight earned runs on 10 hits over six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Kempton gave up five consecutive singles to open the fourth -- two never left 
the infield -- as Fullerton scored three times to take a 5-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisi allowed two runs on four hits over the final four innings to earn his 
first college save. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 10-5, in the seventh, Northridge loaded the bases with two outs. But 
Parisi struck out Joey Arnold to end the threat. STEVE ELLING

1994 PREP GOLF PREVIEW; HUNTINGTON BEACH'S FARLEY BALANCES GAME, OTHER 
INTERESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even for a serious young golfer such as Jeff Farley, the distractions of this 
town can be tempting. 
</P>
<P>
 And though Farley, a junior at Huntington Beach High, isn't usually one to 
head to the beach instead of the practice range, he is learning that the normal 
tugs of adolescence can be disconcerting when you are trying to be the best 
young golfer you can be. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there other pastimes to compete with golf for his spare time. Homework 
takes more time than it used to. Not all of his friends play golf, so 
socializing could take him away from the links. So could the car detailing 
business he and a friend started. Then there's his passion for collecting 
alternative music. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you get older there are more and more distractions," Farley said. "I know 
I just got interested in girls and that's a big one." 
</P>
<P>
 But Farley says he's on his way to finding a comfortable balance -- one that 
will allow him to be a somewhat typical teen-ager and still excel at the sport 
he loves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned I have to get my life straight in terms of school and my 
spiritual life," Farley said. "I have to have the other parts of my life in 
line and then golf will fall into place." 
</P>
<P>
 A well-adjusted Farley could mean trouble for the Sunset League. As a 
sophomore last season, he won the league's individual title and helped the 
Oilers to a second-place finish in league. 
</P>
<P>
 The success came amid a prolonged slump that he believes he has been able to 
kick after about 1 1/2 years. If he has, he has a decent shot at becoming the 
league's first consecutive champion since Huntington Beach's Mike Ivy won four 
titles from 1977 to 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his short game -- specifically short wedge shots -- that abandoned him 
during the slump. The problem was compounded by the way he dealt with mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was making a big issue over a couple of bad shots and letting it control my 
game," Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
 It made for a long summer. He wasn't accepted to any of the national junior 
tournaments that many of his peers competed in and instead played 
inconsistently in local tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he enlisted the help of David Wright, a teaching professional and 
sports psychologist who lives in Coto de Caza. Farley learned of Wright from 
another top high school golfer, his close friend Chris Berry of Esperanza. 
Wright also has worked with Santa Margarita's Kellee Booth and several LPGA and 
PGA players. 
</P>
<P>
 Farley said Wright has helped him focus on his game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been struggling with the mental side of the game," Farley said. "It's 
been quite a battle, but I think once I have overcome it, it's just going to 
make me a stronger player." 
</P>
<P>
 Farley already has seen improvement. In December, he finished second at a 
national tournament in Palm Desert and is hopeful that he has gained momentum 
entering the high school season. 
</P>
<P>
 But Farley, who recently turned 17, is still guarding against the distractions 
of youth. He follows a daily schedule that Wright helped him prepare to 
maximize success in golf and the classroom. Farley rises early to attend his 
first class at 7 a.m. so he can have the afternoon free for about 3 1/2 hours 
of practice. Five-thirty to 8 p.m. has been blocked out for dinner and studying 
with the rest of the evening free for running and associating with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 When Farley first picked up the sport, he never needed to plan his day around 
playing golf -- many of his days were entirely dedicated to the game. 
</P>
<P>
 He was one of those kids who played from first to last light. He and 
Esperanza's Berry became friends at Oasis Country Club in Palm Desert and they 
often played more than 72 holes a day on the par-60 course. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a competitive friendship. Neither liked to lose -- even when it was 
only low-stakes bets on the putting green. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would just sit out there for hours and putt," Berry said. "I think we made 
each other really good players. I think being around each other helped." 
</P>
<P>
 After a successful summer in 1992 -- including a 11th place finish at an AJGA 
event in Nashville -- Farley appeared poised for further breakthroughs. But 
then he was hit by the intermittent slump. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just lost confidence," Huntington Beach Coach Bill Seckington said. 
"Especially in his short game. Golf is such a mental game. When you lose 
confidence in your swing, you get in trouble. Instead of letting it overwhelm 
him, he went back to some basics and now he's playing really good again." Golf

 Clemson football Coach Tommy West signed a five-year contract that will pay 
him a $110,000 salary and a bonus of almost $10,000 if the Tigers play in a 
bowl. Other perks, such as broadcast appearances, make the package worth close 
to $300,000 a year.

O.C. ART / CATHY CURTIS; FREEING WORDS FROM THEIR LIFE SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now, why would someone organize an exhibition of rather mysterious work by a 
group of mostly little-known artists -- and then write an introduction larded 
with obscure words, difficult locutions and puzzling, fragmentary images? Why 
try to compete with the wayward eccentricity of the artists' own works? 
</P>
<P>
 The nine artists in question are the focus of "Grammarians" at Chapman 
University's Guggenheim Gallery (through March 11). 
</P>
<P>
 According to exhibition notes by curator Michael Anderson, himself an artist 
and a critic for Art issues magazine, "Liberating writing from an everyday 
instrumentality, these artists purchase a brief sovereignty, and their work is 
a placard, as it were, of unalienated labor and personal digression." 
</P>
<P>
 Translation: Unconstrained by everyday uses of language, the artists use words 
however they choose, either as the central or peripheral aspect of their work. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you climb over Anderson's wall of words, however, you can appreciate his 
taste for his highly unusual approaches to language and imagery. Most of the 
works have to do with the involvement of belief, imagination, authority or 
famous precedents in our comprehension of a text. These are meaty themes, and 
the artists clearly assume an audience willing to dig for and evaluate 
different types of information. The effort is well worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 The wittiest works in the show are by Raymond Pettibon, one of the most gifted 
younger artists in Los Angeles, and Kenneth Goldsmith, the lone New Yorker in 
the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Pettibon pairs spare, laconic drawings based on popular imagery with texts 
that combine turns of speech from various sources into a crafty polyphony 
suggesting diverse patterns of thought. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of Pettibon's untitled works, we read the self-conscious thoughts of a 
callow male writer observing a woman in a short strapless dress ("I felt so 
much that I just had to take notes"). In another drawing -- an archetypal 
baseball pitcher winding up -- the verbal counterpoint includes a punning 
platitude ("Life at its highest pitch") and a comically dimwitted reflection 
("What a beautiful moral to be drawn.") 
</P>
<P>
 Goldsmith's piece is an epic nonsense poem based on similarities between the 
sounds and rhythms of words and phrases drawn from high and low culture ("Rocky 
Horror Roto-Rooter Salmonilla Sandinista! . . . Simon Boccanegra smells like 
Magic Marker . . ."). Like a hip, updated Vachel Lindsay (the incantatory early 
20th-Century American poet), Goldsmith plays back the sounds of America, the 
commercial jingles and news headlines that rattle around in our heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Frances Stark also employs lists of words in her art, but she focuses on their 
arbitrary, exclusionary quality. "Through the Magic Door" consists of 
mimeographed sheets of paper with hand-lettered lists (imitating an antiquated 
typeface) of the "100 Great Books." One list dates from 1887; the other, which 
includes John Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath," from 1939 or later. The blue 
ink recalls vintage high school course handouts, yet the hand-lettering 
bizarrely undercuts the text's supposed authority. 
</P>
<P>
 A grudging acknowledgment of women's roles in society and American 
isolationism of the '30s may account for the fact that the newer list includes 
five female authors (in 1887, only George Eliot made the grade), but eliminates 
such non-Western entries as the Koran and the Ramayana in favor of the likes of 
Sherwood Anderson's "Winesburg, Ohio." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is Guy de Cointet, a French-born performance artist who died in 
1983 and was known for such surreal pieces as "My Father's Diary," in which the 
book in question, a memento read by the man's daughter, turns out to be written 
entirely in code. Influenced by French post-structuralist Roland Barthes, de 
Cointet was intrigued by the notion of language without meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence, "Sophie Rummel" -- de Cointet's piece in this show -- in which a 
numerical sequence like "700. 12. 663. 10. 8903. 27." might stand for an 
infinite number of facts about the fictional or real woman in the title. Can 
this code be cracked? Does it matter? Isn't speculation often more interesting 
than knowledge? 
</P>
<P>
 Other artists in the show combine visual and written material to conjure 
small, weird universes that are at least fitfully absorbing, while a couple of 
pieces seem baffling or oddly vacuous. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Weissman's stumbling, crumpled-looking figures look like grim 
relations of the baffled folk immortalized by cartoonist William Steig. Combat 
between the sexes and generalized bleakness are the order of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of these drawings have texts banged out on a typewriter that seems to 
have a permanently stuck shift key -- a dated, amateurish presentation that 
somehow matches the figures' hopelessly cliched predicaments. A woman asks her 
avenging mate, "Why must you always dent the head of another man?" He replies, 
"My head is big. His head is little and also quite soft." 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler Stallings' sprawling fantasy piece, "Castrato-Astronauta," mingles an 
ode to '50s-style science fiction with a wistfully outrageous post-AIDS view of 
sex. (The title evokes the bizarre image of a castrated boy singer who has 
become a female astronaut). 
</P>
<P>
 A large birthday cake made of pink felt (and inscribed, "Happy birthday 
cyberspace sad farewell outer space") dangles over a fallen parachute and the 
castrato's lost member, which has become the body of a mutant spider. A 
photocopied "news story" complete with bogus documentation, matter-of-factly 
relates the castrato's hallucinatory out-of-body experience, in which he 
becomes a male Virgin Mary, agrees to donate sperm for artificial insemination 
and contemplates guiltless sex with his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexis Hall's piece, "Bora Bora," appears to be an archly self-conscious 
narrative about an art school photography student who moonlights as a Los 
Angeles Police Department secretary and is whisked away to a crime scene by a 
man "who assumes his identity through Marlboro ads and pulp novels." 
</P>
<P>
 Printed on 10 large photographs (ads for expensive accouterments and exotic 
travel, romance novel jackets), Hall's narrative reads like a clumsy pastiche 
of B-movie plots, pulp fiction and advertising. In fact, it is the 
"fabulous(ly) successful" art project the student says she made about her 
experience. By making her own slickly packaged form of "art" from a stew of 
gender stereotypes, she reinvents the same sort of hucksterism she appears to 
be critiquing. 
</P>
<P>
 The most puzzling piece in the show might be Lisa Auerbach's set of color 
photographs, "In Color . . . and in Black and White." Most of Auerbach's 
suburban images are of foodstuffs: pumpkins growing in a field, shown chopped 
up in a photograph in an open cookbook, and stewing in a pot on a kitchen 
stove. 
</P>
<P>
 It is tempting to retitle the images, "The Raw and the Cooked," the title of 
one of the books by French structuralist Claude Levi-Strauss that investigated 
formal relationships between different aspects of culture. But what spin 
Auerbach is putting on this material is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 The one work that seems distinctly out of place in this company, however, is 
Gabrielle Jennings' video, "To Whom It May Concern"). In the tradition of the 
rambling, tell-all adolescent diary, it details various out-of-control 
experiences (a drinking binge, a drug trip) of a young woman -- supposedly 
herself -- whose mother was a hippie and who knows her father only from a 
photograph. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the visceral conceit that opens and closes the piece (she has decided 
to cut out her tongue and wants to leave a record of her life), "To Whom It May 
Concern" seems formless and lacking in critical and self-awareness. You wonder 
if she even realizes that she is invoking a sensation of nausea or vertigo to 
describe her reaction to virtually every event in her life. 
</P>

JAZZ REVIEW; DOUBLE THE PLEASURE OF A FINE PIANIST; CECILIA COLEMAN FINDS TWO 
MODES OF EXPRESSION, AS A FEATURED SOLOIST IN A DUO AND AS AN ACCOMPANIST FOR 
VOCALIST SHELLY MOORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The types of proving grounds for jazz musicians are as numerous as musicians 
themselves. One of the least likely of these venues is the Bay Colony, a 
chummy-looking dining-and-tippling establishment tucked into an out-of-the-way 
corner of the county and done up with dark wood and high ceilings, a fireplace, 
black-vinyl booths, shelves decorated with knickknacks and a leaping swordfish 
mounted over the front door. 
</P>
<P>
 Since July, Cecilia Coleman has been doing two shows at the Bay Colony on 
Sunday evenings. The long-running engagement offers a view into two sides of 
the keyboardist's craft, as featured soloist in a piano-bass duo during the 
first half of a set and as an accompanist for vocalist Shelly Moore (who's also 
here on Fridays and Saturdays backed by pianist Les Czimber). 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman, one of the most serious and dedicated pianists on the Southern 
California scene, makes frequent appearances in Los Angeles and Orange County 
as a member of Dan St. Marseille's combo as well as the leader of her own trios 
and, more recently, her quintet with trumpeter Steve Huffsteter and saxophonist 
Andy Suzuki. She received the Los Angeles Jazz Society's Shelly Manne New 
Talent Award in 1990, and last year L.A.P. Records released her first CD, 
"Words of Wisdom." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Coleman worked the Bay Colony with Benjamin May, a bassist who 
makes frequent appearances at the Loew's Hotel in Santa Monica, including a 
regular Monday night gig in which he puts the upright aside and plays solo 
piano. Their half of the set was an ably performed, if not perfect, program of 
standards that highlighted not only the musicians' skills but the give-and-take 
relationship that makes the best duo performances succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 The duo kicked off with a trio of tunes, beginning with a moody rendition of 
"Nature Boy" that featured Coleman's lightly stated theme and a solo built on a 
series of ascending lines. The pianist isn't one out to grab attention with 
chordal pounding and dynamic sweeps. Instead, she pushes the music insistently 
forward with a gentle touch, a technique used to advantage by the late, great 
Bill Evans. There's nothing rushed or frantic about her approach as she strings 
together short, lyrical phrases that seem to build off one another. 
</P>
<P>
 May, working unamplified, complemented this style with firm, though reserved 
accompaniment and a fleet walk that was especially astute during "Young and 
Foolish." Often, he would pick up the bow for his solo work, as he did on 
"Celia," letting the sustained, woody tones hum across the accompaniment that 
Coleman established behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Coleman's lead work had much of a vocal quality, her playing in support 
of Moore was more exploratory, offering chordal tracking behind the voice while 
filling in the spaces with asides and punctuation that sprung from the melody.  
</P>
<P>
 On a ballad-paced "I Thought About You," Coleman seemed to leap into her solo 
as Moore finished the verse, taking the singer's last line and crafting it into 
her own. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore continues to be one of the more satisfying vocalists appearing in the 
area, rhythmically playful while changing the color of her tone in response to 
the lyric's meaning. Though she was working with a cold, she managed to recall 
some of Billie Holiday's tonal roughness during "I Thought About You," and her 
playful, often coy delivery during "Black Coffee" carried some Thespian 
touches. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore's intimacy with an audience is tailor-made for the clubby feel of a room 
like that at the Bay Colony. And, in Coleman, she has found an able accompanist 
for her warm and varied style. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cecilia Coleman performs two shows beginning at 6 p.m. every Sunday at the 
Bay Colony restaurant, 115 N. Harbor Blvd., La Habra. (714) 525-8288. No cover.

MUSIC REVIEW; AN UNEVEN DEDICATION TO FOUNDER; THE SOUTHWEST CHAMBER SOCIETY'S 
TRIBUTE TO PIANIST ALBERT DOMINGUEZ INCLUDES AN INTRIGUING NEW WORK AND SOME 
SUPERFICIAL INTERPRETATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Southwest Chamber Music Society dedicated its Sunday program of 
20th-Century works to one of its founders, the late pianist Albert Dominguez. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the afternoon concert introduced an intriguing new work -- as many had 
during the years of Dominguez's participation -- it also frustrated with some 
superficial interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
 The event in Salmon Recital Hall at Chapman University included a reprise of 
Saturday's premiere performance -- at Pasadena Presbyterian Church -- of 
Frederick Lesemann's "Sir Blue Slips a Trend," for string quartet. The piece, 
which derives its name from an anagram of clever, descriptive titles of 
individual movements, consists of five concise, neatly crafted fugues, each 
with a different theme and character. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southwest String Quartet -- violinists Peter Marsh and Annie Chalex, 
violist Jan Karlin and cellist Roger Lebow -- attended well to shifting ideas 
for a series of rhythmically compelling and intellectually absorbing movements. 
The composition culminated in a busy contrapuntal exercise, cryptically called 
"IDS" Fugue, for Ingolf Dahl -- Lesemann's former composition teacher, known 
for his polyphonic style -- and for Stravinsky, whose rhythmic inventiveness 
was, perhaps, inspirational. 
</P>
<P>
 Pianist Susan Svrcek joined the Southwest Quartet in an uneven reading of the 
Quintet, Opus 57, by Shostakovich. The work began promisingly with an unusually 
ebullient Prelude, which built to a granitic climax, and a dark, pensive Fugue 
that unfolded with sensual energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the closing two movements disappointed -- the Intermezzo emerging 
restrained and monochromatic, the Finale grating, as shallow, relentless 
aggression replaced Shostakovich's boisterous, ungainly lyricism. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert opened with Ravel's Sonata for Violin and Cello, which the 
composer dedicated to the memory of Debussy. Marsh and Lebow brought athletic 
power to their ensemble, for a focused, sometimes driven, reading, relieved 
only by their somber musings during the slow movement.

 If he had known comedian Don Rickles was in Atlantic City, Tom Lasorda would 
have gone there after arriving in Philadelphia one balmy Sunday night last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the players went, and thought they'd had fun. But Lasorda later said 
it would have been much more fun if he had joined them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me ask you this," he said to the players. "How did you get to Atlantic 
City?" 
</P>
<P>
 "We rented a car," one replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda nodded. 
</P>
<P>
 "That means you have no contacts. Heck, there would have been a limo waiting 
for me. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody is waiting for Lasorda practically everywhere he goes, and that's the 
way he wants it. So far, the only place he wasn't immediately recognized was in 
Norway, and it caused some anxiety. Finally, some tourists from California 
showed up . . . "And Tommy breathed a sigh of relief," says Jo, his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only time Lasorda is alone on the road is in the late morning when 
he swims 50 or 60 laps in the hotel pool, and when he sleeps, which isn't 
often. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy never sleeps," Eric Karros said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Peter O'Malley sits back in his chair and glances out the window at his 
sprawling Dodgertown complex in Vero Beach, Fla. Once again, he is being asked 
a question that has become traditional with the opening of spring training: "Is 
this Lasorda's last season?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The speculation happens every year and I understand that, but the presence of 
Reggie (Smith) and the return of Bill Russell has no bearing on Tommy's future 
and it will not be a distraction to the team," O'Malley said. "Tommy knows 
that, we've talked about it. I don't know where any of us are going to be a 
year from now." 
</P>
<P>
 This is Lasorda's 45th year in the Dodger organization, his 18th season as 
manager. His credits are two World Series championships, four National League 
pennants and six Western Division titles, but the last two seasons haven't been 
much fun for the 66-year old manager. O'Malley doesn't blame Lasorda for the 
recent decline, instead pointing to player injuries and an interruption of 
talent at the minor league level. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Russell and Smith were promoted as coaches this season -- Russell as 
Lasorda's bench coach and Smith as the hitting instructor -- it appeared the 
future had arrived. Russell -- long rumored to be the next manager -- had spent 
the past two seasons managing at triple-A Albuquerque, and Smith has been on a 
fast track through the ranks, and is said to have an outside chance at the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this my last season? I have no idea," said Lasorda, whose contract ends 
after the season. "You'd have to ask Peter O'Malley. I will never leave him, I 
will only leave if they want me to leave, and I'm not worried about it. I love 
managing, and I'd like to continue. But I have said this a million times, I 
will do whatever Peter O'Malley wants me to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The speculation doesn't stop with Lasorda. Some have suggested that it might 
be time for O'Malley to step aside, leaving the presidency to Fred Claire, the 
club's general manager. Lasorda could then take Claire's job, a natural step 
for a man who is known as an expert judge of baseball talent. 
</P>
<P>
 But what O'Malley would like to know is, who are these critics anyway? He has 
never given any thought to relinquishing the presidency, he says. He is 
satisfied with Claire and Lasorda in their current roles. He and Lasorda 
haven't talked about the general manager position in years, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tommy has done a great job for us, going back to the days when he scouted for 
us, when he was a minor league manager and a major league coach under Walter 
Alston," O'Malley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if he is thinking of the front office or some other 
responsibility, but I don't think so. I think he now realizes that managing is 
the best spot for him. But you need to ask him, I don't know what he is looking 
for down the road, but he does a very good job for us." 
</P>
<P>
 If Lasorda is past his prime, he certainly doesn't know it. The job is more 
difficult now, he says, because he has to motivate players who didn't grow up 
wearing the Dodger uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day a few years ago I looked up from the dugout, and there were nine guys 
on the field playing for us, all from ex-American League teams," Lasorda said. 
"I have had to change my approach, and work harder at instilling them with the 
pride of wearing a Dodger uniform. When I first took over as manager, 17 of the 
25 guys had played for me before, with four more on their way up. Now it's 
different. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to talk to them and show them how special it is, and I do that by 
being a leader. I want my players to respect me, but I have to earn it. I try 
to show them how proud I am of them, how great it is that they are wearing the 
Dodger uniform. I love this organization so much, and I would never say 
anything against it, no matter what I feel." 
</P>
<P>
 This abundance of gregariousness wears thin on some players, who tire of 
Lasorda's "rah-rah" attitude, but it has always turned some away. And those who 
have been victims of Lasorda's hot temper find it difficult to accept his 
cheerful side.  
</P>
<P>
 "Tommy's got another side, but the side you see isn't phony," said Orel 
Hershiser, who has played 10 seasons for Lasorda. "In fact he is more openly 
sentimental now -- he really shows his players in a more demonstrative way he 
likes them and the effort they put in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, the fact that Tommy liked to go out and eat with the players and 
enjoyed having fun in the locker room with them, everybody knew that, and he 
didn't have to announce that. But now, he will go out of his way to make sure 
people understand him and his managerial philosophy. There's less in the dark 
about who he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are the days when players hung out at the Lasordas in Fullerton, where 
Tommy and Jo still live in a small house on a quiet residential street. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we needed more room, we didn't have the money," Jo said. "And now that 
we have the money, we don't need the room." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Yeager, the former catcher, and some of the players helped build a den 
on the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "We liked to hang out with each other then and with Tommy," Yeager said. "We 
grew up together, and we wanted to be together. Now, it's so different. It's 
like dropping a bag of marbles. After a game, everybody scatters." 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser says that Lasorda's style hasn't changed over the years. He says 
Lasorda still manages with his heart, not by the book. He also thinks Lasorda 
has been able to adopt to the times. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is not a person who is getting older and is losing touch with the 
modern-day player, understanding the egos and the salaries," Hershiser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Lasorda likes to be surrounded by his former players, as was the case 
recently at an awards banquet for the Dodgers' baseball fantasy camp. Sitting 
at his corner table in the dining room at Dodgertown, Lasorda called out to 
Davey Lopes to join him and Russell. Later, Burt Hooton joined in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ask these guys if I have changed," Lasorda says.  
</P>
<P>
 "Well, his clothes are better now," Hooton says. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's fatter now," Russell says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda often jokes with Russell about taking his job, but he says he really 
isn't giving it much thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want Russell to be the next manager," Lasorda said, "but it doesn't bother 
me that he's here. I wanted him to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of change doesn't appear to be on O'Malley's mind, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's time to search for Tommy's successor, the search will be far and 
wide," O'Malley said. "Yes, it's proper to promote from within. But the search 
will be extensive, the search has not begun. All corners of the earth will be 
searched. But it has not yet begun." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda's favorite activities when he was a youngster in Norristown, Pa., were 
fighting and playing baseball. If he heard there was a tough guy somewhere, he 
would seek him out. 
</P>
<P>
 "And he never lost," said his brother, Morris. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Sam, never understood why Tom couldn't be more like his older 
brother, Eddy. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad would whip me and and say, 'Why? Why? Look at Eddy, he's never a 
problem. He's good as gold.' And I would say, 'I don't know why.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda's other interest was eating. His mother used to pack him a school 
lunch of 10 sandwiches, a banana and a Tasty Cake pie, and he would eat three 
sandwiches on the way to classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father took me to the doctor because he thought I had tapeworm," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda remembers a history teacher walking by his desk and smelling the fried 
pepper and egg sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would say, 'My God, what do you have in that lunch?' " Lasorda recalled. 
"And I would say, 'I would give you one, but I'm sorry, I can't. I only have 
10.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda was the second oldest of five brothers who lived in a row-like house 
in an Italian-American section of Norristown. He was hot tempered, moody and 
the most aggressive brother, said Rosalie Volpe, whose house was joined with 
the Lasordas'. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our families were very close, and you could hear everything through the 
walls," Volpe said. "Tommy was always ready to fight for the boys, in honor of 
the brothers. I think he will always be hot tempered, because that is his mold. 
</P>
<P>
 "His whole life was centered around baseball, he would sneak off to play 
baseball instead of doing his chores. He liked to be out with the people and be 
the center of attention, just like now." 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as school let out for the summer, Lasorda said his mother would shake 
him out of bed and order him to find work. He did anything he could find, 
including working as a bellhop for $7 a week plus tips and laying track for the 
Pennsylvania railroad, earning $5.50 for a 10-hour day's work. But there was 
one job he remembers with disdain. Every Saturday at5 a.m. he would go to the 
house of a man who sold bags of potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I would go over there, he would be eating breakfast, eggs, 
potatoes, toast, and he would never offer me anything," Lasorda said. "He would 
make me just sit and wait for him. Then, as soon as the light came up, we would 
start knocking on doors, trying to sell 100-pound bags of potatoes for $1 a 
bag. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would carry the bags from the cellar of (the) house to the truck, and then, 
carry them to the people's house. We sold until it got dark, then anything left 
over, I had to carry back down to the cellar. And at the end of the day, he 
gave me $1. He was so tight." 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda doesn't have to worry about money anymore. He makes more than 100 
speeches a year, more than half for charity, the others paying him from $10,000 
to $15,000 each. His salary is reported to be more than $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Now when he returns to Norristown it is strictly for fun. 
</P>
<P>
 One sweltering day in Philadelphia, Lasorda, riding in the front seat of a car 
with his brother, Harry, nodded off for about 10 minutes halfway through the 
drive from the team hotel to the family restaurant in the Marchwood Shopping 
Center in Exton, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant, run by his brothers, Harry, Morris, Smokey and Eddy, is 
Lasorda's hangout whenever the team comes to Philadelphia. There, they make him 
a meal of greens and beans -- his favorite. There, locals come for autographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda opened the back door to the kitchen and greeted the cooks and workers 
before making the entrance to the dining area. They continued their work, as 
usual, because there is nothing unusual about Lasorda's presence. The locals, 
spotting Lasorda, walk up to him and form a line, holding their baseball cards 
and pens. Lasorda asks if a bus just pulled up. 
</P>
<P>
 A man approaches with 40 baseball cards. "40 cards?" Lasorda yells. "Are you 
crazy?" The man gets offended and retreats. But about 20 minutes later, Lasorda 
yells across the room and asks the man to bring some of those cards back, but 
not all 40. The man is still upset and sends his son over. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Piazza, father of Mike, the Dodgers catcher, and Lasorda's best friend, 
shows up. He is very late. Lasorda can't believe it. What could have taken him 
so long, he asks Vince over and over. And where's Mike? 
</P>
<P>
 The phone rings in the kitchen, and it's Russell calling from California. 
Having played for Lasorda for 17 seasons, he knows exactly where to find him. 
Russell does a play-by-play of what just happened, what everybody ate, and 
Lasorda's last words when he leaves the restaurant: "Morris, don't forget to 
bring the food to the park. Don't forget the greens." 
</P>
<P>
 Bingo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent trip to give a speech for charity in Nashville, Tenn., Lasorda 
settled into the plush leather seats of a private Lear jet. One of the pilots 
came back and asked him if he wanted anything, saying the plane was equipped 
with everything, except for food. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I don't want anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda put on his reading glasses and canvassed the sports sections of 
several newspapers, occasionally rubbing his sore knees, which were bothering 
him after he played first base for 10 innings in a fantasy camp game. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we get there, I want to drop by and see the nuns, the Sisters of Mercy," 
Lasorda said. "We helped build them a new convent through some fund-raisers, 
and got them out of a place that was condemned. They had no place to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda looks out the window as the jet taxied to a stop. John Hobbs, a friend 
who had arranged for Lasorda to speak that night at an Old-Timer's Baseball 
Banquet, is standing on the Tarmac to greet him. 
</P>
<P>
 He is leaning against a limo. Lasorda smiled.

MIKE DOWNEY: '94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; ITALY HAS NO LUCK AT STOPPING 
THE PUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hockey game here at the Great Eastern Forum was, oh, only four minutes 
old, but already I was humming, "Na na na na. Na na na na. Hey, hey, hey. 
Arrivederci ." 
</P>
<P>
 USA 7, Italy uno. 
</P>
<P>
 Team Italia's goaltender, David (Do I Believe in Miracles? No, I Believe in 
Getting My Butt Back to the Bench Where It's Safe) Delfino, was out there doing 
his remarkably realistic impersonation of the Holland tunnel. About the third 
time one of the United States' shots went through his wickets like a croquet 
ball, the Italian coach whispered into the ear hole of David's goalie mask, 
"Psst. You're supposed to keep your legs closed ." 
</P>
<P>
 Italia, I tell ya. Not much in the ol' puck-stoppage department. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after Delfino was told to take the rest of the day off and his relief 
netminder, Bruno Campese, came in to blow the save, I sensed that the Americans 
had not, with this easy victory here in ice land, given a sound thrashing to 
the NHL's version of a Dream Team. Matter of fact, I've got 10 kroner in my 
pocket that says Jordan, Johnson, Barkley, Ewing, Robinson and Bird could whip 
the Italian hockey team themselves, by maybe, say, 6-1. Bird could sprawl in 
the goal crease on his tummy and stop more pucks than Delfino and Campese. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble is, a tougher foe awaits the men on skates for the States. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the Big Blue Machine. 
</P>
<P>
 The new bad boys of the rink. 
</P>
<P>
 The Finland Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 With a game to be played Wednesday that worries him plenty, the U.S. coach, 
Tim Taylor, said after Monday night's game, "It's a little bit of a David and 
Goliath story." 
</P>
<P>
 This quote was passed along to Garth Snow, who is one of the American goalies 
and not the guy Dana Carvey played in those "Wayne's World" films.  
</P>
<P>
 Snow said, "Who's David and who's Goliath?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ah. Good question. 
</P>
<P>
 See, neither Garth nor I thought we would ever come to a Winter Olympics where 
we would hear anybody referring to Finland as Goliath. I have been following 
international sports for a long time and, to be painfully candid, I've never 
even heard anybody refer to Finland as David. We don't do a whole lot of 
referring to Finland in general, frankly.  
</P>
<P>
 For some reason, however, nobody noticed before this particular Olympics that 
when none of us was looking, Finland put together one pretty darn fine hockey 
club. I'm not sure how this happened. Somebody over there at Helsinki Square 
Garden really did his homework.  
</P>
<P>
 Here in Lillehammer, the first nine days of the hockey competition produced 
one major surprise, that being everybody who got in the Finns' path being 
absolutely Zamboni'd. I mean, these guys beat the Russians the way the Russians 
used to beat Belgium. It wasn't even close. That red light went on so often 
behind the Russian goalie, he thought he'd been pulled over. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Finnish coach has been going around crowing how he's got the finest 
team in the tournament. He's done everything but say, "Put it in three-inch 
type. We will win the Olympics!" 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor didn't exactly wave the white flag of surrender. He waved a red, white 
and blue flag. He said something like, you know, we've done it before, we can 
do it again.  
</P>
<P>
 He understated the situation, though, when he said: "They've dominated all 
their opponents. You have to give him bragging rights so far. His team's been 
the dominant team from the start." 
</P>
<P>
 And here's something for you folks with short attention spans. 
</P>
<P>
 Our 1980 USA miracle hockey team did not defeat Russia to win the gold medal. 
Our 1980 USA miracle hockey team defeated Finland to win the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 The date was Feb. 24, the place Lake Placid and the score 2-1 after two 
periods, in favor of the Finns. How soon we forget. The game against Russia -- 
excuse me, the USSR -- was played on a Friday afternoon, 5 o'clock, two days 
before. The American public still had to sweat out that Sunday matinee, which 
wasn't in the bag until Phil Verchota, Rob McClanahan and Mark Johnson slapped 
shots past Finland's goalie for a 4-2 victory to remember. (Or to forget, as 
many have.) Poor Finland suffered so much from that defeat, it didn't even win 
a medal. It placed fourth.  
</P>
<P>
 Second at Calgary in 1988, the Finns slipped to seventh place four years later 
at Albertville. But they are back , believe me. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though the Americans looked pretty slick in their latest game, what 
with Peter Ciavaglia, Peter Ferraro and David Sacco peppering that poor Italian 
goalie until he was given the hook, I'm not sure that their defeating Finland 
this Wednesday wouldn't be right up there with that 1980 game. Not in impact, I 
suppose, but in Great Upsets of Olympic Hockey history, yes. 
</P>
<P>
 What can I say? 
</P>
<P>
 We're not Goliath, Garth. Taylor, the coach, said: "Our guys have to get their 
chests out and their American pride up." 
</P>
<P>
 And keep their legs closed.

JIM MURRAY: IS L.A. TOO WIMPY TO BUILD NEW STADIUM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm worried about L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, no, it's not the earthquakes, the floods, the droughts, the fires, the 
riots. It's its soul I'm concerned about. It has lost it. 
</P>
<P>
 You know what kind of town this used to be? It was a shoot-the-moon town. Bet 
the ace. Call for cards. You're faded, buddy. Who says it can't be done? Get 
him outta here! 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way it was. You know, this is the town that built the Coliseum, the 
Rose Bowl, the first freeways, the movie business. This was the town that 
brought the Olympics to America in an era of worldwide Depression, when the 
whole world was broke. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a place that got things done. This is the place that, so to speak, 
made pro football, saved major league baseball, put pro golf on the map when it 
comes to that.  
</P>
<P>
 It had its naysayers, but L.A. laughed at them. Told them to shut up and deal. 
If they didn't want to sit in, drop out. Fold. We're busy here, don't 
interrupt.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, when the rest of the world found the Olympics too expensive and the 
Games were in danger of extinction, L.A. picked them up, dusted them off and 
took them again.  
</P>
<P>
 City Hall shook in its boots. So did all the wimpy politicians. They got 
hysterical and passed legislation that banned the expenditure of even one 
dollar to accommodate the Games. So, Peter Ueberroth said OK and rolled up his 
sleeves -- and made $200 million on the Games and turned a lot of it over to 
the city.  
</P>
<P>
 We got the Rams here over the combined opposition of the colleges, the 
community penny-pinchers and, in some cases, pro football itself. They still 
thought this was Fort Apache out here. Only Charlie Chaplin and a few palm 
trees.  
</P>
<P>
 We went after the Dodgers over opposition just as furious -- so furious they 
put a referendum on the ballot forbidding it. 
</P>
<P>
 We had guts, we had drive, we had vision. L.A. always just did it. They 
brought the water here in the early part of the century or L.A. wouldn't even 
be here. But nowadays some guy reviles the man who brought it here in print and 
film -- as he sits by his swimming pool and turns his sprinklers on.  
</P>
<P>
 We're in an era of headlong wimpdom today -- sometimes referred to as 
"political correctness" but more like political ineptness. Good Lord, even 
Christopher Columbus gets dumped on -- by people who would be stomping grapes 
or picking tarantulas off banana bunches if he didn't have the guts to sail off 
to the end of the world in the first place.  
</P>
<P>
 We're scared to death of our lawyers and witless activists who know how to 
manipulate the system to promote their own agenda, which is frequently such a 
paranoid suspicion of the Establishment that it's a wonder they don't put a 
straitjacket on government altogether. We are afflicted with what I think of as 
a kind of "soup kitchen mentality." 
</P>
<P>
 Look, we need a stadium. That rotting pile of urine-stenched old stones out in 
Exposition Park has gotten hardening of the arteries. It's a municipal 
disgrace.  
</P>
<P>
 Don't take my word for it. The teams we lured to L.A. in the first place are 
now packing to leave. The best guess is, either the Rams or the Raiders will 
decamp shortly. Take their football and move to a place where the ballpark is 
new and state of the art and the revenue is a guaranteed sellout for 15 years 
no matter what kind of team you put on the field. The prospects are unlimited. 
L.A. is now in danger of becoming that municipal horror, a nice place to be 
from . 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I'm not advocating putting the taxpayers into hopeless hock to put up a 
place to play. On the other hand, how did they manage to build two stadiums 
(Coliseum and Rose Bowl) in the '20s? And what have they meant to L.A.? Two 
Olympics, World Series, Super Bowls, World Cup. Visit from the Pope. Title 
fights. USC-Notre Dame games.  
</P>
<P>
 You think the politicians who pushed those edifices through have to apologize 
to anybody? The only thing they did wrong was leave the running of them to 
bureaucrats and politicians.  
</P>
<P>
 I am sure there are entrepreneurs out there who are willing and able to do 
what their predecessors did 70-odd years ago -- get a community center. Get a 
heart to Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 But in an age full of people who might have gotten a restraining order against 
Columbus leaving Genoa, who's going to stick his neck out? 
</P>
<P>
 He would need civic cooperation. Remember the city deeded over some hundreds 
of acres of Chavez Ravine to the Dodgers' Walter O'Malley in an admittedly 
one-sided exchange for Wrigley Field. But the cynics prophesied he would soon 
convert the land instead to more-profitable uses, condos and hotels. Well, 
Dodger Stadium is still there and the guess here is that if the stadium deal 
had been blocked, there would be gambling casinos there today.  
</P>
<P>
 I remember, in a hotel in Moscow in 1980, I was with John Argue, one of the 
moving forces in getting the '84 Olympics here, and John asked me what I 
thought the outlook was. I remember saying, "John, if L.A. can't put on a track 
meet, we are in a whole bunch of trouble." 
</P>

 We're getting so we can't put on a track meet. If pro football reverses the 
trend of past decades and goes out of L.A., it's not because pro football has 
changed, it's because L.A. has. We don't have any fun anymore. We're in thrall 
to a lot of guys who, if they were around to prevail in the '20s, the Dodgers 
would still be in Brooklyn, the Rams in Cleveland and the Olympic Games in 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 The common plea in these parts used to be, "O give us men to match our 
mountains!" Now, we got men to match our geraniums.

 Hall of Famer Ted Williams had a minor stroke at his home during the weekend 
that weakened his vision and the left side of his body, a hospital spokesman 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 75, was in fair condition at Shands Hospital, where he was treated 
two years ago after a mild stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just down talking to him and he's very awake and alert," a hospital 
spokesman said. "He is in fair condition. He is doing well for someone who's 
had a stroke. All his indicators are favorable for recovery."

WHITE SOX RELIEVER RADINSKY IS EXAMINED FOR GROWTH ON NECK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Radinsky, Chicago White Sox relief pitcher, has a growth on the left 
side of his neck and has undergone tests in California and Florida to determine 
its nature, the team said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of the tests and further details regarding Scott's condition will be 
released in the next few days, the team said.Officials said no further comments 
would be made until then. 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky, 25, made a career-high 73 appearances last season with the White 
Sox, going 8-2 with a 4.28 ERA and four saves. Still, he pitched only 54 2/3 
innings in 1993. The left-hander has averaged 68 appearances in his four 
seasons in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known for a few days and it hasn't sunk in," Chicago pitcher Jack 
McDowell said. "It's something you can't prepare for. Everybody is pulling for 
him. We know how tough and strong he is. If anybody can deal with or have to 
deal with it, he would be the one to be able to come through on top." 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky graduated from Simi Valley High in 1986 where he struck out 180 
batters in 100 innings during his senior season.

'94 WINTER LILLEHAMMER OLYMPICS; LOOK WHO'S WANTED; INTEREST IN HIRING U.S. SKI 
STAFF INCREASES AFTER AMERICANS' SUCCESSFUL FIRST WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 America, hide your ski coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after the U.S. Alpine team was branded "the left-footed snow-plow 
brigade," by Sports Illustrated, top European ski countries reportedly are 
wooing top American ski team staffers. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team, in a reversal of fortunes, has already won four medals in 
skiing -- more than traditional Alpine powers Austria, Switzerland and France 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
 "Funny how it changes things," said Howard Peterson, the outgoing CEO of U.S. 
Skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson said that a Swiss counterpart, whom he would not name, has inquired 
about obtaining the services of U.S. men's coach Ueli Luthi. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't even know what Ueli does," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazing what four medals in five events will do for a couple of reputations. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson was the man held most accountable for U.S. skiing woes in the recent 
Sports Illustrated article. And now even he is beating away offers from the 
Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two countries who want to hire me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson declined to name the countries. He took over as head of U.S. Skiing 
six years ago but was replaced last fall by Mike Jacki. Peterson will continue 
with the team through the spring, easing Jacki's transition. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Major, the U.S. Alpine director, said many of the top Alpine countries 
are in a frenzy over their poor Olympic performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's always going on, especially this time of year," Major said of the 
coach-hunting. "Because the teams that aren't doing well are all nervous, their 
bosses are running around saying, 'Ah, we're going to fire this guy.' It's kind 
of a sad statement, but that's the way it goes." 
</P>
<P>
 Austria and France have yet to win an Alpine medal here. Switzerland won its 
first Monday, when Vreni Schneider took the silver in women's combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Major, also the U.S. women's coach, would not say whether he had received any 
job offers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't tell you if I did," Major said.

DATELINE / LILLEHAMMER; ACCOMMODATIONS ARE PLAINLY NICE 
</P>

<P>
 The sign says "Vormstuen, " and it marks the new apartment complex on the 
outskirts of Lillehammer where many of the 8,000 journalists are staying while 
covering the Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 New, but hardly plush. In fact, the word utilitarian springs directly to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The building housing Times troops is typical. There are three bedrooms and two 
bathrooms downstairs, four bedrooms and two bathrooms up, a small common area 
on each floor. Decor is stark white, unpainted wallboard. Each room includes an 
army-style bunk, a desk with clamp-on lamp, a small bookcase, a chair and a 
free-standing metal closet. 
</P>
<P>
 There is electric heat, with a control knob, praise be, in each room. There 
also is a framed crayon drawing with an Olympic theme, courtesy of the 
schoolkids of Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 The seasoned European traveler soon learns not to expect shower curtains 
around the tub area. Here, though, they have reversed that concept. There are 
shower curtains, but no tubs. The shower head is mounted, but can be snapped 
off and hand-held in a corner of the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no real shower stall, only the curtain and bare floor with a drain 
covered by a hard-on-the feet plastic grid. A long-handled squeegee is provided 
in each bathroom and the bather is expected to tidy up the place after his 
shower. 
</P>
<P>
 Downstairs, the common area is comfortable -- short couches facing one another 
across a coffee table. Upstairs, for some reason, the lone couch faces across 
the coffee table to a stunning view of the bathroom doors, scant feet away. Oh, 
well, nobody said it would be perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the digs aren't bad. The rooms are warm, the bunks comfortable. 
There are no blankets, just a great comforter that could warm even an editor's 
cold, cold heart. There are clean towels every day -- bring your own washcloth 
-- and clean bed linens every other day. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Olympics are over, some of the units will remain here as housing for 
students at a school, which is what the main press center -- up the hill, over 
the bridge and through the tunnel from Vormstuen -- is scheduled to become. 
Some other units will be taken apart and shipped to other parts of the country, 
there to be reassembled and used as housing at other schools. 
</P>
<P>
 As cold as the nights are here, let's hope everybody is issued a comforter.

 Two exercise riders were hurt, one critically, and one horse was killed in two 
unrelated accidents at Gulfstream Park on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Rafferty, 42, was exercising Vindication when the 4-year-old filly 
suffered a broken left front leg and collapsed. Rafferty was rushed to 
Hollywood Memorial Hospital, where she was in critical condition with a broken 
back. Vindication was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 One hour later, Kelly Allen, 23, was jogging Medical Pro when the horse bolted 
and collided with another horse. Allen, 23, was treated and released at 
Aventura Medical Hospital.

BOYER FINALLY TAKES HIS CELEBRATION OF LIFE ONTO THE COURT; BASKETBALL: IT TOOK 
HIM YEARS TO GET OVER THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER. NOW, THE SENIOR IS A BIG PART OF 
THE ANTEATERS' FRONT LINE.

 Groves of eucalyptus wave in the breeze above his head, but UC Irvine students 
have no trouble seeing DeForrest for the trees. DeForrest Boyer requested 
before the season that he be referred to by his entire first name, but most of 
his fans can't seem to break old habits. They still smile and say, "Yo, Dee," 
as he strolls across campus. 
</P>
<P>
 On or off the court, the senior center seldom is lost in a crowd. He's 6 feet 
10 and somewhere around 285 pounds, depending on the results of his latest fad 
diet. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer has learned to make optimum use of his bulk, however, literally throwing 
his weight around to his advantage on the court. But he will never forget the 
day he thought he wasn't big enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer was 9 years old when he was riding behind his father during a test drive 
of a new motor scooter, purchased that day for Boyer's older brother, Harvey 
Jr. They swerved to avoid an oncoming car and ran into a parked car. 
</P>
<P>
 DeForrest split his lip. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Boyer suffered internal injuries that resulted in his death two months 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was trying to brace me and he fell off and then the motorcycle fell on top 
of him," Boyer said. "I was just too little to hold it up. I couldn't get it 
off him." 
</P>
<P>
 The weight of the motor scooter did not injure the elder Boyer, but the image 
of him laying there will never fade for his son. The handlebars had jammed into 
his father's midsection at impact, damaging his liver and pancreas. For two 
months, Boyer was hospitalized while doctors decided how best to repair the 
injuries. He didn't survive the initial surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a devastating blow for DeForrest, who viewed his 6-6, 305-pound Marine 
sergeant father as bigger than life, invincible. The shock was compounded by 
the fact that he had visited his father every day between the accident and his 
death. Harvey Sr. was telling his older son to prepare to become the man of his 
family, but he was keeping up a cheerful front for his youngest son. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day, the whole family, my aunts and uncles and all, would get in the 
car and drive down to the (military) hospital in San Diego to see him," Boyer 
said. "He was usually joking with us and saying he was getting better. I never 
thought he would die." 
</P>
<P>
 After his father's death, the grief clung to DeForrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was harder on Dee than it was on me," said Harvey Jr., who lives 
with his mother, Clyde, in Las Vegas. "I mean it definitely changed my life. I 
was 17 and I had to grow up a lot faster. I felt like I had to look after my 
mom and my brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were so many responsibilities and so much to do, I was busy. But Dee 
was there when it happened, and he's the baby and he was always a little 
spoiled, so he took it really hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde Boyer had lost her mother when she was only 15, so she knew what her 
sons were going through. She also knew she could do little to assuage their 
sense of loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understood the pain and the anger that they felt," she said. "And for Dee, 
to lose someone you love at that age and have to face growing up without a 
father, it was very hard." 
</P>
<P>
 The two months of hospital visits had drawn an already close family into a 
tighter knit. And for DeForrest, it merely amplified the sense of void when his 
father was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have any contact with my friends for a long, long time," he said. 
"It was always just my family, and our family life was so different without my 
father. He was very strict and had the meanest streak you would ever want to 
see. But he would also joke a lot and was really fun to be around. 
</P>
<P>
 "In high school, and even at times at Saddleback (College), I would just sit 
and cry some nights. But in the last couple of years, I've decided that's not 
what my father would want. He never let us see him cry and he wouldn't want me 
wasting my time crying. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would tell me to rejoice in what we had and do something good with my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 For Boyer, exultation too often involves revelry at mealtime. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently took a hungry-man-sized bite out of a submarine sandwich -- 
turkey, avocado and sprouts on wheat -- chewed thoughtfully for a minute and 
managed a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, it's a constant battle with me," he said. "It's not like I eat the 
wrong foods or anything. I mean I can eat salads all day long and still gain 
the weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's the dressing, because I'll pile on the dressing." 
</P>
<P>
 He has tried lots of diets, although the lots-of-salad-with-lots-of-dressing 
regimen is clearly his favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of (diets) work for a while, but then all of sudden you just find 
yourself with a hamburger and fries," he said. "And once you do that, you end 
up going back for more. I get down to a certain weight and then it just seems 
to pile right back on. I just can't keep it off." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been that way for as long as his mother can remember. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was nine pounds 13 ounces when he was born and he's had to fight gaining 
weight ever since," she said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine assistant Tim Murphy thinks a little discipline at the dining table 
could have meant a lot of money for Boyer. Big men can make big bucks overseas. 
Murphy's brother, Tod, a former Irvine standout who has played in Europe, the 
CBA and the NBA, is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
 "People with weight problems always want to be lighter, but I feel I can play 
well at this weight," Boyer said. "Of course the coaches say I'd be even better 
with less weight. I mean, I think so, too, but it's hard, man." 
</P>
<P>
 He sometimes seems more like a huge Pillsbury Doughboy than King Kong of the 
Court, but Boyer is an impact player for the Anteaters. He's shooting 65% from 
the floor overall and 69% in the Big West. He's averaging 12.2 points, 6.9 
rebounds and is third in the conference with 32 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dee has very soft hands and a great touch," Coach Rod Baker said. "And he's 
not a good passer, he's a great passer. He doesn't have great footwork and his 
lower-body strength isn't that good, which hurts his balance." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer suffers from tendinitis in both knees and has had his right leg wrapped 
from ankle to thigh since he strained muscles against Cal State Fullerton in 
the Big West opener Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 The leg is healing, however, and lately, Boyer has been racing up and down the 
court on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people witness a full eclipse," Baker said. "You've seen Dee sprint." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Anteaters manage to get the ball inside to Boyer, good things usually 
happen. But if the defense collapses a little and conditions are not just 
right, Boyer seldom tries to force the action. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last eight games, Boyer has made 35 of 42 shots. In the last four, he 
has made 17 of 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Boyer should shoot more? 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the guy who understands how well he's being guarded," Baker said, "where 
he is on the floor, where the defenders are and what they're capable of. You 
just can't force a guy to shoot if he doesn't want to." 
</P>
<P>
 With most basketball players, this is not a problem. But Boyer isn't the kind 
to assert himself into situations he can't control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not the greatest-skilled offensive player and my shot opportunities have 
to come through the offense," he said. "The fans might think I'm really hot and 
should shoot more, but I'm not Shaq or whatever. I'm human. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are times when I'm in the groove and I want the ball because I know I 
can score. Everybody forces shots sometimes. I do. And it's usually because 
you're frustrated or you feel like you're not picking up your slack for the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to shoot two or three 15-footers every game instead of having to 
battle it out in the post for every shot, but I'm not going to step outside my 
role." 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde Boyer will have one more chance to play the role of proud mom this 
season. The Big West tournament is scheduled March 10-13 in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 But no dunk or jump hook will make her as proud as she will be the day he 
graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer will need to complete one more quarter next fall to get his degree in 
criminology. He hopes to get a job as a probation officer or as an agent for 
the Drug Enforcement Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "He especially likes working with children," his mother said. "I think he 
would make a great probation officer. Kids have always looked up to him." 
</P>
<P>
 But then who doesn't?

 DANGER LURKING: The two-week-long Festival of Whales in Dana Point begins 
Friday night with a talk at Dana Point High School by Peter Burtchell of the 
Cousteau Society (B2). But he won't be talking about whales. . . . Burtchell 
says he will discuss threats to the world's oceans with emphasis on Haiti, 
which he says is a microcosm of world problems. Says Burtchell: "What you have 
there is an ever-growing population desperately trying to feed itself with 
ever-dwindling resources, like our planet in general. Haiti is a wake-up call 
for all of us."

 HONORING ROBB: When 26-year-old Saddleback College student Robb Nimmo died of 
AIDS in 1986, the disease "wasn't a household word," says his sister, Heidi. 
She and her mother and brother recently established a $40,000 perpetual 
scholarship at Saddleback to honor Nimmo, who was active in theater there -- 
his last performance when he was battling AIDS. . . . "He always thought of 
Saddleback as his home," his sister says. "He felt good about this campus; we 
think this is a great way to honor him."

 ANY AGE OK: It's no surprise what feminist leader Betty Friedan's topic will 
be when she speaks to Women in Business Orange County on Thursday at Le 
Meridien Hotel in Newport Beach. Friedan's latest book is "The Fountain of 
Age," about growing old. Says group spokeswoman Terri Baas: "She's going to 
tell us that it's OK to get old and still use your talent. But we've had her 
speak before. She ignites the women whatever she says." 
</P>
<P>
 DOWN UNDER BLUES: This may be small consolation, but things aren't much better 
in Australia than they are here. Five Australian city officials have just 
completed two weeks in Orange and Los Angeles counties, taking a look at how 
they might improve government efficiency Down Under. And what did they learn? 
Terry Barnes, general manager of Fairfield in New South Wales, says his people 
need "more innovation, downsizing and more technology." And his comparison of 
the two countries: "We both face financial difficulties."

 HOT PROPERTY: Safe cities and cleaner air are among the reasons Ventura County 
is such a desirable place to buy a home. . . . "I think Ventura County has 
always been a great place to live, and it continues to be very popular," said 
Mary Hall, president-elect of the Conejo Valley Board of Realtors. . . .

 BIG TOP: Fillmore merchants displaced by last month's earthquake are scheduled 
this week to move into a big tent erected in a downtown park. The tent will 
house 11 merchants until they can rebuild or relocate. But that may take 
awhile. . . . It took three years to relocate businesses housed in tents after 
a 1989 earthquake ravaged Santa Cruz. "We look back and laugh that we thought 
it might take six months or even a year," said Patricia Calvert of Santa Cruz's 
downtown association. "And there's still a lot of people struggling."

 PRIVATE LESSONS: There is no marching band or Friday night football at La 
Reina High School in Thousand Oaks. Just a no-nonsense approach to discipline

third mock trial championship. . . . "You can become something here, where you

 RADIO WAVES: A radio campaign, airing on 22 stations statewide, including 
Oxnard-based KCAQ, is trying to reach young adults in need of advice and care 
on family planning matters. . . . "The campaign lets people know that there is 
a caring, low-cost, confidential resource that can help them prevent 
unintentional pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases," said Lynne 
Barnett of the state Office of Family Planning. . . . Since the radio spots 
started airing earlier this month, more than 1,200 calls a week have come in to 
the office's toll-free information line. Owner-Occupied

<P>
 Two unarmed security guards in Orange County were shot to death within two 
hours, and investigators are trying to determine if the slayings were linked. 
</P>
<P>
 Dagoberto R. Carrero, 23, of Orange died after an 11:05 p.m. Sunday shooting 
at the Century Theater Complex at City Shopping Center, said Orange Police Lt. 
Timm Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said Carrero had confronted six teen-agers earlier in the day about 
sneaking into the theater for a 5:15 p.m. showing of "Addams Family Values," 
and one of them had threatened him. Police were searching for the teen-agers 
for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrero was shot through a lobby window as he prepared to head home to his 
wife and 9-month-old daughter, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Garden Grove, Rupert Morales, 19, of Santa Ana, was shot several times in 
the parking lot of Nick's Hide Away bar at 12:50 a.m. Monday, said Garden Grove 
Police Sgt. Joe Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales also was an unarmed security officer, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were looking into a possible connection between the two killings, but 
had no facts to support a link, Johnson said.

 Five people were reported killed in a clash between northern and southern 
Yemeni forces that threatened to undermine a day-old reconciliation accord. It 
was the first fatal clash between the two armies since a leadership crisis 
began six months ago.A reconciliation and reform charter was signed just a day 
earlier in Amman, Jordan. Sources in Sana, the capital, said about 150 northern 
Amalqa Brigade troops besieged government offices in Abyan, 200 miles south of 
Sana, after reports that the provincial governor, a northerner, was replaced by 
a southerner. They said south Yemeni troops, backed by tanks, fought with the 
group, leaving five dead. They did not know which side suffered the casualties. 
Defense Minister Haithem Qassem, a southerner, said in Aden that the dust-up 
occurred when Amalqa Brigade troops "provocatively deployed" and cut off troops 
of the southern Madra Brigade trying to return to barracks.

 Where can a town of about 300 throw a birthday bash attracting up to 1,500 
people? On President's Day, it's none other than George, Washington. This dusty 
town in the central part of the state has thrown a party on the holiday -- 
originally Washington's Birthday -- since it was founded 37 years ago.What 
better place to do it? "This is the only town in the United States that can 
wear the full name of a president, at least as of yet," said Merna Lutz, one of 
the Georgettes, a women's community group that organizes the party. Lutz 
watched on July 4, 1957, when George founder Charlie Brown dedicated the town's 
first plot. Then-Gov. Albert Rosellini came to George to plant the first cherry 
tree, establishing a tradition for each new landowner.

THOUSANDS IN COUNTY MARK PRESIDENTS' DAY IN THE SUN; HOLIDAY: RESIDENTS TAKE TO 
THE BEACHES, PARKS AND MALLS UNDER CLEARING SKIES. REAGAN LIBRARY HOLDS 
PRESIDENTIAL LOOK-ALIKE CONTEST AND TURN-OF-THE-CENTURY FAIR.

<P>
 From Simi Valley to the Ventura shore, thousands of county residents made 
their way outdoors Monday to celebrate Presidents' Day and take advantage of 
the spring-like weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks, shopping malls, beaches and other public gathering places were packed 
as people across the county sought to make up for a holiday weekend that 
started out cold and wet. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library opened the museum doors 
for free Monday, holding a Presidents' Day bash fit for voters, taxpayers, and 
heads of state and household. 
</P>
<P>
 Would-be thespians competed in a presidential look-alike contest. The close 
match was won by Jay Koch of Port Hueneme, who so resembles Reagan that, he 
said, he once portrayed the former President in a Hollywood comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking the courtyard under mostly sunny skies, the director of the library 
foundation welcomed many of the visitors Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What better way to spend Presidents' Day than with the Presidents?" director 
Richard Norton Smith asked. "This is very much in keeping with what (the 
Reagans) want for the library." 
</P>
<P>
 For a few hours, the museum courtyard was transformed into a 
turn-of-the-century country fair, complete with an old-time band, living images 
of Presidents past, and free cake and cotton candy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's cool," said 10-year-old Bethany Hale of Simi Valley. "They have 
all the Presidents and people dressed up in old clothes. I didn't know Teddy 
Roosevelt was so fat." 
</P>
<P>
 Bethany's father, Marlund Hale, said the Reagan Library was an ideal spot to 
take his daughter on Presidents' Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great community resource," the environmental engineer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the Ventura County coast, where winds were gusting up to 25 m.p.h. 
Monday afternoon, colorful kites competed for airspace. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura resident Terrell Cryer clenched the reins of a multicolored stunt 
kite, sending it diving and climbing above the white sand of Marina Cove Beach. 
Like dozens of others, the commercial fisherman took advantage of a dry but 
wind-whipped day. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like a very beginning one," he said of the kite, which he received 
for Christmas. "There are some of these kites that will lift you right off the 
ground." 
</P>
<P>
 A short walk down the beach, Hollen Baker was carving trails in the sand with 
the heels of his feet. Gripping the handles of a high-performance stunt kite, 
Baker skied on the sand as his toy zipped and danced through the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a wind junkie," Rubin Rubio said of his son as he watched the kite drag 
Baker all over the beach. "He's addicted to stunt kites." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubio and Baker are from Canoga Park, where there is little room to fly kites. 
At Marina Cove Beach, they set up a wind sock and set out to fly an assortment 
of kites. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard in the city," Rubio said of the limited space and the other 
distractions. "Here, we can have good, clean fun." 
</P>
<P>
 At Oxnard State Beach, the fun wasn't so clean. 
</P>
<P>
 The first couple of times that 5-year-old Kelli Johnston tried to fly a kite 
by herself, she was pulled to the ground and muddied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to do it again," she told her parents, Bill and Sheri Johnston of 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 She got up and tried again. This time, even as the kite threatened to lift her 
off the ground, Kelli held tight and flew it by herself. Her parents stood back 
and watched their daughter on the green park lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot harder than it looks," Sheri Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
 At The Oaks mall in Thousand Oaks, shoppers crowded the stores and aisles, 
lined up for the ATM machine, and waited for tables at Sweeney's and other 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they're celebrating Presidents' Day; they just want the sales," 
said Tami Decker, a waitress at Sweeney's who spent her holiday bustling from 
table to table. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since the earthquake, people don't have anywhere else to go," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Upstairs, Diana Hayden was taking a break on a wooden bench overlooking the 
crowds. "I just wanted to get out of the house, get a change of scenery," she 
said while eating a chicken sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might do a little shopping," Hayden added between bites. "My niece has a 
birthday coming up." 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures in the upper 60s lured hundreds of people to Conejo Creek Park, 
where families ate hand-packed picnics and children played on jungle gyms and 
other playground equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Two mothers from Newbury Park sat perched a few yards from their children, who 
were busy amusing themselves on a swing set built for four. 
</P>
<P>
 "In school (today), they're going to make hoecakes, because that's what George 
Washington ate," said Cheri Kruger, when asked what Presidents' Day meant to 
her family. "I learned that from my 7-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
 Six-year-old Casey Troulman said she recently has become an authority on 
Abraham Lincoln. "I didn't learn anything about George Washington," she said. 
"My teacher just talked about Abraham Lincoln." 
</P>
<P>
 Her brother, Aaron Troulman, 9, had no doubt about what he liked best about 
Presidents' Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get the day off," he said. "I like that."

DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE FACES TRADITION OF STRUGGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hank Starr had never considered running for public office. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Democratic Party officials called the 60-year-old attorney from Bell 
Canyon in 1992 to ask if he would challenge then-Assemblywoman Cathie Wright 
(R-Simi Valley) for a state Senate seat, he knew exactly what to say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'You're crazy, hell no,' " Starr recalled. "And then, I heard this 
little voice that said, 'Jesus Christ, Hank, how often does an opportunity to 
really make a difference arise?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Starr, a political novice, jumped in the race and was promptly beaten by 
Wright, a fierce campaigner and veteran politician backed by hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Starr, who spent more than $35,000 of his own money in the race, was 
determined to make a difference. He later was elected chairman of the 22-member 
Ventura County Democratic Central Committee, whose purpose is to raise money, 
register voters, groom potential candidates and build the party organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I sought to bring was complete organization and professionalism to the 
Democratic Party," he said. "What I accomplished was far more modest." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it has not been an easy job. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic Central Committee has never been able to raise much money in 
Ventura County. As of Dec. 31, it reported a meager $431 in its campaign 
treasury, compared with the more than $10,000 claimed by the Republican Central 
Committee. And unlike the Republicans, the Democratic Central Committee does 
not have its own office, sharing space instead with a Democratic club based in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "To say one is a Democrat is to say one doesn't have money to give to the 
political party. Republicans will put on a $100-a-plate dinner and collect 
thousands. We'll put on a $7.50 barbecue and pay for the food." 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem has been finding viable Democratic candidates to challenge 
Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), Assemblyman Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard) and 
Assemblywoman Paula L. Boland (R-Granada Hills) in the November general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly, whose 23rd Congressional District covers most of Ventura County, has 
amassed more than $120,000 for his reelection campaign, while his two potential 
Democratic challengers acknowledge that they have yet to raise the $1,336 
filing fee to qualify for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr and other Democratic Central Committee members said they know little 
about the two Democrats who have taken out nomination papers. They are Frank 
Stephenson, 53, a college placement consultant from Ojai, and Kevin Ready, 41, 
a Ventura resident and attorney for Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi said he believes that the Democratic Party recruited Dorothy Maron, 
his former nemesis on the Oxnard City Council, to run against him in an act of 
desperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just didn't want me to run uncontested, so they probably went after her, 
and she begrudgingly accepted," said Takasugi, who already has $50,000 in his 
campaign war chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr and Maron both said that was not the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's always been the case," Starr said. "She was not recruited," Starr 
said. "She set out to run, and we encouraged her. She's a viable candidate. 
She's articulate and she's experienced." 
</P>
<P>
 Starr acknowledged that Maron will not have much money for the race, "but then 
Democrats have never outspent Republicans. The only thing we have more of is 
shoe leather and ideals." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Cannon, a longtime Central Committee member, said it is very important 
that the Democratic Party not let congressional and legislative races go 
uncontested. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Takasugi runs uncontested, it means he'll give his money to somebody 
else," Cannon said. "This way, he'll have to spend $100,000 on his own race. It 
keeps the money at home, instead of helping other Republican candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 Starr said the Democratic Central Committee could be much stronger in Ventura 
County if local Democratic legislators worked more closely with the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the professional legislators are deeply concerned that Republicans 
don't get a free ride this year, because they will use their money to help 
others get elected," Starr said. "Perhaps some of those legislators should have 
been down here a long time ago supporting the party so we could have strong 
candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria), who is running for the 18th State 
Senate District seat being vacated by Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara), acknowledged 
that he has had little contact with the Central Committee leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't work as closely as we probably should," said O'Connell, whose 35th 
Assembly District includes portions of western Ventura County. "I can't even 
tell you the last time I spoke to their group." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell said he has a strong campaign organization and therefore has few 
ties to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little more independent," he said. "I think the Central Committee is 
really for helping people get started, but sooner or later, you have to send 
the kid off to college. And then it's 'See you, dude.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, O'Connell added, "it's the Central Committee's role to develop and 
recruit good candidates, not mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Cannon agreed that the role of central committees, whether Republican or 
Democrat, is essentially a weak one because many campaign contributors would 
rather give directly to a candidate than to a political party. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are signs that the Democratic Party in Ventura County is 
maturing, as Starr puts it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last 18 months, two new Democratic clubs have been established, in 
Camarillo and Ventura, and a third will soon be operating in Simi Valley, 
bringing to six the number of community-based clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the future looks very good," said Paul Chapman, another committee 
member and chairman of the countywide club Democrats United. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman said that under Starr's leadership, the committee has become more 
focused and united. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr said the role of central committees will be much greater in the future 
because of term limits, which he said will encourage more grass-roots politics. 
When that happens, he said, candidates will turn to local party organizations 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Starr himself said he has no plans to run for public office 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember, I'm a Democrat," he said. "I've only got so much money."

NEW PARTY LINE; COUNTY'S GOP LEADERSHIP IS FOCUSED ON DRAWING BROAD SUPPORT

 Two years ago, Ventura County's Republican Party Central Committee was 
bankrupt and caught up in a bitter power struggle between moderates and a 
conservative Christian majority bent on promoting its anti-abortion agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 It was enough to get old-guard Republicans like Paul Leavens riled up. 
Leavens, a Ventura rancher, had not served on the committee in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't like the direction the Central Committee was going in -- to the very 
far right -- and losing middle-of-the-road Republicans, particularly women," he 
said. "I got angry and threw my hat in the ring." 
</P>
<P>
 Leavens joined a slate of candidates fielded by the newly formed Committee to 
Elect Responsible Republicans, which succeeded in ousting the Central 
Committee's conservative Christian faction in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've now got what we call a big-tent committee, which welcomes all 
Republicans," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the change in leadership, the 22-member committee has directed its focus 
back on basic party-building functions, such as registering voters, raising 
money and arranging get-out-the-vote efforts on Election Day. The committee 
also endorses candidates -- usually in the GOP primary -- and oversees the 
activities of the various Republican clubs in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very strong now, very united," said Bob Larkin, a Simi Valley insurance 
agent who was elected committee chairman last year. "We've really tried to pull 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most significant changes under Larkin's leadership has been the 
committee's fund-raising success, which he attributed largely to Leavens, the 
finance chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started out with a minus $84 bank account a year ago," Larkin said. "Once 
all the controversy started and got in the papers, the money dried up. People 
don't like to send money into a controversy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, however, the committee collected more than $15,000 in contributions 
and has about the same amount in its treasury this year to boost the campaigns 
of Republican candidates in county, state and national races. Once people 
learned about the new committee leadership, Larkin said, raising money got a 
lot easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "People identified the new committee members as good-quality Republicans who 
were going to use that money to register voters," said Larkin, noting that the 
committee recently hired a full-time fund-raiser. "So the money came in fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Fox, a Ventura attorney appointed to the committee last year, said the 
group's ability to raise money again "is one of the most telling examples of 
how the present incumbent group has turned the committee around." 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to go through a real rebuilding effort because of the events of the 
last two years," he said. "But we're doing very well this year." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to fund raising, the committee is concentrating on recruiting more 
minorities, particularly Latinos and blacks, to the Republican Party. Last 
year, the committee published its brochure in both English and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the party that freed the slaves, and we were the party for equality 
and all those things," said Larkin, whose committee includes one African 
American. "We should really attract Hispanics and blacks. They belong in our 
party and we need to get them." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are other incentives to register minorities. In 1990, Rep. Elton 
Gallegly's 23rd Congressional District was redrawn to include all of Ventura 
County except Thousand Oaks. Among the cities Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) picked 
up were Oxnard, Ventura and Santa Paula, all with large Latino populations. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly, who has offended some Latinos with his hard-line stance on illegal 
immigration, handily beat Democratic opponent Anita Perez Ferguson in 1992 to 
retain his congressional seat. But Ferguson and the Democrats were successful 
in registering thousands of Latino voters, Larkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Democrats ran a very aggressive registration campaign in 1992," Larkin 
said. "They gained about 12,000 or 13,000 voters on us. We plan to take that 
back this year. We're hoping to register about 15,000 voters." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans now have 149,361 voters registered in the county, about 8,000 more 
than the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To help maintain and increase the lead, Larkin said, the committee is putting 
together a computerized voter-information file, which will make it easier to 
target Republican voters and organize the committee's precinct operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, this will make us a stronger organization and we can avoid 
duplicating the efforts" of candidates, Larkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Central Committee's elections in June, Larkin doesn't expect 
conservative Christians to mount an attempt to recoup control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if any of the seats on the committee will be contested this 
time," he said. "I hope not." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some members who were philosophically aligned with the previous 
leadership remain, Larkin said there have been no infighting problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have in our group six or seven pretty strong pro-life people," he said. 
"But in their case, that's a personal belief and they don't try to bring that 
into the Central Committee. It doesn't belong there." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Ferrier, a former committee chairman who supported the conservative 
Christian faction and was among those ousted in the last election, agreed that 
the panel was too divisive in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both sides were factional and eager to fight when we should have spent our 
time and energy winning elections," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrier, a tutor at St. Aquinas College in Santa Paula, said he would like to 
serve on the committee again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not disillusioned by the experience," he said. "I know in any 
organization you're going to have disagreements. I actually found it to be a 
rather ennobling experience. It's something I'd like to do again."

VENTURA POOL PROPOSAL JUST NEEDS A SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With its miles of beaches, Ventura has much to offer water sports enthusiasts 
-- except a year-round public swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We have water everywhere," said Michael Swartout, a Ventura resident and 
father of three swimmers. "It is a fair responsibility for the city to provide 
a swimming pool. People need that." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not a lack of money but a scarcity of land that has kept Ventura from 
building a public pool. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the city set aside $5.6 million to build an Olympic-size swimming 
pool at Ventura College. But the city and the college have not reached 
agreement on several details. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, as the city grappled with lower tax revenues and state budget cuts, 
officials siphoned off $1.3 million from the pool fund to balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a shame that this money is languishing," said Rick Thrasaer, a 20-year 
Ventura resident and the father of a young swimmer, "particularly when the 
existing swimming pools in the city are not very good." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless they are content to take a dip in the ocean, Ventura swimmers have few 
choices: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city's recreation department offers a swimming program using the pools at 
the two public high schools. But the program is available only in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 For year-round swimming, residents can join private clubs such as the YMCA or 
the Pierpont Racquet Club. Adults can take swimming classes at Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an agreement approved by the Ventura City Council in April, 1991, the 
city would build a swimming pool, bathrooms and locker rooms in exchange for 
land on the Ventura College campus, said Jim K. Walker, the city's manager for 
community affairs and leisure services. 
</P>
<P>
 But negotiations ended in December, 1992, after the city refused the college's 
request to pay for renovations of the college tennis courts and to build an 
all-weather track on campus, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The critical point was whether the city was willing to do more than just 
build the (swimming) complex," Walker said. "We were willing to build the pool, 
but to expand beyond that was not financially feasible for the city." 
</P>
<P>
 College officials, however, say the all-weather track and tennis court 
renovations were included in the initial proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already have a swimming pool. Another pool is not a priority for us," said 
Ruth M. Hemming, Ventura College vice president for administrative services. 
She said the college is still interested in a project with the city, but needs 
more than a new pool to justify providing the land. 
</P>
<P>
 The new pool, initially scheduled to open last year, was to be built next to 
the college's existing pool. The new pool would be used only by students, and 
the older pool would be set aside for Ventura residents to use year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has not given up on the possibility of building a swimming pool 
elsewhere, Walker said, but no alternative site has been found. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city would have to purchase a property and then build the pool. At this 
point, we don't have that type of money available to us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One possibility is to build a swimming pool on city-owned land in the east end 
of Ventura that is slated for eventual development as a park. But because of a 
lack of funds, Walker said, the city does not foresee any progress on the park 
for three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another option is to exchange land with residents or developers for a pool 
site, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker still prefers the idea of a joint project with the college. But there 
are no plans to resume negotiations, he said. Everyone at the college who was 
involved in the initial discussions has left, including the president, vice 
president of administrative services and chancellor of the Community College 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Mayor Tom Buford said city officials are aware of the need for a 
public swimming pool but that construction is not likely to happen soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the city could build the pool on its own, it would have to find money 
for maintenance, Buford said. "With static revenues, it would be difficult to 
find additional funds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Ventura residents are unhappy about the delay in building a pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are disappointed that the city never did anything with that 
pool project," said Steve Baxter, who coaches the private Buenaventura Swimming 
Team in Ventura. "A good-sized swimming pool should be a requirement to any 
city. It gives kids something to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the absence of a public swimming pool, Baxter's team has won one of 
the most prestigious swimming competitions in the nation -- the National Junior 
Olympics -- in 1983 and 1987, and is hoping to win again next month. Since 
1984, three swimmers on the team have gone to swimming trials for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buenaventura team has about 120 swimmers ages 4 to 21 who rent the 
swimming pools at Ventura's two high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But those pools are inconvenient, Baxter said, because the team can use them 
only after 4 p.m. Sometimes the training sessions don't end until 7 or 8 p.m., 
which is too late for young children, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the city had a public pool, many more kids would be exposed to swimming 
and perhaps make it to the Olympics," Baxter said.

NEW RULES ENDORSED IN DOMESTIC ABUSE CASES; CRIME: SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTIONS ARE 
EXPECTED TO INCREASE. POLICE WILL PHOTOGRAPH AND TAPE VICTIMS IN CASE THEY 
LATER CHANGE THEIR MINDS ABOUT PRESSING CHARGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County police agencies have agreed on guidelines for investigating 
domestic violence cases -- a move that is expected to result in more successful 
prosecutions, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new countywide policy, officers answering domestic violence calls 
will tape victims' statements so that prosecutions can continue even if the 
victims change their minds. All wounds and bruises will be photographed. And 
details of the crime scene, such as torn clothing and overturned furniture, 
will be included in the officer's report. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related move, the district attorney's office has assigned an additional 
prosecutor and investigator to handle domestic violence cases, and Oxnard 
police have for the first time formed a two-person unit whose primary focus 
will be spousal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just assigning a higher priority to these kinds of cases," said Oxnard 
Police Cmdr. Tom Cady, who led the effort to develop the policy. "Research 
shows that batterers tend to come from families where they saw battering occur. 
If we can break that cycle of violence in the home, maybe we will also see a 
diminishing of the violence in the communities." 
</P>
<P>
 The new guidelines, contained in a 25-page booklet, were developed by a 
committee of the Ventura County Domestic Violence Task Force.  
</P>
<P>
 Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Colleen Toy White said the task force was 
assembled in 1991 to take a broad look at ways to reduce domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the county has witnessed several high-profile spousal-abuse cases, 
most notably the January, 1993, beating death of JoAnn Linkenauger. The 
Sheriff's Department came under fire in that case for failing to take action on 
several earlier complaints of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the new policy and other changes were in the works when those 
incidents occurred. "We just saw this as an area where we could do better," 
White said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to adding another attorney, the district attorney's office has 
changed the way that it prosecutes domestic violence. A special unit now 
handles all those cases, rather than allowing them to be mixed among other 
misdemeanors and felonies assigned to different prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Leigh, executive director of the Ventura County Coalition Against 
Household Violence, said she hopes that the new police policy will mean that 
all abuse victims in Ventura County are treated the same, regardless of where 
they live. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is really much more effective if you have a protocol countywide, so that 
everyone makes an effort to respond the same way," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leigh said she believes that there are small differences rather than "major 
gaps" in the way police departments in Ventura County approach the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really are, all things considered, fairly progressive," she said. "All the 
entities tend to make an effort to support one another." 
</P>
<P>
 Cady said the new policy, which went into effect late last year, does not 
differ much from what is already taught in police academies. But it does place 
greater responsibility on patrol officers to do investigative work that may 
prove crucial to a prosecution if a victim later refuses to cooperate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The booklet gives detailed instructions on when a suspect should be arrested 
and advice for women seeking an emergency protective order. Officers are also 
prohibited from asking victims whether they want to press charges. 
</P>
<P>
 To help collect evidence, all patrol officers in Oxnard now carry tape 
recorders, and the department recently purchased additional 35-millimeter 
cameras for photographing evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a commitment by the district attorney's office that if we gather 
information where they can move forward on a case, even if a victim changes her 
mind, they will go ahead and prosecute," Cady said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The number of felony spousal-abuse cases that have gone to court has increased 
from 10 in 1989 to 41 in 1992. Misdemeanor filings have risen from 54 in 1989 
to 217 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 For each of the past five years, police departments in Ventura County have 
received about 4,200 to 4,500 reports of domestic violence. Such calls are 
considered the most dangerous part of a patrol officer's duties and a high 
burnout area for prosecutors because of the number of victims who refuse to 
cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the police guidelines, the Ventura County Domestic Violence Task 
Force has developed a pilot program to assist emergency room doctors and nurses 
with reporting suspected abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say such an effort is important because domestic violence is the most 
common cause of women's injuries in emergency rooms, placing hospital personnel 
in a unique position to report battering. 
</P>
<P>
 "Physicians oftentimes know (that) what the victim is saying is not consistent 
with what the injury is," Leigh said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot program uses a three-part form for reporting abuse. One copy is 
given to the victim, another goes in a medical file and the third is given to 
the police agency where the victim lives. Officials hope to have the forms in 
all county hospitals later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic violence diversion programs are also expected to see changes within 
the next few months. Under a state law that takes effect July 1, the number of 
required counseling sessions will be increased and the time period for 
completing the sessions will be shortened.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY TO AUCTION TAX-DELINQUENT LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County officials plan to auction 41 parcels of land Wednesday, with minimum 
bids ranging from $945 for a parcel in Lockwood Valley to $1.5 million for an 
office building in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax collector has the right to auction the parcels because the landowners 
have failed to pay property taxes for more than five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Delinquent taxes from the properties total $1.3 million, according to a 
statement from the county treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, these are strange pieces of property," said Harold Pittman, county 
treasurer-tax collector. "Many times, you find you cannot build on the 
property, but it may have value to the people who own property next to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pittman said six of the plots have structures on them. 
</P>
<P>
 The properties, located throughout Ventura County, will be auctioned off 
beginning at 9 a.m. Wednesday in the Lower Plaza Assembly Room of the 
Administration Building, County Government Center, 800 S. Victoria Ave., 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Only cash, cashier's checks or certified checks will be accepted, and all of 
the sales are "as is."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: 3 AUTO SHOPS OKD FOR OIL RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three Ventura County auto shops have been certified by the California 
Integrated Waste Management Board to collect and recycle used oil from the 
public, bringing to 10 the number of state-certified facilities in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Poole Oil Co. and Ventura Oil Co., both in Oxnard, were approved last 
week.Ojai Valley Imports in Ojai was approved last month, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers who bring their used motor oil to certified businesses will be paid 
four cents per quart under the state's new Used Oil Recycling Program, which 
went into effect last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, the state certifies private businesses to become oil 
collection centers, provided they accept oil during normal business hours and 
agree to pay four cents per quart. The board then reimburses the centers for 
the payment. Funds for the program are generated from an assessment on oil sold 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was created as a way to stop people from illegally disposing of 
used oil into the environment, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are now 175 certified centers in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Certified collection centers in Ventura County are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Adamson's Automotive Repair, 814 S. Bryant St., Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 * Easy Oil, 77 Park Lane, Unit F, Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gabriels Independent Auto Repair, 65 W. Baldwin Road, Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jiffy Lube, 2905 Thousand Oaks Blvd., Thousand Oaks; 274 Arneill Road, 
Camarillo, and 1098 E. Thompson Blvd., Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ojai Valley Imports, 996 E. Ojai Ave, Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pep Boys, 2099 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd., Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Poole Oil Co., 3885 Vineyard Ave., Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ventura Oil Co., 3815 Vineyard Ave., Oxnard. TRACY WILSON

 The Thousand Oaks City Council will try to streamline the permit process for 
residents hoping to build additions or make other minor home improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The new procedures will allow residents to apply for permits at the Planning 
Department counter in City Hall, instead of waiting for an administrative 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors would be notified of the permit application and could request a 
hearing to voice concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to give people the opportunity to come to a hearing and present their 
case," said Francisco Behr, a local architect who argued for the changes. "But 
if we can make (hearings) optional, we can reduce the time, the cost and the 
workload for city staff." 
</P>
<P>
 The change comes just seven months after the council established the 
administrative hearing procedure, with the goal of soliciting more citizen 
input in even routine cases. Only a handful of the 150 administrative hearings 
conducted so far have been controversial, leading some applicants to question 
the need for so much red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're holding meetings, and no one's coming but staff and the applicant," 
Behr said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new procedure was approved in principle Tuesday, but still needs to be 
formalized with an amendment to the Municipal Code. 
</P>
<P>
 Several council members said they liked the idea of simplifying the permit 
process, as long as residents retain the right to contest applications and 
appeal decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point is," Councilman Frank Schillo said, "they live in the neighborhood 
and they should get a chance to have their say." STEPHANIE SIMON

<P>
 PTI Technologies, an aerospace firm in Newbury Park, has been selected to 
receive the first "Business Showcase Awards," sponsored by Thousand Oaks and 
the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce to recognize contributions to the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "PTI has been here almost 30 years and many people don't even know who they 
are," Thousand Oaks Mayor Elois Zeanah said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, this is a reason to showcase local businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah, who also sits on the chamber's economic development committee, said 
she proposed the showcase awards because of the need "to increase communication 
between businesses and residents. I think we should just crow about what we 
have here in our own valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses are judged on longevity, contributions to the community, unique 
character, or how good an employer or neighbor the business is. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah said she would like to hand out the awards weekly if there are enough 
outstanding businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Entry forms are available at the chamber or Thousand Oaks City Hall. For 
information, call the chamber at 499-1993. CONSTANCE SOMMER

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; ANOTHER DAY ADDED TO COURTHOUSE HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The hours at the East County Courthouse will be expanded to include another 
full day, Ventura County Supervisor Vicky Howard announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, who has made it her goal to increase county services in the east end 
of the county, said she was glad that Commissioner John Pattie was adding a 
third day to his current two-day schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Pattie now hears family law cases on Mondays and Thursdays. Under the new 
schedule -- which goes into effect the week of April 4 -- he will also hear 
family law and civil cases on Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adding an extra court day and civil cases in Simi Valley means east county 
residents will not have to make the long drive to Ventura," Howard said in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased we've been able to expand our services." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard in 1992 pushed for the addition of a second court commissioner to the 
East County Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner David Long is also stationed at the Simi Valley facility, and 
hears Municipal Court cases every weekday except Thursdays, officials said.

 An 8-year-old boy was killed Monday when the car he was riding in collided 
with another vehicle on California 33 near Ojai, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the California Highway Patrol said Sergio Ramirez was 
transported shortly before 5 p.m. to Ojai Valley Hospital, where he was 
pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the second vehicle, a Ford pickup, was arrested on suspicion of 
felony drunk driving, the spokesman said. He said investigators believe the 
truck was traveling too fast around a curve and crossed over the center line, 
crashing into the car. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP officials said their investigation is continuing. TINA DAUNT

 Five Oxnard residents, including two juveniles, have been arrested for 
attempting to steal $3,000 worth of computer equipment from Channel Islands 
High School, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said witnesses saw the five climbing a school fence about 2 p.m. 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Several minutes later, two Oxnard bicycle patrol officers located the five and 
the computer equipment in a nearby neighborhood. 
</P>

 Those arrested in connection with the burglary include the juveniles -- ages 
14 and 16 -- and three others, identified as Andy Bernardino, 18; Ramon

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; ARTISTS SOUGHT TO REDESIGN PUBLIC PLAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Ventura is seeking applications from artists to help redesign a 
10,000-square-foot public plaza at the end of California Street. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of long-term plans to revitalize the downtown area, city leaders plan 
to fix up California Street because it links the downtown to the Pacific 
Ocean.The plaza, sandwiched between the Holiday Inn and a municipal parking 
structure, will be spruced up and will provide a link to downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist chosen for the job will work with the project manager and architect 
as part of a design team, said Sonia Tower, the city's cultural arts 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are not stipulating what they want the artist to do, Tower 
said. The artist could end up designing anything from a sculpture to unique 
water fountains and benches, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist should be available to work extensively on the project in late 
March and April, city officials said. The artist's fee will be a maximum of 
$12,000, including time and materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Deadline for applications is March 11. Artists should include a resume, slides 
of recent work and a typed letter of interest.

PROTECTION NEEDED FOR FOOTHILL FORESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Who are the protectors of your foothill forests? Not necessarily the Los 
Angeles County Fire Department. Following the earthquake, this department used 
heavy equipment to reopen and extravagantly widen an old dirt road named the 
East Canyon Motorway. Readers may have enjoyed Sierra Club hikes on this road. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the working crew, the road was reopened to provide an emergency 
route for departments of public safety. Yet construction started after the Jan. 
17 earthquake, and the road was not available for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department removed all tree canopy arched over the road and destroyed 
many large walnut and ash trees and innumerable young trees on the side of the 
road. The largest native ash tree on the entire route was cut despite being 
located 10 feet from the side of the roadway. Woodlands composed of a mix of 
native ash and walnut are not known to occur anywhere in the state except in 
this part of the Santa Susana Mountains. All cut trees and limbs were thrown to 
the side of the road and not removed. They are unsightly, poor ecology and 
future fire hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 The East Canyon Motorway traverses Significant Ecological Area No. 20 and 
constitutes part of the Browning-Ferris Inc. mitigation for a landfill 
expansion. The land is to be given to parks and would become part of Santa 
Clarita Woodlands State Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's Division of Forestry is a part of the Fire Department. Was the 
division involved or consulted? Do the supervisors of heavy equipment crews and 
construction projects know anything about significant ecological areas or 
native trees other than oaks? The system of SEAs was made by the county to 
inventory and protect to some degree the best of county open space and is part 
of the county master plan. 
</P>
<P>
 On this project, the public loses once again. Who influenced whom, and who 
gains? We will probably never know. Possible winners are the Chevron Corp. or 
BFI, each of which owns about half of the East Canyon. Other landowners also 
have keys to the gates and are attempting to use the road. All try to keep the 
public from walking through their lands. 
</P>
<P>
 Your true friends are the state park agencies and park activists who are 
trying to preserve the forests and make them available to you. Voting yes on 
the California Parks and Wildlife Initiative in the 1994 primary election will 
help the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy make parks in the area.

LIMITED COMMON GROUND WITH MCA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In the battle of giants over the location of a subway station in Studio 
City, the homeowners in the area appear to be the losers. We are the people who 
most clearly understand the implications of the decisions being made in our 
behalf, yet our voices go unrecognized, or when heard, are misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Times column said, "North Hollywood residents supporting MCA, 
organized by company executive Christine Hanson, were in the audience. Some of 
them testified for MCA." 
</P>
<P>
 I testified for the Studio City Residents Assn. It so happens that my 
testimony supported the MCA position. That position, as I stated at the 
hearing, was arrived at by a board of directors which was instructed by a 
membership conversant with all of the issues to speak in favor of a station 
proposed by MCA. In the future, if MCA changes its position, we could find 
ourselves, as we have in the past, on opposite sides of the issues. However, at 
this time, our interests, while not identical, do coincide. 
</P>
<P>
 The association has worked for many years to achieve traffic mitigation 
measures on the Barham Blvd./Cahuenga Pass corridor. We were at the stage of 
completion of the engineering phases when MTA, which was to pay for the final 
phase, found itself without sufficient funds to fulfill their promise. When MCA 
proposed a station located on Cahuenga West, we found the proposal, overall, to 
be in the best interests of our membership and overwhelmingly supported by that 
membership. We were not happy about the parking structure that would be built 
but found that preferable to such a structure on Lankershim or Ventura 
Boulevard. We also saw that the needed traffic measures on the Cahuenga Pass 
corridor would then have to be made, proving a boon to the area and to Studio 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Studio City Residents Assn. believes in keeping our eyes on the end goal, 
which in this case means a station in our community having the least possible 
negative effects on our neighborhoods, and bringing with it the greatest 
enhancements. We believe that the MCA-proposed station would cause the least 
disruption to our neighborhoods, lend itself to the best traffic mitigation and 
provide the greatest security to our residents. If that means we are in 
alliance with the giant, so be it. You can call us realists, or pragmatists, or 
opportunists. But please don't put us in a class with lobbyists. Because we 
don't get paid for this.

THE EARTHQUAKE; AS CRISIS RECEDES, SPIRIT OF TOGETHERNESS MUST LAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The board of the Canoga Park/West Hills Chamber of Commerce wishes to 
express its anguish at the destruction caused by the Jan. 17 earthquake. Upon 
touring Canoga Park and West Hills, one sees massive damage to many homes, 
businesses and lives.The full extent of the impact of the earthquake has not 
been determined. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be an increase in employment and income in the short term, as we 
repair. Let us assist in the long term by financially supporting one another in 
our rebuilding efforts. I would like to remind and encourage everyone to seek 
the services of local businesses -- the people who live and work in the 
community, not the ones who are here today and gone tomorrow. Unfortunately 
there are many who take advantage of this tragic situation by inflating prices. 
Our local businesses need your patronage and will be here to service the 
community long after this catastrophe has passed. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the board would like to express appreciation and gratitude to all 
who responded in giving help to others, emergency services and local agencies 
as well. I thought it was remarkable considering the extent of the damages to 
see how quickly the utility companies had things back on line. Everyone pulled 
together and assisted each other, neighbors and businesses alike. The best 
emerged during a difficult time. We need to keep that spirit alive.

DONATE TO LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All of us are very fortunate that the Jan. 17 earthquake struck when it did, 
at 4:31 a.m. on a holiday while the Thousand Oaks Library was closed. Only one 
person was in the building.The razor-sharp metal ceiling slats came down, 
slicing water pipes and books, gashing shelving, furniture and counters, 
cutting through the carpeting as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheared-off water mains gushed angry torrents of water for hours after the 
initial shock. The force was strong enough to bore holes through triple walls, 
leaving six inches of water standing in some parts of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Had this happened when our library was open, I hate to think of the carnage. 
Between 2,500 and 3,000 library patrons visit the Main Library daily. There can 
be between 300 and 400 people in the library at any one time, with as many a 
500 on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to pick up the pieces and start over. The Thousand Oaks Library 
Restoration Committee's goal is to raise $250,000 to replace library materials 
that will not be covered by FEMA loans and other government intervention.

 If everyone who holds a Thousand Oaks Library card will donate $5, we will 
more than meet our monetary goal. If only the citizens of Thousand Oaks will 
make a donation of $46, an amount equivalent to the annual cost per resident 
allocated to library services by the city, we can open a "new and improved" 
Main Library. Think of the possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is, "How important are superior library services to you?"

CHILDREN DESERVE A PERMANENT COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your editorial supporting the satellite children's court in the Antelope 
Valley (Jan. 30) was appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 Your insights into the devastating effects of forcing distressed families into 
a transportation nightmare of 140-plus-mile round trips to make court 
appearances is the prime reason a permanent dependency court is required. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding insult to injury by requiring abused and neglected children to travel 
over 70 miles each way to go to court, a trip that takes two to six hours each 
day, is unconscionable. 
</P>
<P>
 We were successful in opening the satellite court in the Antelope Valley last 
July. This was a welcome relief. 
</P>
<P>
 With the recent devastating earthquake, the collapsed freeways punctuated the 
need for expanded county services in the Antelope Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 We have been working with Superior Court Judge Marcus Tucker, presiding judge 
of the Juvenile Court, to make the satellite dependency court in the Antelope 
Valley permanent.

CANYON OAKS PROJECT BENEFITS ADD UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As I understand it, the developer of the Canyon Oaks Project, which I 
support, will increase on-site water tank storage capacity from 1.1 million 
gallons to 3 million gallons. Of this, 1.6 million will go for the project's 
consumption and firefighting needs, and 1.4 million will meet existing 
customers' firefighting and consumption needs -- a 27% increase for the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, a 500,000-gallon storage tank will be buried under the driving range. It 
will store reclaimed water generated by the on-site treatment plant and catch 
rainwater for later use on the golf course. The 500,000-gallon reservoir is in 
addition to the 3-million-gallon water tank and can also be used in case of 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 A completed Canyon Oaks will pay $3 million in annual property taxes, a 2,900% 
increase. Presently the developer pays $100,000 on unimproved land. 
</P>
<P>
 Another benefit would be builders' fees of $3 million paid to the Los Angeles 
Unified School District, the county Parks Department, the Sheriff's Department 
and several other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Many permanent jobs will be created, and this will contribute income tax. Many 
are predicted to locate in the West Valley, purchasing property and frequenting 
local stores.

EDUCATING THE PUBLIC ABOUT WILDLIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * If Phyllis Daugherty (Letters, Jan. 8) doesn't appreciate or understand the 
compassion and knowledge behind the "humane community's" attempt to educate the 
public on how important all wildlife is in Los Angeles, including the coyote, 
then I suggest she move to Wyoming where they are planning a coyote kill for 
Feb. 4 and 6, awarding prizes for the biggest coyote killed and the largest 
number killed. Also, South Dakota, Idaho and Arizona. No powerful humane 
community there, just knee-jerk hunters.

THE EARTHQUAKE; CLOSURE OF HIGH SCHOOL WAS NOT A DONE DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was disappointed by the coverage of the reopening of El Camino High School 
("High School to be Shut at Least a Month," Feb. 3). It suggested a "done deal" 
and failed to recognize the efforts to pursue other alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 I attended the recent meeting in the gymnasium at the school on Feb. 2 to 
stress my commitment to help the El Camino school community consider immediate 
options, beyond just waiting for the arrival of portable classroom buildings. 
The decision to wait for portable classrooms, made quickly by district 
officials after the earthquake, failed to involve the parents and did not 
appreciate their strong desire to return students to class right away. 
</P>
<P>
 As I write, the principal, Joyce Washington, and a committee of parents, 
teachers, students and other staff members are considering specific 
alternatives. I support and will help implement immediately whatever 
recommendation comes forth from this process at the school. In the meantime, 
the district will allow El Camino students to transfer to any other Los Angeles 
Unified School District high school with available space. In addition, many 
interim educational workshops and other services are available right now at El 
Camino. 
</P>
<P>
 I share the frustration of many parents regarding the delays and other 
shortcomings in the communication process at El Camino following the quake. 
While we hurry to repair the school, I urge the school community to come 
together and arrive at a short-term plan in the best interests of all the 
students at El Camino.

THE EARTHQUAKE; AID TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SPURS CALL FOR ROSS PEROT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I read with shock in the paper ("FEMA Makes Its Point in Spanish," Jan. 28) 
that the government is giving aid to illegal immigrants left homeless by the 
quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 This is so outrageous I refuse to believe it's true.Not only do illegal 
immigrants clog our courts, our hospitals and our schools, they can now get a 
check for a place to live that also originated from our tax dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government financed and developed the welfare system in America, 
and now, in most parts of the country instead of looking for a job, they are 
looking for a federal handout. Why work when the benefits to stay unemployed 
exceed the benefits to work? 
</P>
<P>
 In France it took Charles DeGaulle to make the country fiscally responsible. 
In Great Britain, it took Maggie Thatcher. In the United States I'm afraid it's 
going to take Ross Perot. When are we going to force the federal government to 
become fiscally responsible?

THE EARTHQUAKE; WORKERS DESERVE PAT ON BACK FOR ROAD REPAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * We wish to commend those involved in alleviating the traffic mess in 
northern L.A. County since the recent earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and MetroLink, Rideshare, 
the Antelope Valley Transit Authority, the Highway Patrol, the sheriff's 
office, federal park rangers and many unnamed others are to be congratulated 
for their phenomenal progress in diverting traffic in these areas, providing 
commuter opportunities and minimizing a potential disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Four major freeways converge into two mountain passes where 100,000-plus cars 
travel daily. When this passage was destroyed, quick and cooperative thinking 
and action by these agencies, working 24-hour shifts, began to lessen traffic 
dependency on these routes and restore smooth access. 
</P>
<P>
 Our jobs entail varied work schedules and locations but are based in the San 
Gabriel and San Fernando valleys. We live in the Antelope Valley. When the 
quake hit Jan. 17, we were stranded, and yet as soon as Jan. 19 we were able to 
get to work via Angeles Forest/Crest highways. Later, the area of the 5 and 14 
freeways was temporarily reopened via various side streets. These all were 
tedious and slow but beat being stranded or going the long way around. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently we ventured on the newly opened southbound 14 freeway. We were 
astounded at the fast progress and phenomenal results. Imagine government and 
progress in the same sentence -- what a concept. In less than three weeks the 
tireless efforts of the employees of these government agencies were able to 
bring this passage back up to nearly full speed. They deserve a pat on the 
back.

EARMARK FUNDS FOR CSL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the strongest voices and most successful advocates for older Americans 
has been the California Senior Legislature. But CSL's future is threatened with 
extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless enough Californians earmark a portion of their state income taxes for 
the California Senior Legislature, CSL will lose its only source of funds. A 
statewide minimum of $250,000 is required for this fund to remain on the tax 
form. Without that minimum, the California Fund for Seniors will be dropped 
from future tax returns and CSL will be out of business. (From a once $470,000 
annual fund, last year, an all-time low of $270,000 was contributed.) 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors have already reaped a multitude of benefits of the California Senior 
Legislature's work. Nursing home reforms, drug labeling reforms, the broadening 
of in-home support services, strengthening California's long-term care network 
-- and dozens more valuable contributions to California's senior population 
have been the remarkable record of the CSL for 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the current attention to universal access to health care might not be 
taking place if not for CSL's unrelenting pressure. The 120 members who serve 
as uncompensated elected representatives of older Californians have made the 
issue of universal health care their No. 1 priority for the past eight years. 
Finally, our government is listening. 
</P>
<P>
 So, when preparing your 1993 return, or when your preparer does it for you, 
earmark a few dollars for the California Senior Legislature. Remember, Line 49 
on the State Tax Return: the California Fund for Seniors.

ENGINEERING HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This month, the engineering professional societies celebrate the 
accomplishments of their profession. As a registered civil engineer with 50 
years experience, I suggest that the local engineers give more attention to the 
local needs of this county. 
</P>
<P>
 The quality of the planning, engineering, construction and maintenance of the 
fixed improvements is deplorable. The freeways and their ramps are congested. 
The streets and highways do not drain. The storm drains do not function 
properly and are stopped up when needed to function. The sewage pumping plants 
stink as they fail to operate properly. The sight distances for pedestrian and 
vehicular traffic are substandard and dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic design and construction can be greatly improved. The channels are not 
improved in accordance with urban requirements. The domestic water quality is 
substandard, and the number of water agencies and districts to provide water is 
ridiculous. I can safely state that the quality of improvements here is the 
lowest in Southern California if not in the Western United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The responsibility for this lies equally with both the private and public 
sectors of the profession. This can only be corrected with better 
communication, cooperation, adoption of standard drawings and specifications, 
quality inspection, overall planning and administration among each 
jurisdiction, and professional organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Come on, local engineers, let's perform for the benefit of the public a little 
more before we blow our horns so much. There is much to do here, and the talent 
and need is here to do it.

EXPAND SIMI'S IMAGE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Why is it that Simi Valley -- a city noted for low crime, conservative family 
values and a high percentage of church-going people -- also has to be viewed as 
a ready target for those who would support bigotry, white supremacy and racist 
hate literature? 
</P>
<P>
 Before the area's conservative values are inexorably linked to racism and 
intolerance, possibly we should work to expand Simi Valley's image to something 
more worthy of an enlightened, spiritually grounded community.

 On behalf of the children and families served by the Public Social Services 
Agency, Protective Services Division, CAAN (Child Abuse And Neglect) and the 
Children's Services Auxiliary, I would like to commend the generosity and

<P>
 Each year, our organizations give toys and gifts to children who are in foster 
care or at risk of abuse or neglect in their own homes.This year, more than 400 
social workers, foster parents and biological families "shopped" at our special 
toy store. Nearly 2,000 children received at least three gifts each this 
holiday season.

GET LIFE RAFTS READY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When somebody knocks on your door more than once, isn't it reasonable to 
assume that they are trying to tell you something? 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the more than 4,000 aftershocks we've had since the Northridge 
quake, I would suggest that every Californian add a bright yellow inflatable 
rubber life raft to their earthquake survival gear.This life raft will come in 
handy when California finally breaks off and slips into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 But make sure you get a raft that will inflate automatically. When the time 
comes when you need it, you won't have time to take more than one or two 
breaths, and that won't be enough to inflate it. We can all learn a lesson from 
the experience of seeing Pharaoh's chariots pursuing Charlton Heston -- I mean 
Moses -- and the Israelites between the parted waves of the Red Sea. Remember 
when the waves closed in on top of them? If they had thought to equip their 
chariots with automatically inflatable life rafts, all of them would have 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, it would be wise to invest in a small outboard motor. If paddles are the 
only thing that you have, it will take a long time to reach the Nevada 
shoreline.

DISTRICT DOES HAVE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your Feb. 4 story on the Ventura County Community College District ("College 
Officials Seek Disaster Plan") states that our organization did not have an 
emergency plan in place for our students and staff. In fact, our district and 
its three colleges have had an emergency plan in place since approval by the 
Board of Trustees in 1984.This plan uses the same philosophy, approach and 
structure as the plans developed by other public entities, and each member of 
the staff has been given a copy of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency-plan training is an ongoing activity throughout our district. In 
addition, the necessary medical and rescue materials are stored and ready for 
use at each college, and all district vehicles contain instructions on 
emergency procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 The terrible disaster on Jan. 17 did reveal, however, that our internal 
communications network requires greater refinement, and this has been a high 
priority effort since that date.

 California state humane officers went to the Warner Ranch with a search

office of county auditor-controller and Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton's 
purported remarks about his qualifications for that position, I believe some 
comments should be made. 
</P>
<P>
 He was quoted as saying, apparently because of his 10 credit hours in 
unspecified accounting courses, "I believe I have the education to be a CPA." 
</P>
<P>
 In order to be licensed as a CPA in the state of California, a candidate must 
pass the 2 1/2-day uniform CPA examination, pass an ethics examination and have 
a minimum number of three years of experience in the practice of public 
accounting. 
</P>
<P>
 His Honor's 10 units of accounting would not qualify him to take the CPA 
examination, let alone permit him to practice as a certified public accountant.

GIVE BACK THE RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing to you as a private citizen, but also as a county employee and a 
councilwoman for the city of Santa Paula. I was shocked by the decision of our 
Ventura County judges to raise the salary of Court Clerk Sheila Gonzalez. While 
it may be true that some of her ideas have helped save the county money, isn't 
that her job? Isn't that the job of all county employees? 
</P>
<P>
 I think we are forgetting that it is the rank-and-file workers who actually 
implement those ideas and whose workloads have increased as a result of the 
cuts in staff from those ideas, while their salaries have not increased. They 
are not being rewarded for the efforts they make. 
</P>
<P>
 More attention should be paid to what is fair. This elitist system is 
offensive and expensive. I praise the seven judges who did not vote for the 
raise, both for their sensitivity to their co-workers and for their commitment 
to the taxpayers of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 In a time when the Board of Supervisors is trying to limit management "perks" 
and automatic raises, it would have been wiser for all of the judges to have 
joined in the spirit of these conservation efforts. The morale of county 
workers is at an all-time low, as is the trust many citizens place in their 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Gonzalez, give back your raise. Show us your good faith. Don't keep saying 
to the rank and file: "Let them eat cake."

OBSERVATIONS OF A VAN-POOL RIDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * After the earthquake, my fellow van-pool riders and I switched to taking the 
train from Santa Clarita to Burbank, then from Burbank to Century City, where 
we all work. Once the 14 and 5 freeways were partially reopened, we returned to 
driving our van. There are several observations that I have made in the short 
time that I took the train. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the vast majority of people that are taking the train from Santa 
Clarita (I would estimate 80%) go only as far as Burbank. The fare to Burbank 
is the same as to Union Station, even though it is slightly more than halfway. 
The fares on the Metrolink are based in part on the cost of parking Downtown. 
More people would probably ride the train if fares to Burbank were lower than 
to Union Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, I expected the train schedules to become more accurate as time went on 
and the Metrolink authorities got used to the addition of new trains. A week 
and a half later, the train schedule still showed a 50-minute commute to Union 
Station even though there were three more train stations and the train was so 
long that it had to make two stops at each station. The pre-earthquake 
50-minute ride is now one hour and 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, from the traffic that I see on the freeway, the people still on the 
train are the ones who work near one of the train stations. The traffic on 
Interstate 5 is still relatively light south of the 14 freeway, while traffic 
on the 405 freeway is now back to its normal backups. 
</P>
<P>
 We're told that 5% of the population of Los Angeles works Downtown. Yet 80% of 
all mass transit money is spent getting those 5% to work. The rest of us are 
left out in the cold. Getting express buses to the Westside is next to 
impossible. The 573 bus from Santa Clarita to Granada Hills to Century City 
takes about 1 1/2 hours because of all the stops it must make. My van pool 
takes only 50 minutes for the same trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Caltrans have been trying to get 
people to rideshare for a long time now. The number of people car-pooling on 
the Antelope Valley Freeway has dramatically increased since the car-pool lane 
was added. 
</P>
<P>
 Car-pool lanes are desperately needed on the San Diego Freeway from the Santa 
Monica Freeway north to the Golden State Freeway. This would undoubtedly have 
the same effect on drivers as the car-pool lane on the 14 freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, I found that Metrolink riders were friendly and courteous. There was 
no elbowing or shoving as has been described in at least two articles in The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 If I were working Downtown, I would be riding the train to work every day in 
spite of the current problems that Metrolink is having.

MEDICAL BOARD TO TEST FORMULA ON COMPLAINTS; DISCIPLINE: THE SYSTEM WILL SCREEN 
FOR SERIOUSNESS OF OFFENSE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF PHYSICIANS. SOME SAY IT'S 
DISCRIMINATORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attempting to speed up its enforcement efforts, the state medical board has 
developed a screening system to identify which complaints are most likely to 
result in the disciplining of physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, which is in charge of licensing and disciplining California's 
78,000 practicing physicians, is expected to test the program in the coming 
year in at least one of its 12 regional field offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The unique screening system, which identifies some characteristics of 
physicians who are likely to exhibit incompetent or unethical behavior, was 
created through a study of 732 previous cases investigated by the board over 
the past three years that resulted in discipline. It will also screen for 
seriousness of offense and where the complaint originated. 
</P>
<P>
 The $66,000 study is intended to help investigators sort through a daunting 
number of complaints.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are overwhelmed. Anything that would streamline the investigation process 
and identify potential violators would help," said Felix Rodriguez, supervising 
investigator in the board's Santa Ana office. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez said investigators sometimes can immediately identify "a heavy-duty 
case." But often, he said, they are surprised to watch the scope of a complaint 
grow more serious and complex as an investigation unfolds. He said he is eager 
to discover if the screening mechanism will be a better predictor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints against the state's doctors are on the upswing. Last year, the 
Medical Board of California received 8,757 complaints and this year the number 
is expected to exceed 10,000. These cases are shouldered by 100 investigators, 
each of whom handle an average of 45 cases at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon Arnett, the board's executive director, recommended last March that the 
board adopt a case screening method.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is a management tool for us. It tells us how to invest our time and 
energy. Like most law enforcement organizations, we are understaffed and 
overworked. . . . We have to work smart as well as hard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Hasenkamp, an attorney and president of the medical board, said he and 
other board members were excited by a recent presentation of the screening 
model. He expects the board to adopt the program on a trial basis at its next 
meeting in May. 
</P>
<P>
 In deciding which cases should get priority, the mathematical formula 
considers the seriousness of the complaint, giving greatest importance to fraud 
and lowest to unprofessional conduct. It also considers the source of the 
complaint. And it gives greater weight to whether the physician has been 
previously disciplined by the board. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps most intriguing, for each type of offense, the model lists 
specific physician characteristics that have been shown to increase the 
likelihood that an investigation will result in suspension or revocation of 
their licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The characteristics considered are a physician's age, specialty, the specific 
country where his or her medical degree was obtained, whether the doctor is 
board certified and whether a hospital already has taken disciplinary action 
against the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, for complaints involving sexual misconduct, the model would 
highlight a physician who is over 60, in family practice, general surgery or 
general practice, not board certified and a graduate of a medical school in 
Argentina, Bangladesh, the United Kingdom or Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, an accusation that a physician is suffering from a mental illness 
is more apt to be red-flagged under the proposed system if the physician is 
under 45 years of age and not board certified. 
</P>
<P>
 And board investigators, the model says, should pay special attention to 
complaints about sexual misconduct, substance abuse, gross negligence, 
incompetence and improper drug prescribing when the doctor has been previously 
disciplined by a hospital for any reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in giving weight to who filed the complaint, the profile finds that 
particular sources often are more fruitful when it comes to certain offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Some within the medical community contend that the criteria in the proposed 
formula may unfairly discriminate against the state's many foreign-educated 
doctors, doctors who are not board certified and those in particular age 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Shannon, associate vice president of government relations for the 
California Medical Assn., called it "a good idea (that) the board is attempting 
to prioritize cases. Too often in the past we felt that the board spends far 
too many of its resources on more or less minor offenses and not enough 
disciplining really egregious offenders." 
</P>
<P>
 "But," he added, "we have questions about some of the characteristics they are 
using." 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon, who attended the presentation to the board this month, said he 
"pointed out that if a physician by chance was a foreign medical graduate who 
was not board certified, this system would move his case to the top of the 
pile. Those characteristics are not related to quality." 
</P>
<P>
 Few doctors have had an opportunity to analyze the plan. But when the proposed 
guidelines were described to Dr. Richard Kammerman, a 64-year-old family 
practice physician who is past president of the Orange County Medical Assn., he 
too said they appeared "prejudicial against the foreign school graduate" for 
some offenses and against the older physician for others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would feel a little nervous about them going out after the international 
graduate," Kammerman said. "The foreign medical school graduates I know and 
have used in my practice have all been top-notch physicians." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. James Schubert, whose Sacramento consulting firm was hired to create the 
screening system, said it was designed by Doraiswamy Ramachandran, a professor 
of mathematics and statistics at Cal State Sacramento. The model was based on 
the last three years of cases that resulted in board disciplinary action, which 
means the revocation or suspension of physician licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Schubert acknowledged that the program has shortcomings. He said he would like 
to add a "measurement of public harm" for ranking complaints against 
physicians, giving additional priority to those that involve a patient's death 
or permanent disability. 
</P>
<P>
 However, medical board investigators noted that public safety already receives 
top consideration in determining which cases will get their immediate 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Schubert said the model was tested against 332 medical board cases that 
resulted in no disciplinary action. The screening system, with few exceptions, 
similarly gave them a low priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Schubert said, he wants to field test the screening model for a year in 
one of the medical board's regional offices to see if investigations there are 
more productive.

BUILDING BRIDGES -- AND TRUST; PRIESTS' PROGRAM PLANTS SEED OF HOPE FOR GANG 
MEMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As three Catholic priests take an afternoon stroll through the streets of the 
gang-infested Logan-Lacy neighborhood, a tough-looking youth hangs out a 
second-story window of a run-down apartment building, waves his arms 
enthusiastically and shouts, "Padres!" 
</P>
<P>
 The warm greeting is typical of the reception that Brendan Smith, Stan Bosch 
and Christopher Smith receive as they make their way through this neighborhood, 
greeting some of the neighborhood's toughest gang members and their families by 
name -- and usually with a hug. 
</P>
<P>
 Tattooed teen-agers, many with criminal records, openly show their affection 
for the three clergymen, who have established a remarkable trust and rapport 
with gang members in a community where suspicion and fear are a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "As priests, we get that trust and we try to use that in a positive way," said 
Christopher Smith, who became pastor of St. Joseph's Catholic Church four years 
ago. "It's important that we're out there and that the kids have a sense that 
we are adults that they can trust and feel connected to." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the youths, members of a single gang that claims the area around the 
church as its turf, participate in an extraordinary weekly outreach program 
called "Building Bridges," run by the priests at St. Joseph's, which is located 
in the heart of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Left outside the church is the macho posturing and talk of retaliation against 
rival gangs, behavior which is part of everyday life in a neighborhood plagued 
by poverty, drugs and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, these brief respites from the turbulence beyond the church door are 
marked by serene, unlikely images of teen-agers singing, drawing and holding 
hands in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is a place where, together with the priests, the gang members have 
mourned the death of six of their "homeboys" killed in gang warfare since the 
outreach program began in November, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of the teen-agers say that it would be impossible for them to 
leave their gangs unless they leave the neighborhood entirely, the outreach 
program seems to have planted a seed of hope in some who had previously seemed 
resigned to their fates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought before that there was another way to live, but I didn't know how to 
make it happen," said 17-year-old Carlos Madrigal. "I didn't think I was going 
to make it. But now I think I'm going to make it." 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings typically draw 15 to 20 youths each week, depending on "who is in 
jail," Bosch said. He said the encounters give him a chance to get to know a 
group of kids he describes as "the most lost." 
</P>
<P>
 The relationships the youths have developed with the priests and other 
volunteers at the outreach meetings are the only positive encounters many ever 
have with adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "They talk to us and are interested in us," said 17-year-old Robert Ordaz. 
"They give us ideas of what is right and wrong. Other guys don't have this 
chance that we have. Instead of being outside, I spend two hours here where 
it's safe. If you're in the streets, you could be shot." 
</P>
<P>
 The three clergymen have been joined in the outreach program by a group of 
volunteers -- professionals from various walks of life -- who have also 
developed relationships with the gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 But the priests remain the spiritual backbone of the effort. Although the 
three are not affiliated with one another in an official capacity, all live 
within the church compound and their individual interests brought them together 
for this effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosch, 39, who is head of Trinity Missions, a school housed in the church's 
old convent, had worked with gang members in East Los Angeles for two years 
before coming to Santa Ana. He also had worked as a probation officer on the 
East Coast before being ordained. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Smith, 41, said he had "not a clue" what faced him as pastor of 
St. Joseph's Church when he arrived from another Orange County church. But he 
expanded on his more traditional roles as a pastor and began to take a more 
active and visible role in the streets after meeting Bosch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect that I would be doing some of the things I'm doing in this 
parish," the pastor said. "And although I was a little hesitant at first, I 
haven't felt threatened or afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 Bosch said, "We connected very much and realized that we had a lot of the same 
hopes and dreams for the area. We realized that these are our people and we 
belong to one another." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They were joined in their vision by 65-year-old Brendan Smith, who has been a 
full-time Catholic chaplain in Orange County jails and juvenile detention 
facilities for the last decade. He resides at Trinity Missions with Bosch. 
</P>
<P>
 Brendan Smith, who met many of the gang members when they were incarcerated 
and at their most vulnerable, is a crucial link in continuing those 
relationships once they are released. 
</P>
<P>
 The clergymen say many of the gang members have developed an increasing 
reverence for St. Joseph's, which was built more than 50 years ago at the 
corner of Minter Street and East Civic Center Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 A six-foot brick wall that surrounds the church was built last summer with the 
help of some of the gang members. Remarkably, it has remained virtually the 
only blank space in a neighborhood that is splattered with gang-related 
graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day that there's nothing on that wall is a victory," said Christopher 
Smith. "The church has become a sacred ground. We told them that we need them 
to help us care for our place." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood is located in the heart of a city where there were a record 
48 gang-related homicides in 1993, more than double the number in any previous 
year in the city's history. 
</P>
<P>
 The three priests have presided over the funerals of eight victims of 
gang-related violence from their parish, which encompasses the turf claimed by 
five gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those killed last year was 17-year-old Alex Cordova, victim of a 
drive-by shooting on North Garfield Street on New Year's Eve, 1992, two months 
after the outreach meetings began. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordova had been among the first gang members to attend the gatherings, and 
his death had a profound impact on his friends, many of whom then began 
attending the weekly meetings in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot has changed," said one 17-year-old, Cordova's best friend, who asked 
that his name not be published because he fears retaliation. "I realized that 
once you're dead, you can't come back. I saw Alex's mom suffer and I didn't 
want to see my mom suffer like that." 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as two weeks ago, a car drove by and several shots were fired from 
it into the crowd as the group was gathering for one of their meetings. No one 
was hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been so much heartache," said volunteer Anne Roth. "We've watched six 
kids (from the neighborhood) die in a year and some I knew very well. That's 
been the hardest part, actually losing the kids and realizing the present 
danger that continues to face the kids still with us." 
</P>
<P>
 The priests admit that it has been difficult, and sometimes impossible, to 
reach some of the more violent, hard-core gangbangers, many of whom are 
constantly in and out of jail or juvenile hall. 
</P>
<P>
 But, they remain undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have a commitment to the long haul," said Brendan Smith. "It can 
easily be discouraging if you are looking for immediate results and if you try 
and approach it as only you having something to give them. It's more of a 
mutual learning from each other."

NFL DECISION ON TELECASTS MAY LEAVE SPORTS BARS SCRAMBLING; FOOTBALL: COUNTY 
BISTROS WOULD BE AMONG THOSE HAVING TO PAY UP OR LOSE GAMES WHEN ARE SCRAMBLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 On fall Sundays, the ritual repeats itself in bars and restaurants from Dana 
Point to Newport Beach to Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans decked out in the colors of their "hometown" team -- Bears, Cowboys and 
49ers, among others -- huddle in clusters, sipping beer while watching National 
Football League games that they can't see at home because they don't own a 
satellite dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Come next season, the ritual may undergo a radical transformation, changing 
the viewing habits of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 11, the NFL announced plans to "scramble" its satellite signals, 
meaning that fans hoping to watch out-of-market games will have to shoulder a 
new expense. Tavern and restaurant owners -- as well as homeowners who own 
satellite systems -- will pay a season subscription fee to have the games 
"unscrambled." 
</P>
<P>
 League officials say the cost will be reasonable, although a price scale has 
not been determined. However, sources within the NFL said individual dish 
owners would pay as much as $150 a year, while bars and restaurants would be 
charged up to several thousand dollars, depending on size. 
</P>
<P>
 The news has jarred dozens of businesses, which may post a cover charge just 
to show the games that draw the bulk of their clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty soon, watching a football game in a place like ours will be like going 
to a movie," said Steven Zeller, general manager of Legends, a Costa Mesa 
sports bar and restaurant. "You'll pay an admission price." 
</P>
<P>
 "It definitely makes it tough," said Jim Maresca, general manager of Charley 
Brown's, an Anaheim sports restaurant. "We may not be able to show those games 
any more." 
</P>
<P>
 "It epitomizes the greed mentality of the NFL owners, and all it's doing is 
hurting the little entrepreneurs -- like me -- who are trying to run a 
business," said Don Myers, managing partner of the Catch Seafood and Sports 
Grill near Anaheim Stadium. "It's just another shot to the head of the fan . . 
. the little guy they don't seem to care about." 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL's scrambling policy will have no effect on fans watching games on 
their network affiliates at home. Area stations will still carry the Rams, 
Raiders and other teams free. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the growing popularity of professional football and America's growth 
as a mobile society, satellite technology has given transplanted fans from 
Chicago, Dallas, New York and other cities the chance to follow their favorite 
teams while living in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to have a devastating effect, not just on our business but on 
the Orange County economy on the whole, especially on weekends," said Myers of 
the Catch, who hopes a budding protest will force a reasonable fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County merchants have not ruled out a boycott of Anheuser-Busch and 
Miller brewing companies, a strategy that worked in 1990 when the league 
threatened to scramble televised games without offering a subscription 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 That effort was led by San Diego restaurateur Norman Lebovitz, who formed the 
Assn. for Sports Fans' Rights as the umbrella organization behind the boycott 
that targeted the NFL's biggest sponsors. Lebovitz's crusade prompted network 
TV executives to fly him to New York in conjunction with the league canceling 
plans to scramble. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, Lebovitz came to a gathering of satellite dealers at the Anaheim 
Convention Center to drum up support for his organization, which has a 
toll-free number and, he said, the backing of more than 20,000 sports bars and 
restaurants nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 A potential member is Alan Fronke, owner of the National Sports Grill in Buena 
Park, who said, "I will use whatever means necessary to ensure my customers of 
getting to see the games they came to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Fronke has begun building new outlets in Fullerton and Torrance, based 
largely, he said, on the drawing power of NFL Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't afford to lose that business," he said. "It's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
 Sports bars such as Fronke's -- which features four satellite dishes, 44 
television monitors and two "big screens," all showing professional sports -- 
have cropped up in cities across the country and, in his view, created a 
subculture that lives and breathes for pro football on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a subculture that will now foot the bill, with Fronke saying the cost may 
have to be passed along by higher prices for drinks and food. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what irks San Diego's Lebovitz, who said "we already have plans" for a 
boycott. "We hope not to use it, but it's obvious they're trying to figure out 
how much they can squeeze -- and get away with." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was told at the Anaheim gathering that the NFL may charge some 
businesses as much as $8,000 a year for the right to show out-of-market games, 
a cost he considers prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NFL should remember that the Assn. for Sports Fans' Rights was created 
out of its arrogance, so do they want to continue to promote it by remaining 
arrogant with the sports fan? If they do," he said, "then so be it. We've got 
something to battle. Sports fans are the most under-represented group in 
America, and this is the proof." 
</P>
<P>
 Tola Murphy-Baran, a former satellite executive with the Showtime movie 
channel, has just been hired by the NFL to make the plan a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy-Baran said the league is aware that, perhaps more than any area of the 
country, Southern California is made up largely of transplanted fans who 
continue to root for teams other than the Rams, Raiders and San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 From the NFL's perspective, bar and restaurant owners have -- until now -- 
obtained the league's copyrighted signals for free and earned profits from 
greater patronage. 
</P>
<P>
 She said subscriptions will actually help business owners because NFL 
paraphernalia and signage will adorn their establishments, creating a kind of 
NFL super-store each Sunday. Murphy-Baran is an executive of the newly created 
NFL Enterprises, which will govern the home and commercial satellite market; in 
essence, minding the super-store. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our desire is to drive business into their establishments -- not away from 
them," she said of the Orange County circuit. "I probably can't allay their 
fears until I quote them a price, and then their fears will be allayed." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all bar and restaurant owners oppose the new system. "I'm glad to see it," 
said John Morris, who owns Legends in Costa Mesa. "It's long overdue. As long 
as it's reasonably priced, I have no problem with it. Now I'll be able to 
advertise and promote what we offer. It legitimizes our business." 
</P>
<P>
 But many remain skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 The manager of an Irvine sports bar, who asked not to be quoted by name, said 
scrambling by the National Basketball Assn. had made its games harder to get 
via satellite, lowering the demand among a once-rabid clientele. She predicts 
the same will happen with the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will have a major impact -- a major negative impact," she said. 
"Not so much for us, but for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy-Baran disagreed, noting that the NBA imposes "territorial 
restrictions," meaning most out-of-market games are unavailable. Major League 
Baseball follows a similar policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL will impose no such restrictions, she said, except for sustaining the 
home-team blackout rule. In other words, if the Rams fail to sell out 72 hours 
before kickoff at Anaheim Stadium, their games won't be available in Orange 
County, even on satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 Fronke of Buena Park worries that a hefty fee will eliminate "a lot of small 
people. Believe me, Joe's Bar and Grill won't be able to afford thousands of 
dollars, if, indeed, it ends up being that. In the past, they've gotten it all 
for free, and the NFL hasn't suffered a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 "Any way you look at it," said Myers of the Catch, "it hurts the fan the most. 
He doesn't benefit a bit. And anyone who says he does is crazy. The NFL just 
signed a new television contract for more than $1 billion. How much money does 
it need, for gosh sakes? When is enough finally enough?"

TINY DISTRICT TO TAP INTO BASE'S WATER SUPPLY; AGREEMENT: TRI-CITIES' PACT WITH 
MARINES WILL GIVE IT ACCESS TO BASIN BENEATH CREEK AT CAMP PENDLETON. BUT 
CRITICS SAY THE UTILITY IS TRYING TO BUY ITSELF A FUTURE WITH TAXPAYERS' MONEY. 
</P>

<P>
 A tiny South County water district has forged a unique agreement with the 
Marine Corps to share Camp Pendleton's water supply, but critics say the 
district is making the move to save itself from extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente's Tri-Cities Municipal Water District and the Marines have agreed 
to share the high-quality water beneath San Mateo Creek at the northern edge of 
the base. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement gives the district something most South County water agencies 
lack: a local supply of water that can be tapped in emergencies and a water 
basin available for storage. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first time in Camp Pendleton's 52-year history that the military has 
agreed to this type of civilian partnership. Although an official document has 
not yet been signed, officials said that is only a formality. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still some mechanics to be worked out in the next several weeks . . 
. but we think this is a very positive thing to be doing," said Col. Steve 
Fisher, Camp Pendleton's community planning and liaison officer. "We want to be 
a good neighbor and partner in the region . . . and this is a great win-win 
situation for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for access to the underground basin, the district will drill the 
wells, build the infrastructure to distribute the water and pay for the deal, 
an amount estimated at $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal's critics -- including one Tri-Cities board member -- claim the 
district is trying to buy itself a future with taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
 And while endorsing the concept of the project, some South County officials 
say Tri-Cities is spending too much for a district that is a target for 
consolidation as the county pushes to merge certain government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Grand Jury is studying whether Tri-Cities should merge with 
the county's three other water agencies that wholesale water to districts that 
serve customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is the board is trying to save this district by making this 
project so essential they can perpetuate Tri-Cities Municipal Water District," 
Tri-Cities board member Ray Benedicktus said. "I'm not knocking the concept, 
but there's a lot of facts we still need to study." 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente Mayor Scott Diehl agreed, urging the Tri-Cities board to slow 
down. At a recent Tri-Cities board meeting, Diehl told the directors he does 
not want his city's taxpayers stuck with the bill if the district goes away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are nervous about the agreement," Diehl told the board. "If there is a big 
financial burden put on Tri-Cities, ultimately it will come to us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Board President William C. Mecham said the positive aspects of the project far 
outweigh criticism. He emphasized that the water will cost less, in the long 
run, than water from other sources. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever costs are incurred by the district will be returned to us in the 
form of water," Mecham said. "That's a very important asset." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only will the basin offer the district a new local water supply, but it 
would also give its 70,000 South County customers an emergency supply of water 
if an earthquake or flood damaged a pipeline, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 South County now depends on water from the Colorado River and Northern 
California that is imported by pipelines susceptible to earthquakes, said 
Dennis Erdman, a former Tri-Cities director credited with launching the San 
Mateo Creek effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are drastically short of storage in the area," said Erdman, now the 
manager of a water district in Mammoth Lakes. "There is not enough storage 
combined in the cities of Dana Point and San Clemente for more than a five-day 
supply, so who knows what would happen after an earthquake. The prospect of 
70,000 people without water is pretty frightening." 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated capacity of the San Mateo basin, about 2,000 acre-feet of water, 
could provide several months of water in an emergency, Erdman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency capabilities helped persuade the Marines to approve the project, 
Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last winter, the 50,000 Marines and civilians who work and live at the 
125,000-acre Camp Pendleton were left without water when floods tainted the 
base's water treatment plants, Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "After our experience last year, I've been convinced this makes sense," Fisher 
said, adding that Tri-Cities will also take on the job of tapping and 
maintaining the underground basin, as well as distributing it in the northern 
portion of the base. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The project has won praise from officials of the vast Metropolitan Water 
District of Southern California, the state's powerful water supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing a dwindling water supply, MWD officials have urged local districts to 
begin tapping into local supplies and have even promised to pay some of the 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 John V. Foley of Laguna Niguel, MWD's board chairman, said similar projects 
are underway to use underground basins around the state. But no one has worked 
with the Marines like Tri-Cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a wonderful thing to pull together, and (Tri-Cities) deserves a lot 
of credit," said Foley, who is also the general manager of the Moulton Niguel 
Water District. "In the long haul, we just have to encourage local development. 
It's just one more source of water we need to explore."

MARKETING THE MORGUE; BUSINESS: INTEREST AND SALES IN CORONER'S OFFICE 
SOUVENIRS IS BOOMING. BUT CRITICS SAY THE PRODUCTS DEMEAN THE CITY'S IMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 No one thought the idea would take off. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, when Marilyn Lewis proposed that the county coroner's office sell 
souvenirs to raise money for the department she had a ready defense: "I'm a 
secretary, not some marketing whiz. What do I know?" 
</P>
<P>
 But after People, Newsweek, Life, CNN and "Good Morning America" ran stories, 
take off it did. Although no one is calling it the marketing coup of the 
century, the sale of personalized toe tags and beach towels emblazoned with the 
outline of a body is big and about to get bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors recently approved a deal to market the products in 
Canada and now at least two Japanese companies have expressed interest. In 
coming days, coroner's officials will choose between one of two firms bidding 
for domestic rights. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials believe that if they play their cards right the deals will 
rake in as much as $1 million a year, with the money to be used for the 
coroner's youth diversion programs, in which troubled teen-agers tour the 
morgue as an incentive to change their ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever we do with it, however big it gets, it does show we can make money 
and do something worthwhile without raising taxes," said Lewis, a 30-year 
county worker who joined the coroner's staff three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Tagged the resident marketing guru, she fairly twinkles when discussing what 
has become a major part of her duties. One of her favorite stories is about the 
tourists from Alabama who wanted to visit the "gift shop" and finding that it 
consisted of a closet outside the executive offices, still insisted on snapping 
pictures of each other in front of the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 The rising popularity of the paraphernalia has boosted the image and morale of 
the coroner's staff, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People had lived with that negative attitude the department had, of dealing 
with death and dying," Lewis said. "Now we're known for something else as well 
and a lot of people say it humanizes us." 
</P>
<P>
 But the booming business in the macabre inevitably raises questions of what, 
if anything, the whole thing says about Los Angeles. Are civic leaders pushing 
an image of the city as a violent mecca? There is no doubt that the Los Angeles 
County coroner holds a mystique for many because of its investigation of 
celebrity deaths, such as Natalie Wood's and John Belushi's. The popular 
television show "Quincy" was patterned on department operations and former 
coroner Thomas T. Noguchi became famous as the "coroner to the stars" before he 
was forced out in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 But many see the morgue humor as inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles is already known as a capital of crime, for its high death rate, 
for gang murders; we ought not to (perpetuate) that by having skeletons and 
bodies on a beach towel," Supervisor Ed Edelman said. "We open ourselves up to 
losing more than we gain and continue the idea that somehow L.A. is a dangerous 
place to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman said the souvenirs are probably not such innocent fun for the families 
and friends of loved ones whose violent or accidental deaths were investigated 
by the coroner. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside of Los Angeles, the concept has elicited snide rebukes. A similar 
merchandising plan was considered in Houston, but was rejected by the coroner 
there as "positively unprofessional and grossly insensitive to the victims' 
next of kin." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not Los Angeles County, a place where the macabre is the stuff movies 
are made of," sniffed an editorialist for the Houston Chronicle. "This is 
Harris County, where common sense, but more importantly, respect for human life 
still applies." 
</P>
<P>
 But for Lewis, none of the criticisms wash. She sees herself as everywoman, a 
sober, middle-class mother, albeit with a weird sense of humor, who ought to 
know what is and isn't offensive. Death, and the often-attendant coroner, are a 
part of life that one cannot wave away, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think those people sound awfully stuffy; they're not willing to try 
something different or new ideas," she said while sitting in her neat office on 
the grounds of County-USC Medical Center and fielding calls from people asking 
how to find the gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Death is awfully scary, but maybe something like this helps us tolerate 
things a little easier," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Sherwin, director of media relations for the Los Angeles Convention and 
Visitors Bureau, said there is phenomenal interest domestically and 
internationally in the darker aspects of Los Angeles culture, as exhibited in 
the popularity of the celebrity graveside tours. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole project with the coroner falls into that," Sherwin said. "So I 
don't see it as distracting visitors from coming. It's another one of those 
kooky things in L.A. that makes it so great." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not only tourists who are interested. Donna Haworth, an insurance 
investigator from Norco, dropped by the souvenir closet after a court 
appearance. She bought a T-shirt decorated with a skeleton called Sherlock 
Bones, a sweat shirt and beach towel ("blood red on purpose") with the 
ever-popular outline of a body, a tote bag and two toe tag key chains that bear 
a don't-drink-and-drive inscription. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what it does in a humorous way is pushes a serious message and the 
money goes to a good purpose," Haworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, in casual operation for about a year, took off last summer. Since 
September, Skeletons in the Closet (the official name of the merchandising 
operation) has sold nearly 10,000 items, about half through its mail-order 
service. The other half is sold to people who wander up to the second-floor 
closet. ("We don't allow tours anymore or encourage people to come by, but when 
somebody does find their way there it seems kind of rude to turn them away," 
Lewis said). The most popular items are the Sherlock Bones T-shirts, the beach 
towels and toe tags. 
</P>
<P>
 But also available are authentic Department of Coroner lapel pins, stylish ink 
pens bearing the coroner's seal, an elegant beveled glass wall clock, and the 
newest item, a rather nifty-looking wristwatch with the body outline on the 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 Dusty Brogan, a marketing specialist with the county Beaches and Harbors 
Department who is coordinating the coroner's marketing plans, said the county 
plans to control how its merchandise is promoted even after it goes global. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county really has to maintain a professional image and make sure that 
everything stays within the boundaries of good taste," she said, adding that 
all contracts give the county final approval of products and designs. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, she and others see a limitless potential. "I think the Japanese 
market will be strong and the Australian market as well," she said. "We've had 
some letters from Europe, but I don't know if we could consolidate rights 
there."

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; RIDING HERD ON DISASTER CLAIMS; INSURANCE: 
WHEREVER CATASTROPHE STRIKES, ADJUSTERS ARE THERE. THEY INVESTIGATE DAMAGES AND 
SOOTHE FRAZZLED NERVES. 
</P>

<P>
 His first storm was Hurricane Alicia in Houston, 1983. He forged friendships 
during the Oakland fire of 1991 and renewed them the next March during the 
hailstorm in Orlando, Fla. He would have gone to Hawaii after Hurricane Iniki 
but he was too busy in Miami in the wake of Hurricane Andrew. On the morning of 
Jan. 17, even his mechanic in Peterborough, Ontario, knew where Geoff Montreuil 
was headed next. "He said: 'Aren't you going to Los Angeles?' I said what for? 
He said: 'They just had an earthquake.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Within 24 hours, Montreuil was indeed in Los Angeles, negotiating the insides 
of quake-broken houses and ministering to their shaken residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreuil, an insurance adjuster for ITT Hartford, is one of the cowboys of 
the industry. He and his colleagues move from one disaster to another, 
descending within hours of the devastation and staying on for weeks, even 
months, often shepherding a claim from the first on-site inspection all the way 
to the rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake has sparked tens of thousands of insurance claims. 
(State Farm has nearly 80,000.) So that means armies of insurance adjusters 
will be camping out in Los Angeles long after the aftershocks subside. You may 
have seen them: men and women in polo shirts and jackets, all emblazoned with 
insurance company logos and some variation on the disaster theme like Special 
Disaster Team or Emergency Claim Service. 
</P>
<P>
 At the elegant Biltmore Hotel, where hundreds of State Farm adjusters are 
holed up, you can see them in the early evening in the lobby: Amid the usual 
crowd of European-suited men and high-heel-shod women, the insurance adjusters 
amble in, wearing bright red-and-white shirts, boxes of files under their arms, 
fatigue etched in their faces. 
</P>
<P>
 But forget about number-crunching paper-pushers -- even though they do have to 
furrow through all those files at some spare moment. For these "stormers," as 
they sometimes call themselves, the tools of the trade are tape measures, 
flashlights, cameras and fold-up wooden ladders -- "everything you would need 
to go under, over or through a house," State Farm's Rick Cleaves said. Their 
ever-present cellular phones are practically holstered to their waists. 
</P>
<P>
 Few resemble elite athletes, but many can climb a ladder and casually walk a 
slanted tile roof with a clipboard in one hand and a tape measure in the other. 
They get as excited as astronomers discovering a supernova when they uncover 
some exotic destruction wrought by a storm -- their catchall term for every 
disaster. "You'll see structural damage you'll never see at home," said 
Cleaves, who left his 2-year-old daughter and five months' pregnant wife -- 
also a State Farm claims adjuster -- home in Oklahoma for his monthlong stay in 
Los Angeles. "It's unlikely I'm going to see earthquake damage in Tulsa." 
</P>
<P>
 Spouses learn to cope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've eaten insurance every night of my life for 26 years," said Louise 
Corbin, whose husband, Joel, 52, is an adjuster and co-supervisor for ITT 
Hartford from nearby Fullerton. "I've learned it's a priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Some expect to be here as long as six months. (The Corbins have already 
invited some adjusters to Easter dinner.) "If they're rebuilding their house, 
you're with them the whole way," ITT Hartford's Martina Graham said. They move 
into hotels and apartments and inevitably stay long enough to celebrate 
birthdays, anniversaries and holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleaves had been home from the Malibu fires for only two weeks when he got the 
call. "I've never said no," said Cleaves, 37, who is scrupulously polite and 
preternaturally disposed to calling every adult woman "Ma'am." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They do it for a mix of reasons -- starting with the fact that it is not a 
desk job. Like soldiers seeing the world, they speak wistfully of time spent in 
Malibu (the fires) or Hawaii (the hurricane.) 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll see an 'insured' who's an accountant, who works all day at a desk," 
said Montreuil, who for as long as he can remember has wanted only to follow in 
the footsteps of his insurance adjuster father, "and I'll think, 'God, that's 
so boring.' " 
</P>
<P>
 There is also extra money to be made. State Farm pays $50 a weekday above 
salary and $100 a day above salary for weekend days on storm duty -- which is 
always a voluntary assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the adjusters pride themselves on being part investigator -- especially in 
an earthquake that can leave covert damage -- and part psychologist to 
distraught insureds. "We get to hold their hands, hug them, give them money," 
Cleaves said, "and help them to get their lives back in order a little bit that 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 They would not seem likely candidates for canonization. "My mother still feels 
like insurance companies are thieves," said Graham, 34, who has worked for ITT 
Hartford for seven years. "Sometimes I leave someone's house with the feeling 
that I've done everything I possibly could . . . and they still think I'm 
trying to cheat them." 
</P>
<P>
 And because earthquake policies are usually written with high deductibles (10% 
of a home's value is common) that leaves a fair amount of room for 
confrontations between an adjuster and policyholder. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to vent," Graham said. "It's part of the job." 
</P>
<P>
 But adjusters insist that if there is any benefit of the doubt, they give it 
to the policyholder. "Our philosophy with Hartford is we go out and look for 
ways to pay it," Hartford's Ray Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Or let them down kindly: "I sort of ease into discussing their policy with 
them," said Montreuil, who has dabbled in politics in Ontario. "I think the 
real accomplishment is to go out there, explain their coverage and leave as a 
friend." 
</P>
<P>
 He should know. "I've had people from Florida call me because they have a 
claim after Hurricane Andrew for a water pipe that burst -- they call me in 
Ottawa -- 1,500 miles away! They want me to handle the claim." 
</P>
<P>
 In place of home and hearth, these insurance adjusters develop something of a 
disaster fraternity -- they bond with each other and keep in touch via 
electronic computer messages between disasters. When they walk into a hotel at 
a disaster site, it is like walking into a reunion. "We're like a big family," 
said Davidson, 46, who has worked with Montreuil and Corbin for years. 
</P>
<P>
 They consult with each other on claims, they live together in hotel suites, 
they eat together, they look for a place to relax together. At the beginning of 
a catastrophe, there is virtually no time off. "When you're coming into a fresh 
disaster, you don't have a social life," one said. But gradually, there is a 
weekend day or two off. Although companies fly spouses in or adjusters home for 
a few days, most of the time there is just the work and their compatriots. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Women are a minority among the adjusters, and some male homeowners have been 
known to run outside in disbelief when they see Linda Jarvis, a State Farm 
adjuster, climbing onto their roof. On rare occasions, Jarvis, who leads a team 
of quake adjusters, encounters resistance from male colleagues. During 
Hurricane Andrew, an adjuster -- one of the "old guard," she said, called her 
"Sugar Buns" during a phone conversation. "I let it go," said Jarvis, a 
51-year-old, lean-framed grandmother who went canoeing past alligators on one 
of her days off while working the hurricane. "I said he wouldn't have said it 
if he'd seen me in person." 
</P>
<P>
 Camaraderie is usually the rule. Over dinner near their hotel in the San 
Fernando Valley, half a dozen ITT Hartford disaster teammates told stories of 
borrowing ties and renting a limousine to go to dinner in San Francisco when 
they were working the Oakland fires. "If we'd had to drive, the parking fees 
for all our cars would have been as much as we spent on the limo," Geoff 
Montreuil said. When they finally get a weekend off earthquake duty, they may 
go to Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 But never were they more close-knit than during Hurricane Iniki in late 
summer, 1992 -- when they lived in condos in Kauai for weeks without 
electricity or hot water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Iniki was my first disaster away from home," Graham said. "To me it was like 
this big adventure. We were camping out. We were in the trenches." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no escaping the idyllic surroundings, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "I brought my Boogie board to Hawaii," Davidson said. "We'd have dinner, 
drinks, go to the beach -- it was as long as two or three football fields. The 
beach was ours." 
</P>
<P>
 There was an unsuccessful attempt to find a nude beach as well. Like a secret 
society, they vowed not to divulge any other Hawaii-based antics. "We made a 
pact," said Graham, whose promotion last fall to general adjuster was 
celebrated by the group when they were at the Laguna Beach fires.  
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, adjusters do what other new arrivals do. They go to CityWalk. 
Or, as in the case of Cleaves and a friend, they drive determinedly into the 
hills in an attempt to get close to the Hollywood sign. (They didn't make it 
all the way.) 
</P>
<P>
 After 12-hour days of dealing with the disaster-struck, they admit to some 
drinking -- but insist that their biggest vice is eating too much (and 
exercising almost not at all.) 
</P>
<P>
 But they are not hitting Spago or the Ivy, and they eschew room service. Like 
frugal tourists on an extended vacation, they become connoisseurs of big meals 
at low prices -- at restaurants they can walk to. After hours of driving each 
day, they are loathe to get behind the wheel for a dinner excursion. They look 
to cops for restaurant advice: "When policemen tell you where to go, you know 
it's good food," Cleaves said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Cleaves walked out of his Downtown hotel to a nearby restaurant and found 
it closed, a homeless man offered to give him a good alternative if Cleaves 
gave him a buck. He did, and the man recommended The Pantry. "Best one dollar 
I've ever spent," Cleaves said. 
</P>
<P>
 Every now and then, someone attempts to cook. Jarvis crammed everyone into her 
Oakwood apartment and made a meal of chicken, noodles and corn bread. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham, who usually works alone in San Jose, welcomes the close society that 
develops around a disaster. "I don't have that office socializing. That's why 
it's nice to be out here," she said, hitting the road for a day of 
appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Graham occasionally has to fend off a rude comment from a male 
colleague, most of the intractability she faces comes from male policyholders. 
"They always ask: 'How long have you been doing this?' When I tell them seven 
years, they quiet down."  
</P>
<P>
 She pulled up to an immaculate house in Van Nuys. A 57-year-old man, a mason 
by profession, showed Graham around the house as she pulled out a tape measure 
and got down on her knees to scrutinize the earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "This door was completely jammed shut," said the man, who asked not to be 
identified.  
</P>
<P>
 Graham examined the door, now hanging crookedly by its hinges. "The frame is 
fine," she said. "The door just needs to be rehung." 
</P>
<P>
 The man stared at her skeptically. "How long have you been doing this?" 
</P>
<P>
 "About seven years," she said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 But insurance adjusters' days in Los Angeles are filled not just with 
fractured foundations and tweaked doors. As Graham drove away from the 
Jorgensons' house, she was musing on one of her more unusual assignments. 
Forest Lawn had filed a claim for damage to a statue of David. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham didn't blink. "I have to go out and look at his little foot and see 
what needs to be done."

SPACE SHUTTLE PUZZLE; ARE ENGINE MOCK-UPS IN THE SMITHSONIAN OR IN A PALMDALE 
DUMP? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Depending on whom you believe, an important part of this country's space 
exploration history is either in the Smithsonian Institution or decaying in the 
hot sun in a Palmdale landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 Space shuttle builder Rockwell International says it sent a set of shuttle 
engine mock-ups -- huge nozzles used in the test program for the Enterprise, 
the first orbiter built -- to the dump more than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But the objects Rockwell says were dumped sound just like what the National 
Air and Space Museum in Washington believes it has in its collection. The 
museum says the nozzles are still attached to the back of the Enterprise, a 
non-flying orbiter used for testing in the late 1970s that was donated by the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration to the museum in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The mock-ups were used in approach and landing tests that included putting the 
Enterprise atop a modified 747 and releasing it 26,000 feet above the expansive 
dry lake beds at Edwards Air Force Base to see if it could glide to an 
unpowered landing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell officials said just one set of the mock-ups were built -- and they 
are at the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the real approach and landing nozzles are out there in California, then 
what do we have?" asked Valerie Neal, a curator for the museum's department of 
space history. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Valentino, who has been general manager of the Palmdale dump for nearly 
two decades, said the three shuttle engine nozzles -- which were designed to 
simulate the size, shape and weight of the real space shuttle main engines -- 
arrived at the landfill several years ago during the town's annual cleanup 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell, which builds the space shuttles at its facility at Air Force Plant 
42 in Palmdale, no longer had a use for the nozzles and so, with the blessing 
of the government, disposed of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than storing them, because they have no functional value or purpose 
down the line, Rockwell and NASA property managers decided to dispose of them," 
said Alan Buis, a spokesman for Rockwell Space Systems Division. "That's how 
they ended up where they currently are." 
</P>
<P>
 But museum curator Neal is confident that Rockwell is mistaken about what it 
sent to the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to a couple people who were here when Enterprise was delivered," she 
said. "We were never notified that anything on Enterprise was not part of the 
test configuration." 
</P>
<P>
 If Rockwell is right, however, historians and museum curators fear that a 
piece of history is weathering in the desert sun, in a dump, no less. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is disturbing," said Derek Elliott, who was curator of the Air and Space 
Museum's manned space collection at the time Enterprise arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott, now a history professor at Tennessee State University in Nashville, 
said that when Enterprise was given to the museum, no one thought to ask if the 
nozzles were the ones used in the tests at Edwards AFB. It was just assumed 
they were. 
</P>
<P>
 Through an agreement between NASA and the Smithsonian, NASA is supposed to 
offer anything considered a potential artifact to the museum before discarding 
it. It is possible that when the nozzles were dumped, the process broke down, 
Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if we didn't acquire them, I can almost guarantee some other space 
history museum or center would be interested in something like that," he said. 
"It's part of this nation's history, the history of the space shuttle." 
</P>
<P>
 But items that historians and curators believe significant are not always 
judged as such by others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not unique that you found engine mock-ups in a dump in California," said 
James Hartsfield, NASA shuttle program spokesman at the Johnson Space Center in 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Various junked mock-ups from the Apollo program can be found at landfills near 
the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Palmdale landfill manager Valentino is not all that eager to give 
up what he sees as his piece of space history. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has never been sure exactly what they were, he has kept the 
mock-ups from being buried under tons of grass clippings, tin cans and used 
tires. They sit near an old, discarded dinghy and appear to be used as a 
resting place and toilet facility for the many birds that frequent the 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 It may not be the Smithsonian, but Valentino says he is eventually going to 
put the three engine nozzles on display and show them during tours.

TV HEROES DRAW 35,000 TO UNIVERSAL; ENTERTAINMENT: THE RUSH BY CHILDREN AND 
THEIR PARENTS TO SEE THE MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS SURPRISES AMUSEMENT PARK 
OFFICIALS. FREEWAY SNARL STRETCHES FOR MILES.

<P>
 Six characters in crayon-colored spandex drew thousands of excited kids to 
Universal Studios on Monday. And the young enthusiasts dragged along their 
parents, creating an eight-mile-long traffic jam that stretched all the way to 
Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The grown-ups endured the Presidents' Day freeway ordeal, and then, once 
inside the grounds, faced long waits in line with their children anxiously 
bobbing at their sides. Then they got to shell out $29.95 per adult and $23.95 
per child over the age of 3 for admission -- plus $6 for parking. 
</P>
<P>
 To see whom? 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, of course. Those same television 
super-heroes who outdrew Santa Claus at a San Fernando Valley shopping mall 
last Christmas. Sort of the pre-adolescents' equivalent of the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a parent's worst nightmare," said Betty Ushie, stuck in her car on 
the Hollywood Freeway just before the Lankershim Boulevard exit. Ushie said the 
typical 20-minute trip from Culver City to Universal Studios took her more than 
an hour Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet her 9-year-old son Ada appeared oblivious to his mother's frustrations as 
he explained why he had begged her to take him to see the Power Rangers, 
teen-age karate experts who vanquish foes every weeknight at 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the characters . . . they're cool," Ada Ushie said. "I try and watch 
them every day." 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated crowd of 35,000 -- close to a 30-year attendance record at 
Universal Studios -- caught even the amusement park by surprise. It hastily 
moved the Power Rangers from a small theater into the 6,000-seat Universal 
Amphitheatre for six shows. The entrance fee included admission to the entire 
amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
 Lines began forming outside Universal Studios at 7 a.m., three hours before 
the first show. A kiosk offering Power Rangers merchandise was closed within 
seconds after it opened "because the crowd mobbed it," said Universal spokesman 
Jim Yeager, who brought his 7-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son to the show. 
The kiosk was reopened after staffing was beefed up, and merchandise began 
"selling as fast as we put it out."  
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anything like it," Yeager said of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles didn't draw this well. 
</P>
<P>
 The stars of the top-rated children's TV show performed flips and other 
gymnastics to promote the Drug Abuse Resistance Education program. Universal 
Studios Hollywood donated $15,000 to the anti-drug education program plus an 
unspecified portion of proceeds from the sale of Power Rangers merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 But getting there was as difficult as battling Rita Repulsa, the Empress of 
Evil and chief nemesis of the Power Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic was backed up for five miles on the northbound Hollywood Freeway as 
parents and their children headed for Universal. The Lankershim Boulevard and 
Universal Center Drive off-ramps were closed because the Universal City parking 
lots were nearly full. 
</P>
<P>
 Ushie shook her head when asked whether she would have braved the trip to 
Universal City had she known of the traffic disaster that lay ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not have come or I would have started earlier," Ushie said. 
</P>
<P>
 But getting an early start was no consolation to Jenny Romero of Lynwood, 
whose Ford Aerostar broke down just before the Lankershim exit about 9 a.m., 
leaving her and her three children and four nieces and nephews stranded. For 
Romero and her family, Monday's trip to see the Power Rangers became a lesson 
in broken dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was my day to meet them," said Jimy Tamayo, 10, Romero's nephew. "Now 
it's blown out of history. I can't meet them anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Some waiting in the endless line of cars on the Hollywood Freeway were 
oblivious as to why traffic was so bad. Even one parking enforcement officer 
was baffled by his assignment to guard the Coral Drive entrance to the studios. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to be kidding me," he yelled when told by a reporter that the 
entrance had been shut because of an onslaught of traffic triggered by the 
Power Rangers performances. "I thought there was a bomb scare or something." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, who realized they shared the same goals as hundreds of other parents 
-- getting their kids to see the Power Rangers -- sat frantically in their cars 
wondering whether a parking space would await them when they finally arrived at 
the studios. 
</P>
<P>
 But Betsy Astor, who brought her 2- and 4-year-old sons to Universal, said the 
long wait was worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Power Rangers are "positive role models," she said. "They have a lot of 
things to say about listening to your parents."

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; REPAIRS ADD STRESS ON CONDO BOARDS; SHELTER: 
ASSOCIATIONS FACE DIVERSE VIEWS ABOUT FIXING DAMAGED STRUCTURES. THE FEAR THAT 
SOME WILL ABANDON THEIR UNITS IS HIGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Peter Elias has faced a few hassles as president of the condominium owners 
association at Villa Saticoy, a 36-unit Tudor-style building in Canoga Park. 
There was a botched paint job around the swimming pool, bruised feelings about 
banning bicycles in the courtyard, and dealings with contractors for a new 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing, absolutely nothing, prepared Elias and his neighbors for the 
complicated and emotionally draining choices posed by the building's severe 
damage in the Northridge earthquake. Now they must decide whether, when and how 
to repair the structure -- and do it all as a group. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, that building and hundreds of others throughout the Los Angeles 
region will test the shared ownership concept of condominium housing on an 
unprecedented scale, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Condominium associations are sometimes likened to representative democracies 
up close and personal. Now their earthquake emergencies could stir poolside 
civil wars in some instances or usher in new good neighbor policies across the 
balconies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot make a decision without 35 other people. If it were just me and my 
spouse, it would be a lot easier to negotiate," said Elias, a supermarket 
manager and part-time mortgage broker. "In this situation, this is everyone's 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest fear is that some unit owners in damaged buildings will abandon 
condominiums that had dropped in value even before the earthquake. If mortgage 
holders refuse to pitch in, remaining owners might have to bear a larger share 
of repair bills, perhaps triggering another cycle of abandonment. All that 
could create messy trails of credit problems, bankuptcies and lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of those concerns, condominium association meetings from 
Northridge to Santa Monica have taken on immense importance and are attracting 
crowds in a way that debates about awning colors never did. Although most 
decisions in the past were handled by buildings' elected boards of directors, 
basic choices on rebuilding usually will require votes by a majority of the 
unit owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other than the boards, it used to be that only two people would show up to 
complain about dogs barking and loud noise. Now everyone is coming out in 
force," said Alan Schimmel, a Sherman Oaks-based attorney who represents Villa 
Saticoy and other associations. "They are realizing they have common interests 
and have big decisions to make." 
</P>
<P>
 And as in all governments, mixtures of solidarity and dissension seem to loom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without a question, this is going to be the biggest test for these 
associations. And frankly, the test is just beginning," said Brian Davidoff, 
president of Ross Morgan and Co., a firm that manages 130 condominium buildings 
in the Los Angeles area, including 40 that suffered quake damage. He predicts 
that about 10% of units in badly damaged buildings will wind up abandoned and 
foreclosed, with legal and financial problems in the wake. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the strong appeal of condominium life -- its mixture of private 
apartments and communal amenities -- will overcome most such difficulties, said 
Kathleen Daniels, Los Angeles area executive director of the Community Assns. 
Institute, an organization that advises condominium boards. The neighborliness 
shown in the first few scary days after Jan. 17 will continue during repair 
decisions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sense is that most people are pulling together and working together to 
solve these problems and perhaps a very, very small percentage are not working 
together," Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk is highest at buildings like Villa Saticoy that had no earthquake 
insurance and now are declared uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a headache. Now we have 36 owners. What if 16 decide to walk and 20 
decide to rebuild?" asked Elias Saleh, an engineer who in 1990 bought a 
two-bedroom unit at Villa Saticoy for $90,000. His older brother Michael, a 
baker, bought a similar apartment in the same complex for $97,000 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saleh brothers were inside the complex recently, sadly surveying cracked 
walls, sunken foundation columns and the scattered trash of hasty evacuations. 
Almost all the apartments were emptied of their furniture after the quake -- a 
good move because city inspectors soon will be changing the warning tag from 
yellow to red, meaning entrance will be forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents are awaiting an architect's report on repair costs. Meanwhile, the 
association is applying for federal grants and loans and unit owners will be 
asking banks to reduce mortgage principals. But if no substantial aid 
materializes, the association may dissolve and let the lenders dispose of the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 No scenario is pleasant, Michael Saleh said. "We are all living paycheck to 
paycheck," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For them and many other condominium owners throughout Southern California, 
apartments with tiny fenced-in patios were a first grip on the American dream. 
They might not have had private yards, but they had tax write-offs and pride of 
ownership. At more affluent complexes, well-to-do singles and seniors who 
traded in single-family homes enjoy luxuries such as tennis courts and avoid 
the headaches of lawn care. 
</P>
<P>
 The much-mentioned "C, C and Rs" -- the covenants, conditions and restrictions 
that control condo life -- differ from building to building. In general, an 
individual's responsibility starts at the paint job of his unit's interior 
walls; the community as a whole usually shares responsibility for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Siegel, a Beverly Hills-based attorney who works with condominium 
associations, said the earthquake crisis has brought out the best: "What I'm 
seeing is a lot of dedicated, devoted people who recognize their obligations 
and are doing what they feel is the right thing for the community." 
</P>
<P>
 It may be months before associations have enough solid information to make 
decisions about repairs and costs. First, insurance adjusters, inspectors, 
architects, lenders and federal aid officials must be consulted and possibly 
argued with.  
</P>
<P>
 With earthquake insurance deductibles often pegged at 10%, repair assessments 
at insured buildings are ranging from $1,000 to more than $10,000 per unit. 
Payments might be required in lump sums or spaced over many years on top of the 
mortgage bills, taxes and association dues. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Saticoy's first association meeting after the quake reportedly was a 
bitter affair, with some owners urging quick abandonment of the building. The 
next, at attorney Schimmel's office, was more subdued; apartment owners, some 
with their babies in tow, listened to President Elias and other board members 
outline various financial strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to act as a community here," Schimmel urged the group. An economic 
fault line in that building and others is evident. On one side are people who 
have sizable equity in their condominiums and will be more willing to pay for 
repairs. On the other are people who don't and won't. 
</P>
<P>
 At buildings with less drastic damage, owners are reminded that they all will 
share repair bills even if their units were not affected by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the message association President Arthur Rosenberg is getting across 
at Encino Oaks, a condominium complex of 10 buildings, 509 units and about 
1,200 residents all linked by wooden bridges and lush landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 Encino Oaks units are now vacant, either through inspectors' orders 
or owners' safety fears. Many other apartments show damage, including 
Rosenberg's, where a bedroom wall has cracked open. 
</P>
<P>
 Architects and engineers estimated that all repairs will cost $9.5 million. 
That frightens residents until they learn that their insurance coverage has 
only a 5% deductible. Each unit owner will be assessed $2,600 on average, due 
in total in a year. Still, some are squawking. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg and his fellow directors took the carrot and stick approach in a 
recent newsletter. "We will all need to tighten our belts for a time, but in 
the end, the rewards should outweigh the drawbacks," they wrote.  
</P>
<P>
 Less certain of survival is Villa Saticoy. A preliminary estimate suggested 
that repairs might total $500,000, or about $13,000 per unit. But many owners 
believe that an upcoming survey will find much greater damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Elias, the president, is urging patience. He bought his two-bedroom unit with 
a loft for $125,000 four years ago and lived there with his wife and two young 
children. After the earthquake, they rented a Woodland Hills townhouse, sharing 
it with a Saticoy neighbor. Wider bonds among neighbors are sure to be tested 
in months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be interesting," he said, "when it comes down to the final 
vote."

 The City Council last week picked Commercial Building Co. over seven other 
contractors to provide janitorial services to City Hall and other city 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana-based company's winning bid of $15,000 a year was $8,000 lower 
than the city's previous contract with another janitorial company, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to City Hall, the janitorial firm will clean the council chambers, 
finance and engineering offices, the youth and community centers and restrooms 
at Laurel Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Six other companies submitted bids for the contract in November, according to 
Public Services Director M. Victor Rollinger. BERT ELJERA

 The City Council is considering putting up more signs to make sure motorists 
do not park their vehicles and block street sweepers. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has received complaints from out-of-town visitors who say inadequate 
signage has caused them to be ticketed for parking in temporarily restricted 
zones. 
</P>
<P>
 At last week's council meeting, officials acknowledged that some city streets 
have only one sign to inform drivers not to park in certain areas during 
street-sweeping hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little underhanded," Councilman Larry A. Herman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to trick anybody. We are a small city, and we want to welcome 
visitors and not hit them with a $22 ticket." 
</P>
<P>
 The city issues about seven parking tickets per day, contributing about 
$38,000 annually to city coffers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A council committee will make recommendations to the council about signage 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, the council reviewed proposed increases in user fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Such fees for specific services that only benefit those who use them account 
for about 9%, or $430,000, of the city's general revenue fund. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, hikes in user fees usually bring in between $10,000 and $12,000 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Fees for dozens of city services -- including obtaining new business licenses, 
testing water meters and releasing impounded vehicles -- may be increased, 
according to a preliminary report by the city manager's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The council was undecided about how much, if at all, to subsidize selected 
youth recreation programs such as Tiny Tots and Day Camp. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to vote on the proposed increases later this month.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; CITY SAYS IT OPPOSES PROJECT FOR WETLANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has responded bluntly to an environmental impact report for the 
proposed Bolsa Chica housing development, saying in a letter from Seal Beach 
Mayor Gwen Forsythe that the document is flawed and that the project would have 
major negative effects on this little city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the county of Orange to know that we are opposed to this project," 
said Forsythe."We don't want it." 
</P>
<P>
 Other members of the council last week agreed with Forsythe's sentiments and 
authorized the mayor to write the strongly worded response to the county's EIR 
for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter specifically takes issue with the report's analysis of the 
increased traffic that would be generated if thousands of homes are built 
around the Bolsa Chica Wetlands, near the corner of Warner Avenue and Pacific 
Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The EIR states that the traffic might be mitigated if Pacific Coast Highway is 
widened through Sunset Beach and Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But state officials have no plans to widen the road, making it unlikely that 
any major traffic mitigations would be made, Forsythe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members also fear that the Koll Co. project would clog Seal Beach 
streets with cars, increase noise and pollution and possibly strain emergency 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Forsythe said the Bolsa Chica development and several other housing projects 
under development in Huntington Beach have the potential to increase the 
population of the area just south of Seal Beach by more than 20,000. SHELBY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; ROTARY CLUB ADOPTS PART OF ROAD TO CLEAN 
</P>

<P>
 The Rotary Club will begin cleaning up a stretch of Seal Beach Boulevard on a 
regular basis in what city officials hope will be the first of several 
"adopt-a-road" programs sponsored by groups in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rotary Club has taken responsibility for a roughly two-mile portion of the 
boulevard between Pacific Coast Highway and the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Rotary members and their families will periodically remove litter that 
collects along the roadway and on adjacent sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have hailed the effort, saying that it is an ideal way for 
local residents to help the cash-strapped city. 
</P>
<P>
 The road adoption could save the city as much as $2,000 a year, said Dennis 
Jue, Seal Beach's city engineer. Normally, it would take a two-man city crew 
one day to remove trash from Seal Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The job is usually performed twice a year, Jue said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were looking for an activity we could do that would make a contribution to 
the community," said Fred Middaugh, a Seal Beach attorney and Rotary Club 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 "This seemed like something that would benefit the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman William J. Doane said that Leisure World residents have long 
complained about the papers, cans and other garbage that collect along a 
perimeter gate on Seal Beach Boulevard after heavy rains or wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Doane said he hopes the road adoption will result in the gate being cleaned 
more often. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is looking for service groups and businesses to adopt other major 
roads in Seal Beach, including Lampson Avenue and Westminster Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's adjunct of the Seal Beach Lions Club adopted some of Pacific Coast 
Highway in an agreement with the California Department of Transportation, which 
maintains the road. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; TRAFFIC NOISE MAKING RESIDENTS UNHAPPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Becky Maffucci and her neighbor, Barbara Kays, say traffic noise and fumes 
have made their back yards useless. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since an extension of Harbor Boulevard in Los Angeles County was 
completed about two years ago, residents in the La Habra North Hills community, 
bordering La Habra Heights, have been complaining that the noise from cars and 
trucks has transformed their formerly tranquil neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Maffucci and Kays say their families cannot enjoy the grassy knoll behind 
their Rockinghorse Lane homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, they have demanded a lower speed limit, a marked crosswalk at 
Carmela Lane and stop signs to slow traffic. Those demands were rejected by a 
city study in 1992, but officials did step up police patrols in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents also called for three separate sound studies, which the city 
agreed to conduct. The studies concluded that although the noise levels may not 
be desirable, they are "acceptable and not unusual." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials agreed that traffic has increased because commuters turned to 
Harbor when it was extended; it allows them to bypass Fullerton Road in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that gets to us is that when we bought our homes, no one told us 
that this road was going to affect us," Maffucci said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before building the road, Los Angeles County concluded in an environmental 
impact report that La Habra residents would not be adversely affected by the 
added traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not have the right to deny the building of the road," Mayor David M. 
Cheverton said. "I wish I could say we could solve the problem, but I don't 
have the financial resources to do it, and if I had, I wouldn't know what to do 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Maffucci and her neighbors have suggested that the city replace trees facing 
Harbor behind their homes that were cut down recently. The trees used to serve 
as buffers, she said. To further reduce noise levels, residents have asked to 
be allowed to build eight-foot walls behind their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Lee Risner said the council will consider the recommendations at 
a meeting in March. However, he said, "the city does not have a financial or 
legal responsibility" to plant trees or build tall walls for the residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Maffucci said she is awakened every day at 4 a.m. by the sound of 
traffic zooming by and hates coming home in the afternoons because she feels 
trapped inside -- unable to open her windows because of the noise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come home with a knot in my stomach everyday," she said. "It's just no fun 
living here anymore. I'm very depressed." 
</P>
<P>
 To help cut the noise, she said, she spent about $1,000 installing 
double-paned windows. Kays said she spent nearly $10,000 installing 
double-paned windows and insulation but still hears the traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're so upset," Kays said. "We want assurances that anything that's possible 
is going to be done to slow traffic, increase safety and lower noise 
levels."MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAW GOES INTO EFFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With a raucous political year in the offing, a measure limiting to $250 the 
amount that can be contributed to a City Council race has become effective. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council adopted the measure in January, 14 months after the city's 
most expensive council race. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents said the new law will limit the influence of big spenders and the 
extent to which outsiders can control city elections. Opponents say it favors 
incumbents, three of whom are up for reelection in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The original version of the "Tin Cup" ordinance was crafted by the League of 
Women Voters of Orange Coast and Orange County Common Cause. It was revised by 
the council before it was endorsed by a 3-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Wayne L. Peterson voted against the measure. Councilman Robert F. 
Gentry, who had favored the measure in earlier discussions, was absent during 
the final vote. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Gentry said the new law creates "a level playing field" for 
political candidates and "diminishes the influence of special interests" while 
giving more power to individual voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a major step forward in taking the politics out of politics," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law does not limit spending or the amount of their own money 
candidates can pour into a race. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SKI-A-THON TO RAISE FUNDS FOR COALITION

<P>
 Skiers will hit the slopes of Mammoth Mountain on Saturday to raise money for 
a coalition against youth crime and a scholarship fund in memory of slain 
teen-ager Steve Woods. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Annual Steve Woods Ski-a-Thon will be held at Mammoth Mountain Ski 
Resort from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. A registration fee of $24 includes a T-shirt and 
barbecue.Prizes will be awarded to winners of the ski race. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, 17, died Nov. 9, about three weeks after his head was pierced by a 
metal paint roller rod during a confrontation with alleged gang members and 
their friends or associates at Calafia County Beach Park in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school senior loved to ski with family and friends and celebrated his 
birthday each February with a trip to Mammoth Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ski-a-Thon is sponsored in part by Athletes for Youth, a nonprofit group 
formed by broadcaster and former professional football player Todd Christensen 
to prevent youth crime and substance abuse. The organizers, including Woods' 
mother and sister, hope to make it into an annual event. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Liz Lee with Athletes for Youth: "All you need is your ski gear, your 
friends and lots of sponsors who pledge to support your efforts on the slopes." 
</P>
<P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; CITY MAY PASS RULES ON ADULT BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trying to prevent a "skid row," the City Council tonight will consider passing 
an emergency ordinance to control adult bookstores, topless bars and other 
adult-oriented businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been seeing problems created in other cities, and there's been 
applications (for adult businesses) in Newport Beach," Councilman Joe Erickson 
said. "We just feel that can lead to a skid-row type of effect, and we're not 
going to let that happen here." 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Manager Perry Valantine said his office has gotten recent inquiries 
about opening topless bars, adult video stores and sex-toy stores. He said the 
current adult entertainment ordinance does not give the city enough control. 
</P>
<P>
 Adult video stores are not mentioned in the ordinance, perhaps because they 
were not as common when the original law was passed in 1981, Valantine said. 
</P>
<P>
 The interim ordinance would be in effect only until the council passes a 
permanent one. City Atty. Thomas A. Kathe said he expects to deliver a finished 
ordinance March 14, but it will have to be reviewed and discussed during public 
hearings before the Planning Commission and the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the temporary ordinance, adult businesses would have to be at least 500 
feet from residences and 1,000 feet from other adult businesses, parks, schools 
and churches. Adult businesses would need to be licensed by the police chief 
after a background check. 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary ordinance would apply to businesses that use more than a quarter 
of their floor area to display adult-oriented items. 
</P>
<P>
 The council tonight will also consider whether to grant permits to two massage 
businesses that opened without receiving approval. At Planning Commission 
hearings, residents have argued that the businesses provide adult entertainment 
and should not be allowed to stay close to residences. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Robert J. Davis, who represents both Oriental Therapy East at 1525 
Mesa Verde Drive and Mesa Acupressure at 2845 Mesa Verde Drive, has said the 
businesses provide physical therapy for people suffering from injuries or 
stress. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Police Department opposes permits for the businesses, a fact Erickson 
said he will consider. "If I feel it's unhealthy for the community, I could not 
support their application," he said. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; CHOIR TO GET TO CARNEGIE HALL IN APRIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When members of Fountain Valley High School's Concert Choir perform in New 
York City's Carnegie Hall in April, it promises to be a high note of their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives our choir the opportunity to showcase our talent . . . to show 
everybody what we've got," said senior Heath Einstein, a choir member since his 
freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
 For classmate Mishel Popovich, singing at the famed concert hall is a dream 
come true. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my life's dreams is being fulfilled," said Popovich, who plans to 
study opera. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Reid, the school's vocal music director, agreed that the choir students' 
spring break trip will be a once-in-a-lifetime experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an opportunity for serious music students to say they've performed in 
Carnegie Hall," Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
 The students will perform with the Alabama Youth Chorale on April 10. The 
combined choirs -- 250 students strong -- will perform a program including 
choral classics, Renaissance songs and contemporary black gospel. Rodney 
Eichenberger, director of choral studies at Florida State University, will 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the five-day trip is costly -- $1,075 per student -- only 65 of the 83 
choir members will be traveling to New York City, Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve parent chaperons will also make the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Students have held fund-raisers and some have gotten jobs to help pay for the 
trip, which will include a Broadway show, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The popularity of the school's choral program has grown in recent years, said 
Reid, with 186 students enrolled. In addition, more people are attending school 
and community concerts; about 600 attended the Christmas performance last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people like what we do," he said, noting that a multicultural theme 
was presented for the fall concert. "Interesting programming is what draws 
people to your concerts." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who cannot make the New York City trip, the choir will present its 
Carnegie Hall program at 7:30 p.m. March 8 at Fountain Valley First Southern 
Baptist Church, 10351 Ellis Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission is $5 for adults and $3 for students and seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was threatened by districtwide budget cuts four years ago, but a 
grass-roots effort was mounted to save it and raise money to pay Reid's salary. 
</P>
<P>
 "To eliminate this program would create more controversy than what is healthy 
for the district," Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reid said the benefits for students go far beyond the joy of belting out a 
song. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think music speaks to a part of our humanity that language can't address," 
he said. "After a kid has been involved in a good performance, they leave with 
a peak experience . . . a self-actualization." 
</P>
<P>
 Students also learn discipline, responsibility and teamwork, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives them a great social outlet -- and it's a wholesome activity," he 
said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; RESIDENTS' GROUP TO ENDORSE INCUMBENTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A group active in local politics will support council members Leslie Anne 
Pontious and Charles E. Puckett in their bids for second terms on the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Kasalek, president of TRAC, or Tustin Residents Action Committee, said 
that his group decided to support Pontious and Puckett after interviewing the 
four candidates in the April 12 municipal election. 
</P>
<P>
 Businessman Michael Doyle and Tracy Worley, a member of the city's Parks and 
Recreation Commission, are challenging Pontious and Puckett for their seats on 
the five-member council. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tustin is financially sound, and we feel Leslie and Chuck have been part of 
this success," Kasalek said. "Any major changes may negatively affect this 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
 TRAC is composed of 15 residents who head local homeowners associations or are 
active in community organizations, Kasalek said. 
</P>
<P>
 In supporting these two candidates, they do not represent their respective 
homeowners associations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 TRAC, which was formed in 1988, also supported Pontious and Puckett when they 
ran for the council in 1990, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the police and city employees unions endorsed Doyle and 
Worley, who also have gotten the support of Mayor Jim Potts. 
</P>
<P>
 Several candidates' forums have been scheduled to give the voters a chance to 
assess the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tustin Meadows Community Assn. will hold a forum at 7:30 p.m. March 16 at 
the west clubhouse on 14702 Devonshire Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Another forum sponsored by the Tustin Chamber of Commerce will be held at 7 
p.m. March 30 in council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Assn. of University Women will also hold a forum at 7 p.m. April 
5 in council chambers. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; 2 ABSENCES POSTPONE SEWAGE FEE DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council postponed a decision last week on whether to raise sanitation 
and sewer fees because two council members were absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Gene Beyer requested that the council delay the item, which would tack 
on $1.87 to the $12 monthly fee the average single-family residence now pays 
for the sanitation services. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed increase would fund the city's material recovery, tree trimming 
and weed abatement programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor said he was recuperating at home after undergoing a recent 
"defibrillator exchange." The device, which restarts the heart by electrical 
current, was implanted about two years ago after the mayor experienced severe 
heart complications. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mike Spurgeon also did not attend last week's council meeting 
because of a "business commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's absence upset members of a local taxpayers organization that had 
distributed more than 300 flyers calling on members to protest the proposed 
hike at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyer did not notify the city clerk that he would not attend the council 
meeting until that morning, according to the city clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not fair to the community to wait until the last minute to change the 
meeting," said Carole Walters of the Orange Taxpayers Assn. "If someone can't 
be here, that's not our problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyer has missed two council meetings a month in December, January and 
February, according to city reports. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Beyer, who was working at home last week, said he will be back for 
the council's meeting tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed fee increase is scheduled to be considered at the 7 p.m. 
session.MARTIN MILLER

NEW FOOTHILL TOLL LANES AIM FOR QUICKER COLLECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move to speed motorists along on their way, two new toll collection lanes 
for the Foothill tollway will open this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The improvement comes four months after the opening of the 3.2-mile tollway 
and will help more than 8,000 commuters travel "more efficiently," officials 
from the Transportation Corridor Agencies announced last week. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional northbound lane will open at the Portola Parkway off-ramp at 2 
p.m. today, and an additional southbound lane will open at 2 p.m. Wednesday. 
Each new lane will be equipped with coin-toss toll machines, which require 
exact change of 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The northbound ramp will now have one electronic toll collection lane and two 
coin-toss machine lanes. The southbound ramp will have one electronic toll 
collection lane, one coin-toss machine lane and one manual lane where change 
can be made by a toll attendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Toll collectors have been stationed at the coin-toss machine at Portola 
Parkway during the morning commute to make change. That service will be 
eliminated with the opening of the new lanes, officials said.

ALISO VIEJO PARENTS ASSAIL RACE-BIAS INVESTIGATION; INQUIRY: GROUP SAYS MIDDLE 
SCHOOL PROBE FAILED TO LOOK INTO THE 'REAL PROBLEMS,' SUCH AS 'HOSTILE 
ENVIRONMENT,' 'BULLYING TECHNIQUES' OF EDUCATORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An investigation into complaints of racial discrimination at Aliso Viejo 
Middle School failed to look seriously at the school's "hostile environment" 
and the "bullying techniques" used by administrators, a group of parents 
alleged Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issues addressed by the investigation do not begin to scratch the surface 
of the real problems on the AVMS campus," said parent Leslie Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' statement was included in a letter she made public Monday in 
announcing that a group of parents of African American, Asian and Latino 
students would be submitting 10 to 20 letters of protest to school board 
President Paul Haseman today. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-month investigation, officials of the Capistrano Unified School 
District released a report last week that said 21 charges of racism and 
discrimination toward the school's minority students could not be 
substantiated. The charges had been lodged by minority parents at a December 
meeting of trustees and in news reports. 
</P>
<P>
 District Supt. James A. Fleming, however, conceded in the report that 
miscommunication and insensitivity led to the perception of racial bias. The 
school's problems were exacerbated, Fleming said, by the fact that the school 
opened only last fall and 800 students and 35 teachers were just getting to 
know each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming said mediators and counselors would be brought in to settle tensions 
among some of the school's staff, students and parents. He also announced that 
the school had initiated a number of programs to educate students on cultural 
diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harris, mother of a seventh-grader, complained Monday that a panel of 
district administrators who investigated the charges did not look into other 
complaints from parents that were not tied to race. Harris said the school's 
principal, Cheryl Lampe, and other staff members have been too tough in 
controlling students and trying to keep the campus safe from gangs and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their actions have created a hostile environment for the children that is 
counterproductive to the supposed goal of education," Harris states in the 
letter to Haseman. "The investigation team did not address this issue other 
than to praise the bullying techniques used by the school administrators." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Haseman had not yet received the letters, he said Monday he expected 
to meet with the parents behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will certainly want to respond after seeing the letters," Haseman said. 
"We want to do the right thing. If they have some misgivings, we want to talk 
with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Haseman acknowledged that the school district has installed a strict dress 
code and anti-gang policy that has been carried out at Aliso Viejo. He also 
said he has received "a lot of favorable response to the Aliso Viejo faculty." 
</P>
<P>
 Another letter to be delivered to Haseman is from Jenny Bayless, whose African 
American grandson is an Aliso Viejo seventh-grader. Bayless criticized the 
district for not using an outside group to conduct the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel the administrators at Aliso Viejo Middle School and Capistrano Unified 
School District are unable to see or deal with the real problems because of 
their haste to protect their image," Bayless said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Bayless and Harris contended district investigators contacted only nine 
minority parents, contrary to Supt. Fleming's report that most of the school's 
100 minority parents were consulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, who was not among the parents contacted, is white. She is married to a 
Panamanian and their daughter is considered black, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 They also objected to the district's method of informing parents about the 
report. Only a few parents were able to attend an information session before 
Fleming released it to the news media.  
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest complaint that parents have is that there is no parental contact 
before action is taken," Harris said. "This is a community of parents who care 
and need to be apprised of what's going on."

RELEASE RATE OF CFCS IS SLOWING, RESEARCHERS SAY; ENVIRONMENT: INTERNATIONAL 
PACT TO PHASE OUT OZONE-DEPLETING CHEMICAL 'IS TAKING EFFECT,' UCI PROFESSOR 
SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The increase in concentration of chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere has 
been reduced by half since industrial nations agreed to phase out manufacture 
of the ozone-depleting chemical, researchers said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "An international agreement is taking effect. The countries of the world are 
actually following it," said F. Sherwood Rowland of UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that good news, experts said chlorofluorocarbons already released into 
the atmosphere will continue to savage ozone, the natural chemical that 
protects Earth from the sun's harmful radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 At a symposium at the national meeting of the American Assn. for the 
Advancement of Science, researchers reported that the chlorofluorocarbons, or 
CFCs, increased at the rate of 4% annually through the 1980s, but the rate has 
now slowed to about 2%. 
</P>
<P>
 CFCs are used in refrigeration and industrial processes. They once were used 
as a propellant in aerosol cans. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers discovered in the 1970s that the chemical broke down into chlorine 
in the atmosphere and that the chlorine was depleting the ozone layer. Without 
ozone, the Earth has no protection from ultraviolet solar rays, a form of 
radiation that can cause skin cancer and damage genetic material. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, industrial nations signed an agreement to phase out CFCs. That 
agreement has since been updated twice, with the latest calling for a ban on 
most CFCs by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rowland said some CFC molecules already in the atmosphere will take up to 
a century to decay. 
</P>
<P>
 Another researcher, C.R. Booth of Biospherical Instruments, a contractor for 
the National Science Foundation, said a network of instruments around the world 
have proven a direct link between the loss of ozone and a sharp increase in 
ultraviolet radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Booth said instruments in Antarctica, Alaska, South America and San Diego have 
all detected increases in ultraviolet radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a strong and very predictable correlation in rises in ultraviolet 
light and decreases in ozone," Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
 The instruments, which measure ultraviolet radiation spectra that are damaging 
to skin and to DNA, detected record levels of ultraviolet in the Antarctic. 
</P>
<P>
 At Palmer Station, a U.S. facility in Antarctica, instruments recorded in a 
few weeks more harmful ultraviolet radiation than is seen in an entire year in 
San Diego, Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the result of a so-called "ozone hole" that has been detected over the 
South Polar region every spring for a number of years. Recent measurements have 
detected an ozone depletion over the South Pole of up to 70% during some days. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond C. Smith, a UC Santa Barbara researcher, is studying the biological 
effects of the decreased ozone near the South Pole. He said that beneath the 
ozone hole there is a 6% to 12% decline in the population of phytoplankton, a 
microscopic algae that is the foundation of the food chain in the far southern 
seas.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; REQUESTS FOR FEMA AID SET RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 It felt like the worst natural disaster in local memory, and Monday the 
government provided more data to prove it -- announcing that a national record 
of 365,118 people have applied for Federal Emergency Management Agency 
assistance in the wake of the Northridge earthquake, more than the previous 
high of 304,000 after Hurricane Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every new application is setting a record," said FEMA spokesman Bret Hansard, 
adding that the agency has granted $209.4 million in disaster housing aid to 
72,113 people who suffered damage as a result of the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Small Business Administration has registered more loan applications than 
in any disaster, said spokesman Rick Jenkins. Through last week, the SBA had 
issued 302,625 applications to homeowners, renters and business owners, he 
said. More than 53,000 had returned those applications, he said, and the SBA 
has approved $108.7 million in low-interest, long-term loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "This disaster is huge in scope. There have been so many people affected," 
Jenkins said. "In the first two weeks, we had issued more loan applications 
than we did during the first six months of Hurricane Andrew. And we're still 
issuing thousands every day." 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline for individuals applying for aid from the agency is March 18 -- 
60 days after President Clinton declared Los Angeles, Ventura and Orange 
counties a federal disaster area.  
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge quake killed at least 57 people, collapsed freeways and damaged 
or destroyed more than 45,000 homes. State officials have estimated the cost at 
$13 billion to $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA's emergency housing grants are awarded in two-month increments to renters 
and three-month increments to homeowners -- typically $1,100 per month for 
quake victims, given without regard to income. Hansard said inspectors are 
working around the clock to confirm that applicants have incurred the damage 
they claim. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA is also offering grants of up to $10,000 to homeowners whose residences 
need minimal repairs to make them "safe, sanitary and secure." To get aid, 
Hansard said, "you don't necessarily have to be someone whose home was 
completely destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA officials have opened two long-term earthquake service centers -- at 
28460 Avenue Stanford in Valencia and 1901 S. Bundy Drive on the Westside -- as 
the first of 10 such centers designed to replace the 21 short-term disaster 
assistance centers FEMA set up after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Individuals seeking information about quake aid from FEMA can call (800) 
525-0321.

 Call them personal communicators or call them digital assistants. The little 
gadgets have a penchant for promising social revolution and ending up as 
expensive toys. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember Sharp's pocket organizer, the Wizard? How about the Bookman, Sony's 
portable CD player for reading books, and the Fujitsu Poquet, a pocketbook-size 
computer? Unless you're a gadget-freak, you probably don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, EO's personal communicator and Apple's Newton Messagepad were added 
to the electronic clutter. Both products have sold in small numbers relative to 
the huge publicity that preceded them. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, don't be too quick to dismiss these widgets. A new generation of 
products with built-in communications capabilities is on its way with the March 
7 unveiling of a machine from Motorola based on a new operating system. 
</P>
<P>
 These new products will find homes with a small but growing band of mobile 
executives whose long hours on the road or time-sensitive business dealings 
make it important to receive and respond to faxes and electronic mail quickly 
no matter where they are or what they are doing. 
</P>
<P>
 As the infrastructure for wireless communications improves and as new software 
applications become available, you may yet wake up one day to discover that a 
single gadget can act as your date book, pager, note pad, calculator and 
cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Link Resources, a New York-based research company, predicts sales of portable 
communications devices will begin to take off next year as better products are 
introduced, reaching 5 million annual units in 1998, up from the 779,000 
devices sold last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese consumer electronics companies, which have gone through a long barren 
period without any hit products, are excited by the market's potential. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickey Shulhoff, president of Sony Corp. of America, said he wouldn't be 
surprised if, by 2005, these devices are found in 40% of U.S. households. Sony 
has created a new division dedicated to design, manufacture and sell the 
personal communicators it plans to unveil in the fall, giving the product 
category the same weight, organizationally at least, as the company's 
$4-billion consumer electronics division. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, personal digital assistants have flopped grandly enough to be the 
subject of derision in the Doonesbury comic strip. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first product is never the realization of the dreams of its inventors," 
says Marc Porat, chief executive of General Magic, a start-up backed by, among 
others, Sony, Matsushita, Motorola and AT&T. General Magic has developed 
software on which a new generation of products will be based. "It was true for 
radio and television, and it will continue to be true for personal 
communicators," Porat said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly a lot has to happen before this market takes off. Take price. 
Motorola's new device is expected to sell for slightly less than $1,000. It 
will include a built-in wireless modem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wants to spend $1,000 for a smart telephone or an organizer," said 
Bruce Lupatkin, an analyst at Hambrecht & Quist, a San Francisco investment 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the communications software. A truly useful device would 
automatically make the necessary connections to tap corporate databases, 
collect e-mail or send voice messages, said Mark Eppley, president of 
Travelling Software, whose software is embedded in many of the devices. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to this the cost of subscribing to a wireless communications service so 
you can send and receive data. Today it costs $75 a month to subscribe to a 
service such as Ram Mobile Data. 
</P>
<P>
 Last and very far from least, there is the lack of software available for the 
machines to make them perform useful functions. 
</P>
<P>
 But these obstacles could fall quickly. McCaw Cellular predicts that by the 
end of the year, you will be able to subscribe to a wireless service that will 
enable you to pick up e-mail or get stock quotes sent to your personal 
communicator for as little as $20 a month. Forrester Research predicts that the 
devices themselves could fall to $200, one-fifth of this year's price, by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the new-generation devices that don't come with built-in 
communications will have standardized slots into which credit-card-size 
wireless modems or pagers can be plugged in. 
</P>
<P>
 As for applications, the move toward software standards is making it 
increasingly attractive for software houses to develop programs for these 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Newton software, which Apple recently agreed to license to 
other manufacturers, two other companies are aggressively pushing into this 
market and are expected to eclipse the Newton as industry standards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The more approachable system comes from General Magic. It offers a friendly 
interface and the ability to use "intelligent agents," little packets of codes 
that, with simple instructions, will go searching through computer networks for 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 Porat says he has long wanted to see Madonna but could never remember to get 
tickets on time. Once the various services are in place, Magic Cap will enable 
the user to send an intelligent agent into the system with orders to buy 
tickets the next time Madonna comes to town -- and to make sure the time 
doesn't conflict with his schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The first devices from Sony and Motorola will run on General Magic's Magic Cap 
software. 
</P>
<P>
 The other major challenger in the field is Microsoft. Playing on its strength 
in personal computers, Microsoft is promoting the personal communicator market 
as a "companion" to the personal computer, aimed primarily at business 
executives who want wireless access to their computers whether they are out of 
town on business or wandering the hallways outside their offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The move toward a few key software standards has encouraged software houses to 
write for the devices. In spite of the bad publicity that has accompanied poor 
sales of the Newton and the EO, software houses are rushing into the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple says it has already sold more than 2,800 kits to help developers create 
software for the Newton. Albert Chu, director of product planning and strategy 
at Apple's personal interactive electronics division, says there are now 27 
packages available on the system, and there will be 100 applications available 
by the end of summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more interesting applications: a package that turns the Newton into 
a mini-teleprompter, allowing the user to scroll through a speech at a 
comfortable speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Software available for Magic Cap devices include an interpreter for travelers, 
Intuit's popular Quicken personal finance program, an Official Airline Guides 
package for checking fares and seat availability and a spreadsheet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been through several generations of these machines," said Faruq 
Ahmad, vice president at PenWare Inc., the spreadsheet company. He has used the 
Motorola device soon to be unveiled and is suitably impressed. Now that the 
machines have built-in communications capabilities enabling users to pull 
information out of their office computers, "this market will start to take 
off," Ahmad said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft is a latecomer to the market; products using its software are not 
due out until year-end. But it has already held conferences and created tools 
to help companies build portable extensions to their Windows software packages. 
</P>
<P>
 "The important thing is to get access to the information running on your 
desktop," said Bruce Baker, Microsoft's general manager of hand-held systems. 
He envisions people using the portable devices to browse through and pick out 
files or read mail while they are on the road or walking around their offices. 
</P>
<P>
 While General Magic's "intuitive" approach may make it a stronger contender in 
the long run for the non-technical user, Baker argues that it will be a long 
time before the market extends beyond business. 
</P>
<P>
 Both companies agree that the key function that will drive these 
new-generation devices is e-mail. Not long ago, e-mail use was restricted to 
technical people, or those working in large corporations with in-house systems. 
Now hundreds of thousands of new users each month are tapping into on-line 
systems to send electronic messages. 
</P>
<P>
 "With these devices, it will be like sending electronic Post-its," Porat said. 
</P>
<P>
 A major technical problem has always been how to get data into the devices 
without a keyboard. The Newton and EO were supposed to solve the problem using 
a technology called handwriting recognition. The user scribbles letters 
directly onto a screen for the computer to translate into letters or numbers 
that can then be manipulated by computer. The technology has proved cumbersome 
and slow. 
</P>
<P>
 General Magic tries to avoid the problem by offering visual cues and a touch 
screen. When data entry is absolutely necessary, you touch letters on a 
projection of a keyboard on the small screen. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T's EO is minimizing that problem by targeting its next product as a 
simple-to-use "smart cellular phone" with such additional features as e-mail 
and faxing, rather than a computing device with varied uses. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple's Chu said the primary market for these devices over the next year will 
be in applications custom-developed for specific companies. He said there are 
already 100 major corporations developing software to use the Newton in-house. 
</P>
<P>
 As more software, including games, becomes available for the devices, Chu 
said, the market will broaden. Meanwhile, the products could continue to face 
tough times. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to General Magic and Microsoft's criticism of the Newton's 
performance, Chu said: "They haven't even shipped product yet. When they get to 
the market, they will find a different reality."

 White remains the most popular car color in North America, but green is fast 
gaining ground. White was the color of 20% of the vehicles purchased last year, 
down 4% from 1992, according to the annual survey by auto paint maker DuPont 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Green, meanwhile, doubled in popularity to more than 15% of the market. Medium 
red was in third place with 10.5% of the market; bright red claimed 8.8% and 
black 7.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who select green are socially well-adjusted, civilized and suburban. 
White, on the other hand, is innocence, purity, honesty and cleanliness," said 
Roseann Forde, fashion director of women's apparel for DuPont Fibers. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking ahead, DuPont predicts more purple and gold vehicles and rising 
consumer interest in bicolor effects, in which the hue changes when viewed at 
different angles.

FROM RAG TO DISHES FOR THE EDITOR OF TABLOID SUN; COMMUNICATIONS: MURDOCH STUNS 
BRITAIN BY SELECTING FLAMBOYANT KELVIN MACKENZIE TO RUN SATELLITE TV SERVICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KAYE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rupert Murdoch, a man always full of surprises, has stunned British media 
circles with the appointment of Fleet Street's wildest -- and perhaps most 
successful -- editor to run the BSkyB satellite television service. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking over the $2-billion multichannel operation without benefit of any 
previous TV experience is Kelvin MacKenzie, 47-year-old editor of Murdoch's 
tabloid, the Sun -- the biggest daily in Britain with a circulation averaging 
3.7 million and home of the Page 3 Girl. 
</P>
<P>
 MacKenzie's antics have made him as well-known as nearly anyone his paper 
covers. He once installed a Hate-Line for complaining readers to yell at his 
deputy editor and warned politicians, "If you don't want to appear in the 
papers, then don't drop your trousers." 
</P>
<P>
 The editor's "splash" headlines are legendary: "From Toe Job to No Job" 
concerned the resignation of a government minister caught in a kinky sex 
scandal. He once fired the paper's astrologer with a letter that began, "As you 
will already know. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 And after the British general election in 1992, for which the Sun used its 
news pages to campaign ferociously and successfully for John Major's 
Conservative government, the paper boasted across the front page: "It's the Sun 
Wot Won It!" 
</P>
<P>
 It is MacKenzie's ability to make the Sun a part of the news, not just a 
messenger, that is thought to be one of the primary reasons for his ascension 
to managing director of BSkyB. 
</P>
<P>
 "BSkyB wants to accelerate the process of getting new subscribers," says Terry 
Povey, an analyst with Bell Securities in London. "For that, they need a big 
mouth who can grab a few headlines." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Quentin Smith, deputy editor of the British trade magazine Broadcasting, 
"What they really need now is someone who can get people talking, someone with 
a sense of what will appeal to the masses -- sort of pull off a Sun with 
BSkyB." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone speaks glowingly of MacKenzie, though. Michael Grade, chief 
executive of Britain's Channel 4 television and an outspoken critic of BSkyB's 
programming standards, told reporters, "Kelvin is the only person I know who 
could take the channel down-market." 
</P>
<P>
 MacKenzie, who declined to be interviewed, arrives at the satellite service at 
a turning point in its development. The six-channel service, half-owned by 
Murdoch's News International but effectively run by Murdoch, only recently 
began earning a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, in a move to galvanize interest in satellite TV and generate 
additional revenue, BSkyB organized a basic package of 14 channels -- its own 
and others -- that was offered for a monthly rate of $10.50. The move proved 
successful. The company reported selling a record 1.3 million satellite dishes 
in December, boosting the number of homes it reaches to 3.1 million. Satellite 
programming still accounts for just 6% of viewing, however. 
</P>
<P>
 BSkyB will not say how many viewers it lost because of the changeover, which 
required dish owners to suddenly pay for some channels they had been receiving 
for free. Broadcasting magazine put the number of lost homes at 200,000, a 
figure that deputy editor Smith termed "not bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the channel repackaging at BSkyB has gone a management shake-up 
that sent Murdoch's two top managers to look after other parts of the empire. 
Sam Chisholm, chief executive at BSkyB, remains in charge of the service but 
now also has responsibility for running all Murdoch's TV operations outside 
North America. Former managing director Gary Davey is now running Star TV in 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 With a solid framework established for BSkyB, the theory goes, it is 
MacKenzie's job to speed up growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kelvin is one of the most talented media executives" in Britain, a BSkyB 
spokesman says, explaining his appointment. "He understands what makes 
something work." 
</P>
<P>
 But MacKenzie's 13 years as editor of the Sun may prove troublesome in at 
least one area. His arrival at BSkyB coincides with efforts by Europe's 
independent television producers to force the British government to enforce 
European Union (formerly known as the European Community) quotas on imported 
programming and independent production on satellite services. 
</P>
<P>
 BSkyB offers three movie channels showing mostly American films, and a general 
entertainment channel, Sky One, which relies heavily on U.S. and Australian 
imports. "The Simpsons" and "Beverly Hills, 90210," both from Murdoch's U.S. 
entertainment companies, are among its most popular programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The satellite service also offers a news channel and a sports channel, both of 
which use locally produced programming. Neither of those categories is taken 
into consideration under EU quota guidelines, however. Those call for 51% of 
all TV programming to be European in origin and at least 10% of all programming 
to come from independent producers "where practicable," a term that has so far 
allowed room for maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
 With the issue heating up, it will almost certainly fall on MacKenzie to 
smooth things over. But cozying up to Continentals has never been MacKenzie's 
thing. Quite the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 Under his leadership, the Sun became a bastion of xenophobia. French attempts 
to block imports of British lamb brought the headline "Hop Off, You Frogs." And 
anger with Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, resulted in 
the now-legendary headline "Up Yours Delors." 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's up to MacKenzie to explain to the Eurocrats why BSkyB deserves 
special dispensation.

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: PRIMED FOR AN EARFUL; AS COST OF TV INFOMERCIALS 
SOARS, SPONSORS TURN TO RADIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oddball products ranging from spray-on hair to Ginsu knives have sold like 
hotcakes in the often murky but wildly successful world of TV infomercials. Now 
the marketers that brought infomercials to TV are dialing up a new medium: 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
 An onslaught of radio infomercials -- slick, 30-minute ads that often sound 
more like talk shows or game shows -- may soon bring products like the 
Thighmaster exercise kit to your AM dial. Spiraling TV costs have turned off a 
number of infomercial advertisers, while many radio stations are hungry to fill 
up dead air time and cash in on the $1-billion infomercial industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike television, where infomercials are almost always 30 minutes long, radio 
infomercials will come in all sizes. Some stations are already airing half-hour 
infomercials for free, cashing in on commissions from product sales. Others are 
testing one-minute, direct-response ads by TV advertisers who are using radio 
to reach new listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 Because radio infomercials are so new, it's too soon to tell what impact they 
will have. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a still mostly unexplored area," said Joel Winston, assistant 
director at the Federal Trade Commission's division of ad practices, which 
monitors infomercials for deception. 
</P>
<P>
 While only a few infomercial marketers have begun testing radio, some of the 
industry giants say they will probably begin doing so later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Most say the crossover to radio is difficult. Consumers listening to 
infomercials while whizzing along the freeway aren't likely to pull over to 
order products. And the magic of TV -- which shows consumers every detail of 
how the products work -- is missing from radio. 
</P>
<P>
 To be successful, radio infomercials must be even more entertaining than those 
on television, said Jeff Knowles, co-founder and general counsel of the 
National Infomercial Marketing Assn. "Just providing a toll-free number that 
people can remember long enough to get to a telephone is tough enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor do radio listeners think in half-hour blocks, said Gary Fries, president 
of the Radio Advertising Bureau. "You might get them to sit for 20 seconds 
until the end of the advertisement, but probably not 20 minutes until the end 
of the infomercial," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, "few infomercial advertisers have a clue how to advertise on the 
radio," said Steve Butler, president of Inside Radio Inc., an industry 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many are scrambling to figure that out. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them is one of the kings of infomercials: Ron Popeil, founder of Beverly 
Hills-based Ronco Inc. Perhaps best known for products his company has sold for 
years on television, such as GLH Formula Spray-on Hair and a $60 food 
dehydrator, Popeil says the skyrocketing cost of TV ad time has left him no 
alternative but to turn to radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can't make money on TV, you have to look to radio," Popeil said. "It's 
the only place to go to stay in the infomercial business." 
</P>
<P>
 Case in point: Less than a year ago, cable channel CNBC charged Popeil $9,600 
for 30 minutes of commercial time at 4 p.m. Sundays. A few months ago, it asked 
Popeil for $20,500 for the same slot, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that rate, I'd lose $5,000 to $10,000 every time I ran the ad," Popeil 
said. He plans to begin airing radio infomercials this year. "I should have 
begun doing them months ago," he lamented. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Powter, whose Stop the Insanity weight loss program has been a TV 
infomercial smash, is expected to star soon in her first radio infomercial. 
"She's so strong from a vocal standpoint, we believe her voice would be very 
compelling on the radio," said Jeff Engler, president of USA Direct, the 
company behind Powter's flashy TV campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Several companies have sprung up recently to act as go-betweens linking the 
big wheels of TV infomercials with the radio stations that want their dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Radio has missed the billion-dollar infomercial bandwagon," said Peter Hartz, 
senior vice president at IDB Communications Group, a Culver City company that 
recently established an InfoRadio Network division to match infomercial makers 
with radio stations. "Now radio is suddenly being seen as the new frontier." 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of paying for radio time, Hartz swings deals with stations to run 
the ads on commission. For example, in exchange for airing the 30-minute 
infomercial "Winning for Life," which features a series of motivational tapes 
and a video, InfoRadio pays the radio stations $10.13 for each $59.95 order it 
receives. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a much harder deal to swing with television stations, which typically 
demand broadcast money up front from most infomercial makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, several radio stations are already testing infomercials. KABC 
recently began airing two 30-minute infomercials at midnight Saturdays. "This 
is a time period when we would normally broadcast reruns of talk shows," 
general manager George Green said. "We asked ourselves, is it illegal? No. Is 
it immoral? No. Is it deceptive? Well, we certainly hope not." All infomercials 
are identified as advertisements, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at radio station KIEV use a different term for the infomercials 
they air. "We call it block programming," said Fred Beaton, co-owner of the 
Glendale station, which airs paid programming from advertisers ranging from 
dentists to financial advisers. "I don't think it's confusing," Beaton said. 
"It's a service we make available to our listeners." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Radio Direct Response, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa.-based firm, recently 
began turning several very familiar, half-hour TV infomercials into 60-second 
radio spots that its president, Mark Lipsky, calls "radio-mercials." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the bridge between the TV infomercial industry and the radio 
industry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While 30-minute TV infomercials for Thighmaster Plus feature sexy spokeswoman 
Suzanne Somers, the one-minute radio spot Lipsky's firm helped create for the 
same product features a fast-talking, stand-up female comedian, who the firm 
hopes can better capture the ear of radio listeners.  
</P>
<P>
 The spot just began airing, so it's too early to judge results, Lipsky said. 
But he has few doubts that his radio infomercials will be successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way we look at it is simple," Lipsky said. "TV baits the hook and radio 
reels them in." Rising Infomercial Sales The radio industry, with lots of 
unsold air time, is trying to coax the big infomercial makers to switch some of 
their broadcast ad spending away from TV to radio. Here is a look at how 
product sales generated by TV infomercial programs have stacked up over the 
years, in millions of dollars.

 Fluor Chief Has Prostate Cancer: The Irvine-based engineering concern said Les 
McCraw, its chairman and chief executive, will undergo surgery March 2.Fluor 
spokeswoman Kirsten Frosh said the tumor is small and contained and that "it 
was caught in the very early stages of development." McCraw, 59, is expected to 
return to work two weeks after the surgery. He was named CEO of Fluor in 1990 
and assumed the additional title of chairman the following year. He has worked 
for the engineering giant since 1975. After suffering a string of losses in the 
early and mid-1980s, Fluor posted record revenue of $7.9 billion for 1993, with 
earnings of $166.8 million.

 Honda to Sell Its Share of Rover: The Japanese auto maker was spurned last 
month in its attempt to raise its stake in Rover Group to nearly 50%, and Honda 
now says it will give up its current 20% holding in the British company. The 
likely buyer is BMW, which last month agreed to buy 80% of Rover from British 
Aerospace.Honda's announcement came after officials of the three auto makers 
met in Tokyo. Honda, which had licensed technology to Rover and made engines 
for its vehicles, said it will also review its existing business projects with 
Rover. The two companies began working together in 1979, when Honda gave Rover 
license to produce its Ballade passenger car for the European market.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: MISTAKES IN RETIREE PENSION BENEFITS ARE 
COMMONPLACE 
</P>

 When Gerry got his pension distribution, he knew something was wrong. The New 
Jersey resident was supposed to get $38,375 for his accumulated benefits from 
four years of textile sales at a manufacturing company. Instead he got only 
$19,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A year and nearly $4,000 in legal fees later, Gerry finally got the full 
amount -- but he isn't very happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should I have to spend $3,970.40 on an attorney to get the money I was 
always entitled to?" fumes Gerry, who asked that his full name not be used. "I 
don't know if this was an honest error or if it was intentional. But it's 
ridiculous what I had to go through just to get what I was due." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry's story is indicative of an insidious national problem, pension experts 
say. There are no national statistics, but pension actuaries and attorneys 
estimate that as many as a quarter of the nation's retirees are not getting the 
pension benefits they're entitled to, partly because of confusing and 
ever-changing federal pension laws. Also, the value of certain types of pension 
funds can be calculated in several different ways -- and some tend to 
understate how much workers have saved. 
</P>
<P>
 Some workers lose tens of thousands of dollars as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pension world has become immensely complicated," says G. Patrick Byrnes, 
president of Actuarial Consultants Inc. in Torrance and past president of the 
American Society of Pension Actuaries. "Errors have become fairly common." 
</P>
<P>
 Byrnes estimates that 15% to 25% of the defined contribution plans, such as 
401(k)s and profit-sharing accounts, have errors. Somewhere between 5% and 15% 
of the defined benefit plans -- in which the employer promises a set benefit at 
retirement based on years of service and salary -- are incorrect, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Other pension experts estimate the error rate is somewhat higher. But, since 
there are no statistics, no one knows for sure. The one thing that most of the 
experts agree on is that mistakes are commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how many errors there are, but I am confident that there are a 
lot," says Chester Salkind, executive director of the American Society of 
Pension Actuaries in Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 While some of the mistakes are small -- simple typographical errors that add 
or reduce the pension benefit by just a few dollars -- others can cost retirees 
tens of thousands of dollars, says Paul Holzman, co-founder of the National 
Center for Retirement Benefits in Northbrook, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Holzman says his firm is working with one retiree who discovered his lump-sum 
pension payment was $94,000 short. Another man's company simply "lost" any 
record of his 20 years of employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Holzman says there are more than two dozen common pension errors, more than 
half of which can leave retirees with reduced payments. These include failing 
to include bonuses, overtime and commissions when computing benefits based on 
annual earnings; forgetting early years of service; miscalculating the value of 
plan assets, and using the wrong formula to calculate pension benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Few companies cut workers' payouts on purpose, experts note. Most errors are 
caused by Byzantine and continually changing federal pension laws, says Byrnes. 
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the nation's pension rule book, 
has undergone five major revisions in the last eight years, Byrnes notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse still, the law is so intricate and interconnected that each change spurs 
dozens of official "interpretations" by the Internal Revenue Service and the 
Labor Department. The 1986 tax act, for example, resulted in more than 1,000 
pages of pension rules -- interpretations of the law -- that trickled out over 
four years, Byrnes says. In 1990, the law was changed again. It was changed 
twice in 1992, then changed again in President Clinton's Omnibus Reconciliation 
Act of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Pension administrators, particularly of smaller plans, simply don't have the 
time or expertise to keep up, Byrnes says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason there are numerous errors is not because of evil; it's because of 
the complexity of the calculation," Salkind agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 For retirees, that's troubling mainly because the law's complexity makes it 
virtually impossible for laymen to find errors if they wait until retirement to 
look. Instead, those who suspect problems late in the game almost always have 
to hire professionals to ferret them out. And that can be expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Pension actuaries commonly charge more than $200 to do a basic review of a 
defined benefit plan and between $500 and $1,000 -- depending on the complexity 
-- to examine a defined contribution plan, Byrnes says. If you need to get a 
pension attorney involved, the costs can easily add up to several thousand 
dollars, says Stephen J. Krass, senior partner at the New York law firm of 
Krass & Lund and author of "The Pension Answer Book." 
</P>
<P>
 Holzman's company doesn't charge anything up front, but if the firm discovers 
that you've been shortchanged, they'll take half the amount of the error. In 
other words, if they discover errors that land you an extra $50,000 in pension 
benefits, you pay them $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Actuaries are lobbying to pass a law that would require defined contribution 
plans to be intermittently reviewed by independent professionals. But even the 
law's greatest advocates have little hope of anything happening soon because 
the congressional docket is swamped with weighty and complex issues, such as 
health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they say, consumers must help themselves by monitoring their pension 
plans carefully and contemporaneously -- just as they would watch their 
investments or savings accounts. It's much easier to correct an error that's 
just happened than to find and fix one that's festered for 30 or 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should review your 401(k) statements just like you balance your checking 
account," says Cindy Hounsell, director of the women's pension project at the 
Pension Rights Center in Washington.

MONITOR PLAN TO AVOID ERRORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's difficult, if not impossible, to find an error in your pension plan, 
especially after 40 years' worth of calculations. Many experts therefore advise 
that you monitor the plan as you go. 
</P>
<P>
 How can you do that? The answer depends on what type of plan you're in. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two basic types: Defined benefit plans, which promise to pay a set 
amount at retirement based on your years of service and your annual earnings, 
and defined contribution plans, such as 401(k) plans and profit-sharing 
accounts, where you contribute set amounts each year. The amount you ultimately 
get from a defined contribution plan depends on how much was contributed and 
how well the money was invested. Defined Benefit Plans  
</P>
<P>
 If you are in a defined benefit plan, you should get a summary plan 
description. Chances are you got one when you were enrolled in the plan. But if 
you misplaced it, you can get another copy by calling or writing your plan 
administrator. If significant changes have been made to the plan, the 
administrator is also required to send you a revised description. 
</P>
<P>
 Read the plan description carefully, taking particular note of pivotal items 
such as whether overtime and bonus payments should be included in calculations 
of your retirement benefits and whether the final payout will be based on your 
highest-earnings years or your last years of service. 
</P>
<P>
 A salesman who had record sales years early in his career, for example, could 
lose out on thousands of dollars in benefits if the plan administrator 
incorrectly uses his final earnings rather than highest earnings to calculate 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have worked for company subsidiaries must determine whether those 
years are counted in the parent company's plan or whether they are separately 
covered under the subsidiary's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 If you returned to work for a company after some absence, scan the plan 
document to determine whether those early years of service count toward your 
pension benefits as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when you get your annual benefit statement, call the plan administrator 
to ensure that your wage records match theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 If, for example, they are calculating your benefits based on a $50,000 salary, 
but you actually took home $60,000 with overtime -- which, according to the 
plan description, should be included in the pension calculation -- you have a 
problem that the administrator needs to fix. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also ask how many years of service have been credited to your account 
to make sure that meshes with how long you've actually worked there. Defined 
Contribution Plans  
</P>
<P>
 Members of defined contribution plans, such as 401(k) plans, should keep pay 
stubs that indicate how much they've contributed from each paycheck. At the end 
of the year, add up the amounts, plus the stated investment return, to ensure 
that your records match with what appears on your annual benefit statement. 
</P>
<P>
 If the numbers don't match, call the plan administrator. There could be a 
mistake in how the return was calculated or there could simply be a 
typographical error. Defined contribution plans require a tremendous amount of 
data entry -- that's computerese for typing. Typographical errors usually 
result in small mistakes, but even little errors can become significant when 
left to compound for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 If you direct your own pension investments and have several options to choose 
from, the annual math test may be all you have to do. However, if the company 
determines how the assets are invested -- or if you're only given one or two 
choices of how to invest your pension money -- you should be on the lookout for 
losses. An occasional investment loss is nothing to fret about, but you should 
investigate further if your plan consistently loses money. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, plans invest funds in hard-to-value assets, such as limited 
partnerships and closely held corporations. Some administrators devalue these 
assets too aggressively, unfairly depriving plan participants of thousands of 
dollars in benefits. Dealing with Problems  
</P>
<P>
 If you find a problem that is not promptly fixed by your company or plan 
administrator, call the Labor Department and ask them to investigate. Local 
offices are listed in the government section of the phone book. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're recently retired -- or have too many years in the plan to know if 
there have been mistakes in the past -- consider having a professional review 
your payout. State bar associations can refer you to pension attorneys; the 
Pension Rights Center in Washington can refer you to local actuaries. The 
Pension Rights Center can be contacted by mail at 918 16th St., N.W., 
Washington, D.C. 20006. KATHY M. KRISTOF

REACH OUT AND, WELL, AIRTOUCH SOMEONE; MARKETING: AFTER GREAT EXPENSE AND MUCH 
AGONIZING, PACTEL CORP. SHOWS OFF ITS NEW CORPORATE NAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Freedom, spontaneity, ubiquity, interconnection. Highly personal. Perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 Advertising copy for a new fragrance? A brochure for a self-improvement 
workshop? 
</P>
<P>
 No. It's PacTel Corp. chief Sam Ginn, describing the new name for his 
$12-billion wireless communications company: AirTouch Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Forgive Ginn for using language that would make a seasoned wine critic blush 
ruby red. PacTel just spent a lot of time and money to come up with its new 
moniker. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many words already taken, legally speaking, coining a phrase is tricky 
business. It is especially tough in fields such as PacTel's, where 
technological advances beget new products and render old or poorly conceived 
names obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 PacTel, directed by regulators to rename itself as part of a corporate spinoff 
from Pacific Telesis Group, took several months to choose AirTouch from a list 
that at one time held some 3,000 names. 
</P>
<P>
 It paid tens of thousands of dollars to a specialized firm to guide the search 
and will pay far more to put AirTouch onto everything from buildings to 
beepers. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's in a name? Here's Ginn at last week's unveiling: 
</P>
<P>
 "AirTouch is the perfect name to describe what we do. Air exemplifies freedom, 
spontaneity, ubiquity. It's all around us. It's everywhere. And touch is highly 
personal, suggesting staying in touch; it's customer-focused, customer-friendly 
and relates to the concept of interconnection. 
</P>
<P>
 "But perhaps most important, AirTouch is the only name among our major 
competitors that most clearly suggests a benefit to the customer," Ginn said. 
"And it communicates a benefit without specifically saying how, which gives us 
a name that will remain viable for decades to come, regardless of changes in 
technology." 
</P>
<P>
 Pure exaggeration, said David Coursey, publisher of P.C. Letter, a newsletter 
for personal computer executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Coursey acknowledged that names are important -- he cited actors who change 
theirs as examples -- but he says a name's importance pales next to a company's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "A name can help you or a name can hurt you, but not as much as a good product 
or a bad product," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five years from now, AirTouch will have no meaning. At some point, the words 
lose their meaning entirely. I mean, what's a Dr Pepper? The company or product 
or service defines the word. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I think we make too much of them, and these people who do naming 
make fools of us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those might sound like fighting words. But Coursey won't get much of an 
argument from Rick Bragdon, the San Francisco consultant who managed the 
12-week process that led PacTel to AirTouch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I often say to my clients . . . 'Look, folks. I know this seems like life or 
death. But let's not take it too seriously, because your customers will adapt,' 
" said Bragdon, president of Addison Design Consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 So why pay so much money to companies like Addison? Why sit through all-day 
brainstorming sessions, pay for focus group studies, conduct trademark searches 
and agonize over subtle differences? 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, names do set a tone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The name really helps at the time of the change. It signals something -- 
either a new direction or a new articulation of what you are. It gives you the 
power to communicate something," said Lee Ballard, director of the Naming 
Center, a Dallas-based division of Richards Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 For another, the corporate graveyard is filled with the bodies of executives 
who infringed on existing trademarks or went mad trying to avoid it. That's why 
the name smiths are adept at combining words (AirTouch comes to mind) or making 
them up (put some Exxon in your Lexus?). 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, names are valuable corporate commodities, so you don't want to pick 
one likely to become outmoded quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking to the future," Ballard said. "We want to do it once. We want 
to do it well."

 Ford Announces Recalls: The company is recalling about 16,400 1992 and 1993 
Crown Victoria cars used by police, taxi companies and other fleets because of 
a wiring problem that could cause a fire under the front seats. It is also 
recalling about 400,000 1993 and 1994 F-Series pickup trucks and Broncos. The 
auto maker said the vehicles' front bumpers could be jarred loose because of 
faulty nuts fastening the bumpers to the vehicles.

EURO DISNEY AUDIT GIVEN TO BANKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A long-awaited audit on the ailing Euro Disney theme park was submitted Monday 
to a committee representing 60 banks that have lent money to the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Euro Disney's bankers, which have named nine banks to represent them in debt 
talks with the park's U.S. parent, Walt Disney Co., commissioned the audit by 
KPMG Peat Marwick last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Euro Disney, with $3.58-billion in debt, has said it is facing serious cash 
problems and is being financially supported until March 31 by Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The bankers and Disney are trying to find a way to ease Euro Disney's debt 
burden by that deadline. The audit report will serve as a basis for 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 One source close to the talks said the report, which was rather positive for 
Euro Disney, had been commissioned to analyze Euro Disney's past and examine 
debt restructuring proposals by Walt Disney Co. that were made in November and 
rejected by the banks waiting for the audit. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank committee could not say Monday when another meeting of the bankers 
will take place.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: AFTER 20 YEARS, STILL NO REST FOR R&R

 When Radio & Records Inc. marked its 20th anniversary last year, the past 
looked a lot brighter than the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade publication's core business, providing radio airplay information to 
record companies, had been undercut by new competition. It was also swept up in 
the financial problems of its owner, Westwood One, which surrendered R&R to 
Westinghouse Credit Corp. in November as payment of a $20-million loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next three months, R&R languished in the nether world of debt 
properties. But sources say Westinghouse is now close to an agreement to sell 
the publication to Perry Partners, a New York-based arbitrage company. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, which could be announced as early as this week, is said to be valued 
at $12 million to $15 million. Perry Partners' Richard Perry could not be 
reached for comment. But others close to the talks say R&R's management, 
including Publisher Bob Wilson, will remain on board as part of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 An industry source last week said Perry is committed to reinvigorating R&R, 
possibly in preparation for a quick resale. Wilson has told colleagues that the 
publication is close to introducing an on-line monitoring program that can 
compete with BDS, the computerized system used by rival Billboard magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 If the R&R sale goes through, it will be remembered as one of the major 
markdowns of a well-known media property. Many sources in the industry say the 
trade publication could have fetched $40 million just two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 While R&R still reaches about 60,000 people through its circulation of more 
than 8,000, industry executives say it has fallen behind technologically. R&R's 
method of collecting airplay statistics by sampling selected stations is 
considered outmoded compared to the automated BDS, which revolutionized airplay 
sampling much the way Soundscan changed the way retail sales are measured. 
</P>
<P>
 "People still take it seriously, but mainly for historic reasons," said one 
senior-level music executive. "BDS has changed everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Airplay statistics -- while irrelevant to most listeners -- are important to 
the industry in helping to shape advertising and promotional strategies, a job 
that's increasingly complicated in today's fragmented radio world. Radio 
programmers also use the reports to determine what's hot in other markets. 
</P>
<P>
 R&R can still be found on most record and radio executives' desks, though 
largely for its stories on FCC rulings, ratings and radio station personnel 
changes, as well as its insider brand of gossip. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1970s, R&R was known as the last word on airplay. One executive 
says he considered it the "dominant trade publication." 
</P>
<P>
 Westwood One bought R&R in 1986 for a reported $18.5 million. Sources say that 
Westwood One turned down an offer of $40 million from a European publisher two 
years ago, because it valued R&R at $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But soon Westwood One sustained a string of big losses. As part of his 
reorganization, Chairman Norman J. Pattiz sold off radio stations KQLZ in Los 
Angeles and WYNY in New York. He subsequently made a complex agreement with 
Infinity Broadcasting Corp. that gave Infinity operating control of the 
combined companies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pattiz put R&R on the block last April, about six months before the Infinity 
deal. A report prepared for prospective buyers by investment bankers Lazard 
Freres & Co. described R&R as "the preeminent information source for the radio 
and music industries' key decision makers." 
</P>
<P>
 The report also made the point that R&R's revenue rose from $11.7 million in 
fiscal 1989 to $14 million in fiscal 1992, a compound annual growth rate of 
6.3%. But it went on to acknowledge that advertising revenue had "consistently 
declined" since 1990 and that revenue was expected to remain flat in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Pattiz last week declined to comment on R&R's current value other than to 
confirm that Westinghouse took it as collateral for the $20-million debt. 
Others say Pattiz and Westinghouse both shopped it to several prospective 
buyers and that Wilson tried to line up his own investor group before Perry 
came along. 
</P>
<P>
 People differ on R&R's prospects. Some are skeptical of its chances of 
matching BDS' advanced airplay measuring system. But supporters say R&R's 
program may even improve on BDS. 
</P>
<P>
 R&R also retains strong support within the music industry. "It can still 
survive. The one question is whether it can reach the same heights," said one 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Another says he firmly believes R&R will come back. "It's in vogue now to 
knock it," he said. "But for the longest time it was the Bible of the industry 
. . . and they're going to be on top again." 
</P>

 Britain-bound: The Guardian, a British newspaper, is reporting that filmmaker 
Roger Corman plans to relocate to England. Corman, known as the king of the 
B-movies for efforts such as "Death Race 2000" and "Big Bad Mama," recently 
told The Times that he is close to a deal to sell his film library. The sale is 
expected to gross about $18 million. The Guardian quotes Corman as saying he 
plans to continue making his brand of low-budget movies in Britain.

JAPANESE CENTRAL BANK BOOSTS VALUE OF DOLLAR; MARKETS: THE MOVE ALLOWS 
GREENBACKS TO RISE AGAINST THE YEN. PRICE OF U.S. BONDS DROPS ON FOREIGN 
EXCHANGES.

<P>
 The U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese yen in foreign exchange markets 
Monday. U.S. bonds continued to drop in price in foreign trading, while 
Japanese stock prices jumped. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. financial markets were closed for the Presidents' Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign exchange dealers said the Japanese central bank aggressively bought 
dollars Monday to boost the greenback against the yen. The yen strengthened 
sharply last week after the two countries failed to reach agreement on cutting 
the U.S. trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The yen's rise is due to investors' fear that the U.S. government will "talk 
up" the value of the Japanese currency in order to trim the U.S. trade deficit 
and pressure Japan to make trade concessions. A stronger yen makes Japanese 
goods more expensive in the United States and U.S. goods cheaper in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 105.23 yen, up 0.66 yen from Friday's close. In 
London, the dollar was quoted at 106.30 yen, up from 104.15 on Friday. The 
dollar finished at 104.55 yen in New York on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Other dollar rates in Europe, compared to Friday, included: 1.7303 German 
marks, up from 1.7203; 1.4578 Swiss francs, up from 1.4490; 5.8837 French 
francs, up from 5.8383; 1.9416 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9270; 1,673.50 Italian 
lire, up from 1,668.00, and 1.3398 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3391. 
</P>
<P>
 The British pound was quoted at $1.4748, down from $1.4798 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei stock average climbed 434.34 points, or 
2.29%, to finish at 19,393.94. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was good reason to be positive," said Raymond Bressoud of the Union 
Bank of Switzerland's Tokyo branch. He noted that officials said a 
Cabinet-level meeting later this week will focus on steps to curb Japan's trade 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stock prices declined slightly in London, where the Financial Times-100 
index fell 32.3 points to close at 3350.3. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices also fell. The price of the U.S. Treasury's main 30-year bond was 
down 13/32 point, or $4.06 per $1,000 in face value, while its yield rose to 
6.65%. That compares to a closing yield of 6.62% on Friday in New York. Prices 
and yields move in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term Treasury securities fell 3/32 point to 1/8 point, and intermediate 
maturities fell 1/16 point to 1/4 point, the Telerate Inc. financial 
information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Commodity prices were mostly higher. North Sea crude oil for delivery in April 
rose 3 cents to close at $13.15 per barrel on the International Petroleum 
Exchange in London. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold closed in London at $379.95 an ounce, up $2.10 from Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Zurich, the bid price was $379.95, up $2.95 from Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.19 to close at a bid $380.97. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver traded in London at $5.17 a troy ounce, unchanged from Friday.

ENERGY CONTAINER OF SANTA ANA PURCHASED BY CANADIAN FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Derlan Industries Ltd. said it has agreed to buy Energy Container Corp., a 
closely held Santa Ana company that makes fuel tanks for aircraft. No purchase 
price was disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Energy Container employs 105 people and has annual sales of about $16 million. 
The company also makes valves for the petrochemical industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In connection with the acquisition, "Derlan will consolidate three of its 
California operations, together with Energy Container, into one large plant," 
Derlan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other three plants are located within a roughly 20-mile radius of the 
Energy Container plant, said Michael Forsayeth, vice president and chief 
financial officer of Toronto-based Derlan. 
</P>
<P>
 The closing of the three plants will result in a small charge, "but we don't 
expect it's going to cost a ton of money," Forsayeth said. He declined to be 
more specific.

 Do lawyers cheat on their bills? 
</P>
<P>
 "Until recently, dishonest billing by attorneys was the ethical violation that 
dared not speak its name," William Ross of the Cumberland School of Law at 
Samford University in Birmingham, Ala., wrote last year in the Journal of 
Southern Legal History. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, "as economic pressures in the legal profession have driven up 
the number of hours that attorneys bill, time-based billing has been assailed 
for encouraging inefficiency, excessive litigation and fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Ross surveyed 272 private practitioners and 80 corporate in-house 
lawyers about billing practices. More than half said lawyers "frequently" or 
"occasionally" padded their hours. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the survey, some lawyers actually billed clients for work that 
was never performed. But "time-based billing may tend to encourage inefficiency 
even more than fraud," Ross found. Hourly billing "diminishes incentives for 
expeditious work" and encourages attorneys "to proceed with work that they 
otherwise might not have performed." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see a lot of bill padding from outside counsel, but I see task 
padding -- doing more work than is really needed," said Daniel Hapke Jr., vice 
president and general counsel of General Dynamics Corp.'s Space Systems 
Division in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, the American Bar Assn.'s Standing Committee on Ethics and 
Professional Responsibility issued a "formal opinion" on "Billing for 
Professional Fees, Disbursements and Other Expenses." The committee roots its 
guidance in the principles set forth in the profession's ethical code. 
</P>
<P>
 Some issues addressed: 
</P>
<P>
 * A lawyer should not bill more than one client for the same hours, as when he 
or she does work for one client while traveling for another. 
</P>
<P>
 * If a lawyer is able to "recycle" work product, such as a research memo, for 
the benefit of another client, he "is obligated to pass the benefits of these 
economies on to the client." 
</P>
<P>
 * Lawyers should not add a charge to expenses passed along to clients. "The 
lawyer's stock in trade is the sale of legal services, not photocopy paper, 
tuna fish sandwiches, computer time or messenger services," the opinion says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross called the ABA opinion "a significant first step toward clarifying the 
ethics of billing." But, he said, "there will still be many ambiguities." 
</P>
<P>
 Many lawyers insist that unethical billing practices are the exception. "Good 
lawyers have clients' best interests at heart," says a partner in a large 
Chicago law firm.

GENERAL MOTORS TO SELL 5 PLANTS TO PARTS MANUFACTURING FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 General Motors Corp. said Monday that it is selling five parts manufacturing 
plants to American Axle & Manufacturing as part of a strategy to focus on its 
core components business. 
</P>
<P>
 Sale of the axle, propeller shaft and forging businesses in Michigan and New 
York will be effective Feb. 28.Terms of the agreement, signed Monday, were not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 7,300 people are employed at the five plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is anticipated they (AA&M) will retain all of the employees," GM 
spokeswoman Mary Irby said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're now in a position to concentrate on growing our core businesses: 
steering systems and components and front-drive axles," said Donald L. Runkle, 
GM vice president and general manager of the Saginaw Division. 
</P>
<P>
 AA&M will own axle plants in Detroit and Buffalo, N.Y.; forge plants in 
Detroit and Tonawanda, N.Y., and a propeller shaft plant in Three Rivers, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Since December, 1982, GM has been trying to sell divisions it believes can 
compete more effectively independently. GM spokesman Gerry Holmes called the 
sale to AA&M the most significant.

THE SINGLES SENSATIONS OF THE LIFELONG BACHELOR; RELATIONSHIPS: AT 40, DOES A 
NEVER-MARRIED HETEROSEXUAL HAVE TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF? COUNSELORS THEORIZE AS 
O.C.'S AVAILABLE GET SET IN THEIR WAYS. 
</P>

 Once, being a never-married bachelor entering middle age was considered to be 
a pretty good gig. There were romantic role models: the sophisticated Henry 
Higgins, the dashing James Bond. That all-time good guy, Superman. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifelong bachelors, at 40, were considered rugged individualists, urbane, 
worldly, self-aware, blissfully free, with unlimited options. They were even 
objects of envy. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the thought of a never-married, heterosexual man at age 40 produces a 
predictable reaction, but that reaction is usually worded this way: 
</P>
<P>
 "There must be something wrong with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps exacerbated by a culture in which various degrees of male-bashing have 
flourished in recent years, the idea that the never-married middle-aged man is 
somehow dysfunctional appears to have gained more than just a toehold. Is he a 
commitment-phobic? Is he a mama's boy? Is he emotionally stunted? Is he 
sexually immature? Is he a woman-hater? 
</P>
<P>
 Surely there must be something wrong with him? 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, says Charles Waehler, a psychologist at the University of Akron in 
Ohio, who conducted a study of never-married men over age 40 in 1991. The 
study, limited to white, heterosexual men, concluded that half were happy, 
successful and satisfied and the other half, while somewhat disturbed by their 
bachelor status, were too set in their ways to risk marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 This may account for the fairly large number of never-married men over 40 that 
appear in the 1990 United States Census as well as in Waehler's studies. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the census, 10.5% of white men age 40 to 44 have never married -- 
up from 7.1% in 1980. The data also show never-married black men 40 and older 
to be about twice as likely as white men to stay single. 
</P>
<P>
 A never-married status for heterosexual men at that age can be attributable to 
many reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly have nothing against marriage," said Lansing Young, 39, a teacher 
and athletics coach at Whittier High School, "and I'm not putting it completely 
out of the question. But I still feel like I'm 18. I don't feel I've changed 
that much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like kids very much, and I think kids of my own might be interesting, and I 
think I'd probably make a good father, but I'd probably make a bad husband. 
I've lived by myself for so long; I'm pretty set in my ways and self-centered. 
A woman might have a hard time putting up with that for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Young said he had an "off-and-on" relationship for about five years when he 
was in his 20s and another that lasted about a year and a half. There is no 
woman in his life at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has never been closely questioned or ridiculed about his bachelor 
status and said that if he were, "I'd probably think it was kind of comical. If 
someone ridiculed me for not being married, I'd wonder what was wrong with 
them. They don't know what my life is like." 
</P>
<P>
 He says he dates infrequently, but he said that is because he has "in the last 
few years become pretty particular about the type of woman I see. As the years 
have gone by, I've gotten much less impulsive. My brother-in-law's a divorce 
lawyer, too, and he's always said that if I ever think I might want to get 
married, to call him first, because there's a lot to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Caldwell, too, said his standards are particular, and that is mostly 
what accounts for his being a lifelong bachelor at age 57. Caldwell, a 
plastic-container manufacturer from Garden Grove, continues to date -- he is a 
member of Black Singles of Orange County -- but said he has met only one woman 
that he ever wanted to marry: a Japanese woman he met while serving in the 
military in Japan during his late 20s and early 30s. But he was discouraged by 
both military and Japanese authorities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came back to the states," he said, "I found that the women were so 
demanding," Caldwell said. "I was trying to find someone similar to the person 
I found overseas, and I just couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 He was involved in one more long-term relationship, he said, and he is 
involved with a woman now whom he said might be a marriage prospect. And, he 
added, after many years of the single life, he'd still like to be married. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I've missed out on a part of life, dealing with another human being of 
a different gender who thinks differently than I do. It's good to have someone 
to sit down and be able to talk to and who will know you well as a human being. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand, today I don't have to answer to anybody; I can come and go 
as I please. That's the advantage to being single." 
</P>
<P>
 That may not be enough of an explanation to suit many people who continue to 
see the never-married 40-year-old as a kind of social misfit, said Eugene 
Ericson, a clinical psychologist from Irvine who specializes in relationship 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, they're suspect," he said. "Occasionally, their personal dynamics may 
be such that they're just a bit shy and are comfortable with their current 
living situation and don't really venture out very much. But sometimes they're 
caught up in their work, and their work becomes their obsession. It's a matter 
of these people developing self-esteem, feeling self-worth and recognizing 
their emotional needs and how to get them fulfilled. More commonly, they're 
pretty repressed individuals, somewhat rigid and dogmatic and not flexible 
enough or emotional enough to establish a romantic bond." 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of talk, however, bothers Ben, who, at age 42, is a newlywed of 
seven months (he asked that his last name not be used). His previous lifelong 
bachelorhood had been anything but unfulfilling, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife used words like 'You're over 40 and never been married, so what's the 
matter with you?' more than once during our courtship. She figured that such a 
person was at the very least commitment-phobic, and there's probably a grain of 
truth to that. But what I told her then, and still believe, is that it's far 
better to wait than to marry young with little understanding of the qualities 
needed to make a marriage work, when people don't yet have the tools, nor the 
strength of character to reconcile the inevitable differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was younger I thought that marriage only made sense if you wanted to 
have children, and though I knew I'd want a gaggle of kids at some point, I was 
simply never ready until recently. And though I've revised that view of 
marriage, there was still never any hurry. My dad fathered me when he was 51 
years old, and I certainly never experienced any drawbacks in that 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "In any case, once I was ready to get married, well, I was ready to get 
married." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul Gray, a psychologist with practices in San Juan Capistrano and Santa 
Ana, says "My first question to a middle-aged man who has never married is, 
'have you had any long-term relationships?' If he hasn't been in such a 
relationship, I'd ask why he hasn't had that common experience that we expect 
someone of that age to have had." 
</P>
<P>
 However, said Gray, who conducts couples therapy, if the middle-aged man has 
had a number of long-term relationships in his life and remains single by 
choice, he may be perfectly healthy emotionally.

 "Let's assume the guy has had the usual relationships," Gray said. "The 
primary task of recovering from a relationship is getting to be at home with 
yourself, getting comfortable and accepting yourself as your prime source of 
entertainment. Once you've learned that, you get to really like it. Once you 
hit that place, you can live alone, and many people do. But that's not 
something that happens overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 For some men, like Albert Frias, a 40-year-old public information officer for 
the Baldwin Park School District, their bachelor status is a matter of 
geography and economics. During his 20s and 30s, Frias said he hopscotched 
around the western United States, moving up the job and pay ladder, and felt 
that it would have been a strain on a potential marriage to be moving so much 
and making so little money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it would be difficult to relocate if I was married," he said. "And at 
that time, there was no way that I'd be able to afford a wife and everything 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of marriage, he said, has not quite gone a-glimmering, but . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Now that I've just turned 40," said Frias, who said he has been seeing 
someone off and on for about four years, "I'm pretty set in my ways, and I 
don't have a lot of tolerance like I used to. I don't put up with a lot. 
Marriage isn't something I think about much anymore. If it comes, it comes." 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologist Ericson said that the aging bachelor can change his status -- 
provided he wants to -- through the development of one laudable virtue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd tell them to get some courage," said Ericson, "and to live their lives in 
a different way. To live life like a warrior. Not to fight, but to live life 
bravely."

PERSONAL HEALTH; GUIDELINES TO SLEEP BY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those who work the night shift or erratic schedules tend to toss and turn at 
bedtime. Traffic, barking dogs and family members who can't tiptoe can all 
thwart a good day's sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years, researchers have known that sleepiness varies greatly at 
different times of the day and that it is easier to sleep when body temperature 
is lower. Now, a team of Swedish researchers has found that the interval 
between sleep sessions interacts with body temperature to affect sleep quality. 
</P>
<P>
 After asking eight women in a laboratory to sleep and wake at various times 
over a 13-day period, the researchers offer this advice for those who must 
sleep at odd hours: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Stay awake for at least 12 hours (ideally longer) between sleep periods. 
</P>
<P>
 * If possible, sleep between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., when body temperature is 
lower. Women got the most sleep, nearly six hours, when they followed this 
schedule, says Torbjorn Akerstedt, the Stockholm researcher who led the study, 
published recently in the journal Sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid sleeping during the late afternoon and early evening, when body 
temperature is often highest. 
</P>
<P>
 The study makes perfect sense, says Michael M. Stevenson, clinical director of 
the North Valley Sleep Disorders Center in Mission Hills, who offers an 
additional suggestion: 
</P>
<P>
 "If you must change work schedules, move shifts forward if possible." Going 
from a 9-to-5 shift to a 4-to-midnight one, for instance, is easier on the body 
than the reverse. KATHLEEN DOHENY

A DRIVEN WOMAN; ADRIANA GIANTURCO FOUGHT A LONELY BATTLE FOR CAR-POOL LANES IN 
1976. NOW, THEY'RE A PART OF THE L.A. MAP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTIJANE LEVINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The whole city, it seemed, hated her. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers cursed her every day as they sat without moving on the Santa Monica 
Freeway, while she told them on the radio that they were zipping along just 
swell. 
</P>
<P>
 Some politicians still sputter at the mention of her name. "A woman so 
arrogant that she tried to tell us it was midnight when we could see with our 
eyes it was high noon," Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky says now, 
still irritated in retrospect. "In my 18 years of public office, she got my 
juices going in a way nobody else has been able to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so. But Adriana Gianturco's big problem, it appears now, was simply that 
she was two decades ahead of her time. 
</P>
<P>
 The year was 1976. A new governor, Jerry Brown, had appointed a new director 
of the California Department of Transportation. Gianturco seemed a good bet for 
the job: She was educated at Smith College, UC Berkeley and Harvard graduate 
school, with jobs in urban planning and transportation under her belt. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days of taking office, however, Gianturco, then 36, was, in her own 
words, "besieged, vilified, crucified." 
</P>
<P>
 Her operatic name was transposed to epithet: Giant Turkey, the Madwoman of 
Caltrans, Our Lady of the Diamond Lane. "The insults didn't stop," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither did the hate mail, obscene phone calls or death threats. "We had to 
check all packages for bombs," she remembers, "because the insanity got so out 
of hand." And for good reason, many citizens believed. 
</P>
<P>
 Popular opinion had it that Gianturco single-handedly, on a sunny mid-March 
day, rode into town from Sacramento and closed the fast lanes of the Santa 
Monica Freeway to all cars but those containing multiple occupants. 
</P>
<P>
 It was she, legend went, who christened the diamond lane, who decided that it 
would be for car-poolers only, who refused to acknowledge that the plan didn't 
work -- and who watched while the remaining three lanes of the Santa Monica 
became so clogged that citizens imagined that they could walk to work faster 
than they could get there on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time in L.A.'s memory that basic freeway freedoms had been 
tampered with. Many drivers refused to comply with the car-pool rule, weaving 
in and out of the forbidden lane just long enough to make progress, but fast 
enough to avoid police, who had been ordered to give hefty tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who didn't obey the edict could answer in court, Gianturco said over 
and over again in her clipped Back Bay accent, during what seemed a nonstop 
barrage of public appearances that assumed the character of scoldings. 
</P>
<P>
 After five months, when the entire city seemed enraged at Gianturco's 
brazenness, Yaroslavsky became the plaintiff in a federal lawsuit that put an 
end to the diamond lane -- and to the controversy. Drivers had won their four 
lanes back. Gianturco had lost her idealism.  
</P>
<P>
 "By the way," Yaroslavsky asked last week, his voice softening in what seemed 
to be genuine concern: "Whatever happened to Adriana? Did she settle into a 
good job somewhere?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's worth asking, because the idea against which so many citizens fought -- 
and for which Gianturco was willing to risk her career -- has since been 
accepted. Even Yaroslavsky says he never was opposed to the concept of diamond 
lanes -- just the way they were imposed autocratically on drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the past six months, Los Angeles County has created 130 miles of 
car-pool-only freeway lanes (not including those installed since the earthquake 
on, ironically, the Santa Monica Freeway). Orange County has 110 miles; 
Riverside County has 35. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans projects that by 1998, Southern California will have more than 600 
freeway miles reserved for high-occupancy vehicles (HOVs). The diamond-lane 
name is no longer used, a Caltrans official says, "because Gianturco's impact 
was so negative and so great that we do not want to use the diamond-lane 
designation that's still associated with her." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, says another official, who also asked not to be named, diamond lanes 
had grown so unpopular that Southern California stood still in that respect for 
nearly 18 years, while the rest of the country (including Northern California) 
has forged way ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I can laugh now, but at the time it was horrendous," Gianturco says from her 
spacious home in the Old Land Park district near downtown Sacramento, where she 
lives with husband John Saltonstall, a lawyer, and her unclipped poodle, Dusty. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been out of public life since the 1980s, when both her parents became 
ill and she took time out to care for them. Then, after a few years as a 
free-lance writer, she launched her current business of buying and 
rehabilitating historic homes. Her job as transportation director took a toll, 
she admits. But she hasn't lost her zeal or her sense of humor. And, since we 
asked, she'd be delighted to set the record straight: 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost every perception the public has about that diamond-lane project is 
incorrect," she begins, adding that it wasn't her idea -- or Brown's. "Although 
the project was activated on March 15, 1976 -- and this is important -- it was 
conceived of and planned for years before, during the term of Ronald Reagan as 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry Brown came into office on Jan. 2, 1975," she goes on, reeling off dusty 
dates as if she uses them daily. "By that time, all planning for the project 
was done; it was ready to go. Brown inherited that whole thing from Reagan; it 
was not something (Brown) dreamed up, or anything that was even high on his or 
my agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact," she says, chuckling, "I assumed office on the very same day the 
Santa Monica Freeway diamond lane went into effect." 
</P>
<P>
 So why did she fight for it so hard that it became synonymous with her name? 
</P>
<P>
 "I believed in it," she says simply. "And I was naive. I thought a public 
servant should judge things on their merit, should take full responsibility. 
The thought never occurred to me, though it certainly occurred to me later, 
that if it didn't go well, I could blame it on my predecessors. I was totally 
apolitical." 
</P>
<P>
 It was only meant to be an experiment, she says. It was essential to go ahead 
with the project, because it had been submitted to the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency to comply with the Clean Air Act of 1974. Had it not been 
carried out, federal highway funds to Southern California would have been cut 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reagan Administration's plan for Los Angeles had three major parts: Use an 
existing lane of a heavily traveled freeway (the Interstate 10) for car pools 
and buses only; build a separate car-pool and bus road (the Interstate 10's El 
Monte busway), and widen an existing freeway (the Interstate 405) by adding a 
lane for car pools and buses. "The idea was that we would do all three projects 
for a short time, compare the results, and decide which was the most 
cost-effective and efficient way to go. It made good sense," Gianturco says. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, "all hell broke loose immediately," she recalls, her voice rising in 
remembered agitation. "There was a glitch at the junction of the Harbor and the 
Santa Monica freeways, where the new signage wasn't right. Traffic backed up, 
and I got phone calls from the highest levels of government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had that fixed within a day, but the drumbeat had begun. I couldn't 
believe it; I still can't believe what happened, looking back. It was bizarre. 
The project became the center of attention of the entire city. You would have 
thought an 8-point earthquake had occurred. It was that magnitude of response." 
</P>
<P>
 Why didn't she retreat when they started calling her "un-American," 
"un-Californian," "an arrogant, power-crazed madwoman"? 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so shocked and horrified at the untruths being told that I couldn't 
retreat. I began to feel like a kind of Joan of Arc. This was a Caltrans 
project; I was director of Caltrans. I had no thought of passing the buck. Of 
course, I have learned since then that it is not the style of most department 
directors, federal or state, to get out front when there's controversy. That's 
when their aides and deputies start appearing in public and taking the flak." 
</P>
<P>
 Idealist that she was, she says, she saw it as "my mission to carry out the 
law. I went on a public speaking binge, on radio, TV, met with newspaper 
editorial boards, made public appearances in an attempt to generate 
understanding and overcome completely erroneous things being said." 
</P>
<P>
 Few listened, and even fewer believed. "They called me an outsider, but I'm a 
third-generation Californian; they said I had no experience, but I did; they 
said car-pool traffic on the 10 was nonexistent, but our figures showed it was 
increasing every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Some even thought she had named the lane after precious jewelry, she recalls, 
chuckling. "But the diamond is actually the international symbol used for buses 
and car pools," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time she left office in December, 1982, she was so well-known that the 
media referred to her by her first name only. In mischievous acknowledgment, 
Gianturco's billboards welcoming drivers to the new lane of the 405 featured a 
happy face and the single name "Adriana." 
</P>
<P>
 Did she leave public life because she couldn't take the insults anymore? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not at all," she says with a laugh. "It's true I was alone and devastated 
much of the time; my new husband was working in Boston. Every weekend I'd go 
home in Sacramento and collapse. Then I'd pull myself together for Monday and 
start all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the freeway fiasco lasted only five months; I stayed in that job for 
(nearly) seven years. Then I wanted to try new things." 
</P>
<P>
 The episode benefited her in certain ways, she says. It made her "more 
resolute" to do what's right, because she knew she could "survive the worst 
criticism without falling apart." 
</P>
<P>
 She also gets satisfaction, she says, knowing that "all the stuff we talked 
about years ago is the stuff that's finally happening now. Car-pool lanes, the 
Metrolink, the idea of using existing rail lines are all programs that we 
started way back then." 
</P>
<P>
 It's so gratifying, she says, with a mysterious lilt in her voice, that she 
"just might consider going back into public life again."

A NIGHT OF WINE, ROSES AND MANCINI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Henry Mancini, the Oscar-winning composer of numerous film scores including 
"The Pink Panther," "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and "The Days of Wine and Roses," 
was low-key and amiable at a reception in his honor following his appearance 
with the Pacific Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 guests greeted Mancini at the Center Club in Costa Mesa Friday after 
attending the orchestra's Pops Series concert at the nearby Orange County 
Performing Arts Center. The gala was to thank members of the Maestro Society 
who contribute at least $1,500 a year to the orchestra. High Notes 
</P>
<P>
 After leading the orchestra and his six-piece combo in a wide range of 
material, from classic '50s rock tunes to his recent score for "Tom and Jerry," 
Mancini showed up at the party a changed man -- dressed in a casual black 
leather bomber jacket and khaki pants instead of his suit and tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone wanted to meet the 69-year-old composer who has won 20 Grammy awards 
and four Academy Awards, and Mancini good-naturedly obliged with handshakes all 
around. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need people like you . . . to support the orchestra," he told a circle of 
admirers. Then, turning to one guest, he joked, "You liked my piano playing?" 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he reflected on one of the sentimental segments of the concert, a 
tribute to the late Audrey Hepburn, for whom he wrote the famous "Moon River." 
During the performance, Mancini said he still preferred Hepburn's version of 
the song even over those other "blue eyes" -- Frank Sinatra and Andy Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Audrey and I were very good friends. She was one of the few people who came 
across on screen exactly as she did in person," he said. "She showed her class, 
especially with her work with UNICEF. She sure inspired me." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the eclectic choice of material he performed that evening, 
Mancini said he's drawn to all kinds of music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take things from everywhere. I'm sneaky because I have to be. If I'm 
writing songs for a country-Western picture, I have to know about country 
music." 
</P>
<P>
 Mancini is currently composing the music for the Broadway production of 
"Victor/Victoria." A Perfect Arrangement 
</P>
<P>
 For party-goers, the pairing of Mancini with the Pacific Symphony Orchestra 
made for a fine duet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mancini and the orchestra loved each other -- you could tell," said Walter 
Schroeder, who with wife Gerry underwrote the concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked all of the songs, especially the ones from the '50s," Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Spisto, vice president and executive director of the orchestra, said 
Mancini is wonderful on and off stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not only a great musician, he's a great person. He and his wife, Ginny, 
have given so much to the arts all over Southern California," Spisto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others attending were George and Arlene Cheng, Jim and Velma Emmi, David and 
Susan Gerke, Mike and Ellie Gordon, Maurice and Marcy Mulville, George and Anne 
Schopick and Peggy and Sally Segerstrom. KATHRYN BOLD

 It's not just the content that has some health experts concerned about 
commercials for alcoholic beverages. It's where the commercials are placed. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers Joel Grube and Patricia Madden suggest in a new study that ads for 
alcoholic beverages -- particularly beer -- reach even more kids when they are 
sandwiched during televised sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
 Grube and Madden reviewed 443 hours of televised sporting events (166 events) 
and found more ads for alcoholic beverages than for any other beverage: 685 
alcohol commercials in 443 hours of events -- that computes to just more than 
1.5 alcohol commercials for each hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 25 messages or public service announcements on the potential dangers of 
alcohol aired during that time, according to the study, published in the 
February issue of the American Journal of Public Health.

HEALTH WATCH; SICK DAYS REALLY DO ADD UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stumped for small talk? Feel free to share these sick facts and figures from 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics at your next dinner party: 
</P>
<P>
 * Americans call in sick more than 2.1 million times per month. 
</P>
<P>
 * The flu is the biggest reason for illness (averaging 76 days a year per 
workplace), followed by strains and sprains (30), fractures and dislocations 
(23) and common cold (21); "female problems" (5) account for the least-given 
reason for absenteeism. 
</P>
<P>
 * Federal employees rack up the highest rate of absenteeism. 
</P>
<P>
 * Of those federal employees, the neither-rain-nor-snow folks down at the U.S. 
Postal Service clock the most sick days -- 5,752,180 a year. (That's more than 
the Army and Navy combined.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clear the Air: People who run in the city should avoid tree-lined streets. 
Researchers at the University of Texas School of Public Health say auto exhaust 
gets trapped under the leaves and raises carbon monoxide levels. Scientists 
suggest that you take your running to open spaces, such as parks or along 
rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's Good For You: You know that breakfast is the most important meal of the 
day, but why, Mommy, why ? 
</P>
<P>
 Says Cindy Moore, director of Nutrition Services at the Cleveland Clinic 
Foundation: 
</P>
<P>
 * Breakfast is the easiest time to find foods low in fat and high in complex 
carbohydrates. Cereals, toast, bagels, pita bread and English muffins can be 
good sources of B vitamins, minerals and fiber -- especially if whole-grain 
items are chosen, such as whole-wheat toast or bran cereals. Fat and calories 
come into the picture when you add buttery toppings. Go for fruit jams and 
spreads instead. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eating a healthy breakfast can help reduce mid-morning hunger pangs and the 
desire for higher calorie and higher fat snack foods, such as doughnuts, chips 
and pastries. 
</P>
<P>
 * Breakfast is also a good time to get a head start on eating fruit during the 
day, since the U.S. Dietary Guidelines recommend two to four servings per day. 
A banana, orange, apricots, cantaloupe, strawberries, raisins or a half of 
grapefruit will fill you up, in addition to providing vitamins A, C, folic acid 
and minerals such as potassium and fiber. 
</P>

SEAGAL POWERS HOLIDAY WEEKEND; BOX OFFICE: AN ESTIMATED $80 MILLION IN RECEIPTS 
PUTS THIS PRESIDENTS DAY WEEKEND 10% AHEAD OF LAST YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Led by a hefty $14-million gross for Steven Seagal's "On Deadly Ground" and 
despite strong viewer competition from the Winter Olympics on CBS-TV, the movie 
business earned a gold medal of its own during the Presidents Day Weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Film industry sources estimated that the Friday-through-Monday holiday weekend 
would produce slightly more than $80 million in ticket sales, or about 10% more 
than the same holiday weekend a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best weekend of the year so far, and that's despite the high ratings 
for the Olympics. Not everyone watches the games and even those who do can 
still grow tired after a while," said John Krier of Exhibitor Relations Co., 
which tracks box-office data. 
</P>
<P>
 One indication of the robustness of the business is the rare situation for a 
winter weekend that three films -- "On Deadly Ground," "Ace Ventura: Pet 
Detective" and "Blue Chips" -- topped $10 million in ticket sales each. 
</P>
<P>
 The high grosses were a sharp contrast to a weekend earlier, when arctic-like 
weather shut down much of the eastern United States, affecting about 25% of the 
box office. 
</P>
<P>
 About $25 million of the $80-million Presidents Day Weekend total belongs to 
two Warner Bros. movies, "On Deadly Ground" and the weekend's No. 2 film, the 
strong-showing children's comedy "Ace Ventura." 
</P>
<P>
 With $14 million estimated for the long weekend on 2,010 screens, "On Deadly 
Ground," an environmentally themed action film in which Seagal not only stars 
but makes his directing debut, landed in first place by a long shot. But, as 
strong an opening weekend as that is, the action hero's biggest opening remains 
1992's "Under Siege," which also collected $14 million, during a regular 
Friday-through-Sunday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranked second is "Ace Ventura, Pet Detective," starring Jim Carrey, from 
Fox-TV's "In Living Color." The film, which cost Morgan Creek Productions $12 
million to produce, grossed $10.5 million during the most recent weekend on 
1,923 screens, bringing its total after only three weekends of release to $38 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Reardon, Warner Bros.' president of distribution, said he is surprised 
about the extent of the movie's box-office appeal. "It's drawing the kids, and 
that's the main thing," he said. "There's a lot of repeat business."  
</P>
<P>
 The Nick Nolte basketball drama, "Blue Chips," and a '90s twentysomething 
romantic comedy, "Reality Bites," scored three and four, respectively, in their 
debut weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blue Chips," from Paramount Pictures, grossed $10.1 million on 1,910 screens. 
But at only 1,149 locations, Universal Pictures' "Reality Bites," with Ben 
Stiller, Ethan Hawke and Winona Ryder, grossed an estimated $6.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney Pictures' "Blank Check" drew $6.1 million on 1,732 screens, for 
fifth place.  
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the Top 10 are "Schindler's List," with $5 million (and $42 
million to date); "Mrs. Doubtfire," with $4.9 million ($193 million to date); 
"My Girl 2," with $4.8 million on 1,853 screens; "My Father, the Hero," $4.4 
million on 1,363 screens, and "Philadelphia," $4.3 million on 1,449 screens 
($56.1 million to date).

THE SHILTS LEGACY LIVES ON; MOVIES: TWO OF HIS BOOKS ARE BEING MADE INTO FILMS 
BY HBO AND WARNER BROS. AND NBC WILL REPLAY HIS 'AND THE BAND PLAYED ON.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Randy Shilts, one of the brightest literary lights in the gay community, died 
of AIDS last week at age 42. The filming of two projects based on his books -- 
and the rebroadcast of another -- however, ensures that his spirit will live 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC, which once had the rights to "And the Band Played On" -- Shilts' 
best-selling account of the rise of the AIDS epidemic -- plans to air the movie 
in the wake of its original success on HBO last September. Warner Bros. will 
move ahead on Shilts' 1982 "The Mayor of Castro Street" -- the biography of the 
slain gay San Francisco politician Harvey Milk -- as soon as a director, a star 
and a finished script are in tow. And HBO is banking that "Conduct Unbecoming," 
the 1993 examination of gays in the military, will prove to be yet another of 
the channel's trademark "event" movies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Randy had a great reservoir of information and a remarkable way of 
interweaving fact and entertainment," says Janet Yang, president of Oliver 
Stone's Ixtlan, which is executive producing both "Mayor" and "Conduct." "He 
tells a really good story. (After his death) I suspect, he'll be appreciated 
even more." 
</P>
<P>
 Good stories or not, Shilts' work has never been an easy sell. ABC passed on 
"And the Band Played On" before NBC picked it up and then passed it along. And 
"Mayor" producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron were turned down by every major 
studio and a handful of production companies before enlisting the support of 
Stone four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oliver was originally going to direct as well, but decided he didn't want to 
do another assassination movie after 'JFK,' " says Zadan. "Still, ("Mayor") 
wouldn't have been made without him. When he single-handedly championed the 
project, people suddenly took note. Warners wasn't the only one interested -- 
just the most passionate." 
</P>
<P>
 Writers David Franzoni (HBO's "Citizen Cohn") and Becky Johnston ("Prince of 
Tides") were assigned to write Milk's tale and, at one time, Robin Williams had 
been slated for the lead. At Stone's suggestion, Gus Van Sant ("My Own Private 
Idaho") was brought in to direct. When his vision failed to correspond to that 
of the producers, however, both parties decided to part ways last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gus wanted a strange, quirky, art-house film," says Zadan. "If we had only 
one shot at the subject, we wanted it to reach as wide an audience as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Scripts have been sent to some possible replacements with whom the producers 
will meet in the next few weeks. Casting "Mayor," which is reportedly budgeted 
at just under $20 million, will kick in after that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If we do a halfway decent job, there's a market for this film," Yang 
maintains. "There's a real hunger for gay-themed and cross-dressing stories 
these days. Look at 'The Crying Game,' 'Mrs. Doubtfire' and 'Philadelphia,' of 
course. 'Philadelphia' could have been more 'gay' and still gotten an audience. 
They played it pretty safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the mega-success of "And the Band Played On" and the front-page 
controversy surrounding gays in the military, 1993's "Conduct Unbecoming" 
managed to sidestep some of the hurdles thrown in the path of Shilts' earlier 
works. Ron Bernstein, who represented Shilts at the Gersh Agency, contacted the 
Stone contingent, which in turn approached HBO Pictures. They ultimately agreed 
to co-produce the project, along with Propaganda Films. Ixtlan brought in Zadan 
and Meron to co-executive produce. Hugh Whitemore ("Pack of Lies") is now 
writing the script. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this picture has the potential to be another 'Barbarians at the 
Gate,' " says Bill Bence, director of HBO Pictures Publicity. "And even if it's 
not, 'Conduct' fits into our overall objective: offering timely, cutting-edge 
films you won't see on the networks that people are willing to pay money for." 
That was the case with "And the Band Played On," which NBC sold to HBO after 
repeated efforts to develop the project failed. Sources say questions about 
whether mainstream audiences would buy the subject matter, and concerns about 
advertiser pullout played a key role in the decision -- a contention the 
network, which may air the show in the spring, denies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a massive undertaking," says Flody Suarez, NBC's senior director of 
entertainment press. "We felt that we couldn't do it justice or attract the 
right kind of talent on a TV-movie budget. Fear of controversy wasn't an 
overriding concern. TV has to address issues such as these, or the medium will 
become very bland. After seeing the program on HBO, we felt it deserved a mass 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
 The network could also be said to have a ratings incentive: HBO, which reaches 
less than 20% of U.S. households, drew a 25% share with the Sept. 11 show. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his illness, Shilts remained active on the film versions of "Mayor" 
and "Conduct." Every draft of the scripts was sent to him for notes. No matter 
that he was so emotionally invested in the material, say his colleagues; he was 
less proprietary and more trusting in the system than most. 
</P>
<P>
 "Randy pushed that much harder at the end," recalls Yang. "I think he had a 
time-line in his head." 
</P>
<P>
 Zadan says that Shilts, who will be memorialized at Glide Memorial United 
Methodist Church in San Francisco this afternoon, was so intent on finishing 
"Conduct Unbecoming" that he never took time out to deal with his illness.  
</P>
<P>
 "Randy was completely driven, a man on a mission. He wrote three landmark 
books. He was a brilliant -- and controversial -- spokesperson for the gay 
community. His untimely death gives us even greater incentive not only to make 
the films, but to do them in a way that would make him proud."

A 'TRUE TO LIFE' TRIUMPH; YEARS OF STRUGGLING PAY OFF FOR SELF-TAUGHT SINGER 
LISETTE MELENDEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The list of Latino women who have had big pop hits in recent years is a short 
one: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Gloria Estefan. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Lisa Lisa. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's it. 
</P>
<P>
 To many, that's evidence that the record business discriminates against Latina 
singers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not true," declares Lisette Melendez. 
</P>
<P>
 A Puerto Rican from New York's Spanish Harlem, she's become the only Latina 
singer to break through in the pop market in the '90s. Melendez, whose second 
album, "True to Life" -- featuring the single "Goody Goody" -- has just been 
released, had record company doors slammed in her face throughout the late '80s 
when she was looking for a record deal. But she never felt that her being 
Latina was the reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was a problem I didn't know it," says Melendez, whose music spans dance 
and hip-hop/R&B styles. "They said the problem was the music. I was trying to 
get a deal based on a song that nobody really liked. My feeling was that they 
were rejecting the song, not me." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Melendez -- who won't tell her age but appears to be in her late 20s 
-- sees the record industry as a bastion of racial equality. But she believes 
that, to label executives, skin color and ethnic background always take a back 
seat to one thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money is all that matters," she insists. 
</P>
<P>
 David Harleston, president of Def Jam Records -- the parent company of 
Melendez's label, Fever Records -- agrees.  
</P>
<P>
 "If there's money to be made, no one in this business is going to back away 
from an artist because she's a Latina," he said in a separate interview. 
"Crossing some artists over from a small specialty market into the pop market 
is tough. But once an artist breaks through, it's easier for others to make it. 
If Lisette becomes a star, record companies will start looking for other 
Latinas to sign." 
</P>
<P>
 The real problem in the record business, Melendez insists, has nothing to do 
with ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are just afraid to take chances on music," she says. "A lot of 
potential hits -- and hit artists -- never get a chance because people are 
afraid to gamble. I struggled for years because no one wanted to gamble on me." 
</P>
<P>
 But producer Carlos Berrios finally did, and it paid off with two independent 
late-'80s dance hits -- "Make Noise" and "Together Forever" -- that paved the 
way for her to record her dance-oriented debut album, "Together Forever," in 
1991. That one did well enough, selling more than 200,000 copies, to establish 
her as the most promising Latina singer in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a self-taught singer who started out singing along with Barbra 
Streisand records as a teen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't hold notes or sing a melody well in the beginning, but I kept at 
it until I got pretty good at it," Melendez recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Perseverance is one of her biggest assets. Without it, Melendez insists, she'd 
be just another hopeful looking for a way out of Spanish Harlem. "Looking back 
on it, I don't know why I didn't quit," she says. "I was this shy kid trying to 
get into the music business. I had no contacts. But I forced myself to meet 
people and inched my way along. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spanish Harlem is tough, and things can seem real hopeless there," she 
continues. "I didn't want to be like the kids who give up when they're 
teen-agers and just get into trouble -- go to jail or whatever. I kept working 
at singing and hoped it might get me out of what looked like a dead-end 
situation. Even when I made contacts and got into the business, I wasn't 
getting anywhere. But Carlos would push me, and I kept pushing myself, thinking 
I'd make it to the big time one day." 
</P>
<P>
 Her new album, she hopes, will be the ticket to the big time. Not only does it 
feature a variety of music -- pop and R&B as well as dance -- but it also 
launches her new image. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much sexier," explains Melendez, who still lives with her mother in 
Spanish Harlem. "I was always this home girl that the Latina girls could relate 
to. I don't want to lose that identity because I know I'm a role model for 
those kids. But I come across sexier now." 
</P>
<P>
 Why the new image? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm close to breaking big -- so close I can feel it," she replies. "I wanted 
to do something different, something that would take me to the next level. So I 
change the image. If that doesn't work I'll try something else -- anything to 
get me to that next level."

TRASH LANDING; HISTORY: SMITHSONIAN CLAIMS SHUTTLE ENGINE MOCK-UPS ARE AT 
MUSEUM, BUT ROCKWELL SAYS THEY WERE UNCEREMONIOUSLY DUMPED IN A LANDFILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Depending on whom you believe, an important part of this country's space 
exploration history is either in the Smithsonian Institution or decaying in the 
hot sun in a Palmdale landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 Space shuttle builder Rockwell International says that more than a decade ago 
it sent to the dump a set of shuttle engine mock-ups that were used as part of 
the test program for the Enterprise -- the first orbiter ever built. 
</P>
<P>
 But what Rockwell said it disposed of at the dump are the same exact things 
the National Air and Space Museum in Washington believes it has in its 
collection. The museum says the shuttle engine nozzles are attached to the back 
of the Enterprise, a non-flying orbiter used for testing in the late 1970s that 
was donated by NASA to the museum in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The mock-ups were used in approach and landing tests that included putting 
Enterprise atop a modified 747 and releasing it 26,000 feet above the expansive 
dry lake beds at Edwards Air Force Base to see if it could, in fact, glide to 
an unpowered landing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell officials said just one set of the mock-ups was built and they are 
the ones at the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the real approach and landing nozzles are out there in California, then 
what do we have?" asked Valerie Neal, a curator for the museum's department of 
space history. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Valentino, who has been general manager of the Palmdale dump for nearly 
two decades, said the three shuttle engine nozzles, which were designed to 
simulate the size, shape and weight of the real space shuttle main engines, 
arrived at the landfill several years ago during the town's annual cleanup 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell, which builds the space shuttles at its facility at Air Force Plant 
42 in Palmdale, no longer had a use for the nozzles and so, with the blessing 
of the government, disposed of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than storing them, because they have no functional value or purpose 
down the line, Rockwell and NASA property managers decided to dispose of them," 
said Alan Buis, a spokesman for Rockwell Space Systems Division. "That's how 
they ended up where they currently are." 
</P>
<P>
 But museum curator Neal is confident Rockwell must be mistaken about the 
mock-ups it sent to the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to a couple people who were here when Enterprise was delivered," she 
said. "We were never notified that anything on Enterprise was not part of the 
test configuration." 
</P>
<P>
 But if Rockwell is right, historians and museum curators fear that a piece of 
history is weathering in the desert sun, in a dump, no less. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is disturbing," said Derek Elliott, who was curator of the Air and Space 
Museum's manned space collection at the time Enterprise arrived. Elliott is now 
a history professor at Tennessee State University in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott said that when Enterprise was given to the museum, no one thought to 
ask if the nozzles were the ones used in the tests at Edwards Air Force Base. 
It was just assumed they were. 
</P>
<P>
 Through an agreement between NASA and the Smithsonian, NASA is supposed to 
offer anything considered a potential artifact to the museum before discarding 
it. Elliott said it is possible that when the nozzles were dumped, the process 
broke down or NASA didn't realize their historical value. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if we didn't acquire them, I can almost guarantee some other space 
history museum or center would be interested in something like that," Elliott 
said. "It's part of this nation's history, the history of the space shuttle." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Elliott said, items that historians and curators believe significant are 
not always judged as such by others. 
</P>
<P>
 James Hartsfield, NASA shuttle program spokesman at the Johnson Space Center 
in Texas, said, "It's not unique that you found engine mock-ups in a dump in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 He said various junked mock-ups from the Apollo program can be found at 
landfills near the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Palmdale landfill manager Valentino isn't all that eager to give up 
what he sees as his piece of space history. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he's never been sure exactly what they are, he has kept the mock-ups 
from being buried under tons of grass clippings, tin cans and used tires. They 
sit near an old, discarded dinghy and appear to be used as a resting place and 
toilet facility for the many dump-scavenging birds that frequent the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 It may not be the Smithsonian, but eventually, Valentino says he's going to 
put the three engine nozzles on display and show them during tours.

COUNTY FEARS LOSSES AS PROPERTY TAX CLAIMS RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dispatch from the trenches of the property tax revolt, Los Angeles County 
sector: No casualties yet, but tempers are on hair triggers.  
</P>
<P>
 Consider Gary Winter. 
</P>
<P>
 The West Hills homeowner stood up at a recent hearing with his arms tightly 
crossed and anger in his eyes. The tax madness just has to stop, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't even sell my house for $435,000 and you're taxing me like it's still 
worth $590,000," said Winter, an executive for a film company. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to be an idiot not to know that a house bought in 1989 is not 
worth the same in 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 Winter's salvo isn't the only one being fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Anxious to capitalize on declining real estate values, the owners of more than 
134,000 homes and businesses have bombarded Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego 
counties in the past two years with requests for lower property tax bills. In 
Los Angeles County alone, more than 35,000 claims have been filed so far this 
fiscal year -- the equivalent of seven normal years' workload. 
</P>
<P>
 No statewide figures are available, but tax experts said most of the requests 
are raining down on Southern California counties because the real estate market 
here is suffering the steepest decline in the state -- down an average of about 
20% from its 1989-90 peak. 
</P>
<P>
 The hail of assessment appeals has county officials scurrying for cover. With 
a two-year legal limit to process each claim, time is fast running out on the 
41,767 cases pending in Los Angeles County. If the county fails to meet the 
deadline, the property owner's valuation (usually lower) automatically becomes 
the basis on which the taxes are collected.  
</P>
<P>
 Since that could lead to untold millions of dollars in lost tax revenue, the 
county recently allocated $661,000 for extra staff in an effort to move the 
appeals through the system on time. And local officials are working with the 
California State Assn. of Counties to get a law passed that would give counties 
an extra year to process the claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really in a state of panic," said Dan Wall, the association's revenue 
and taxation lobbyist. "Here is a hugely significant revenue source that 
accounts for 20% of the state's total tax revenues, and it's under fire."  
</P>
<P>
 Wall said the attack is being mounted by two types of tax warriors: people 
with legitimate claims and those who are trying to take advantage of the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some folks know there is this huge backlog and are playing a little game of 
chance in the hopes that the assessors won't get to the appeal in time," Wall 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles County officials believe that most of the claims are 
legitimate because property values have, indeed, declined. But they caution 
that homeowners, who comprise about 70% of the applicants, may have to settle 
for smaller reductions than they desire.  
</P>
<P>
 "The people who wind up at these hearings are often very confused about the 
procedures, but they accurately perceive that they are deserving of some type 
of break," said Marvin Lane, a division chief with the county assessor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the declining real estate market, the county last year 
voluntarily reduced the property tax bills of about 240,000 of the 350,000 
people who purchased homes between late 1988 and early 1992. As a result, it 
lost more than $80 million of the $4.9 billion in property taxes it could have 
collected. 
</P>
<P>
 But it gained an unexpected ally -- the conservative Howard Jarvis Taxpayers 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Assessor Kenneth P. Hahn "deserves a lot of praise from taxpayers for lowering 
the bills," said Kris Vosburgh, executive director of the taxpayers' group. "We 
think the appeals system is still fair even though it's a little slow." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's a different story on the front lines, where scores of angry 
homeowners who didn't get automatic tax breaks are challenging county 
bureaucrats at a dozen government offices throughout Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "People verbally attack me and I have to take it," said Cleo Davis, a hearing 
officer who presided during a hearing in Van Nuys earlier this month at which 
Winter spoke. "I try to be nice to everybody, but after four or five hours of 
sitting here, it's not easy."  
</P>
<P>
 Winter's case demonstrates the pitfalls of doing battle without the proper 
weapons -- a thorough understanding of the arcane, time-consuming appeals 
process and the right facts and figures.  
</P>
<P>
 Property taxes are calculated as a percentage of the appraised value of the 
house -- about 1.25% annually, including bonds and assessment district fees. 
Appraised values, and thus taxes, usually rise by about 2% a year. In times of 
declining prices, a homeowner can request a reassessment by claiming that the 
house is worth less today than what was paid for it. The tax reductions will 
last until the economy improves, county officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers who appeal an assessment have three choices: negotiate a settlement 
with the assessor's office; opt for a meeting with a hearing officer who 
listens to evidence presented by a county appraiser and the homeowner, then 
recommends an assessment; or present their case before one of the county's 
three-member appeals boards, whose decision is final. 
</P>
<P>
 In Winter's case, his three-bedroom house with three bathrooms and a pool is 
currently assessed at $590,465, reflecting the top-dollar price of $525,000 he 
paid in 1989 when the market was peaking, plus improvements he made and annual 
tax increases. He therefore owes the county about $7,381 in annual property 
taxes.  
</P>
<P>
 But Winter, who recently married and purchased another residence with his 
wife, says he offered the house for sale in 1992 and couldn't even get the 
rock-bottom price of $435,000. He wants the county to drop the assessed value 
to $408,000, based on a professional appraisal and recent sales of comparable 
properties in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 At that rate, Winter would pay about $5,100 in property taxes, or about $2,281 
less than under the current assessment.  
</P>
<P>
 But the county is only willing to drop Winter's taxes to $5,937, based on an 
assessed value of $475,000, which would force him to pay $837 more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will we starve without that money? No, but we've got $30,000 in earthquake 
damage and a daughter to educate," said Winter's wife, Jackie. "And I can't 
believe we're alone in saying that in these times, a $2,000 tax break would 
really help us." 
</P>
<P>
 The county arrived at the higher assessment based on comparable sales of 
similar houses in Winter's West Hills neighborhood through May 31, 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies one of the rules that caught Winter off guard.  
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, the county can only take into account the decline that 
occurred through the end of the fifth month (May) of the year the appeal was 
filed. But Winter had to wait almost a year for his case to be heard because of 
the county's backlog. So by the time he got a hearing, the value of his 
property may have indeed declined even further than when he requested the 
reduction.  
</P>
<P>
 But to qualify for further reductions, Winter will have to reapply. He and 
other taxpayers can expect delays of six to 18 months for requests filed this 
year, unless they are willing to negotiate a settlement with the assessor's 
office over the phone, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, they must pay the full amount of their bills while they wait 
to find out if they qualify for a refund.  
</P>
<P>
 "You know the game and we don't," Winter said angrily to Davis during the 
hearing when it became clear he would not get his way. "We didn't know what to 
bring. We thought it was going to be just you. We didn't realize it was like a 
trial with someone from the assessor's office to play the part of the 
prosecution. You're trying to railroad this through." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just a worker," Davis responded, falling back on bureaucrats' age-old 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is so frustrating," Winter said. "I just want what is fair."  
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, Winter and others like him are already winners under California's 
tax system because they pay some of the lowest tax rates in the nation. Under 
Proposition 13, the government can lower property assessments to reflect true 
market value in bad times but is prohibited from raising them above 2% 
annually. In boom times, that's far less than the property is actually worth, 
said Lenny Goldberg, a spokesman for the California Tax Reform Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 But Winter doesn't plan to surrender the cause. Stalking out of the 15-minute 
hearing earlier this month, he vowed to take his case to the assessment appeals 
board -- with one major difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "On appeal," he said, "we're going to be much, much better prepared." Tax

 From the African American who owned much of what is now the San Fernando 
Valley in the 1790s to the high school student who has devoted himself to 
keeping his peers out of gangs, people of African descent in the Valley have a 
long, proud history.  
</P>
<P>
 In this special report, we look back at some of that history and -- with the 
help of several voices from the present -- turn to the future. 
</P>
<P>
 * PACOIMA / Workshops Teach Youth Black Heritage 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy enough to learn a little bit of black history in February, during 
Black History Month. It's another matter to learn a lot about it on 27 Saturday 
mornings throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
 While friends sleep late or tune in a football game, two dozen young students 
are getting a better glimpse of the missing pages of American history as part 
of the Saturday Enrichment Program at the Pacoima Community Center, sponsored 
by the California Black Family Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a full-flower course like school," explained Tammy Warfield, a 
junior and psychology major at Cal State Northridge who volunteers to tutor the 
students. "I throw out a couple of names and we talk. In school, they usually 
learn about Martin Luther King Jr., Sojourner Truth and Malcolm X." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Warfield finished a recent session, students could add George 
Washington Carver, Langston Hughes, Paul Robeson, Mary McLeod Bethune, James 
Weldon Johnson and Duke Ellington to their repertoires. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a history book of about 400 pages, they usually might have three or four 
pages, and that's on slavery," Warfield lamented. "Well, our history is more 
than that. We did some things before and some things after." 
</P>
<P>
 Even through early-morning grogginess and short attention spans, the lessons 
penetrated. Janet Broadous, whose mother, Deborakh Broadous, helped organize 
the course, quickly recognized James Weldon Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wrote 'Lift Every Voice and Sing' with his brother," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a lawyer, a writer, a preacher. . . ." Warfield prompted. "How about 
Mary McLeod Bethune?" 
</P>
<P>
 "She started a college with $1.50," shouted Vakysha Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to forming the Florida school that later became Bethune-Cookman 
College, she founded the National Council of Negro Women. 
</P>
<P>
 As an educator and mother, Deborakh Broadous had double motivation to help 
organize the tutoring sessions. She heard experts say that government programs 
were not meeting the needs of African Americans, especially children. And 
African American parents were being told that their children were not 
performing well in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadous and fellow CSUN alumni decided to form the California Black Family 
Institute, based on the institutions they felt were strongest -- church and 
family. "Our Roots Are Our Strength" became the motto of the institute, which 
offers a variety of counseling and educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although students appreciate the institute's help in English, computer 
science, mathematics and Spanish, it's history that seems to bind it together, 
Broadous said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One student said to me, 'I need this 52 weeks of the year,' " she said. "A 
lot of the kids are not college bound, and we've seen them turn around and say: 
'Yeah, I'm going to go to college.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Vakysha found the tutoring both daunting and inspiring. "Personally, it makes 
me realize there's a lot of knowledge I don't have," she said. "What they 
really need to do is teach everyone's history, then we'd know more about each 
other. There'd be a lot less violence." GEOFFREY MOHAN

 From the African American who owned much of what is now the San Fernando 
Valley in the 1790s to the high school student who has devoted himself to 
keeping his peers out of gangs, people of African descent in the Valley have a 
long, proud history.  
</P>
<P>
 In this special report, we look back at some of that history and -- with the 
help of several voices from the present -- turn to the future. 
</P>
<P>
 * NORTHRIDGE / Roots of Change Seen at CSUN in '60s 
</P>
<P>
 Before "Roots" ever made it to television, before the term African American 
came into use on the pages of newspapers, the idea of recapturing African 
American heritage transfixed a generation of young black Americans at San 
Fernando Valley State College. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to recover that heritage, students at what is now Cal State Northridge 
staged a series of protests in the late 1960s, prompting the formation of one 
of the nation's oldest Afro-American studies departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, 25 years later, the fruit of their labor still remains. The Pan-African 
studies department at CSUN is considered to be one of the strongest departments 
of its kind in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The series of explosive clashes to which it owes its existence began in 
November of 1968, after an incident between an African American athlete and a 
Valley State coach. Rumors spread quickly that the athlete had been kicked by 
the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kick was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back," said Kenneth 
Collins, now a Valley contractor and an acquaintance of the student who was 
reportedly kicked. A demonstration ensued, and Collins, then still a high 
school student, was one of the participants.  
</P>
<P>
 As Collins describes it, the protest quickly took on a life of its own. The 
crowd surged into the administration building, sweeping him with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared to death," Collins recalled. "I didn't really know what was 
going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 His participation was short-lived: Older students noticed his young face and 
ushered him outside. Those who remained took 34 campus employees hostage that 
day. The standoff ended with a score of arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidents continued throughout the tense winter months. In January, Delmar 
Oviatt, then acting college president, canceled a planned convocation in which 
students were to address the faculty, according to Life magazine, which 
recounted the events in an article in March of that year. The students marched. 
More arrests followed. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Jan. 9, marked a turning point. A total of 256 students were 
arrested in a massive protest, according to newspaper articles from the time. 
Led by the Black Student Union, they named the creation of an Afro-American 
Studies department as one of several demands. They were backed by a broad array 
of community leaders, faculty and students, both black and white. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiations that followed resulted in the creation of the departments of 
Afro-American studies and Mexican-American studies, now called Pan-African 
studies and Chicano studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Zedar E. Broadous, now president of the Valley branch of the National 
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, remembers the dread and 
uncertainty he felt as an activist at that time: "There was nothing to stop 
someone from just walking in your house and just killing you and your family," 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Now, we want to talk about the feel-good side of it (the civil rights 
movement)." he said. "But at the time there was not a feel-good side to it."  
</P>
<P>
 James Dennis, CSUN professor of Pan-African studies, was one of the pioneering 
faculty members in the new department. He said the purpose of the program today 
remains what it was in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 "First and foremost, it's to get knowledge about black experience into the 
heads of black folks," he said. "Black folks are very culturally deprived. We 
don't study ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 As Broadous describes it, the students of Valley State had awakened in the 
'60s to the realization that slavery and generations of oppression had 
afflicted African Americans with what he called a "forced amnesia." They saw 
that Africans brought over in the slave trade lost their families, their 
language, even their names, and their descendants were taught a history defined 
by white Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Pan-African studies today is still trying to present a counterpoint to that 
history, Dennis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's faculty continues to argue for more autonomy and acceptance, 
both within and without academia. 
</P>
<P>
 Among its supporters, the philosophy of 1969 remains strong: "If you don't 
know where you came from," said Broadous, echoing an old slogan, "you don't 
know where you are going." JILL LEOVY

 * IDA KENNEY / 'Drugs Are Our Worst Enemy' 
</P>
<P>
 Ida Kenney, 86, is a member of the Pacoima Over 50 Seniors Club and one of the 
founding members of the Greater Community Missionary Baptist Church -- the 
first African American church in the San Fernando Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 "The drugs are our worst enemy because the young people are destroying their 
lives and they won't be able to participate in society. These young people are 
involved in dope and they destroy their minds. Then all they want to do is rob 
and steal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tearing up our community and the country. It's always worse in our 
community because the government won't put one penny out here for these black 
boys. They want them in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main cause of our youngsters being so low in morale is that the majority 
of black males are in jail. They don't have any other choice. They don't have 
any other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been to church at night in four years. And there are a lot of other 
places I'd like to go at night. But I can't go. I'm not safe because of crime 
and dope. It's prevented me from enjoying my life as a senior citizen. Our 
dreams are smashed because of the system of allowing dope and crime to run the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any ordinary person could run this state better than it's being run. Instead 
of building more jails, we should make great big farms and let these boys learn 
to raise tomatoes and all kinds of fruits. Let them learn how to do something 
rather than watch TV and study how to be stronger gangsters."

 * This page of voices from the San Fernando Valley's African American 
community was developed and researched by Times special correspondents Susan 
Byrnes and Kurt Pitzer. The interviews were conducted by special correspondents 
Byrnes, Kay Hwangbo, Geoffrey Mohan, Pitzer and Jeannette Regalado. They 
interviewed several dozen people, and point out that while the voices do not 
represent all of the 73,851 African Americans who make up 4% of the Valley's 
population, the diversity of the ideas presented demonstrates a wide range of 
goals and hopes expressed.

 * WILLIAM T. BROADOUS / 'I Never Think It Is Too Late for Anybody' 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. William T. Broadous, 49, is pastor of Calvary Baptist Church in 
Pacoima. His father, the Rev. Hillery T. Broadous, founded Calvary Baptist in 
1955.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is the question of the quality of the education for people who have 
been incarcerated for years. What do they have when they come back to society? 
What kind of education do you have for them -- or is their only choice to be 
reincarcerated? 
</P>
<P>
 We should take some government money and develop a program, not just a 
Band-Aid program, but a workable one. Something that begins as they are 
incarcerated and continues in a community-based program when they come out. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, we should find out what is going on with them, their history 
while being incarcerated. We should look at their skills, education, goals, and 
then match them up with something they know they can do. 
</P>
<P>
 A community-based support group should be available where the person lives, so 
they won't get caught right back up with the same peer group. 
</P>
<P>
 Many young people from our community go in at 15 or 16, and come back out at 
20. They return to the same conditions that they left. But the community group 
can help guide them back into the mainstream of society. 
</P>
<P>
 I never think it is too late for anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of them genuinely want to do better. While in the system, they may make 
some definite decisions about changing their lives, but once they get out, 
there is nothing there to help them develop into the kind of person they want 
to be."

</P>
<P>
 Zuhairah Singh, 16, is a junior at Taft High School. She is vice president of 
the Young Black Scholars group on campus.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many negative images of African American people in the media. 
You barely ever see anyone doing anything good. The biggest issue is trying to 
get over the stereotype that we are all in gangs.  
</P>
<P>
 "I like a lot of different styles. I like to wear baggy pants and a T-shirt 
some days. But when I dress like that some people automatically think I'm a 
gangster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be able to wear hip-hop style clothes one day and the next day look 
really nice and casual. But people stereotype you. Basically people need to 
learn to get to know people before they judge them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am trying to prove that just because I dress like this doesn't mean that 
I'm a delinquent or a thug. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our group (Young Black Scholars) we encourage minorities to keep their 
grades up and motivate them to go to college. We are out there to set a good 
example. The only thing we can really do is do our best and tell our friends to 
do their best, whatever that is. We can start by showing people that all 
African Americans aren't thugs and gang members. A lot of us are trying to do 
something good."

 * TED MINOR / 'There Is No Central Focus' 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Minor, 72, is a retired sociology instructor at Mission College. He 
volunteers as a peer counselor at the Pacoima Multipurpose Center and 
elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing that needs to happen within the (African American) community 
is to pinpoint precisely what is the main goal or issue we need to talk about. 
There is no central focus. We're all so split in many different directions. As 
a group of people, I think, there's a lot of confusion about who we are and 
where we're going. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of that is there is still confusion as to our racial identity. In a way, 
we know less about who we are now than we ever did. Some of us are still trying 
to be Anglo-Saxons with Protestant ethics, working hard and going to the right 
schools, banking money and being successful by certain standards. Others of us 
are trying to be Africans. A lot of the African part involves being more 
socialistic and being a sharer. That doesn't always make us good business 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 1960s, I tried to purge myself of Western values and would say that I 
was an African person. But I wound up becoming like a schizophrenic, a dual 
person. I'm old enough now that I've risen above that, and I just call myself a 
human being. I'm at peace with myself, but I know there are many others who 
have not achieved that."

<P>
 From the African American who owned much of what is now the San Fernando 
Valley in the 1790s to the high school student who has devoted himself to 
keeping his peers out of gangs, people of African descent in the Valley have a 
long, proud history.  
</P>
<P>
 In this special report, we look back at some of that history and -- with the 
help of several voices from the present -- turn to the future.

 * RAY JACKSON / 'We Are Not Being Taken Seriously' 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Jackson, 62, is president of the Northeast Community Improvement Assn., 
comprising about 400 households in the northeast section of Pacoima.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you the truth, when it comes down to minorities in the Valley, 
there are so many related problems that are being overlooked by the 
authorities. I feel we have terrific problems over here with the maintenance of 
streets, that have not been improved since 1961, when we had the last major 
street project here. Then we have housing problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jobs, I imagine everyone will holler jobs, but I would say street 
improvements and police protection. If there's an emergency and you call 911, 
you'll eventually see police here. Not right away, but eventually. As for 
regular patrols, you don't see a lot of that here. . . . What we need is a 
general patrol of this area, like in any area, a car coming through -- and 
street repairs. I know most blacks, (jobs) will be the first thing they'll hit 
you with, and I think jobs are a high priority, but I think the NAACP should be 
working on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are being ignored. We are being overlooked. We are not being taken 
seriously. Except when it comes down to time for the ballot box. . . . We are 
still here waiting for something to happen. I guess we'll be waiting until the 
moon turns blue. What we need is street improvements, police patrols and for 
the citizens to get up off their rear. . . . What most people don't understand 
is when you improve and bring up your area, everyone is affected. I think a lot 
of whites don't understand that. They think if we improve, they lose."

 * DWAN SMITH-FORTIER / 'Arts Help Us to Understand Another' 
</P>
<P>
 Dwan Smith-Fortier, 47, of Sylmar is a writer, director and producer. She is a 
board member of the Boys & Girls Club of San Fernando, and a member of the 
National Council of Negro Women.  
</P>
<P>
 "My particular interest is the arts, not so much from a show business 
standpoint, but from being able to teach people, children particularly, how to 
communicate, how to say and show what you feel. When the riots happened, (I was 
asked) if I would write something to explain to children the events of the 
riots, to help them understand and become calm. Our children go to 
multicultural schools, and we didn't want them within their classes and school 
to turn on one another. I came up with a play called 'Windows . . . Mama, why 
is L.A. burning?' 
</P>
<P>
 "There were four family groups -- African American, Latino, Korean and Anglo 
-- on stage at the same time. They were sitting on separate stages, and it was 
representative of their home and their neighborhood. And there was a window on 
the front of each one of their homes, and these windows were pointed to the 
center stage, which represented the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through 'Windows,' we were able to see through each other's windows and see 
how other people felt. See how they lived, see why they felt as they felt -- 
which uses the arts to help us to understand one another."

 * C. JESSEL STRONG / 'Let's View Melting Pot in Its Reality' 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. C. Jessel Strong, 51, is pastor of Parks Chapel African Methodist 
Episcopal Church in Pacoima. He is active in the San Fernando Valley Red Cross, 
the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People and the Black American 
Political Assn. of California. Strong came to Parks Chapel from the church he 
founded in Valinda, Calif., to help build the Pacoima congregation's social and 
educational programs.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are now discovering that black Americans have made many contributions to 
building this country. It is important that young people know about this in 
order to build their self-esteem. It gives them a feeling of pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our history books we only learn about George Washington Carver and a few 
others. But when young people are taught that our people have been an integral 
part of our culture, it does so much good. 
</P>
<P>
 "The media distorts everything. If you watch television, you'd think all we do 
is steal or that we are all comedians, but some of us have doctoral degrees. We 
are no different than any other people. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a small way, Black History Month helps but we need to continue throughout 
the year. Not only for black Americans but other races as well. Let's view this 
melting pot in its reality -- that people of all races have contributed and 
have made it what it is today."

 * LEROY ADAMS / 'I Think the Employers Need to Be Colorblind' 
</P>
<P>
 Leroy Adams, 50, is a Realtor and former president of the Pacoima Chamber of 
Commerce.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the most important thing to address would be employment opportunities 
for the younger people and access to higher education. As the cost of higher 
education keeps increasing, it becomes harder and harder for people who don't 
have the financial reserves to go to school. Also, a disproportionate number of 
African Americans are unemployed. It's very hard to maintain your dignity and 
try to have access to the decent things in society when you don't have a job. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me that, at the businesses, the restaurants, hardware stores and 
other places I patronize, a disproportionate number of employees are not 
African American. My own son, who is attending college, spent months looking 
for a job before he got a position in retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not suggesting that people are consciously trying to not employ the 
African American or doing anything illegal, but there may be a tendency to be 
more comfortable, for whatever reason, hiring someone else. I think the 
employers need to be colorblind in their hiring and reject stereotyped images 
in the media, which seem to depict African Americans as involved in crime or 
panhandling on a regular basis. There are a lot of young African Americans out 
there who want to work hard and deserve a chance."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY HALL MAY CLOSE ON ALTERNATING FRIDAYS; 
GOVERNMENT: PROPONENTS SAY PLAN IS MORE EFFICIENT THAN OPERATING WITH HALF THE 
REGULAR STAFF ON MONDAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supporters of a proposed new city work schedule say City Hall would run more 
efficiently if it were closed every other Friday rather than operating with 
half the regular staff on Mondays. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the City Council tonight, the new routine would close city 
offices on alternating Fridays and operate on other days between 7:30 a.m. and 
5:30 p.m. It would take effect in late March or early April. Currently, half 
the staff is off every other Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Modified work schedules are part of Santa Clarita's efforts to meet South 
Coast Air Quality Management District standards. The AQMD requires businesses 
with 100 or more employees to reduce the number of car trips to work by 
encouraging car pooling, public transportation or bicycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita has about 185 full-time employees and has given its workers 
every other Monday off since January, 1992. The modified schedules have 
employees working 80 hours over nine days rather than 10, thereby reducing the 
number of trips to and from their offices. Schedules were staggered so each 
department was half-staffed those days, theoretically allowing employees to 
cover for one another. 
</P>
<P>
 About 55 to 60 vehicle trips are believed to have been avoided weekly with the 
altered workweek, and an additional 20 to 25 trips were saved through 
car-pooling and other incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the program succeeded in its efforts to help with air quality, city 
department heads say it's been a problem for residents trying to contact city 
employees, has slowed productivity as employees cover for missing workers, and 
has limited when staff meetings can be scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frequently, whenever a member of the public calls or comes in to City Hall 
for certain services on . . . Monday, they find that the person or persons they 
need to see are not available," said Ken Pulskamp, assistant city manager, in a 
written report to the council. "It is both difficult and confusing to explain 
to the public that staff works an 80-hour period while the appearance under our 
current system is that they are frequently missing from their posts." 
</P>
<P>
 Department heads believe the new schedule will accomplish the same results 
without the problems. City employees would not receive additional time off 
under the new routine. 
</P>
<P>
 The move would also coordinate city schedules with Los Angeles County Public 
Works, Regional Planning and other offices that are closed every Friday.

 Sheriff's deputies arrested three men and one teen-ager Monday for last week's 
slaying of a jewelry store employee, who was shot in the upper chest during a 
robbery, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested were Tyrran Delvon Wilson, 20; Walter Lenard Johnson, 19; Antonio Lee 
Roberts, 20; and a 16-year-old boy; all from Palmdale, according to Deputy 
Larry Mead of the Sheriff's Headquarters Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, deputies responded to a 911 call at 1:11 p.m. from a passerby who 
looked into Charles Jewelers at 38513 Sierra Hwy. and saw smashed display 
cases.  
</P>
<P>
 When authorities arrived, they found 45-year-old Sung Heeh Hwang lying on the 
floor, Mead said. Hwang had been working alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have not released an estimated value of the jewelry taken during 
the robbery. ABIGAIL GOLDMAN

BLACK HISTORY MONTH / VALLEY RETROSPECTIVE; PERSPECTIVES ON THE PAST -- AND THE

<P>
 From the African American who owned much of what is now the San Fernando 
Valley in the 1790s to the high school student who has devoted himself to 
keeping his peers out of gangs, people of African descent in the Valley have a 
long, proud history.  
</P>
<P>
 In this special report, we look back at some of that history and -- with the 
help of several voices from the present -- turn to the future. 
</P>
<P>
 * SAN FERNANDO / Past Is Rich but Difficult to Uncover 
</P>
<P>
 When the students at San Fernando High School glance at the hallway displays 
this month, they will see some familiar faces -- Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., 
Malcolm X and other African Americans of national fame. 
</P>
<P>
 But they won't see the face of Nancy Avery, Pacoima's postmaster from 1961 to 
1984 and the first African American to head a major post office. They won't see 
Fernando Reyes, a biracial mayor of Los Angeles who in the 1790s owned much of 
what is now the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the history of people of African descent in the Valley is a long one, 
it's not well-known or easily accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley Historical Society's files include 11 newspaper 
clippings under the heading "Pacoima-Ethnic Groups." Volunteers can find only a 
handful of articles relating to African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Itibari Zulu, librarian for UCLA's Center for Afro-American Studies, said he 
knew of no history compilation about African Americans in the Valley. "I don't 
think anybody has written anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The history is there for those willing to search, however. From brothers Pio 
and Andres Pico -- who were of Mexican and African descent -- to the Cal State 
Northridge students who took over the campus in 1968 to demand an Afro-American 
studies department, there is history. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to really go and look it up but it's there," said William Huling, a 
retired sociology professor who taught Pan African studies and sociology at 
CSUN. "There's a huge history of blacks in the Valley that's unknown." 
</P>
<P>
 Huling discovered some of that history researching a 1978 dissertation titled 
"Aging Blacks in Suburbia." 
</P>
<P>
 "I found it fascinating," Huling said. "It really opened my eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Huling donated his recorded interviews with African American community leaders 
-- including Avery, the Rev. Hillery T. Broadous and the Rev. T. G. Pledger -- 
to the CSUN library, where he hopes they will inspire other scholars to follow 
his lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many others that need to be included," he said. Perhaps the 
single deepest source of historical material -- the collection of a former 
bookstore owner and community volunteer -- may find its way into a small 
library. The Pacoima Chamber of Commerce hopes to use material amassed by 
82-year-old Pauline Jenkins -- including minutes of meetings dating to the 
1950s -- to chronicle the history of Pacoima, one of the few places where 
blacks were encouraged to settle in the Valley after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Harris, a 32-year Pacoima resident and former honorary mayor of the 
community, tried to revive interest in Pacoima and its history with the "Back 
to Pacoima Expo," but it faded in 1987 after seven years, because of the 
project's expense. 
</P>
<P>
 The community itself, she said, should take responsibility for preserving its 
heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most of the blame lies with the Afro-American community for not 
having honored the people who were trailblazers in our community," Harris said. 
"Some of the history that did not get out was because we didn't put it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, some African Americans fear they will lose touch with even more of their 
past as they begin to make up smaller percentages of the populations of old 
enclaves like Pacoima and Arleta, where African Americans make up only 9% of 
the communities, according to the 1990 census, compared to 17% in 1980.

history." REBECCA BRYANT

 From the African American who owned much of what is now the San Fernando 
Valley in the 1790s to the high school student who has devoted himself to 
keeping his peers out of gangs, people of African descent in the Valley have a 
long, proud history.  
</P>
<P>
 In this special report, we look back at some of that history and -- with the 
help of several voices from the present -- turn to the future.

 * BARBARA PERKINS /'Work Together for the Greater Good' 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Perkins, 35, is president of San Fernando Valley Section of the 
National Council of Negro Women and mother of two young children.  
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that is really important is bridge-building among and 
within the African American community. There seems to be a lack of cohesiveness 
in the community that has to do with the way we are located geographically -- 
we don't seem to have a master networking system. The geography is such that we 
don't represent a large piece of the population. It's crucial that the people 
in leadership positions like the clergy and social service organizations work 
together for the greater good. We don't have the luxury of working together in 
pockets. I think we got caught up in the 'me' society and it's sometimes easier 
to take care of your own group, your own self, your own church. 
</P>
<P>
 "The legacy of Mary McLeod Bethune (founder of National Council of Negro 
Women) was to build an organization of other organizations -- a catalyst 
organization that brings people together to the table. 
</P>
<P>
 We need to reshape how we think about our own particular groups and look 
broader -- as an entire community. It is our responsibility to look beyond and 
see the community as one."

 * SEAN D. HENRY / 'People Should Go to Churches' 
</P>
<P>
 Sean D. Henry, 16, of San Fernando is a sophomore at Grover Cleveland High 
School in Reseda. He is president of the youth choir at the Greater Community 
Missionary Baptist Church in Pacoima and a volunteer for the Pacoima Community 
Youth Culture Center.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have friends who are hard-core gang members. I try not to live that way. I 
try to do something for my community rather than hurting it by killing innocent 
people. I started volunteering after seeing what other people did. It seemed to 
bring more of a happiness to the community when people did something positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "People should be active in their churches. More people should go to churches, 
period. It's a more positive thing to do. You can also work with your community 
center or Boys & Girls Club or volunteer time for something useful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I volunteer at the Pacoima community youth center. I answer telephones and 
pass out flyers when something is happening at the Boys & Girls Club. During 
their campaigns, I was helping different congressmen and Assembly candidates to 
run. I would introduce them and I would pass out flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world needs something positive. We have the drugs and we have the peer 
pressure -- we need something more uplifting. We need to see somebody actually 
doing something. If you actually see somebody doing something you want to do, 
join in and help them."

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; CSUN COPING WITH ITS LOSSES

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake destroyed or damaged dozens of key buildings 
at the sprawling Cal State Northridge campus, forcing students to attend 
classes in temporary bungalows. 
</P>
<P>
 The 353-acre campus, which reopened on Feb. 14, sustained an estimated $350 
million in damage in the 6.8-magnitude temblor, believed to be the worst 
natural disaster ever to befall a U. S. college campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Students are unable to use the heavily damaged Oviatt Library and are shuttled 
to the UCLA library, an hour's ride away. The 220,000-square-foot structure 
dropped most of its 600,000 volumes from the shelves and suffered damage to 
about 15 boxes of rare books in last week's rains. University officials hope to 
reopen the library by mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of the 2,500-space parking structure has caused students to fight for 
parking in neighborhoods adjacent to the university. Waits for parking spots 
sometimes approach 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 About 24,500 students have registered for the spring semester, which will not 
offer a spring break and will be extended a week to make up for the delay in 
opening caused by the quake. CHIP JOHNSON

TRYING TO SOLVE PROBLEM OF DANGEROUS WASTES; INDUSTRY: UC IRVINE, OTHER GROUPS 
HAVE LAUNCHED AD CAMPAIGN URGING APPROVAL OF CONTROVERSIAL DISPOSAL FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Every day, students and researchers step into UC Irvine's science laboratories 
to stretch their minds and their creative limits as they seek to help solve 
mankind's ills. 
</P>
<P>
 Their successes are helping create a strong biotechnology industry in Orange 
County, but their dross -- low-level radioactive waste left when their 
experiments are completed -- is stored in 55-gallon drums and stacked in a 
trailer parked on the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past year, the university has been storing its own radioactive waste 
because, like all other such radioactive waste producers in California, it does 
not have a place to dump it safely and legally. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going anywhere," lamented Jim Tripodef, UCI's associate director of 
environmental health and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 To solve that dilemma, UCI and a group of other organizations have launched an 
advertising campaign urging the federal government to speed up approval of the 
controversial Ward Valley project, a radioactive waste disposal facility 
proposed for construction in the eastern Mojave Desert near Needles. 
</P>
<P>
 The dump's approval is on indefinite hold while the courts rule on 
environmental safety issues and a spate of lawsuits challenging the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition of dump proponents, whose members include the Orange County 
Biomedical Industry Council and Southern California Edison, said in its latest 
advertisement -- printed in local newspapers last week -- that if the Ward 
Valley project is not approved, California's beleaguered economy could 
experience a further loss of as many as 200,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "California Has Lost More Than 800,000 Jobs in the Past Five Years," the 
advertisement states. "Are We Trying for a Million?" 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition also charged that unless the dump is approved, the state's 
growing biotechnology industry will be hampered severely and the nation will 
suffer from a resultant slowdown in new medical discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very important issue," said Daniel Korpolinski, president of the 
biomedical council and chief executive officer of CoCensys Inc., an Irvine firm 
that is studying new drugs to cure certain brain-related diseases. "We can't go 
on without a place to put this waste." 
</P>
<P>
 Korpolinski's company is not alone. From Fullerton to San Clemente, Orange 
County health care companies involved in discovering new drugs and procedures 
are stymied about where to put the radioactive waste, a necessary byproduct of 
the research and development process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been accumulating this stuff for some time," said Mike Timmermann, a 
spokesman at Allergan Inc., the Irvine maker of eye- and skin-care products. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan A. Steigart, president of Cortex Pharmaceuticals Inc., which is 
developing drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease, added that if California wants 
to pull itself out of the recession for good, it should create a friendly 
environment for businesses -- like the biotech industry -- that promise to grow 
the fastest in the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state can't have it both ways," he said. "You can't invite industry here 
and then stifle it." 
</P>
<P>
 But local activists insist that Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt made the 
correct decision in November when he put a stop to a land transfer that would 
have made the Ward Valley dump a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt ruled that transfer of the property to U.S. Ecology Inc., the Kentucky 
firm that would build and manage the dump, should not proceed until several 
environmental lawsuits filed by Ward Valley opponents are settled -- a process 
that could take years. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay is justified, dump opponents said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This affects the entire public's health," said Marion Sack, executive 
director of Santa Ana-based Alliance for Survival. She added that the dump 
would be a final resting place not only for low-level radioactive waste 
produced by medical facilities but also for radioactive waste from nuclear 
power plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Babbitt's decision was wisely made," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sack said her group also opposes the dump because plans call for building it 
without expensive liners to prevent radioactive waste from leeching into 
underground water sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed dump would be near the Colorado River, Sack said, and could 
possibly pollute one of Southern California's major water sources. 
</P>
<P>
 She also blasted the coalition's advertising campaign, noting that her group 
does not have the funds to match the pro-Ward Valley organizations' publicity 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can bet those are expensive ads," Sack said. "There is no way we can 
possibly compete with that kind of exposure and that kind of money." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ward Valley proponents say that the dump's opponents, backed by U.S. Sen. 
Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), have been making themselves heard. 
</P>
<P>
 In a passage that alluded to Boxer's presence among the ranks of Ward Valley 
foes, last week's advertisement charged that Babbitt was "bowing to pressure by 
special interest groups and certain politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 Biomedical council president Korpolinski charged that Boxer has exaggerated 
the dangers of the disposal site, threatening the future of the biotechnology 
industry, which "promises to be the biggest creator of jobs in the 1990s."

TRYING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS OF DANGEROUS WASTES; SEEKING SOLUTIONS TO WHAT TO DO 
WITH WASTE; FIRM: O.C.-BASED HAZARDOUS MATERIALS HAULER SECURITY ENVIRONMENTAL 
SYSTEMS IS GROWING FAST AMID RAPID CHANGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One morning last week, Ellen L. Batzel was poking around a truck yard in the 
industrial enclave of Vernon in her blue jeans, work shirt and cowboy boots. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of hours later, the corporate lawyer-turned-prospective president of 
Security Environmental Systems was back in a navy, pin-stripe suit at the 
headquarters in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 It's that kind of company, she explained. Just about every executive of the 
company has, at one time or another, driven a truck. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company may have a hard time staying that way. The family-run business 
has nationwide ambitions and is growing at a fast clip amid rapid change. 
</P>
<P>
 Only last year, Security Environmental still derived almost half its revenue 
from disposing of medical waste. In a bold move, it sold the medical-waste 
business to its chief rival in order to concentrate on hauling hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the company says it has received several lucrative federal contracts to 
clean up hazardous waste at 26 military bases around the country, and is doing 
periodic work for as many as 500 private companies as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Batzel, the company's outside legal counsel until November, is slated to 
become president in a proposed management shake-up that goes before the board 
of directors on March 1. That will make her the first person unrelated to 
founder Alfred Grossman to hold such a key title. 
</P>
<P>
 Batzel, 42, plans to use her corporate savvy to impress Wall Street and to 
engineer the kinds of mergers and acquisitions that the company will need in 
order to grow. Although traded on Nasdaq, the company is about 40% held by the 
Grossman family and has not attracted the attention of institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
 It has stayed profitable, however. The company reported last week that it 
earned profits of $163,895, or 5 cents a share, in the second quarter ended 
Dec. 31, down from $1.1 million, or 32 cents a share, for the same quarter in 
the previous year. The decline resulted from completion of a large, onetime job 
of removing contaminated soil at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had $3 million in cash and a measly $57,000 in long-term debt as 
of January. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a remarkably clean balance sheet for a company that has made radical 
changes in directions to look for opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Security Environmental was hatched in 1972, when Alfred Grossman bought an 
incinerator in Garden Grove on the notion that other firms would want to 
contract for the destruction of sensitive documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are literally dozens of types of materials that have to be destroyed, 
but which are too valuable to be entrusted to the trash man," Grossman said in 
an interview a year later with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 When the idea failed to catch on, Grossman found a new use for his 
incinerators: consuming the thousands of pounds of medical waste generated by 
local hospitals. The business did so well that Grossman planned an expansion to 
build the state's first full-scale, commercial incinerator for hazardous waste 
in Vernon, an industrial town just east of central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Security Environmental spent $4 million on the venture and won more than 50 
permits needed to start construction. But the project became hotly contested by 
nearby neighborhoods who feared emissions might cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Security Environmental reluctantly killed the project. In the 
process, however, it had discovered a whole new business. Gearing up to build 
its incinerator, the company had gained expertise in hazardous waste trucking 
and disposal, the vast majority of which involved wastes no more hazardous than 
car wash cleaner residue and the sludge left over from making ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 And the business generated higher profit margins than medical waste. 
</P>
<P>
 To pursue those margins, Security Environmental decided last year to surrender 
its medical waste business to competitor Browning-Ferris Industries by selling 
its customer list in return for assumption of $300,000 in outstanding debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Free to concentrate on hazardous waste hauling, Security Environmental found a 
lucrative new customer in the U.S. Defense Department. With base closures, the 
military is more concerned than ever about cleaning up hazardous wastes on its 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The company started with the Camp Pendleton contract and has secured four more 
since. Batzel said she plans to relocate to Asheville, N.C., so she can direct 
efforts to service those contracts and reach new customers. Pretty soon, 
Security Environmental -- and its 40 field workers -- will have the Southwest 
and Midwest covered as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Security Environmental has also serviced maquiladoras on the Mexican border. 
The North American Free Trade Agreement, Batzel said, could bring more waste 
hauling business because of side agreements that require a cleaner environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we apply our methods of business to more niche markets, we'll just clean 
up," Batzel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman couldn't be more pleased. At 72 and chairman emeritus, he still shows 
up at the company's headquarters every workday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the next step in our growth," he said. "We must do that or we'll fade 
into the sunset."

CHAIRMAN OF FLUOR TO UNDERGO SURGERY FOR PROSTATE CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN CHRISTIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Les McCraw, chairman and chief executive officer of Fluor Corp. in Irvine, has 
been diagnosed with prostate cancer, the company announced Monday. He will 
undergo surgery March 2 to remove a malignant tumor from the gland. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor spokeswoman Kirsten Frosh described the tumor as small and contained. 
"It was caught in the very early stages of development," she said. McCraw is 
expected to return to work two weeks after the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 McCraw, 59, was named CEO of Fluor in 1990, and assumed the additional title 
of chairman the next year. He has worked for the engineering and construction 
giant since 1975. After suffering a string of losses in the early and 
mid-1980s, Fluor posted record revenue of $7.9 billion for 1993, with earnings 
of $166.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Cancer of the prostate gland is one of the most common cancers among men. It 
is considered highly treatable if detected before spreading to nearby lymph 
nodes. 
</P>
<P>
 Frosh said that Fluor's annual meeting of shareholders will take place as 
scheduled on March 8. Vincent Kontny, president and chief operating officer of 
Fluor, will preside over the meeting. McCraw "will remain accessible" while 
recuperating from surgery, Frosh said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCraw and his wife, Mary Earle, reside in Newport Beach. They have three 
sons.

FORECLOSURES UP NEARLY 73% BUT RATE SLOWS; HOUSING: PREVIOUS RATES WERE 96% IN 
1992, 165% IN 1991. LAGUNA HILLS HAD LARGEST PERCENTAGE INCREASE, FOLLOWED BY 
TUSTIN. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of foreclosures on Orange County homes and business properties 
jumped nearly 73% last year as the local housing market continued to struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 figures from TRW Redi Property Data, a real estate research company 
based in Riverside, included a positive note, though: Local foreclosures rose 
at a slower rate than in 1992, which saw an increase of 96%, and in 1991, which 
had a whopping 165% rise. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual number of local foreclosures has increased each year since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that the rate of increase has slowed is a signal that we've got less 
of a problem," said Nima Nattagh, an analyst with TRW in Costa Mesa. "But 
obviously, foreclosures are still going up, and this will put pressure on home 
prices." 
</P>
<P>
 Nattagh noted that foreclosure numbers are a lagging indicator, typically 
highlighting the difficulties that property owners were having six months 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County had 5,375 foreclosures in 1993, compared to 3,109 in 1992. More 
than 85% of last year's foreclosures were residential properties, TRW figures 
showed. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills, with 178 foreclosures reported, had the largest percentage 
increase. The previous year, the area had only 82 foreclosures. Tustin has the 
second-highest rate of increase, with 176 foreclosures in 1993, compared to 82 
for 1992, TRW said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think Laguna Hills and Tustin both had rapid development during the past 
six years, so there is a greater number of people there who bought at the 
height of the market, stretching themselves too thin," Nattagh said. 
</P>

BRIEFCASE: HEALTH CARE; I-FLOW'S IV PUMP BUSINESS STREAMING INTO MARKETS IN 
JAPAN AND ACROSS EUROPE 
</P>

<P>
 I-Flow Corp. is all pumped up about its international sales opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine maker of intravenous pumps for use in hospitals and homes said it 
has signed deals with companies in Japan and Europe to sell its products 
overseas. The three-year contracts, negotiated separately but finalized at the 
same time, are worth more than $3 million in total revenue. That works out to 
about $1 million a year -- a 50% boost for the small 3-year-old company, which 
had revenue of $1.9 million for its latest fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 One agreement is with the giant Japanese drug firm Kobayashi Pharmaceuticals, 
whose division, Kobayashi Medical, will distribute I-Flow's Paragon, a 
spring-loaded pump that can be used by patients while allowing them to walk, 
work or drive. 
</P>
<P>
 It will later distribute I-Flow's SideKick pump, which was designed for 
home-care use. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're excited about the contract," said president Don Earhart, adding that it 
marks the firm's first foray into Japan. "This will be really good for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The other contract allows Spruyt-Hillen BV in The Netherlands to distribute 
the Paragon and SideKick pumps to Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
 I-Flow already sells its products in Italy and Ireland and is currently 
seeking health ministry approval for sale of the devices to Germany and France. 
</P>
<P>
 Earhart said that he expects the first shipments to be made in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But as happy as the news is for I-Flow, Earhart said that company officials 
are a little stymied over the names of its products. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that the Paragon pump can not be distributed in Japan under that name 
because another company already uses that name for a similar product. Kobayashi 
will soon choose another name for sales there. 
</P>
<P>
 And Spruyt-Hillen will change the name of the SideKick for distribution in the 
Benelux. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because it has the connotation of being related to a druggie," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, something must have gotten lost in the translation.

 Bare Bones: Are you suffering from an overpowering desire to know just how 
human bones are formed? 
</P>
<P>
 If so, then ICN Biomedicals, a subsidiary of ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., has 
just the chemical for you. 
</P>
<P>
 ICN Biomedicals said it is now selling tubulin, a protein that is a necessary 
component in cell structure and the formation of new cells. 
</P>
<P>
 So far so good. 
</P>
<P>
 But more importantly, ICN Biomedicals officials said, it is also a component 
of the human body that promotes bone, cartilage and connective tissue growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Tubulin will be sold by laboratories involved in trying to discover how those 
bodily systems work -- or rather don't work. By understanding how bones and 
other parts of the body work properly, researchers hope to ultimately 
understand how they become cancerous.

 Breathing Easier: A pair of former Orange County hospital executives have 
decided to go it alone to market a new laser surgery procedure that can ease 
problems associated with lung disease in smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 John Kramer and Linda Simons, both of whom recently worked at Chapman General 
Hospital in Orange, started U.S. Lung Centers of Yorba Linda.The firm will be 
promoting a surgical technique called thoracoscopic laser bullectomy. The 
procedure, performed after a tiny incision is made in the chest, is used to 
treat bullous emphysema, a disease in which air cysts are formed in the lungs, 
impeding breathing. The condition is acute in smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm has already garnered a contract with doctors at Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana. U.S. Lung Centers will manage the hospital's lung center and 
market the procedure to the community. Terms of the contract were not 
disclosed.

EFFORTS OF ENTREPRENEUR MAKE SUN HEALTHCARE SHINE; HEALTH CARE: NURSING HOME 
CHAIN GREW OUT OF FOUNDER'S DESIRE TO SPEND MORE TIME AT HOME. THE $350-MILLION 
BUSINESS COULD MORE THAN DOUBLE IN SIZE WITH PLANNED ACQUISITION OF COMPETITOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Andy Turner wanted sun and a slower pace when he left his executive job at a 
big nursing home chain based in Washington state and moved to New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 He got the sun. The slower pace didn't last. 
</P>
<P>
 The small nursing home company he started in the basement of his Albuquerque 
home in 1989 became Sun Healthcare Group Inc., a $350-million business that 
could more than double in size with the planned acquisition of Mediplex Group, 
a Boston-based competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger, signed last month by the boards of both companies, would give Sun 
120 health care facilities in 20 states employing 13,000 people and generating 
$800 million in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 That will make Sun Healthcare one of the biggest national chains of nursing 
homes, a fast-growing area of the health care industry that is likely to grow 
even more as the baby boom generation ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun is still far smaller than the industry leader Beverly Enterprises, a Fort 
Smith, Ark.-based chain of 900 homes. But under Turner's guidance, Sun already 
has outgrown a $5.5-million, 42,000-square-foot corporate headquarters under 
construction here and isn't slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made the decision to go ahead and go for it," Turner said. "It would be 
conservative to say we could double in size again in five years." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, 47, said he still finds it ironic that the company grew out of his 
desire to step back and spend more time at home. 
</P>
<P>
 He had spent 15 years in the nursing home industry, from running a nursing 
home to working as an operations officer for two big chains. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was traveling all the time," he said. "I was responsible for the day-to-day 
things that went on in the nursing homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner was chief of operations at Tacoma, Wash.-based Hillhaven Corp. -- the 
nation's second-largest nursing home chain -- in 1987 when he and two other 
executives decided to start their own company, Horizon Healthcare, in 
Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted sunshine," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also wanted autonomy, less travel and a slower pace. 
</P>
<P>
 But the trappings of success followed. By May, 1987, Horizon owned 67 nursing 
homes and was selling stock to the public for further expansion. Again, Turner 
confronted the conflict of work vs. personal life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Horizon was growing so fast that my time away from home was the same," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Horizon wanted to sell seven unprofitable nursing homes -- three in Washington 
and four in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner bought them, left Horizon and, on Jan. 1, 1989, founded Sunrise 
Healthcare. The name came to him one morning as he watched the sun rise from 
his kitchen window. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wound up with a little bitty company with seven homes, based in New Mexico, 
and I could slow down," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pace lasted a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, as Sunrise began buying more nursing homes, Turner and his wife, 
Nora, an occupational therapist, started a second company -- Sundance 
Rehabilitation Corp. Sundance provides physical, occupational and speech 
therapists to nursing homes that contract with the company to run their 
rehabilitation programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sundance is now the third-largest employer of therapists in the country, with 
800 in 21 major cities, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1993, Sunrise had 25 nursing homes, Sundance was 2 years old, and 
Turner decided to get into the institutional pharmacy business, providing 
prescription drugs to nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunscript Pharmacy Corp. was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunscript has pharmacies in Chicago, Seattle, Hartford, Conn., Phoenix and 
Tucson, and plans to open five more in 1994. Sunscript had $20 million in sales 
in 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner was approached by Wall Street investors about going public last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a big decision," he said. "Would we be a family-owned smaller 
business or take the giant step of being a publicly held big company with 
obligations?" 
</P>
<P>
 Turner took the giant step. 
</P>
<P>
 He combined Sunrise, Sundance and Sunscript under the Sun Healthcare umbrella. 
In a public offering last July, he sold 40% of the company to investors in the 
United States and Europe, raising $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The money was used to expand the company. Sunrise bought 42 nursing homes, 
including the Oklahoma City-based Honorcare chain of 14 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth company was started, Sunquest Consulting Inc., which provides 
Medicare consultation services to nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun's biggest coup has been the Mediplex acquisition for about $312 million in 
cash and stock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here was a little New Mexico company buying a big East Coast company," Turner 
said. "The crown jewel was snapped up by a backwater businessman." 
</P>
<P>
 With projected 1993 revenue of more than $400 million, Mediplex is a major 
provider of so-called subacute care for patients who are too sick to go home 
but no longer need the intensive services provided by a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition places Sun among health care providers who could offer the 
comprehensive delivery systems that are part of the Clinton administration's 
proposed reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "This really brings them into the forefront of the (subacute care) industry," 
said Todd Richter, an industry analyst with the Dean Witter-Discover brokerage 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm surprised," Turner said of Sun's growth. "I was working out of the 
basement and going upstairs for a sandwich, and five years later it's an 
$800-million concern -- that's a big change." 
</P>
<P>
 He attributed the company's success to a respect for nursing home patients 
that has generated a culture of putting their needs ahead of profitability. In 
the world of nursing home care, which has a documented history of provider 
abuse, sensitivity to patients and their families is a critical attribute. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must have an unbending commitment to doing a first-class job of tending 
to the frail elderly," Turner said. "If you do well, you will be rewarded 
financially."

NEWS ANALYSIS; SOME OFFICIALS DOUBT U.S. HAS GAME PLAN FOR JAPAN; TRADE: OTHERS 
SAY STRATEGY IS SECRET TO KEEP TOKYO OFF BALANCE. EFFECT ON OTHER ASIAN ISSUES 
IS A CONCERN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Despite President Clinton's tough talk about Japan's trade policy, the 
Administration appears to lack both a grand strategy and a day-by-day game plan 
for prying open Japan's markets, according to government sources and trade 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the unsuccessful talks Feb. 11 between Clinton and 
Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, a senior U.S. official admitted 
privately a week later, "We've been trying to figure out what to do next." 
</P>
<P>
 There is agreement within the Administration on the need to confront Japan but 
uncertainty over how to do it and whether the get-tough approach will have the 
desired effect, senior Administration trade and economic officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe it or not," a senior U.S. official said, "we didn't think through in 
advance what we would do" if the summit meeting failed to find common ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating matters are concerns within the Administration that any display 
of disunity will send misleading signals to Asia, where the United States is 
engaged on such sensitive military and political issues as opposition to the 
development of nuclear weapons in North Korea and insistence on respect for 
human rights in China. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Administration officials insist that they do indeed have a carefully 
mapped strategy but are keeping it secret to put the Japanese off balance. They 
promise to begin unveiling a series of steps soon -- possibly as early as this 
week -- in their effort to keep the pressure on Japan to reduce its 
$60-billion-a-year trade surplus with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goals are clear, the strategy is clear and the tactics have been 
consistent," U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said in an interview. "I 
don't think there is any doubt about what the Administration wants to 
accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 "For three weeks we have had a menu of options. They have been thoroughly 
reviewed and precisely calculated as to what they might mean to our economy and 
to the Japanese economy. And when we make our decisions, they'll be done on a 
rational, calculated basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Another senior official deeply involved in the on-again, off-again 
negotiations in Washington and Tokyo said: "Is there a strategy? Of course 
there is. What you cannot quantify is how long it will take. We are doing 
everything we can to make sure things don't happen by accident. We have a 
deliberate strategy. It's really delicate stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials and others familiar with these plans say they 
include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Renewing a provision in U.S. trade regulations to allow the government to 
cite the Japanese for following unfair trade practices, a step that could lead 
to U.S. retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Slowing auto imports with extensive dockside safety inspections, a 
harassment tool devised by Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 * Scaling back tax benefits given to Japanese auto manufacturers in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stepping up the use of U.S. laws prohibiting the "dumping" on U.S. markets 
of goods sold at less than the price in the home market. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an approach that is intended "to show we are serious rather than to 
achieve an immediate resolution of the dispute," said one economist who advises 
Clinton privately. "Certainly the President's and Mickey Kantor's views are 
pretty clear. They are very clear that they want to make Japan a more open 
economy. How to do that -- there's not an exact game plan." 
</P>
<P>
 And one former government trade expert who has advised Administration trade 
officials complained, "This is guerrilla warfare, but what you need is all-out 
conventional war." 
</P>
<P>
 "They are looking at a slow escalation of issues," said a source close to the 
Democratic congressional leadership who is generally sympathetic to the 
Administration's trade policies. "But they don't have a step-by-step plan. At 
some point they have to have an integrated strategy that takes account of 
day-to-day moves." 
</P>
<P>
 The complicated trade game, he said, is the equivalent of a three-dimensional 
chess game. So, he was asked, how many moves ahead has the Administration 
thought? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think many," said the congressional aide, who, like others who 
support the Administration's trade campaign and in many cases have helped 
prepare it, spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the Administration's uncertainty illustrates the same sort of 
failure of strategic planning that has plagued the Administration's diplomatic 
policy generally. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought the Japanese always cave in at the eleventh hour, and they had 
no strategy," said Carla Hills, Kantor's predecessor as U.S. trade 
representative in the George Bush Administration. "They're hung up on numbers, 
and it's a dead end." 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia University economist Jagdish Bhagwati, a former adviser to the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, blames the Administration for failing 
to recognize the scope of the political upheaval taking place in Japan. He also 
faults its refusal "to think through their position and come out with policies 
that make sense." 
</P>
<P>
 "The new Japan is trying to be like the old United States, and the new United 
States is trying to be like the old Japan," Bhagwati said. 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence, he pointed to Japan's move toward political openness and away 
from managed trade. Meanwhile, he said, the United States is insisting on 
arriving at "objective" benchmarks to measure its access to the Japanese 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the Administration and among trade experts, said Paula Stern, a former 
member of the International Trade Commission, a debate is continuing over the 
best course to follow: trying to open the Japanese market industry by industry, 
as in the past, or sending an unambiguous message that the Japanese economy 
must be thoroughly deregulated and restructured. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has largely chosen elements from both paths. It has called 
for major changes in Japan's way of doing business, echoing Hosokawa's 
political mandate when he led the rebellion against four decades of political 
rule by the Liberal Democratic Party. At the same time, it has concentrated its 
firepower on four sectors -- telecommunications, medical equipment, insurance, 
and automobiles and auto parts -- as the initial targets for foreign 
penetration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important in this transitional period that the Clinton Administration 
give a clear-cut signal we won't be satisfied with a bloodletting in one 
industry," Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, others have said, there is some debate -- denied by a senior 
Treasury official -- that sensitive currency manipulation is required. In such 
a course, the value of the dollar would be weakened against the yen to make 
U.S. exports cheaper and Japanese imports more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Missing, too, they complain, has been a direct linking of economic and 
security issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think you have to see it in a more integrated way, but that hasn't come 
about because it's been a disparate process," said one Clinton adviser, 
pointing out that the State Department and Pentagon are reluctant to jeopardize 
the security relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 But among the Administration's most consistent trade allies in Congress, such 
as Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento), there is little worry. 
</P>
<P>
 "My guess is it will work itself out," said the chairman of the Ways and Means 
subcommittee on trade. "The Japanese (will) understand when we say something we 
mean it, and we will treat the Japanese as equal trading partners. They have 
their own point of view and will be respected."

 The Clinton Administration began moving Monday to maintain the momentum of the 
successful cease-fire in Bosnia and to broaden the allied peace initiative 
beyond Sarajevo to other parts of that beleaguered country. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying that most of the Bosnian Serb and Muslim artillery either had now been 
removed from the Sarajevo area or turned over to U.N. forces, the White House 
announced that representatives of the United States, its West European allies 
and Russia will meet in Bonn today to consider what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton declared the initial phase of the operation, launched by a 
Feb. 9 NATO threat to bomb any un-monitored Serbian artillery remaining near 
Sarajevo after early Monday morning, a success. He met briefly with his top 
national security advisers to review options for expanding the cease-fire 
around Sarajevo and for speeding the stalled Bosnian peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said the allies were considering expanding the NATO ultimatum 
by threatening to attack the heavy weapons of any warring faction that tried to 
fire upon U.N. humanitarian relief convoys elsewhere in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is also backing a peace initiative proposed by the 
Muslims that would create a combined Muslim-Croatian central government, with 
additional territory for each of the two factions from land that has been 
seized by Serbian forces. The new Muslim-Croatian government would ultimately 
unite with the Serbs in a loose confederation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge . . . is to build on this week's progress and create a lasting 
and workable peace for all the people of Bosnia," Clinton told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The action by the allies came as Sarajevo enjoyed its 10th straight day of 
freedom from Serbian artillery shelling. Reports from the area said U.N. 
peacekeeping forces were moving in to take control of the Serbian guns that had 
not yet been pulled back from the capital or already turned over to the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said 
Serbian commanders had either removed or surrendered to U.N. forces some 250 
artillery pieces, tanks and other heavy weapons, by far the bulk of what they 
had in place. He said Muslim forces, who are opposing the Serbs, had 
surrendered 46. 
</P>
<P>
 As of late Monday, no allied air strikes had been requested to enforce the 
NATO ultimatum. Allied planes were making runs from Aviano, Italy, and other 
air bases on Monday, but only to make sure that the NATO order was being 
observed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, a Muslim, said on nationwide television: 
"Celebrate this victory and don't be afraid anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, U.N. officials reported heavy Serbian shelling of the 
Bosnian city of Bihac on Monday and artillery attacks on the city of Mostar by 
Bosnian Croat forces. Neither area is covered by the NATO order. 
</P>
<P>
 And Shalikashvili conceded that the allies did not know precisely how many 
weapons the Serbs actually had in the Sarajevo area because they had not been 
able to count them, given the snowy weather and large number of hiding places 
in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not know specifically how many moved, as we did not count every weapon 
that has been moved out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. and allied officials warned the Serbs that the NATO order affecting 
Sarajevo will continue and that any Serbian unit that brought its weapons back 
near the city or resumed firing in the area would be subject to NATO air 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We on the military side are very well aware that this is not the end yet," 
Shalikashvili told reporters Monday. He said NATO planes had flown some 150 
sorties on Monday alone to make sure that the situation around Sarajevo 
remained unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Naples, Italy, U.S. Adm. Jeremy Boorda, who commands NATO forces in 
Southern Europe, pledged that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would 
greet any violation of its ultimatum with air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission is not over," Boorda declared. "It is a continuing mission. Any 
weapons that are not under control will be subject to air strikes. If any 
weapons are moved back into the exclusion zone they will be subject to air 
strikes. Anyone who shoots at Sarajevo from anywhere is subject to attack." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also expressed apprehension about speculation that the Serbs might 
use some of the artillery they removed from around Sarajevo to shell other 
Bosnian cities, such as Tuzla and Srebrenica, which continue under siege. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing what we can to discourage it," Clinton said, "and we believe that 
others will too, including the Russians." The Russians, who sent 400 troops to 
Bosnia on Sunday, are traditional allies of the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the meeting in Bonn today is expected to be preliminary, and no 
major decisions are considered likely. The session has been expanded to include 
a wide array of officials from key NATO countries, Russia and the U.N. 
peacekeeping command. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in a separate development, Haris Silajdzic, the prime minister of 
the Muslim-led Bosnian government, told U.S. leaders that his country's major 
objectives in the talks are to halt Serbian attacks, gain somewhat more 
territory and rebuild the former Yugoslav republic's shattered economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prelude to the Bonn session, Silajdzic met with U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher to review options for expanding the peace process and to ask 
for reconstruction aid from the West. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately clear what proposals the allies will pursue next, but 
there were several on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, the U.N. commander in Bosnia, has proposed 
using similar NATO ultimatums to clear the heavy weapons from Tuzla and 
Srebrenica and eventually from the other major Bosnian cities that have been 
declared U.N.-protected areas. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Administration appeared cautious Monday on both possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about extending the ultimatums to Tuzla and Srebrenica, Shalikashvili 
warned against NATO's taking on any more obligations until it is certain that 
Sarajevo is secure. "This is the time now to consolidate," he said, " . . . 
before we overreach someplace else." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said, however, that the Administration might consider 
supporting a proposal to extend the threat of NATO air strikes to cover attacks 
by any of the three warring parties -- the Serbs, the Muslims and the Croats -- 
on U.N. humanitarian relief convoys. 
</P>
<P>
 As they have done consistently in recent days, U.S. officials gave most of the 
credit for this past weekend's successes to the Clinton Administration and to 
NATO, mentioning only in passing last week's Russian initiative that helped 
persuade the Serbs to surrender their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry told reporters that the United States had 
turned down a suggestion by Russian Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev on Monday 
that Washington send U.S. troops to help with U.N. peacekeeping operations in 
Bosnia, saying it would do so only to enforce a peace accord. 
</P>

Naples contributed to this report.

SCENARIOS FOR A 2ND KOREAN WAR GRIM FOR U.S., SOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, American and South Korean military planners have studied what they 
sometimes call the Second Korean War. They have played out the war games and 
the scenarios aren't pretty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The north's plan has two options to it," explains Paul Godwin of the Defense 
Department's National War College, an expert on Asian military affairs who has 
played the role of a North Korean in the war games. "One is to take Seoul 
quickly and sue for peace. The other is to bypass Seoul and kick us out in a 
blitzkrieg.  
</P>
<P>
 "Either way, we won't have the buildup that we had for (the Persian Gulf War). 
This would be more like a Soviet invasion of Germany. The north comes over, 
we've got no more than 24 to 72 hours lead time. Once American forces die -- 
and they would die -- we're going to go." 
</P>
<P>
 That, in a nutshell, is the daunting military problem that would confront U.S. 
armed forces in a second Korean war. Top military officials insist that the 
United States and its allies would win such a war, but some defense experts are 
not so sure. And even if the allies were victorious, their casualties would be 
enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 These war scenarios explain why the United States has gone to such 
extraordinary lengths to negotiate with and conciliate a Pyongyang regime that 
has repeatedly flouted international law and stalled on living up to its 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent sign of these conciliatory policies came last Tuesday, when 
the International Atomic Energy Agency reached a deal with North Korea for the 
inspection of seven of its nuclear installations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton Administration officials acknowledged that even on these 
inspections, North Korea got special treatment. The inspections, one official 
admitted, will be "more limited than the routine, ad hoc inspections the IAEA 
has in other countries." And the agreement merely puts Pyongyang back to where 
it was exactly a year ago, when the international agency first sought the right 
to make special inspections of two nuclear waste dumps in North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 If North Korea goes along with the inspections, the Administration has 
promised to cancel this year's annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises. And 
if the Pyongyang regime goes along with other inspections and gives up its 
nuclear weapons program, the Administration has promised other rewards, even 
economic help and diplomatic recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 Why does the United States tolerate North Korea's continuing defiance in a way 
that it did not with Iraq's President Saddam Hussein? Why doesn't the world's 
leading military power rely more heavily on threats to use force? Or why not 
employ economic sanctions, which North Korea has said it would consider an act 
of war? 
</P>
<P>
 Some answers can be traced to the Pentagon strategy in a Korean war, contained 
in a highly secret Pentagon document labeled U.S. Forces Korea OpPlan 5027. The 
war plan was revamped in the early 1990s by Gen. Robert W. RisCassi when he was 
commander in chief of American and South Korean forces in the Korean theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few people know the plan's details, but its general outlines are clear. 
According to interviews with present and former U.S. defense officials, 
military commanders and diplomats, a Korean war would be an extremely bloody 
conflict in which South Korean ground forces, especially, might suffer heavy 
casualties at the outset. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would rely on the South Koreans in the initial stages of a war for the 
ground defense and the ground combat capability," Adm. Charles R. Larson, 
commander in chief of U.S. forces in the Pacific, told The Times in a recent 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States would provide a lot of things that we do very well -- such 
as indications and warning, intelligence, sophisticated systems, air power . . 
. Navy and Marine Corps power -- as we are then mobilizing and shipping heavier 
forces and ground forces." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. jet fighters, including F-15s and F-16s, would be brought in from bases 
in the Pacific Rim and the United States. The United States would deploy 
aircraft carriers and surface ships carrying Tomahawk missiles. And it would 
send in a rapid-deployment corps, composed mainly of light infantry, along with 
heavy firepower and some armor, from Hawaii and Ft. Lewis, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of a strategic air campaign "would be to try and blind them," says 
Godwin. "The F-117 (Stealth aircraft) pilots are going to be busy." 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea's air force has only some substandard Soviet MIG-21s and MIG-29s. 
Primarily because of fuel shortages, its pilots train for an average of only 20 
hours a year. In any conflict, air superiority would go very quickly to the 
allied forces, U.S. officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. military planners believe that with American reinforcements, the allies 
would beat back North Korean forces and drive not only toward but past the 
capital of Pyongyang -- stopping, however, well short of the Chinese border. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can bet that if war breaks out, American diplomats will be in Beijing 
saying, 'We'll stay well clear of your borders, and here are the rules of 
pursuit,' " says one experienced U.S. defense official. 
</P>
<P>
 The American plans, of course, were drawn up with a specific history in mind: 
that of the first Korean War, which broke out June 25, 1950, when North Korean 
forces invaded the south and drove deep into South Korean territory. Gen. 
Douglas MacArthur soon counterattacked, landing American troops behind enemy 
lines at Inchon and driving toward the Yalu River border between North Korea 
and China. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese "volunteer" troops then entered the war, pushing U.S. and South Korean 
forces back and into a bloody, prolonged stalemate. In all, 33,629 Americans 
died and another 103,284 were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Much has happened in the last four decades that might change how a new Korean 
war would be fought. South Korea has developed and prospered in a way that once 
seemed unimaginable -- giving it enormous economic power and, at the same time, 
tremendous property interests to protect if conflict broke out. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea no longer can rely on Chinese political and economic support, much 
less hundreds of thousands of troops. The Soviet Union, Pyongyang's other 
longtime patron and supplier of cheap oil, does not even exist. And on the 
allied side, the end of the Cold War has given a new, tremendous war-fighting 
boost to the United States: Once war broke out, the best American units would 
go immediately to Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deterrent value of the United States is much greater now," says Douglas 
Paal, a former National Security Council official for the Ronald Reagan and 
George Bush administrations. "There is no alternative front. We don't have to 
keep some of our best forces on the North German plain." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many military analysts believe that a new Korean war could prove just 
as difficult for American and South Korean forces as the first one. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea has an active force of 1.3 million men, including 1.1 million 
ground forces, American officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're talking about ground troops, North Korea is a very formidable 
force," says one U.S. official. "They are not Iraqis. They are trained, tough, 
disciplined and well led." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last decade, the North Koreans have deployed 60% to 70% of these 
troops near the Demilitarized Zone and border with South Korea. Only 25% of 
those forces were in forward locations in the late 1970s. The troops are 
frequently on alert status. These deployments are the result of a North Korean 
effort in the late 1970s to shift the balance of its defensive power to the 
border region and to make it more mechanized. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Pyongyang has also substantially changed the kinds of forces 
and armaments that it maintains in the border area. Military analysts say that 
the picture is particularly worrisome because the North Koreans have massive 
artillery emplacements in hardened sites and because they have an estimated 
100,000 "commando rangers" -- the largest contingent of special forces in the 
world -- ready to knock out South Korean communications, supply and transport 
networks and the airports and harbors at which American reinforcements would be 
landed. 
</P>
<P>
 Strategists believe that North Korea would launch massive artillery barrages 
as cover -- and then rush across the border with its vastly superior number of 
ground troops, trying to move enough units around to break through the South 
Korean lines at some key points and then encircle the defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the northern troops broke through the southern lines, they say, the war 
might be all but over. The north could break up supply lines in the south, take 
over Seoul and push on through the rest of South Korea. Except for the area 
around the border, the rest of South Korea is not heavily defended. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Korean strategy, says Ronald N. Montaperto of the National Defense 
University's Institute for National Strategic Studies, "would be to drive far 
south and wreak heavy destruction and then look for a political settlement." 
</P>
<P>
 "They would try to go farther and faster than last time because they know they 
aren't going to get help from the Russians or Chinese. They would hope that the 
costs of another Inchon invasion would be so heavy that we would sue for 
peace." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. analysts say that the South Korean army of about 500,000 men is not in 
tiptop shape and is badly deployed. The main part of it -- 12 forward divisions 
and 30 divisions and a support brigade behind -- is laid out in a thin line of 
defense along the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Some U.S. analysts say another crucial factor is that South Korean troops are 
not trained in the tactic of massing to defend a specific point or, in other 
cases, falling back to trade space for time, which is critical in this 
situation. South Korea has few units in reserve to launch any kind of 
counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
 With those weaknesses in mind, these analysts worry, the South Korean army 
might not be able to hold out for the two full months needed before U.S. 
reinforcements would finish arriving. 
</P>
<P>
 American officials contend that those deficiencies stem from the South Korean 
belief that the United States provides a strong deterrent to North Korean 
aggression and that, in the end, U.S. forces would provide enough power to 
defeat North Korea in a war. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea also has limited supplies of ammunition. It has built few military 
storage facilities, because its politically powerful farmers have demanded all 
available flatlands for growing rice. And evacuation would be difficult because 
a war would cause massive traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
 If war breaks out, says Godwin, "those on the forward edge of the battle area 
are going to get chewed up. Very badly. The reinforcements will have to come in 
to take care of absolutely incredible casualties." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States maintains just over 37,000 troops in South Korea. These 
troops function as a tripwire, to show North Korea that any invasion of South 
Korea would touch off a war with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined American and South Korean war plan has been updated roughly every 
10 years -- most recently by RisCassi, who served as the commander of allied 
forces in Korea until last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "RisCassi redid the war plan, and it's very realistic now," says one U.S. 
source who has seen it. "It's no longer hey-diddle-diddle, we push them back 
across the border and that's that. It's got a lot of blood and gore to it." 
</P>
<P>
 The aim would be initially to contain North Korean forces north of Seoul, and 
then eventually launch a counterattack to defeat them there and overrun the 
rest of North Korea. Yet some critics say that this strategy is unrealistic. 
They fear that the North Korean forces could break through the South Korean 
lines within a week to 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Snider, chief military analyst for the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies in Washington, says that the strategy for defending South 
Korea "is considered to be one of the toughest war plans to execute." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the cavalry-to-the-rescue strategy," says Robert W. Gaskin, a former 
Pentagon planner. "But the cavalry can't get there as fast as they think." 
</P>
<P>
 Like its air force, however, North Korea's army is limited by shortages of 
fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do they have enough petrol, oil and lubricants to drive to Pusan?" Godwin 
asks. "Or are they stuck with trying to take Seoul and sue for peace?" 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea's economic plight means that as time goes on in a war and American 
reinforcements arrive, the advantage would increasingly shift to the allies -- 
provided South Korean forces could hold their defensive lines. 
</P>
<P>
 By some worst-case scenarios, in even a short war of several weeks, American 
forces could suffer enormous casualties of up to 20,000 soldiers killed and 
wounded. The losses of North and South Koreans would be much higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be a lot of significant loss of life on both sides," says Larson. 
"But certainly our alliance is very capable of winning that war."

RISKS ABOUND IN CONTRACTING FOR QUAKE REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE and JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anyone who knows how to use a hammer, it seems, has acquired a new specialty: 
earthquake repair. Across the Los Angeles Basin, at roadsides and on chain-link 
fences, contractors are posting signs touting their skills. "Quick Earthquake 
Repair!" shouts a hand-painted sign in Granada Hills. "Quake Aid Contractors," 
reads another. 
</P>
<P>
 In their zeal for work, builders and would-be builders have been leaving 
flyers in mailboxes and on windshields, and shoving them inside tents where 
families slept outside damaged homes. Handymen have 800 numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not even awake, and they just attack you," said Nancy Spitz of 
Northridge, who camped for several days with her family outside a home that 
lost two chimneys, a block wall and part of its roof in the quake. "They don't 
let you sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the tumultuous shaking, the Northridge quake has unleashed a residential 
construction boom not seen in this basin since its citrus groves were cleared 
for tract homes decades ago. The promise of work, millions upon millions of 
dollars of it, is drawing licensed and unlicensed contractors, day laborers and 
handymen from other counties and states to this newfound land of opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 An incomplete tally by building inspectors in Los Angeles and Santa Monica 
suggests the magnitude of the residential reconstruction job ahead: nearly 
6,500 single-family homes have been declared seriously damaged or unsafe for 
occupancy in Los Angeles. The repair tab for homes, condominiums and apartments 
exceeds $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In neighborhoods spared severe damage, the quake tumbled chimneys and toppled 
block walls that need to be rebuilt or replaced. Los Angeles is issuing 150 
building permits daily, five times the usual number, a pace certain to quicken 
when homeowners receive insurance money and loans to finance major repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 With so much work up for grabs in Los Angeles, unqualified builders -- and 
outright con artists -- are transforming themselves into "contractors" for the 
cost of printing flyers or business cards. Authorities say homeowners who have 
lost much in the quake stand to lose more if they are not careful about whom 
they hire. 
</P>
<P>
 Although authorities say most of California's estimated 580,000 licensed and 
unlicensed contractors do satisfactory work, officials have logged about 300 
complaints about gouging on prices for everything from chimney and roof repair 
to water heater and sewer line replacements. Opportunistic builders who 
advertised free estimates are charging for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, the Contractors State License Board receives 300 to 500 complaints a 
year from the San Fernando Valley, where the quake was centered. But Larry 
Chaffee, assistant regional director of the board, said based on past 
disasters, he expects a threefold jump in complaints from the Valley and 
elsewhere in the quake zone -- despite efforts to limit problems with 
high-profile police sweeps and a hot line that consumers can call. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida's Hurricane Andrew and the Bay Area's Loma Prieta quake left swaths of 
destruction that attracted thousands of workers, creating an atmosphere of 
confusion that led to scattered abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Florida are still receiving complaints about contractor 
incompetence and fraud, nearly two years after the hurricane damaged or 
destroyed 87,000 homes. They estimate that at least 5% of those homeowners were 
ripped-off, paying contractors an average of $31,000 for work not done or done 
poorly. Many defrauded South Florida homeowners have been forced to pay for 
repairs twice, hiring new contractors to complete the work when building 
officials ordered substandard repairs removed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, officials say they are prepared to do the same when 
substandard work is discovered. Although too swamped with safety inspections to 
check construction, the city is developing a computerized list of quake-damaged 
properties that inspectors will match against building permits later on to 
check for illegal work, said Dave Kiem, principal building inspector for the 
Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety. Homeowners will be ordered to 
tear out work that does not meet code, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials are compiling a virtual catalogue of complaints from 
earthquake victims who say they were pressured to pay steep prices for 
immediate repairs. Two-thirds of the complaints were about plumbers, some of 
whom were accused of selling water heaters for as much as $1,000. The 
allegations are under investigation by the Los Angeles city attorney's office, 
and no charges have yet been filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Deputy City Atty. Kimery Shelton said anxious homeowners are most 
vulnerable to the hard sell: "They want (work) done immediately rather than 
sleep on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Take the case of Woodland Hills homeowner Helen Holmes. Warned by a contractor 
that her chimney could collapse with "the next aftershock," she paid $1,500 to 
have it removed. Her relief turned to anger, she said, when neighbors told her 
they had paid a different contractor $700 for similar work. 
</P>
<P>
 Daylene Carroll of Hollywood said she ended a high-pressure three-way phone 
conversation with two chimney contractors when she overheard a voice on the 
other end of the line cry: "Charge her up the gazoo." 
</P>
<P>
 Other contractors, some homeowners say, are charging up to $60 for estimating 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some contractors admit that in the confusion immediately after the quake, 
mistakes were made. The owner of Hollywood-based Chimney Jack, Gary Brennan, 
said he has refunded money to customers overcharged by an "eager beaver" 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Contractors say most complaints result from sticker shock affecting homeowners 
facing massive repairs and confused by quotes from day laborers, who may charge 
half what a licensed contractor charges. And some contractors say they deserve 
higher fees than usual because the work is hazardous and they are putting in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 For homeowners eager to get repair work done, sorting through contractor 
solicitations is work in itself. Day laborers have been canvassing 
neighborhoods, agreeing to knock down chimneys for $150. Contractors who are 
looking for work repairing block walls have been dumping stacks of flyers at 
disaster relief centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Advertising circulars carry pages of contractor listings, many providing state 
contractor license numbers. In a check of a dozen "contractors" advertising in 
the Feb. 3 issue of the Recycler, The Times found that two had suspended 
licenses for failure to carry workers' compensation insurance, one had an 
expired license that had belonged to someone else, and one had a phony license 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's pretty typical," said Anne Armstrong, who runs a contractor referral 
service in Laguna Hills. She estimates that one-quarter to one-third of 
contractors who run ads stating that they are licensed do not have an active 
license, so consumers must research contractors' credentials before hiring one. 
</P>
<P>
 That is if homeowners are lucky enough to get that far. As some are 
discovering, the blizzard of solicitations does not mean contractors will come 
when called. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley Armas said it took 26 days and many phone calls to find a licensed 
contractor willing to estimate damage to her Northridge home. Many contractors 
failed to return messages. Those who did said they were too busy or wanted to 
be paid up to $60 for an estimate. One contractor who had promised to come was 
a no-show. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good to finally have someone here," Armas said, as her husband led 
the contractor on a tour of cracked walls, fallen tile and leaky water pipes on 
a recent Saturday. "Who knows when the work will finally get done?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Contractors State License Board ran into the same problem when setting up 
an undercover sting for unlicensed contractors at a quake-damaged Northridge 
home. All but three of 40 contractors contacted by an undercover agent said 
they were too busy to provide an estimate. One of the three contractors who 
agreed to come did not show up. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, state Department of Consumer Affairs Director Jim Conran said 
there are enough licensed contractors to do the work. Only licensed contractors 
can legally perform repairs of more than $300. 
</P>
<P>
 To become licensed, a contractor must have experience in the trade, pass a 
written test and have workers' compensation insurance in case a worker gets 
hurt. Contractors are also required to post a $5,000 bond so some money is 
available to repay customers in the event of fraud or other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Using an unlicensed contractor could leave a homeowner with no bond to tap if 
they are cheated and vulnerable to lawsuits from workers injured on the job. 
Unlicensed contractors cannot get building permits, so their work generally 
does not get inspected. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship is risky for unlicensed contractors, too. They cannot sue to 
enforce their contracts and, since the Northridge quake, they face possible 
felony charges for working in a disaster area. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Florida, where the National Guard helped arrest 500 contractors, 
undermanned authorities here are counting on heavy doses of publicity to scare 
off the state's estimated 300,000 unlicensed contractors from competing with 
licensed contractors for jobs. Stings and sweeps, no matter how small, have 
become media events. 
</P>
<P>
 With a hidden camera for "NBC Dateline" rolling, a four-hour sting in 
Northridge recently ended with a single arrest: an unlicensed painter who was 
handcuffed and cited with a criminal misdemeanor. A Reseda contractor with a 
suspended license was allowed to go with a warning. Conran, the consumer 
affairs official, was on hand after flying from Sacramento to, as he put it, 
"stop these lice." A Times reporter and photographer also attended. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days earlier, two local television news crews accompanied Los Angeles 
Police Department fraud investigators and agents from the Contractors State 
License Board on a sweep through Granada Hills and Porter Ranch. There were 
four arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 quake, at least 17 people have been arrested, four on felony 
charges for working in a declared disaster area without a license. One was 
handyman Mark Monday, who was caught in a Burbank sting filmed by KCBS-TV as he 
gave undercover agents a $600 bid to tear down a chimney and haul it away. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these charges stick, they'll ruin me," said Monday, a part-time handyman 
and licensed security guard. In his defense, Monday has collected letters from 
longtime clients -- apartment management firms and homeowners -- who attest 
that he has never posed as a contractor and say he has done excellent work. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor handling the felony cases acknowledges that they do not involve 
typical bad guys. "I'm sure they are hard-working people just trying to make a 
living," said John Luder, deputy district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Luder said he plans to seek community service and fines rather than jail time 
for most of those who are convicted. Under new guidelines, he said, felony 
charges will be filed only against people doing structural work worth at least 
$3,000. "Our concern is with work posing safety risks to consumers," Luder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities anticipate that organized gangs of con artists who gravitate from 
disaster to disaster will arrive in the region. Police say these people pose as 
contractors, take hefty deposits for little or no work and run. The scams will 
not appear for several more weeks or months, until homeowners receive insurance 
payments and bank loans to finance major reconstruction, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know that we are looking at them and investigating them," said Lt. Ken 
Welty of the LAPD's major fraud unit. "They are not just unlicensed 
contractors; they're crooks." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, authorities say, homeowners must protect themselves against the 
perils of the reconstruction era, Los Angeles style. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda homeowner Robert Yetter succeeded the first time out. His neighbor 
leased a chain-link fence for $300. Yetter bought his for $140. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Yetter is dealing with his damaged block wall. A contractor wants $4,000 
to rebuild it. A man who helped Yetter's wife gather bricks and left his card 
one afternoon will do it for less. The man is not licensed and has no 
insurance, but if properly supervised, Yetter reasons, everything should be OK. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, it's like anything else," he said. "It's buyer beware." Tips for 
Homeowners With Quake Damage 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some steps that consumer organizations and law enforcement officials 
advise you to follow to make sure you get what you pay for when hiring a 
contractor: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask the contractor for his state license number and call the Contractors 
State License Board at (800) 321-2752 to verify it. Ask if there are 
outstanding complaints against the contractor. There are 43 types of licenses, 
so make sure the contractor is licensed for the work you need done. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask the contractor about his workers' compensation insurance and call the 
carrier to verify coverage. You could be liable for the contractor's 
work-related injuries if the insurance is not valid. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't be pressured to make a decision. Get references and check them, and 
take time to get other estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Never pay a deposit at the first meeting. If you are asked for a deposit, 
end discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Once you have selected a contractor, insist in writing that the contractor 
must show you receipts for all materials and payments to subcontractors before 
you pay him for the job. If a contractor stiffs his suppliers, they can slap 
mechanics liens on your property, even if you have paid the contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't pay cash and never make a down payment larger than 10% of total cost 
of the work, or $1,000, whichever is less. Agree to a payment schedule and 
never let payments get ahead of work done. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you hire an unlicensed contractor, be aware that you could be sued for 
on-the-job injuries and that the work may not be up to code.

2 OFFICERS DENY SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Speaking publicly for the first time Monday, two Los Angeles police officers 
at the center of a sweeping LAPD sexual harassment inquiry vehemently denied 
that they have ever mistreated women and insisted they are victims of 
vindictive department managers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I categorically deny" all the allegations, said Officer Jay Varga, a 
much-lauded LAPD veteran, who with Officer Stephen M. McNicholas has been 
accused of mistreating female colleagues. "They are all false. . . . We haven't 
harassed anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 A personnel complaint filed against the two officers in October accuses them 
of deriding the abilities of female and minority officers, complaining that 
women were unfairly promoted because of their gender, making a number of 
sexually or racially inappropriate remarks and, on one occasion each, failing 
to come to the aid of female officers in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Those allegations and other purported instances of misconduct are at the heart 
of a massive LAPD internal investigation into the working relationships between 
male and female officers in the department's West Los Angeles area -- served by 
a police station with a long reputation of hostility toward women. Although 
McNicholas and Varga are among those under investigation, department sources 
say the LAPD inquiry -- formally known as an audit -- also has delved into 
questions about whether supervisors tolerated or reinforced hostile attitudes 
toward women at the station. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit has created intense friction within the department. Some officers 
believe that McNicholas and Varga are the victims of a "witch hunt," while 
others say that at least some of the allegations are true. The Los Angeles 
Police Protective League has stood by the embattled officers, while the 
president of the Oscar Joel Bryant Foundation, which represents black LAPD 
officers, on Monday issued a statement criticizing the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Protective League is the guardian of the rights of all of its members, 
not the trier of fact," Leonard Ross, the newly installed Bryant Foundation 
president, said in a statement. "In the future, I hope our league directors . . 
. will be more mindful of the league's obligations and concerns of all 
members." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they would not allow photographs, McNicholas and Varga consented to 
an interview Monday with reporters from The Times and KNBC Channel 4 News. In 
that interview, McNicholas echoed Varga's denials and said he believes the LAPD 
is bent on punishing them because they successfully fought an attempt to 
transfer them last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a result of our exercising our rights, the department has gone to these 
lengths to back up bogus allegations," said McNicholas, who, like Varga, has 
continued to receive sterling performance evaluations even while under 
investigation for the alleged sexual harassment. "They'll try to get us any way 
they can." 
</P>
<P>
 McNicholas said LAPD investigators had asked him not to discuss the specific 
allegations, and he declined to do so, saying he did not want to be accused of 
defying LAPD orders. Documents obtained by The Times appear to cast doubt on at 
least one of the charges, in which he was accused of failing to assist a female 
officer who was wrestling with a suspect in the back of a police car. 
</P>
<P>
 The personnel complaint only generally describes the incident and says it 
occurred between October, 1990, and October, 1991. Although the complaint does 
not provide a precise date, it identifies the female officer as Debbie 
Winchell. 
</P>
<P>
 Winchell's report of an incident during that period makes no mention of 
misconduct on McNicholas' part. "I was in the back seat with the defendant, and 
my partner (McNicholas) was in the front seat driving," according to the Nov. 
10, 1990, report, obtained Monday by The Times. "The defendant raised his left 
leg over the front seat and proceeded to kick Officer McNicholas before I could 
react." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, the suspect kicked McNicholas three times in the head 
and shoulder and then McNicholas climbed over the front seat to assist 
Winchell. In the report, Winchell does not allege that McNicholas failed to 
help her. A sergeant's report about the same incident also makes no mention of 
wrongdoing on McNicholas' part. 
</P>
<P>
 McNicholas declined to comment on the reports, except to say that he did 
nothing wrong and that he sustained injuries as a result of the altercation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate count, Varga also was accused of failing to assist a female 
officer who needed help. According to the personnel complaint, Officer Paget 
Mitchell said that Varga had failed to assist her with a combative suspect at 
the West Los Angeles jail sometime between January and March of 1990. Mitchell 
told The Times last week that the allegation in that complaint is accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, however, Varga said he had never refused to come to Mitchell's aid and 
had not been aware that she needed help. 
</P>
<P>
 "She never said anything to me," Varga said. "I never even knew there was a 
problem until it arose as an allegation." 
</P>
<P>
 Varga and McNicholas also denied making a number of sexually and racially 
charged remarks attributed to them in the personnel complaint. According to the 
complaint, the two men referred to a police car containing two women officers 
as a "bitch car." Varga, the complaint states, told a female officer that "I'm 
working with you because I have to, not because I want to," and McNicholas 
allegedly told a female officer: "No white man would want to rape a black woman 
because they are too ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 "The entire personnel complaint is a lie," McNicholas said Monday. "Both of us 
respect women. We're both married, we both have small children. . . . We don't 
talk that way, and we don't condone people talking that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Although McNicholas and Varga could face disciplinary charges for their 
alleged misconduct, they are not the only officers at the West Los Angeles 
station to come under scrutiny in recent months. More than 100 officers have 
been interviewed as part of an extraordinary, four-month audit by the LAPD's 
Office of Operations. 
</P>
<P>
 That audit, which is all but complete, probed the station's working 
environment and attempted to determine whether it was hostile to women. A 
number of officers have come under investigation, as has the performance of 
supervisors who, according to department sources, either failed to detect 
sexism or tolerated it. 
</P>
<P>
 McNicholas and Varga have been transferred as a result of the inquiry. They 
start their new jobs today, but have been placed in positions where they are to 
have no contact with female colleagues or female members of the public. The two 
officers also are likely to face departmental charges of some sort, LAPD 
sources say, adding that administrative action against other employees also is 
being considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, the lawyer for McNicholas and Varga suggested that his clients were 
being accorded unequal treatment. The lawyer, Gregory G. Petersen, said there 
was no punishment meted out to a senior officer who allegedly had been carrying 
on an affair with a subordinate at the West Los Angeles station. Other officers 
from the station say rumors of the affair reached the highest levels of the 
LAPD's command staff. Such a relationship would violate LAPD rules if it began 
while the senior officer was charged with supervising the other officer. 
Department officials declined to comment on the alleged affair.

2 SLAIN POLICE OFFICERS ARE EULOGIZED AS HEROES; FUNERAL: THEY ARE LAUDED FOR 
SAVING OTHERS FROM GUNMAN'S BULLETS. ABOUT 4,000 ATTEND EMOTIONAL SERVICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As a lone bagpiper played a soulful rendition of "Amazing Grace," an estimated 
4,000 mourners gathered Monday on a grassy knoll overlooking Los Angeles Harbor 
to bid farewell to two slain Palos Verdes Estates police officers, who were 
lauded as heroes for saving fellow officers by breaking up an armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 The afternoon service and the funeral that preceded it were an exercise in 
high formality and raw emotion. Capt. Michael Wayne Tracy and Sgt. Vernon 
Thomas Vanderpool were honored with a 21-gun salute, a sheriff's helicopter 
flyover and a procession of 64 motorcycles and untold black-and-whites. The 
strains of taps wafted over the harbor, punctuated by the sniffles of mourners. 
The officers' widows were presented with the American flags that had draped 
their husbands' coffins. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers from throughout the state -- and a handful from as far away as 
Texas and Wisconsin -- turned out to pay their respects. So did Gov. Pete 
Wilson, Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams, Los Angeles County Dist. 
Atty. Gil Garcetti and a host of other dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Tough street cops fought back tears. A troop of Boy Scouts, clad in uniform, 
hung their heads as they helped guard the casket of Vanderpool, who had been 
the troop's assistant Scoutmaster for seven years. The chief of the close-knit 
Palos Verdes Estates Police Department broke down as he described his fallen 
comrades, particularly Tracy, who was his best friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "They loved being cops and they loved helping people and when they were 
called, they were heroes," said Chief Gary Johansen, who witnessed the 
killings. "They saved the lives of the other 11 people in that room, and I 
speak from experience because I was there. . . . These two officers saved our 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
 After praising Vanderpool as one of his most reliable officers, Johansen 
turned toward Tracy's coffin while reaching beneath his eyeglasses to wipe away 
tears. "God bless you, my friend," he said, his voice cracking. "I love you." 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy, 50, and Vanderpool, 57, were gunned down on Valentines Day, 
Vanderpool's 36th wedding anniversary. The shooting took place during a police 
management meeting on the 12th floor of the Torrance Holiday Inn. Witnesses 
said the gunman, 32-year-old David Joseph Fukuto -- the son of a state 
appellate judge -- burst into the meeting shouting, "This is a robbery!" 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say they may never know whether Fukuto -- who was wearing a 
bulletproof vest -- intended to rob the group, or whether he had a grudge 
against police officers. When Tracy and Vanderpool lunged at him, he shot them. 
Other officers subdued Fukuto, and he died in the ensuing struggle. The cause 
of his death remains undisclosed because the district attorney's office has 
sealed his autopsy reports while conducting its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy and Vanderpool were the first officers killed in the history of the 
affluent South Bay city, which prided itself on having its own small police 
force rather than contracting with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, 
as some neighboring communities do. 
</P>
<P>
 The deaths have so overwhelmed city officials and the 23-officer force that 
streets are temporarily being patrolled by officers from neighboring 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy has shaken those close to David Fukuto as well. On Sunday, the 
congregation at St. Mary's Episcopal Church in Koreatown, where he had been a 
vestry member and was known as quiet and well-mannered, replaced its regular 
service with counseling sessions for church members to talk about their grief 
and anger. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, members of the largely Japanese American church said they had trouble 
talking about what had happened. "We . . . are very private people," said one 
church member who asked not to be named. "We're too full of grief and too 
crowded in our heads to talk right now. I just get into tears." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no mention of Fukuto at the police officers' funeral on Monday, at 
least not by name. But an underlying theme was the struggle to make sense of 
what seemed a nonsensical act. In a eulogy delivered for his father, Tracy's 
son, Sean Michael Tracy, said plaintively: "I don't understand many things in 
life. Funerals happen to be one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Byron MacDonald, the senior pastor of Rolling Hills Covenant Church, where the 
funeral was held, put it this way: "There are some moments in society that when 
they happen, give us a picture of who we are. . . . A week ago Monday at a 
Holiday Inn in Torrance was a picture of what is happening to us. . . . There's 
a darkness, there's an evil, there's an increasing resource to violence that is 
overtaking us." 
</P>
<P>
 MacDonald said he found a "glimmer of hope" in the actions of Vanderpool and 
Tracy. "Someone must stand to see that evil is restrained and that those who 
would break the law are brought to justice. Sgt. Vanderpool and Capt. Tracy 
represent the hope and the encouragement of what is best in us." 
</P>
<P>
 Security was tight at the funeral. Five sharpshooters were stationed on the 
church's roof. Because the families of the officers wanted the services to be 
private, only uniformed police officers and family members were permitted to 
enter the 1,100-seat chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the media watched on closed-circuit television, as did about 1,000 
mourners who arrived too late to get a seat in the standing-room-only 
sanctuary. Others stood outside. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremonies were laced with humor as well as sadness. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanderpool's nephew, Oceanside Police Detective Ken Gow, prefaced his eulogy 
with a gesture -- taking off his tie and unbuttoning his top shirt button. "Tom 
hated ties," Gow proclaimed, as the crowd erupted in applause. "He also hated 
long-sleeved shirts but there's nothing I can do about that now." 
</P>
<P>
 Gow then talked of how his uncle had guided him into a career in law 
enforcement, pushing him to finish his education. He also shared the 
recollections of Vanderpool's children, who sometimes heard their father crying 
in solitude after he had spanked them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom was a big man but he had a gentle heart," Gow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy's three children wrote a eulogy for their father, read aloud by Drake 
Morton, the Police Department chaplain. They described a man who loved 
dirt-bike racing, who thought he was "the funniest man alive," who believed in 
backing his friends and in making other people feel special. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in apparent reference to their father's taste for beer, the letter 
closed with these words: "P.S., Dad, we're looking forward to seeing your 
cheesy smile someday at the big Bud keg in the sky." 
</P>
<P>
 After the funeral, an elaborate motorcade of police cars, motorcycles and 
limousines carried family members, city officials and Palos Verdes Estates 
police officers to nearby Green Hills Memorial Park for the memorial service. 
The rest of the mourners walked to the cemetery, where they stood behind a low 
cinder-block wall -- and a human blockade of police officers -- to witness the 
service from a respectable distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of American flags lined the winding route into the cemetery, waving 
against a clear blue Southern California sky. At times, all that could be heard 
was their flapping in the afternoon breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 The somber ceremony lasted 45 minutes. At its close, after widows Billy Jean 
Vanderpool and Becky Tracy were presented with the flags, the members of the 
Palos Verdes Estates Police Department filed past their colleagues' bodies, 
laying their white gloves atop the blue steel coffins in a final gesture of 
solidarity.

ABOVE SARAJEVO, CONTROL OF ARMS FAR FROM CLEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eighteen heavy artillery pieces scattered across a square mile of rugged, 
snowy ridge have been deemed by the U.N. Protection Force to be firmly under 
the control of 2nd Lt. Spike Martin and his British platoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some of the mortars and howitzers on the steep flanks of this mountain 
village northwest of Sarajevo still have their barrels trained on the Bosnian 
capital. Not one has been inspected or dismantled by the U.N. forces assigned 
here. And all are clearly within easy reach of the machine-gun-slinging Serbian 
rebels, who outnumber Martin's 20-odd men at least three to one. 
</P>
<P>
 Although all heavy guns within a U.N.-designated exclusion zone around the 
Bosnian capital were supposed to have been withdrawn or surrendered to U.N. 
forces by 1 a.m. Monday local time, only one of the 18 said to be monitored at 
this official U.N. "collection center" is even within the British troops' 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
 The sole 105-millimeter howitzer actually pulled out of its sandbagged battery 
has been hitched to a Bosnian Serb army truck and parked about 100 yards 
downhill from the Britons' roadside encampment. 
</P>
<P>
 The local Serbian commander retains the truck keys. 
</P>
<P>
 As conditions at Osjek and at least 31 other weapons depots make clear, U.N. 
officials have papered over Serbian defiance of a NATO ultimatum for 
demilitarizing the hills ringing Sarajevo by declaring the status quo to be 
close enough to compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast and rugged Osjek slope is one of eight places within the 12-mile 
exclusion zone officially designated by U.N. officers as weapons containment 
sites. Eighteen other Serb-held areas around Sarajevo are known to still host 
heavy weapons covered by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ultimatum but 
are described by Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, the British commander of the U.N. 
peacekeeping force in Bosnia, as being under U.N. control. At least six other 
sites were brought to the United Nations' attention Monday after NATO aerial 
reconnaissance flights over the exclusion zone, bringing to 32 the total of 
known Serbian gun emplacements with U.N. supervision that is equal to or less 
than that at Osjek. 
</P>
<P>
 French public affairs officers who arranged a brief and heavily 
Serb-controlled visit to the Osjek gun emplacements Monday appeared chagrined 
at the sight of the hillside batteries that are virtually unchanged despite 
NATO's much-heralded ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
 The local Serbian commander, Col. Vladimir Radojic, held up the U.N.-arranged 
press visit until nightfall and then forbade journalists from photographing the 
weaponry, limiting the 10-minute tour to talks with the newly arrived 
deployment of Martin's platoon of the 2nd Company of Britain's Coldstream 
Guards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weapons are under our protection and containment over about a square 
kilometer," Martin replied when asked if his men had unequivocal control over 
the guns. The actual area placed under Martin's control Saturday was larger 
than the square kilometer he estimated: Just those Serbian gun emplacements 
visible from the roadside extended more than a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 The British troops had not been asked to inspect, relocate or render 
inoperable any of the weapons on their assigned terrain, said Martin, who could 
not say how many of the guns were still ready for firing because Radojic had 
yet to tell him. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he could guarantee that the weapons could never be retaken by the 
Serbian rebels whose homes and front-line positions surround the new U.N. 
encampment, Martin replied: "I don't think that would happen at the moment, 
because our relations with them are good. They want peace as much as anyone 
else wants peace." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. commander Rose has boasted that his formula for defining compliance with 
the ultimatum has brought about peace, as what was once a daily ration of 
hundreds of artillery shells blasted at Sarajevo has recently ceased. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 380,000 people still trapped in the Bosnian capital fear the end of 
bombardment may have come at the price of an indefinite armed standoff and 
long-term hindrances to their free movement, as they remain surrounded by armed 
Serbian forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Many also fear that the U.N. mission will tire of the costly, labor-intensive 
weapons-monitoring operation that seems largely to be a charade and will 
eventually abandon the so-called collection sites like the one at Osjek and 
allow rebel forces to resume their siege. 
</P>
<P>
 Western leaders had called for punitive air strikes in the event any 
un-relinquished heavy weaponry remained within the exclusion zone after 
Monday's deadline. But the appeals for forceful intervention have dissipated 
amid U.N. claims that the ultimatum has qualitatively eased the risks 
confronting Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those touring weapons containment sites such as Osjek was the senior 
U.S. liaison officer with the U.N. Protection Force, Lt. Col. Mitchell 
Triplett. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing the positive spin that Western political and military leaders have put 
on the NATO ultimatum and the improved security here that it is said to have 
created, Triplett declared the far-flung Serbian guns in the Osjek area to be 
under Martin's control. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're having some problems moving some of them. One down the hill there is 
going to need to be towed, and they (the Serbian rebels) don't have that 
equipment," the U.S. Marine Corps officer said, explaining why heavy weapons 
remained in their sandbagged dugouts. "But they are certainly under the control 
of those Brits. They'll blow them out of existence if anyone tries to take them 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 However, that was not Martin's interpretation of his marching orders in the 
event of confrontation. "We would resort to the rules of engagement defined by 
the United Nations," the British officer said. "They are based on principles of 
self-defense." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, he said, the Coldstream Guards deployed here could draw their 
weapons on the local Serbian fighters only if their own lives were in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 A Dutch military observer assigned to watch over the Osjek site seemed less 
eager to declare the situation under U.N. control. "I can't say that it is 100% 
secure here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow is so deep and the terrain so rugged that the armored vehicles would have 
difficulty maneuvering to some of the gun nests, and some of the artillery is 
so distant from the British redoubt that it would take 30 minutes or more to 
walk there.

HIGH COURT MAY REVERSE RETROACTIVELY IMPOSED TAX; LITIGATION: NEWPORT BEACH 
ESTATE CASE COULD PROVIDE A CHECK ON CONGRESS. INCOME TAX NOT LIKELY TO BE 
AFFECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Supreme Court appears poised to reverse nearly 60 years of giving Congress 
and the states virtually unchecked power to impose taxes retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
 Next Monday, the justices will consider the case of a Newport Beach tax 
attorney who lost $630,000 for a client in 1987 because Congress retroactively 
repealed an estate tax deduction that it had created in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Some tax experts are predicting the high court will use the case to say that 
Congress finally has gone too far. "The bottom line is the Supreme Court will 
hold this retroactive tax unconstitutional," predicted University of Minnesota 
law professor Ferdinand Schoettle. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will mean for the first time there is some constitutional limit on what 
Congress can do," said Richard Samp, chief counsel of the Washington Legal 
Foundation, which is representing 22 Republican senators who want the court to 
restrict retroactive taxing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the millions of Americans who find themselves paying higher taxes this 
spring because of the retroactive provisions included in last year's tax bill 
should not take heart. Tax experts and constitutional lawyers are nearly 
uniform in predicting that the court will not tamper with that sort of 
retroactive provision. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress historically has made changes in tax rates retroactive to the first 
of the year because the Internal Revenue Service cannot easily calculate income 
taxes if the rates shift in midyear. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's tax bill passed Congress on Aug. 10, and its higher tax rates were 
made retroactive to Jan. 1, 1993. The law also retroactively raised the top 
rates for estate and gift taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican senators opposed backdating the rate increases and contended that 
the Constitution prohibits imposing taxes retroactively. But the Supreme Court 
has not shared that view except during a brief period in the 1920s and early 
1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Constitution clearly bars ex post facto, or after-the-fact, laws. Since 
1798, the high court has interpreted that provision to limit only criminal 
laws, not civil ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fifth and 14th amendments also prohibit Congress and the states from 
taking a person's money "without due process of law." Usually, due process 
means that the person must be on notice of the law -- but not necessarily on 
notice in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the mid-1930s, the Supreme Court routinely scrutinized new laws 
affecting businesses or taxpayers to see whether they violated the "due 
process" provisions. For example, the justices provoked a political uproar by 
striking down laws mandating a minimum wage and overtime pay rates as 
violations of the rights of the workers and employers to negotiate their own 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 But during the New Deal, all of that changed. President Franklin D. Roosevelt 
appointed justices who would take a hands-off approach to business and economic 
matters. Since then, the court has given Congress virtually a free hand to 
regulate the economy and to impose taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Duke Law Journal analysis of retroactive laws since 1938 concluded 
that the high court's policy has been one of "judicial rubber-stamping." 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been extremely deferential (to Congress). They have allowed virtually 
anything," said Andrew Weiler, author of the article. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court admitted as much in a 1984 decision upholding the 
retroactive provisions of a new pension law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strong deference accorded legislation in the field of national economic 
policy is no less applicable when that legislation is applied retroactively," 
the court said. "Provided the retroactive provision . . . is supported by a 
legitimate legislative purpose furthered by rational means, judgments about the 
wisdom of such legislation remain within the exclusive province of the 
legislative and executive branches." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the case of U.S. vs. Carlton, 92-1941, may provide the vehicle for 
rethinking that approach. 
</P>
<P>
 It began in 1986, when Jerry W. Carlton, a Newport Beach lawyer, began 
preparing the estate tax return for Willametta Keck Day, an heiress to an oil 
fortune who had died late in the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 That October, Congress passed the 1986 Tax Reform Act, which included several 
provisions to encourage stock ownership by a company's employees. One section 
gave a tax deduction to the estate when the executor sold shares of a company's 
stock to an employee stock ownership plan, or ESOP. 
</P>
<P>
 So Carlton bought $11.2 million of MCI stock on the open market on Dec. 10, 
1986, and sold it privately two days later to MCI's ESOP for $10.57 million. 
The estate lost $630,000 on the sale but, thanks to the new tax break for sales 
of stock to ESOPs, the deal reduced the estate's tax bill by $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 29, Carlton filed the tax return for Day's estate and paid the $18 
million that was owed. Two days later, the Wall Street Journal wrote a story 
questioning the new estate tax deduction for stock sales to an ESOP. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a loophole you could drive a truck through," one accountant was 
quoted as saying. Apparently, key members of Congress had intended the 
deduction to apply only to stock owned by the estate before death. The law did 
not include that restriction, however. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS soon announced it would seek a change in the law. In the fall 
elections, the Democrats had won enough seats to reclaim control of the Senate, 
and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), the new chairman of the Finance Committee, 
introduced a bill in February, 1987, to repeal the estate tax deduction. The 
tax code should not encourage "essentially sham transactions," Bentsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Congress passed Bentsen's bill by the fall of 1987 and made its 
provisions retroactive to October, 1986. In short order, the IRS wrote Carlton 
and said the estate owed another $2.5 million in taxes, leaving it with nothing 
to show for its purchase and sale of the MCI stock but a $630,000 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government mousetrapped Jerry," said Russell Allen, who -- like Carlton 
-- is a partner in the Los Angeles firm of O'Melveny & Myers. "They held out 
the bait, he took it and then they slammed the trap shut." 
</P>
<P>
 After paying the disputed tax, Allen and Carlton filed a suit challenging the 
retroactive provisions as unconstitutional. And to the surprise of government 
lawyers, they won a ruling from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals 
invalidating the retroactive tax imposed on Day's estate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the court's opinion, a retroactive tax provision is unconstitutional if the 
taxpayer did not have "actual or constructive notice" of a later change and if 
he "relied to his detriment" on the law as it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were true in this case, the San Francisco-based appeals court said. 
"Carlton had no notice, actual or constructive. The estate entered into a 
transaction that cost it $630,000 based solely on the inducement of a tax 
deduction the government now wants to take away," wrote Judge Diarmuid 
O'Scannlain for the majority. 
</P>
<P>
 The case reached the Supreme Court last fall just as the National Taxpayers 
Union was going to court to challenge some of the retroactive provisions in the 
1993 tax hike. 
</P>
<P>
 "We strongly oppose any form of retroactive taxes," said David Keating, vice 
president of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 In its friend-of-the-court brief, the Washington Legal Foundation urges the 
justices to rule that a retroactive tax is absolutely unconstitutional when 
applied to "completed transactions." 
</P>
<P>
 If the high court adopted that view, the provisions in the 1993 legislation 
affecting estate and gift taxes could be in jeopardy. For example, Congress in 
August raised the top rate on estate taxes from 50% to 55% and applied that 
provision to estate tax returns filed after Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In its lawsuit in a federal district court here, the National Taxpayers Union 
is challenging that increase as unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 But even critics of the new law concede that the court will not tamper with 
the retroactive income tax provisions because those were not "completed 
transactions" when the bill became law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chances are about zero" that the court will invalidate the income tax 
increases, Schoettle said. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, Clinton Administration lawyers are fighting hard against 
Carlton's claim and seeking to preserve Congress' unchecked authority to 
increase taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Retroactive legislation rationally drawn to achieve a legitimate purpose" -- 
whether to close a loophole or raise revenue -- is constitutional, they contend 
in their court brief, "even if the statute imposes a liability that was not 
anticipated or upsets otherwise settled expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 The high court is expected to issue a ruling by July.

UNARMED GUARDS FATALLY SHOT IN ORANGE COUNTY; VIOLENCE: THE SHOOTINGS OCCURRED 
WITHIN TWO HOURS OF EACH OTHER. ONE WAS KILLED AT A MOVIE THEATER; THE OTHER IN 
A BAR PARKING LOT. BOTH MEN LEAVE BEHIND FAMILIES WITH BABIES.

 Two unarmed security guards were shot to death in Orange County within hours 
of each other Sunday night and early Monday morning, one in the lobby of a 
movie house and the other in the parking lot of a bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Dagoberto Carrero of Orange, 25, a former Marine and veteran of the Persian 
Gulf War, died in a barrage of gunfire about 11 p.m. Sunday as he stood at his 
post inside the lobby of the Century City Centre Theatre in Orange, police 
said. Investigators were looking for six teen-agers who earlier had threatened 
Carrero when he asked them to clear out of the theater after a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two hours later, Rupert Morales, 19, of Santa Ana was shot in the 
parking lot of Nick's Hide Away in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said Morales was attempting to direct a car to a parking space when 
someone in it fired two shots into his chest. 
</P>
<P>
 There did not appear to be any connection between the shootings, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both guards were fathers of baby daughters and were praised by employers and 
relatives for their dedication. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales "never had any money; he always put practically his whole check into 
supporting other people," said James Nowlin, director of security at Nick's 
Hide Away. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange on Monday afternoon, the shards of glass had been swept away at the 
movie theater by the time customers lined up to buy matinee tickets. A broken 
window was boarded up, and shattered doors had been replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous night, about an hour before closing, one or more suspects shot 
into the theater from an outdoor walkway, police said. Carrero, who was 
stationed at a podium facing the front window, tried to seek cover after he was 
shot in the face, but was shot a second time in the back, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunfire shattered two sets of glass doors and put a hole in the window of 
the ticket counter. No one else was in the line of fire; only one show was 
still playing, the snack bar was closed and the lobby was empty of customers. 
An assistant manager heard the gunfire from the theater office and called for 
paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they were seeking six teen-agers -- three girls and three boys -- 
who a witness said had threatened Carrero when he asked them to leave the 
theater so that a cleaning crew could straighten up at 7:15 p.m., after a 
showing of "Addams Family Values." 
</P>
<P>
 "They refused," said Lt. Timm Browne, an Orange police spokesman. "He asked 
again and they became hostile." 
</P>
<P>
 Browne said Carrero remained calm and chose to walk away. The teen-agers left 
the theater about 15 minutes later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bancroft, owner of Patrol One, the security guard company that employed 
Carrero, said the firm is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to 
the conviction of the killers. He described Carrero as "an outstanding 
officer." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrero leaves a wife, Nicole, and 9-month-old daughter, Jerelyn. He was 
planning to leave his security job in a few days and go to Texas to train for 
the Air National Guard, Bancroft said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrero, who came here from Puerto Rico, "was a young guy on his way to 
fulfilling the American dream," Bancroft said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove police were searching for a motive in the killing of Morales. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Fees, owner of the bar, said the only suspicious incident earlier in the 
evening had involved an underage male who was turned away at the front door and 
then jumped a back fence, trying to sneak in. Morales stopped him, Fees said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowlin said Morales shared a house in Santa Ana with his brother and several 
others and supported a 4-month-old daughter, who lived separately with her 
mother.

MANURE POWER FACES EDISON CHALLENGE; ENERGY: LAST SEASON'S HEAVY RAINS 
ADVERSELY AFFECT USE OF CATTLE DROPPINGS AS FUEL, DEALING IMPERIAL VALLEY PLANT 
A SHARP SETBACK. THE FATE OF ITS PACT WITH THE ELECTRIC COMPANY WILL BE DECIDED 
BY A FEDERAL PANEL.

<P>
 Michael O'Leary stood in front of the world's only cattle manure-to-energy 
plant, now idle, and called manure the dirtiest name he could think of. 
</P>
<P>
 "Manure is a hostile fuel," said O'Leary, the plant manager. "It really is." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not the only hostile thing in O'Leary's world. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on what a federal energy commission decides this week, his plant may 
be forced by Southern California Edison into bankruptcy, leaving it nothing 
more than a 140-foot-tall monument to a failed excremental vision and a change 
in the nation's energy outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 How things got this way is a story of manure, beef and energy politics. 
</P>
<P>
 The world has untold billions of head of cattle but it had not one cattle 
manure power plant until a group of American investors teamed up with West 
German technocrats in the mid-1980s to build the $47-million experimental plant 
in the Imperial Valley, where cattle outnumber people. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant fired up for business in 1988 and began selling power to Edison 
under a program devised during the Jimmy Carter Administration that requires 
the giant utilities to buy power from independent producers who use alternative 
sources, such as wind, solar and geothermal. The contract with Edison calls for 
the manure plant to supply 15 megawatts of power, enough to light 15,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid much bonhomie about being "entremanures" and manure moguls, the investors 
were in the chips for several years. The cattle in the nearby feedlots produced 
plenty of manure, the plant burned the manure to turn the generator, and Edison 
kept sending checks. 
</P>
<P>
 For the valley's cattlemen, the Mesquite Lake plant was a godsend. Instead of 
paying farmers to haul the stuff off, the cattlemen were able to sell their 
manure to the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was wonderful," said Edward (Jiggs) Johnson, a co-owner of El Toro Land & 
Cattle Co. in Heber. 
</P>
<P>
 Then along came the torrential rains of early last year. The fractious 
chemical nature of manure, never easy to deal with even in the driest of times, 
became impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 The manure got soaked and the plant's boilers suffered rust and other gaseous 
problems. The plant that had consumed 1 million tons of manure in the previous 
five years lost its ability to turn manure into power. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, the plant is not back on line. If it flops, cattlemen are not 
sure what they will do with the mountains of manure that are the byproduct of 
their industry. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, the federal Clean Water Act becomes effective for 
feedlots next year. Owners could be subject to stiff fines, even prosecution, 
if manure is discovered to be polluting local waters. 
</P>
<P>
 The water act and the possible death of the manure plant could not have come 
at a more inopportune time for the Imperial Valley, which has three-quarters of 
California's feedlot cattle and, if all goes as planned, could have more cattle 
-- and manure -- in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 Some feedlots hope to expand their herds to break into the NAFTA-era beef 
market in Mexico. Also, the county's economic planners are trying mightily to 
lure dairy farms away from urbanizing areas such as Chino. 
</P>
<P>
 The specter of more manure and no place to put it has Juan Guerrero, livestock 
adviser for the UC Cooperative Extension office in Holtville, predicting an 
economic and environmental crisis if the plant shuts down. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what they say about cattle manure rolling downhill," Guerrero said. 
"Well, we live in a valley here." 
</P>
<P>
 Upward of 450,000 cattle pass through the Imperial Valley feedlots each year, 
spending several months fattening up on their way to slaughterhouses in Los 
Angeles and Phoenix. A single animal, munching contentedly on grain and corn, 
can drop 1,500 pounds of manure a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything that disturbs the cattle industry disturbs chronically depressed 
Imperial County, where unemployment hovers near 30% among the population of 
131,000. The cattle industry accounts for 27% of the county's agricultural 
income. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Imperial County, it isn't carrots, cauliflower or broccoli that's number 
one," Guerrero said. "It's cattle." 
</P>
<P>
 When last year's rains turned the cattle manure to a fecal soup, the power 
plant switched to natural gas to heat its boilers. To keep its 30-year contract 
with Edison, the plant has to provide a steady stream of energy. 
</P>
<P>
 The catch is that the contract limits the plant to using no more than 25% 
natural gas. To get a waiver from that rule, the plant's owners -- a group of 
South Carolina-based investors who go by the name New Charleston Power -- 
appealed to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon the plant found itself with two powerful opponents: the California Public 
Utilities Commission and Rosemead-based Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison argued that it should not have to pay 10 cents per kilowatt hour for 
electricity produced at the manure plant by natural gas. On the open energy 
market, electricity goes for about 3 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-cent-per-kilowatt figure is the price set by the contract for 
manure-produced electricity, a price that factors in the social and 
environmental benefits of using manure. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison figures it is owed between $6 million and $9 million for overpayments 
made to the manure plant in 1993. That represents the difference between what 
it paid the manure plant while it was using natural gas and the price it would 
have paid on the energy market for a similar quantity of electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Manure plant boosters say that the mammoth Edison has never been comfortable 
being forced to do business with independent electricity producers and is 
taking this opportunity to squash the manure plant. 
</P>
<P>
 They note that Edison also opposed two solar power producers in the Mojave 
Desert when they ran into difficulty and needed federal waivers. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission sided with Edison, 
calling the manure plant technology a failure. The manure plant owners appealed 
and hired Carol Smoots, a Washington attorney with a record of beating Edison 
on such appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Edison has taken a very hard line on any technological problems or need for 
waivers," Smoots said. "Their preference is that these plants go out of 
business, in my opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for Edison say the company is only looking out for its customers, 
who should not have to pay inflated prices for electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not out to put them (the manure plant) out of business," said Jack 
Fenelon, Edison's program manager for efficiency monitoring. "That's not our 
play. We want to work with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Smoots, teamed with San Diego attorney Bill Eigner, argues that it would be 
"incredibly shortsighted" for the regulatory commission to abandon the manure 
plant. The glut of hydro-electric power could dry up, she said, leaving the 
nation again hunting for alternative sources. 
</P>
<P>
 But local politicians, who have seen the federal government seemingly turn a 
deaf ear to other problems in the Imperial Valley, like the fetid New River, 
fear the worst. "Edison has a lot more clout than we do," said Imperial County 
Supervisor Wayne Van de Graaff. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission is set to consider the plant's appeal Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 If the commission rejects the appeal and orders plant investors to pay Edison, 
it could bankrupt the venture, just as it is getting close to solving its 
technological problems, O'Leary and Smoots said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding an alternative venue for the manure will not be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Cattle manure is high on salt and low on nitrogen and thus not favored by 
farmers for fertilizer. When it is used on crops, additional irrigation is 
required, although that might not be feasible once the Clean Water Act kicks 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a big, expensive, smelly problem," said Jiggs Johnson of the 
El Toro feedlot. Jim Moiola of the Moiola Bros. feedlot in Brawley agreed. 
"It's going to be a hell of a mess."

GUN BILLS FACING BIG BARRICADES; LEGISLATURE: BACKERS OF NEW CONTROLS HAVE

<P>
 In spite of the Legislature's election year war on crime, enactment of 
substantive new controls on guns faces huge political barricades. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, enacting restrictions on gun ownership in California has been a 
struggle, even under circumstances considered favorable. This year, there is 
little optimism among proponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the Legislature has trounced a relatively benign bill that would have 
toughened penalties for illegally carrying a concealed gun. Another proposal 
limiting the number of bullets that can be loaded into a gun is paralyzed on 
the Assembly floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The chances appear worse for more far-reaching bills, which range from 
outlawing the civilian sale, exchange, manufacture or import of handguns to the 
licensing of handgun and ammunition buyers. Other proposals include limiting 
buyers to one pistol or revolver a year and authorizing local governments to 
adopt tougher firearms ordinances than the state laws enacted in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't expect to see a lot done with guns," said Sheriff Glen Craig of 
Sacramento, an influential veteran lobbyist for law enforcement who supports 
tighter regulation of guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Although recent polls indicate public support for some new gun controls, there 
are countervailing political pressures. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * The April 12 recall election of veteran Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) 
by gun activists and others has sent a political tremor through the Capitol. 
Whether he survives or not, Roberti's enemies have made a strong point just by 
mounting the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Election-conscious incumbents, especially Democrats in marginal districts, 
have been reluctant to support any move that could be interpreted by opponents 
as tinkering with basic gun ownership -- even for law and order reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * After suffering defeats in landmark fights over banning assault weapons and 
subjecting all firearm buyers to a 15-day waiting period in 1989-90, the 
National Rifle Assn. and other gun owner organizations have regrouped and 
helped elect several sympathetic candidates who are opposed to further 
restrictions on guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Pro-gun supporters have been able to frame much of the debate around the 
argument that Californians no longer can depend on law enforcement for 
protection and instead must arm themselves for safety. 
</P>
<P>
 At the outset, the new legislative session had appeared tailor-made for gun 
control reformers. Congress had finally overcome years of resistance by the gun 
lobby and passed the Brady bill, which President Clinton swiftly signed. 
</P>
<P>
 The national law requires a five-day waiting period for handgun purchases. 
California law is tougher, mandating a 15-day wait for the purchase not only of 
handguns, but rifles and shotguns as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun control activists also got a boost from opinion polls that reflected a 
revulsion with crime and support for a crackdown on firearms, including 
registration of handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should be the year to take back our streets from the arms merchants and 
their busy lobbyists," said state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who 
recently declared his candidacy for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) said he intends to introduce 
legislation prohibiting the civilian sale, exchange, importation or manufacture 
of handguns in California starting next year. Friedman, who is running for a 
Superior Court judgeship, has proposed the bill in spite of its poor chances of 
success because he said only bold measures can be effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition to sentence enhancements and putting more police on the street, 
we must take away the handguns that make crime so deadly," Friedman said in a 
memo asking colleagues to sign on as co-authors. So far, only five have done 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, retiring Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), a moderate, and 
Hayden, a liberal, introduced packages of gun control bills. One Hart bill 
would require handgun purchasers to be licensed every four years, similar to 
the licensing of automobile drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart said the California debate rages between the argument that citizens must 
protect themselves with guns and the contention that accessibility to guns 
makes California a more dangerous place. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a race between a civilized and rational response and a Beirut," Hart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One Hayden bill would repeal the state's preemption of the field of gun 
regulation and authorize city councils and boards of supervisors to adopt 
tougher laws than those imposed by the Legislature. Several cities favor such 
authority, including Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 But foes of gun control long have argued that restrictions on firearms enacted 
in the name of crime control unfairly target law-abiding citizens while 
lawbreakers act with impunity. Instead, they propose the abolition of 
plea-bargaining and tougher sentences for criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy (R-Monrovia), a leading defender of gun 
ownership, argues that imposing additional restrictions, especially in an era 
of high crime, "denies the right of citizens of this state to defend 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first showdown of the new session over guns, law enforcement came up 
battered last month in the Assembly at the hands of the gun lobby, Republicans 
and a handful of Assembly Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle was joined over a bill by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) that 
would have allowed district attorneys to charge people with either a 
misdemeanor or a felony for carrying a concealed gun without a permit. Now, the 
offense is a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by Republican Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren and statewide police and sheriffs 
organizations, Katz characterized his bill as urgently needed in the fight 
against armed street gangs and others. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents assailed it as veiled gun control that could subject otherwise 
law-abiding citizens to three years in prison. As an alternative, they argued 
for greater access to concealed weapons permits. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Democrats, who are more likely to vote for gun control than 
Republicans, heavily outnumber the GOP in the Assembly, the bill failed on a 
40-34 vote. Eight Democrats broke ranks to join Republicans in voting no. Two 
Democrats and two Republicans, both former law officers, abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz blamed the defeat on NRA lobbying. Law enforcement also drew private 
criticism for mounting a weak counteroffensive, a point conceded by Sheriff 
Craig. "It wasn't a full-court press. It probably was not organized as 
effectively as it could have been," Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the big push of the law enforcement lobby, consisting mostly of police 
chiefs, sheriffs and prosecutors, that made the difference in the narrow 
passage of the 1989 assault gun ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart said the active involvement of law enforcement also will be key in the 
1994 debate. "It's an important factor in the politics of the Legislature and 
gun control," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), who argues that guns 
"ought to be out of every community," said that although gun control bills are 
"always in trouble," prospects this session are especially poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gun lobby and the gun nuts in this state have an enormous amount of power 
because they have virtually 100% of the (Assembly) Republican caucus and some 
of the Democratic caucus," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said that if legislation empowering prosecutors to file felony charges 
against illegal carrying of a gun cannot win approval in a law and order year, 
"I don't know how they're going to pass anything else." The odds for enacting 
other anti-gun legislation, he said, "is going to be virtually impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 Critical to the outcome of gun control legislation has been timing and public 
opinion. The murders of five children in a Stockton schoolyard and the wounding 
of 30 by a madman firing an AK-47 provided the shock needed for the Legislature 
and Gov. George Deukmejian to ban assault guns in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, however, the police retreat during the Los Angeles riots and 
the subsequent rush by frightened Angelenos to buy arms was seized upon by 
pro-gun forces, who said it showed that citizens realize they need guns for 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy maintains that the public mood has swung in favor of guns since 
passage of the assault gun ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a great feeling out there that nobody can protect us," Mountjoy 
said. "I think they (gun control advocates) are going to have to prove their 
case a lot more this year than they have before." 
</P>
<P>
 In the shadow of the debate is the recall election April 12 of Roberti, Senate 
sponsor of the assault gun law. Roberti contends that gun owners launched the 
campaign against him in retribution for his authorship of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The implication, whether it is expressed or implied, is very clear: If you 
vote for laws that the NRA or members of the NRA don't like, they will recall 
you or attempt to recall you," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The NRA's chief lobbyist in Sacramento, Steve Helsley, said the NRA is not 
financially involved in the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sen. Don Rogers (R-Tehachapi), a pro-gun spokesman, said the recall 
election of Roberti is sending "a clear message to the Legislature that you had 
better stop interfering with our 2nd Amendment rights or you are going to be on 
our list of projects for recall." Gun Control Proposals 
</P>
<P>
 Gun control bills are facing an uphill battle in the state Legislature this 
year. Here are some proposals that have been introduced: 
</P>
<P>
 * Licensing: Would require handgun buyers to be licensed by the state 
Department of Justice after passing the existing background check. A onetime 
fee estimated at $45 to $60 would be charged. The tamper-proof license could be 
renewed every four years if the holder passed a safety test. (SB1275, Hart). 
</P>
<P>
 * Ammunition: Purchasers would have to display a state handgun license and a 
California driver's license to buy handgun ammunition. Now, those prohibited 
from buying handguns can legally purchase ammunition for pistols and revolvers. 
Also, the attorney general would be empowered to ban "cop killer" bullets. 
(SB1276, Hart). 
</P>
<P>
 * Magazine limits: In an effort to reduce firepower, the number of center-fire 
rounds in a detachable magazine would be restricted to 15 for pistols and 10 
for rifles. Detachable magazines for shotguns would be limited to six shells. 
(SB1128, Roberti.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Handgun numbers: Patterned after a newly enacted Virginia law, civilian 
purchases of a pistol or revolver would be restricted to one per year. The 
legislation is intended to gradually reduce the number of legal guns that are 
stolen and resold in the underground market. (SB1277, Hart). 
</P>
<P>
 * Seizing guns: Defendants named in domestic violence protective orders would 
be prohibited from owning or possessing a gun during the life of the order. If 
a court found that the defendant posed a reasonable threat of violence to 
someone else, law enforcement could seize the subject's guns. (SB1278, Hart). 
</P>
<P>
 * Local control: Local governments, reflecting local needs, could enact gun 
restrictions tougher than those imposed statewide by the Legislature and 
governor. The state has long preempted the entire field of gun regulation. 
(SB822, Hayden).

INSANITY RULED OUT IN KILLING OF ABORTIONIST; TRIAL: JUDGE DISALLOWS DEFENSE 
STRATEGY. BUT STATE WON'T SEEK DEATH PENALTY IN PROSECUTION OF ACTIVIST CHARGED 
WITH SLAYING DOCTOR IN FLORIDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An activist accused of killing an abortion doctor will not be allowed to use 
an insanity defense, a judge ruled Monday during the first day of jury 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael F. Griffin, an anti-abortion activist and Christian fundamentalist, is 
charged with first-degree murder in the March 10, 1993, shooting of Dr. David 
Gunn. 
</P>
<P>
 Circuit Judge John Parnham approved a deal in which the state will not seek 
the death penalty in exchange for testimony from a jail official who overheard 
a conversation between Griffin and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Parnham also warned that he would tolerate no outbursts, showboating or 
politics in his courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 After a defense attorney complained about spectators wearing lapel pins, 
Parnham said he was banning any items stating a point of view from his 
courtroom during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "This trial itself is not an opportunity for a demonstration," Parnham said. 
"The trial is not an opportunity for a protest. And this trial is not an 
opportunity for the lawyers to obtain exposure." 
</P>
<P>
 Gunn, 47, was shot three times in the back when he arrived at Pensacola 
Women's Medical Services to perform abortions while a protest was being held on 
the opposite side of the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin, 32, had wanted to use an insanity defense. Prosecutors argued that 
such a defense should not be allowed because Griffin, on his lawyers' advice, 
refused to be examined by a state mental health expert. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 146 prospective jurors who were called in Monday, 36 were excused for 
health, employment or other personal reasons. The others filled out a 
questionnaire, and 35 were asked to return today for questioning by lawyers. 
Others were to be called back later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Parnham has ordered that prospective jurors be identified only by number and 
that they be questioned in private on abortion-related matters to protect their 
privacy. He feared they could be embarrassed or endangered by their responses 
to such questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said he expects jury selection to take about five days and the rest 
of the trial at least seven days. He has ordered that the jury be sequestered. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowd-control barricades were in place around the courthouse. About 10 
abortion rights activists demonstrated on one side of the building, and half a 
dozen anti-abortion activists were on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, a passerby confronted four Griffin supporters as they held a news 
conference a block away. When the Rev. David Trosch, a Roman Catholic priest, 
said abortion was tyranny, Laura Cobham shouted: "Tyranny is when men like you 
try to take over the bodies of women." 
</P>
<P>
 Trosch was removed from his Magnolia Springs, Ala., parish last year after he 
tried to place a newspaper advertisement condoning the killing of abortion 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Trosch and other members of Pensacola-based Defensive Action said they do not 
encourage such slayings but believe they are justified. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight abortion opponents held a prayer vigil Monday at the clinic where Gunn 
was killed.

 A cargo helicopter returning from a lifting job flipped out of control and

 The victims were employees of San Jose-based Air One Helicopters, which owned 
the twin-engine Sikorsky S-58T helicopter. One victim had escaped injury last 
month when an identical Air One helicopter crashed into a San Jose rooftop, 
killing the pilot.

GORE MEETS WITH LABOR LEADERS ON PEACE MISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK SWOBODA, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore led a parade of Democratic politicians Monday on a 
peace mission to win back labor's love lost over the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore, White House adviser George Stephanopoulos and the top Democratic leaders 
of the House and Senate appeared individually before the AFL-CIO executive 
council, each preaching unity to a labor movement still licking its political 
wounds at the hands of a Democratic President and a Congress firmly in 
Democratic control. 
</P>
<P>
 After his meeting with the union leaders, Gore described the session as "good, 
candid and respectful" but acknowledged that the Administration and labor 
disagreed when it came to NAFTA. 
</P>
<P>
 The vice president made it clear that the Administration believes it could not 
win congressional passage of health care legislation without the help of the 
unions. He called labor's support essential. 
</P>
<P>
 AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said: "We are engaged in what I think is the 
most critical issue since the New Deal, the fight for health care reform." 
</P>
<P>
 But the object of Monday's meeting was post-NAFTA peace, and Gore spent much 
of his time meeting with union leaders to listen to their specific wants and 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The gathering of Democratic leaders was one of the strongest political 
showings in years at the annual midwinter meeting of labor's top leaders. 
Dozens of candidates -- from New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to California 
gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown -- were working the hallways and meeting 
with labor's political operatives to help boost election campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the meeting, House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), in an 
effort to put teeth into NAFTA, said he will introduce legislation to impose 
goals and timetables on U.S. trading partners to ensure they meet labor and 
environmental standards.

MARTIN MARIETTA REPORTEDLY TO PAY COST OF FBI PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Martin Marietta Corp. has agreed to pay $1 million to cover the cost of an FBI 
investigation of suspected fraudulent business practices at NASA's Johnson 
Space Center, a Houston TV station reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 KHOU, the local CBS affiliate, said federal authorities in Houston will 
announce charges today against nine individuals implicated in the probe and 
identify the involvement of at least two NASA contractors in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Giaramita, a Martin Marietta spokesman reached Monday, declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials said Dec. 2 that federal agents had posed as 
businessmen promoting medical equipment as part of an investigation into 
suspected fraud and kickbacks at the Johnson Space Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation targeted several large government contractors, a number of 
employees at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and more than a 
dozen employees at private firms, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Marietta, an aerospace company based in Bethesda, Md., said Dec. 3 that 
it was under investigation in the probe and was cooperating with the 
government.

MOGUL STIRS CONTROVERSY WITH HIS BLOCKBUSTER IDEA FOR SOUTH FLORIDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He owns baseball's Florida Marlins. He owns the Florida Panthers, the hockey 
team. He just agreed to buy the Miami Dolphins for $138 million. He runs 
Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., and he's moving big time into television and 
films. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he wants to build a virtual city on the edge of the Everglades, a 
self-governing, 2,300-acre sports and entertainment complex jammed with major 
league stadiums, a movie studio, an amusement park and golf courses. It is 
described as a place where whole families can stay for days and spend hundreds 
of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound like Disney World? 
</P>
<P>
 No, it's Wayne's World. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the ambitious plan to remake the entertainment industry, as well as the 
map of South Florida, is H. Wayne Huizenga, a 56-year-old multimillionaire 
sports team mogul, Hollywood contender and would-be Walt Disney whose latest 
venture has touched off a world of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Huizenga's plans call for a sports and entertainment village, with separate 
venues for the hockey and baseball franchises he owns, along with movie 
production studios, a "virtual reality" center, a museum, restaurants and lakes 
for water sports. 
</P>
<P>
 In his initial proposal, Huizenga asked state legislators to grant him 
development powers to levy taxes, issue bonds and maintain a police force. That 
kind of autonomy was granted to Disney in 1967, and some local officials vow 
never again. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that is going to bring great revenues to my city, and lots 
of jobs," says Mayor Vicki Coceano of Miramar, a town of 44,000 between Miami 
and Ft. Lauderdale that would give up land for Blockbuster Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the Disney agreement lets them do whatever they please, and that's not 
going to happen here. We don't want this to become a place with honky-tonks all 
around the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 No fear, says James Blosser, Huizenga's point man on the project. A rewrite of 
the draft legislation tones down the self-rule provisions and promises that 
Blockbuster Park will pay local property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last five years, Huizenga has risen from near obscurity to hero in 
South Florida by spending whatever it took to bring major league sports to the 
area. He paid $95 million for the Marlins, the National League team, and then 
shelled out $50 million more for the Panthers, the newest entry in the National 
Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
 When he announced a deal last month to buy the Dolphins, he already owned 15% 
of the team and 50% of their home, Joe Robbie Stadium, which is near the park 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 For Huizenga, his Florida operations are just a part of the plan. In January, 
Blockbuster agreed to merge with Viacom, which owns MTV, Showtime and the Movie 
Channel, in an $8.4-billion stock swap. Last week, Viacom won a tough battle to 
take over Paramount Communications. Eventually, that could mean more film and 
television production for Blockbuster Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Huizenga was born in Illinois to parents of Dutch descent. He worked as a 
truck driver while still a high school student in Ft. Lauderdale. He dropped 
out of college to devote his time to the garbage business and soon parlayed a 
small collection route into Waste Management Inc., now WMX Technologies, the 
largest waste disposal company. 
</P>
<P>
 Huizenga was a millionaire when he left Waste Management in 1984 and set about 
consolidating the fragmented video rental industry. Today, Blockbuster has 
nearly 3,600 stores worldwide and owns pieces of Republic Pictures Corp. and 
Spelling Entertainment Group. Huizenga's net wealth is estimated at $800 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the 30,000 acres for Disney World, Huizenga's Blockbuster Park 
looks relatively modest. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet few doubt that Huizenga, a consummate deal-maker who boasts of keeping 
score by counting money, has big dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what he has in mind is a world-class, state-of-the-art resort," says 
Broward County Administrator Jack Osterholt. "You fly into Miami during a 
three-day Marlins home stand, check into a hotel, play golf, the kids go to the 
theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this a rival to Disney World? Oh, yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists see a major tourist attraction in a sensitive wetland as a 
dire threat to an endangered ecosystem, as well as to the well-being of 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Which is more important, our water supply or sports?" asks Patti Webster of 
the Environmental Coalition of Broward County. "There isn't one good reason to 
allow this development as it is, and I think the public will explode on this." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Blosser does not seem worried. "There is a lot of community support for 
this. But with any development, an apartment building or a mega-complex like 
ours, there are always people who don't want to see it happen."

BANNING OF SIGNS FACES COURT TEST; PROPONENTS ARGUE THAT A ST. LOUIS SUBURB'S 
ORDINANCE WOULD FIGHT 'VISUAL BLIGHT.' OTHERS SEE LIMITS ON FREE SPEECH. 
</P>

 Three years ago, as U.S. troops geared up to attack the Iraqi army, Margaret 
Gilleo of Ladue, Mo., wanted to voice dissent. She put up a 2-by-3-foot sign in 
her front yard. It read: "Say No to War in the Persian Gulf. Call Congress 
Now." 
</P>
<P>
 But her town, an affluent suburb of St. Louis, had recently enacted a ban on 
the display of nearly all signs and billboards. The purpose was to preserve 
"the charm and visual quality . . . of this heavily wooded, rustic" community, 
a city official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilleo dissented from that view too and won a federal court ruling declaring 
the city law an unconstitutional restriction on her free-speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Now her case, Ladue vs. Gilleo, 92-1856, has forced the Supreme Court to 
confront a question that has divided the justices at least since 1981. Does the 
First Amendment prohibit cities or other governments from banning most signs 
and billboards? 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the court has permitted cities and states to restrict the 
placement of signs to certain locations, such as major roads or industrial 
zones. But so far the justices have refused to uphold a virtual ban on 
advertisements and political signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a quality-of-life case," said Diane Krejsa, a Maryland state attorney 
who filed a brief representing seven states in support of the city of Ladue. 
She urged the court to give government officials more authority to combat 
"visual blight" by restricting signs to those that provide safety or other 
basic information. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ladue ordinance, for example, permits little more than road signs, 
business identifications, religious symbols on church property and "for sale" 
signs in front of homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents Gilleo, says that the 
law, in effect, unconstitutionally blocks an entire category of free speech: 
political messages. 
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND: The justices in 1981 struck down part of a San Diego law that 
prohibited outdoor ads except those at a business address. But the justices 
could not agree on a clear rationale. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberal members of the court, who joined with moderates in rejecting the law, 
said any such restriction on free speech was unconstitutional. The moderates 
agreed that the law was flawed because it banned signs with a political message 
but not others that advertised products. 
</P>
<P>
 In dissent, the conservatives, led by William H. Rehnquist, said that they 
would support even a complete ban on signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my view, the aesthetic justification alone is sufficient to sustain a 
total prohibition of billboards, regardless of whether it is a historic 
community such as Williamsburg (Va.) or one as unsightly as the older parts of 
many of our major metropolitan areas," Rehnquist wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals in St. Louis invoked the 1981 ruling in 
Metromedia vs. San Diego to strike down the city ordinance in Ladue. "Ladue has 
singled out certain categories of signs for discriminatory treatment," the 
lower court said. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Rehnquist now the chief justice, the high court announced it would 
hear the city's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 NEXT STEP: Oral arguments will be heard Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The case gives the court a chance to clarify the law and possibly give 
government officials far more power to control "sign clutter," as their 
attorneys put it. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last two decades, the court has said repeatedly that officials may 
regulate free speech but may not forbid it. For example, police are permitted 
to restrict pickets to sidewalks and ensure they do not block an entrance to a 
building. They cannot ban picketing in an entire city, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladue city officials want to go one large step further and prohibit all signs, 
except those that are minimally necessary. If they win, it could amount to a 
major change in First Amendment law. 
</P>
<P>
 White House lawyers have entered the case in support of Gilleo. A "complete 
ban on a protected medium of expression" is unconstitutional, they say, because 
it discriminates against individual dissenters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Signs like the one at issue in this case are often the only way an individual 
can make a public statement," the Justice Department argues. A ruling in the 
case can be expected by July.

NEWS ANALYSIS; YELTSIN 'VICTORY' GIVES RUSSIA THAT OLD SUPERPOWER FEELING; 
BOSNIA: THE KREMLIN LEADER'S SARAJEVO INITIATIVE IS A RARE FOREIGN POLICY 
TRIUMPH. IT OFFSETS FAILURES IN FORMER SOVIET REPUBLICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Boris N. Yeltsin basked Monday in the glow of a rare foreign policy 
triumph so resounding that Russia felt almost like a superpower again. 
</P>
<P>
 By winning Bosnian Serb agreement to withdraw artillery from around Sarajevo 
and thus avert NATO air strikes, Yeltsin secured "a diplomatic victory for 
Russia on the scale not only of Europe but of the world," the president's 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a man out sick with a cold. Yeltsin returned to work after a 
nearly two-week absence on Monday, in time for the accolades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without a single shot, without threatening anyone, without putting its 
soldiers' lives in danger, without spending a single ruble, Russia has 
effectively won an important battle for its world status," said his spokesman, 
Vyacheslav V. Kostikov. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian success with the Serbs may or may not hold, depending as it does 
on the volatile situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. And Russian officials 
acknowledge that without the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's tough 
position on air strikes, the Serbs would not have withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yeltsin's Sarajevo initiative nonetheless served a double purpose, Russian 
commentators said. It won him desperately needed points at home by playing to 
Russians' sympathies for the Serbs, their fellow Orthodox Christian Slavs. And 
it gave Moscow a chance to clarify at least some of what is often a very murky 
foreign policy, placing the Serbs definitely inside Russia's newly forming 
sphere of influence. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it holds, this is the first broad-scale success for Russian foreign 
policy, in which Russia acted as an independent force with clearly defined, 
conscious national interests," said Anatoly Rassadin, an analyst at the 
Institute for National Security and Strategic Studies in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia didn't fall in line with the West. It didn't try to act on 
abstractions like democratic values or human rights. It just clearly defined 
its national interests and brought them into practice," Rassadin said. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of success is especially welcome now, because Moscow has largely 
failed in its attempts to define and apply its foreign policy in what Russians 
call "the near abroad" -- the other former republics of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeated attempts to quell the fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia and 
Tajikistan have gone nowhere. Moscow has managed to secure few guarantees for 
the 25 million Russians living in other former republics, the largest diaspora 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 It has remained deeply isolationist in the broader arena, still smarting from 
the cost -- in money and, in places such as Afghanistan, in lives -- of the 
extensive Soviet sphere of influence. 
</P>
<P>
 In the former Yugoslav federation, Russia has remained largely passive over 
the last two years, but when the NATO threat to bomb Bosnian Serb positions 
around Sarajevo grew imminent, Moscow apparently decided that it must be a 
partner in any international actions in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitaly S. Churkin, Russia's special envoy in the former Yugoslav republics, 
expressed Moscow's sense of hurt pride at having been too often pushed to the 
sidelines. He told Russian television that "the West should learn a lesson" 
from events in Bosnia. "And the lesson is that Russia should be treated as an 
equal partner, not the way some of them did it this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin acted in part under the pressure of political competition. Russia's 
historic and religious ties to the Serbs made the Yugoslav conflict a natural 
grandstanding issue for ultranationalists like Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, whose 
success in the December parliamentary elections appears to have pushed Yeltsin 
toward a more nationalist stance. Zhirinovsky declared in Parliament that he 
would view any NATO bombing of Serb positions around Sarajevo as "a declaration 
of war on Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 Although never as extreme in his rhetoric, Yeltsin too cautioned that air 
strikes could escalate the Bosnian conflict, and he told visiting British Prime 
Minister John Major last week that Russia could not be left out of any 
resolution of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, it seems, Yeltsin has been on the phone several times a day with 
other world leaders, and in a letter-writing mode as well. Working mainly from 
his country house, where a cold had laid him up, he appears to have run the 
most active diplomatic campaign of his presidency. On Monday, he continued his 
contacts, laying out his vision of the next steps needed in Bosnia to German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, he came out looking very statesmanlike, to the point that Kostikov 
crowed that "quietly, without haste, without superfluous publicity and noise," 
Yeltsin "showed who is the indisputable leader of Russia today." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sergei A. Filatov, Yeltsin's chief of staff, the president also 
showed that "the adoption of major decisions on the security of the world 
community without Russia does not work." 
</P>
<P>
 As Russia asserted itself, echoes of the old superpower rivalry sounded in its 
dire warnings of the possibly calamitous results of NATO air strikes -- hints 
that Moscow could be drawn into the conflict and that the Cold War opponents 
would once again face each other across the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the domestic pressure to defend the Serbs, Yeltsin had little choice but 
to sound a relatively hard line. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Russia had kept quiet and the bombing had started, it would have led to a 
colossal internal explosion in Russia politically," said Alexander Konovalov, a 
military expert at the U.S.A.-Canada Institute. "Maybe it wouldn't have gotten 
to the point of street demonstrations, but maybe it would have." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the faint threat of a return to Cold War enmity ended ideally. 
Instead of facing each other down, analysts say, Russia and the West moved 
toward a new kind of partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a deepening of Russian-American relations," Rassadin said. "The very 
fact of resolving a joint problem is a giant step forward -- just a giant step 
forward -- because our goals were identical." 
</P>
<P>
 And so far, each side appears to have received what it wanted most. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Serbs could keep their face and react to the ultimatum, and the West gets 
what it wanted with the end of the blockade of Sarajevo," Rassadin said. "And 
Russia goes from a passive observer to an active player."

MORE FRICTION SEEN AS MEXICO TALKS BEGIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peace talks between southern Mexican rebels and the government began Monday as 
local antipathy toward the Indian guerrillas showed itself in threats toward 
nuns in a nearby town occupied during a New Year's uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 demonstrators in Altamirano, a county seat about 60 miles from the 
talks here, on Sunday had given the St. Vincent de Paul nurse nuns a 2 p.m. 
Monday deadline to evacuate their hospital, threatening to burn it down if they 
did not. 
</P>
<P>
 When reporters arrived at the hospital Monday afternoon, the nuns said the 
demonstrators had not returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "They accuse us of being guerrillas, of supporting the Zapatista (National 
Liberation) Army," said Sister Bertha, one of 10 nuns who care for patients at 
the hospital. She was referring to the guerrillas' name for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Townspeople said they were angry that the nuns had treated nine rebels injured 
in fighting when the town was invaded on Jan. 1. Sister Bertha said the nuns 
also treated three police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We give the same treatment to everyone," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The confrontation is the most open example yet of local frictions arising from 
the rebellion. Many people in Chiapas, the state where the uprising took place, 
are resentful of the trouble the rebels have brought and worry about what will 
happen as a result of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials, such as State Rep. Juan Jose Reuda, are already making 
public statements about redistributing local wealth -- one of the rebels' 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those in Chiapas who have the most must understand that inequality leads to 
serious social problems," Reuda told reporters Monday in San Cristobal. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people blame the church for the uprising because, early in the rebellion, 
Interior Ministry reports said that priests were leading the guerrillas. The 
government had to back down from such statements when it accepted an offer from 
Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal, to mediate the peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 During a joint press statement, government peace negotiator Manuel Camacho 
Solis on Monday also retracted early government accusations that the movement 
was led by foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 Subcommander Marcos, the Zapatista spokesman, said negotiators had discussed 
the agenda for the talks, dividing it into national, state and Indian-peasant 
issues.

BRITAIN LOWERS GAY AGE OF CONSENT TO 18 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The House of Commons voted Monday to lower the age of consent for sex between 
men from 21 to 18, angering gays who had lobbied to cut the age to 16 to 
conform with laws for heterosexuals and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eighteen is not a compromise.It's discrimination," said Peter Tatchell, a 
spokesman for the gay rights group OutRage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commons first narrowly defeated an amendment to lower the age to 16 and 
then voted 427-162 to lower the age to 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister John Major, seeking compromise on a divisive issue, had backed 
the proposal to lower the age to 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal to lower the age to 16 was sponsored by Conservative lawmaker 
Edwina Currie and was backed by the opposition Labor Party and the British 
Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But many lawmakers felt that 16 was too young, saying 16-year-old boys are too 
impressionable to know their sexual orientation and could easily be influenced 
by older men.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: KENFIL INC. POSTS 70% DROP IN SECOND-QUARTER PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kenfil Inc., a Van Nuys computer software distributor, reported a 70% drop in 
profit for its fiscal second-quarter that ended Dec. 31, and said its losses 
from the Northridge earthquake Jan. 17 could amount to $3 million to $4

<P>
 In addition, the company said the earthquake halted operations for about two 
weeks and destroyed several million dollars of inventory. The company is now 
fully operational.

MASSIVE ASBESTOS CLEANUP UNDERWAY AT MALL; AFTERMATH: NORTHRIDGE FASHION CENTER 
WILL REMOVE EVERY FIBER OF CARCINOGEN. OWNER HOPES CLEAN IMAGE WILL BOOST 
BUSINESS UPON REOPENING.

<P>
 A few hours after the Jan. 17 earthquake, John Graham, vice president of 
property management at MEPC American Properties Inc., owner of the Northridge 
Fashion Center mall, made an urgent phone call from his Dallas office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm willing to bet there's asbestos in there, laying on the floors" of the 
shopping mall, Graham told Lou Magnifico, construction manager at Professional 
Service Industries Inc., an asbestos abatement firm in Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnifico hurried that day to the mall and took pictures of the heaps of 
fallen ceiling tiles and drywall. When Graham saw the photos, he spotted the 
telltale gray, fluffy material amid the rubble and said, "Uh-oh." 
</P>
<P>
 And so began a massive, multimillion-dollar asbestos cleanup and abatement 
effort at the Northridge mall, located about a mile from the epicenter and by 
far the most badly quake-damaged shopping center. Two other shopping malls, 
Topanga Plaza in Woodland Hills and Laurel Plaza in North Hollywood, have also 
undergone asbestos cleanups in the wake of the temblor, although nothing 
rivaling the undertaking at the Northridge mall, where the plan is to remove 
every bit of the remaining cancer-causing substance -- even that which wasn't 
dislodged in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Asbestos is an emotional subject," Graham acknowledged. Even though asbestos 
is considered safe if it is properly maintained, "our corporate philosophy is 
just take it out." 
</P>
<P>
 MEPC, a subsidiary of British real estate concern MEPC PLC, purchased the 
Northridge Fashion Center in December as part of a $302-million acquisition of 
several American holdings. Now MEPC is hoping to turn its bad luck into 
opportunity. When the mall reopens in July -- minus its six department stores, 
which will take longer to rebuild -- MEPC hopes to publicize its squeaky-clean 
shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbestos is present in more than half of all commercial and residential 
buildings 15 years or older, authorities say, and in some younger than that. 
Asbestos has several positive properties, including being resistant to heat and 
very durable. Unfortunately, in recent decades it has been discovered that when 
asbestos materials are moved or broken, they can release microscopic fibers 
into the air. If inhaled, these fibers can cause lung disease and other 
cancers. The substance is considered safe when left intact. 
</P>
<P>
 In any building containing asbestos, experts say, it is necessary to test the 
air to see how many particles might have shaken free in the earthquake. Air 
pumps with filtering devices are used in the testing. If high levels of 
airborne asbestos are found, a cleanup might include misting the air to weigh 
down floating particles, wet wiping hard surfaces and using big vacuums with 
special filters that catch the tiny fibers. And workers doing the cleanup must 
don special protective gear that look like space suits, which are later 
disposed of. 
</P>
<P>
 Clothes and other porous items from stores that have asbestos will also be 
bagged and sent to asbestos-disposal sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Things took an odd turn on Thursday when police investigated a report that 20 
members of an asbestos cleanup crew had walked off with new, 
asbestos-contaminated clothing from a Sears store at the Northridge mall. No 
one was arrested. Apparently it isn't a crime to take clothes that were deemed 
rubbish and headed for a toxic-waste dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Sears, which owns its store, was responsible for the asbestos cleanup and had 
hired a crew from CST Environmental in Anaheim. Sage Khara, CST's president, 
said he was outraged by the "theft" and fired those workers the same night. "It 
was a very devastating experience for us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 CST has also been doing emergency asbestos work for MEPC at most of the rest 
of the Northridge mall. Graham said that CMT has worked for his company for 
five years and they "have been reliable." 
</P>
<P>
 This week CST and other companies will bid for a new asbestos cleanup contract 
at the Northridge mall. Meanwhile, security guards are patrolling to ensure 
nothing is stolen from stores during the cleanup. "We made it clear to CST that 
heads will roll if it happens with us," Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbestos shaken loose in the quake has been a bigger problem at shopping malls 
than in many other large commercial structures in the Valley. One reason is 
that office and industrial buildings that suffered the worst quake damage were 
generally newer buildings made from concrete slabs, and many of those buildings 
don't have asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also, many office buildings old enough to have had asbestos included in their 
original construction -- say, some of those along Ventura Boulevard that were 
built in the 1960s and 1970s -- had already had asbestos removed. "There is not 
nearly as much asbestos in the Valley as there was five years ago," said Seth 
Dudley, senior vice president at real estate brokerage Julien J. Studley Inc. 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, asbestos abatement contractors have been busy since the quake. 
Asbestos cleanups have also been done at Cal State Northridge, a Kaiser 
Permanente medical building in Granada Hills, and the Superior Court in Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge Fashion Center, Topanga Plaza and Laurel Plaza were built in 
the '60s and early '70s, when asbestos was commonly used for fireproofing and 
insulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Those malls have all done some asbestos abatement in the past, as tenants 
moved out. But a comprehensive asbestos removal project would have meant 
closing the malls temporarily, resulting in lost business. And until the 
earthquake, there was no compelling reason to remove asbestos that was safely 
contained. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, Topanga Plaza and Laurel Plaza will have some asbestos remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 David Reed, director of facilities services at CenterMark Properties, owner of 
Topanga Plaza, said that over the years, asbestos was removed from 75% of the 
mall and all common areas. But after the quake, about 16 shops were 
contaminated when ceiling tiles were dislodged, exposing sprayed-on asbestos, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The total Topanga Plaza asbestos cleanup and abatement is estimated to have 
cost less than $250,000. Some shops will still have asbestos, Reed said, but it 
will be properly maintained and the air will continually be monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 At Laurel Plaza, some asbestos that had been sprayed in ceilings and walls was 
released in the quake and with subsequent building repairs. The asbestos 
cleanup will probably be completed this week, said General Manager Brian 
Pearson. When the mall reopens April 15, about some 80% of the asbestos will 
have been removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no reason for concern," Pearson said. "We are following the laws." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Lange, hazardous materials coordinator at Los Angeles property 
management company Shuwa Management, said that leaving asbestos in place is 
"absolutely safe as long as there's correct air monitoring." And Dudley 
believes the asbestos won't prove a long-term detriment to property values. 
"Even in high rise office buildings with asbestos, I haven't seen a significant 
affect on rental rates." 
</P>
<P>
 But at the Northridge Fashion Center, owner MEPC is doing a full-blown 
abatement anyway, despite a cost that will run into the "seven figures," 
according to MEPC President David Gruber. MEPC is expecting part of the cost to 
be covered under its earthquake insurance, although it is still negotiating 
with its insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25 store sites and some common areas of the Northridge mall have 
asbestos that was sprayed on the structural steel. The day after the 
earthquake, 100 workers began sweeping the corridors of the mall from one end 
to the other, bagging anything suspected of being hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
 The crews immediately started monitoring the air, and sealed off tenant spaces 
with plastic. On the thick plastic covering shops with asbestos, the word "HOT" 
was spray-painted in red. MEPC plans to clean 15 feet into stores that don't 
have asbestos in case fibers drifted in. Merchandise with hard surfaces, like 
jewelry, are being cleaned. 
</P>
<P>
 MEPC expects to complete the removal of all asbestos by May 1. Until then, 
floors are vacuumed each morning. Asbestos workers in contaminated areas wear 
respirators and the protective suits. They pass through mobile chambers where 
they remove the suits and bag them for disposal, then shower and change. 
</P>
<P>
 In many areas it's already possible to look up and see nothing but steel beams 
covered with asbestos. One column was so twisted in the quake that the concrete 
and drywall fell off in sections, exposing asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
 It could have been much worse. An asbestos crew was in the Northridge mall 
doing an abatement of any empty shop the morning of the quake. They quit early, 
and left through an exit near Sears. An hour later the temblor hit and the 
thick concrete ceiling above the walkway collapsed onto the floor.

DTS ENGAGED IN A PATENT FIGHT WITH FRENCH RIVAL; ENTERTAINMENT: THE DISPUTE 
CENTERS ON NEW MOVIE THEATER SOUND SYSTEMS DEVELOPED BY THE WESTLAKE VILLAGE 
DIGITAL FIRM AND L. C. CONCEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER PENDLETON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as Digital Theater Systems is beginning to make a big noise in the 
entertainment world, it finds itself embroiled in bitter patent and legal 
disputes with a French rival. 
</P>
<P>
 Digital, of Westlake Village, has won the financial backing of Universal 
Studios and Steven Spielberg, and provided the sound for Spielberg's 
blockbuster "Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Paris-based L. C. Concept sells a competing digital film sound format in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 It claims that DTS is infringing on its French patent and is waging a patent 
battle on both sides of the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office declared a patent 
"interference" -- a proceeding taken when two or more parties claim patent 
rights based on similar creations. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, businesses must apply country by country for patents. 
</P>
<P>
 But as part of an international convention, the United States recognizes 
patent filing dates in other industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Patent filing dates can sometimes end up determining who holds U. S. rights to 
an invention. 
</P>
<P>
 DTS believes that it will ultimately prevail, but it could take two years 
before the U. S. patent office makes a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 DTS President Terry Beard acknowledged that L. C. and its director-general, 
Elisabeth Lochen, have created "a tremendous public appearance problem for us." 
</P>
<P>
 DTS won the financial backing of Universal Studios, the studio owned by 
Japanese industrial giant Matsushita, and Spielberg in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jurassic Park" was the first movie to use the DTS format. 
</P>
<P>
 After Universal and Spielberg signed on as investors, several Hollywood 
studios introduced DTS in feature films. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, about 20 movies have been released in DTS, and 1,650 theaters 
worldwide are equipped with DTS hardware. 
</P>
<P>
 The L. C. digital movie sound system has been used on an estimated 30 pictures 
in France, Belgium and Switzerland since 1991, including "Cyrano de Bergerac," 
starring Gerard Depardieu, and "Cliffhanger," with Sylvester Stallone. L. C. 
won't reveal how many theaters in Europe use its hardware. 
</P>
<P>
 Digital movie sound quality is similar to that of compact discs used with home 
stereo systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Clear tones are produced with the help of computer technology. Since CDs 
resist wear and tear, they eliminate hisses and pops that sometimes mar movie 
soundtracks. 
</P>
<P>
 L. C. has had a hard time trying to break into Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 A tentative agreement with would-be U. S. partners -- including Jonathan Katz 
and several other Hollywood veterans -- dissolved in 1992 after a flurry of 
lawsuits that were settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 L. C. has been aggressively seeking financial backing in the United States 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Lochen said she knows that the odds are long. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she is struggling in a male-dominated industry, and also believes 
that her French nationality works against her in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 To her, the struggle is a matter of principle. "We are not as huge a company 
as Matsushita," she said, "but we own the patent." 
</P>
<P>
 L. C. claims that it holds rights to a digital sound technology through a 
patent its president, Pascal Chedeville, received in France. 
</P>
<P>
 He filed for the French patent in May, 1989. Beard, president of DTS, filed a 
U. S. patent application in September, 1990, on some elements of the digital 
sound system it now markets. 
</P>
<P>
 L. C. doesn't hold a U. S. patent, but if the patent office rules in its favor 
in the interference case, L. C. could gain a priority for its patent 
application in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The DTS and L. C. technologies are similar. Both deliver movie soundtracks on 
discs, separate from the film itself. They both feature time coding to keep the 
sound and picture in sync. The chief competitors to DTS in this country are 
Dolby Laboratories and Sony Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 They market a somewhat different digital system in which the sound is on the 
film rather than on a separate disc. 
</P>
<P>
 Beard says there are significant differences between the DTS sound format and 
the L. C. system. 
</P>
<P>
 One, he says, is the performance of L. C. technology when a projectionist cuts 
a film extensively. 
</P>
<P>
 Beard said the L. C. computer memory is limited, in contrast to DTS 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a new way of doing it. She (Lochen) doesn't understand how our system 
works," Beard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lochen says Beard is misinformed. She insists that the L. C. system can 
accommodate film cuts of any size. 
</P>
<P>
 The U. S. patent dispute is only one of a series of legal battles between the 
two companies. 
</P>
<P>
 L. C. has also been trying to stop DTS from selling its sound system in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The L. C. campaign against DTS suffered a defeat in Paris on Jan. 31 when a 
court dismissed a criminal lawsuit that L. C. had brought against the European 
distribution arm of Universal Studios, claiming misleading advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 The French company had sued in criminal court on the grounds that L. C. was 
hurt when "previews of coming attractions" for "Jurassic Park" in France 
promoted the DTS system. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacques Beugelmans, a Los Angeles attorney for Lochen, said the French court 
threw out the case on the grounds that L. C. should have sued DTS and not the 
Universal Studios distributor. 
</P>
<P>
 L. C. plans to refile the suit, naming DTS as the defendant, according to 
Beugelmans. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Universal Studios has filed a defamation lawsuit against L. C. on 
behalf of its European distribution unit and DTS. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit claims that L. C. falsely accused them of stealing its patent. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial date has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Universal and DTS have filed another lawsuit in London, claiming that L. 
C. engaged in unfair competition when it notified the movie exhibitors of its 
patent claims against DTS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lawsuits are popping up like cancer," said Beugelmans, who believes that 
Universal and DTS are trying to pummel tiny L. C. into submission with 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 DTS had sales of $6 million for the 10 months that ended in December. Lochen 
declined to give revenue figures for L. C., but they are thought to be much 
smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 Judd Funk, Universal Studios' vice president for legal affairs, said the suits 
against L. C. speak for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 L. C. has also hired the Los Angeles law firm of Lewis, D'Amato, Brisbois & 
Bisgaard to investigate possible unfair trade practices on the part of DTS and 
Universal. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, yet another L. C. attorney, David Makous, is considering 
filing a lawsuit against DTS and Universal Studios in two areas: Did DTS and 
the movie studio coerce U. S. movie theaters into buying DTS equipment by tying 
it to access to "Jurassic Park"? And, is DTS dumping equipment at artificially 
low prices to corner the theater market? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 DTS denies any wrongdoing. Beard says that DTS never forced movie exhibitors 
to buy its system to get the blockbuster film, and that hardware sales are a 
profit center. 
</P>
<P>
 Makous said he hopes to persuade Universal to strike a deal with L. C. That 
may mean a DTS purchase of the global rights to L. C.'s patent for a lump sum. 
</P>
<P>
 Or L. C. may be willing to accept a lesser amount if DTS and Universal agree 
to participate in an ongoing relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Beard insists L. C. has no technology that DTS wants or needs. 
</P>
<P>
 He's hanging tough, he said. "I'm not going to be blackmailed. The truth is on 
our side."

CHAD THERAPEUTICS REPORTS PROFIT SURGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chad Therapeutics, a Chatsworth maker of oxygen-conserving devices used by 
patients with respiratory problems, said its fiscal third-quarter profit surged 
71% on nearly as big a jump in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 For the three months ended Dec. 31, Chad earned $524,831, compared with 
$306,965 a year earlier. Sales rose 61%, to $2.5 million from $1.5 million in 
Chad's 1992 fiscal third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first nine months of fiscal 1993, Chad's net income rose 62% to $1.5 
million from $917,946 in the same period a year ago. Sales climbed 66% to $6.9 
million from $4.2 million.

DEAD LETTER OFFICE; QUAKE INDEFINITELY DELAYS OPENING OF MAIL FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Erected on a hilltop in the Santa Clarita Valley, it stood to be a paragon of 
the newly efficient Postal Service -- a $123-million mail-processing complex, 
built under cost, in time and with all the latest machinery to sort letters at 
lightning speed. 
</P>
<P>
 But three months shy of the facility's planned opening, the Northridge 
earthquake twisted and severely damaged sections of the 750,000-square-foot 
structure in Valencia, leaving ridges running along the asphalt parking lot 
like little speed bumps. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the facility, which was built on a backfill, has raised questions about 
whether the land was adequately prepared and inspected. No one knows for sure 
when the facility will open, putting into limbo about 2,000 workers who were to 
relocate there from an old, cramped mail operation in Van Nuys that has been 
straining to process an ever-increasing avalanche of mail deposited in northern 
Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, postal officials said, the earthquake damage is likely to 
cost several million dollars. And even if repairs can be made quickly, they 
said, the facility still probably won't be opened until early next year because 
it will take that long for Caltrans to repair all the quake damage on the 
Golden State and Simi Valley freeways. Both freeways are key arteries linking 
the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the federal government, Newhall Land & Farming Co. -- which sold it 
the 65-acre site -- and contractors are waiting for two geological analyses 
that are expected to shed light on what happened and what repairs can be made. 
Those reports are due Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's finger-pointing going on all over the place," said Ken Emerald, 
president of the American Postal Workers Union local that represents 1,500 
workers at the Van Nuys facility. He added: "Evidently, there is talk of 
litigation about who is responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Regan, the Postal Service's manager for mail processing in California, 
said no one was being blamed for anything at this point. But Regan also did not 
rule out the possibility of legal action. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we could run a lot of 'What ifs?' " Regan said, adding that 
she was eager to see the reports. "All I know is I walked through the building 
with a hard hat, and I could clearly see that nothing in the building 
collapsed." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing safety concerns, the postal agency would not allow reporters inside the 
facility. But from the outside, cracks were visible on facades. There was 
yellow tape around entrances, and in the truck dock area thick sections of 
concrete were torn, exposing metal reinforcements in the walls. Last week 
workers were boarding up those gaping sections and securing water pipe joints 
underground. 
</P>
<P>
 But hardest hit were the facility's two-story administration building and an 
adjoining employee cafeteria and locker room, which sank six to eight inches 
into the soil and twisted four inches. Engineers said those structures were 
apparently built on relatively deep backfill -- which is land that has been 
excavated and refilled -- that may have settled during the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Roberts, an engineer with Pasadena-based Jacobs Engineering Group, said 
the Valencia postal structure withstood the earthquake just as it was built to. 
But he added: "If you have some deeper failures in the soil, you're undermining 
the building." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, whose firm designed the Valencia postal complex and administered its 
construction, was at a loss as to why the parts of the building sank and 
twisted. Perhaps one plausible explanation, he said, was, "If you have some 
deep canyons full of sand, even if properly compacted, there's a reasonable 
possibility you're going to get some additional movement" in an earthquake as 
violent as the last one. 
</P>
<P>
 The postal facility was built on a cliffy area about a mile west of the Golden 
State Freeway, just north of California 126 and close to Six Flags Magic 
Mountain in Valencia. Newhall Land, which sold the land to the Postal Service 
for $26.8 million, prepared the site by excavating 6 million yards of earth and 
refilling the valleys around it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Horn, executive vice president of Sikand Engineering Associates, a Van 
Nuys firm hired by Newhall to prepare the site, said all of the soil and 
geology work followed Los Angeles County standards. Sikand completed the 
grading in late 1991. "We did everything from the county perspective," Horn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works said that county 
inspectors, while they approved grading plans before the work was done, never 
gave final certification to the postal project because of insufficient reports. 
Horn said that certification was subsequently not pursued because the federal 
government, which is exempt from county requirements, was eager to begin 
construction work. 
</P>
<P>
 David Sponn, the Postal Service's construction project manager for 
mail-processing facilities, said he did not know whether the federal government 
signed off on the land before building the Valencia complex. Sponn, who works 
out of Memphis, Tenn., visited the Valencia facility two weeks after the 
earthquake. "I was surprised at some of the damage, but it didn't appear to be 
life-threatening," he said. "I was glad nobody got hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 At the pre-dawn hour that the earthquake hit, there was a crew of 30 people 
working in the Valencia facility on bulk mail operations, which had been 
transferred ahead of time to ease the workload in Van Nuys. Those employees 
were in a 350,000-square-foot workroom, which was not much affected by the 
quake, although a two-mile-long overhead conveyor system appears to have had 
some damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The conveyors were part of a sophisticated assembly of machinery that made the 
Valencia facility the most technologically advanced among the 300 
mail-processing centers in the nation. Among the finest equipment at the 
Valencia plant were 10 high-speed canceling machines, which could mark out 
35,000 stamps an hour, while at the same time sorting letters by scanning bar 
codes. The 20-year-old facility in Van Nuys had only two cancellation machines 
that operated at half that speed and without sorting capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were bursting out of the seams," said David Moffitt, an official of 
National Postal Mailhandlers Local 303, another union at Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 When Moffitt started work at Van Nuys in 1981, the operation wasn't nearly as 
cramped. But mail volume grew 10% annually over the last decade before tapering 
off after the recession hit in 1991. Currently, about 5 million to 7 million 
pieces of mail are dropped off every day in the San Fernando Valley and 
surrounding areas. Postal workers in Van Nuys must process and sort these, 
mostly in one long night, so they can be trucked to airports and other postal 
offices for delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in the late 1980s when the Postal Service chose Valencia to build a new 
mail-processing center, bypassing sites in Burbank, Granada Hills and Pacoima. 
The decision was made on cost, availability and forecasts for population growth 
in the Santa Clarita Valley, said Al Iniguez, the Van Nuys plant manager. Now, 
he said, some of the new canceling machines in Valencia will be brought to Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a little tight, but we'll survive," said Iniguez, who like many other 
postal managers assumed his position in the fall of 1992, when new Postmaster 
General Marvin Runyon began a big efficiency push at the beleaguered agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valencia facility was to be model of the new, slimmed-down Postal Service, 
but last week, Runyon, a 37-year veteran of Ford Motor Co., flew to San 
Francisco to hear reports about the badly damaged Valencia plant. Runyon 
declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerald, the union official, said he and others thought the Valencia facility 
was ill-conceived to begin with, because it was 20 miles north from the main 
service area of the San Fernando Valley. Despite the added distance, Postal 
Service officials figured they could make up the lost time with increased 
automation, and many trial runs had gone off successfully. But that was before 
the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Many postal workers at the Van Nuys plant seemed to take the news of the 
delayed move in stride. Many didn't want to make the move in the first place 
because they had built their lives in the Valley and weren't looking forward to 
the longer drive to work. 
</P>
<P>
 But other employees were clearly disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyrone McCoy, a nine-year postal worker at Van Nuys, last year bought a home 
in Valencia to be closer to the new mail-processing complex. He was counting 
the days when he would have a 10-minute commute. But now, he said, "It's 
probably taking me an hour to an hour and a half to get to work" in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Moffitt, the union official who has worked for the Postal Service for 20 
years, would not even guess when the new Valencia facility would open. To his 
members, he said, "I'm telling them not to hold their breath."

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: POWERBOAT MAGAZINE IS MOVING TO VENTURA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Van Nuys-based publishers of Powerboat magazine survived the earthquake, 
but they're still leaving their landlocked headquarters and moving to a 
dockside location at Ventura Harbor in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided before the earthquake that we ought to be located on the water," 
said Jerry Nordskog, the magazine's publisher and president of its parent, 
Nordskog Publishing Inc. "One of our magazine's key features is a report on 
boats that we test ourselves.Now, we're going to have our own slip directly 
below our office windows." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to leasing second-floor offices at Ventura Harbor Village, 
Nordskog has moved a sister company, Nordskog Competition Center, into an 
industrial building a couple of miles away on Ventura's Goodyear Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 That firm manufactures speedometers and other equipment for the boating 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 With a monthly circulation of 60,000, Powerboat claims to be the world's 
leading publication in its field. 
</P>
<P>
 All editorial and administrative operations will move to the new offices off 
Spinnaker Drive next week, Nordskog said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the company is leasing its Van Nuys building on Strathern Street to a 
producer of auto parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last year, the privately held Nordskog concern also operated units that 
manufactured airliner galleys and battery-operated industrial vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Those units were sold in separate deals for a total of $23 million, Nordskog 
said.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: NESEN PLANS TO OPEN ROLLS-ROYCE DEALERSHIP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Is Ventura County a Rolls-Royce market? 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Nesen, president and chief executive of Thousand Oaks' Nesen Motor Car 
Co., thinks so. 
</P>
<P>
 Early next month, his firm will become the county's only retailer of Rolls and 
its sister British import, the Bentley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done marketing studies, and we expect to do well in Westlake Village, 
Thousand Oaks and in the western county as well," Nesen said. "We haven't set a 
sales target, but we're starting out with two Rolls and three Bentleys." 
</P>
<P>
 The cars are priced from $147,000 to as high as $337,000 for a Rolls 
limousine. 
</P>
<P>
 Nesen, who has eight other dealerships, is adding yet another luxury car line, 
the Excalibur, which sells for $55,000 to $65,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all buyers of these cars will be business owners, doctors, lawyers or 
movie people, Nesen expects. "We consider Malibu and the Valley to be part of 
our marketing area. Almost half our sales already come from those areas."

2 UNARMED SECURITY GUARDS SHOT TO DEATH; VIOLENCE: ONE IS GUNNED DOWN IN THE 
LOBBY OF AN ORANGE THEATER, THE OTHER IN A GARDEN GROVE PARKING LOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two unarmed security guards were shot to death within hours of each other 
Sunday night and early Monday morning, one in the lobby of a movie house in 
Orange and the other in the parking lot of a bar in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Dagoberto Carrero of Orange, a 23-year-old former Marine and veteran of the 
Persian Gulf War, died in a barrage of gunfire about 11 p.m. Sunday as he stood 
at his post inside the lobby of the Century City Centre Theatre near The City 
Shopping Center, police said. Police are looking for six teen-agers who earlier 
in the day had threatened him when he asked them to clear out of the theater 
after a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two hours later, Rupert Morales, 19, of Santa Ana was shot in the 
parking lot of Nick's Hide Away. Witnesses said Morales was attempting to 
direct a car to a parking space when someone in the car fired two shots into 
his chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said there did not appear to be any connection between the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Both guards were fathers of baby daughters and were praised by employers and 
relatives for their dedication to their families and their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never had any money; he always put practically his whole check into 
supporting other people," said Morales' employer, James Nowlin, director of 
security at Nick's Hide Away. "That's the real bad thing about this. It's left 
a lot of people hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange on Monday afternoon, shards of glass had been swept away at the 
movie theater where Carrero died by the time customers lined up to buy matinee 
tickets. A broken window was boarded up, and shattered doors had been replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous night, about an hour before closing, one or more persons fired 
into the theater from an outdoor walkway, police said. Carrero, who was 
stationed at a podium facing the front window, tried to seek cover after he was 
shot in the face, police said. But as he moved, he was shot a second time in 
the back. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunfire shattered two sets of glass doors and put a hole in the glass 
window of the ticket counter. With only one film still showing, the snack bar 
was closed and the lobby was empty of customers. An assistant manager heard the 
gunfire from the theater office and called paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrero was pronounced dead of multiple gunshot wounds at UCI Medical Center 
in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are seeking a group of six teen-agers -- three girls and three boys -- 
who a witness said had threatened Carrero when he asked them to leave the 
theater so that a cleaning crew could straighten up at 7:15 p.m. after a 
showing of the movie "Addams Family Values." 
</P>
<P>
 "Carrero asked them to leave so the theater could be cleaned thoroughly, and 
they refused," said Lt. Timm Browne, Orange police spokesman. "He asked again 
and they became hostile and started using foul language." Browne said Carrero 
remained calm and chose to walk away. The teen-agers left the theater about 15 
minutes later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bancroft, owner of Patrol One, the security guard company which employed 
Carrero, said the firm is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to 
the arrest and conviction of Carrero's slayer. He described Carrero as "an 
outstanding officer" who was "cool, collected, non-combative and 
people-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrero leaves a wife, Nicole, to whom he had been married about 18 months, 
and 9-month-old daughter, Jerelyn. Bancroft said Carrero's wife learned of his 
death when she went to the theater at 2:30 a.m. Monday, wondering why her 
husband, who had been scheduled to go off duty at midnight, had not returned 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrero had worked as a security guard with Patrol One for seven months, 
Bancroft said, after completing a four-year tour with the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrero was planning to leave security work in a few days and go to Texas to 
train for five months to become a member of the Air National Guard, Bancroft 
and family members said. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Bowen, Carrero's brother-in-law, said Carrero, whom his family called 
"Drago," was a highly decorated Marine who served in Operation Desert Storm. 
</P>
<P>
 "He obviously didn't deserve to die," Bowen said. "He was extremely 
considerate, extremely affectionate to his family. . . . He is the kind of guy 
if he had to dig ditches to make a living or pick up trash . . . whatever it 
took, he would do that to provide for his family." He said Carrero was saving 
to pay for a college education. 
</P>
<P>
 Bancroft said Carrero, an immigrant from Puerto Rico, "was a young guy on his 
way to fulfilling the American dream when he was shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove police, meanwhile, are searching for a motive and suspects in the 
killing of Morales at Nick's Hide Away, 8284 Garden Grove Blvd. Officials at 
the club said Morales was trying to direct a car into a parking space when he 
was shot twice in the chest by someone in the car, which was described as a 
dark, full-sized model. He was taken to UCI Medical Center, where he died. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Fees, owner of the bar, said the only incident earlier in the evening 
had involved an underage male who was turned away at the front door and then 
jumped a back fence, trying to sneak in. Morales, who was known as Roberto, 
stopped the young man, Fees said. The owner described the bar's clientele as 
mostly male members of the gay community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other security guard told me Roberto showed this kid out but it wasn't a 
big deal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before he was shot, Morales apparently called to a second guard, who was 
near the building's front door, and asked him to come over to look at 
something, Fees said. The second guard was walking toward him when he heard 
three shots and ran back inside to call police, the owner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fees said he has owned the club for three years and never had a serious 
incident there before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody liked this guy," said Nowlin, the bar's security director. "Outside 
the bar, he was basically acting like a concierge at a fancy hotel. He showed 
people where to park and tried to help them out." 
</P>
<P>
 Morales had a 4-month-old daughter, Karen, and supported the baby and her 
mother, Noellia Salas, 23, but did not live with them. He shared a house in 
Santa Ana with his brother and several others and also sent money to his family 
in Mexico, the security director said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowlin said Morales, aware of the dangers of his job, had hoped to purchase a 
bulletproof vest last month but did not do so, apparently because he had some 
unexpected expenses and could not afford it.

SMALLER PACKAGING MAKES MORE SHELF SPACE IN MARKET, HOME; MARKETING: THE NEW 
'90S WATCHWORDS ARE SMALLER IS BETTER, EVEN IF IT'S NOT CHEAPER. CAPITALIZING 
ON ENVIRONMENTALISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID E. KALISH, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bigger was better in the 1970s and '80s. Savers earned double-digit returns on 
investments, companies gorged on debt and consumers poured soap powder out of 
giant-size boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 How times change. Now even detergent boxes are smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 In a shift toward more frugal thinking, marketers have rolled out a raft of 
new products in more compact containers -- from super-concentrated soaps to 
slimmer disposable diapers to scrunched-up toilet tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 Influenced by the 1990s wave of environmentalism and sluggish economy, 
consumers now long for less waste -- in their personal lives and surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 The lure of smaller packages, which promise to ease pressure on landfills and 
are easier to carry and store, has even made some shoppers oblivious to the 
sometimes heftier price tags. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't want their personal environment polluted with trash," says Carol 
Moog, a psychologist and advertising consultant with Creative Focus in Bala 
Cynwyd, Pa. "It's a really different mentality." 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence of the new frugality abounds. Consumers seem less willing to 
accumulate big credit card debts. Companies are slashing hundreds of thousands 
of jobs to cut costs. Fashion wear is less flashy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the trend in the supermarket is a less commonly recognized indicator. 
Dozens of packages have been downsized or stripped of superfluous layers: 
</P>
<P>
 * Tide, Cheer and other super-concentrated powders and liquids in smaller 
containers now dominate the laundry soap aisle. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pampers and Huggies super-slim diapers come in packages that contain 25% 
less plastic and take up half as much space. 
</P>
<P>
 * Underarm deodorants have shed their decorative outside cardboard boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ultra-absorbent cat litter in seven-pound plastic jugs is billed as lasting 
three times longer than the regular 10-pound bag litter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Post this year introduced Bran-nola and Banana Nut Crunch in small boxes 
filled with more cereal than existing boxes up to 30% bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 The compact products please supermarkets trying to accommodate an explosion of 
new brands vying for room on crowded shelves, where three cubic inches is 
considered valuable real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend also has helped companies get the edge in supermarket sections with 
little potential for further profits or sales. Procter & Gamble Co., for 
example, says it was able to boost market share with its super-concentrated 
laundry detergents. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a sharp change from 17 years ago, when Colgate-Palmolive Co. introduced 
Fresh Start, a super-concentrated powder that sputtered because of limited 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Another plus for manufacturers is cost savings. The cardboard boxes for new 
concentrated soap powders and the plastic containers, for liquid detergents, 
use up to 20% less packaging material and weigh 20% less -- saving 
manufacturers about 20% on shipping, handling and packaging costs, said Michael 
Silverstein, a vice president at Boston Consulting Group in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 P&G actually raised the cost per load with the new super-concentrated powder 
detergents, at least initially. When the detergents were introduced two years 
ago, consumers paid 9.4% more for each clothes load washed with Ultra Tide with 
Bleach compared to regular Tide with Bleach, said Andrew Shore, an industry 
analyst with PaineWebber. 
</P>
<P>
 The price increase in powders went mostly to cover P&G's investment in 
research and machinery to create the products, said company spokeswoman Lynn 
Hailey. She said the company has since cut the prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The new liquids were priced between 4% and 9% less per wash load than the 
regular strength when introduced one year ago, Hailey added. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason consumers didn't seem to mind the higher introductory price is that 
it's hard to tell. While the new powders cost slightly less per box, each box 
handles only 33 loads compared to 36 for the regular. But stores commonly only 
list the cost per pound or volume of wash loads, not per wash, which is 
complicated for most consumers to figure out, Silverstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some manufacturers like to cite environmentalism in introducing concentrated 
products. But marketing experts say the main motivation is not slashing waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, about 40,000 items are crammed into big supermarkets, up from 12,000 
in smaller stores in the past. With smaller packages, manufacturers can 
persuade retailers to squeeze more on shelves -- resulting in more dollar sales 
per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Green marketing is just a nice perk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say the real motivation is the shelf-space issue," said Jack Trout of 
Trout & Ries, a Greenwich, Conn., market strategy firm. "If they can pick up 
some environmental brownie points while they're doing it, sure." 
</P>
<P>
 A&M Products, for example, says its extra-absorbent Scoop Away and Ever Clean 
cat litters "clump" around liquid waste, allowing cat owners to discard only 
the offensive portion. 
</P>
<P>
 Printed on the jugs is the message that the products result in "less waste 
than old-fashioned clay litter because you throw out only the clumps. And the 
less waste you throw out, the less waste goes to landfills." 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Lucchesi, product manager at the Danbury, Conn.-based unit of First Brands 
Corp., adds that the litter is "easier to use, cuts down on the amount of time 
you need to maintain the litter box, and in the long run it's a lot cheaper." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, retailers say not all the new compact products are getting a 
strong reception. P&G's Charmin Spacemakers, for example, are toilet-paper 
rolls with tubular inner cores compressed inside the package that expand when 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
 P&G says an eight-pack occupies the same space as a regular four-pack and 
fluffs out fully with just a squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
 But Margaret McEwan, a spokeswoman for Shaw's Supermarkets in East 
Bridgewater, Mass., says consumers may be confused into thinking compressed 
rolls mean there is a problem with the toilet paper.
